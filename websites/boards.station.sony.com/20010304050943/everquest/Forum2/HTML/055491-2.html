</FONT><HR>I am repeating my post from before as best as I can. It was short and sweet, so it should be close. :-)<P>|+|+|+|+|+|+|<P>Needs:<P>1. Make us as good in defense as warriors. Including parry, dogde, reposte and disarm.<P>Reason: Rangers with thier dual wield, good weapons selection and now same_as_warrior offensive skills will be balanced since they take huge amounts of damage. Make our defense just as good as warriors, we don't do NEARLY the damage of the other classes... period.<P>2. Make bash viable again. Make our (and SK) bash skill the same or better than warriors, and make it WORK on more mobs in the upper levels.<P>Reason: We use it, they don't. It makes us more wanted in everyday groups, as well as in epic situations.<P>3. Give us a defensive discipline for epic battles.<P>Reason: It gives us a fighting chance to get into the uber raids. We need it.<P> 4. Make our spells usable in group situations. Different or stackable with clerics, druids, shamen, etc.<P>Reason: If our spells are different and groupable, then we will once again be desirable in groups in the upper levels. Oh and LoH above 50 should be a COMPLETE heal, regardless of hp total, with lower refresh rates as you level up above 50.<P>|+|+|+|+|+|+|<P>I would forgo all the offensive upgrades and even moving spells down levels to let us use them earlier, if only we could get these 4 things.<P>Together these 4 upgrades could make us a viable class (more upgrades would be required to make us a DESIRED class).

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Well, first.. Thank you for the opportunity to speak Absor. I really feel for you having to do this, but I respect the fact that you are.<P>I will keep my statements VERY brief for you but I have lots of additional info/justification I can post. If you desire additional clarification , just ask. I will order in priority to me.<P>1) Spell fizzle rate. At the same time our manapool was increased our fizzle rate went out the roof. This truly affects our spell casting ability but has effectively hamstrung the 'time critical' spells like stuns and roots.<BR>2) Healing, Paladins are Cleric/Warriors .. heavy on the warrior. Still, we should have acceptable healing power. In the high end game a Paladins heals are almost useless. GH is laughable at the hp numbers we're trying to heal at 53/54. We can heal casters, as long as their not heavily buffed. SH isn't really viable till level 58 when you don't blow a whole bar of mana on fizzles. Please move SH to a lower level both for fizzles and to allow us a useful heal in the mid 50's levels.<BR>3) Stuns. A truly useful niche line ability that has been taken away. Around level 51 paladins start to feel the power of the stun line of spells and feel quite useful to groups. By 56 57 they realize that power has been taken away. The mobs in Velious and the raids/mobs encounters at the 56/57 levels are almost entirely resistent to stuns. I understand that it might be considered overpowering to have a stack of paladins chain stunning a giant who just sits there helpless. However, it's equally annoying to watch a blue conning mob gate or CH because you can't even interrupt it. The rats in DN do this continuously. The gating mobs are extra fun because you get to watch it return with enough friends to wipe your 6 group 55+ level raid out. Please allow Paladins stuns to recover some usefulness in the highend raiding game. Maybe a 2 sec stun .. but at the very least.. let the higher level stuns interrupt casting on most mobs we fight. Of course some mobs will never be interrupted, but please, they should be the exception not the rule.<BR>4) Please give Paladins some sort of defensive discipline or abilities. Replace the holyforge discipline. I don't know anyone who finds it useful. I do NOT think defense equal to warriors is unbalancing. In fact, we could use some AC help and maybe some parry, riposte help too. We are SUPPOSED to also be tanks. We are generally lacking and die time and again for it... but we are supposed to be.<BR>5) Please put an uber sword in the game for all religions. I love the idea of the Tunare sword. Paladins are loyal/honorable players and deserve rewards consistent with faithfully following a god for 60 levels.<BR>6) The Epic weapon quest is not level balanced due to the Nagafen/Vox level limits. Our server presently has alot of level 52/53 paladins running around with the epic weapon, while many of us higher level paladins still do not have it. I belong to an uber guild and we can clear Air/Fear any day of the week, usually with whoever is online. We have also hunted the Kunark dragons, enough to equip 8 or more warriors with enough scales for their epics. We still do not have any paladin epics. The issue is the books from the dragons. Kunark dragons drop them VERY rarely and Vox is still effectively unkillable. I realize the frost book can drop other locations, but the Naggie/Vox path is easy. This is my point. If you, at level 52, farmed Vox for a while (which many many people did) then your shot at getting a frost book was very high. The book, and thus the epic weapon, is not commiserate with your level. As incredible as this sounds, the proof is in the number of paladins playing level 50/52 twinks to farm the books off the old world dragons. Please use your logs to compare the levels of paladins who've obtained FD and at what level they got them. I think you'll see what I mean, aside from those that are successful using their twinks.<BR>7) Please give paladins a slight damage upgrade. Wether in weapons or in skills. Not alot.. but at the very high end game.. some mobs are mostly unhittable with our offensive skills. We should at LEAST be able to score some damage. It's amazing to sit there and be hit for 3k damage while you dish out an amazing 300hp damage. And this is NOT against the uber quading 800 flurry mobs. Just regular frenzied 55 mobs.<P>Thanks for your time.<P>Eagleeyes Mystified<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I have some concerns and opinions with regards to the paladin class.<P>I have over 120 days played on my paladin, many hours of questing and helping others included in that, just so you know where im coming from.<P>1. I have never had any issue with pre 50 paladins. I love my paladin pre 50 and with the recent changes and those being proposed on the test server I can say without hesitation that a pre 50 paladin is a great class.<P>2. Post 50 the trouble starts, specially if you were unfortunate to be over 50 when the fiery avenger quest went in and the dragon level caps were put in place. Another poster made a very good case for this so I wont repeat it.<P>3. I realize fully that we are not supposed to do massive damage HOWEVER.. with the changes being discussed I think I can safely say that we now do the least amount of damange in a normal combat encounter than ANY other class. That is to say if each class in a group were to attack to there fullest we would come out with the smallest amount of damage and yes im even counting clerics and chanters etc. I do have issue with this, small issue but issue none the less.<P>4. I am not convinced that simply upping our caps is a good or fair idea. I have many guild friends and am both old enough and objective enough to see that some of these changes..not just the paladin ones..will make other classes (warrior as an example) feel like they now are being unfairly treated.<P>5. I think that a possible solution is to put some items in the game to add balance. No drop class specific items to add balance..better yet add a level cap to make sure uber guilds dont just camp them for their paladins to loot .. As a paladin I am not supposed to (as per the vision) do massive damage and hit as well as a warrior and thats fine with me...now suppose my caps are not changed but my weapon is fairly good..when i do hit im doing some noticeable damage. honestly im not sure of all the mechanics and equations but I truly believe that just upping the caps is not the way to go.<P>6. possible spells that would offest the need for cap increases. attack spells that imbue our weapons with divine power..like divine might but rather than a proc it adds attack value and increases the damage rating of the weapon. make the mana cost high if you like and even put a delay for recast 20 min 30 min whatever..but make it last a fair amount. a possible balance would be that it lasts for 15 min and cant be reused for 30. this would make us more effective in both raids and camps without making us infringe on warriors whos combat ability is supposed to be constantly above us.<P>7. Defence spell changes vs increases to caps..ok here is an idea. verant has the ability to add spells to the database and it is done occasionally and no big fuss seems to ensue..ok so change the spell database so that all paladin defence and/or buffs have the exact same ability but now have a different name and allow them to stack with cleric defence/buffs. in this one action you give paladins a reason to be invited into groups and on raids and you add to our ability to stay alive in a fight without increasing our caps...so once again warriors have the highest offence and defence and paladins do not infringe..and add to that the warrior need not be upset as he can benifit also<P>Well thats about all i have to offer at this point and if i have posted material that has already been covered I apologize.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Reposting from page one of the initial thread, bummer it got wiped.  Thanks for taking the time to read our thoughts...<P>Greetings, <BR>I’m a level 52 Cavalier (and holding….) on Ayonae Ro.   This is what I would like to see.  I have no contribution  to the upper 50s conversation so will stay out of it.<P>1. Critical Bash – Make it so we have a chance to critical-hit with our bashes.   I can’t see how this would throw anything out of balance.  Seriously, my average bash at level 52 is in the mid-teens,  I was doing that at 35ish.  If this is intended, then so be it.  I have been a dutiful shield bearer for many levels, and I imagine that won’t change.  Rangers get critical hits in archery, doesn’t it stand to reason SKs and Paladins should get them with their shields?<P>2. Add an attack buff component to Divine Might – This spell is very nice as it stands now, but for all the work I did to get this spell (not to mention cost), I think this spell should include a small attack buff.<P>3. Defense/Dodge/Parry/Riposte – Don’t you think these are capped kind of low?  I see our cap has been raised on test for defense.   But isn’t that only a portion of the makeup of a characters defenses?  I personally think our caps in those other areas should be raised as well, certainly not to the max, but give us a fair shake.<P>4. Stuns at higher levels – Now I can see how you gents have been pushing us to incorporate new strategies in the higher end game.  One of the tools you seem to be using is eliminating a player’s ability to stun in the new expansion.  This reduces my class to emergency healer (laf.) and maybe *maybe* secondary tank in a caster heavy group (which are going by the wayside if you haven’t heard).  To date, there are only a few 51+ mobs (3 to be exact) that I’ve run into on Velious that are capable of being stunned.  What gives here?  Why have you removed a large component of my abilities?  <P>5. Effective spells post 50 – I’ve found one, Force.  And that’s arguable given the ratio and ineffectiveness of any stuns in the expansions.  Ok I haven’t found Flame of Light yet, but a 125 dd seems trivial *shrugs* this high in the game.  Above me, I see few promising.<P>6. Disciplines – Ever been taking a total beating on a guild hunt and have a rogue or monk friend of yours scream “USE YOUR DISC!!!” at you when everyone is out of mana and the high level mob you are fighting is almost dead but frenzied on your butt nailing you for max damage at least 40% of the time?  Then, after you get done loading,  you have to tell him, “”I don’t have one for that situation…”<P>7. Offense – I’m putting this at the end of my list because I believe we won’t see a change here no matter what we try to prove.  *rant on*  I hate missing…   It is NOT FUN to miss all the time…  I have filtered out misses and others attacks just to avoid feeling like a wuss…  There…  sorry about that rant.<P>I understand your apprehension at giving us too much, because up to level 50 we are essentially balanced well with warriors.   But level 50 is no longer the pinnacle, nor the measuring stick, as I’m certain you have become aware.  Since I’ve hit 52 (and it’s been awhile, I play often, but not a lot) and my friends and I have moved into Velious, I’m starting to see exactly what the higher level paladins are talking about.  In the guild to which I belong, I happen to be the highest level “tank” class.  This may change in the future since we’re starting a recruitment stage, but for now I am the meatshield on our hunts.   I have seen the evolution (and a bit of the regression) first hand.  Just a chaser in case you haven’t seen this Bogmog nails my impressions of late very nicely here http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053175.html.<P>Thanks for listening Absor,<P>Cyris Nytestorm<BR>Cavalier of Marr<BR>Officer of Sundered<BR>Ayonae Ro<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I think the Paladin is a wonderful class.  I've enjoyed playing my character, but as I've risen through the levels I've witnessed a definite lack of balance between Paladins and other melee (read tank) classes.  I think the proposed changes on the test server are a great start.  Thanks for them if they make it live. =)<P>There are a number of things that I believe would make us much more viable and balance members of groups.<P>1. LH should always be a complete heal.  Always.  It is our class defining ability and yet a cleric can LH (using CH) far more often.  At the very least please substantially reduce the recycle time at higher levels.<P>2. Paladins need a useful raid discipline.  None of this take someone else's damage stuff, sheesh.  I believe it should be an uber-taunt discipline combined with a defensive bonus (+100-150 AC) and/or a damage reduction (25-50%?). Basically, it'd place us at/near the top of the hatelist and make that MoB want to tear us apart but we'd be protected by our god's power.  I'm not sure on duration or recycle time, but I can see no reason these should be any longer than those of Warriors/Monks/Rogues disciplines.<P>3. Crits/crips against undead from level 1.  Warriors get them against all matter of creatures including undead.  Why not give us this ability?  Does it not fit the warrior-priest image of a Paladin?  Smiting the undead for our Gods?<P>4. Add more 1HS Paladin/SK only weapons with higher damage/lower delay.  We can't dual-wield.  I think we should be able to have 1HS weapons that could move us back close to the damage a dual wielding class could do.  I'm talking about bringing us "close" to what those classes can do, not surpassing but at least getting us closer.<P>5. Allow Paladin/SK's to Bash with all 2HS/2HP/2HB weapons.  If you want us not to use our shields, at least don't take away our ability to bash/stun our opponents.  It's one of the things we do well.<P>6. Increase Bash skill equal Warrior cap.<P>7. Increase dodge/parry/riposte skills to slightly below warrior caps.  If you want us to tank at least make it possible for us.<P>8. Add more high-level (45+) undead.  How about an undead Dragon?  Just a thought. =)<P>9. Paladiin only high level spells that stack with cleric buffs.<P>10. Please replace the summon hammer line with viable useful spells.  As it stands the summoned weapons are nearly useless, even if only used to beat on aggroed low greens while on a corpse run.  Even summoning food and water are preferable to the hammer line. As a night-blind human I do appreciate the summon halo spell.<P>Hmm, I think that's all for now.  Might be back later though.  Thank you for listening and for your time.<P>Deladar Gorthain<BR>46 Paladin<BR>Lanys T'Vyl<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I won't go into great detail here as many<BR>people already have.  I'll just address<BR>3 concerns.  The first is major and the other<BR>2 are just kinda gripes:<P>  1.  The need for an identity.  Right now<BR>most people think of Paladins as tanks with nothing special about them...we have some spells and that makes us different. But you'll never hear anyone say get that pally cause he has such and such spell.  Please give us a stronger identity! Define what a paladin is!<P>  2.  Risk vs. Reward on quests.  This is a biggie. <BR>     Aegis of Life.  I didn't level for a good couple of weeks on the Aegis waiting for grimrot (who I still haven't got).  Maybe you should consider making the Aegis where it doesn't need<BR>to be recharged but has something like a once a day effect.<BR>     Soulfire.  I like it for what it stands for, but I usually only weild it when I'm on my way somewhere.  My Mith 2hander that I traded 2 forest loops for is a better weapon--and I didn't become KOS in freeport for it.  I was 35 when I got the Soulfire and already had my Mith2Hander.<BR>I just wish I could use it more. <BR>     Armor of Ro.  These quests are very long and I've gotten almost a full set of Ry'gorrs now.  Why should I bother to do them at 35?  <P>3.  Please give us some 1hs weapons that we can use shields with.  Some that aren't supremely difficult to get.  Maybe make Soulfire 1hs =)<P>Again my main concern is the 1st.  It's the one<BR>we can't live without being addressed.  Give us an identity and make us the best ad fulfilling it.<P>Gowry</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

But, I do have one comment on a spell I would move:<P>Shadowknights receive feign death at 30... it was originally designed as an escape spell, but players being who they are  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">, it sees a lot of use in various pulling tricks.<P>The paladin escape spell is Divine Aura--but paladins don't get it until 55.<P>I've always liked how paladins and shadowknights were opposites of one another, and I think that moving Divine Aura to 30, or else giving them a more limited version (maybe halve the duration) would make a lot of sense.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've been playing a paladin since day 1..way back on March 22 99.  I've seen every complaint in and around the game from paladins.  The changes from the test server are welcome ones.  We are a defensive based class..so pushing up our defense to match warriors is a good change.  However, we are still lacking in just a few areas.<P>1 - Shields and Sword...  As others have said, we need some new shields that are higher AC, and have some sort of bonus to going with one handed weapons and a shield over a 2 hander.  Currently, contrary to Verant's belief, most paladins don't walk around with 2 handers loving life.  They have 2 handers because that's the only viable weapon Paladins have at the moment.  For one handers, we have 3 major choices after 50..Sword of the Morning, Sword of Blessings, and Zephyrwind.  That's about it.  If you don't have one of those, you have a Wurmslayer, which while a nice weapon, drains you quite fast of your stamina and leaves you dry on those long fights.  Give us some shields with higher AC than the usual 25, and possibly have them proc as well, or atleast have a decent stat bonus.  Basically give us more options than 5 weapons after lvl 50.<P>Disciplines - The current disciplines pally's have are, well..lackluster.  All the other hybrids have a defensive, and offensive Discipline that are usefull either in major raids, or on a day to day basis.  Give us one that is defensive based.  Something like an automatic blocking with shields, or automatic parrying for 1 minute.  Something to absorb blows by the mobs so they don't take away HPs.  Something to the effect of Rune or something like that.  As far as an offensive discipline, the criplling blows against undead at 55 is nice...but really...when is it absolutely neccessary to use this discipline?  We have LoH which works in all situations...possibly making a discipline that spreads the LoH out or something like that (but that's stretching it).<P>Basic stuff that's been said... Higher Defensive ability is a welcome change, and I'm happy for it.  Another nice change would be some extra stun spells that are effective above lvl 55 mobs.  Currently we have no stuns that work on 55+ baddies, and it would be nice to actually have stuns work, being that defines the pally class in some groups.  <P>Other spell ideas...a spell that bolsters group defense (ie. faith in battle) Being that paladins are "warriors of faith" we should be able to bolster our groups to higher acts of valor.  A spell that is like group fearless or something along those lines, again..going on the natural leader of the group thing with faith.  <P>Spells that define which God you follow as a paladin:  <BR>Mith marr spells = Defense<BR>Tunare spells = Healing<BR>Prexus spells = Buffing<BR>Rodcet Knife = Offense <BR>etc etc.<P>That last one is something that I haven't seen yet.  Considering paladins are warriors of God, we should represent which god we beleive in with an appropriate spell or two.  Only 2 or 3 spells should be religion based, and can be quest or bought or both.  I think this would be a really good addition, and can actually be something that would work for all classes actually.<P>In summary, Pally's need some new shields and new one handed swords...more variety is needed here. Give us a discipline that utilizes our defensive ability, something that absorbs blows over a brief period of time, or a group feerless/protect spell.  Religion based spells would be nice as well to help go along with the religous jewelry that's now in game.  Our higher defensive ability is a welcome change, but I wouldn't fight any extra Hp's thrown our way either (if we're supposed to be defensive, we should be able to take the hits...like Lola said in another post...sometimes Mages pet's outlive us).<P>My 2 cents, hopefully it won't be taken in vain.<P>God speed and good luck to all the pally's out there still kicking.<P>53 Pally Chica<BR>Aerianna Deus<BR>"Goddess" of Lmalla</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Another paladin friend of mine has the same case but with more raid experience. Maybe our luck sucks but I would appreciate a look at the Val drops.

</FONT><HR><BR>- Yaulp IV. Perfect match for the paladin class.<P>- Increase offensive and weapon skills so at lvl 60 we can hit the mob enough to taunt it and make a different to the raid.<P>- All the talk about comparing paladin AC to warriors and others is sorta useless if we can't get our equipment. In SoV, all melee classes but paladins and rangers can get nice armor in PoG. It's easy to get to, and easy with the right group mix to get armor nicer that any other zones. Compare that to the paladin loot drops, and you should see a serious balancing issue.<P>- Where's the 1H paladin weapons?<P>- LoH should have a reduced recycle time as you approach lvl 60.<P>- Plane of Sky quests. Only 2 have be completed. Consider updating the drop ratios or the encounters need for the remaining 2 weapons. This could add new reason to go back to Sky and help with paladin need for better weapons.<P>- Holyforge discipline. Not useful in it's current state. Making it all crits or crippling for a shorter period would make it a useful discipline. Since it's undead only, it's naturaly mob limited and in line with the roleplay aspect of paladins as warriors against undead. Making this a nature ability of the paladin would also be nice.<P>- If we are being considered defensive hybrid only, we need a defensive discipline. We're missing it.<P>- Up to lvl 55, paladins are consider best at stunning and bashing mobs. To interrupt spell casting, and stop mobs from gating. With mobs 55+, we can't do that. So, we have no clearly defined role.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1) like i said b4, atm warrs deal the most dmg and tank the best for melee class. rougs and mks all have their uses and deal very good dmg. why not make paladins and SKs THE best tanking class in the game ie highest AC and stuff? our dmg output would still be one of the lowest, just that we can 'tank' the best. (pls not suggesting we nerff warrs and such, just improve us).<P>2) perhaphs increase our resistance to magic, fire poison etc VERY high, in a stepwise lv way, such that at for example high lvs we r able to resist spells and poison, fear effects better than all other classes. and no i'm not talking about a 5 point inate increase in our poison resist is called balancing us.<P>3) give us spells that at our lvs, esp at high lvs, that will be useful. i'm not talking about clerical DDs and stuff, but buffs that will stack with clerical ones, the lv 59-60 200 hp buff is a good start, but at lv 60....<P>a) soothe line of spells sould have their resistance lowered to make them useful.<P>b) buffs need to be reassesed for their usefullness. making buffs that do stack would be a very good idea imo.<P>c) why do we not get improved invis to undead?<P>d) stun line of spell needs resistance lowered a bit, due to the fact that we r getting 10-20 lvs lower clerical ones.<P>some more thoughts on paladin improvements<BR>1)LoH should be changed to heal fully (ie CH) or to have the 60 min timer decreased at higher lvs<P>2)if we are suppose to be 'defensive tanks' accoding to the vision, then make us defensive tanks... increase our ac and defensive caps to equal or above that of warriors.<P>3) the 72 min reuse timer for our disaplines r awefully long, pls bring them to par with the other melee classes<P>4)why not give us natural crits to undead? without duel wield our dmg output would still be way below others.<P>5) if so then why not change santification (our crit vs undead disc) into something much more useful for us for example like upon use of disc we have a chance to STUN our target, and the stun would even include normally un-stunnable mobs like trak and others.<P>like someone said in another post, please dont think of us as 'hybrids' but rather paladins, SKs and rangers as classes unto their own. also please dont say that 'well the reason u do not get better is because u get spells'... well paladin spells at high levels r virtually useless, and totally useless for ubber mob encounters, we cannot heal well ( due to spells and limited mana), our buffs will NOT be used, the mobs r un-stunnable, lull does not work, root... i hope u see and understand.<P>6) oh yes pls add more undead ubber mobs as well.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One other thing I forgot to mention with shields...make our bash more effective.  Hell warriors can stun with their kick at 55...I'm sure their regular kicks do more than 5 - 10 dmg per shot.  Our Bash, even at master, still does a tasty little 15 points MAX.  This is just plain crappy.  We use that bash to interupt spells and while having it hit the mobs to interupt is nice, that little 10 HP's isn't doing much good in the long run.  I've never said Paladins should be offensive at all..but this skill does need an overhaul..and bad.<P><BR>Aerianna Deus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Dang, I had a bunch of stuff in the other thread..I hope you got to read my post hehe.  In any case, I am going to try to remember my suggestions:<P>1.  Let Natures Defender be an alternative to the Fiery Avenger in the Fiery Defender quest.  I hate to see paladins suiciding to get those dang books hehe.  <P>An alternative to this would be to put in some more dragons that are Naggy/Vox's Level so we can get our books a little faster.  As it is, we only have the opportunity for 1 book per dragon per week which means that there is a good chance you could be waiting a LOOONNGG time for them hehe.<P>2.  Raise all defensive skills (Parry, Dodge, Riposte, and Defense) up to the same level as a warriors.  You should also raise our offense also since we paid for our spells with lowered caps and fewer abilities/disciplines....yet those who didn't pay these penalties are now casting  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/redface.gif">\.  It only seems fair that if a warrior can cast, we should have there abilities and skill caps.<P>An alternative to this might be to put the abilities or disciplines on armor or items.  Put some items in the game that are hybrid only and have effects of things like "Duel Weild" or "Mighty Strike".  A real popular item would have Crits and Crips since they are so much fun.<P>3.  Give us Superior Heal earlier.  We should be able to step into a group and act as a healer...we can't do this post 50 cause our heal is to small.  I suggest making Superior Heal a level 51 spell.  We are part cleric, part warrior, but the only role we can play (on a limited basis) is a warrior.<P>4.  Give us a line of unresistable stuns that only interrupt casting.  This would make us usefull on large raids.  I wouldn't say it is unbalancing since there is no damage component and it wouldn't stop the attacker from attacking. It would just interrupt casting.<P>5.  We need better weapons.  Take a look at the currently available weapons for all hybrid/melee classes and you will notice that we have the slimmest selection of weapons.  I personally have been using the Mith 2h for about 20 levels.  Don't get me wrong, I love my Mith, but I would like to have a few options in my upgrade path that don't require me to camp for 30+ hours or to spend 15k+.<P>I would also like to see some sheilds with a proc.  I think that would be a pretty neat idea.<P>4.  Divine Might Quest is to hard when you consider the spells usefullness.  I admit, it is nice, but not so nice as to cost 1.5k and 5+ hours to obtain.  Not to mention the final battle with a skelle I hear is very tough.<P>5.  Give us some Diety specific spells or something along this line.  Personally, I am waiting for Tunare to summon me in defense of the Tunarean Court, but if we just got a few abilities based on our Diety, I think it would go a long way in role playing.  I like the Natures Defender (I play a HIE pally) but I think we need more things like that.  I also would like to see Tunare give out quests and such.  This goes for all Holy Rollers (Clerics, Paladins, SK's).  We are forced to follow a diety so we should probably get a few benefits from it.<P><BR>That is all for now, since I have to go...  Stay tuned for more  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"><P>Caeelar Grailchaser<BR>51st Cavalier of Tunare<BR>Infinite Realms on Erollisi Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Paladins, I'm an SK, I posted this in the SK boards, but I think we BOTH should get this ability, I'll check back here and see what you think . . <P>From reading these threads and seeing responses by the people in charge, it seems to me the vision of hybrids is this:<BR>Rangers - offensive<BR>Bards - all around utility (and songs)<BR>Paladin/SK - defensive<P>Now, with this is mind, why is it that, although Paladins and Shadow Knights are supposed to be THE defensive hybrids, BOTH those classes are the ONLY hybrids that do not have a defensive discipline! <P>Rangers, at level 60, get Weaponshield. This allows them to parry ALL attacks directed at them for 15 seconds, making them invulnerable to melee attacks in that time. <P>Bards, at level 55, get Deftdance. This gives them the ability to automatically dodge EVERY attack AND automatically duel wield (off hand chance to swing will be 100%) for 10 seconds, making them invulnerable to melee attacks in that time and doing increased damage.<P>Now Paladins DO have a defensive skill at 60. Sanctification, making them immune to MOST (and I need a pally to tell me what most includes) types of harmful spells. If this makes them immune to "uber" mob AoE spells, this is an excellent ability. This, however, SILL precludes them 'taunting' a mob off a warrior to share damage, or off a spell caster to keep them alive because, even WITH a higher defensive skill, Paladins just aren't going to last against mobs that may very well be over 60.<P>Shadow Knights, on the other hand, do NOT have a defensive ability per se. Although it can be argued that Leechcurse, the level 60 discipline that heals self for every point of damage done, CAN be argued to be defensive, it is by no means an effective defensive discipline. Shadow Knights, according to Verant, are NOT an offensive class, we do NOT have the same skill caps in offense or weapons as warriors, rogues, monks, or rangers. We do NOT hit as often, and do not do as much damage, even with the same weapon, due to our lower attack rating. <P>If we can't hit, and do less damage when we DO hit, this skill is useless. I GUARANTEE you, if I'm supposed to be "defending" the others in my group and raid, and by this I presume to mean taunting and taking hits, the amount of damage I do to the mob and heal myself IN NO WAY will offset the amount of damage I take, being single, double, triple, and even quad hit for 300 to 600 (or more) points of damage per shot. <P>I propose either replacing or moving leechcurse down a level and replacing it with Weaponshield. This would in no way "step on the toes" of fighters (warrior/monk/rogue), given their ability to auto parry AND riposte every attack, but still give us the ability to actually 'defend' those in our raid and live to tell about it. The amount of damage we prevent with this will be MUCH greater then the amount of damage we can 'heal' ourselves.<P>For Paladins I would propose moving down Sanctification a level or 2, and Adding Weaponshield at 60.  Again, for the same reasons as above. <P>This ability alone would, at the very least, make us a viable option to the fighter classes if no or not enough are available. We wouldn't be AS good, but at least we'd be effective. And if WE are more effective, the whole RAID will be more effective. Fighters disciplines last a few seconds, when their discipline ends an SK could taunt off the fighter, keeping THEM alive, while still allowing them to do the massive amounts of damage they can do. If you want us (including Paladins, they could use this ability as well) to be "Defenders" then you have to give us the ability to defend. Otherwise, it's like telling us you want us to be pilots, and not supplying us with a plane . . . <P>- Vorrek, 52 SK, Quellious<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>What I would like to see changed in the paladin class.<P>Fix the amount that paladins miss against LvL 55+ mobs.  That wont make us hit harder, or change the fact we don’t duel wield and it won’t make us hit that much more.  You would think that an experience paladin would be able to hit his target just about every time.  Missing is for untrained farmers not a trained knights!<P>Add more types of shields to the game and increase our bash skill.  Warriors do not use shields so how can they be better at using them? <P>Change the effects on the Kunark armor to be something useful.  For them to cast spells that we already have is just worthless.  They don’t have to be offensive type spells but at least make them something we will look at using once in a while.  Daring on the helms isn’t useful for the lvl of the people using the armor.  Why would we use cancel magic on the gloves with such a long cast time?  It takes us out of the fight for to long vs just meming our spell and having them up and ready. <P>I would like to see more utility type effects like summons food/water/bandages.  How about a invigor that doesn’t have a  long recast time?  Even putting Yaulp spells on the armor with just slightly higher cast times would be useful and not overly powerful.  Lower level buffs that other class have be useful.  Similarly tot he pally legs having str buff.  This doesn’t make shamans and other classes obsolete, especially if it’s a lower level spells.  A lvl 52 pally casting a lvl 19 shaman agi buff isn’t going to make a lvl 52 shamen obsolete!  Its also not going to be overly powerful!  It will be usable once in awhile!  Any stamin or stat buffs could be used.<P>Change our disciplines to some thing useful and to what our class is about.   Our level 51 discipline resistant is ok.  Its useable and helpful and not to powerful.  Lvl 54 Fearless is all but useful in dragon runs the fights last a long time and the eleven second duration is all but useless in long fights.  Lvl 55 holyforge is also useless, the chance that we will get a critical is like a proc going off on a weapon (it just doesn’t happen much).  Lvl 60 I am not sure about since I do not have this one.<P>The only discipline that makes sense is holyforge.  This one needs to be cut down to 10 seconds of criticals against undead only but to be every hit be a critical.  This will not give us a banner discipline since there really are not that many undead mobs in the world but it will be useful. <P>How about a discipline that makes our taunt work every time for duration of 1min.  Or even an aoe taunt?<P>I have also seen thoughts on a discipline that allows us to take the damage or even partial damage of a selected target.   This would be what paladins are all about, protecting others.   Make it long re use and fairly short duration as long as it takes most if not all the damage.   I have a mental image of a paladin defending a cleric from hosts of mobs!<P>Paladins as a class are back up healers.  Druids and Shamans will always be better then we are, and rightly so.  Waiting till 57 for Sup Heal is just to big of a gap in levels.  I have it now and I can never play primary healer, I just don’t have the mana pool for it.  Change Sup heal to lvl 54 and put Celestial Healing at lvl 57. If that spell is to efficient, up the mana cost some and call it something different.  This at least will give us another tool in which to help the healing classes. <P>Increase wave of healing to 300 pnts.  This would be like a group greater heal (lvl 39 spell).  We will be limited on the number of recasts due to the fact paladins do not have enough mana for doing many repeat casts.<P>Change our Divine Strength to stack with ALL other buffs.  If needed make it cost a jasper or even a pearl.  At very least make it worth casting versus the other classes spells.  If a lvl 50 can cast something better what’s the point of using our spell?<P>How about change Flame of Light spell which is an offensive 125 pnt spell to a defensive type shield spell that stacks with other shield spells (similar to wizards new shield spell).  Make it self only but give it a good about of damage say 10 pnts.  This is along the lines of our defensive ability.<P>Divine favor needs changing.  150 pnt rune type spell isn’t worth keeping up all the time with such long recast.  Double the amount of damage it absorbs and increase mana if needed but leave it quick cast time and long recast time.<P>Last but not least get the epic quest items off the dragons.  With the major mistake of making naggy and vox lvl 53- only, you have made it almost impossible for a level 53 + to get their weapon if the need a dragon run item. It makes NO sense that under lvl 53 characters have a much easier time getting their epic weapons then a lvl 60!  <P>Your solution of putting the items on the Kunark dragon would have worked but you made them TO HARD.  Not only do we have to find the dragons up, but we have to defeat their AOE fear and offensive spells.  This takes every piece of resist gear you can wear and also as high of level people as you can get.  <P>So now you have made dragons that you need 58+ with the best gear to fight.  On top of all that you need 50 people to kill them!  So if you’re a character between 53 and 58 your are SOL.  You have a better chance begging like a newbee in freeport to get your item then earning it yourself!<P>You have options to fix this.  1) Move the items off the dragons and make them quests 2) change naggy and vox back and limit the effectiveness of 53+ people on those 2 dragons 3) Debuff the Kunark dragons so that 4 or 5 groups of 53+ can actually have a chance at killing them!!  <P>Paladins should be very strong in defense.  We are a utility and backup class and our spells and abilities should be geared for that purpose. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OMG!  It's a conspiracy!<P>Did you all see the lengths of the previous posts?  Tons of long posts, way longer than any other class I've seen.  I think it's evidence that much needs to be done.<P>It's a shame much of it is lost, but I'm sure new posters will fill in the gaps.<P>As for my comments, I think paladins need much better 1hs and shields (like 75 AC), since that is the class-defining trait of weapon selection.<P>Shields should give MUCH better AC than what is available.  Think about it.  Give up the ability to attack with 2 hands...it shouldn't be an little AC increase, it should be a HUGE AC increase.  Anyone see Gladiator lately?  Roman phlanxes with shields and spears?  HUGE AC<P>Defensive capabilities should be at least equal to warriors.<P>Damage output has to be increased.  The misses are way out of proportion to other classes.  Doing 60% of damage of warriors is woefully inadequate--80% would be more reasonable, considering how useless most spells are.  There's no way having cleric spells from 20 levels lower equates to the 40% (or even my suggested improved 20%) damage reduction.  What is balance is this comparison isn't made?<P>New paladin-only spells should be created, perhaps self-only AC buffs.  I think part of the paladin's problem is that it's spells are low level versions of what clerics got 20 levels ago.  This make no sense.  The spells should have been unique, so as to not infringe on the cleric's capabilities and useful for the levels in which they're used.  This can only be attained by unique spells.<P>Lay hands should heal more.  This is class defining, yet for some reason it's usefulness is being held back.  Class defining, usable only once per day, and heals less than a 39th level cleric spell that can be recast over and over.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hello Absor!<P>Thanks for checking in with us Paladins.<P>Well on to the Matter at hand. I think paladins are mostly fine. We do have 3 issues though at high level play.<P>First I need something to justify my lag on a raid. I'll leave what ever that is up to you, your the game experts. I just play.<P>Second I need something to get away for the Clerics shadow. Although maybe with the improvemnts to the secondary classes some higher level groups will not have a cleric all the time, still 95% of the time I suspect we will. I'd like to be usefull even when we have one.<P>Third, I realize our epic weapon should be hard to get and I'm willing to put in the time. I just don't see why my chances for getting it are so much better at 52, than it is for me at 55.<P>Well anyway thanks for your time.<P>Hawktel Stonesoul<BR>Prexus<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm somewhat reluctant to do this, but since that last thread was corrupted (Innoruuk strikes again, I'm sure!)...<P>What is a Paladin?<BR>In terms of Game mechanics, we're "Defensive Tanks". In literature and history, we're the defenders of the weak and innocent; the knights in shining armour who save the day, who persevere despite all odds. Lancelot. Roland. Joan of Arc.<P>The problem is to allow Paladins to fulfill that role, without intruding to far into the realm of those classes that we draw much of our abilities from. How can this be accomplished? At this point, we have spells drawn from the Cleric class, making us the equal of a Cleric much lower than our own level. Spellcasting is not our primary function, so this is appropriate. As fighters, we have some of the abilities of the Warrior, but Match them in no way (the changes on Test not withstanding). We also have our own special ability, granted by our diety- Lay on Hands.<P>In spite of what we have, we do nothing particularly well. As levels progress, soloing becomes less of an option, yet our appeal to groups becomes equally limited. If there's no Cleric around, then a Paladin might "pinch-hit", provided there's another tank in the group... and provided the opposition isn't too rough. We can fill in for the a Warrior... provided we aren't the main source of melee damage.<P>How do we fix the Paladin? First of all, let's dispense with the notion of "Parent Classes". This terms does more to hurt Paladins, Rangers and Shadowknights than any other notion in the game. Yes, we all draw abilities from other classes... but so too do all the other classes- anyone can melee to some degree, even if they would be foolish to do so. Does that make the Warrior a parent class to all?<P>The Paladin needs changes that are in keeping with the role it plays, both in terms of mechanics and "atmosphere". Here is what I suggest:<P>1) An increase, across the board, in Taunt (this is to all Taunt-capable classes). Give the Warriors a sizeable boost, and a scaled boost to the other classes with the skill. This will help keep "weaker" (in terms of AC and HP) party members alive longer.<P>2) Implement the defense changes now on the Test server, allowing Paladins to match a Warrior's base defense. Thus, under normal conditions, we will be able to stand in the face of danger just as long.<P>3) Lift the cap on Paladin's Bash skill. We of all classes are most likely to use a shield- it is a defining characteristic in many ways. Let us keep it effective. The damage resulting is minimal, but the taunt effect is important to our role.<P>4) Increase our 1HS caps. Frankly, I do not wish to do as much damage as a Warrior (mainly to keep them happy, I'll admit), but I'd like to at least hit the target more frequently. If it is possible to increase our hit frequency without increasing the damage per hit, I would be happy. The again will increase the effectiveness of our taunting. Focus new Paladin weapons on 1HS.<P>5) Give us some unique, Paladin-only abilities or spells, in keeping with our role. An AE protection spell or ability, that lasts until those under the protection attack would fit us perfectly.<P>6) Don't give us any more "hand-me-down" abilities. In most cases, the spells we have received to date are really only useful if we are soloing (not likely!), travelling through dangerous areas, or in a group with no Druid, Cleric or Shaman of roughly equal level. The heals we have are fine for "topping up" between fights, to ease the burden on the Clerics.<P>Some additional words about weapons: Each of the melee classes has a distinct style- Rangers, having Dual Wield, often opt for two fast weapons in place of a single, two handed one. Warriors, having access to some great weapons, are equally comfortable with either, though many prefer the use a single, two-handed weapon to inflict maximum damage. Paladins are blessed with the ability to use a shield and a one-handed weapon, yes are often forced to resort to two-handed ones in order to remain effective. This is due to a combination of (a) the low skill cap on Bash, and (b) the relative scarcity of good 1HS weapons for our class. Even the majority of our holy swords are two handed (why, I'll never know). This, for me, is the greatest issue I have with the class. I don't play a Paladin to be the absolute, undisputed ruler of the battlefield, I play a Paladin because of what the class *is* (and not in terms of mechanics).<P>Tamarrion Barithsdotter<BR>Knight of Truth<BR>Paladin of Mithaniel Marr<BR>Champions of Norrath<BR>The Rathe<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Remf wrote:<P>&gt;”Guess this is the appropriate place to mention it; the defense cap seems too high (i.e. unbalanced).”&lt;<P>I don’t agree at all.  The only thing that the paladin has defensively that equals a warrior is the defense cap.  Warriors have better armor, skills (like parry and riposte), and hit points.  There is no doubt in my mind that a warrior will still be better defensively than a paladin after these changes.<P>Kalorad Valrexxaeus wrote:<P>&gt;”1) We need a useful, big encounter, uber-mob purpose. We have none at the moment. My preference would be a defensive discipline such as riposte. We are by definition defensive tanks. Give us this ability.”&lt;<P>I know that just a few lines up I said that paladins, even with the defense cap increase present on Test, are not the equal of warriors defensively, I am also not certain that they need any other defensive power.  I’ll add this item to the list.  But I am also going to suggest that we make no further changes in this area for a while, until we get  a chance to see what affect the current improvements have.<P>&gt;”2) Fix the level 60 Divine Strength buff, our ONLY useful high level buff, to stack with the level 50 Ranger buff. We need ONE good buff that makes us needed and makes us unique in that no other class has it. It has to stack with everything.”&lt;<P>Well, I disagree.  The stacking of this spell is going to have to be kept in line with the other spells.  Making it stack with everything just to make it ‘special’ for paladins isn’t a good reason.<P>&gt;”3) We need the ability to Stun high level mobs. We are the masters at stuns. No mobs above level 55 or 56 are stunable, i.e., the message says they are stunned but they do not stop beating on anyone, nor do they stop their spell casting.”&lt;<P>I can add this to the list.  Perhaps allowing more creatures to be stunned would help a few other classes at the higher levels, without being to unbalancing.<P>&gt;”4) Raise our BASH skill. Also a disc to make BASH an unresistable stun IF it lands, i.e., to interrupt caster mobs, is highly needed.”&lt;<P>I’m thinking that adding more disciplines isn’t a great idea.  I’m reluctant to start stuffing in disciplines to fix things.  But I’ll add it to the list, assuming that we do not do something like your number 3.<P>&gt;”5) Reduce the reuse time of LOH post level 50. Make it gradually less until level 60. Make it a Complete Heal at level 60.”&lt;<P>No.  Look, LoH is good as it is.  Perhaps an increase in its healing power is in order.  But reducing the reuse time isn’t appropriate (it’s kind of the basis power for recast times), and Complete Heal is out of the question.  I’ll add a suggestion for an increase in the healing power of LoH, but I think it’s fine as is.<P>&gt;”6) Add Yaulp IV to our spells at level 59.”&lt;<P>Hmmm...  I’ll add it.  But there is probably a reason it wasn’t added with the last changes.<P>&gt;”7) Raise our TAUNT skill. Again, we are defensive tanks. It is currently too hard to taunt mobs off of classes which deal much more damage than us.”&lt;<P>Every fighting class seems to want a better ability to taunt.  Folks, taunt is a group thing, not an individual thing.  Your group needs to be controlling their aggro.  And we just can’t be setting it up so that any character can flip a switch to gain the attention of their enemy.<P>Again, I’ll add it to the list.  But we’ll certainly have to look at this is relationship to everything else.<P>&gt;”Where do i begin. Lets start with the appearance no offense but pally's dont look "epic" with just a hilt. The proc rate is for some reason lower than before and i have even saw procs as low as 1 and 2 damage. Something needs to be done.“&lt;<P>The hilt thing is already on the programmer’s to-do list.  I’ll add it to this list too.<P>I don’t think we’ve changed the actual proc rate of the weapon.<P>I’ll ask that someone look at the damage on this item.  I’ll also add to the list of a suggestion that perhaps we change this effect to something defensive.<P>Scrith wrote:<P>&gt;”- raise the Paladin (and SK) Bash skill cap as high as Warriors. Rangers are as good at Archery as Warriors, why shouldn't Paladins be as good at Bashing? You can even argue that they should be better, since Paladins use shield MUCH more often than Warriors (unlike Archery, which is used by both Rangers and Warriors, yet they share the same skill).”&lt;<P>Not better than warriors...  but I can add that it be raised to match a warrior.<P>&gt;”- give Paladins special shields which PROC something. Much like there are Ranger bows that proc when they hit, why not give Paladins shields that can proc? <BR>- give Paladins critical hits on Bash. Rangers have it on Archery, how about finally giving Paladins (and SKs) a chance to get critical hits by putting them on our Bash skill? <BR>- increase the likelihood of Bash stunning high level mobs. One of the biggest problems facing high-level Paladins (lvl 55+) is that our beloved Bash skill, which we have used and depended on so much since our earliest days, is no longer effective against high level mobs. <BR>- please increase the AC on our shields...many of us are still using the same AC 25 shields we had before Kunark was released. Why have weapons (and armor) improved so dramatically since then, yet shields are still providing about the same AC? <BR>- how about a new skill, called Blocking? When using a shield, it gives you a chance of blocking an opponent's attack (much like parry and dodge work). This would give Paladins (and SKs) a unique defensive skill that relies upon their role as shield-bearer.”&lt;<P>In fact, most of this is similar to what shadow knights suggested.  It certainly makes sense to suggest that these two classes have the same sort of skills.<P>ebob said:<P>&gt;”One thing that concerns me is the recast times on certian spells. The one that I've had experiance with is Wave of Healing, our Level 55 Group heal spell. Why is the recast time on this spell 1 minute? I would see the reasoning behind a 1 minute cast time if the spell were to heal more than 200hp, but at 55, 200hp is 1-2 rounds of combat from any mob. I belive that this spell should have its recast time significantly reduced, or the amount of the heal increased.”&lt;<P>I can add it to the list.<P>&gt;”Another thing that is of concern is the new 'Celestial Clensing' spell. Do you realize that it is a worse healing spell than Superior heal, with a higher recast time? The only advantage the spell has over Superior healing is that the first 110 hp will happen a few seconds sooner than the Superior heal will land. The added 30 second recast time just makes it even less useful. This spell should either cost very little mana, or heal for quite a few more ticks.”&lt;<P>I can also add this to the list.  But keep in mind we have a delicate balance to maintain here.  We are already planning to look at upgrades for the two secondary healers.  Too many healers will really impede the viability of clerics.<P>Vikki-the-Valorous wrote:<P>&gt;”This is kind of a suggestion for all classes, not just Paladins. It involves 2 handed weapons. Now over the last few monthes or so you guys have been attempting to make 2h weapons more viable by giving weapons above 40 delay (rarely is there a worthwhile 1h weapon with above 40 delay) a higher damage cap. <BR>My suggestion is instead of raising the maximum damage we can do, raise the minimum. The best idea I can think of at this time would be for the minimum slash/crush/pierce you could do with a 2h weapon would be the base damage of the weapon. For Example: Take a Razing Sword of Skarlon... 25 damage 40 delay... my Paladin has this ( not as my main weapon, but this is for example) and on average I do about 50ish damage a swing (not counting misses). But every once in awhile I'll swing for 16 or so damage.”&lt;<P>Seems like a good idea to me.<P>&gt;”And, while not on the topic of balance, the Velious spell, Flame of Light, has no particle effect. You just pretty much make the movements like you're casting the spell, but no particle effect.”&lt;<P>Noted.<P>Seanen wrote:<P>&gt;”1) Defensive discipline, of course”&lt;<P>Ok, I’ll add it to the list.  Perhaps to replace Holy Forge (and with the suggestion that, perhaps, we might just allow paladins to get crits on undead naturally...).<P>Eliakim wrote:<P>&gt;"2) Disciplines - this topic will be covered many times in this thread by more knowledgable paladins so I won't say much other than paladins need a way to survive and contribute against uber mobs like Venthril Sathir, Trak, Kunark dragons, and the Velious boss mobs. Right now there's no real reason to have a paladin along on the raid. I advocate a shield block discipline equivalent to the Ranger parry discipline. The paladin would have to equip a shield to make it work."&lt;<P>Noted.<P>TexasRanger said:<P>&gt;"1.) More 1HB/1HS and shield options. Many of our signature weapons, like the Messenger of the Queen, Soulfure, Firey Avenger, and Firey Defender are all 2 handers. If we are to be defensive hybrids, where are our shields? Why are so may Paladin only weapons 2 handers?"&lt;<P>I've been thinking about this.  I think what we need to do is determine who will primarily use what weapon combo, and lead them that way (by no means forcing them into those roles).  I see that there are really three types of weapon combos, 2-handed, 1-handed and shield, and two weapons.  Off the top of my head, I'd say 2-handers for shadow knights, weapon and shield for paladins, two weapons for warriors and bards…<P>In any case, this is probably something we should settle on and keep in mind for the future.  It seems unlikely that we would actually change the Fiery Defender into some new weapon and shield combo at this point.  But perhaps we can set some guidelines for the future.<P>Deringer wrote:<P>&gt;" 1. Celestial Level 59 improvement on Test is inconsequential: It has been shown that Superior Healing is better for less mana in every situation unless one where 110 hp before 4.5 seconds is necessary, in which case Divine Favor covers this. Celestial Line is supposed to be more mana efficient because of its over-time effect, yet this spell is LESS mana efficient than Superior Healing. Like every other Paladin spell, it has stacking issues. You do not need to nerf its hitpoints healed AS WELL AS its mana cost. Please reevaluate this spell, it is, in its current form, almost wholly useless, and at Level 59, laughable. <BR>2. Divine Strength Spell is ARGUABLY not as good as storebought level 51 Ranger spell and DOES NOT stack. Make the Level 53 Paladin version 150 HP and the Level 60 version 300 HP, OR make them stack. Currently, this is a huge problem."&lt;<P>Ok, I'll add a request to either increase the healing or reduce the mana on the new Celestial and to look at the stacking of Divine Strength.<P>Kithain wrote:<P>&gt;"A larg enumber of people who play paladins want to play the perfectly noble and good knight. I know the erudites have a quest that involves them slaying a bridge builder (a quest better for an honorable rogue maybe) but ghoulbane is such an important weapon (leads to the epic) that it is really dificult for a Paladin to get one. In a game setting of high fantasy one should be allowed to play a purely good character who will not stain thier honor. If this was a White Wolf game of vampire with all its angst this quest would make more sense."&lt;<P>We could probably argue for pages about this…  I could tell you that an honorable paladin would have absolutely no concern for gaining a weapon, especially if he was taking it from another noble creature…<P>But we won't do that.<P>&gt;"- Divine Glory (100hp buff at level 53). Grossly underpowered. Please consider that Rangers get Strength of Nature at level 51, which adds not only 75hp but an amazing 25 ATK, making it one of the best offensive buffs in the game. To be comparable in utility, you'd have to make Divine Glory about 200hp and 10ac, I think."&lt;<P>Noted.<P>-Kleitus- wrote:<P>&gt;"- Double check that our piercing skill is capped at the same level as our other weapon skills. If you're going to give us lances and spear based polearms then you should allow us to have the same skill caps or just forget about giving us the weapons. Lower skill caps in piercing would make the weapons less attractive for us in the end, especially with our lower skill caps in offense and weapon skills compared to other classes."&lt;<P>I'm not sure that I agree.  But you've also reminded me that there is a fourth weapon combo (from my list above).  I'll have to add it in.  And raising the skill cap will be on my list, though I'd prefer that we just added a new skill for 2-handed piercing…<P>&gt;"- Lull line: look at the resist rates + add a failure message maybe even a message about it wearing off."&lt;<P>This has been noted with other classes, but I'll add it here too.<P>Amith wrote:<P>&gt;"1&gt; Add store bought Lances so we can practice our piercing skill before reaching 40+ level."&lt;<P>Good idea.<P>&gt;"And lastly please please add WHITE armour or simply add a SirCoat (white robe - with Breatplate like stats) for paladins and a nice shield with a paladin-like image. Just like the cover of every EverQuest game box shows."&lt;<P>This is also a good idea.<P>replay-SS wrote:<P>&gt;"Although there is disagreement among the Paladin community on exactly what our Raid-Worthy discipline should be, the general consensus is that it should either be on par with /DEFENSIVE (this would be the most highly desired), /RIPOSTE, or /WEAPONSHIELD (similar to /DEFTTONE)."&lt;<P>I would very much disagree with any sort of riposte-based discipline.

Deepwater armor, our effects are just plain nasty, heh, most paladins say that there must have been no though put into these, they are overall worthless.

I would like to see dodge/parry/riposte caps raised to warrior level or at least closer to them. If rangers have the same cap on offense as warriors then I believe paladins should have those 3 caps raised in addition to defense being capped."&lt;<P>I'll add these to the list.<P>Guardian334 wrote:<P>&gt;"Skills/Abilities <BR>1) Defense Skill to 252 (matching Warriors, up from 225). This narrows the AC gap between hybrid and parent class.<BR>2) Addition of Block Skill when a Shield is equipped (don?t know if this is possible to code, and seems too powerful to simply give the skill to the character if it can be used with a 2hS equipped). Block would be another defensive check the same as Parry, Dodge and Ripsote.<BR>3) Failing the implementation of #2, raise other defensive skills as follows: Dodge 165 (10 under Warriors from 155), Parry 220 (10 under Warriors from 205).<BR>4) Implement Critical/Crippling hits against Undead for Paladins. Warrior (parent class) crit against everything in melee. Rangers crit with archery. Implementing partial criticals makes sense with the parent/hybrid line of thought, and makes Paladins more fun to play.<BR>5) Scale the Lay On Hands recycle timer based on level. Currently it?s 72 minutes per reset. Other disciplines scale down in time based on level, so this is not a request without precedent. I wouldn?t think a recycle time of between 30-40 minutes at level 55+ would be too much, and a scaling formula can be worked out between the current and the new once the team decides on a number.<BR>6) Bash to 240-252 (0 to 12 over Warriors from 200). Paladins and SKs are the only two melee classes that use shields the majority of the time; so much so tank looking types with shields are automatically assumed to be a hybrid since ?real? tanks don?t use them. Clerics, Shamans and/or Druids sometimes use shields, but also sometimes use books or other items in the off hand. A maxed Bash skill makes sense for Paladins.<BR>7) Disarm and Archery; both skills cap low enough to make them effectively useless. Assuming they are intended to do more than take up hot key slots and be a useful pulling tool, they should be raised to levels where they have more than a remote chance of being useful. Somewhere between 70/75 and the mid-upper 100s there?s a happy ground, I?m sure.<BR>8) Add the Evasive Discipline at level 56, the Defensive Discipline at 60. Both should have 2/3rds the effects they do for Warriors (2/3rds of the missed/damage down percentage, 2/3rds duration); keep reset timers the same as for Warriors. <BR>Spells<BR>1) Move the Armor line down: Guard to 39, Armor of Faith to 49.<BR>2) Move the Yaulp line down: Yaulp II to 30, Yaulp III to 39, Yaulp IV to 49.<BR>3) Move Superior Healing from 57 to 53-54. Reduce fizzle rate in line with other previously noted comments on SH fizzles.<BR>4) Add Remedy at 57-58.<BR>5) Move Revive to 39, Resuscitate to 49, Resurrection to 56, Reviviscence to 59. The reason?s pretty basic. Travel spells are shared by two classes (Wizards and Druids). Damage Shields are shared by two classes (Druids and Mages). Primary Pets are shared by two classes (Mages and Necromancers). Speed spells (SoW) are shared by two classes (Druids and Shamans). All the ?market spells? are available from at least two separate class sources, those spells which are generally being sought after. Except Resurrections (specifically what people want when they want a Res, which is some of their lost time back in the form of returned death XP); Clerics are always preferred since they have the highest Res. Doubly so since 59+ Paladins are in such short supply. Granting the hybrid this ability of the parent (Cleric) would not impact the parent?s tactical abilities, only the support slot. And it brings parity to the market of spells we all eternally have varying needs for as we play the game. I haven't met a cleric yet that'd object to help in taking care of the eternal cries for 'Can anyone XP Rez?'<BR>6) Change Divine Strength to a 300-350 HP buff (up from 200). Create a 200-215 HP version and place at level 55. Create a 100-105 HP version and place at level 50.<BR>7) Addendum to #6 above, also add a Regeneration effect to the Divine Strength line. 3HP/Tick at 50, 5HP/Tick at 55, 7HP/Tick at 60. Maintain stacking with all current spells, including Natureskin, Divine Purpose, and druidic/shamanic Regeneration lines. <BR>Equipment:<BR>1) Add a ?Lichbane? 45-50+ version of Ghoulbane, appropriate for the level range it would be used in. Basically, an upgraded version of the popular mid level Paladin sword. The post that mentioned this idea and suggested it be yielded by questing to turn in Ghoulbane and Soulfire was a good way to go about it. If the ?sub-quest? to upgrade the sword idea could be implemented as well (where you do a quest for each temple in Norrath and get slight upgrades to your Lichbane, that?s a great idea that would end up with a final version Lichbane perhaps 10-15% better than the unquested version).<BR>2) Implement additional Shields in game to address the rather sparse shield choices available to Paladins and Shadowknights who, again, are the only tanks using them. Between four and eight new shields would be excellent, with one to three of them coming in at or over 30 AC. Some of the new shields should be questable, some should be drop; hopefully there will be a division in the method used to introduce them into the game. Hopefully at least two or three of them will have useful and functional effects to consider as well.<BR>3) Examine the class-specific weapons available in the game and note the numbers. Paladins are lacking in class-specific (1hS and 1hB especially) weapons compared to options available to other tank classes. A little on the quality side, but mostly on the availability side of the question. Broader selection would really help shake out the equipment options for the bulk of the Paladin class population.<BR>4) Reexamine the Paladin Epic; is it comparable to other tank epic weapons? Why is it 2hS when many Paladins are using shields? Various suggestions already made adding additional quests that can be done to transfer a 2hS major quest or epic Paladin weapon into a sword/shield combo would be great additions after balance issues with the current offering are considered. <BR>Combat Problems:<BR>1) Unstunnable mobs are a real brick wall for Paladins. The Stun line is our single most combat effective line, the one that gives us the most mileage. Mobs where stuns are meaningless render a decent chunk of a Paladin?s combat effectiveness useless. Some encounters should be retained unstunnable for encounter/world balance reasons; others are perhaps able to be tuned down to keep Paladins in the game in these situations. Speaking personally, fighting mobs that cast but are unstunnable and uninterruptible generate intense feelings of hopelessness. To make an encounter difficult and require challenging use of skill is one thing; to make an encounter unalterable through any means is another.<BR>Put another way; sometimes it?s good that you know the mob will get the complete heal off anyway. Other times, it just leaves you feeling useless at your inability to have any chance of doing something to counter that which is leading to your downfall.<BR>2) The proposed spell on Test, Celestial Cleansing (110hp heal-over-time for four ticks, totaling 440hps healing at the end of the spell, with an additional tick waited before recasting) is a great way to let a Paladin heal while still staying engaged in the fight (skip a melee round to get the heal off on your fellow, then start swinging again the next while the healing kicks in). The problem are the numbers involved. At 59 mobs double for 110 on a really, really bad roll. The well documented severity of Velious raid-level encounters should adequately showcase the disparity between Test?s Celestial Cleansing and the amount of damage it?s being called upon to heal. The spell idea is solid however, if implemented in two or three versions and spread across the spell options for the Paladin. Move Celestial Cleansing to 50 or 51, where it can make a more measurable impact. Put in a 170-200hp/tick version at about 55, and a 225-300hp/tick version at about 60. The Mana/HP efficiency should be very comparable to that of ?normal? heals, as you?re trading away time to get more HPs later, and that should be a tradeoff respected in the costs associated with the spell."&lt;<P>Ok, I know that was a long quote, sorry.  I'm using these replies as the basis for building my lists, so I just decided to use this whole thing.  You've duplicated things that we've covered and all that, but it seems like a solid list.<P>I'm also kind of interested in the idea of a discipline that would allow the LoH ability to work on the whole group.  It's interesting.  Probably not going to happen, but it's still interesting.<P>Iustus wrote:<P>&gt;"(5) Add a new quest which permenantly changes the paladin and SK epics into 1h weapons. These classes want a 1h weapon so they can equip a shield."&lt;<P>That's an interesting solution.<P>Mythral-CN wrote:<P>&gt;"LVL 55 - PALADIN<BR>Sanctification : Makes a paladin immune from ALL types of spell attacks for a duration of 20 secs.

Discipline/spells/ability for major raids and Mob-Boss.<BR>2. Serious Upgrade to Bash/Stun ability on 50+ lvl mobs. (Make people want to carry shields instead of duel-wielding or 2handed weapon use.)<BR>3. A larger selection of Shields (w/proc) and 1 handed weapons.<BR>4. Our lack of ability to be Masters of undead fighting at any level.<BR>5. Serious Upgrades to Defensive/taunt/ low skill levels.<BR>6. Super low Epic quest book drops from dragons, and level cap on Nag/Vox. Epic quest should be a 1hand sword and shield combo.<BR>7. Redo our Spell line, to give us more buffs, that a group needs. Move Yaulp to paladins at a earlier level. (basically switch the lines so Cleric get them after we do)<BR>8. Low drop rate of our Armour on RoK, Fear, SoV, and serious lack of good AC (with Paladin helpful spells and stats) items.<BR>9. Serious upgrade on our offensive skill levels, past 50 we miss way too much. <BR>10. Horses or some other type of pet. (I personally don’t care for this idea)<P>What I would personally like to see is White armour and a nice paladin like shield, (come on what paladins wants to carry a Crested MistMorre shield, with its skull pix??) If you can’t give us White armour, please add SirCoats into the game, White Mage-like robes with paladin like pixs on the chest.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I have seen this topic many times throughout this discussion, so I'll make this fairly brief, however I feel this issue is important enough to add another post to it, and make it a post completely devoted to this one issue instead of having this issue lost in a series of other ideas. <P>It has already been said several times that paladins are generally balanced up to 50, and major problems occur at 55+, and especially up at 60.  At these higher lvls, raids of high lvl zones, epic quest ventures, and slaying of dragons are among the funnest thing to do, they are essentially some of the only things that give a sense of "completing" the never ending world of Norrath.  To have played the game for so long and be able to finally go explore the greatest wonders and areas of Norrath is a great feeling of accomplishment to a player.  <P>It is for that reason that I feel the largest issue for balancing paladins is the fact of their desirability on these raids.  What good it is to have played the game for so long if you are not wanted to go participate in some of EverQuest's funnest and most challenging situations?  Currently paladins serve no real purpose on raids.  Their mix of a healer/tank can be helpful in the lower lvls.  However, in a situation where there will most always be clerics and warriors about, aka large raids, their usefulness almost evaporates.  A paladin cannot compare to the healing/buffing capability of a cleric, come no where close to the dmg output of a warrior, and are sometimes even discouraged from even taunting because it is more mana efficient for the cleric to simply heal the warrior. What this results in is that a paladin is basically just a small addition of melee damage on an epic raid, since his other abilities are better fulfilled by other classses.<P>The fix to this issue is a complicated one.  Many of the enhancements and ideas here are good, and will bring the paladin closer to being desired on a raid.  However I believe that what is needed most for this issue is distinctness.  Paladins need some type of ability or spell that NO ONE ELSE HAS, that will stack with everything (if a spell), and is desired on large raids.  Giving paladins just one ability that has true usefulness to players in a raid, and that no one else can perform, would let paladins actually be desired and sought after for these high lvl events.<P>What this ability should be I leave to others to figure out.  A unique, effective Disc, or letting paladins Stun their high lvl foes are both good ideas.  I personally like the idea of letting paladins stun, since this is an ability they already have and would simply mean letting it actually work, even if less effictivly, on high lvl mobs.  LoH could really only be considered useful on these raids if it had a significantly lower casting time, as a cleric can complete heal from his BP.  Making paladins specialized in undead could also help, however it would require that the mobs being fought were undead, which is not always the case.  A small side note here, I personally think that undead dragons would be a nice addition to the high lvl zones of Norrath  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  I'd like to thank verant again for this opportunity to the players.

If I target a npc Loh is gone if I target a corps LoH is gone if I target the boat LoH is gone. Is there a way you can make it were LoH can only be used on people who are alive and if you target something like a boat, npc, or a corpse have it give invalid target message so that we wont lose our LoH.

</FONT><HR>OK my take on this;<P>   Improving our defense skill will not help all that much, we need to avoid the 400 point hits instead. Since we are the defensive hybrid let us be more defensive please. Raise our parry,dodge and riposte skills; as well as our bash. Between the Shadow Knights and Paladins we are the only ones who use shields to bash. How about increasing the damage and maybe throw us a bone via critical hits with a shield bash. <BR>   Also, since Paladins are out there to destroy evil and undead how about criticals against undead (like warriors) without using a discipline. Say around level 20 when we get our name. If you need to change the discipline make it do auto crits for 10 or 15 secs.<BR>   I think Sup. Healing should be moved down some, maybe level 54. Some defensive discplines for raids would be nice, our main contributions to fights are our stuns but a 55+ mob ignores our stuns. With our pitiful damage, no stuns, and no defensive disciplines, it's no wonder we are rarely called upon to do major raids (ie epics).<BR>   Some more nice one handers like Sword of Mourning would be nice, nice one handers are rare and for paladins even more rare. I see a paladin as a shield and one handed weapon knight but you all seem to force us down the two handed path if we want to do any sort of damage. The Shadow Knights have a very nice Ebon Mace, the shame is that Paladins do not have something even remotely (not even in the same ball park) similar. Closest one handed weapon would be the Halycon Broadsword, and its not that close really.<BR>   Lastly can you please check the book drops there are more and more Paladins in the 50+ range and the books "seem" to be not dropping. Speaking of the Quest weapon it seems abit odd in order to get our (granted I'm not in an uberguild so will never see it) Fiery Defender, we have to do the Quest for Soulfire, than do the Quest for the Fiery Avenger (which is a major pain without the book drops, than lastly do the Fiery Defender. Our reward for all this is disappointing, but since I'll never see it I won't hold much hope for a change. How about a quest for a one hander (that you don't have to go to a plane).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Alright. Since I do not know if my previous message was read, I shall attempt to repeat my points here.<P>I have about 240 DAYS PLAYED on my paladin, and I think I know the class as well as anyone.<P>Let us start with the most important item. It is my belief that Verant would like for Paladins and SKs to be alternative tanks to warriors, inferior, but a very viable choice for that role. Kunark started the process of eliminating the viablity of these hybrids to fill the tank roll and Velious cemented it. As far as I can tell, ALL of the big velious encounters were tuned assuming the person tanking the mob had defensive discipline (and with a cleric castig complete heal for that matter).<P>(1)Give paladins and SKs the defensive discipline. <BR>-------------------------------------------------<BR>Nothing short of this will allow these hyrbids to serve as viable replacement tanks to warriors. No single class should be completely irreplaceable in every encounter, as warriors are today. I think it is important to make this discipline be a 10 minute cycle with a 3 minute duration at level 60 (same as warriors), although giving it to the hybrids later in life (say 59 or 60) would make sense, since it is really only the lvl 58+ game which is so out of wack. <P>I would trade ALL the changes on test for this one thing in a heartbeat. This change ALONE would allow these classes at least a smidget of respect on raids.<P>To the warriors who might feel threatened, note that this does nothing to close either the HP or AC gap, nor the gap in damage avoidance skills (dodge, parry, reposte), (all of which frankly I think could be elminated and still retain balence) nor, most importantly, that a warriod does about twice the damage of a paladin or SK.<P>To be fair, some warriors are going to lose something if the hyrbids are made viable tanks. All of the big guilds have some hybrids in them, however few, and if these are made viable as tanks, then the hoards of unguilded warriors who are brought along on raids just because it is warriors that are needed will be reduced. No longer will an inferior warrior be better than the best hybrid. Is this not how it should be?<P>Ok, next point. Just as warriors are an essential class in velious (moreso that enchanters), the other essential class is the cleric. Why? Complete heal. No other healing spell is viable for tanking the big mobs. None. So no other class is acceptable as a healer of warriors. How to address this?<P>(2) Add a 50% heal spell for the other healing classes<BR>---------------------------------------------------------<BR>This spell would heal half of the target's total hps. If the target has 3000hp buffed this spell would heal 1500 hp. If the target has 5000hp, this spell would heal 2500 hp. The cast time and mana cost of this spell would be about the same as complete heal (10 seconds). No cleric would ever use this spell over CH, but you are not giving this spell to clerics. Two druids, shaman, or even paladins would be able to combine their efforts and mana to be the equivalent of one cleric. This would do nothing to endanger the primacy of clerics (why take up 2 groups slots when you only need one for a cleric), but it WOULD allow for two of the other healing classes to fill in for them in a pinch. I'd give this spell to all the classes that get superior heal, at the same level (53, 53, 57).<P>Ok, now on to buff spells. Paladins suffer because their spells just dont stack with cleric spells, so they are usually unwanted. Now at level 60, clerics get a spell called Aegolism, which is one spell which combines the effects of three other spells the cleric can cast: Heroism, Bullwark of Faith, and Symbol of Marzin. The great advantage of this spell is it takes one, not three of the 15 slots for buffs on a person.<P>(3) Give Paladins a new spell at 60, which combines three other spells they already have: Resolution, Shield of Words, and Symbol of Naltron. This spell would be used, especially when there is a lvl 60 paladin, but only lvl 59 or lower clerics. Some people would prefer the three cleric buffs. Others might opt for the single paladin buff, leaving more space for other buffs. This would truely be a big win, and would not change the balence much. <P>Ok, on to the epic.<P>(4) Add a new quest to transform the Paladin and SK epics to 1hs<BR>-----------------------------------------------------------------<BR>There are so many reasons to do this. I'm not asking that the weapon be made to do more damage. Nor really asking it be made faster, in order to taunt more (i've started to like the huge repostes I get). What I want is the ability to equip a shield. To me, and many, the image of a knight is just as much about a shield on one arm as it is with a sword in the other. I'm not in favor of making the epics INCLUDE a shield with the sword (ala the warrior splits), just make it a one way change to a one handed weapon. There are plenty of shields out there I would love to equip. But the sad fact is that these shields go to clerics, druids, and shaman, since with the epics there is no reason for ANY melee class to ever use a shield. (Except perhaps a monk). If it was up to me, I'd keep the stats identical, make the quest a hard one for the 'training' to use our epics with a single hand. Keep their slow speeds, as that is not the problem. If you feel you must reduce the stats, then go ahead. I'm not quite sure I would agree with arguments that are the stats must be reduced because of the additional stats on a shield -- clerics, druids, rogues, monks, wizards, mages, necros, and enchanters all have similar stats and only lose one slot to their epics. Why warriors, SKs, Paladins, and rangers must pay this penalty, I dont know, but frankly I dont think it makes sense at all for the knight classes, who really want to use a shield, given the choice. If anything, perhaps those that need to use two slots for their epics should have higher stats, to compensate for losing both slots (just take an average of what the other classes are putting in those other slots) -- although the ideal solution is to just take 1 slot if feasible.. which i think it IS in the case of Paladins and SKs (but probably not in the case of wariors and Rangers.)<P>The new lvl 59 healing dot spell on test is worthless. I'm not sure healing dot spells in general make sense on a paladin. Lets focus on where their strengths are, lifesaving when immenant death is coming.<P>(5) At level 59, give paladins an upgrade to superior heal. This spell would have a close to 1 second cast time, healing about the same as superior heal. It would be possible to instantly recast it, but with its high mana cost (at least that of superior heal), a paladin would not be able to cast many heals before being oom. Paladins would not be using this for general healing, but it WOULD let them heal in emergencies, long enough for the real healer to finish their complete heal or whatever they were casting. (I'd take this over the 50% heal spell for paladins, letting druids and shaman get that spell, which probably is more appropriate for them)<P>And finally, lets look again at all the defensive skill caps.<P>(6) not only would I raise the defense cap to that of warriors, but also dodge, parry, reposte. Lets face it, with all of the OFFENSE that warriors pack in, making paladins and SKs their defensive equals is not going to endanger their primacy. And we are not even talking about that. Warriors will STILL have superior HPs, armor, and resists.<P>-Iustus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, here is another idea for an item that would make paladins very useful. (Whether it is too much, you judge). How about a right click item that casts Resurrection. This item would only be useable by lvl 59+ paladins. <P>Not a big deal, not really even something that would affect balance one way or the other, but I think it would be a useful item, and I would love to be saved the mana that all my cleric friends dont spend with their click sticks.<P>(I'd trade the resistable proc on our epic for this in a heartblink).<P>-Iustus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One more thought if you are still listening.<P>(7) Make the proc on our epic unresistable, like it was after the first fix.<BR>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>There are PLENTY of non-epic weapons with similar procs which ARE unresistable. The Tranquil staff and Ranger staff that procs Natures Wrath to name a few. These items are not unbalenced. Why should a 155 pt proc ever be resisted on an epic? There are already unstunnable mobs, even if a stun proc lands (see tranq staff), so that cannot be your reason. This really would be a minor change, but it sure would elimnate all the frustration with seeing all those resists.<P>-Iustus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>When I started playing a EQ a year ago a chose to be a paladin for the following reason, which I considered to be class defining:<BR>1.) 2ND best class for absorbing damage<BR>2.) Holy swords<BR>3.) Cleric spells<BR>4.) LOH<BR>5.) Bash/Stun<P>Since the expansions all these attributes have been made less made distinctive for the Paladin class.<BR>I will take them point by point to show what I feel has gone wrong.<P>#1  - 2nd best class for absorbing damage<BR>	This issue seems to already been addressed at least on the test server. Pallys still are the second best at absorbing damage, but the difference between first and second was too great. The expansions gave the mobs to many HP and inflict damage to quickly. Pallys should be a viable option as main tank when a warrior is not available. <P>#2 - Holy Swords<BR>	Paladins are a sword and shield class. We don’t get dual wield, but the trade off, pre-expansion, was some of the best weapons in the game where paladin only. Warriors and rangers would drool over the GB, Soulfire, and FA. The epic FA Holysword was class defining for paladins. Now every class has an epic.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> We went from having the only epic to having one that is a relative pain to get, and not nearly the most powerful. To me this is like giving the other classes besides clerics the Cheal spell. Also we need a post 50 Ghoulbane equivalent. A better 1hs Pally only weapon is needed for mid 50s characters. It should be attainable by a single well-balanced group of the appropriate level, just like the Ghoulbane.  If you do put one in PLEASE make it no drop this time, so it can’t be farmed. <P>#3 - Cleric spells<BR>	Again this seems to be addressed by the changes to test. Post 50 a cleric is pretty much required by a group, which doesn’t give us much of a chance to use our buffs. By making shammies and druids more effective healers there is at least now a chance that we could buff in a pick up group.<P>#4 - LOH<BR>	This should be a complete heal for what ever level the character is period.<P>#5 – Bash/Stun<BR>	Uber mobs resisting bash greatly reduces our effectiveness on big raids. Maybe a bash discipline that made it unresistable for a short time would be possible? If we where able to land a bash on those gating mobs we would defiantly be asked on major raids.<P>	Anyway that is my 2cp. Given how seriously VI is taking these class talks I can’t wait to read the summary for this thread.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Ok First off let me State I have been Playing a Paladin Since Beta 2.  I have more Hours On a Paladin then I can even Remember...<P>I got a lvl 59 Pally on Tm,  and a Lvl 52 on Xev, and let me tell you ...Its been a Love/Hate relationship from that start. <P>Let me just state for the record,  I LOVE being a Paladin. I find I am very useful in a group,  Can help heal some,  can part Mobs etc etc..But this is only while I am in the low 50's,  Soon as I got bigger and started in new places...I would sit for hrs asking for a group,  No one wanted Pals cause of the exp penalty and the fact that we could not tank nearly as well as a warrior. Or I would try to get into a big raid and be told straight out No,  Pals need not apply. You would just be another corpse the clerics would have to rez,  we need a real tank ..etc etc...<P>I have seen tons of chances the pals in the last few years,  some of them good, some of them bad.<BR>New spells, More hps,  Better weapons Armor etc etc.., I sit here and I read tons of msgs from Countless People and most of them Have the same ideas and observations as I do.  Only 1 thing really does Bug me about Pals other then What most have written in the last few msgs about Discipines,  Lowering spell lvls, etc etc..<P>My only complaint that I have not seen on almost all the posts is about gear.<P>Pals and sk's are basicly are the same classes,  1 evil and 1 do gooder...They have different spells and ways of killing stuff..But in general they were made to be basicly the same kinda Class...A Plate wearing Hybrid.<P>They cap at almost all the same lvls in Skills,  have about the same hps Unbuffed etc etc...<P>The thing thats gets me about the 2 is Items...<P>Sk's, Rangers,  bards All have alot more Items they can use then Pals.  Pals can't use piercing...So righ there we really get the short end of the stick...tons of nice piering items out there.   I know you said we would never get piering items,  but even if we can't use them as weapons, Maybe we can use them in ranged slots?<BR>I know quite a few Sk's who use some of them ranged items in ranged slots for add's.  There are quitea few items out there with some nice adds that fit into ranged slots...Maybe it can be coded that pals can use them too. Seems rather unfair that all these weapons out there that sk's can use in ranged slot but pals can't.<P>Also, why is it that pals seem to have the Most race restricted Items?   Erud only Shield from Meastro,  Tunare only sword,  Underfoot sword not usable by Half Elfs just to name a few....Nothing gets me more then not being able to use a Item just cause I like to play a Half elf.<P>I know there are some other classes and races out that can't use items same as my Pal...But from my experience..pals get the worst of it.  <P>Shields are another thing,  So few shields out there for a pal to use...and the one of the Best ones is Erud Pal only,  I mean why would a None Erudite pal even wanna Kill Meastro?  Is not a single item on him him that would be of any good use.  Same with Vox?  What would a pal benefit from killing vox? Just to try and win a book? At least on Naggy you got a chance to win a COF or something.  Need some new shields out there for sure...Make em Pally and Sk only,. Since we are basicly the only Melee class out there that uses Shields on a regular basis.<P>Armor,   See this is another one that gets my boat,  Is some nice armor out there for a pal, but pals always seem to get short changed on items that a Sk and war can use...Why can a sk use certain armor that a pal can't??  Why give Sk's all this good armor and not let a pal use it? Take for instance Incarodine armor...This armor is great set of armor, Yet pals can't wear the chest or legs.  Or the Stonewood mail found in Pog?  Oh yeah and that reminds me....Why dont Pals,  Ranger and Druids have Armor anywhere?  All the other classes get drops in POG?  Why not Pals, Rangers and Druid....Oh and another thing since we on Planes...<P>POF,  You need to make Valor armor drop on Both Male and Female FF's.  Nothing worse then going to POF and seeing all these female spawn with no chance of armor dropping. Meanwhile 6 pieces of sk armor is gotten cause it drops like candy. <BR>I can't even count the amount of Sk's armor i seen drop that just sat there and rotted.<P>Weapons are the same way,  Pally weapons are far and few inbetween. Sk's get some really nice weapons out there with some damn nice stat increases. Or spells on em,  Including all the Piercing items a pal can't use.  You would think we would have more items to use to make up for the 1 less skill tree to choose from. Yet we dont have more...we have less. <P>Ok last bit that irks me...<P>Deepwater armor, <P>Spells....Sheesh,  most of them are useless....If you give us Endure magic like you testing on the Test server..That means we get 1 total spell that is new to our class,  1 spell from legs...All the rest of the armor is spells we have in our spell book. Breastplate spell is a joke too...Symbol spell that still requires a stone to use...meanwhile rangers get gate,  warriors get heal,  rogues get heal etc etc etc....You said ya self that that chest and legs are uber items,  yet you put a better spell on legs then on chest.  Chest spell is horrible.....It should be a spell we dont have in our spell book already,  Its a Uber item...Almost all the other classes have a great spell (Sk is questionable too) Its a uber item so make it worth it.<P>I dont even want to get in to it about the Casting time on bracers,  the uselessness of Soothe...Cancel magic has its uses, Daring has its uses,  Endure magic has its useses (Unless you give us it as a Spell).<P>Oh and 1 more thing,  Why do monks have more weapons then pals too?  We even have to share our baton of faith with monks,  while Rangers and Sk's get thier own 30/40 stat wise weapons.<P>In General,  I would just like to see you be consistant...As it is now,  Sk's get Pet,  more weapons,  more armor,  in general..they get more.<P>Pals and Sk's should be closer in a General sense then this.  Pals should not be inferior to Sk's in all those departments.....Hybrid survive on the gear they own...and pals are getting short changed in this department. Pals used to have the upper hand in this department since was almost no good 1h weapon a Sk could use pre - Kunark...but ever since Kunark and Velious....have been by far a ton more weapons for every other melee class. <BR>Pals need a serious upgrade in Weapons and armor to even come close to what other melee classes have to choose from.<P>Oh well enough from me...Just my 2 cents worth.<P><BR>Great idea's from the rest of ya,  Tons of good ways to help the class and not overpower us.<BR>Keep em coming...<P>           Raynoc LifeGiver<BR>           Lvl 59/52 TM / Xev</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I've been noticing more and more as my character advances (currently lvl 47) that the damage I do as a Palidan is a little more than a few taps here and there. <P>My suggestion to help balance this class a bit more would be to allow a Palidan to land a few more hits by perhaps allowing 1HS/2HS and offence to move a bit higher and faster than the current set limits. I've actually been in many fights with low blue creature and have been nothing more than a good looking statue not landing 1 single hit the entire fight (grouped of course, but with lower lvl players than myself). I'm not suggesting that I should do more damage than a pure warrior by any means, but at the same time it would be nice to be needed in a group for my ability to hit rather than just being there for my LoH when things go wrong and we need a quick get away.<P>Valorus Contego<BR>47 Palidan - Saryrn<P>(Sorry for Dupe post outside this forum.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>repost:<BR>I'll try to make it brief. First, let me thank VI for looking into the issue of game balance, which is a problem that can ruin all the fun of the game for hardcore gamers like me.<BR>Next, all I'm going to say only applies to level 55+ (mostly 60, in fact).<BR>The purpose of this post is informative (for pallies and VI), and it's to compare the defensive abilities of various tank classes. I will however also make some suggestions at the end.<BR>Now you should know that my specialty (in RL as in EQ) is to crunch numbers. I do not believe in vague sentences about how this or that class should be a better thank because of AC, or skills, or whatever else, I only believe in log parsing.<BR>I have therefore parsed about 50 Mb of data collected during raids in PoG. This corresponds to several weeks of intensive PoG farming by my guild, and should lead to extremely small statistical error (about 1%). I collected everyone's hits / tanked hits and did various operations (all of which were meant to help paladins, as you will see):<BR>* did not take into account defensive disc. each time a pure tank would use a disc the data would be discarded for the duration of the disc.<BR>* removed the logs of all bosses. this is because some people (e.g. paladins with their epic) tend to over-aggro for very long periods of time, resulting in severe inbalance of tanking during long fights.<BR>Ok so since this is a talk about class balance I compared 4 classes: warriors, monks, rogues and paladins (I did not have enough data for rangers and SKs, sorry). A first result is the average damage taken by attempted hit by a mob. I only show people for whom I have a very large statistical sample.<BR>(why do i only give results on defensive abilites, btw? because i think our offensive abilities are well documented already -- everyone more or less knows that warriors do 50% more dmg than we do, monks almost 100% and rogues about 150%; so I wont reproduce these numbers here)<BR>anyway here it is:<P>59 pally:    55.6<BR>60 pally:    54.3<BR>60 pally*:  52.3  <BR>60 monk:   50.8<BR>58 rog:       49.9<BR>59 war:       46.9<BR>58 war:       44.6<BR>59 war:       43.4<BR>60 war:       43.3<BR>60 rog*:     43.1<BR>60 monk*: 41.4<P>Note the *'s: this corresponds to my (slightly subjective) notion of people who have "uber" gear. Basically these folks have the best equipment on the server and probably close to the best anyone can reasonably acquire.<BR>The other people all have pretty decent equipment too.<BR>Now what do we see? First we find warriors, monks and rogues who seem to take about the same amount of damage. Since this isn't a post about these classes I won't comment. However, the paladins stand clearly far behind the 3 other classes. Ugh. So the plate armor of paladins doesn't protect them as well as the leather of rogues or the robes of monks. Which means that a cleric healing a paladin (without using Complete Healing) will be basically wasting his mana. Fine. At this point people will probably respond: "yes but they have more HPs". Ok let's take this into account. I asked everyone for their fully buffed HPs and divided it by the average damage taken per hit: that gives you the typical time it will take for a mob to bring you from full health to death. It's also a measure of how mana-efficient CH is on you. Here we go:<P>59 pally:    77.3<BR>60 pally:    81.0<BR>58 rog:       81.1<BR>60 monk:   86.6<BR>60 pally*:  89.6<BR>60 rog*:     97.4  <BR>59 war:       98.1<BR>60 monk*: 99.0<BR>59 war:       101.5<BR>58 war:       115.2<BR>60 war:       115.4<P>Suddenly, everything's changed... not. At least not for pallies. We clearly see warriors' superior HPs making them much better tanks than everyone else. They're undoubtedly by far the most mana-efficients tanks to CH (and remember they also have the best defensive disc). However paladins remain behind everyone else, except our uber-pally who barely outtanks a 58 rogue and a 60 monk. So, that's basically what you paladins out there can hope for if you spend countless hours camping uber-rare items: become as good a tank as a reasonably well equipped monk or rogue (who doesn't use any defensive discs, of course).<P>I said it would be brief so I'll stop now and let you analyze the data for yourself. These are verious serious numbers, I will answer any question about the methodology used. Please feel free to try to do similar tests if you're not convinced, I guarantee you'll find similar results. I will conclude with some suggestions by order of importance:<P>1) defense skills: please upgrade defensive skill caps of paladins. At the moment the paladin class is essentially a broken class at high level since it cannot fulfill what it's supposed to be its role i.e. defensive tank. [the changes on test are a good start] <BR>2) defense discipline: please give us one (not as good as warriors of course and not with 7mns reuse but something). paladins (and SKs) are the only tank/hybrid class that don't have any defensive disc. Even rangers and bards have one. (sanctification cannot be considered a defensive disc since 99.9% of the dmg taken at high level comes from melee).<BR>Btw please feel free to scrap Holyforge if needed...<P>Ok these are the 2 most important things. I also have some unrelated suggestions which I will present anyhow:<P>3) critical bashes, or something else that allows us to interrupt 56+ mobs. One important role of paladins is interrupting casters, which unfortunately disappears at high level due to unstunnable/high MR/uninterruptable mobs.<BR>4) LH should be made a discipline. It should have reduced recast time at higher level. In return I wouldn't mind if it didn't reappear after each death.<BR>5) upgrade shields. Right now there's no good reason for any class to use 1hers and shields at high level. Paladins are traditionally the class that uses shields but there are several 2hers out there which have more AC than any shield...<P>Maybe if some of these suggestions are implemented will we stop seeing uber-guilds with min level requirements of the form: "level 50+ warriors; level 61+ paladins" ...<BR>Thank you.<P>PS: added, quick comment. the new healing spell that was added at level 59 (1) is slower (2) heals less (3) is less mana efficient than sup heal (that we get at level 57). Was it really meant to be so?<P>Kugazson &lt;Valon&gt; Terris-Thule<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055491-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055491.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055491-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055491-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055491-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055491-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055491-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055491&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055491&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
