</FONT><HR>This was the responce I expected as well.<P>Verant loves to nerf classes, and they put in new spells to try to sell thier expansions. Well people bought the expansion already so why add more Illusions?<P>Sure this has been asked for and denied. Verant came up with excuses (reasons, system requirements, gameplay issues, and other names.)<P>But basically it comes down to two things. Verant can easily add in new illusions, they proved it time and time again. Verant doesn't need to add to the enchanter class because people like to play enchanters.<P>They have added masks so that rogues and bards get Illusions, necklasses to give everyone skelly form, and even an item in mismore to make warriors into werewolfs. Why? because they are fun spells. And people play games for fun.<P>So why would they not add in one simple illusion to the enchanters? global models?(no!) system requirements?(no!), fun only?(no!), not any programers capable?(no!).<P>It comes down to money. Verant doesn't need to spend any resourses to make enchanters happy. <P>They just made a bunch of spells that they thought would make enchanters jump for joy.<P>They even are going to add in a Enchant Velium spell as soon as they get all the item stats worked out.<P>They made the new Velious zones more challenging for enchanters by adding high magic resistance. They even put in factions so that players must make choices on what to kill. <P>Sure they gave casting clarity on others to druids, gave Illusions we asked for to necros, and even our copycat spell to mages. But they gave us thier vampiric embrace in boon of garu, and expanded our jewelcraft. <P>Basically I am happy with the way the enchanter class is, and has become. They are one of if not the hardest to play class. They are also one of the most fun and versitile.<P>On a side note, I am mad as hell at the final word from Verant, although I knew it was going to turn out this way.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>Just answer me one question please, will enchanters get post 44 illusions in the next expansion?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Jeese Dead-nameless, that was pathetic! Enchanters have more illusions than ANY other class and rightfully so. BUT there are now a few they don't have. So what! Get over it. VI has said that they may add the gender flip and a few others in the future, but are by no means neccessary. This thread is sickening to see so many penis envy (or spell envy as the case may be)inflicted people in one spot at the same time! <P>Enchanters have a HUGE niche and a great line of spells. They are one of the best and most diverse classes to play. Why is giving druids, shams, and Rangers a little something to brighten their days harmful to you! We should all be praising VI for trying to make the game more than what it currently is, even if we don't all benefit from the changes directly. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Oh dear god.. &lt;laughs&gt;<P>"... no dungeon anywhere would become non-threatening through the use of illusions even combined with Collab."<P>Awww.. you mean you can't walk through a dungeon as though you were walking through Kelethin?  Poor you.. please, accept my condolences and utter, heartfelt sympathies.  Welcome to the same situation the rest of us have always been in.<P>"Then Velious where Verant spited Enchanters by delivering what was our province to others thus dilluting our own class."<P>Oh, god forbid.  I'm sorry, guys, but this whole thread has me close to falling out of my chair laughing.  My primary character is a druid, and I play her damned well.  I never let buffs drop, I do a fair share of damage to mobs, and I've managed (many times, to boot) to keep my groups alive as the *primary* healer in zones like Karnor's and Sebilis.  But without fail, I have to struggle just to get *into* those groups.  Why?  All anyone wants in their groups in high level zones are... you guessed it.  Enchanters, and Clerics.  You got those two, you're all set.. just toss in a couple of tanks, a caster, and *maybe* a druid or shaman, and you're good to go.  We're the unnecessary ones.  We're the ones who feel "neutered."<P>And we are, by no stretch of the imagination, unique.  Ohhh no, you're no longer the only class who can cast an illusion upon yourself.  Know what?  You haven't been for a long time.  Bards and Rogues (if memory serves) can use various items to cast an illusion over themselves.  Druids can go into wolf form.<P>I can't name a single thing that druids can do, that another class can't do too.  Spirit of Wolf?  Shamans.  DoTs?  Shamans, Necros..  Ports?  Wizards.  Wolf form?  Rangers.  Healing?  Clerics, Shamans.  Damage shield?  Mages.   Regen?  Bards.  Snare?  Harmony?  Root?  What makes *us* unique?  Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.<P>So I get a real kick out of coming to the boards and seeing Enchanters, who are one of the two most necessary classes for any groups in high level zones, whining about something like *illusions*, when you've already got so many.  I can't turn into any of the things you can.<BR>Yet there you are, upset because for once, Verant gave an illusion to a class other than yourselves, and you can't do it too.  When do you think Verant will give druids the ability to mez mobs?  Cast Clarity?  Insight?  Not likely.  So let the Necros and Shamans have their Spectre and Bear illusions, respectively.. and remember that you're still one of the most sought-after classes for high level groups in the entire game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello everyone..<BR>     I reallize that I may be way too late on posting but I need to say whats on my mind.  Ive been watching this debate for a little while now and feel that I have a better understanding of both sides.<P>To us enchanters: Druids/Shamans/Mages are not casting illusions.. they are changing form.. yes it looks the same, but it is different.  Please understand that when you are saying blah blah got this blah blah got that.<P>To Absor and Verent:  You are totally right.  The classes that got those shapechanges should keep those shapechanges.  It is part of thier class.  Part of thier Uniqueness.  But you are wrong on one thing.  Look at about 75% of our post 50 names.  Most of them have to do with illusion.  Would it be fair to us for us to be called illusionists at these high levels without having high level illusions?  Another thing you are wrong on.  The other classes unique ability to change form is just that a unique ability to change form, one of the unique abilities of the enchanter is to create an illusion of a form over us to either A) make us more liked in an area or B) create such fear in an opponant that we appear stronger. (sorry thats the only way I could put in the special abbilities we get from the transformations)  What I say is take out B and give us more A  in other words make the illusions just that.. an illusion.. something that doesn't affect the object just makes it appear to be something its not.  Then let us become (allmost) anything.  Give us a factionless mimic spell at 60th.  Let us create the illusion of a bear.. let us create the illusion of a spectre.. let us create the illusion of a fire beetle.. If we want the illusion give it to us... but make it NOTHING but the illusion.  I would gladly give up that small str boost in werewolf form and earth ele form and the levi bonus of the air ele form to actually be what you say I am and become an illusionist instead of a person who can change forms.  <P>I hope I made at least some sence.  Let the necros and druids and shamans and whoever else have thier unique ability to change forms.  Give us the ability to create the illusion.. like the illusionist you claim us to be.<P>Loria Lanesly<BR>46 Enchantress Of Spirit of Tunare<BR>Rathe Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Loria,<P>That's about the hundreth statement concerning transformations vs. Illusions<P>Furthermore, what you, and some other enchanters seem to sleep through is this:<P>ILLUSIONS + SPELL EFFECTS give STAT BOOSTS!<P>Jesus Christ, people.. is it that hard to comprehend?<P>Illusion Earth Elemental: Illusion + our 10 point STR spell<P>Illusion Fire Elemental: Illusion + Feedback<P>Illusion Water Elemental: Illusion + Enduring Breath<P>Illusion Air Elemental: Illusion + Levitate<P>Illusion Dark Elf: Illusion + Ultravision<P>The only ones that aren't explained by this are the ATK increase with Werewolf, and the TEENY TINY regen associated with Troll and Iksar (1/tick)<P>So, the illusions combine with our actual spells to accomplish a more realistic illusion.  We don't make a creature who hits us as a Fire Elemental THINK he took damage, he DOES take damage because therte is a VERY REAL damage shield there.  The other explanation is just too silly.<P>Oh.. wait.. i think  maybe i'm.. stronger.. i look like an Earth elemental..  i'm HERCULES!  Just too silly for words.  And the idea of Illusory speed.. .  That's dumb.  <P>Sorry to sound so hostile, but I want more Illusions.  I see FOUR types of people here, 3 of which PISS ME OFF!:<P>1) Trolls:  Shut up and leave.  You may think that we are so powerful, but having our class chipped at, even a little, from several different angles is starting to realy wear away at us.  a) No new illusions, post 44, b) Mezz is CRAP post 50, c) Mezz is useless in Velious, d) Passing out Clarity type effects to MORE classes, etc..<P>2) Wimpy Enchanters:  "Well, give us Illusion Flower so we can sit and look neat!  No stat bonuses and DOUBLE Xp loss if we die!  We'll even  have it reduce all of our stats to 0 for the duration!  Just please please please..."  Shut up.<P>3) Sour Grapes Enchanters:  "Bah!  Screw Illusions, i'm not all about illusions anyway.  Illsuions won't save your ass in Sebilis, Private!  MARCH MARCH! Mezz that Mob!  Clarity that Wizard, Soldier!  Wipe that Illusion off your face, scumbag!  We have MENS work to do here!"  Shut up.<P>4) The rest of us:  Well, we are Illusionists, with no high level illusions and Verant has stated they have no intention of giving us anymore.  Oh, and to that Druid claiming it takes him/her sooo long to get in a group.. Poor baby.  Want a cookie?  I spent 2 hours in Great Divide trying to get a group last night.  My Reputation is flawless.

</FONT><HR>Well my Druid can cast transformation wolf form on anyone, so I guess that is a unique ability. The Wizzards can teleport to Hate, and Air, so that is a unique ability. My Shamen can shrink someone else, my Rogue can backstab, my Monk can mend, pallys' Lay of Hands, Sk harmtouch, and ...<P>Unique abilities are nice. They make playing a different class fun and challenging. Giving Spectre Illusion to Necros may be a slap in the face to enchanters, but it is logical. Giving a shamen the ability to turn into a bear makes sence as well. Having Mages able to summon a monster is nice, but they should have made it a warrior, not simply an elemental with an illusion.<P>Overall Velious rocks. The design team did a great job with it. The new variety of spells finally give hybrids something. <P>But this is a discussion about illusions, and lack there of after 44th. <P>I actually love all the new items added to the game. I love the fact that druids get a pet, mages summon a illusioned pet, and shamen and necros get a new form. I am just disheartened by the lack of a new enchanter Illusion. <P>At least thier sounds like a chance of an Evil Eye illusion. I am hoping for a levatate, 40cha and 7mana per tick level 51 Eye. Just saves me from casting buffs on myself like all my other Illusions.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I love how they change their tune.  Before the new illusions were given to the other classes, not ONE word was said of "We want other classes to have illusions, it is ok if they do and you don't have them, you are STILL the masters of illusions."   Does anyone remember that?  I sure don't.  All I remember is "We can't do it, the global file won't let us."  After they added illusions to the global file, anyway, NOW is when the concept of giving other classes these things comes up. <P>Is this not easy to understand?  This is where the concept of the whole thing being a *lie* comes from.  Previously the only thing standing in the way of new illusions was the global file, and POSSIBLY the polygon count.  Now however, both of those problems are not the reasons, so they just say "We don't want you to have them."  Could they not have said this before?  This obviously is a case of backpeddling to try (unsuccessfully) to cover their "reasons" that they had for not giving enchanters illusions.  <P>This is one very good reason that I am not buying Vellious.  I am not cancelling, but Vellious contains nothing for me.  <P>I remember Abashi saying something months back about how they wanted to add fun spells.  I suppose they debated that one again and had a change of heart.   I don't see how it is not obvious, and do they not say this themselves? "Adding to one class does not detract from another.  Giving one class an ability does not make another class who has it weaker"<BR>This is a Verant belief, correct?   Continue the logical extension of that, and apply it to illusions.  Giving Enchanters Illusion Spectre does NOT detract from Necros in any way.  They both will enjoy it and it does not unbalance in any way, or detract from Necros.   The same applys to the other new illusions the other classes get, but I think the Spectre illusion is the big one that most people want, and have asked for, for about a year or so that I am aware of.<P>I'd like to know if adding to one class does or  does not detract from another, because you seems a bit inconsistent about this.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>To Araeli:<P>"Yet there you are, upset because for once, Verant gave an illusion to a class other than yourselves, and you can't do it too"<P>No, we are upset because we were told that it was techically impossible to add more models to the global file to give us illusions post 44. Then they add two models to the file, and give them to another class. Then they say that there will be no more forthcoming because there is no more room.<P>I could care less whether I got illusion bear or illusion spectre. I do care that I get some sort of illusion post 44 to make me worthy of my title of "illusionist". I worked darn hard through 54 levels, most of that group xp" because soloing for enchanters with charm was jus too risky and unreliabel for my taste. By the time I had 125 days played and was lvl 54, most of the necro and druid friends I knew had been lvl 60 for months. I am even called an illusionist from lvls 51-54, which with VI's line of thinking is a big slap in my face now. We wern't asking to be able to solo, we weren't asking for anything to upset the balance here. All we were asking for was to be able to live up to our title and have illusions post 44. The only reason the bear or spectre illusion is brought up now by enchanters is that it is something cool in the global files, and therefore technically possible to do.<P>Thank god I am wanted in groups, for I sure can't solo at 54. Anything I can kill solo for xp is high green and not worth the time or the risk of doing it. when a green hits you for 120+ damage for each attack, it doesnt take long to decimate my 1000 hp to zero. You, on the other hand, have enough versatility that you can solo for amazing xp quad kiting OR group. You have a choice. I don't. without that group desirability, I my character would have been dead in the water months ago.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>All in all..<BR>as other people sum up what we want.<P>I am an enchanter level 43 as of last night. DING hehe.. thanx..<P>I've been playing the game for some time.  I've worked on Jewel Craft (which all enchanters and some others know.  Is quite expensive.  I've got about 205 now but that is still LOW if you want to make money.. you need 120plat min per platnum item at this point if you fail you loose it.  So You need 10k to continue past level 205.  I am not complaining about this though.<P>I myself like the enchanter for 2 reasons.  1 formost is crowd control.  I like being able to put a mob out of the game untill the group is ready for him.  Many pullers often pull to much due to not being able to FD.  My job is to make sure the mobs were not fighting are mezzed.<P>The 2nd reason I like the enchnater is that my "Known" Faction didn't really matter.  I could illusion myself into a "Dark Elf" and gain the faction of the dark elves.  I could go into the trolls area and make myself at home.  Now I know that there is a "VISION"tm that the makers of everquest have.  And I do know that the new areas are made so that your actions choise your faction.  But I saw 3 new spells so far on the line of the enchnater..  all having the SAME basic nature and ONLY helping a person IF they are Full On Mana.  Wait there is also on the higher level spells a +1 mana per tick increase.  I dont know what the stacking issues are.<P>Now I've seen many new spells for other classes.  I myself did expect new illusions.  No I dont care about the mages new pet (even though it DOES sound like the exact spell that I wanted for self mutation)  I dont care about the spectre for the necros.  I basically expected as with all OTHER FAC base classes that I would be able to "Illusion" myself to fit in.  I got to velious and a GIANT attacked me.. Well since I'm killed it more giants attack me.  Okay fine.  That choose my faction.  But as an enchatner shouldn't I be able to cast an illusion to "HIDE" my identity?  Or was that just and OLD idea that you are trying to fade out?   I'm liked that OLD idea and so did many others.  I'm not asking you to give us ALL the global room.  I dont want bear.  I dont want spectre.  I DO want more illusions that will help our faction with the NEW factions.<P>You took away the "FUN" of illusions in kunark. Basically cause all of our illusions are either useless, or make us KOS immediatly.  And now again you do it in velious.  I want the power of illusion back.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I was very hesitant to start playing this game. I had most of my circle of friends trying since it's release to get me to join them. The thing that finally convinced me to start playing was one of my freinds telling me about teh enchanters and their illusions.  She told me stories of charcters becoming money for people to try and pick up, chest of drawers in the middle of fields casting spells on mobs, and of a certain guildmate of her's who she never saw as the same race twice in a row.  My only character is an enchanter, and Minor Illusion is still my favorite spell.  This is the reason I play the game.  <BR>I understand about Necro's and Shaman having their transformations, and they can keep them.  And I can perfectly understand the reasoning behind not wanting us to be able to become any creature in the zone.  As an old table-top GM I understand that very well.  But if we got Illusion: Orc at a higher level, even if we get faction from it, it isn't gonna make a big differnce.  A high level character isn't gonna need to worry much about Orcs anyway.  Or Illusion: willowisp...shouldn't take much space in the global files and so what if we bocome the party's roving lightstone.  Illusion: Gender would be just fun.  Isn't fun what games are supposed to be about?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Does anyone else remember a time when the game designers were adamant about NOT giving a method of increased mana regeneration to any classes other than enchanters and bards?<P>You'll notice that Necros have always had a way, Mages got rod, Wizards got a spell, Shamen have always had a way, and now druids get a mana regen buff as well.<P>Mez and charm don't work against many new mobs, and our illusion pool is not any bigger.<P>What was it again that would make you want an enchanter in your group post 50?<P>Oh yea, speed. I guess that's the one thing we still do better than anyone else. <P>Speed.

</FONT><HR>One thing to keep in mind all of you illusion wanting people is this, we are in need of better mez, tash, dispell, mana sieve, type spells.<P>So if and when we get looked at and it turns out the only spells we get are illusion: Rock, i pray your not back here posting about how useless you feel because all you do is buff. I am going to retort with, "But you can do it looking like a rock!!! It's what you wanted!!!"<P>Our true power is in the form of control, NOT dressing up for halloween. Get your priorities straight, worry about things that make us as a class more viable in group combat situations, not stupid palor tricks that freak out lower lvl people in the Oasis.<P>I have a feeling that its you, the illusion wanting sect of chanters, that may drive the final nail in our classes coffins. Because you will see, either after you gain levels, or fight in areas where certain lines of spells (mez) are useless, that all your complaining about wanting illusions should have been concentrated on real issues, and not fluff ones.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have an idea that could solve the enchanter illusion wants with a single new spell. A copy cat spell that doesnt copy NPCs but PCs. This spell would copy the target PCs race, equipment and face. Basically copy exactly how the other player looksnothing else. I think it would be a neat spell for enchanters and finally deem them true masters of illusion. Please consider or add your opinion to this idea.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041319-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041319.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041319-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041319-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=041319&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=041319&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
