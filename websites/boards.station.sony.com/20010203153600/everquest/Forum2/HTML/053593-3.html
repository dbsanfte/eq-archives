</FONT><HR>I am getting very very tired of these race envy posts.  I don't recall any other class having such a case of race envy as monks.  <P>If humans are so second rate compared to Iksar why do I see so many new human monks being created?<P>Everyone who hasn't done it says faction is easy to fix.  Faction is fixable but it's not easy.  It takes hundreds of hours to fix in all the places Iksar are KoS.  Hours which could have been spent leveling or getting uber-items are instead spent doing quests over and over and over or killing greens over and over and over.  In effect Iksar have two experience penalties.  The first is the 20% penalty for being Iksar -- so they'll take 20% longer to level.  The second is the faction penalty which could easily add another 20% if they want to fix it.  If they don't fix it then they'll have a VERY rough time adventuring in Antonica and Faydwer with no banks and a 14 stone weight limit.  So either way the bad faction of Iksar is a major disadvantage.  Most Iksar I know don't even bother to fix faction because it's even more of a pain to fix then it is to be KoS.<P>If you want quests to give humans advantages comparable to Iksar, then those quests should be VERY long and involved such that they take several hundred hours.  Humans should spend as much time counteracting their disadvantages as Iksar would have to spend counteracting THEIR disadvantages.  <P>Iksar regen is nice but it's ONLY useful when soloing or in a group without any sort of healer (not exactly common).  If you want to rely on regin for healing, the downtime when soloing is still enormous and you'll do MUCH better grouped with at least a healer.  Once you're grouped with a healer regin is irrelevant.  Consequently, regen does NOT make Iksar level faster, it instead makes Iksar more casual gamer friendly by making it possible to logon for 20 minutes and at least do SOMETHING.  Finally, to anyone who considers regin such a big deal, did you consider troll warrior when you were creating your character?  If not then obviously regin wasn't such a big deal then so why is it now?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Quoted:<BR>Player:<BR>"Too much armor and weapons for monks. Their "defining characteristic" was supposed to be unarmed combat, plus a refreshing indifference to loot since they had nothing to buy and couldn't carry it anyway. That all went out the window when items starting being used as kludges to increase the power of monks without really increasing the power of monks. Just go ahead and increase the power of monks directly. If you want it rare, implement some interesting monk quests where they can have their intrinsic AC or dam/delay raised through a quest rather than a item, possibly getting those quest items off the same mobs with the same frequencies as monk item drops now. They could be questhounds rather than gearhounds. But, alas, it's too late for that now, I guess. "<P>Absor:<BR>"Well, it's never too late to ask. I like the idea of making monks more reliant on their hands than on weapons, on their skills than on armor. You're right, it might be too late to make such a dramatic change. But it warrants at least asking. There's no reason that a skill can't be just as hard to get as an item, just put the trainer at the end of a tough quest. "<P>Absor: Why not see if the team can come up with a pair of Gloves that would truly rival most weapons (maces/staff/etc) at the Monk's level? You mentioned not wanting to increase offensive power for the Monk because of comparable damage output to that of Warriors/Rogues; and also liking to the idea of bringing the image of a Monk with bare fists back into the game. Well here is an idea to help solve that:<P>Monk Guild Masters will offer a quest to the Monk at level 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60. Each time the quest is completed it results in a pair of magical gloves. Each quest after requires the gloves from the quest before (Level 30 quest requires the level 20 gloves, etc.). Make these gloves NODROP, LORE, very lightweight, very high AC, stat bonuses, and while wearing them you cannot equip primary/secondary weapon slots. The offset to this is the fact that the damage output is not up to par with the other weapons out there, but the defensive abilities are. This will give a Monk essentially two paths to choose: Weapons and lower defensive ability, or "traditional" look with gloves with higher defensive ability and no weapons. Make the gloves with a better ratio than bare hands at each of those levels. Possibly not even allow the player to see the ratio of damage/delay on them...leave it a mystery.<P> Involve the player in the quest though. Make them travel and seek out other Masters around the world (Possibly place "lost masters" in dungeons across Norrath they need to obtain an item from and bring back to their masters). But most importantly: Do *not* make it where they need ten groups of higher levels to get the item. It should mean something to accomplish the quest personally, not in a raid-type battle. And lastly, do not allow multi-questing for them.<P>Just an idea is all..<P>-Rev</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor-<P>We as a monk community need to get several points across to you that we feel you took incorrectly.  It is of utmost importance that you understand 100% what was meant by several of the suggestions you put on your "list".  So much that if taken incorrectly, your team and co-workers will either implement something that we did not want due to miscommunication or you and your team will simply overlook our ideas.<P>&gt;MoorGhost bravely stated:<P>"8) Epic quest is too easy. This may not be a popular opinion, but it is true. The Robe of the Lost Circle is obtainable by killing the quest NPC's (please change this). Headbands and sashes can be traded instead of quested for. The Robe of the Whistling Fists can be multi-quested. Once the last robe is obtained, three groups can do all four of the battles needed to get the fists, and none of the mobs are rare spawns. In theory, you only need to camp two components - the pipes for the RotWF - the rest can be purchased or killed for. Our epic weapon should mean more than that."<P>Thanks for saying that. I appreciate it. And, well, it will end up on the list.&lt;<P>I think you grossly misread this post.  In the case I'm wrong, I'm sorry.  But in the case I'm right, please understand.  This post was meant to show you that it is possible to twink and cheat this quest which I KNOW was not meant to be done via the Verant design team.  Please read below and understand.<P>Sashes/Headbands:  These are not NO DROP and thus can be purchases.  They can also be done by mules of Iksars who do not wish to go through the trouble of fixing faction problems.<P>Robe of the Lost Circle:  Can be obtained by killing either Brother Zephyl in Rathe Mountains or Brother Qwinn in South Karana.  This robe can also be multi-quested.<P>Robe of the Whistling Fists:  Can be obtained via multiquesting.<P>Celestial Fists:  Book of the Celestial Fists can be obtained by giving the Sky Fire book, not NO DROP and COMMON, and the Robe of the Whistling Fists, easily obtained via multiquesting.  Fang off of Xenovorash is easily obtained by allowing friends to kill the Elemental Masters and both versions of Vorash and having a lower level monk loot the fang.<P>SOLUTION:<P>Make all sashes/headbands NO DROP<BR>Take the robe off of Brother Zephyl/Brother Qwinn<BR>Do not allow for multi-questing either robe<BR>Have Kaiaren hand the quester a container and have the the fang and Book of the Celestial Fists be combined and handed back into Kaiaren in order to receive the epic.<P>&gt;Anon wrote:<P>"Allowing us to strike just as hard with the off-hand as the primary will solve the damage-dealing problem and bring us up to the correct damage level of being between warriors and rogues.<P>If this change is made, you will need to remove MNK as a class capable of using the moss-covered twig, a weapon changed to be off-hand only because of the large amount of damage it does when a damage bonus is applied."<P>Maybe… it also sounds like it has a very high potential chance of bringing that damage output well above rogues… And having to go back and look over every monk-usable weapon list to make sure one of them isn't broken because of a change like this, well, that puts this idea very low on the list.&lt;<P>I am very sure that you have misunderstood the purpose behind this.  We ARE NOT askind for an equal damage bonus on each hand for One Hand Blunt AND Hand to Hand...we are asking for this STRICTLY for Hand to Hand only.  Leave the weapons alone.  The purpose behind a monk is to have his or her body BE the weapon.  Kunark introduce many weapons to monks in order to maintain the balance of power among the melee classes.  But with the epic and a surge of "back to basics", we simply want equal damage on BOTH BARE FISTS.  Please read this and understand this.<P>&gt;Gestaltmind wrote:<P>"Perhaps some old abilities might gain new twists as you got high level-like crical hits on a normal kick are you reach level 50."<P>I like this idea, it makes sense.  But once again, only if monks really need a combat boost.&lt;<P>YES ALAN, we do need a combat boost.  And though I would agree with the idea of doing something different with the old attacks, they are just that...OLD.  The reason they're no longer used is because we learn better forms of attack thus making the old forms no longer needed or wanted.  That is the point of progression and leveling.  If you want to add criticals, than see below:<P>THUNDERKICK:<P>Make this an ability once we reach 51.  You can move the discipline STONE STANCE to 52 so that it falls in line with all of the other PURE melee classes (Rogues and Warriors begin their disciplines at 52).  By making this an ability, you would leave Flying Kick as it is now.  But give Flying Kick the chance to land as a THunderous Kick, much like a warrior has a chance to land a critical or crippling blow.  Of course you would have to increase the chance of landing such an attack due to the long recycle time of Flying Kick.  PROBLEM SOLVED&gt;<P>&gt;THE_FNORD said:<P>"Give us triple attack"<P>I'll assume that this might be one method of placing the monk's damage output between warriors and rogues.&lt;<P>OK, as a 51 monk, I can tell you that neither I, nor the rest of the community, needs or wants this.  This is not what we had intended in order to boost our damage output.<P>If you want to boost our damage output, than pay special attention to placing a MINIMUM damage amount on our special attacks.  I noticed that you placed that on your list and I thank you for that.<P>&gt;Pantheon wrote"<P>"Throwing should get a chance of doing criticals."<P>Interesting idea.  This can also be used to increase monks damage a bit.  That is, IF it need to be increased.  But if anyone is going to be the master of throwing, it may as well be monks.&lt;<P>Monks are not the masters of the Throwing Skill.  A Rogue's skill caps 30 points higher than a monk's.  Plus, the Throwing Skill, much like the Archery skill, is used so rarely that even by giving us the ability to critical, it will in no way boost our damage output to an acceptable level.  And besides that, do you really expect monks to enter into combat by just throwing daggers and shurikens when our primary source of combat is our hands and feet?<P>&gt;brin_summer said:<P>"Why not give each skill distinct traits?  for example..round kick would attain stunning ability, tiger claw would attain debuff effect, dragon punch would do 2% of mob's health damage, and flying kick would deal high damage etc.  I am sure you guys can come up with better traits."<P>Certainly an interesting idea.  It might be a nightmare to balance, though.  And it might add too much to the power of the class.  But it is a solid idea.&lt;<P>Though these ideas do have merit, they will, as you say, over power the class too much.  Warriors get stun at 55 so why should we get it at 5?<P>&gt;Anon wrote:<P>"Please please make Thunder Kick less of an embarassment.  Those 24 point kicks are just silly.  Since monks get no special discipline at 55, how about adding one with a stun component?"<P>That seems to be a good way to introduce a stun ability, if we decide to go that route.&lt;<P>OK, the idea to fix Thunderkick is wonderful.  It is easily taken care of with the use of a MINIMUM damage level.  That is already on your list of things to address and we thank you.<P>STUN on T-Kick is a bad idea.  We already get a discipline at 60 that allows us to stun called "Silent Fist".  Please do not add this to T-Kick.<P>&gt;Zadkiel said:<P>"3a) Encourage usage and training of lesser monk special attacks. Either allow us to use one type of strike and one type of kick at the same time by unhooking the special attack re-use timers post-50, or give the possibility of attack "strings". (This is the preferred solution, but would be harder to implement.) If a monk successfully uses Flying Kick on an enemy -- connects for damage -- then give a chance (based on Double Attack skill, preferably) for the monk to automatically use Dragon Punch/Tail Rake. If Dragon Punch/Tail Rake connects for damage, give a slightly lesser chance of doing an Eagle Strike. This is not only an interesting solution, it would make raising all of the monk special attack skills more important. This would be a post-50 enchancement, or when a monk reaches 200 skill in Flying Kick."<P>Also interesting. Of course, this sounds an awful lot like triple attack… but done in a monkly fashion.&lt;<P>Yes, this does sound a lot like "Triple Attack" but done in a monkly fashion.  Though I am against this, Burnstain later proposed an idea that would probably be much easier via programming and exactly along the lines of something Zadkiel had posted:<P>&gt;Burnstain wrote:<P>"C. Un-bind the Strike and Kick attacks. A monk could use Flying Kick and a Tiger Claw independently of one another."&lt;<P>This would probably be the best method of doing so.  Please weigh both of these ideas.<P>&gt;THE_FNORD wrote:<P>"Make one or all of our special attacks stun"&lt;<P>The main reason you see so many replies for this is because as a class that has very little options for resist gear and does not have an INNATE magic resist as warriors, we need a way to interrupt casters.  Many times, the monk IS the tank in the group as there is no warrior present.  When this situation occurs, and it occurs very often, we monks are left getting nuked because we cannot interrupt.  Large race warriors get Slam which stuns for 1 second, small race warriors, Shadow Knights, and Paladins get Shield Bash which stuns for 1 second, and all warriors get a Stunning Kick at lvl 55.  Any and all of those abilities can interrupt casters yet we have nothing allowing us to do so.  We have 6 special attacks and none give us the chance to interrupt.  I personally feel that giving a monk STUN, even for just 1 second, is too much.  But giving us the ability to just "push back" the caster with our specials is EXACTLY what we need.<P>Thank you Alan for looking at our needs.  I can only hope that this has caught your attention and that you will read this so as you have a better understanding of what you put on your "list".</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>On the weapon/damage idea..Abashi has gone over and over that the system is not designed so that gloves can be weapons so instead of asking for that my suggestion is to make a monk only weapon with NO VISIBLE GRAPHIC..the items icon graphic can look like a glove so in your inventory in your primary weapon slot you will see a glove, if you happen to have 2 of them you'd also have one in your offhand slot. This avoids the whole "gloves can't be weapons" problem and can be implemented similar to the sash and headband quests. (ok..only drawback is that you would be using 1hb skill instead of H2H..but hey it's a start)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Nicely put Nyog Tha, thank you.<P>Throwing is not the domain of the Monk, and should not be. It is not the profile of a toe-to-toe damage dealer.<P>Feign death - I for one *do not* want the feign death button to be a "toggle". Instead, "Sit" should be more clearly labelled "Stand" after a feign death. Even this is just sugar coating, of course.<P>Additionally, why is it that feign death is a perfectly good pulling tool, and yet fails to provide a means of escape or aggro reduction, particularly at higher levels? Multiple creatures will believe a feign during a pull, but forget about fooling just one creature during a fight (most noticeably while grouped)?<P>Does feign just reduce aggro *slightly* but, if you are still at the top of the list, fail completely? It would be nice to have this looked at.<P>Hand-to-hand - I would love to have a Monkly Renaissance restoring this skill to its former glory. I also don't think that it should happen for free. Why should other classes have to quest/camp/pay for their damage output when Monks get it for free? Level limited quests for a better hand-to-hand ratio seem to me to be a good choice for implementing this, whether the reward is a new pair of gloves, or ideally a new "specialization" skill.<P>Again, full support for the Monkly-Business post.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

This means a warrior can be using this discipline nearly half the time s/he is logged on.<P>WAR discip of Defensive:  Also lasts 3 minutes, reuse at 60 is merely 10 minutes.<P>Monks recieve a defensive discipline (Stone Stance) that lasts 12 SECONDS, and has a reuse of 3 minutes at level 60.<P>Monks also recieve Whirlwind, which lasts 9 seconds, and has a reuse time of 53 minutes at level 60.<P>Void Dance, 8 seconds, reuse 54 minutes later at level 60.<P>Alright, so we're monks and not Warriors.  It's not our job to be tanking and so maybe our defensive discipines shouldn't last very long.  What then, about our offensive ones?  Are we not by nature ment to be dishing out damage instead of taking it?  Our hitpoints and ac would seem to suggest this.  Would it be possible for y'all to examine the durations and reuse times of the monks disciplines?

</FONT><HR>Ok First off, I want to second Bodi/ Zadikels postings.( A detailed reading of this posting will give you a clear idea of what this class needs and wants)<P>Just to emphasise a few things.<P>1) We need some way of interupting casters.  Be it a stun, be it a special ability, or be it something else --  WE NEED THIS, as it stands every other class I am aware of with the possible exception of the rouge has some way of interupting a caster.<P>2) We need more varied apearances, all monks either look like Newbies or Casters.<P>3) Our planar equipment is ingeneral worse than available ALL/ALL equipment.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>  Wow, I can't believe I missed all of this, I finally had a chance to tell someone from Verant everything that was wrong with the monk class and I had to work through it...quel bummer.<P>  So I'll post it anyways, cause here it is.<P> FIRST of all, to the person who keeps saying monks are always soloing, let me know where you buy your crack.<P>  Now, onto the real problems...<P> 1) Yes, we have FD, but tell me this, is having FD really worth everything we pay for it? I do less damage than a warrior, I have ALOT less hit points than a warrior, my ac is usually worse than a warrior... all of this for FD and MEND??<P> 2) Our planar armor is VERY easy to find... just follow the smell, it'll lead you right to Shiverback... wow does that stuff stink... what's wrong with you people at Verant?? Would it kill you to give our armor an actual armor class?? I'm not asking for retarded numbers here, but here's a few for you...<P>  Make our leggings ac 7 ( AT LEAST!!! ) then maybe we'll all stop wearing druid gear.  Why bother making monk sleeves that are MUCH harder to get than azure yet have HALF the ac?? Did you really think we would wear it?<P>  I'll spare you the total break down but the bottom line is, monk only armor as a general rule sucks, we usually only bother to wear the boots/shoes... bottom line is, we wear everyone elses gear because it's always better than our own. I'm not talking about some all/all headpiece that drops off a God somewhere... I'm talking about things as simple as Gatorscale leggings, Thick leather aprons, azure sleeves, Symbols of Loyalty to Vox... more monks wear these than anything else...why??  Better than anything you guys care to tack "Monk only" onto...sad really.<P>2) Can you guys put SOME effort into the way we look?? All our armor looks the same!! Unless you're wearing a Rotlc, at which point and time you get asked for ports all the time =) Sadly though, when you upgrade it to the Whistling Fist, you end up with a slightly watered down version of the Burinay Gi mid level clerics wear... personaly I don't WANT the Whistling Fist robe, it's ugly and my burgundy robe looks MUCH better.<P>3) You gather all these sashes and headbands that NO ONE WEARS (read: they suck) and then you trade them in for a Robe ( a nice robe too )...then you trade THAT in for ANOTHER Robe ( ugly, booooo ) and then you trade that for....gloves?? GLOVES?? *** am I supposed to put on my chest now?? What am I supposed to do with these Treant Fists I spent so long camping??? You killed all my quests in one fell swoop... not mentioning the fact that Gem inlaid gauntlets practically grow on trees, making the Treant Fist quest useless.<P>4) Disciplines...great idea...some of them are ok, some of them are not but all of them need to have their duration looked at... 9 seconds?? 12 seconds?? When the hell was the last time YOU were in a melee combat that lasted 9 seconds? I can understand not wanting to have disciplines that last 5 minutes... but damn! standard disciplines should be around 30-45 seconds...<P>5) Weight increase... spread it out, give me a reason to level past 50, hell give me 1 pound per level or something like that, while everyone else is getting cool new spells every level, the monks, rogues and warriors get hung out to dry because it's alot easier to come up with new spells than it is to try and do something interesting and remain balanced for the melee classes...<P>6) For the love of sweet Jesus, give us SOMETHING that can stun an opponent, or at least slow him down... Why don't treant fists proc snare or root?? I mean, they ARE Treant fists right?? Long ago they had a special ability, but you guys oopsed it... so instead of replacing it, you just deleted it...easy way to solve a problem, but also a crappy way to solve a problem.<P>7) Did I mention you can track monk only armor by smell??<P>8) We don't get a fraction of the gear other classes get, fine, we're monks, then make us LESS dependent on gear instead of telling us, we don't need gear and in the same breath telling us that with the RIGHT gear we are on par with other classes...so which is it?? Do I need gear or don't I?? Cause if I DO need gear, then give me some instead of making me fight over Druid/Enchanter/All-All gear with everyone else.<P>  I think that about covers it... I'm SURE I'm forgetting something but damn it, I'm sick of typing...<P>  Akio Kenji<BR>  Discipline of the 51st Storm<BR>  Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It was mentioned earlier that allowing monks both damage and defensiveness might be asking for too much, and I think i did an adequate job in part two for explaining why this isn't the case.  However I did have an idea based off someone else's post as to a way to allow monks to choose.  The idea would be to impliment specializations like casters get for alteration, abjuration, evocation etc, that only came into effect once the skill hit 50, just like with the caster specialization... this would allow the monk to choose his/her specialization.<P>Possible spheres would be:<BR>Evasive, so that any time the defense skill was checked, in addition to checking block/parry/riposite/ac, the specialization would cause block to be checked a second time.<P>Accurate, so that for every point above 50 in the specialization, the monk gets a +1 to attack skill.<P>Defensive, so that for every point above 50 in the specialization, the monk gets a +1 bonus to AC.<P>Offensive, perhaps would work sumular to critical hits for warriors, the check being on any attack and based off the skill.<P>Pressure Points, this would provide a check on any special attack (kick/strike type) that would would give a chance to stun the opponent.<P>Entangle, this would be triggered off of any successful hit and would produce an effect of a short duration slow spell (much like shaman/enchanters get) that significantly reduced the speed of the monster's attacks.  I would suggest allowing this stack with the superior spells of the shaman/enchanter.<P>I'm not saying this is the perfect solution, but it is one idea that would allow monks to choose whether they wanted to be defensive/offensive or other options.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ABSOR, PLEASE READ!!!<BR>I wasn't prepared for this thread to be started early and sincerely hope you get to read this because I'm not satisfied with the previous posts.<BR>I will attempt to make this short and simple.<P>Problem: Monks offer nothing to a group, they have no role.<P>I quote a response from Verant: "A warrior's primary role is not to deal damage".<BR>With new RoK and SoV weapons, monks now do the same damage as warriors on average, and less in many cases (I will prove this later).<BR>Now, if a monk does the same damage as a warrior, what is a monk's role?? I'll tell you, right now all a monk does is slow a group down. We are the most useless class in high level groups. WE OFFER NOTHING.<BR>Rogues: They out damage monks by FAR. They pick locks. They sense traps. They are a great addition and sometimes a necessity to groups.<BR>Warriors: They tank better than any other class. They can TAUNT.<BR>Monks: ??? We cannot taunt, we cannot get into pick-lock dungeons, we cannot sense traps. We do not out damage warriors and do not come CLOSE to matching a rogue's damage.<P>Solution: In short, give us SOMETHING to offer a group (preferably high damage output because that was supposed to be our role...).<P>I want to illustrate how warriors (only with one-handers) now match and in some cases surpass a monk's damage. I apologize if this is lengthy.<BR>Before I get into the numbers, let me point out that the RFS (2HB 19/20) was made non-usable for warriors because it was too damaging. Now, there are one-handed warrior combinations that surpass this... How can this make sense???<BR>Also, the RFS does more damage than the (40/35) staff from Veeshan's Peak... How does that make sense??<BR>The main problem lies within the damage bonus. Weapons seem to be created without considering this MAJOR aspect of their damage. Warriors, monks, and rogues all get this bonus to their main hand (no one gets an offhand bonus). Everytime the main hand hits, the bonus (+n) is added to the damage (1 becomes 9, 15 becomes 23, 25 becomes 33..). At level 51, the bonus is +8 I believe. For this reason alone, a 5/10 weapon will do much more damage than a 50/100 (many more "+8s" in a fight).<BR>This bonus DRAMITCALLY affects weapon damage. Lets take a look at common warrior weapons(ones I see everyday at my level, 52):<BR>Wurmslayer (25/40), Lamentation (9/19), Jareths Trident (11/22)<BR>Now look at monk weapons:<BR>Knuckle Duster (14/28), Wu Trance Stick (7/18)<BR>EACH warrior weapon beats EACH monk weapon.<BR>New SoV warrior weapons have ratios like..(10/18), (14/23), (13, 20)!!<BR>The Stave of Shielding is a rare monk weapon I left out (17/28). However, it is not as damaging as a Jade Mace (9/18), usable by MONKS AND WARRIORS.<P>I could write a book about this, but I'm taking too much space already. Even though the maximum chance any player will have to duel wield is 78%, one handed weapons out damage two handed weapons in almost all cases.<P>The bottom line is, monk weapons (one handed) are under par. A level 50 warrior can acquire weapons superior to monk weapons of that level. Uber warrior weapons beat uber monk weapons. Duel Jade Maces (I've seen several warriors with these) beats the uber Tranquil Staff (29/30).<BR>The MOST DAMAGING MONK would be one with a RFS. A warrior can out damage that weapon. PLEASE look into this.<BR>(If any tests are conducted, please make them on level 50 mobs or higher. I believe past tests were conducted on level 35 mobs, which is not as accurate for several reasons).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Verant says: "Monks are the master in damage dealings, rogues are second and warriors are third in the case of damage dealings."<BR>Facts are: The monk get outdamaged by warrior, rogue and in some degree rangers.<BR>Verant is only right if the server is a fresh one without characters from other servers.<P>Monks give up several stuff for gain several abilities:<P>They give up: weapon selection (no slashing and no piercing), Wearing stuff ability (Weight penalty going on AC), Selection of items (lot of stuff are not available to monk at all and another lot of stuff have the MONK tag but are still not usable well for monks because of the weight restrictions.) and the remaining items are very hard and difficult to obtain. Most monks (if they are not twinked) are wearing player maded stuff till higher levels! Lower hitpoints than a warrior. (They are about the same level as a rogue.) Lower AC than a warrior. No critical attacks. No crippling blows.<P>Monks gain the following abilities: Feign Death (FD), Instill Doubt (ID), Mending and the several kick and punch attacks. +1 HP regen while FD at lvl 55 and 60. <P>From all special skills a monk receive only ID needs no rework. All other needs some rework. (see below).<P>Now the stuff I would like to see to being changed:<P>EQUIPMENT: More and easier obtainable equipment.<BR>Planes items with no AC sucks completely. Then I'll stick with my Bracers of Errolisi and Bracers of Battle.<P>FEIGN DEATH: As it is considered an escape skill, it should be changed this way: FD should only work if the monk is below 40% of his full health.<BR>But then ths skill should work like the old way (full clearing the aggro after the mob returns to its spawnpoint).<P>FD as is at the actual moment is very buggy. It constantly fails if the monk is below 20% of his health. It has only a low chance to stick if the mob is lvl 35+. And it can fails if a buff is fading while a successful FD! (That happened to me once: I FDed, the mob walked away, suddenly the STR buff is gone, mob went back to me and killed me.) (I considered first to apply this skill if health is below 20% but that can be a sure death if the first FD skill check fails.)<P>MENDING: After Mending is reaching skill value 101 it does not improve its power after that.<BR>It is a fixed percentage that the Mend heals independly of how good your mend skill value is.<BR>My idea is to improve the percentage of heal by 1% per 10 skill points over 100. (A mend with 200 will heal 35% per use.)<P>KICK: Stays at is.<P>ROUND KICK: AOE kick that damages all mobs around the player. The damage is a bit smaller as the one from a kick.<P>TIGER CLAW: Stays as is.<P>EAGLE CLAW: A bit lower damage than Tiger Claw but with AC debuff on target.<P>DRAGON PUNCH: A bit lower damage than Tiger Claw with stun and pull back.<P>TAIL RAKE: Lower damage than DRAGON PUNCH but damages all mobs around the player.<P>FLYING KICK: Stays as is except that the minimal damage must be increased by a significant lvl.<BR>(It is insane that the rogue lvl 10 skill Backstab does more damage at minimum as a monk does with his lvl 30 skill at maximum!)<P>But another option is to rid off them and add 2 completly new skills (see below) .<P>H2H: Increase the damage between lvl 50 and 60.<P>LEVEL 55 and LEVEL 60 ABILITY. Rid off of it ant replace it with a dual strike on the special attack skills at lvl 55 and Triple strike at 60.<P>A monk using 1hb in each hand can possible outdamage a warrior using the same weapons by a very small amount, while a monk using 2hb will NEVER outdamage a warrior with the same weapon.<BR>Because the improved Dual Wield will not work while using 2hb. <P>Another issue are monks vs. spell casters:<BR>A monk goes down much faster than a warrior against spellcasters because: a) no improved magic resistance, b) no stun attack and c) lesser HP than a warrior.<P>Other players wrote already in the case about the fist damages.<P>Now an idea how to improve monk without making them to strong:<P>/begin of the description of the new monk<P>THE HINDRANCES: stays as they are except weight penalty: (lvl/4)+10. Ex: a lvl 60 monk can wear 25 weight without being affected by the weight penalty while a lvl 4 can only wear 11 weight without being affected.<P>THE BENEFITS: Feign Death in the reworked version as above. Mending in the reworked version as aboved. Instill Doubt stays the same way as today. Kick, Round Kick, Eagle Strike, Tiger Claw, Dragon Punch, Tailrake and Flying Kick are removed and get replaced by these 2 skills:<P>MARTIAL KICK at lvl 10: Works more like the BACKSTAB but is using the feets and has no back attack restriction. (Minimal dam = LVL; Maximal Dam = LVL*4). Cap at 200 at lvl 50; 250 at lvl 60.<P>MARTIAL STRIKE at lvl 20: Works somewhat like MARTIAL KICK but it is using the fists. Its damage is lower than the Martial Kick (Min Dam. LVL/2; max Dam = LVL*2) but it can deliver a stun. Cap at 200 at lvl 50; 250 at lvl 60<P>These 2 attacks works cumulative and not like the old kicks and punches one at a time. That is you can use the 2 attacks at the same time. The maximum damage with the 2 skills at once is 360. That is about the max. damage from a Flying Kick of a lvl 60 monk.<P>EVADE at lvl 30:<BR>Because of the damage output the monk will aggro the mob on him. With Evade he can lower the aggro.<BR>I add this because FD is no longer available till the monk drops below 40% health.<P>CRITICAL HIT at lvl 40: gains the ability to do critical hits but not crippling blows<P>LEVEL 55: Ability to TRIPLE STRIKE<P>LEVEL 60: Dual strike on MARTIAL KICK and MARTIAL STRIKE.<P>(Yes you noticed it, I switched places for the lvl 55 and 60 skills but that is only for the new monk)<P>DISCIPLINES: All disciplines should be reworked if they rely on the old special attack skills to fit these 2 new skill.<P>Modified power: Monks get improved Melee damage bonus: (LVL-10)/? instead of the (LVL-25)/? on the primary hand attacks. (This will result in about 5 to 8 damage more than a warrior of the same level) With this will the monk fits more in his role of being the master of damage dealing.<P>Do not forget that the hindrances still exists.<P>/End of the new monk description<P>I hear lots of people whining that monks can solo very well while rogues and warriors have to rely on healer classes. I can say that this is true but only as long the monk is below lvl 35. At lvl 35 and higher a monk can no longer solo because of the way FD will works now.<P>Yours Elfenfeuer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I just hope you remember there are two very different races that can be monks.  And consider the effects of any changes on both races.<P>&gt;Make all sashes/headbands NO DROP<P>Now I'm sorry but I have to disagree with this.  I'm an iksar monk and it is VERY hard to raise faction high enough to do the quests.  I don't think these should be nodrop.  This quest was designed pre-kunark and did not have iksar monks in mind.  But it's ok because you can have a friend human monk do the quests for these items for you.  These are low level quests and very easy to do at about 20+ (and you shouldnt be doing the robe until 35-40+).  So it's more a matter of convenience not balance.  Forcing iksar to spend lots of hours fixing faction so they can turn in lvl 1 gnoll scalps is stupid.  It's not about balance it's about human monks being jealous of iksars and wanting to "nerf" them.  Leave this be.  But do take the robes off the quest monks (just dont let them loot it).<P>Another thing is upgrading these headbands/sashes.  I don't really agree.  Human monks don't have a non-plate restriction, which is pretty much why iksars have their bracer quests.  A human can buy a symbol of loyalty to vox or a silver plated bracer for 10pp and have more ac then all but the last shackle.  And the shackle quests are extremely hard as is.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I haven't read every single post, so I don't know if this has been mentioned.<P>I'd love to see something along the lines of a "Leg sweep" skill.  This would be a skill that does minimal or no damage, and it wouldn't even have to stun.  I would just like to see it have a possibility of interrupting casters.  At low levels, all you have to do to interrupt casters is do a bit of damage in the time it takes them to cast the spell.  Past about level 30, their channeling ability makes it impossible to interrupt them (without a stun) unless you can manage to do 500-1000 points of damage in that same time, and post-40 it's really impossible.<P>I'd like to see this as a trainable skill that comes in around level 40-43 as opposed to a 50+ discipline with a prohibitive reuse time.  Interrupting casts is something we should be able to try multiple times per fight, not for a 10-second period every hour or so.  Put it in the same series as Flying Kick, or something.  I'm willing to trade off the average 3 points of FK damage for a stun that'll save me a couple hundred points of health.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>*****NOTE:  THIS IS A PARODY****<P>I warned that I would post this if the thread got too much into race envy.  Take THIS!<P>I think the best best way to balance monks as a class and the race war in general is to give Iksar a full range of special attacks.<P>Making us sound like godzilla is a must, as it will act as an area effect stunn, as the mob will (on instinct) be forced to sand, look up, and point in fear.<P>In light of the first part, we should also gain health from magic based attacks, and be able to redirect a portion of the attack back with our radiation breath.<P>Eye lasers is another, easily explainable as a enhancement of our infravision.<P>Iksar should get a natural triple attack as a result of our tail, and a potentially quad attack if we make a deal for an extra arm with the sarnak.<P>Iksar should indeed get hide, opposed to humans, as we are naturally reptillian and many lizzards have color changing abilities.<P>At charicter creation, Iksar monks should have some high end monk items waiting in the bank, to keep the 1% of non twinked iksar monks on a even playing feild.<P>Increacing Iksar monk ability will make monks in general more desireable as a class, since most other classes dont care about race, or notice. They simply know a monk is in the group and that is enough for them. Naturally, there should be some human balances as well.<P>In the presence of an iksar monk, a human monk should have a chance to proc "tail envy" which is a self buff strength and haste which detracts int and a bit of stamana. (poor things tend to wear themselves out trying to keep up)<P>A questable 'tail' that when worn on the pants slot will show a visable pink tail and add 50 ac.<P>A better chance for feign death to work. Naturally, not being iksar, the mobs will expect you to die more often.<P>An area effect flying kick, providing one shouts "far-feg-nug-gen" prior to landing the kick.<P>A ranged effect dragon punch, if one pre shouts "Ha-do-ken" in same fashion.<P>With properly timed key board inputs, we chould be able to get massive chain hits, complete with special effects and a mysterious 3rd party voice annoucing "Killer Combo!"<P>Humans should get quest, human only booties, from ak'anon named Nilts bladed rolling boots, which naturally increace movement speed by 100%, increaces kick damage by 15%, has 10 ac, but gives the slippery ice effect at all times and has a random chance of the fd animation occuring without being qued.<P>I hope this helps and everyone can unite behind this cause.<P>(There ya go Absor, something to break the monotony if you are somehow, still reading all this)<P>*********<P>On a more serious note.  We monks do want to keep up our place as mele masters.  As the game progressed, you have moved us away from martial artist to basically under tanked fighters.  Is it possible to add new, questable skills to keep in balance while keeping with the origonal vision of monks being hand to hand masters?  It would go well with the theory of being a monk, learning from the masters to build your skills.  Studying forbidden techniques, hidden styles.  It could be something to keep in mind as the game progresses, expansions happen, etc.  I personally would LOVE to have a class that builds skills as they mature, not phat lewt.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just a little contrast to the race envy issue.  Consider an Iksar Necro vs. Any other Necro. The regen of an iksar and the AC bonus are just staggering. An iksar take far less damage than their counterparts while in the Lich line of spells. This allows them to regen mana at an enourmous rate. They also invest less mana in regaining their hit points. Add onto that aproximately 40 in natural AC bonus, which is between 5-10% AC at endgame levels. Shaman look at the same things as well, although the AC difference is considerably less. <P>Just a little something to think about when talking about the Iksar race in general. They are often superior(SKs and Warriors are the exception)...<P>Zonn - 53 Dark Elf Heretic - Retired<BR>Axiss - 54 Iksar Disciple<BR>Prexus Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Allow me to clarify. I should not have said the epic quest was too easy per se, but rather that it is too easy to multiquest. I should also have provided the solution that another poster did, as illustrated below:<P>&gt;SOLUTION:<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt;Make all sashes/headbands NO DROP<BR>&gt;Take the robe off of Brother Zephyl/Brother Qwinn<BR>&gt;Do not allow for multi-questing either robe<BR>&gt;Have Kaiaren hand the quester a container and &gt;have the the fang and Book of the Celestial &gt;Fists be combined and handed back into Kaiaren &gt;in order to receive the epic.<P>The epic quest (for ALL classes) should not be multi-questable in any way. It should be hard, hard, hard, and the result should be worth the effort. The two main roadblocks to our epic are Raster and the two pipes. I certainly wouldn't want to see camping times increased for these things, but rather to ensure that only the monk doing the quest can actually turn the items in.<P>ABSOR - I agree with others that the role of the monk needs to be defined before true balance can be achieved. With warriors, paladins, and SK's being seen as the defensive tanks, and rogues seen as the ultimate melee damage dealers, where is the compelling reason to play the monk?<P>I have a feeling that significantly increasing the damage output of monks would be seen by Verant as unbalancing. So while I'd love to be doing the most damage of any melee class, I'm loathe to ask for much of a damage increase, even though I think we need one.<P>Instead, I see monks as needing a defensive increase, both in terms of avoiding damage and in terms of mitigating it.<P>Our defense skill caps at 252, so nothing can be done to raise that. How about raising the caps on block, dodge, and riposte to 252 (currently these cap at 230), thus giving us a slightly better chance at avoiding hits? Also, adding the parry skill might be in order. Yes, this is a weapons-based skill in theory, but even if the weapons of the monk are the hands, I think parry can be justified.<P>While Verant seems content to keep the AC values on our class-specific armor quite low, most of us feel we need higher AC. Why? Compared to warriors, our hit points are much, much lower. I understand that this is part of the balance equasion, and I accept that to a degree. However, unlike rogues, monks have no way to untaunt mobs that are aggro on us. Using Celestial Fists, all but the best warriors have a very hard time getting mobs off me, yet rogues are allowed not only to do higher damage than we do, but they have the means to avoid aggroing the mob (note: feign death is not a viable means of reducing aggro, for two reasons - it often does not fool the mob, especially on high-end encounters, and it takes the monk out of the battle while rogues can continue doing damage with Evade).<P>Possible solutions would be to:<P>A) increase monk hit points to a level somewhere between warriors and rogues.<P>B) give monks some better means to avoid or reduce aggro while in combat (perhaps making feign death act like the rogue's evade).<P>C) increase our AC, either naturally or by increasing values on our class-specific armors.<P>While I'd love to see our offensive power increase (and I think it should, at least in a small way), any increase in damage done is meaningless without an increase in our defensive capabilities.<P>And please, GIVE OUR EPIC GLOVES A GRAPHIC!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>(Sorry, personal crusade of a fashion slave.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I know this is way down the list, but I hope this will get read and considered.  I'd like to express my support for the compilation from Monkly Business first off.<P>The most important to me are add a minimum damage to FK and some sort of stun or more to the point, a way to interrupt casters.  Only now am I starting to run into casters that can really hurt me, and need some way to keep them from casting 300dd on my poor unarmored skin.<P><BR>I won't comment on armor or weapons as my level 35 monks lacks a lot of experience with higher level equipment.  I do want to comment on the quest stuff though.<P>Sashes and Headbands.  If they were not used in the epic quest nobody would bother.  I did wear mine, but only until I was able to make raw silk armor to replace.  Now they sit in the bank.<P>Treant Fist.  Got them at level 25.  Wore them until I got Gem Inlaid Gauntles at 28.  Only took me about 5hrs to get fists.  Guess I'm very lucky.<P>Collar of Nershika.  I JUST got this.  I started trying to get it at 19.  But because you have to kill a 30 ranger to get the Grim to spawn I could not even initiate the quest.  It immedietly went into the bank.  I did this quest only to say I did it, but I hope these can be made useful.<P>Now for a few suggestions.  Monks are of course supposed to be masters of the body.  We have a natural fire resistance. That is a start.  How about the ablility to raid all our natural resistances, most likely excluding magic.  Since that would more a power of the mind.  But do it in some interesting way.  Like questing to find master who could train us in mastering these new skills.  Could even uses existing quest NPCs.  I think Ejag would be a good one to train a monk in fire resistance and how about useing Raster to train poison resistance.  I would say start this process post 40.<P>I like the meditate idea I've seen mentioned previously.  You could tie something like that to the natural resistance you currently have.<P>One fun idea I had was to make alternate use of alcohol for monks.  Make it so when monks drink they get an AC boost.  Call it a Drunken Boxing effect.  Of course all the other effects would apply.<P>Thanks Verant for a great game.<BR>Soranin of Povar<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>There seems to be a lack of vision on Verant’s part when it comes to the role of monks in the game.  My vision of a monk is a master of martial arts. He dresses in light cloth or silk, wielding nothing but his bare hands and feet.  He is able to completely destroy anything in his way, sidestepping blows and beating his opponent into a pulp.    Sadly, upon playing my character countless levels, I find that this is not the case in the least.<P>My greatest embarrassment was when I tried to finish off a lvl 19 iksar shadowknight when he was oom and at 2.5 bubs, while I was lvl 18 and at full life.  I got my head beaten into the ground.  His weapon was hitting in the 40s, my fists were hitting for 14, max.  When  my life hit a bub and a half I ran for zone.. his life had risen to 3.5 bubs.  This is just not right.  <P><BR>Here are some recommendations I’ve come up with…<P>Increased damage<BR>We need to be more effective at dealing damage.  Period.  Monks should be the masters of close quarters combat.  I’ve mentioned a few ways in which to do this below.<P>Increased evasion to attacks.<BR>I realize that increasing both damage output and the ability to defend well may be asking too much, but hear me out.  Our ac is too low even given some of the best equipment available.  Our hitpoints are lacking comparing us to warriors, who have a much higher ac.  I propose that causing monks to dodge and block more often would help us survive longer, while keeping us out of the role of primary tank.  Another possibility is the ability to block from behind.  Have you been able to land a hit from behind on a real martial artist?   My point exactly.<P>Armor/weapons<BR>I wish that we didn’t need these tools to do our job, but unfortunately they prove necessary.  Its impossible to solo anything but something 5 levels lower than you unless you’ve traded your cured silk for something with ac, and your fists for something more damaging.  For armor, would it be possible to either make the nodrop monk stuff armor a bit better, or make it so we don’t need armor as much?  I’m all in favor of the latter.  As for weapons, I’m a true believer in using my fists.  That said, I don’t plan on using them ever again.  The damage compared to the available monk weapons is pitiful.  I do think that Monk weapons should be rare and quite potent, but not necessary by any stretch of the imagination.  Adding better hand to hand damage, possibly letting a Monk’s bare offhand do the same damage as his primary hand, or adding critical hits for hand to hand combat are some ideas to increase our reliance on the weapons we were born with.<P>Triple Attack<BR>So why do warriors get it when the masters of hand to hand don’t?  Monks thrive on many attacks, dealing less damage than a warrior, but adding up over time.  Triple attack is a skill that seems to make sense for monks, for hand to hand if not for all weapons.<P>Special Attacks<BR>I love the monk special attacks, but I feel that there is room for a little improvement.  Chaining attacks, where a flying kick may trigger a dragon punch, which may trigger an eagle strike, which may trigger a round kick, is a great way to add some damage to the class in a monkly manner.  I think that totally untying them would just lead to people binding a key that does all the specials at once.  I much prefer the chaining attacks idea.<P>Instill Doubt<BR>Instill Doubt is a skill that takes forever to work up, and seems provides little benefit.  You cannot use your special attacks while instilling doubt, thus rendering you less adept at dealing damage if you’re trying to fear something.  Perhaps this skill could be rendered independent of special attacks?<P>Resistances<BR>Monks are masters of their bodies, turning their fists into potent weapons and their bodies into hardened armor.  I think that given the potential weight (and expense) of resist gear for Monks, a small amount of natural resistance to all things would help, but not be terribly unbalancing.  Something like a 3-5% resist all at lvl 1 and every 20 levels thereafter, for instance<P>Sneak<BR>Not terribly useful.  You walk incredibly slow, and you end up slowly plodding around the back of a bad mob only to have another 3 come charging over the hill. There’s nothing more frustrating than seeing potential death running your way, but not being able to run out of the way, as stopping your sneak could agro the first monster on you.  The only thing I use sneak for is when sitting down to regen hit points (and I do a lot of sitting).  I don’t want to intrude on rogues and ask for the ability to hide, but it would be a nice addition.  Perhaps an increase in the walking speed of a monk would work as well.<P>Mend<BR>Its saved my life more times than I can count, but I find it odd that it will never fail after 100, yet it can advance in skill far above that?  Why bother letting it increase past 100 unless its going to start healing more at higher levels?  Or something of the sort.<P>Feign death<BR>Pre 35 we’re fine, post that, we’re screwed.  Feign becomes nothing more than a way to get things off you temporarily so you can run for zone or /q out.  I realize that getting rid of this ‘feature’ of post 35 mobs will probably make feign pulling much more prevalent, but for this skill to be useful to most people, it needs to completely wipe the monk off of everything’s hate list.  I primarily use it when scouting, and having things reagro you when you stand up, no matter where they are, is a bad thing. I can’t count the number of times I’ve died because I feigned off something only to have it chase me down later.  Then there’s casters, which pretty much render feign death difficult to useless unless you are lucky and have great timing.  Don’t know what can be done about that as I imagine trying to cause casting on a feigned monk to not break the feign would be quite a task.<P>Weight<BR>I’m all for the weight limit.  What I’m not for is that by adhering to this limit, your monk loses the ability to carry coin, loot, and much needed items such as food and bandages.  Weight reduction bags are a monk’s best friend, but unattainable at lower levels.<P>Stunning<BR>One of the things I hate most in this world is being stunned by mobs.  Since level 5 I’ve been getting my wits knocked out of me temporarily while my enemy enjoys the sudden lack of attacks on my part.  Warriors, paladins, and shadowknights can bash at level 6 providing them with the ability to stun.  I realize that bash is intended to be used with a shield, but it does work without one.  Is there the chance that the monk special attacks can all have a small chance of stunning the opponent?  This would serve to lessen the damage we take in battles, effectively increasing our hitpoints and staying power.<P>Taunting<BR>I think that giving monks the ability to taunt could be a terribly unbalancing skill, but I’d still like to ask for it.  On the plus side, monks could pull mobs off the casters with as much ease as the warriors.  Albeit, they cannot last long under the punishment, but certainly better than the one they taunted the mob off of.  I see this being abused by monks taunting things off people, leading them into the middle of nowhere, and feigning them off.  This could provide an easy method of giving your group time to zone, while giving the monk a much higher chance of surviving the valiant effort compared to other taunting classes.  In spite of all that, I would still love to be able to save my caster’s life rather than stand there in futility beating at the back of the monster in a vein attempt to get him off the caster.<P><BR>I truly hope that this discussion helps the Verant team rediscover the vision of the monk.  I’d like to thank all the Monks in the world for rising up to state your views and help us get some attention.<P>Daenok, Vallon Zek<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

A way to give a monk a special skill without linking it to a higher level skill (making that skill too powerful), and giving it the limitation of much reduced damage.<P>This was only a thought, as I am not really convinced that monks really need any new skills.  They have a pretty solid selection as it is.<P>&gt;"OK, the idea to fix Thunderkick is wonderful. It is easily taken care of with the use of a MINIMUM damage level.

Please do not add this to T-Kick."&lt;<P>Got it.  Obviously I haven't had time to familiarize myself with all of the skills that a monk gets.  I was sorta relying on you guys to help me out there.  Once I have these lists of ideas, though, I am going to give them all a reality check.  I suspect that the stun on Thunderkick idea would have been tossed out when I got up to speed and discovered that it was an ability that monks already got at 60th level.  Obviously it's possible to give a stun earlier, but probably not warranted.  Thanks for the heads up.<P>&gt;"This would probably be the best method of doing so. Please weigh both of these ideas."&lt;<P>We will.  I think these might be the best two idea for raising monk damage a bit.  But, again, let me clarify that I am not convinced this is needed.  We'll have to decide if the class needs more damage post 50 before we even look at these.  But I don't think either of these ideas is easier (linked special attacks and unlinking foot/hand attacks) than the other from a programming standpoint.  I don't know for sure, but they sound like they might actually both be fairly easy to do (I can hear the programmers screaming now, I can see them lighting torches…)<P>&gt;"But giving us the ability to just "push back" the caster with our specials is EXACTLY what we need."&lt;<P>Fair enough.  And maybe not with all of the attacks.  Perhaps all past a certain level, or all kicks…  something like that.

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>With regards to Nyog's post, I would suggest some alternative points of view on the CF quest:<P>1.)  Move Kaiaren to the Plane of Sky.  That way, even if a level 5 monk loots the fang, he can't turn it in until he's plane ready.<P>2.)  Big debate on removing the robes from Brother Zephyl and Qwinn.  Assembling enough people to kill them is no small task.  It's basically like fighting a dragon.  Some Iksar see it as a roleplay.  Doesn't bother me if robes are removed, just understand the other point of view and take that to the meeting.<P>3.)  This game is designed for grouping, making allies, etc.  No monk, I'll repeat, no monk does his epic quest solo.  They have guilds, friends, whoever they can muster, help them along the way.  Multi-questing is in line with this in my view.  Obviously, exploits that allow low level monks to get CF's need to be addressed (see point 1, moving Kaiaren to PoS), but if I've spent hours camping Raster for my Robe of the Lost Circle, and I get a tell from a cleric buddy saying "Hey man! We just looted a pipe!" then great!  That is a tribute to the friendships I've made in the game.  We, as a group, can go complete the quest.  Groups kill mobs, groups should be able to help each other with quests.<P>4.)  Making headbands and sashes no drop needs to open another avenue for Iksar to get to the RoTLC.  Contrary to popular belief, sometimes people choose evil races in this game so they can actually "roleplay."  Some Iksar *gasp* don't want faction with the Qeynos or Freeport monks.  Now if the Robe was handed out by them, then great, no faction, no robe, but the quest is given by Zephyl and Qwinn, beta neutral, not aligned with either Silent Fist or Ashen Order.  They would either need to be gankable (sash currently is.. not sure about headband), or the Brother's would accept some of the shackles possibly.  Anyway, I hope you get the idea behind this.<P>Thanks,<BR>Vladin<P>/em waves at Nyog, his debate nemisis.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Weight issue: I would like to see an Item that would reduce over all weight by 10% to 15%. Lore No Drop and somewhat easy to get with a group of 6. And to work must not be in any type of bag or container, or better yet range slot. <P>Feign Death: They gave us a skill that stopped us from taking a death. We started to pull with the skill. Its time we get the skill back. Let us FD after we stop attacking and let it clear agro. <P>Weapons: I started a Monk because I liked the idea of not depending on weapons. They took that away. Id say increase H2H output. I don’t want to depend on a weapon. <P>Armor: We need more armor with HP, AC and resist due to the fact that Str, Dex and Agi don’t play a big roll after 1st level and keep it at a weight of  0.3 or less.<P>Skills: We need a low-end cap on our offence skills.<P>Bandages: Make spiderling silk drop like copper please and make the silk bandages heal 90 to 100 points. <P>Bind wound: Speed up our ability to bind. 3 bandages for monks to every 2 to any other class.<P>Sunken of the tranquil: Turn this in to Shrunken of returning with a reuse of 1 min or so.<P>As far as stats, below is wishful thinking.<P>Str: Make it so high str get rewarded with damage out put. I don’t like to see me hitting a mob for 1 point. Ie increase the low end damage.<P>Dex: Make it so high dex gets rewarded. You increase the proc or land a blow more oftin.<P>Agi: Make it so high agi gets rewarded. You dodge more oftin and increase AC. The AC bonus seems to drop off around 120 to 130, after that its almost pointless to have agi over 130.<P>For stats; I saw no diff with a 90 str and a 145 str for damage or landing blows. Same goes with other stats.<P>Over all in armor I would like to see better AC and resist across the board.

</FONT><HR>I don't know if this has been brought up, so forgive me if it is redundant.<BR>There are a lot of monks asking for increases to hand to hand damage post-50.  I think this is a very good idea.  However, even with our epic fists (supposedly the best monk weapon in the game, at least for the primary hand) we are still barely outdamaging well equipped warriors, or sometimes not outdamaging them at all.  What I would suggest is, along with raising damage on post-50 monk fists, the damage rating on the Celestial Fists raise at certain levels.  I don't know if this could be coded, but it would be some cool if it could.  Maybe a boost of one at level 55, one more at 58, and then again at 60, or something like that.  I haven't done the math involved, but it seems like it would address several issues.  Something to toss around.<P>Master Arikel Callistrae<BR>Erollisi Marr Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>--&gt; Stuns for monks - correcting some misinformation that has been posted so far.<P>Currently the only way for a monk to stun is to use the level 59 discipline - Silent Fist.  This discipline has a reuse time of 7 minutes at level 59 and 6 minutes at level 60. <P>Silent Fist is not an automatic stun: on the next Dragon punch that hits the opponent, there is a "chance" that it will stun them.<BR>--<BR>When dealing with the average fight, a monster may attempt to heal, gate, or cast significantly powerful spells upon you many times in a single battle. It becomes obvious that one chance to stun them per 6 minutes of gameplay is pretty limited in value.<P>All large races able to use slam may attempt a stun or casting interrupts roughly once every 6 seconds.  <P>At level 55, all warriors gain the ability to stun and interrupt with every single kick they do - also roughly one chance per 6 seconds.  <P>Warriors do not sacrifice anything for this innate ability, they use the same kick they have used throughout their careers, but now with a stun chance.<P>Many classes also have the option of equipping a shield to use the bash skill to attempt to stun or interrupt mobs.  This is a tradeoff in that they lose a sizeable chunk of damage output in order to gain a chance to interrupt spells.<P>--<BR>-Proposed Solution- <BR>At level 55, allow the "Round Kick" skill that monks gained at level 5 to gain the ability to interrupt casters.  The trade off here is apparent, as while the monk attempts to interrupt by using Round Kick, he is sacrificing his ability to be using the very powerful and higher damage "Flying Kick" skill that is the hallmark attack of the monk past level 30.<P>This solution would allow the monk the option of sacrificing significant damage output in order to gain the chance to interrupt spell casting monsters.  <P>The bottom line of this trade off is that the monk would be giving up a chance to kick for 100+ damage to instead kick for roughly 15 points of damage with a chance of interrupting a spell.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Monks need just a couple things IMO.<P>1# Fix FD the way it used to work pre Kunark. The way it is now its totally unreliable on mobs over 35. Its rediculous that you have to /q or zone to clear the hate list. If you have to zone your no different then any other class which kinda defeats the point of FD. If you don't zone or /q you may bring down the zone on your group, so you have to do it. This problem greatly reduces our role as the best pullers.<P>2# Restore Monks as the kings of melee. Make fists the best weapon in the game, as they used to be. Not just post 50 either, every level. As a 46 Monk I have always been outdamaged by Rogues, most Rangers and Warriors too. It was really bad pre 30. The problem is all these class's have alot of great weapons that you can get pretty cheap at low levels. Everyone has at least dual Yaks these days. I dont want more heavy weapons either, I want to use fists.<P>When balancing class's think about what a Monks role is. Its to fight period. Monks sacrifice EVERYTHING for the ability to fight. 14wt limit, low hit points,(For comparison my level 28 Ogre Warrior has about 50 more HPs then my 46 Monk).Monks don't get all kinds of stat, AC, or spell casting armor, and not many good obtainable weapons. There is no way Rogues should be regularly outdamaging Monks. Maybe once in awhile but not constantly. Rogues get all kinds of other skills that make them usefull to a group. Sneak/hiding into a dragons lair comes to mind. They can wear tons of cool equipment. (They have a helm that casts ultravision on the target for example.) They have awesome weapons, use poisons, bows, pick locks, pick pockets, actually carry some weight, the Rogue/Bard masks etc. They have many utility roles in a group, a Monks primary role is to do damage. Warriors are obviously the main damage sponge and can have some outragous criticals and crippling blows. Rangers have cool spells like sow, snare and camo. Monks just fight, and thats what I had in mind when I started one.<P>I would like the old punchs and kicks to be on a seperate timer. They should not be obsolete the moment you get the next skill. I would also like to see the power of the fists raised so Monks do not NEED the best weapons to be competitive with other class's damage with common weapons. Monks should also have a minimums on their punches and kicks as rogues have minimum backstabs. Flying kick should not be hitting for 3points of damage (It does alot), I would rather just miss altogether. <P>Damage, damage, damage, thats whats a Monks role is. It shouldn't even be close, Monks should do way more damage because of all the other things they sacrifice. ID is fine and I don't feel the need for taunt. Making one of the old punches stun would be nice to stop runners in dungeons though. Anyway, thats my 2cp on the issue after 2 years of EQ.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Perhpas the easiest way to raise monk melee damage while also being easily scalable would be to add an off-hand damage bonus that isn't as good as the primary but is a scaled verion of the primary.  Adding full primary bonus to the second hand is probably over kill but some lesser but reletive value would be just about right.<P>I do not really like the idea of unbinding all the specials to raise damage output as I am already running low on hot keys and having to hit all of them each time they come up or fill up my my hot key menu with special would just drive me nuts.<P>I like the idea of making lesser skills have other abilities as you gain levels to make them more useful however.  Adding a stun to kick would make me want to max it and doing a critical with eagle strike would be pretty neat (just a few possible examples).  I'm all for minimum damage on FK as it is supposed to be our damage dealing staple but it doesn't need anything extra applied to it.<P>The only other thing I would like to see changed are the issues with FD.  I like the idea of a discipline to clear agro that has a reletively short reuse time on it.  The only other FD issue I would like to see addressed is how it seems that if you are grouped and a member of your group is on a mobs agro list that your FD never seems to work... you just keep getting a beat down if the mob still hates you the most.  I'm not certain that this is the exact mechanic of this problem but that is my best guess from observation (you and group member on agro list).<P>Thats all I have for now=)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053593&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053593&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
