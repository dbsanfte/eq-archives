</FONT><HR>I've got a few ideas as well.  How about a Tashan DOT type spell.  Something where it's continually hammering at the MR of the critter (We could call it Rolling Taunt)  I would also like to have a few enchantment type spells (like "lighten" that would reduce the weight of an item by X% for a period of time, or "Damage Increase" on a weapon, possibly even a 10%-15% speed increase on footwear (Keep it small so as to not step on SOW).  As for enchanting, I'm REALLY waiting on this, but PLEASE don't make the items no rent, If I wanted no rent magical items, I'd get a mage to summon stuff.  And finally to Absor, Thanks for allowing us some feedback!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Maybe you could add some real benefit to having a religion, such as some new spells.  Maybe the spells could be deity-specific.<P>For example, if you follow Tunare you get a nature-oriented spell (no idea what this should be).  Or maybe you get a new series of spells (3 or 4 spells, maybe).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>this will probably get shot down in flames, but I have to add this as there is a bit of logic to it.<P>ENC pets are warriors for the most part,... however<P>they do not get nearly the hp, nor the combat ability of a warrior.<P>Mage, necro, shaman pets are controlable<BR>Mage, necro pets acquire magical abilities at higher lvl's (including backstab:necro pet)<P>all pets get taunt, kick(even though mage pets have no legs) bash and can dual wield at a certain point.<P>at higher lvl's enc pets have no unique combat ability whatsoever.<P>if they are classed as a warrior (logic in this is when you kill an NPC enc pet you get a weapon and shield that are both warrior only items) then they should get, at higher lvl's some warrior combat skills<BR>perhaps a low occurance crit stike, or crippling blow when their just about to buy the farm.<BR>Riposite, double attack, ect...<BR>just my two copper pieces on that one.<P>another possible change is to our color line of spells.<BR>we have a ton of spells, too many in fact to have all the spells we would like to use during combat mem'd <BR>a % chance to mem blurr attached to our color line spells would be fantastic as when mez'ing mobs alot of times the only way to get the critter under mez again is to stun it, alot of times, it doesn't always work cause we've caused aggro from mez'ing in the first place<BR>I know our lvl 50+ color spells have a built in (debuff or mana drain I forget which it is exactly) <P>point one:<BR>mobs that have mana all have Mega mana pools and draining an infantecimal amount of mana off a mob is of little use.<P>Point two:<BR>Debuffs to STR and Int/Wis have no effect<BR>(and before you start to tell me that they do, i've tested it thouroughly, they don't, a lvl 2 mob debuffed by a lvl 50+ enc still does the same amount of damage, the same is true of a lvl 35 and so on.<BR>mana sieve curse of the simple mind ect. have no effect on mobs either, draining mana or lowering INT/Wis doesn't stop mobs from casting<BR>{tested on a casting Dervish Cutthroat: 7 mana sieves 1 curse of the simple mind 2 theft of thought all while it was mezed, mob casted as normal, this occurance happened on any mob this was tested on.})<P>so the side effect of our color line of spells at lvl 50+ are useless effects.<P>I know this thread was addressed to some degree but I feel strongly enough about it to make my thoughts known.<P>Mez Vs. Giant Kin/Dragon Kin<BR>it's an excellent idea that one person had to prevent the casting of mez/stunn on mobs that cannot be mez'd/stuned<BR>(note: color line of spells although they don't say the mob is immune to the spell they don't stun Giant kin/Dragon kin. the only effect is when dealing with a casting variety of these critters, it interrupts them.)<BR>(note: additionally Whirl till you hurl and Dynn's doesn't work on them either, there is no message that they are immune it simply breaks a split second after casting it)<BR>As a die hard ENC player, I feel frustrated when dealing with certain areas dominated by Giant kin/dragon kin my abilities in group are non existant<BR>Naggy Raid non of my normal attempts to crowd control were of any effect<BR>Skyfire Raid again I was useless when it came to helping the group I was with.<P>I would like to see some spell that would allow us to mez/stun a giant kin/dragon kin mob other wise we have little effectiveness there.<BR>or,....<BR>fix the spells that do not have the "your target is immune" message so they can be used as an effective tactic for crowd control<BR>ie.. Whirl and Dynn's and our Color line of spell<BR>currently they are two lines of spells that althought don't have a "your target is immune" message also don't have any effect.<P>Bards:<BR>Bards are annoying (there I said it)<BR>make that damn song of theirs not show up in our targetters so I can crowd control without them always being in my face.<BR>often times a tank will pull several mobs,<BR>often they are all huddled together, I use our color line to chain stun and mez them one by one<BR>but with a bard in the group I wind up trying to mez them rather than the mob when they are playing.<BR>please fix this it's annoying.<BR>(personally I don't think they should have temp buff icons as they are not perm buffs)<P>Stackability:<BR>Shaman line of Taliman of "XXX" i'm sure all spell casters can agree on this one.<BR>although the shaman's talisman is more hp than our magi shield spell it lowers our ac and magic reistance even if it's of higher lvl it still overwrites it. please make it so dumb arse shamans can't overwrite our shielding.<P>Bard song (dunno what it called, don't care) the one that regens mana,...<BR>IF: if the bard is higher lvl than the enchanter<BR>Then: clarity/II won't stack<BR>Else: bard has to stop playing for the enchanter to reinstate clarity/II<P>Bard's song is "temporary" as subject to their continued playing to keep the effect in play.<P>I. their song should not take priority to a "permanent buff" no matter how high they are.<P>II. they shouldn't have an icon displayed while playing, it only serves to disorganize my permanent buffs and puts hole in them.<BR>ie... I cast all my buffs in a very specific order, mainly due to the fact I have so many (11 to be exact)<BR>if one falls and the bard is playing, their temp icon fits itself in the open spot where my normal buff goes.<BR>call it anal retentive, I don't care, but it's annoying and as such I refuse to group with bards due to this.<P>More illusions?<BR>yeah sure I don't mind more illusions but how about fixing the ones we already have first<BR>Illusion Skeleton/dry bone are in theory supposed to give base faction with undead<BR>that can't be farthur from the truth.<BR>Illusion skeleton only is effective in Sol A as it give you an Indifferent standing with Goblins there (that make sense to you???)<BR>in Unrest the only illusion that grants Indifferent standing is Illusion Spirit wolf<BR>(a wolf is indifferent to undead??? ok your not on drugs are you)<BR>Illusion Spirit wolf and Wearwolf both grant higher attack problem is I haven't wielded a weapon since lvl 24 and i'm 54 now.<BR>do I think that illusion spirit wolf should offer a marginal travel speed boost like with Jboots?.... Hell yeah<BR>as far as the wearwolf one goes, only use i've seen for that spell is scaring the hell outa newbies in zones where wearwolves are found.<P>the elemental illusions are the only "functional" illusions I have so far<BR>Air offers levitation (but your KOS to FV)<BR>Fire offers a Damage shield (now stacks with our DS spell)<BR>Earth offers more Strength (no other effect than that saddly enough)<BR>Water grants Enduring breathe untill the illusion is cancelled (very useful)<P>oh yeah and before I forget my biggest beef:<BR>why is it that enchanters can produce magical jewelry but not weapons and armour (yeah sure I know the new armours blah blah blah, i'm an erudite no racial armour for us =P)<BR>only class that can produce magic weapons are mages, (don't make sense to me at all)<BR>Why is it ENC's when we do get some form of new spell the spell has to be put in the most rediculous places<P>case in point Thicken mana series (still no use for these spells unless your a monk with bad taste in armour) sold at the brownie camp in Lfey, they hate everyone (thank goodness for elemental illusion(lvl 24 before you can get near them to buy your lvl 12 spell)<BR>Imbue Fire Opal, only way to get this spell is <BR>A) kill nagafin wait for the vendor to spawn with the spell <BR>B) hope you have someone religeous to Solusek Ro to purchase it for you.<BR>was that really nesessary???,.... not really.<BR>Illusion Iksar spell (quest) first item on the list is Nok shaman dust, ok the spell is lvl 20, but the first component for the spell is surrounded by mobs that were blue to me at lvl 40.<BR>a little harse.<BR>I tried to get this item at lvl 52, nearly got my arse handed to me on a silver platter, and the mobs were all green to me at this point.<BR>needless to say I still don't have this spell<BR>suggestion, put a bit more thought into where you put our spells, we're getting the impression you loathe us or something.<BR>personally Lguk should also drop this dust since there are similar mobs there as well as in FV.<P>one more little thing before I close this thread.<P>ENC evocation spells<BR>All or no damage<BR>low damage for mana ratio<BR>Nasty mega taunt<BR>only DD type spell we have.<P>if your going to keep them low on the damage/mana ratio and all or nothing.<BR>do all of us a favor can you nix the mega taunt tanks have a hard enough time keeping a mob on them without outside taunters.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>#1 Do NOT change the illusions dropping on zone.<BR>Scenario:<P>Enchanter is bound in Freeport. He/she runs over to Neriak, casts Illusion: Dark Elf so he/she can run around the city and buy spells. Finishes her business and gates out. <BR>With current illusion drop on zone, enchanter is safe in Freeport when he/she arrives, since Illusion DE is no longer active. <BR>If Illusions stay active on zone, then enchanter is instantly KoS in Freeport due to DE illusion. <BR>Dropping Illusion while still in Neriak defeats the purpose of having the Illusion, and you would then be fair game and KoS to everyone in Neriak.<P>(all above is assuming you are not a DE enchanter to begin with, reverse situation otherwise)<P>Things like the masks which create an illusion probably should continue despite the character zoning... they're still wearing the mask, aren't they? Although I'm sure most people wouldn't like that changed if the enchanter line wasn't.<P>#2 Pet spell vendors.<P>I'm a lvl 8 enchanter and I need my new pet spell. I have to run all the way to HighKeep to buy my pet spell? This doesn't make any sense to me. Granted I get invisibility and technically I should be able to easily make it to HighKeep, but it's a long haul from anywhere on Faydwer or even Odus, and we all know how reliable invis is...besides, by now shouldn't some other library have copies of these?  <BR>Other spell casters don't have to travel that far to get their spells until they're at least in their late teens in level...and if the arguement is that I have illusions to help me get there, well, that's a pile of steaming poop. There are no cities I have to go through to get there, and the only illusions I have at lvl 8 are minor illusion (immobile), Half Elf, Human, Gnome and Wood Elf. None of those will help me run past the lvl 30 griffons in the Karanas or past the undead nasties in Kithicor. Oh yes, even if I could get invis to hold up, it is useless in Kithicor, and that place is scary as hell for a lvl 25 character, nevermind a lvl 8 one.<P>At the very least the library in Erudin should have the animation spells. Perhaps that will even encourage a few people to hang around in the otherwise vacant continent. (The Hole does not count since that is a playground only for those lvl 40+)<P>#3 The Thicken Mana series. See above. I still have not gone to the brownie camp to retrieve this spell for fear of being slaughtered by lvl 45+ brownies. Is it really necessary to guard a lvl 12 spell thus?<P><BR>thalia..why are you even playing an enchanter? first of all click OFF your illusion if you are that worried about it..2ndly get your pet like everyone else and suck it up. its only distance. and thirdly...why dont you try turning into an elemental and getting by thoes brownie guards..<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

They are needed and they are the ones that grant us a place in every group. We need that place, for theres not much we can do alone. We CAN control mobs. We can make em stand still infinetily, spin them around and even control them. But we dont get experience for that. We get EXP if that thing is dead before us. And that is the one thing we CANT achieve alone, at least not with ANY mob of the same lvl, except bats and firebeetles. Its running and praying and cursing most of the time. Waiting 5secs for that damned icon to show again, so you can cast again and do a sliver more dmg. Seeing your charm breaking after every 2 secs. Seeing another thing join the battle and to know there is NOTHING you can do to save your pet, and even have troubles saving your live, let alone kill that thing, for at the end of mana there´s always a terrific amount of monster left. <P>I had a lvl 27 Necro yesterday. Didnt play him for a while, but he´s lvl 30 today. After all the struggle and fight to solo with the enchanter its relaxing to play a POWERfull class that can start the battle, know that it will survive no matter what, for blue mobs are BLUE, they cant kill them. Seeing some stupid thing join the fight and taking a step back, let the pet hold it a sec and cast 2 blasts, let the pet finish it of and concentrate on the main enemy again, that was no threat for it was slowed (darkness). Casting live draw once or twice to make up for the loss of HPs while medding and fighting, see the Mob die, take your pet and go to the meding place, no hassle, no danger, just you and your god like power, granted by the evil paths you walk upon...<P>Borrow the acount of a friend absor, or create a Enchanter of that lvl and try the same... You might learn something and you will NEVER AGAIN tell us we´re overpowered.<BR> <P>I dont think I have ever heard (read) it expressed so true to the fact as what I just read above. Absor, this is as true as it gets. We NEED groups and contrary to popular belief they are not all just waiting for an enchanter. I spent 30-45 min last night getting a group in DL and the only reason I got a group then was because I was bored and started buffing the heck out of them for free and I guess they felt bad so they invited me. so after a couple hours, I got a buble of exp, not a total loss I guess.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Please stop asking for the removal of the Lute of the Howler - it drops off of a level 58 encounter and as such will be seen by sooo few bards. Please, by all means, have more illusions after 44! Don't ever give them to me on an item! But don't take away what has already been given.<BR>Also I saw someone saying that clarity/cantana "should either stack or not" - in regards to us having to stop it for clarity to be cast. If cantana was made to not stack with clarity, then it would be a huge nerf. Other than that - go chanters!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Read most of the last 16 pages, not much more to add except for the stuff I have some thoughts on...<P>1) To those who believe we should receive extra abilities from illusions... I strongly believe we should NOT receive any it just serves to dilutes the classes even further (eg SOW of any level with wolf form, regen with troll etc). I for one do not want to become more self sufficient, I want us to be as much part of a group as much as non-velious (hehe) groups want us.<P>The exception to these are air/water/fire elemental as we can achieve these effects via other spells anyway and reduces the tedious nature of casting a second spell to achieve the same effect.<P>2) Illusions should drop when you zone (its usually safe to just recast it just after you zone in from experience if you are in a dangerous zone) or die, but NOT when logging or linkdeath (most other spells dont drop why should illusions?).<P>One thing which is more useful than class balancing is to change the duration of our self only 'fun' illusions to be permanent until you zone or cancel. It just removes the tedium of recasting the spell every 30mins or whatever... could be wrong but dont think it impacts balance too much.<P>3) Can something be done to our pure strength debuff line on normal mobs? This entire spell line has lots of potential but is currently not used alot as it seems to have negliable effect. <P>I'm not sure what exactly it's original intended effect was meant to be, so more information from Verant about this line of spells would be good.<P>My thoughts would be to have it have a permanent percentage damage reduction in damage taken, which scales up with each upgrade. Or if that is too unbalancing maybe have it have a percentage chance of causing the mob to do a critical miss where the mob would normally have a chance to attack but doesnt and misses it's attack round, and a message is displayed like 'Mob is too weak to attack'.<P>4) Been said earlier but our WTYH and DDD spells are broken to easily. I understand why these spells were toned down originally, but maybe too late in the day now but maybe rather than have a stun component have it cause an increase of a mob missing when it attacks (the mobs are meant to be spinning around afterall).<P>5) Also been said but we get hit ALOT (via our megataunt spells) and I think something needs to be done to offset this. Either by as someone else said increase the taunt caps of melee classes or create more enchanter only items (ac/hp or ac/cha combos).<P>6) Also been said but please make religion something worthwhile to invest in. Creating a mask to hide religion is only admitting agnostic is the only real way to go for enchanters.<P>7) Been a long time ago (but still sticks in my mind) and I think someone mentioned it before but the lvl20 pet is a real real weak one.<P><BR>Dont want to rant on but thanks for listening.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>How about at level 60 there is an Uber magic debuff.  Something that strips mobs with insane mr down to the level that magic based spells can stick.

</FONT><HR>"I dont think I have ever heard (read) it expressed so true to the fact as what I just read above. Absor, this is as true as it gets. We NEED groups and contrary to popular belief they are not all just waiting for an enchanter. I spent 30-45 min last night getting a group in DL and the only reason I got a group then was because I was bored and started buffing the heck out of them for free and I guess they felt bad so they invited me. so after a couple hours, I got a buble of exp, not a total loss I guess."<P>I'm not sure what server you're on friend, but you will always see "/ooc North Wall group looking for bard or enchanter" about every 10 minutes or so provided there aren't 40 of em already in zone on the Prexus server.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
