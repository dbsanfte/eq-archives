</FONT><HR><BR>***Patch Day***<P>*General Changes*<P>-- Doubled the chance gain skill points in skills that are above 200. <BR>-- Fixed a bug that disallowed casting of the Donal's Breatplate on others once casted upon yourself.<BR>-- The spell scrolls for Grim Aura should now all reflect usability by SKs<BR>-- Fixed a bug that would allow melee players to open a spellbook via /book or alt+b.<BR>-- Merchants will now recognize Iksar as a valid race.<BR>-- New bind locations have been added to three zones in the world - One on Antonica and two others on Kunark.  NPCs at these locations can fill you in on the details.  Good hunting.<BR>-- The casting time for four cleric brestplates sporting the "Celestial Healing" effect has been increased to one minute.  We understand that this severely limits the use of that effect and we are currently discussing alternate effects to place on those items in the next patch.  We did, however, need to address the 300pt per tick regen that could be placed and kept on the group tank.  When we've decided on the new affect, it will be applied to those items retroactively.  <BR>-- Numeric skill values will be shown on character skill display for skill values over 100.  Values under 100 still show the qualitative identifiers.<BR>-- Players have expressed concern about accidentally inspecting other players.  You can now turn on or off your ability to inspect other players by typing /inspect. <BR>-- Those of you with z-axis mouse wheels on your mice may use them over the chat window.<BR>-- Fixed "Breath of the Sea". It was mistakenly set to be unresistable.<BR>-- Same-zone evac-type spells will now cause you to reload the current zone.  This is a necessary step to ensure that you are removed from all hatelists and clean up your pet.<BR>-- "Voice Graft" will no longer show the spawn number (Jobaber00) of your pet.<BR>-- You will now receive a message when you are being bandaged.<BR>-- The tracking skill cap for Druids has been raised to 125.  It was the intent for druids to be better at tracking than they were, however before the scroll bar, smaller skill numbers were often considered better.  With the tracking improvements from the last patch, this increase was appropriate.<BR>-- Increased the number of hitpoints healed by Celestial Cleansing.<P>*NPC AI Adjustments*<P>-- Level 60 players with the taunt skill will now have a chance to taunt creatures that are level 60 to 65.  Previously, players could only taunt creatures below their level.<BR>-- NPCs that are mesmerized or stunned will now only add a very small amount of hate when they see you cast beneficial spells on their enemies.  Prior to this, they would add full hate when they saw you do this.  This is why NPCs would always jump the cleric after breaking Mez.<BR>-- Fixed a bug that would cause NPCs to add too much "temporary hate" when a player would sit down in front of them.<BR>-- The maximum amount of "hate" that an NPC can add when witnessing a heal to targets above level 50 has been decreased substantially.<BR>-- Hate from heals is also now calculated at a lesser number than the number of hitpoints healed.  Previously, healing one hitpoint would cause one point of hate.  Now, healing 3 hitpoints will cause 2 points of hate.<P>*Velious Music*<P>Velious subscribers should run the Velious Patch to pick up new mood music for some Velious Zones.  Let us know what you think of the new compositions. <P>*EQGems*<P>A new "mini-game" has been added to the EverQuest client.  EQGems is our first effort aimed towards allowing people to engage in different activities while playing EverQuest.  Based upon the success of EQGems, we may explore opportunities for other mini-games in the future, even some that are multiplayer in and of themselves.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Some interesting changes here...<P>I'm a bit concerned with this one:  "Same-zone evac-type spells will now cause you to reload the current zone. This is a necessary step to ensure that you are removed from all hatelists and clean up your pet."<P>Since the last patch that "fixed" problems with people crashing while zoning, a lot of people I know, including myself, have actually seen a huge increase of crashing while zoning (I either require ctrl-alt-del, end up on the desktop, or end up at the server select screen, even when camping -- all connection with my world server is lost).  This could render the mage Call of Hero spell useless as it only works with grouped players.  One common use of this spell is for the wizard in your group to same-zone self evac, add the new people, and then the mage summons.  With increased zone crashing, there is a huge risk added (beyond game dynamics) to using this spell.  With an 80% crash rate for a lot of people, this is bad.<P>Secondly, CoH is designed to wipe the hate list when you summon a player.  Was this considered a "same-zone" evac type spell?  If so, you've removed one of the few uses a mage has on a high level encounter.  Summoning players to remove hate is saving clerics from the increased hate, saving enchanters from the still rediculous tash hate, etc.  By adding zoning time to it, you'd be removing them from battle by an uncontrolled time period (dependant on internet connection speed, computer speed, not crashing, etc) to this very useful tactic.  These are not factors which should normally be considered a balancing feature.  If CoH was not considered a "same-zone" evac type spell, why couldn't you just add the same code to these evac spells that CoH already uses.  It seems to work most of the time, which would be fair for evac spells as well.<P>This one has me laughing:  "Players have expressed concern about accidentally inspecting other players. You can now turn on or off your ability to inspect other players by typing /inspect"<P>Do you realize how long players have been asking for this?  I'm so happy to see it added, yet I'm wondering what took you guys so long?  <P>This one has me puzzled:  "NPCs that are mesmerized or stunned will now only add a very small amount of hate when they see you cast beneficial spells on their enemies. Prior to this, they would add full hate when they saw you do this. This is why NPCs would always jump the cleric after breaking Mez"<P>How did you come to this conclusion?  As an enchanter, I can tell you that after a mez is broke I have seen the formally mezed mob attack one of two players, either the enchanter or the tank.  I can not remember a single instance of a mob jumping the cleric.  I don't see anything wrong with this change, but you guys need to check your sources better when deciding what should be fixed sooner than later.<P>Lastly, Gems...Why not fix bugs, or find ways to reduce down time rather than finding a downtime distraction.  This is such an admittance by you guys that perhaps EQ has too much downtime built in to it.  This is not a solution, this is avoiding the issue.<P>Oh well...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Couple of notes, A numeric value for skills over 100 is long over do and I'm very happy to see it added.<BR>Increased chance for skill increase post 200 will be nice, It might seem a little unfair to the less than 1% of the server population who have managed to max their specialized trade skill but oh well, My specialized Skill fletching costs 220pp per attempt for something that takes days to sell I look forward to maybe seeing a point increase beyond 202 one of these days.<BR>The inspect issue is just dumb. save for on PVP I don't see what everyones problem with it is. Inspect is no different than looking at the person your inspecting kind of like if I were to look at you and go oh your wearing blue jeans. <BR>It seems that the biggest problem was just the message itself. What VI should have done is to have made the /inspect toggle the variable in your eqini that turns off the suchnsuch is inspecting you message.<BR>BTW if you see me about feel free to inspect, as long as it's not on a pvp server it doesn't bother me at all. And I think all the people who get worked up over it are idiots.<BR>Next the adjustments to the hate generated by heal should be nice but we'll just have to see how it works in game and whether it is enough to save clerics in the post 50 game. Personally at 42nd my ranger can still taunt enough to allow a cleric to safely cast CH.<BR>On the bind locations first let me point out that EJ is a very unlikely candidate since CoM is already a bindable zone. Still it will be intersting to see where the new bind points are. The first thing I note however is where a new bind point will not be. Velious. Velious as far as I know has one meele bind spot which is the dwarven city. This to me seems very unfair to any evil character who wishes to work Giant faction they are left with no bind point. Also on the team PVP servers you end up with no reasonably safe bind point for the Dark team. This should be addressed by VI.<BR>As a Ranger I'm non to happy about the increase in the Druids tracking ability, I mean I can understand why VI would want Druids to out track better than Bards (personally I never thought it was appropriate for a bard to track in the first place a Rogue seemed more appropraite if they just had to give our class defining ability to someone else at least then the Dark team would have a tracking class) However the question is how much of a difference is the extra 75 skill points we have over them make, Basically it just means that if we start at the same spot I should spot the mob earlier. Maybe its because VI has never felt the need to quantify what the extra tracking points mean other than a rather abstract statement about increased range. Also the justification rubs me raw<BR>"-- The tracking skill cap for Druids has been raised to 125. It was the intent for druids to be better at tracking than they were, however before the scroll bar, smaller skill numbers were often considered better. With the tracking improvements from the last patch, this increase was appropriate."<BR>So this means prior to fixing tracking it was perfectly acceptable to Verant that Druids out tracked Rangers. Now the filters and sort commands we get do give us a little edge however one more would be useful and would put Rangers back in the place of King of Tracking /track (named) sure we'd be getting tells all the time to track stuff but at least then we would have a skill that would make us desirable in certain circumstances.<BR>The music I turn down anyway (distracts from important sounds like getting hit) <BR>You want to do something useful with the sounds make an all aboard fog horn sound for a boat ariving at the dock or shuttles about to depart so I don't end up stuck at the dock for an extra hour because I happened to look away from my PC for a minute at the wrong time.<BR>Gem seems pretty useless.<P>Oh well that's my oppinion so far.<BR>and /gem seems like a silly addition.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok here are my 2 cents about this patch and EQ in general:<P>The Patch seems ok to me in general even if enhancements for the classes that got none yet are not includued yet. Also I hope that if Fear and Hate change the drops will be no longer of a special mob in a special plane but will be random. Makes no sense for me that a SK gets full set just with 1 visit and other classes need 20 visits and have still stuff missing. Also quite a lot of the planar armour pieces are almost useless - especially when you compare it with Velious mid lvl stuff.<P>When you think about it without prejudice you have to agree that Verant is doing a great job listening to customers and enhancing game with patch over patch compared to other games. Sometimes it seems to me that when it comes to the favourite computer games people go crazy about everything (made my experience as board-moderator for a european division of very well known publisher...) <BR>Still we got no response on the PvP discussion and about a possible Good vs Evil Server for weeks but seems that the cleric problems are more important to them what is sad but still ok for me...<P>In general I want to say that for the high end encounters the difficulty should not be set too high because in a guild with 40+ active players there will usually start trouble because some members don't like each other too much. If you do raids together with other guilds there usually starts a long loot debate. The Question is if you plan to make the game for all harder (and putting most of the Ubr gear out of range for all classes) because less than 5% of the players can kill almost all mobs. Makes more sense to me to have a few very hard zones where only the most skilled and best equipped players can hunt but not to make the game difficult for all players. Remember there are also players who don't have 40+ hours to play per week. My personal opinion is that by reducing the xp modificators - allowing the people to level a bit faster 50+ (with 54+ taking forever I no longer log on to make xp but just for raids and stuff because I am tired of spending all my time just to make a pixel xp) you won't loose players because there is enough to do at 60 (or you have done a mistake with designing the game) like raids and playing twinks and so on... <P>Well .. I am talking too much - let's say it short: Verant is on the right way - hope they continue doing a great job and listen to the players.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Kael is a "city" or at least parts of it are.  I know for a fact that you can be bound near the merchant area.  Skyshrine is another bindable zone, for those on Dragon faction.
