&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>This is not a cry about the Donal's Breastplate nerfing, this is not a call to get it undone.  The Donal's breastplate issue has merely shed a light on a long developing problem.  Mudflation - you know the term, you know the syndrome.  Please take a step back and look at the history of the bleeding edge of EQ.<P>The battle between the developers to challenge the elite players and the elite players to "beat" the game in EQ has been a long one.  It's really been happening since the very beginning, but started to get heated when the first big guilds begain to kill the dragons regularly.  Initially, only a tiny, tiny amount of guilds on any server were able to kill dragons - the results were twofold. First, these guilds ended up harvesting the dragons regularly, having minimal competition, and as such because more than well equipped with loot that was above and beyond anything available to the rest of the populace.  Second, the better equipped they got, the better tactically they got, the stronger the dragons were made.  The "bar" started to get raised for these people, yet the rest of the population was NOT rising as fastly - only those capable of killing the dragons were doing so, and only they were starting to equip themselves with the items that were making them powerful enough to justify the increased difficulty of the dragons.<P>Then the planes open, and the spark of mudflation that started with the dragons exploded on both fronts.  Fear (later Hate), a vast new zone of such difficulty that it challenged those already boosted far above their lesser brethren with the loot won from dragons, but also filled with loot of astounding potence, making the dragon stuff look like junk in comparison.  Soon, the same guilds that were harvesting the dragons were now harvesting planar armor and equipment, god loot at the time almost unimagineably good.  These guilds buried themselves in the bounty, not just themselves but their alts/twinkies/mules...  Those that couldn't, which was pretty much all but one to three guilds per server, weren't... The mighty got mightier, the devs responded, killed drop rates AND made the planes more difficult.  And more so.. and more so... and the drop rates got lower.. and lower.. Those who were there first, already a class above the rest of the populace due to their hordes of dragon loot were now even further ahead, bedecked in full planar gear.  <P>In time, many many more guilds became strong enough to kill the dragons, venture into the planes, but it was not the same.. dragons were tougher, rather than one guild dominating every spawn, or two or three battling over them, it was many, many guilds fighting over two dragons.  The planes were not the same places.. those who were there first still dominated and swept them at will, the rest were stuck bickering with eachother over the scraps, scraps coincidentally which were far tougher to kill than what the initial plane pioneers faced and far poorer in reward than they once were.  The elite first ones were decked down to their mules in full or near full suits of planar armor, only needing to harvest more as new members joined, or new alts were born, the rest were struggling to get entire guilds full of people a scrap or two of the planar goodies... It was ugly..<P>Then Kunark came out.. and the promises had us all excited - a handfull of new dragons, not just the two old perpertually slaughtered duo of Nagafen and Vox.. whole zones for the 40+ crowd to play in..  but what do we see?  The new dragons are so powerful only the initial harvesters of vox/nag and the planes had a chance to kill them - new, wonderful armors and equipment, but the prize pieces, the breastplates and leggings, where were they.. Trakanon and Venril Sathir...  and to whom were they available.. drumroll.. the same people who were there to first harvest vox and nagafen, that small small percentage of the populace in that small small subset of guilds.  This was where the mudflation had gotten out of hand, where the barrier between the haves and the have not finally cemented itself.  To this date, how many guilds per server have killed Trakanon, how many have killed Venril Sathir?  Short of ebay and the VERY RARE trade, this same number is the number of guilds who have obtained Donal's breastplates, or other such Kunark right clickable class armor breastplates.  And this is what, TEN months after Kunark's release?  Let's not even mention Veeshan's peak..<P>Now we have Velious - while Kunark was a bandaid for overcrowding, the factions an utter mess (Venril Sathir faction?  jeez.. what a horrible mess, where was that deep storyline it was supposed to be a part of), the quest content largely empty and/or broken, the zones well.. sloppy, and incoherent, without a finished feel, many dungeons still devoid of players.. well, while Kunark was a bandaid, Velious was obviously designed with love - deep, interesting, rewarding quests, a beautiful (at surface) faction triangle with a storyline behind it... but it was not designed with the average player in mind.  The faction triangle while initially accessible to the majority of players hits a wall when you get to the royal factions - the quests available to the average player, well, what few raise tormax or yelinak faction do so minimally - given that we start at scowls the quests might as well not even give faction, they won't be of use.  How do we raise faction with the royal factions of Kael, the Dragons?  Easy.. kill the royals of their enemies - who can do such things?  Ding!  Only that tiny tiny subset of guilds who have been on top from the beginning (though they might have changed faces, names, reformed and redistributed the players among them, it's still that same small handful of people at the heart).  The rest of us?  Out of the loop, scrounging for scraps in Great Divide and Eastern Wastes...  And what about all those wonderful zones for high level players?  Well, they're only for high level players who can get through Siren's Grotto.. and those high level players well.. ding, you got it, back to the same handfull of guilds per server..<P>Finally we get to the heart of this Donal's breastplate thing...  You finally admit that you are designing content around this one item, granted as per your admission, only a handfull of boss mobs were specifically made with this in mind, but it's time you look at all of velious, all top level content, and look in a mirror and ask yourself, really, who are you designing it for?  There are a LOT of players level 50+, but is this 50+ content designed for them?  I say the answer is clearly no, it is designed for only what amounts to an aristocratic minority of them, a miniscule subset who, while outstanding in their accomplishments is a tiny, tiny, tiny percentage of the whole population.<P>This is not an attack on uberguilds - they are not some evil organization out to get the rest of the player population, they are people, just like the rest of the player base, people, players who take what has been layed out before them, and use the tools that they have earned to take advantage of it.  It is not their fault that the content is skewed in their favor, they don't make the content, they just play the game.<P>The problem here lies clearly with you, the designers.  You seem to have blinded yourselves to the actual makeup of the player base.  I don't know why it has happened, but that it has happened is painfully clear.  If anyone Brad, given your long history and well respected knowledge in the arena of MUD type games, you should have been aware of the threat of mudflation, prepared for it, but clearly somehow, some way, Everquest has truly fallen victim to it.  Get a grip on the problem, and throttle it, get back in touch with those of us who play the game.  Not just the few lucky ones who figured things out at the beginning, organized themselves well enough to consistently stand at the pinnacle of success in the game, but the rest of us, who, less organized, less driven, have been basically struggling along, wallowing in the wake of the bleeding edge elite created by your efforts to challenge them without sight of or consideration for the rest of us.  Retune, revamp the 50+ content for the average 50+ player, group, guild, disorganized band of ruffians, whatever they may be, not the elite.  If they win, if they "beat" the content you created, good for them - it's not a defeat for you, the more happy players you have the more you win, content which only a small subset of the population will ever truly enjoy is not a victory, it's a defeat, a loss of vision.  Get back in touch with us, please.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is EXACTLY the problem.<P>And when Verant actually does "playtest", instead of just continually buffing stuff for that ultra-small fraction of top players, they hook up all there characters in the equipment that the uberguilds have.<P>What Verant has to realize is that almost NOONE has this gear.  A character decked out in a complete suit of Planar/Kunark/Dragon gear is EXTREMELY RARE.  This isn't your 'typical' 50+ player.<P>So re-test these zones, giving your players REASONABLE equipment when you do the test.  Leave a few encounters for the uberguilds, but don't cater to them (aka Velious).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>/applaud Bogmog<P>Excellent post!<P>When I first set foot on Velious, I was SO excited!  A lovely new place to play, without the Kunark Lag (tm) and dungeons pre-set to a prohibitive faction for my ogress!<P>It was only a matter of a few days before I realized that I would never see a good half of the continent, because I'm not "uber."  *sigh*<P>Like you, I'm not against uberguilds per se.  I admire their organizational and strategic abilities.  However, I'll never belong to one, because while I admire their military precision, I also abhor the rude and supercilious attitudes that so often are the mark of the average uberguildie.<P>Oh, well.

</FONT><HR>I have been getting that same exact feeling for some time now.  The game is being nerfed, balanced, designed with the uber encounters envolved.  It is realy starting to make me wonder how long I should keep playing.  It seems that any new expansions/patches are not going to geared toward my play style.  I feel like my play style is in the majority.  Also I have noticed that complaints of bugs or broken something or other are not listened to unless it comes from someone uber.  I remember Abashi stating once that if pets were broken then someone would have posted logs, stats, encounters showing this to be true.  Becuase they had not it must not be broken.  Translation - Only someone at least semi uber would have logs and numbers stored on their computer to be able to come up with such things.<P>May not be true but I would think majority of the players feel that it is.<P>What can be done though, it is their game.  They can cator to anyone they please.  If they balanced the game for the majority of the people then the uber would have it easier.  At least in theory.  This does not bother me but it is obvious it bother Verant.<P>Okay I am ranting again.<P>Balductum... ¥</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well I took the time to read all of this and all I can say is boo hoo.  I have four different chars that I play and the oldest is only 19 (ranger named Jarlax).  Now it is true that I am not that old, but I still can see the post for what it is...a whine!  <BR>One of the things that I like most about EQ is all the unique items that are out there.  I don't want everyone to be able to get all the great and powerful items.  Then they simply would not be so great anymore.  I mean you complaign that only certain "tiny" groups are able to go and kill certain things and achieve certain goals.  Well good!  I don't want just any player to be able to do everything, where is the challenge in that?  <BR>Has the game evolved and gotten harder?  Yes.  But if you don't like that then you should not be playing an on-line game.  It is the nature of the beast.  VI found weaknesses in the game and fixed them adding more challenge.  <BR>The point is simple.  Play well and make friends.  When you play well people remember you.  When you make friends people remember you.  So when you do both, say with someone in this "tiny" minority you talk about, you will have a chance to join them.  Accept the challenge and move on with your character.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Bogmog got it right. EQ got it wrong. The first MMOG that gets it right will terminate EQ. <P>The issue isn't class balance (a good design would have skill trees, not classes), nor is it an issue about the so-called uber-guilds. The issue is why should the player who leveled more slowly than the leading edge players face a more difficult Nagafen or Vox, or Hate, or Fear? The issue is what has Verant done with the world design to address the leading edge players which prevented making the game more fun and rewarding for the other 90% of the players?<P>I've been on both sides. I've been with the "uber" guilds that take down gods and dragons and VS with ease. I've been with the small guilds that can only place individuals into raids infrequently. And they live in very different worlds. <P>My real question is did Verant intend to create a different gaming experience, indeed a disparity in the richness of said experience, which is based on /played ? If the answer is yes, lets hope EQ is superceded by a better MMOG soon.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This post is SO good, that I'm almost positive it will get passed over without mention. I'm also at the end of my ropes, and I have been playing EQ since day one. Almost 300 days played between my 2 characters. Every time I get around 50 I feel compelled to quit, and end up starting other characters. This should not be. I just hate how the game turns into uber raids. This is POOR game design. There has to be an alternative. There has to be more content for ONE SOLID GROUP of players. ( 6 man party ) not 40+ people to tackle one mob. Some of the random drops in zones like POG are a step in the right direction IMO, and they need to do more of this.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Very well said.  However, let's not just think about the 50+ game.  How about the rest of us who will probably never even reach 50 due to playing time restraints.  How about some interesting content that the 50- players can enjoy?<P>People tend to get short-sighted when they get intot he higher game and forget what it was like to be 30 and wandering from place to place that has mobs that are too hard and loot that is terrible.<P>It's not just the 50+ game that needs to be retuned, it's the whole damn thing.<P>How many quests are there that are doable by people who are under level 10 that give experience or items that are worthwhile for their level?  Well, due to many characters being secondaries, none.  Why do the goblin bead quest in Kaladim for rusty weapons and some low level armour when you can use a higher level to get 40+ gear for that level 8 dorf?<P>Oh well, I kinda got off on a tangent, but you get the point.  Don't just tune for the 50+ crowd.  Fix the whole damn game...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>great post, but...<P>I think the biggest problem on the oldest servers is item saturation.  You almost feel bad seeing a newbie in bronze, while I can remember the first time I saw someone in broze and thought how uber they were.  If you are saying players have it harder now to level than these uber people did, you are wrong.  The availability of items and info now is amazing, making leveling not even 1/10th as hard as it was when the uberest of the uber were wearing rubicite.  <P>It's a closely related separate problem, that kinda takes the wonder out of things like the first time I made myself a set of patchwork. (god, can't believe it's been almost 2 years)<P>I'll move on from eq not because it isn't a great game, but because I wan't that amazement again.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&lt;&lt;The issue is why should the player who leveled more slowly than the leading edge players face a more difficult Nagafen or Vox, or Hate, or Fear&gt;&gt;<P>This works two ways. Those that level slower also benefit from the economic design that continually brings more and more powerful equipment and skills into the game.<P>I dont like either effect. I dont like Vox getting harder. I also dont think EQs original players should have had warriors wearing bronze armor in the 40s.<P>The economic design and mudflation are only a part of the problem.<P>IMO the even bigger problem was that EQ wasnt beta tested at the higher levels except by many people. When the level limit was raised it also created more problems due to lack of testing.<P>If warriors and rogues had appropriate equipment from the beginning they wouldnt have been complaining so much at the beginning. If warriors and rogues werent continueingly given so much more than everyone else due to those complaints (which were at the time legit) casters would not now feel so limited.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

From there on the mudflation spiral of larger guilds and content designed to challenge larger guilds began.

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;Play well and make friends. When you play well people remember you.  When you make friends people remember you. So when you do both, say with someone in this "tiny" minority you talk about, you will have a chance to join them. Accept the challenge and move on with your character.&lt;&lt;<P>You've missed the point, lord_bhaal.  I have plenty of friends, both within and outside of my guild.  I imagine Bogmog probably does, as well.  If I wanted to, I could probably go on major raids every night of the week.  The fact is, I don't want to.<P>Which brings me to the next point:<P>&gt;&gt;There has to be more content for ONE SOLID GROUP of players. ( 6 man party ) not 40+ people to tackle one mob.&lt;&lt;<P>Exactly, reckless_fist!  Sometimes people just want to hang out with a few friends, whack a few mobs, and RELAX for an evening.  Why do so many of the xp-giving encounters post-50 need to be huge, multi-group, precision onslaughts?<P>I don't have any desire to do large-scale raids 7 nights a week; I have neither the time nor the energy for that.  When I want to take part in an "uber-encounter" now and then, I have enough friends to make it possible for me to do so.  But there's so little for my high-level character to do with a small group of friends that she's pretty much retired now.  I bring her out once in a while for those occasional high-level raids, and I spend most of the rest of my time playing secondaries.<P>Makes me wonder sometimes why I bothered levelling her up so high in the first place.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Precisely EQGirl, there IS a disparity of play, and that is precisely the problem I want to confront.  I don't think EQ is beyond hope, quite to the contrary, it is clearly evident that there is a great game buried here - the problem is that because of the mudflation, that game has become solely available to a small subset of the population.  The rest starve, or scavenge for scraps.  I think I understand what the devs talk about when they get misty, and wax philosophical about the Vision(TM), I just think that because of their misguided focus on challenging that tiny fraction of the player base rather than the average player/group/guild, what is contained in that vision is kept out of reach to all but the few, the very, very few.  I think the developers have to step back, take a deep breath, and look at the game and player base as a whole, by narrowly focusing on a few, they've let things get out of hand, and I'm afraid they don't even realize it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Those zone, however, are in the minority and the rewards are few.  <P>I mean just look at what it takes to get an Epic Weapon for any class.  If your not in an uber-guild good luck getting what you need.  Look at the high-end items as well that 99.9% of the EQ population will never see, but VI places such emphasis on.  <P>VI needs to start tailoring the game toward the majority of people.  Why spend so much time working on a zone like VP, when only 1 in 1000 people will ever go there?

</FONT><HR>*sigh* I read one of the best posts I've read here, scroll down to the bottom, and not a single reply from Verant after 20 hours the post has been up.

</FONT><HR>I also agree.<P>I am not a fan of large raids. It is simply too large a time commitment to devote to a game.<P>I would like to see more average content for the 50+ player, but if there isn't any, I can play my alternates or ultimately, another game.<P>Another poster up there also had a very good point: the game at all levels needs a bit of tuning. However, 50+ is where a character can painfully stagnate. The frustration is compounded by the previous time investment as well.<P>It is a very puzzling situation to say the least.<P>Smif</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>IMHO everquest probably started out wonderfuly. Then like man discovering fire, some player discovered a trade window, and it all went downhill.<P>Any reason at all why if you want something you should`nt have to get it yourself? Why every class specific magic procing item uber or otherwise like in the early levels can`t be lore and no-drop?<P>Trade destroyed economies in eq,uo, probably will the new kids eying up the block too. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053175-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053175-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053175-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053175-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053175-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053175-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053175&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053175&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
