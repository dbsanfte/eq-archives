</FONT><HR>Ok. First off, I am level 27 and never been to PoM. But I like a good riddle.<P>Has anyone thought that everything in the zone has a correlation with everything else? Like everything in the zone is linked somehow for one big riddle? Anyone see in the Ninth Gate movie he had to answer the riddle of the nine gates by decoding 9 pictures? Hmm, I dunno. Say like, every NPC in the zone seems to have a problem. Is there a way to link them together and have an answer for the zone?<P>The 4 halflings surrounding the chest, maybe this sorta reflects the old "Sphinx" riddles, where you are presented a problem or question by the Sphinx (lynx?) and when you get it right you recieve a tresure or permission to pass? It seems you all are putting phrases together from their names, so maybe this is the right track. Perhaps once you figure out the riddle, the chest becomes indifferent and you can talk to it or something. I dont know<P>really i have no idea. if the whole answer to this is just to guess it, its a really bad riddle</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Please forgive the odd order of my responses.<P>1) Talladar, the idea of giving up is interesting.  If Zorben's analysis is correct, then that would actually be the proper thing to do -- it shows greater intelligence than fighting a losing battle.  The conventional way of giving up in a chess match is, if I remember correctly, to say "I concede" and knock over your king.  Or to say "Hey, look at that!" and quickly move one of your opponent's pieces to a less-favorable position.<P>2) Irontaail, although you would have to use shorter phrases, if you're just doing words it would save space on your socials to do "/pause 20,what bread" instead of "what bread" on one line and then "/pause 20" on the next.  Please note that the pause happens after the other command (in this case an implicit /say or whatever your default chat channel is), there is no space after the comma, and /pause is the only command you can "stack" with another in that way.<P>3) This is a question.  You say part of the problem just getting there is dragons that scowl even if you have good CoV faction?  Well...what if you have good Yelinak faction from Skyshrine, which is needed for the class armor quests there?  Considering how few people even get to the ToV to /con stuff, I will not be terribly disappointed if no one knows the answer to this.<P>4) Dorla-Xegony said:<P>"I saw this quote posted on a site:<BR>&gt;&gt;You say, 'white stallion?'<BR>Lithiniath says 'WhY dOeS eVErYonE aSk mE abOuT tHaT crEAturE? ThE oNly sTalLions I hAVe sEeN aRe iN tHe PLaNe oF GrOwTh! SuReLy BrisTleBaNe iS cAUsiNg yOuR eYeS tO deCieVe yOu!! NeXt yOu'rE gOiNg tO tEll Me tHeRe aRe fLyiNG MOnkeYs! ThEre sHaLL bE nO mOre tALk oF nOn eXistaNt cReAturEs."<P>So, "/tell Lithiniath tHeRe aRe fLyiNG MOnkeYs".  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P>Sorry, that's so obvious I'm sure it's already been done and just not mentioned, but I couldn't help myself.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>5) Just as 86 is likely a reference to to "deep-six" a.k.a. sink (a ship) a.k.a throw away or destroy; 22 is likely a reference to catch-22 a.k.a. a lose-lose situation a.k.a. a novel with that title by Kurt Vonnegut, from which the phrase is derived.  Sorry I can't be more specific; I've never actually read it myself.  However, some NPC's will pick things up (as would-be twinkers often discover).  It would not surprise me if the King of Thieves prefers to grab things for himself, rather than having them handed to him.  The catch-22 interpretation is consistent with the room where you walk into a chessgame where your side is already destined to lose, and the fact that it is an entire zone that was clearly designed to be as difficult to figure out as possible.  Oops, just read to where InnoruukSK referenced Catch-22.<P>6) As far as using emotes on NPC's, /ponder is a good one to use with chess.  /laugh is an undocumented animated emote (not mentioned in eqmanual_supplement.doc) -- as a barbarian, I do a long, mocking, thigh-slapping thing that fits with the mischief theme, if I remember correctly.  I only know about it because I keep forgetting (for nine months now) to print out the list of emotes, and sometimes I want to laugh at someone; I tried it and it worked.<P>7) D3FIANT: actually, looking at your sample anagrams for Ferjeneror, I suddenly saw "free Jonerr" which sounds like a pet name.  I hate suggesting this because it is probably a meaningless coincidence, but there is actually a way to free a pet: if I remember correctly, it is to get it charmed by an NPC, kill the NPC, and then memblur it (or something like that).  It will then be a normal non-KOS mob.  Doh, just got to the part where Kalapuikko remarked on that same anagram.<P>8) Irontaail said, "Also interesting note about the 4 moving halflings and the chest out side .. they move at a specific interval ... they all rotate clockwise by 1 spot .. then 45 secs later they do it again .. then 45 secs later then cross over to opposite sides then 90 secs later restart the proccess."  That sounds like a square-dancing maneuver I did just a month or two ago (my elderly-yet-energetic grandmother recently got remarried, and since she is a dancing fiend there was all manner of dancing at her wedding).  Completely irrelevant, just thought I would mention it.<P>I still have to read Part 2 of this thread, but I have finished Part 1 and Part 3 (up to this post of course).  I will see what else I can come up with tomorrow, since right now this is more interesting to me than actually playing the game (can't solo for xp, long corpse runs to anywhere interesting, no invis for getting to groups with open slots in dangerous places...don't even get me started).<P>Tudan &lt;Flux of Chaos&gt;<BR>a_barbarian_warrior35<BR>Torvonnilous</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>King's Court<BR>This game also bills itself as "supercheckers" and that pretty well describes it -- a big board (64 diamonds), a lot of pieces (each player has 24), and a big free-for-all as you go jumping all around (all pieces move like checker kings) over every piece in sight (including your own -- this is good for setting up long multi-stage jumps that leave your opponent plus a dropped jaw and minus a lot of pieces). But surprisingly enough, the object of the game is not to capture all of your opponent's pieces, but rather to make it so your opponent no longer has any pieces in the 16-diamond center court area. Anyway, it's a cool game and a nice variation on checkers.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Iron, you are more of a man than most of us. Everyone is doing a fine job. I have to /frown at FoH for not giving a better hint for you since you are pretty much the PoM personality,. Either way, chess matches are duels, the chess board is PvP. This could be more than just flavor. Have yall tried dueling different classes and races? If white is winning then maybe you need to have a light race beat a dark race. Seems to be ogres and halflings here right? Maybe you need a halfling rogue to beat up on a Ogre whatever. I would try this at least with some of the options. Granted yall dont have much people up there now, but this is the best idea I could think of so far.<P>Another point if the rooms are interconnected wit h quests needing to be solved in each room in specific order then Black and White room has to be it, its the only place you actually get an item. If thats the case then I would attempt something more there. Have no clue what but it seems more logical.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I may be wrong, but I believe the only reason the Black/White room is there, is for the Tunarean Signet Ring... Kill Lilainth(sp), he drops a horn.. <P>The whole point of that is because all unicorns used to be "good", and Bristlebane corrupted some in with the powers of Mischief... The only way to return Lil to a good unicorn is to return his soul to a good "carrier" or whatever... In this case, its the catatonic(sp) white stallion on the other side of the room. Turn the horn into the white stallion, and it BECOMES the good Lil and then despawns after giving you the crest of the unicorn for the Tunarean Signet ring thingy...<P>There could possibly be other quests tied into the same NPCs, but I really dont think so...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Zorbin's analysis of the chess game is excellent. If white was put in check and realized that checkmate was inevitable, it would explain why the players, presumably Bristlebane as black and maybe another deity as white, have left the game board. Perhaps if you figured out who was the white player and told the pieces that that player surrendered or conceded, as in "/say Fizzlethorpe has surrendered".<P>Saw this quote from Absor in another thread, "PoM doesn't really belong on your list", referring to a list of zones (VP, Sleeper's Tomb, and PoM) that a player complained were not practical to obtain access to. I read this as an admission that the "correct" way into PoM has not yet been found.<P>Free Irontaail!<P>--- Geffin Dagrifter<BR>    Wealth Redistribution Engineer<BR>    Level 48, E'ci</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just a quick note here.  I have quite a few feelings about FoH keeping what they have learned to themselves... both pro and con.  I won't get into it here, but open this way because there is a clue in the screenshot.  I hesitate to point it out because undoubtedly how they show off their prizes will change after me saying this.  It would appear they are in the 'Alice in Wonderland' section.  Nowhere else in the zone (that I have discovered) has such large floor tiles, even if someone was shrunk.  I know this because I have stared at 83492346843561283 tiles while making my maps.  On my server the 3 halflings on the tables of the end-room have faction (con apprehensive to a high elf) and are holding bows.<P>Tolven</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

You have to go through a lot of crap just to GET to PoM entrance. Alot of the monsters seem to range from 44-51, according to sites, some players are soloing some spawns. This doesnt seem right.

</FONT><HR>I'm back with more chessboard thoughts.<P>If my analysis is right, white loses, no matter what.  In that vein here are some ideas.<P>First, I had no idea the chessboard was pvp.  (must have missed that in my analysis)  That presents an intersting situation.  My first line of thought would be, find some way to finish the game.  Unfortunately, the next move is whites and he either HAS to move the king (aparently impossible) or he HAS to take the knight (aparently also impossible)  So that sort of goes right out the wiondow.<P>But, there is also the possability of giving cards to gorillas.  I think this has already been tried, but here is what would need to happen (in my opinion).  The big flaw in this is that there are no white cards.  Assuming there were, then they would corruspond to...<P>Bishop Thingy gets - White Knight<BR>I Like This One gets - Black Crown  (More on why this is in a moment)<BR>Another Piece gets - White Crown<BR>Some Other Pice - Black Squire<BR>Random Piece - Jester<P>I Like This One could also be a rook.  From the cards perspective, it makes sense, since we are limited in choices.  It also makes sensse from a playable point of view.  It certainly changes the game though.  In fact, if it's a rook, the game is not an inevitable checkmate.  (although white is in serious trouble)  Also, is the kniight a real knight, or does it just sort of look like one?  (Can someone post a screenshot of the cards please!!!)  If it just looks like some guy in armour, it could be the bishop.  Remeber, on a chessboard the bishop is mostly a tall piece topped with a helm.<P>Anyway, maybe if you give each gorilla his correct card they all do something, maybe even run around and finish the game.<P>Since there are no white cards, maybe red or blue ones can substitiute.  (maybe different ones produce different results as well)<P>Again, I'm just throwing stuff around.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

It won't chase you when agro.  The only way I found of moving it was to charm it.  It will run anywhere you want it to charmed.  Note here.  The halflings stop their dance routine when the chest leaves the glade they are in... and restart when I bring the chest back.  Halfings' names are Mnyup, Xnyl, Pela, Klia.

</FONT><HR>Another Analysis on the Triton board Im coping here by Celandro ...<P>***********<P>Celandro<BR>Pleb   posted March 09, 2001 07:13 PM              <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Looking a bit closer at the second screenshot, the gorillas are facing either white or black directions leading me to believe that the following is true:<BR>Black pieces:<BR>Some Other Piece<BR>I Like This One<P>White pieces:<BR>Bishop Thingy - White Bishop<BR>Another Piece<BR>Random Piece<P><BR>IP: Logged<BR> <BR>Celandro<BR>Pleb   posted March 09, 2001 07:58 PM              <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>note: top left corner is A1, letters go down A-H numbers go left 1-8<BR>working backwards, the last 2 moves were:<BR>WP D5-D6 - (checking IL)<BR>BK E6-D4 - check<P>Things you can assume are true:<BR>A)Since the Black King did not kill WP, that means that it must be guarded. so AP is White Rook OR White Queen<BR>B)Since the Black King was not in check by AP, AP can not move diagonally. so AP is White Rook OR White Knight<BR>A+B)AP is White Rook<P>C) BT must be White Bishop because White King was not in check and it also makes sense since it was guarding both the pawns before the last move<P>D) SP can not be a Rook or Queen because White King was not in check. so SP is Black Knight, Black Pawn, or Black Bishop<P>E) SP did not kill the pawn so it can not move diagonally backwards or is more important than a pawn and rook. so SP is Black Knight, Black Pawn, Black Rook, Black Queen<P>F) SP did not kill BT (white bishop) so SP is not Black Knight<BR>D + E + F) SP is Black Pawn<P>G) IL did not kill the pawn which means it was more important than a rook and pawn or it can not move diagonally meaning it is either Black Queen, Black Rook, Black Knight<P>H) BP at H4 is only protected if IL is Black Queen! if RP can move diagonally, then IL must be BQ which makes the set up much more interesting<P>Pieces summary:<BR>AP = White Rook<BR>BT = White Bishop<BR>RP = probably meant to be unknown which is why its called random.. board probably does not matter what the piece is.<P>IL = Black Queen! or Black Rook or Black Knight<BR>SP = Black Pawn<P>Black Knight is threatening to kill AP causing a BK for AP and WP trade (black wins) however WP can take IL so its a bit more complicated. <P>What do the traps signify? What do they do? How do you get anything to happen? Did you try telling each of the gorillas what piece they were? I need some more info on this room <P>Cel<P><BR>*********** <P><BR>Does this basically also match our other Chess analysis?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am happy to announce that this bard is now bound in PoM!!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> /cheer /dance.<P>Also... we were able to obtain a jester!  Dropped from My Right Hand.<P>More news with the KOS chest in the courtyard.  I tried charming it and taking it in to talk to another chest, however, while the mushrooms won't agro, the hands on the wall got really pissed as my pet was walking down thier wall.  Rejected that plan for the moment.  Careful positioning of the chest via charm will make it so that just specific halflings move.  I can stack them up in a pile of 3.  Because they move in triangular patters, can't get all 4 in the same place.  I really don't think this is going anywhere tho, since they all converge in their normal pathing.  Got frustrated, killed the chest, and headed off to a guild raid &lt;g&gt;<P>These are some EXCELLENT analysii (sp?) of the chessboard.  Still unsure how we can do anything with them tho.  King needs to move, or the black knight taken.  Those are the only two moves that white can make.  They are fixed structures in the zone.  <P>I tried all of Harry's anograms to no avail.<P>Tolven</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
