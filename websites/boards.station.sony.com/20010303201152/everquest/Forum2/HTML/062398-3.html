</FONT><HR>Eduin, regardless of the quality of the information you put forth, your method of deliverance is aggressive. After the first two blatant FOH attacks, I lost interest in anything you had to say. Why? Not because of how true your argument might be, but because it so disgusted me to read what you'd written. There are blatant attacks and general bad feelings in every post you've made on this thread. Don't come here to attack others.<P>For myself, I agree that the high level game is broken, and have lost a lot of enjoyment in playing my cleric.

</FONT><HR>I think the code for melee taunt is broken. So, there's a lot of agro for the first hit, but after that in the mixup you'll note that whoever is on top over a SHORT PERIOD will win out. Admittedly I don't group much with my melee and I have other's hits off for most of the time, but I am hypothesizing that Verant coded agro to decrease over time (melee agro that is) and that the timespan is a fairly short interval.<P>This would allow melee characters to swap back and forth if they wanted to at will, which would be good. But that also means their totals will remain small and never go very high.<P>In otherwords:<BR>First 10 rounds<BR>Warrior : 2150 agro //with first hit<BR>Monk : 1800 agro //catching up<P>Next 10 rounds<BR>Warrior : 1900 agro // no longer first hit, but taunt button<BR>Monk : 1800 agro //that's what he does per round!<P>Next 10 rounds, warrior stops using taunt<BR>Warrior : 1700 agro // no first hit, lower dmg output<BR>Monk : 1800 agro //steady ...<P>Warrior get's CH'd<BR>Cleric : 6500 agro<BR>Warrior : 1900 agro // taunting like mad<BR>Monk : 1800 agro // did this ever change?<P>Four rounds later:<BR>Cleric : 6000 agro<BR>Warrior : 1900 agro<BR>Monk : 1800 agro<P>Cleric dies next round...<P><BR>That's totally hypothetical, but I think VI coded it that way, and that's a pile of BS... let taunt accumulate or make casters deagro faster...<P>- Gaeb<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hail FoH,<P>I was reading "My experience in temple of veeshan as a lvl 53 cleric" by Bakara-FOH on the EQ Messageboards and also Furors responce to peoples posts there.  I was interested in the tactic of having to have clerics gate to clear aggro.<P>We did the Overking last week for a guild cleric and to prevent aggro on him duging the big fight I began to cast CoH on him as soon as he cast CH on our main tank Adex since there is a 2 sec gap between his spell and mine it worked wonderfuly.  This effectivly kept him unharmed as we needed him alive to loot immediatly after the Overking went down.<P>Would this strategy be at al useful in ToV or other Velious encounters?  I am sure you probably though of this already if your not using it but I was curious as to why it doesnt work for you guys.  Do the MOBs last so long due to outrageous HP that the magician would run OOM to keep CoH the cleric?<P>Thanks,<P>Jaytee Bushwacker &lt;Obsidian Guard&gt;<BR>56.6 Conjurer,<BR>Master S.T.U.J.<BR>PETS!

This guy is a moron, the way he talks of the game I doubt he has been anywhere in Velious where the need to tank extra's because enchanters cant do a thing in Velious but buff.

</FONT><HR>Thank you Hoffwin, for pointing out the MAJOR hole in Eduin's statement.<P>Eduin, do you even PLAY a Cleric?<P>As for the Call of the Hero tactic, here are the problems with that.  1) Recast time, 15 seconds.  A very minor problem, but it's there.  2) Costs a Pearl per casting.  Sure, a Pearl isn't expensive... but the yard trash mobs often don't drop anything to even cover half of that cost.  3) The aggro clearance is not 100% guaranteed.  I believe someone posted that, by experimentation, it was about 75% effective.<P>As for the Mem-blur/Atone tactic.  Even assuming the mobs could be mem-blurred/atoned, the second they have an empty hate-list they regen an insane number of hitpoints per tick.<P><BR>The more I read, the more I think that the problem is NOT the hate-aggro (well, it's a shade high...), but the problem is the ABSOLUTE lack of taunting effectiveness.<P>Have every press of the Taunt button be the equivalent of 1/2 of the Warrior's skill added to the mob's hate-list.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>He is a quote from a Verant patch message:<P>"A team member has asked that we clarify the changes to the way hate is awarded in healing. The important point that may not have been clear below is that there is a cap on the amount of hate that can be awarded for any particular heal spell. For a target below level 51, no heal spell can generate more than 800 hate, regardless of the number of hitpoints healed. For targets level 51 or above, the cap is higher, but does not approach the total hitpoints of a fully buffed warrior. "<P>The last sentence is the kicker.  If Furor did 8,000 damage to the drake, how come the drake attacked the cleric after a heal?  Something here is broken.  Tactics are irrelevant and the game is not working as intended based on the patch message.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Any encounter that requires stuff like that is stupid.  It use to be that you actually needed some skill to manage aggro and time all the healing but now you need cheesy tactics.

</FONT><HR>Has anyone considered why the mobs are so tough?<P>Pre-patch (when the aggro for heals was less) tanks could be healed with relative impunity - old news.  Verant made the mobs tougher to compensate for the toughness of the tanks - if a tank can be healed for a bar of clerics mana, the tank has effectively 100K HP (give or take) so the mobs were made tougher to compensate.  This was 'balanced' (dirty word!) because the mobs were taking and giving out as much damage as the group of tanks were.<P>Post patch, the equation is changed - because as soon as the cleric dies (nearly instantaneous) the tanks no longer have the same HP pool as the mobs, and are thus quickly reduced to confetti.<P>This is my reason behind wanting the cleric aggro reduced to the old levels.  Not because it wasn't broken - it WAS broken - but because the game was previously set up to work with it, and now with the change the game is unbalanced toward the mobs.  It would be much simpler to put cleric aggro back where it was than to reduce the HP of the mobs, then reduce the damage of the weapons that tanks have to match, then reduce the AC of the mobs so the tanks could hit it, then reduce the AC of the tanks so the mobs could hit them, then.....  NOBODY, least of all I, would want this.<P>Please, folks.

</FONT><HR>Oh God...<P>Troll Eduin just joing this discussion, I got disgusted in the first page.<P>He hates Necros and Clerics.  Why ?  He playes a lvl 60 Shaman.  He feels that Necro are too powerfull (Envy) and that Clerics were too good at healing (Envy)...<P>He's as happy as a pig in **** with these changes, he probably got a permanent smile on his face too...<P>Oh well, I guess we need trolls in this world.  But hey... at least He's making a name for himself, and people just take him THAT seriously....
