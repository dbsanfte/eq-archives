</FONT><HR>I think a big problem with EQ down time is that the risk vs. reward isn't balanced due to the following factor:<P>Risk is constant.<P>Reward is random.<P>If I go on a Planar Raid, I am not going for experience. Raids are a bad source of experience, and a good source of loot. In fact, going to the planes almost means CERTAIN death, but there's a small chance of getting any of the nice equipment that drops in that plane, and less chance of getting a decent amount of exp.<P>Look around the game and you'll find that there are often many more risks than rewards, and the penalty of a risk (amount of Exp lost for dying) is generally greater, and more constant, than the rewards (amount of exp for killing something, phat lewt dropping off a mob)<P>The problem that people complain about isn't that there is downtime, I believe. It's the fact that that down time is constant and you know it will happen, and it's the same every time. But you can go out and seek a reward, spend several hours pursuing it, have all the requisite components of a group on hand, be able to gain the reward in every facet except for random chance, and that random chance is what keeps you from getting a reward.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I apologize if this idea has already been posted, I haven't had time to read through all 10 pages of both thread lines.<P>Brad, in response to your question about traveling time .. I completely agree that the first time travelling to a new place is great, even with the boats.  After that though .. been almost two years of going across Antonica now and I can tell you what a thrill it is these days :P<P>The dragon teeth were a step in the right direction.  However, they still require the use of a druid/wizard to get you there.  Frankly, there isn't always one of those classes around and willing to teleport, and if they are, sometimes they charge amazingly high fees.  I've seen druids charge as much as 500-600p to take people to Velious.  A lot of times, hoofing it is better than standing around for an hour auctioning with no luck or paying your last two dungeon run's worth of loot to get there.<P>I really think the only way you are going to cut down on the travel times is to either make it so that items like the dragon tooth cast a gate spell, or there are more "teleporters" like what you find within Erudin or to some of the planes, but allowing travel between cities or such.  I think the tooth idea is preferable because it means you have to actually walk somewhere first.<P>Obviously, if you had an item cast a gate, you would want to make it so that the location it would teleport you to was more "out of the way" than a druid/wizard teleport location, took far more time to cast (like a minute) and was easily interrupted if you move or are attacked (to prevent it being used for an evac) - or even make it castable only in cities, the way Kunark evacs can only be cast in Kunark dungeons.  This could cut down on travel time without cutting into the very useful spells that druids and wizards can cast.<P>Just a thought  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Brad, I hope you're still reading down this far  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">. You said once you used to play on SojournMUD or Duris. I'm part of the small minority that actually knows what that means. I've never played either myself, but I play and create zones for ArcticMUD, where several Sojourn players have migrated to (fairly popular too with 1200+ players *toot* *toot*). I mention this because the idea that I want to bring up is probably something you as a text-MUD player have experienced. Bear with me, I'll get to the actual proposition in a couple of paragraphs  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>First off, I have to say I always enjoy your discussions and remember when you used to have more time to post on these boards. Things carry much more weight with the players when it is you discussing design problems and issues (might have something to do with you being the producer...). Also, you have a very straightforward and contemplative approach in your discussions.<P>I've enjoyed this game immensely since Phase4 Beta, through all the positive and negative changes, so as you can see I've been here a while. I've gotten several post 50 characters across 3 servers that cover a  third of the classes in the game, meet many friends, and still wonder at the "architecture" of the wood chain bridge in the Karanas. But unfortunately I haven't even logged on in the past 4 months, due to various reasons such as it being my last few semesters in college (finally!) and some very good friends leaving. What is "strange" is that I finally went back to playing that text-mud I mentioned, as opposed to just creating zones for it. Some, ok, ALOT of people would find it wierd to "backstep" from a beautifuly realised graphical game to a pure text game. Maybe you might understand. The best analogy I can think of is comparing the two to books and movies. Both forms essentially tell stories which will hopefuly engage a person. However books, despite language and some stylistic changes, haven't changed *that* much over the centuries. A person can pick up a book written decades ago -- the works of Shakespeare, Moby Dick, Treasure Island, The Time Machine, Oliver Twist, Catcher in the Rye, etc -- and still enjoy it. Movies on the other hand, have to constantly evolve technically to draw more audiences. That is why graphical muds seem to have a shorter lifespan as compared to text-muds: 2 years for EQ as opposed to now going 7 years for the one I work/play on.<P>Well I thought this "nostalgia" was only something I was experiencing. However, I've now seen alot of old players who left the mud to play EverQuest now returning. Again, this isn't a knock against EverQuest. As I said, I've had an immeasurable amount of fun during my stay here. I started to wonder why exactly is this. What is it about the game that is drawing people back. Once again, it came back to downtime. Now I don't mean downtime in terms of the death penalty etc. Experience/item loss is cake here compared to other games. There are several issues that are causing this this return however: camping/inability to "do" dungeons, appearance that few stats matter much, etc. But this thread isn't for that so I will (finally) mention one aspect of the downtime/time investment problem I see.<P>I noticed alot of players mention that they find it hard to travel from zone to zone looking for pickup groups. They end up wasting time inside and outside the dungeons looking for a party to adventure with. While of course this is partly avoided by forming a group/guild of friends to adventure with, the idea of going to a dungeon/area alone to look for a group is very counter to the philosophy in D&D and the muds I've played over the years. In those settings this grouping and preparation was done in the cities, towns, and villages where people met, recouped from adventuring, and set up for more adventuring. The towns/cities in EverQuest have little importance except as a place to buy 200 iron ration and 200 bottles of water then leave, or wait for a ship, or work on the odd tradeskill. Most of the towns are underused and lie empty except for  maybe 10 people 95% of the time.<P>Now how does this relate to downtime? Since the towns are underused, give the player/group a beneficial reason to return there more often. Give the players a way to reduce this downtime if they choose to go back to the cities. Maybe better mana/hp regeneration for each class in their respect guilds. Wouldn't you be more at ease and your magics flow better when at the centers of your type of magic/discipline. Maybe let the priest classes heal/buff/ressurrect more efficiently when in their own temples. Possibly allow wizards the ability to travel more efficiently back to their respective guilds once attaining a certain level above 50. <P>A side effect of making the town more important is now the classes that have a much harder time getting from place to place (everyone except wizards, druids, bards, and to a degree shamans) will have some assurance that if they just go to these closer and easier to access towns there is a good chance they might find a group. There are of course balance/abuse issues with these ideas and the fact whether this would help at all considering the "camp" mentality of most players. Would anyone want to leave a good "camp" and go back to the towns? Would people just overcrowd the towns to get these small benefits? As I said, since you used to play a mud Brad, I'm sure you were aware of all of these conventions when designing EQ1, and maybe you considered them but realised they weren't feasable at the time. But if not for EQ1, I would hope that these could be re-examined in later sequels to EverQuest.<P>I still lurk around these boards and check out all the sites for ongoing news about EverQuest. Even though I feel I'm through for now, I can still see why people still enjoy this game and remember my time here fondly. EverQuest still has great potential and hopefuly one of these days my situation will let me come back  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>Thank you for your time.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I had wished to contribute to this post briefly.  As a long time player and DM of pen and paper RPG's the one thing I have learned is that you never ever take away things that people have worked hard to achieve.  This includes levels and important quest items.  I feel that corpse retrieval is completely resonable, and even that the experience loss is justified to a point.  But, to take away a level from someone, who has fought hard and long to get to that level, is, in my opinion, unfair.  Perhaps having a zero marker for the level, and not losing more XP than that would be an appropriate alternative.<P>That's just my two copper.<BR>Veldrin Darkfyre<BR>Tarew Marr<BR>Officer, Flame of the Phoenix</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Downtime as a penalty is part of the primary design of the game, but what often gets missed is that this means we get 'penalized' whenever we decide to do something other than pound on monsters.<P>The only rewards in the game are experience and loot.. if you are not actively pursuing these, then you are getting the same penalty as if you had made a play mistake!<P>If you want to encourage a certain behavior, then you MUST reward that behavior with experience or loot. Think exploring is important? Create a small experience reward for the first time you set foot on a new bit of map. Think roleplaying is important? Create a database where people can give feedback on how well they feel each person is roleplaying, and give experience bonuses for people you can consistantly get high roleplaying marks from their peers.<P>Time as a penalty has some serious game design drawbacks. Create new rewards, or create a new penalty.<P>-Zaphod<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>About the risk vs reward thing.<P>One of the biggest problems is that Verant seems to assume reward means 'loot' and penalty means 'time'. <P>The higher level you get, the easier it becomes to gain the same piece of 'loot'. Gaining higher levels is the result of 'time'. <P><BR>Therefore until you are close to maximum level taking 'risks' in EQ is discouraged. Why spend time aquiring something that can be gained much faster with a lower risk later on. If you go back and get your loot later you end up aquiring a greater overall reward of both loot and experience in a shorter overall period of time.<P>That is why you dont see many mid level players in mid level dungeons. Instead you see more high level players in them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I see no problem with a bind afinity potion.  Especially if you were the one that went out to quest for the items and then had a Shaman friend make the potions for you.  Yes there is some downtime cause you are having to quest for the items, but the reward is a bind afinity potion, which I would glady spend the time trying to get.<P>Now the NPC Idea is good too.

</FONT><HR>I can see that one of the major problems in the 'risk vs reward' goal as it relates to fighting mobs is character balance.<P>The mob has to give the least possible reward that is reasonable for the class or group that has the easiest time killing it.  If it gave a reward greater than that, then suddenly there would be class imbalance.<P>So most of the time, the reward isn't worth the risk.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Downtime wouldn't be an issue if everyone was having fun. Downtime, a byproduct of uptime, is the time players are bored, discontent, or ornary after completing some part of uptime that was found mildly amusing. Since, post 50 gamers have to muster a dark age army( this is no small task; and why wasn't this requirement on the box?),  for any epic event, the time averages out to lots of downtime which is stressful to the hellbent, X generation, I want things now especially fun on my leisure time dimmit.<P>EQ needs a "creatively" revamped "more dynamic" battle event and magic system from which everyone would benefit.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>RE: Experience penalty at Hell +1!<P>You should not lose a greater portion of experience if you just went through a hell level (i.e. 30, 35, 40, 45).  Most people are aware of the extra work to break through these levels, what some fail to realize, is that when you die at 31, 36, 41 .... you lose a full bubble of experience rather than the usual 1/2 a bubble on previous levels.  I know this is because of how the experience penalty is calculated using the experience for a current level -1 warrior.  Please, either spread the experience equally over the 5 levels or adjust for deaths at these levels.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Personally what has always bothered me is that i have the same ratio of deaths per level no mater what that level was. Why is it justified that I pay more for death as I get higher in level? To me this is just a way to keep me at the lower levels. I don't seem to get anything out of it. I also agree on the fact that binding is a really bad issue for melee types. Lots of times no mater what you offer to pay to get a bind you can't get one for sometimes upto a few hours. there should be a npc that can bind at least that is more expensive then the going rate and most of all shouldn't have the ablity to have bad faction with such as the Priest of discord. My final imput has to be that when I first found out that I couldn't zone into a ocean zone with out a boat was one of the most frustrating experiences in the game. The reason behind this is wrong peroid.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, this could get a little long, but hopefully you will bear with me  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I have many things to say about downtime, but first and foremost I'll talk about death.  The amount of 'lost time' that occurs with death is always great, and is, in the opinion of many players, including myself, greater than it needs to be.  I find that when I die with a melee class, I usually spend from 10 to 45 minutes on corpse retrieval.  However, depending on the place you died, and various other factors, it can take well over an hour.  Casters can get corpses back a bit easier, but deep in a dungeon, the recovery can still take quite a while.  Corpse recovery is just the tip of the iceberg above lvl 20, where you will be spending a good deal of time trying to make up for lost exp.  With a great group, in a great spot, you can't make up for the average death within a half an hour, and most likely not within an hour.  Now, at mid-high levels, you can be ressurected, but this has its downfalls as well.  Yes, you get some xp back, and yes, you don't have to spend time recovering your corpse, but only if an experienced cleric is about, and unfortunately clerics are getting more rare by the day.  As for the lower to mid levels, there is no reprieve for the lost time caused by death.  After considering that most player deaths are either caused by lag, other player's mistakes, or pure bad luck (a never before seen red spawn pops up in an area you travel often), the lost time seems even more out of place.  I feel the penalty for dying should be altered.  A good penalty not yet implemented could be loss of money.  For example, if your character has X pp on him, or in the bank, you lose the pp instead of some of the xp.  The amount of pp would of course go up with level, I believe that the xp loss should be reduced to something near half.<P>I will post again with more ideas later.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I dont know about how it happens for your gaming experiance but downtime is the sole reason why many of us are accused of "taking the path of least resistance".<P>Sitting on your butt staring at that book, is no fun at all.<P>Sitting on your butt waiting for 4 hps a tick is not fun at all.<P>Or staring at that blue bar.<P>So Ppl say to me, got get a cleric/enchanter/bard etc. And i go " so you can push the medding / regen bit onto someone else?" ( i am a warrior/sk btw ). Listen we all are in the game for fun. The various time sinks you have put in the the form of medding,travel and binding are all part of the packet which supposedly encourages grouping,efficiency and player interaction. Now naturally face with this the players do things like PL using twinks , farming and various other ways of reducing the timesinks. I mean you cannot blame us for trying to maximise our efficiency and time used if you planned your downtime in such a manner.<P>It all comes to the samething at the psot 50 levels. Something the hybrids are well aware of.<BR>Any big raid is often dominated with the most efficient classes available. Partly it is because some classes do not work well or function as efficiently in such a setting. Thus more downtime or even failure ie hybrids cannot tank the uber bosses without Defensive discipline and thus die, more downtime.. Sure most encounters can be done by a generous spread of players types and classes. But that doesnt happen in practice. That is why the big 3 classes warrior, clerc and enchanter as well as wizzie,rogues and monks are coonsidered necessary for such endeavours and everyone else is "flavor". Its not surprising to realise that these classes are the least affected by the various downtime compared to a hybrid . Again while some might say learn to play your class, tis the same thing with downtime. Players will find the best way to serve their time especially in the face of the timesinks.<P>Oh btw Aradune, your eq questing often invloves ALOT OF PURE LUCK as a method of reward. An example just about any mid 30 armor class quest, or any 24 hour once per real day random rare spawn like Bilge or Stormfeather or whatever. That is a method of rewarding players by pure luck rather than a quest. I think King Arthur would have gone nutso on Merlain if Merlain told him to camp the Sword-in-the-Stone which spawns once every week give or take 24 hours..<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well , as a huge Ultima Online fan i think this game had alot that EQ should've taken in it (PVP *NOT* INCLUDED). First of all UO was an overall enjoying experience stress was to a minimum and you could enjoy your time and feel good doing it. Game was challenging (Dungeons were hard even with good skill) and soloing didn't really lead to overcrowding. The point is if you died you lost all your stuff which was easier to attain but it was enjoyable and you really didn't feel PUSHED to do anything.<P>Here is what is wrong with EQ. It is time consuming and stressful. One might thing stress is important to game play but a game is not there to simulate life it's so we can enjoy our time. If i feel like taking a 10 minute break i want to be able to take a 10 minute break without having my whole group waiting for me too. I know game is group oriented that is fine. But big organised raid of over 30 person is not "fun" or "challenging" or even slightly "interesting". <P>Here is my explanation for this : A typical plane raid consist of more downtime/talking then actualy killing which is boring. We sit there for hours because of res. and other misc organising. And even chat room and all these things that make it overall long and boring. Ok now we need "Ph4t l3wt" and i know not everyone should have this. That is fine create rarity or having stuff that is "hard" to get is always nice. But now it's become almost a necessity and i would really like to be able to play a very successful char to 60 without having to hit any planes because i really don't enjoy spending an entire day doing a raid that isn't even fun for me. <P>Now to my point about UO. It would be very interesting if EQ took that line of "Very small downtime , Very small reward" type of thing UO had. You know in UO a Vicking sword of vanquishing(about best weapon in game) was very rare in itself but not nearly as rare as some EQ items. But in UO you could have 4 of these items in bank but actualy FIGHTING with them was an exploit to be proud of because you would risk to loose it at any time and you would ACTUALY loose it one day or another and that made the thing even more rare. EQ seems to have put downtime just for that , to prevent item from overcrowding servers , but if you make items alot more common but add to this the ability to loose them ? Would that be a good solution ?<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>reward is not always loot. <P>reward can be many things. xp, tactical learning, the thrill of the game, etc. <P>the real reward is "progress". <P>its now a matter of how to define 'progress'.<P>this is very different based on how you play, and who you play.<P>i came back to the game after a 7 month break. i returned with many of my old friends who had played into their 50s and quit. we all started over with different classes to gain a different perspective, and add new life into the game.<P>one of these friends is now lvl 38. He is a gnome warrior. Very well equipped, and a very talented player. Now, he admits that he is once again thinking of quitting. Why, I ask? <P>Lack of progress links. Unlike most other classes, a warrior at that lvl has already gained all it is that he has to gain as far as skills, and all he has to look forward to in charachter development is "Phatter Lewtz", at least till he gets to EQ2, which is the 51-60 game. <P>When i played my purple cleric for months at lvl 50, I had achieved pretty much all the items that I wanted or needed in the game at the time. My definition of "progress" was not xp, as for a long time i was maxed. It was not spells, as I had all my spells. It was not "phatter lewtz" as I had all I really wanted at the time. It was mainly in watching my guildies and my friends attain their spoils. Be those material spoils such as Lewtz, or mental spoils such as their first Dragon or Plane raid. <P>My point is, there must be a better balance in the classes and the game in general, where progress is more measurable, in more ways than it currently exists. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I mostly agree with Zaphod-AVA:<P>"The only rewards in the game are experience and loot.. if you are not actively pursuing these, then you are getting the same penalty as if you had made a play mistake!"<P>There are a few other rewards besides xp and loot. 1) PvP.  Being an avid Unreal Tourney, Quake 3, HalfLife (and CounterStrike) fan, PvP has been extremely enjoyable and rewarding.  Even without xp and loot.<BR>2) Questing.  It is often quite enjoyable, granted without an end reward people probably wouldn't bother.<P>I had quit EQ once as well,  for many of the reasons posted against downtime on this thread.  I had played for well over a year, since beta 4.  Now I'm back, playin' on PvP and having lots of fun, plus lots of the same kind of non-fun that I've had in the past.  ;(<P>Non-fun (N-aw-n F-uhn):  Exercising opportunities that exist for gain of pleasure and excitement, only to caught blind-sided by factors out of your control.<P>I'd call myself a semi-casual gamer.  I play hours on end some days, none on others.  The bane of my experience with EQ the second time around (as well as the first) has been:  The realization that I often spend these hours with the best of skill and intent, with nothing to show for it.  No xp, no loot, no new content, no fun.<P>I'm going to try to explain this with one example in point.  Last time I played, I had a paw of Opolla.  Nice item.  I want one,  I can't explain *exactly* why I want one, I just do.  I have spent countless hours now in Befallen to facilitate getting one.  No luck.  Key word here, luck.  Sure, some players may have the time to sit at their computer for 8 hours, possible a few days of 8 hours.  Not me.  Next will be the mushroom thingy in Guk; and from what I've heard, probably the same story.<P>The solution to this problem was once implemented in the game, and some of you may remember.  The Box of Abu-Kar!!  You didn't hunt a specific mob down for one, all of a sudden I just had one!  Very nice!  No camping for hours, no heavy competition for it.  Very kewl!  Random loot off of certain levels of mobs.<P>Something I think would make many gamers happier is more of a random and incremental reward system.  The Paw quest for example, instead of having to camp for hours (remember the no fun... yada yada...), how about being able to gather many items in many parts of the quest?  As it is now, I've spent hours and hours on exactly this type of problem.  Please let me attain a small incremental portion of it for my time!!!  Please!  Let's not kid ourselves here, this is a *waste* of time, real life time.  And I'm not just talking about the paw, I'm talking about what equates to an average of time spent in this way.  I feel sorry for those that want a Glowing Black Stone;  they probably feel the same way I do, only moreso.<P>/auction AK47,  2h blunt, 1000 dmg, .05 dly, rng 500;  take  down any level 35 or below in one shot!<P>... just had to put that in there.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OMG... obviously I was mistaken in thinking that these threads would serve some purpose that might benefit gameplay in EQ.  It appears the only point is for you to continue to pound the beleif into us that the state of downtime is good and necessary the way it is.<P>I'll paste a couple things I got from the Casters Realm here that caught my eye:<P>"Death of a tank could also = death for the entire group as well. Multiple penalties for all in the group. Death = a long wait for the guy to get back. <P>That's an excellent point, and why we feel the melee binding issue is a balance issue for all classes, and that were it changed the entire pace of the game would change also. In other words, the fact that melee classes cannot self-bind and must bind in city zones is part of the death penalty for both melee classes AND non-melee classes."<P>You're trying to tell us this is a good thing?  Why in the world would you actively seek to punish both melee and caster classes for a melee class dying?  This is just mind boggling...<P><BR>"I understand totally. But why does time lost (due to one death) cost a heck of a lot more than [the experience gained] winning that particular fight. I understand there has to be a penalty, but your system really seems to be designed to hold the player back. <P>Because we expect the majority of time the ratio of NPCs killed to you dying to an NPC to be significantly in your favor. In other words, many more NPCs die than players in most adventures, and so a single death needs to cost the experience gained by killing many NPCs."<P>All I can say is... why?  Why does a single death -need- to cost the experience gained by killing many NPCs?  Where does this concept come from?  What drives this need to program such a penalty into the game?  And how could it -not- be attributed to what the gentleman said?<P>And actually I'll just stop there cause my head really hurts from reading this and this statement pretty much tells me that not a damn thing is going to be improved upon as far as downtime goes in this EQ:<P>"...I created this thread (to get feedback and hopefully new ideas for the future)"<P>Absolutely freakin amazing...<P>Morgian<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

However, all character skills that have increased beyond the max for that old level are set to the max for that level.<P>e.g. At L38 I can have Piercing to 195, I level to 39 and increase it to 200, then i die and loose a level, it goes ack to 195.<P>This would fix 2 probems, Firstly the level loss due to death would be a little more tollerable, and the PvP situation's regarding Deleveling would be impossible as skills would be reduced.<P>Airtreader said: 13.

Still does not relate to downtime. <P>First i have to make a little assumption, and that is you have managed to get your group back in one zone, Assuming this (and i know it happens rarely) rangers and druids can "track" to the lost player and bring them back to the group safely with camo and SOW out doors, then be followed back to the party. ok, so this doesent apply indoors, untill the ranger/druid gets superiour cammo, It also allows the ranger or druid that died to track to the group.<P>Granted this is usually not neccisary if the group has a cleric that can res, and it's only a short part of the downtime, but it helps.<P>My "request" here would be to allow rangers to track a corpse, whialst it is true that they can if the player doesent zone in to any zone now, it would be a usefull addition to the ranger tracking ability, and it would make them a little more desireable in a group. :o)<P>Dargathi Kithkanan<BR>Ranger of the 39'th Undonged dinging.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Like zome here say, Sorry if this has been mentioned before but here is my bit on the current travel downtime.<P>I have a druid, I created for the sole reason she can get places quicker, and others if need be. Now yes I think the teeth was a brilliant idea. I did feel excited walking through strange lands that I otherwise would have just skipped over.  The only problem about it is, once you have these teleports and the teeth, no-one wants to use them. It is not clever to give us the ability to teleport somewhere and then make it so risky that many will walk rather than port, do you call this cutting out downtime. Not only did it increase downtime but it also did it for druids too (not sure about wizards), you trying to put druids and wizards on an even foot with everyone else.<P>Who was the brainiac who thought it would be fun to put a dragon right on top of or near the druid ring in Wakening Lands. I have fell victim to this dragon twice, once through teleport other through trying to get my corpse back.  Not only the Iceclad Ocean has mobs who walk right through the middle of the circle, many times I have been hit before I have even appeared in zone.  I bet I couldn't even pay someone enough to teleport with me to Wakening Lands. While I'm on the dragon, I have my clipping plane set to max and yet the dragon aggros on me before it even comes into my field of view. I don't belong to a guild and I have a very few select friends, how are players supposed to get from one side of the zone to the  other without gathering up 30-40 people to travel with them. <BR>I have stepped out of the giant city on several occasions into Wakening Lands and there has only ever been myself and one other person maximum in zone and I wonder why.<P>Sorry a wandered off a bit there and maybe didn't make my point clear. So to sum up, you say you got closer to the perfect porting with Velious, which I must say the teeth are a cool idea, but the volatile nature of the ports makes them practically useless and very risky (with no reward  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">) so you might as well take the teeth away, cause I wont be using anything but Iceclad and my bind point in Thurgadin.  And several other ports also feel the same way.<P>Good increase in the downtime with Velious, Verant. Longing loading of zones, bigger zones to walk across, very limited porting ability (just as that in Kunark), more camping for spells, quests etc. So you think by opening this discussion you can appease all those that spend ages doing nothing in game, yet your whole new expansion screams nothing but downtime.<P>Oh and on the death thing, corpse retrieval and experience loss, pick one, both is just too hefty a penalty. If time is the penalty your doubling it by doing both. There is both time involved in corpse recovery and regaining XP. I have had corpse recoveries that have taken more than 2 hours to get, sometimes involving more deaths. And everyone know how slow the XP advancment is in EQ. It is deffinitely too late to change this I guess because of all the abilities and extras laid into certain classes but I can say now, I don't think players will stand for penalties like this in future games not with all the other options to them on the "Horizon"   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>I think this discussion could have been better dated for shortly after Kunark so the ideas could be put into Velious. Little too late to talk about it now don't you think. As for other games of the future, can't wait for them to turn up.<P>Geddine<BR>51st Druid<BR>Morrel Thule<P>P.S. If you couldn't tell I've just spent the last 5 hours dying 4 times with my secondary each time running 4 zones back to my corpse only to die a short while later. All because of other peoples trains, bad pathing, bad decisions and maybe some bad luck too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>=======================<BR>"Death of a tank could also = death for the entire group as well. Multiple penalties for all in the group. Death = a long wait for the guy to get back. <P>That's an excellent point, and why we feel the melee binding issue is a balance issue for all classes, and that were it changed the entire pace of the game would change also. In other words, the fact that melee classes cannot self-bind and must bind in city zones is part of the death penalty for both melee classes AND non-melee classes."<P>You're trying to tell us this is a good thing? Why in the world would you actively seek to punish both melee and caster classes for a melee class dying? This is just mind boggling...<BR>=======================<P>Well I can understand the need to 'punish' the group for failure, that isn't the problem. The problem is that when this often happens the groups generally disband, especially pickup groups or in places where you have to wait a long time for the melee's to return.<P>Binding is screwed pure and simple, but I feel that Brad has the current concept hardwired into his brain and simply cannot understand any alternative implementations  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It's nice to see "the man" take time to answer some questions once in a while.<P>This post is about indirect downtime - downtime caused by inefficiency or lowering of abilities.<P>You said something like you dont design EQ to make a huge profit you try to design a great game. Hmmm...ok...if you say so. But then you go and finish off you last post with this:<P>"Recently, as we've focused quite a bit on higher levels and very difficult challenges, we've also added a lot of multiple group content. And while this in and of itself is definitely not a bad thing, in the future we'll make sure more single group challenges are added, as well as content for all level ranges, more playing styles, etc."<P>This looks extremely much like something meant to keep us playing until the next expansion and then buy it because everything will be MUCH better. You have done this many times before and actually it is getting a bit annoying. I play a shaman and therefor know most about what has happend to that particular class and you have made promises that were never kept. For instance one of our very few ways of doing damage - disease spells - were nerfed a long time ago but we were promised that if only we would wait a little we would get something interesting added to the disease spells. A year later absolutely nothing has changed. With Velious we were also promised to just wait a little and many exciting things would be added. Well, duh, we get a few new spells that are of marginal use at best but we also get severely nerfed because mobs on Velious has insane resist-rates.<P>Every time one of your numerous errors causes less downtime (better than expected rewards) it gets fixed instantly. But when an error causes more downtime (bad pathing, mobs teleporting all over the place, SPELLS NOT DROPPING, too many to list them all) it takes forever to get fixed. Why is that? It certainly doesnt seem fair to me.<P>And the comment about making more money from casual players was not that funny. EQ is already extremly much oriented towards non-casual playing and being in uber-guilds so its rather inappropriate to tell casual players that they are actually paying for the continued development of EQ in exactly that direction.<P>Oh, and if you dont know what to ask your customers in the poll you talked about here are a couple of questions for free:<P>Are you satisfied with EQ as it is now?<P>Have you ever been promised anything that hasnt come through?<P>Would you leave EQ tomorrow if another similar but apparently better designed game came out tomorrow?<P>Would you try to persuade all your guildmembers to follow you to the new game?<P>Thank you for your time,<BR>Bumadan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I apologize if I repeat what others have said. I just now walked in from work and sat down and started reading what EQCasters reposted from this thread.<P>First, kudos to Aradune for taking an active interest in attempting to alleviate one of the most frustrating aspects of this game. It is heartening to see such proactivity, especially after such a long communicative hiatus.<P>The death penalty is fine IMHO. I think that VI has put in place a way to defray the time lost due to death, so that it only affects the characters when they do not have access to res spells. Access = making friends/joining a guild/forming a solid group, and this lends itself to the "social" game that EQ strives to be.<P>Travel. Travel by boat is worse than death by Bongo. It is utterly boring, often buggy, and only cool halfway through your first trip. As PC's progress in levels, there ought to be city to city portals, or city to desolate location (one way travel) that can only be accessed by higher level characters and "cost" something (high end gem, X hundred pp, etc). The high cost and level limits would ensure that they wouldnt be abused, and a PC port would always be more attractive. This would help stop some of the travel time as its likely the higher level characters would have the financial resources to burn to use these portals. <P>Access to dungeons -  ESPECIALLY KUNARK. Ye gods, you really messed up that continent in dungeon and port placement/function. Two potentially nice dungeons Droga/Nurga are tantamount to useless due to their level/placement. I cant imagine why any characters of appropriate levels would travel such perilously large zones to fight in such out of the way dungeons for less than exciting loot. It just doesnt follow. We understand that you will NOT allow melee binding. Since you wont, you almost ensure that dungeons like those in Kunark will be unused. Melee deaths will take a VERY long time to recover from. A VERY long time. As they travel back from Fironia Vie/Overthere they are in  grave danger of dying again from the eager denizens of each zone that they must travail. This was just bad structuring/port/zone placement. You really CAN fix this you know... Magic can fix or do anything. How about something along the lines of port pc to his corpse spell; outdoors the Druid gets it, indoors the Wizard gets it. This is a rough idea tossed off the top of my head, but there really needs to be a way to get people to their corpses faster if they die in an out of the way place i.e. anywhere (almost) in Kunark. <P>Risk v Reward. Gotta have risk. The risk of death and corpse recovery downtime (as well as not wanting to look like a complete newbie)is enough for me to want to do my damndest to not die. For the record: We the players of Everquest do our mostest NOT to die. We dislike the xp loss, the corpse recovery and the time required to get said xp back. So we plan for such happenings and act accordingly. The problem is that the way certain places are set up is flawed. The risk of death, heck not only the risk but the inevitability of death in certain areas far outraces the potential rewards: certain Kunark dungeons illustrate this easily. By rewards I am not even specifically talking about loot. Experience as well as loot can be the driving force behind group makeup, and there are certain places that it just doesnt behoove a group to go, as there are more readily available places to get near as good if not better xp/loot as other more remote locations. Plus, WHEN things go wrong in these more readily available places, the downtime is reduced due simply to placement of ports, cities and/or bindable locations. If I am going to venture to an out of the way place and risk downtime of the running tanks, there had better be some REASON for me (and others in my group) to go to those more remote locations. <P>I honestly believe that the xp loss and the time required to get xp back is not NEAR as brutal as the extended wait to get back into action once an outing goes poorly. Truly there is nothing worse than twiddling with full mana, awaiting some poor warrior who pooched the screwed as he runs his sowless arse back to the dungeon. If you could allow us to get back into action faster, all of the other downtime,(note that... ALL OF THE OTHER DOWNTIME) IMHO would be ok. This of course hearkens to Melee binding again, and I know that its a closed subject. A soulbound key to a portal that ports to certain areas in Kunark (from a city) or some other remote locations on any continent (strategically picked) would help a TON. Level limits on such portals would lend itself directly to the issues of "been there done that" boredom of travelling. <P>There are quite a few ways you could allow characters to get from point a to point b faster and thats what it all comes down to. The group that falls apart (or is ripped apart by beastie) needs to be able to get back together and start PLAYING the GAME faster than what is available now. I understand that you are saying that downtime due to bad play is a motivation to play well, but when that downtime is compounded with all the other downtimes... its just too much. Lemme lose xp, lemme med, lemme regen, lemme corpse retrieve, lemme do my best to play well, but when I get done doing all of those things, lemme PLAY. I really shouldnt have to spend another 30 minutes awaiting the 60th level Warrior of Doom who is schlepping his way back to the dungeon as fast his legs can carry... bah. That vision shouldnt be in anybodys "Vision" tm of how things should operate. Fix that and I am a happy camper... er... procurer of items and xp at the hands of a reoccurring randomly generated critter who may or may not have what I am seeking.<P>Shiz.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just a point I would like to bring up.<P>Many have stated that downtime is an inherent part of MMORPG's but I would disagree. <P>Look at Asherons Call. Now AC has time sinks, I'm not saying it dosen't, but it never left me feeling that feeling you get when you reach OOM in EQ and you have to sit on your backside. In AC as a melee class after a battle you could quickly and easily use the Heal skill and be back in action in moments. As a mage you could use the Stamina to Mana spell and again, be ready for action in no time. <P>It may be unfair to compare the two as the game systems are very different but AC shows that with a bit of thought, you can create an MMORPG system that dosen't leave you feeling like you spend half of your gaming time sitting down and when you got used to the teleporter system, time not doing anything was cut even further. I am not sure on this but maybe it took longer to progress in AC than EQ but I would rather this and always be doing something that sitting on my backside.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is how I see it...<P>EQ would be much more pleasant IF I could actually get a group together, and explore a dungeon.  Unfortunately, that isn't rewarded.  You get punished for such actions.  You'll incur multiple deaths, and lose much more xp than trying to work your way through a dungeon.  You have so much downtime, that after every few battles you have to sit and med/heal, etc.  And the monsters spawn on top of you.  It's move or be killed.  Well, you can't move because you have to med/heal.  It's a catch-22.  The dungeons a high level group could actually move and keep moving through won't give the group any xp, or have such poor loot because it's designed for a group 10-15 levels below them.<P>So in a sense, I feel the game is too challenging in the average dungeon.  Easing up the dungeon difficulty while keeping loot the same would help a TON.  Then put in some other constraint as to why you should be level 40 and move through the dungeon rather than being level 30-35 and camp one mob. Diminishing returns (with both loot and xp) on killing a recently killed mob would inspire the need to find new unexplored areas instead of camping.  Maybe that isn't possible, but maybe the mob that has been standing longest in the zone always drops the dungeon 'rare'.  That would mean if a party kills everything in the zone, it would atleast obtain that single dungeon rare item.<P>Just my two cents.  The mechanics dictate camping over exploration.  Exploration is punished by downtime and death.  Camping is rewarded by xp and the chance for uber loot.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here's an idea for you Brad:<P>How about a 'deep meditation state' for casters. When a caster starts meditating you start a one minute timer, and after that timer is up the mana regeneration rendered from meditation is increased a good amount if the caster is still meditating.<P>From an RP stand point this makes some sense, as a long period of meditation should be far more helpful than multiple small meditation sessions, similarly to how a good night's sleep is more refreshing than 8 hour long naps.<P>From a gameplay stand point this would mean that casters would only reduce their downtime between fights, without increasing the mana available to the casters once the fight had started as they'd need to spend a solid block of meditating to get back their mana, without improving the performance of the 'meditate, stand, cast, sit' strategy of casting.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I did a couple of boat trips and I still dont hate it (I am new, I know I will hate it eventually), but my main concern, is that whenever I get to a new city, Im just afraid of leaving it. Not being bound to a city is the most time consuming thing I can think of in Norrath, at least to under 15th players. Wouldn't it be possible to have an NPC at the entrance of the city, near the bank, or wherever that cast bind affinity on you for 5pp, or something like that? My goal is to be able to get a bind, without having to wait for a player, if you are willing to pay for it, and wait for a player if you are not. I think that will encourage more people to travel, since I think most people dont travel under fear of dying very far from their bound point.<BR>My 2 cp.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Getting groups:<BR>The game forces the player to be efficiency experts to advance.  This causes people to be very picky about who they group with, to such an extent that often people choose to solo.  why? <P>1) solo'ing is ALWAYS a lower risk (more convenient) method of character advancement;<BR>a) the soloist doesn't get himself into situations that he can't handle<BR>b) he gets full exp for every kill<BR>c) he doesn't waste time trying to get into a group<BR>d) he doesn't waste time waiting for corpse retrieval.  <P>with c) being the biggest factor, in my experience.<P>Possible solution - increase the exp bonus for being in a group and PUBLISH the exp bonus (i.e let the user group know what the bonus is).  Make the bonus dependent upon the character being added (exp sponges add more of a bonus), and upon the number being added (the sixth player adds the biggest bonus).  How many soloist  vs. groups are there in the Oasis?<P>Travel:<BR>Boat travel is only amusing the first time, after that we'd all like to teleport.  Getting a wizard/druid at the right place/time/inclination is sometimes extremely time consuming.<P>Making teleportation one of two defining traits for the wizard locks you into a position where you can't just create dragon teeth with the ability to tp the possessor.<P>How about this - make it so that the teeth hold tp charges and wizards/druids are the only class that can charge the teeth... of course, this will infuriate enchanters.  So you'll need to make it a quest, with a step (steps?) where a PC enchanter is required.<P>The Quest: The character has to assemble a "fitting" for the tooth.  A PC enchanter is needed along the way to enchant the "fitting".  The end of the quest the PC turns in the enchanted "fitting" and the tooth for a fitted tooth.  Give wizards and druids a spell that creates an item ("the orb of dislocation").  PCs with the fitted tooth can right-click the orb on the tooth to add a spell charge (teleport to dragon ring) to the fitted tooth.  [Now add a second quest for the dragon skull, the fitted teeth fit in the dragon skull (it's a box that holds dragon teeth), the dragon skull is soul bound]<P>Corpse Retrieval:<BR>Not having items on your naked body really slows things down.  Why not create a quest where no drop items can be made soul bound (you turn in the item for the exact same item, which is now soul bound).  Or, better yet, allow enchanters to create an item ("orb of remembrance"?) that, when right-clicked on an item, makes it soul-bound for one death (kinda like buying insurance on an item).<P>General:<BR>PCs only being able to (conveniently) provide SERVICES to other PCs make everyone dependent on everyone else's schedule (I have to wait around for a caster to wander into Grobb so I can get a bind).  Make more PC created one-use items (GOODS).  In short, allow PCs to provide other PCs with goods in addition to services.  <P>Clerics (revive)/ Enchanters (clarity)/ Druid's and Shaman (SOW)/ Wizards and Druids (teleport) are all PLAYER characters - they are all PLAYING the game.  Few, if any, PCs think being a revive/clarity/sow/tp dispenser is a fun way of playing.<P>If they knew that they could make a good buck by setting aside some time to create charges for items that other characters could use later, it might be an interesting sideline while they were waiting to get into groups.<P>[For instance, allow a cleric to cast revive on an expensive gem, this give the gem a single charge of revive, dead player may then take the gem back to his body to revive it.  If you think that it would prevent misuse - make such a gem, a lore item]<P>I'm sure that you see balance issues with all of this, but I've played a wizard, and to tell you the truth, I frequently simply ignore other players requests for tp's because I'm engaged in another activity at the time.  If I had a way to create items that contained charges, I'd probably spend a portion of my time (like when I couldn't get a group) creating those items.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am amazed that people who come whining about exp loss, binding/travel issues and long CR time would have the audacity to insult me for disliking penalties suffered for BS deaths.<P>We play EQ to have fun. Running all over the place, waiting for boats, begging for ports or rezzes because some green NPC attacked you for a slip of mind is NOT FUN! It is also un-called for. <P>The ubber-guard upgrade they made is one of my pet peaves. Level 30 guards in FV or Veliuos hitting for 500 a pop is complete BS. I got killed by some ubber quest NPC running thru WK and lost lvl 50. Oh what fun!<P>You people complain about down time, I complain about time requirements period! Every change they have made to the game recently ADDS to time requirements. Longer travel time, longer time to get the personell needed to do any dungeon, longer time travelling thru even older zones because you have to take great care not to run into the new high level mobs there. A level 50 can't even go thru lesser Fay anymore without taking great care not to run into Brownie Scouts, or if your a good race the Dark Elves.<P>I don't need your flames telling me how stupid I was in those situations where I died foolishly, I already know that. My point was that instead of fun game time, I spent a great deal of non-fun downtime simply because I made a mistake in an out-of-combat situation. A situation where there was ABSOLUTLY NO CHANCE OF REWARD. I was not traveling thru dengerous territoy nor even in a place where I was not liked (the guy was wrong who was talking about me taking a good char to an evil city - except for the Freeport Militia ubber gate guards). When there is no chance of reward, the risk should be miniscule, as should the penalty suffered because of a simple screw up.<P>While those who flamed me may get enjoyment out of getting plastered by a green NPC who is normally freindly to you, or getting whipped by some ubber-guard with no chance of escape, I do not. The experience lost and three hours we spent getting our corpses from underneath VOX I can accept as a reasonable penalty, because the potential reward was very great. Getting backstabbed by a green guard for over 1000 points because I did not realize he would be KOS to wolfform had absolutly no potential reward, yet the loss was the same (don't say I should have known they were KOS to wolves. I just got the spell that level, and I don't go and gouge myself on all the spoiler boards before I go to an area).<P>Sorry if I rambelled, just the responses I got to my previous post miffed me a tad.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044924-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044924.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044924-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044924-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044924-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044924-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044924-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=044924&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=044924&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
