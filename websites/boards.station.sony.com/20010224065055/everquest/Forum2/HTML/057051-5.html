</FONT><HR>The biggest beef I have with ALL the classes which rely heavily on research is there are the stupid spell drops don't happen enough and don't seem to happen in all areas where mobs of the appropriate levels are found.<P>If I am an Iksar Necro level 16 I can't go to Grobb to get my 16 pet so the mobs in Lake of Ill Omen and Swamp of no hope ought to drop the component spells to make the level 16 pet.  Not maybe they should.  Not we think they probably do.  <P>They don't drop.<P>What exactly is a level 16 Necro supposed to do?  Fight with his level 12 pet until level 20?  This same thing goes for mages.  Why make the game such a pain and so difficult for someone who just wants to log on for an hour and have some fun hunting this or that with friends to have this person effectively taken out of the hunt for hours to attempt to locate pages and research a thing as VITAL and expected as a pet?<P>Yes it's expected.  Does Verant ever try to test a Level 16 Mecro fighting with a level 12 pet and crappy gear in their testing.  Ya what are the odds.  We all know they don't but you create the chance that this is exactly what your players are playing with because of how this research was designed.  Why not test with that people actually PLAY WITH?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Screw liftaps on uber mobs, and everything else...<P>GIVE US BACK OUR WARRIOR PETS.<P>I am sure everyone who plays a necro gets used to having warrior pets 1 to 49.<BR>Then they work hard to get 53, for a rogue that Doesn't Evade = Dead quick. Then 56 a monk that doesn't FD = dead quick.<BR>So people spend mass time and money per month playing a class and no changes in pets. Then all of a sudden their pets get NERFED.<P>This is NOT a soloing issue.<BR>Necros need warrior pets post 50 for a few different reasons.<BR>1) BASH = Interrupting Spells. (frogs gating in Sebilis anyone?? )<BR>2) Higher AC/HPs = When a ranger,warrior,SK, pally is in trouble, they can back off and let the pet tank a little. ( common practice pre 51 )<P>Warrior pets for Necros and Mages don't improve soloing much. Anyone who solos post 52 is missing out on a lot of fun and loot in dungons anyway.<BR>Bringing warrior pets back into the game post 50 will do one MAJOR thing though... It will improve the grouping experience, and ablity of a group to live longer.<P>Then again if you want players to DIE more often. I can see why you don't want post 50 warrior pets.<BR> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/confused.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You can read the previous discussion here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055864.html<BR>And here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056034.html<BR>And here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056290.html<BR>And here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056604.html <P>Author Topic: Necromancer Talk <BR>Absor<BR>Station Member posted 02-07-2001 10:08 AM <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>So let's talk about necromancers.<BR>As with all the other threads, I want to talk about class balance here, not about bugs or epic weapons. You may certainly present bugs and concerns about the epic weapons, but they will not be the main concern of this thread. <BR>Will they ever be a concern ?..<BR>Unlike the other threads, I have a fairly good list of ideas already garnered from several other posts to start us out. It is not complete, I'm sure. But it is certainly a good place to start our discussion. <BR>What Ideas you keep posting the same thing over and over no feed back?..<BR>Also, we are not looking to make necromancers any more effective at soloing than they already are.<BR>Sorry to inform you but Druids are the best Solo class ..<BR> And, well, the necromancer is a pretty powerful class as they are now. <BR>Powerful at what ?.. Fear .Snare. Lifetap. Dots.<BR>Fear is not group friendly In dungeons. Dots for a class that are suppose to be masters of dots and time, Why is it that even as a master of my class still doesn’t improve on the time of the Dots bad class of all timers maybe ?..<BR>The primary issues that I see revolve around the battle with the boss monsters.<BR>No this is not the only problem ! We can barely group among our own class let alone other class’s.  Even if the lifetaps were to land on these boss mobs how many Nec to you think would even prove useful on a raid anyway considering that ONLY ONE! Nec out the few there can cast Dots and that providing that its not one of the Dots that WONT Stack with the Shaman or Enchanter class..  What you think that there going to bring lots of Nec on raids to life tap it to death ??? I think not ..And this doesn’t include the problem that all caster class are having with FIZZLES and RESIST! …I don’t see (Warrior’s Slash is resisted) (Paladins bash is resisted) (Rouge fizzle is dagger and drops it)….<P> But I certainly want to hear from necromancers with concerns about all levels of the game.<BR>Well if the the according to you is relatively balanced for Nec PRE 50.  Then there is no reason to nerf the LICH line PRE 50 .. That the only Nerf to the Lich line to establish balance. Would be post 50 to receive improvements in other areas <BR> And, once again, I have to warn you that since we will be looking closely at this class we may very well feel that something needs to have its power reduced to achieve balance. <BR>Like this is any thing new Nec have be Nerfed after Nerf .. I think you should take a close look at post 50 .. Cast times ..Dot duration times .. what is a 2minute Dots going to do in a 30 second or less Encounter ?.. And even still if the Encounter lasted longer my first 30 Seconds have been wasted in cast time with MINIMAL damage ?? Every ones dead even before my dots finish ?..<BR>Anyhow, here's what I have already. <BR>Ignite Bones: The real reason that you don’t want to remove the effect is the 12  Second Delay to cast the spell the effect let the caster know its time to cast again ..  <BR>Chill Bones (55). Upgrade to Ignite bones some upgrade same 12 Second restriction and 10 more damage ? Same crapy cast time ? At the least how about a real DD spell that would prove useful on raids 250Mana 580Dmg 6Second cast time Instant recast.<BR>Lifetaps: The number one request is to allow Lifetaps to land on the big monsters. If we are telling necromancers that they have a valid place at the final encounter because they can give mana to other casters, then they will need a way to regain mana. Lich and Lifetap are the way they do that now. I am not convinced that this is something that we should change. But this is the single most asked for thing by the necromancer community. Perhaps, if made in conjunction with the fixing the bug in Lich, then perhaps this could be balanced. <BR>Still Even in a raid of 30 people only one Nec can cast Dots see above .. If per chance that more then one Nec are allowed on a raid At least the other Nec can life tap <BR>DoTs and corpse poofing: This affects everyone. Hopefully this is now much improved, but I’m not taking it off the list until I’m convinced it has been fixed. <BR>Until you stand behind your belief that this has been fixed .. Most Guild still wont allow Nec to cast Dot on Important raids.. In fear of a recap. Because the GM Wont do anything about it. If it happens ?. <BR>Mana transfer: Again, if their ‘place’ against the boss mob is to transfer mana, then perhaps we should allow them to do it at a better rate. A 2:1 transfer rate might be enough. I'm not at all certain that this should be done in conjunction with any change to Lifetaps in those encounters, though, as a change in one makes the other far more effective and might just be too much of a change. But this could certainly be considered if we fix the bug with the Lich spells. <BR>I don’t think your afraid of our class in general or even pumping the Wizard with mana .. or any other caster for that matter your fear of this spell is pumping mana into a cleric ?..<BR>Infusion: Make infusion targetable. The necro might still see it as a 'worthless spell', but if another caster wants to sacrifice their experience for 1000 mana, they might actually cast this spell. Otherwise, those Essence Emerald’s will only be used for raising the dead. <BR>Ya Right I want to lose 6 hour + even days worth of game play to get 1000Mana ?.. Sure why not useless spell any how there choice I guess.<BR>Defoliation: There seem to be plenty of plants that this just doesn't work on. I fully understand how we need to limit the use of any spell that is overly efficient against any one monster type. But it might be worthwhile to evaluate the things that are not considered plants that maybe should be. I've asked the players for a list that they'd like reviewed, but I've received nothing yet. <BR>Epic Weapon: The look and effect are not well loved in the community. <BR>There are 3 things that would make a Nec epic. Well EPIC  weapon sommond corpse no component.. BIG Damage Fast .. Regen .. And I only say regen because there is an item in the game that does exist and a lot of Nec are considering moving to this for there Epic weapon .. But I’m sure you are considering nerfing this item as well ..<P>Lich Series: This series of spells is broken. It is more powerful than it should be. It takes the necromancer's hit points and turns them into mana. It was calculated at a certain ratio to be 'in balance'. Unfortunately, these spells were adversely affected by the reduction of damage to spells used by players on players. This change also reduced the hit points taken from the necromancer by Lich spells, so that the ratio of mana gained for hit points lost is nearly 1 for 1 (instead of about 3 for 2). This is a bug that we have chosen not to change in the past because it would be a 'nerf'. I think in conjunction with a serious look at the entire class and the balance of all the classes, we should also look at this series and decide if we should put it right. If it remains as it is, the necromancer is going to be limited in the improvements it can gain, as the class is already using a powerful and broken spell series. Note: Series includes: Arch Lich (60), Demi Lich (60), Lich (49), Call of Bones (34), Allure of Death (20). <BR>So conserned about this ? But still haven’t told us what we could gain to lose this ?..<BR>Considering all of the other balance issue’s in the game what about Modulation rod? Canabalize? Wont give cleric there pet back because of buffs and heals .. But give Shaman Way better heal that has a better pet then that cleric pet ever was and also considering to give them a better pet ? I think the problem here is not the healing it the mobs that QUAD for 800 damage and have 300,000 HP or more ?…<BR>People have been posting and posting and posting Were’s the feed back ?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Idea on &lt; IGNITE BONES &gt;,<P>Problem = The current graphics confuse tanks but we cant get rid of it without changing the gist of the spell<P>Solution = Change the graphic / this also gives us the chance, to make it a spell, that HELPS us be more wanted in High level groups. OK here it goes.  Make the MOB turn into its own corpse graphic!!  It would sort of Feign Death.  This would of course cause a stun effect, so Verant may want to shorten the effect.  Lengthening the recast time would offset the benefit we would recieve in the Solo arena.  I would also suggest leaving the fire graphic that is currently on the spell.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Qque,<P>Its not so much the graphic itself that messes things up. A Good tank will already have the mob targeted and know where it is. The biggest problem lies in the size of the graphic. Big dragon goes poof into little skele, suddenly you have 30 to 40 yards of space between where the tanks were hitting the dragon and the now skele formed dragon. This causes a break in the action which in turn can cause tanks to miss out on a round or two of damage, and that can make a large difference in battles won and lost. <P>Upon such time as the effect wears off, the dragon expands back into dragon form and now all your tanks are inside the dragon polygon body, now you have all the tanks getting the "You cant see your target from here." message and missing out on another round or two of damage.<P>Any good tank can see the size difference between a Necromancers pet and the ignite bones skele graphic. They also know the shortcuts to targeting and retargeting the mobs. Some tanks may get confused, but your best tanks will be able to tell the difference.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This post is targetted at the purpose of this thread – the final class balancing of the Necro.<BR>A quick comment: I do understand that there are MANY complexities to balancing a class that most of us are incapable of considering due to the non-transparent nature of the details of the game mechanics. My concern herein is that with the magnitude of the task – issues that were once dealt with will not be reconsidered even though things may have changed significantly since then.<P>*Alan said:<BR>"Also, we are not looking to make necromancers any more effective at soloing than they already are. And, well, the necromancer is a pretty powerful class as they are now."<P>Alan, please don't buy into the Necro all-powerful "hype" immediately. Do some reasonable comparisons in situations and environments that VI feels are appropriate for the game they/you envision. Obviously that will be the game you will endeavor to promote, and scenarios other than those are going to become progressively more meaningless.<P>Our "power" is repeatedly based upon our ability to fight a single, low magic resistant mob in an open outdoor zone, or in a dungeon with pathing problems. This is a small part of a Necro’s life, and it is unfair and unreasonable to summarize our class with such an isolationist view. Consider our power compared to the abilities of the other classes in the same situations.<P>The progression of "power" of different classes against the Necro class is another consideration, in times gone by things were very different. Changes in the past were made due to game mechanics then which are now very different from when those changes were deemed appropriate. There are some very knowledgeable people on these boards who have been around for a long time. There is a history to the power of a necro that has been discussed in various proses throughout these threads. Zrazzt seems to know as much as anyone about this.<P>Consider balancing our class according to soloabiliy, groupability, and raidability. Do not forget to consider the effectiveness of multiple necros in a group vs. other classes in the same situations.<P>In addition, remember our faction and trade/banking penalties.<P>An interesting side-effect of increasing the group experience bonuses is that Necromancers have less of an opportunity to take advantage of this than more group-friendly classes (by definition). This is actually yet another (small, but tangible) negative effect of being a Necro. <P>*Alan said:<BR>“The primary issues that I see revolve around the battle with the boss monsters.”<P>Please do not limit your consideration to the top 1% of players in 1% of scenarios...this is supposed to be the final balance of the class.<P><BR>*Alan said:<BR>“But I certainly want to hear from necromancers with concerns about all levels of the game. And, once again, I have to warn you that since we will be looking closely at this class we may very well feel that something needs to have its power reduced to achieve balance.”<P>A very reasonable statement. But look closely – PLEASE. I have no doubt that if you all leave preconceptions at the door, and perform a fair assessment of the Necro class in various scenarios, you will come out with a far more realistic view of where we stand in the GRAND scheme of things.<P>Damn…can’t finish.<BR>Happy Valentines day!<P>Cophin Sliwryn<BR>Necromancer<BR>Knights of Vallon<BR>Vallon Zek<P>Our power, our variety, should in part and as a whole, remain Necromancy; and we as academics of pestillence and death, must always be Necromancers.<P><BR>P.S.<P>New spell:<BR>Shadow Travel:<BR>Very fast movement with levitate in the form of a shadow (like in City of Mist), possibly useable only at night. Costs include draining health and/or mana and/or stamina, perhaps a component requirement.<BR>Characteristically Necroish to see a bunch of shadowed Necro's "flying" across a zone at night.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>VI<P>I believe we, your customer base, are owed something here.  We anticipated this opportunity to communicate with you would at least be recognized and acknowledged.  We hoped it would be used as a forum to bring Necromancers back into a position that causes us to be, at least, acceptable if not respected in the game.  Unfortunately when our thread was opened, the opening came with veiled threats of additional nerfs, and a statement saying we are already a powerful class not needing any enhancements.<P>&gt;&gt;And, well, the necromancer is a pretty powerful class as they are now.<P>&gt;&gt;And, once again, I have to warn you that since we will be looking closely at this class we may very well feel that something needs to have its power reduced to achieve balance<P>This attitude would seem to be counter productive if you really are seeking well considered thoughtful responses and not intending to threaten players with the Nerf Axe if they don't step lightly and sing your toon.<P>I am not accusing you of not reading these posts, but some feedback would seem to be appropriate.  Many of us are very interested in having a dialogue regarding our class.  Not posting endlessly to board were we get no response.  Reading some of the other class boards there seems to be much more feedback from VI on those threads than we have received here.  Please be fair in this, and allow us to communicate (communication cannot be accomplished via a one way interface).  Thus far I have read many well thought out very literate explanations of problems and descriptions of potential solutions to those problems.  This is exactly what you asked for.  But no response has been posted.<P>I posted some small items earlier in this series of threads and will only add that anyone that would make a statement that states or even implies that Necromancers are more powerful in early levels than other classes and need to be balanced because of their "Soloability" has not played the game as a Necro in the last year or more and has certainly not played as a Druid.  If you do not understand this statement, I invite you to Timorous Deep for a little demonstration.<P>1 Necro + Pet<P>1 Druid<P>Necro and pet pull a single raptor, fight it tell it is dead, then sit to med for X minutes.<P>Druid pulls 4 raptors simultaneously, kills all four, sits to med for X+3 minutes.<P>The Druid experiences longer individual down time, but more than makes up for it in experience gained over time.  Lets not even factor in the other variables associated with re-supplying food and items (regeants etc)(Druid can forage = doesn't have to worry about food)(Druid TP + Welcome in most cities + SOW/Wolfform = very little time spent not fighting, and lots of options for selling/banking).<P>This is, of course, not limited to TD, but can be seen happening in many different zones against many different mobs through out the world of EQ.<P>The above description being 100% factual and verifiable, if necessary please look me up I would be happy to setup a demonstration for you, please stop using that old worn out line about Necro's being too powerful.  It may have been true a very long time ago, but you made sure that you corrected, even over-corrected, that problem a long time ago as well.<P>You may take offense to the tone of this message, but offense is not what I am after.  I am after a reaction, an affirmation that the people posting sincere requests for support of a, here to date, unsupported even openly disapproved of class, have been heard.  And that you VI will at least make some effort at fairness and impartiality when reviewing this forum and when considering changes to be made in game.<P>Thank You</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Heh, you know, I used to laugh when I saw people post things like "Verant hates Necromancers!". I thought, how could the company that created the class hate the class? I mean, isnt that self defeating, not to mention degrading your own product? <P>No, Im not going to say I now think VI hates Necros, but I do begin to wonder if there is a resentment towards the Necro community. Ive read through some of the other class talk threads and in comparison Id say most of them are no different than this one as far as attitude and maturity level are concerned. There are some threads that get very heated and the maturity level takes a nose dive. Yet they still get communication, and none of their threads started with "Well, we may just nerf you again. Youre still overpowered afterall."<P>Like every other time we have taken a nerf, or we have been shamed or bashed publicly, weve managed to take it in stride as a community of players. Weve adapted and weve come back fighting. I think this time however may be the end of the line. VI has heard "If you nerf this, Im quitting my Necro" so many times, its like the boy who cried wolf. We kept playing and we worked around it best we could. But I think this time, alot of people might be more serious than Verant gives them credit for. As it stands now the Necro class is a very "unfun" (if thats even a word) class to play. Its wraught with long casting spells that never get to see their total potential, high resist rates on our fastest most effective spells, pets that wet themselves on impact, and a reputation based on mythical stories and long nerfed abilities. The game is supposed to be fun for all classes. We should all be able to participate and take an active part (notice I said active, not sitting on our butts medding for someone else) in events, raids, explorations, and various other encounters throughout the game. <P>Does Verant hate Necros? No. I dont think they do. <BR>Does Verant resent the Necro community? Possibly. <BR>Would they openly admit it? Heck no.<P>  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok I really need to ask this.<P>Absor what's the big worry about enhancing the ability of necro's to solo.  All the info available for a person before buying/installing EQ sayas that the Necro is the solo class.  YET, Druids, Wizards, And (saw today for the first time) Magicians have AE Spells that HAVE gotten BETTER in the high level that allow them to quad kite.  I was watching a 57 magician Quad kiting Otters in CS for exp.  So why do we worry about enhancing THE SOLO class's ability to SOLO when there are many other class's that SOLO better than Necro's.<P>So I have to ask.  Why the concern about improving our ability to solo?<P>Thuldorn<BR>53 Necro<BR>Karana</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Heh, Necromancers are not the most powerful solo class. <P>I wish, I hope, I pray that Verant/Absor would post specifics on this and post comparative examples using Druids, Magicians, Shaman, Wizards, Bards and Enchanters.<P>In an honest assessment there is not ONE situation where one of these classes can’t better solo a spawn than Necromancers can.  Post your examples where you believe that a Necromancer can solo better than these other classes.  Your player base would shred that example.<P>Oh but fact goes against the undocumented Vision™ doesn't it?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>So that I'm not misunderstood.<P>At least one of the other classes mentioned can solo a spawn/npc better/more efficiently than a necromancer can in specific situations.  That’s the problem with generalizations.  Once you get specific it’s easy to point out that, “No a Druid can solo that more efficiently than a necromancer can.” <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>here we go with your examples:<P>-wizzards/druids can quad kite up to 54 for better xp in td and bw.<BR>-mages can solo the zone entrance of high level dungeons better then a necro*chardok comes in mind*.when fear isnt a option and the pet has to tank,the mages are superior.<BR>-shamans can solo the sebilis zone frogs with slow/speed/dd/pet/dot.<BR>-i saw a mage with epic pet soloing a KRUP knight in sebilis.no necro with the*so called*epic weapon would survive that.<P>i am sure,i forgot some examples.<P>when fear kite is a option,then necros are good soloers,but only with jboots.druids get sow at level 14,while a necro must risk alot by soloing until he gets his jboots in 40+ typicaly.<P>damnd,even my 31er warrior can solo extremley well with less downtime in lake of ilomen much better ans safer then a necro.ok,he has a great armor and weapons,which were a present of a friend <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">,but atleast he can solo well.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>*phew* it took quite some time reading thru ALL the threads regarding necro balancing, but i made it!...:=)<P>I started a necro back in the day with 2 main goals<BR>1: to be able to be the first to solo Lady Vox...( yeah yeah yeah ambitious, but i believed it:=))<P>2: get a Rod of Annihilation, and astonish ppl with my melee power...<P>This is what has happened to my two main goals of the game:<P>1: Vox can no longer be encountered when u have passed the lvl of 52... i.e. cannot be soloed...<P>2: RoA is taken out of the game...ie i have to locate it on a player who got it back in the day... and they prolly stopped playing...<P>On a side note to u who laugh when i said i wanted to solo Vox, bear this in mind... i have soloed PoD at even con (50) he has 32k HP as well...but the surroundings are a little better i admit ( did it in Gfay)<P>My new goals of this game was to be able to do the big encounters, get hold of an Artifact, or in some way mark myslef in the community as a renowned player with good skills...<P>Can u, Verant, tell me how this is possible if i cannot get a group?<P>Yes, i know u cannot determine how ppl feel about other classes, but as u can clearly see this is an overall opinion of players.<BR>THe sad part is, a necro can be EXTREMELY usefull in a group. WE practically have all the spellvarieties of the game.<P>to give u who have doubts about a necros abilities i have a little story.<P>I was in Karnors Castle doing the usual. LFG no respone routine of a necro, when i, with a little agression approached a group which held only 5 players. They hesitatedm but finally let me in the group( i am sure they did only because of conscience). WE were 2 shaman's, a warrior, a rogue and a mage. The 2 shamans made it out as slower healers, and the rest new their stuff. <BR>At the beginning they almost INSTRUCTED me how to play, until they began to realize, that i played my character well. I started being the enchanter in the group, and got appreciative responsives after each fight such as, wow didnt know u could do that, and so forth. Then a time came where one shammy left, and another mage was let into the group. It started off worrying the warrior, as he didnt believe in the healing powers of a shammy, didnt think he would heal fast enough. We tried and it worked fine. <BR>Suddenly the shammy had to go, and noone was LFG in the zone...<BR>The warrior immediatly decided that we could not go on, and i decided to play alittle trick on him. I made a bet with him about an item, that if he could manage not to pull more than 2 at a time( i pushed his ego, stating about his puller abilities, and of course the warrior could pull SO GOOD, hehe ) we would be able to do this fine. He pulled, and naturally, even tho he was cautious and afraid of his life, pulled 2, a healer and a named!(noncaster). I immediatly cast Pact of Shadow on the Warrior, and Screaming terror on the healer... sicked in Pet on the named(was Scryer i think ) and BoD on it....i kept the healer Screamed and insta healed the warrior when nessecary, after the fight was over the warrior had lost 1 bub of HP and i was at full with about 1/2 my mana left, BoD still working, and Lich on me... After that we kept pulling in the group for 4 more hours, letting in another mage, because the warrior had now decided that it was more important with damage output..haha<BR>btw if screaming T wore of prior to time, i FD'ed wnet up and rescreamed...<BR>I have some friends who would more than LOVE to have a necro in their group after them seeing how good a necro can be in groupsituations. We have the largest variety of spells in game, making us the Jack-of-all-trades when it comes to spellcasters. The problem is, that not many ppl play this very well. And yes, i am saying that some ppl play necros BAD, and that has been a big comtributor in creating the reason why necros have a bad group reputation.<P>What i see as the main problem with necros today are the fact that we have nogood spells in boss encounters. I truly cannot see the problem with DoT stacking, i really cant. If it is because of the mana efficiency, why dont u just simply decrease the efficiency rate of the spells?<BR>Seems pretty simple to me, and something i believe not many will flame over...<P>Necros are the hardest character inthis game to play, and that is what have created the grouping problem. Do any of u guys want a player who plays bad in ur group? i think not! neither do i! but this problem which should have been related to the player behind the character, has now emerged UPON the character.<BR>Solution? Verant u need to rethink the Necro post 50 game. Ur intentions are great, but perhaps u made it too hard for nonpowergamers. U have to know ur capabilities EXTREMELY well to efficient as a necro, but most ppl choose a necro because they can solo, thus casual play! This is not in context with how a necro should be played, therefore, rethink the necro!<BR>U see what i mean? here is an equation:<P>Casualgamer + HARD-character-to-play = unwanted player/character<P>The few ppl who have played with a REALLY good necro will know what i am talking about.<P>I am sorry if some ppl in the necrocommunity feels that i step on tehm, but not all ppl are suited for this character, just like not all ppl are suited for being President or being in the handyman business<BR>ANd that makes u think...if it comes to this, that a player cant choose to play a class because he is not 'suited' for it, isnt it too hard?<BR>What i encourage u to do, Verant, is to look at ur definition of teh class( i am sure u have definitions of every class ) and compare it to the outcome, do those things match? if they do, please give us the definition, that will shut a lot of ppl up, or...<BR> MAKE THAT CHANGE!<P>I for one didnt start a necro if i knew the result would be support!<P>a side note Verant...<BR>I have seen u commenting on that ur tired of hearing the word NERF...well WE are tired of hearíng the phrase: Necros are pretty/Very/Uber powered as it is...<BR>Take THAT! ( no, not the boybad...:=P )<P>Vizjeri, Heretic of the Karana( U GOT THAT RIGHT! i didnt SPLIT THE SERVER!)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057051-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057051.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057051-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057051-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057051-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057051-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057051&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057051&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
