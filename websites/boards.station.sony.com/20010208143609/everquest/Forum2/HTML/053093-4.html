</FONT><HR>Many things discussed, many things touched upon that I think are worth discussing.<P>There are a few issues that need to be addressed that I think people aren't keeping track of, however.<P>1 Taunt - Yes, Taunt is ineffective at high levels.  It would be good if it could be improved so that warriors aren't just mashing the taunt button every few seconds.  Perhaps a new version of taunt that has a longer (say, twice as long) cycle time, but has a significantly higher chance for forcing the warrior to the top of the hate list.  That way choosing to hit 'taunt' becomes an actual TACTICAL decision as opposed to what it mostly is now:  Mash the non-grey button!<P>2 Disarm - Yes, disarm is a 'useless' skill as far as its original intent (disarming the enemy to reduce their damage output).  It has limited usefulness in a very specific situation (mobs armed with low-delay fine steel, for instance)<P>However, I know that I always use disarm.  Why?  because it's another skill that bumps me up the hate list, I've found.  Maybe i'm giving away some kind of 'uber warrior secret' (yeah right), but I have found that if i do a properly timed taunt/slam/disarm, I can force a mob to turn to me at pre-45 levels.  post 45 is still broken, taunt wise, but this &gt;is&lt; a valid use for disarm that I think people are missing.<P>Re: crippling blows.  Well, generally i couldn't care less about crippling blows, but when you combine it with the discipline that sets all blows to be criticals, it becomes the exact 'do or die' discipline that someone was talking about.  I've seen a single warrior use that combo for amazing amounts of damage in seconds.<P>What would I like to see improved for warriors?<P>Taunt.<P>Yeah, the epic weapon could be better, yadda yadda, etc, etc.  But if you want to know what skills/abilities as a class I think need improvement:<P>Taunt.<P>That's it.<P>Bias Schmias<BR>52nd Warrior<BR>Glossolalia, The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It's funny.  We all have a chance to say something about our classes here.  It's a golden opportunity to bring up those little things that just never seemed right about them, and every thread is filled with 3/4 of the people not asking for balance, but asking to never die.  The result is the things each class needs is overlooked because of all the spam.<BR>     I have read a lot of this thread and have never played a warrior.  But from the posts i can easily see that taunt is a real issue for a warrior.  I wish more people could take this opportunity to look at what they NEED and not bring up their fantasies.  More dmg.. more hp's.. spells... there are some real absurd issues being brought up here.  Help the poor tanks taunt!  They obviously need it.  Please ignore the fools asking for their character to be the champion of the world.<BR>     Also saw something about having a higher chance to hit for full dmg when back is turned.. makes sense since most mobs dont wield weapons or shields on their backsides and it would help with the taunting.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think if you made Cobalt armor drop more often and No drop, it would help warriors drastically. Every time I see Cobalt for sale in EC A) its not a warrior selling it and B) its like 15,000plat or higher... thats a god load of money, by making it No drop, people couldnt sell it, And correct me if Im wrong... but isnt there ~usually~ a warrior in High lvl groups? Id much rather go to Karnors and loot my Class armor then buy it from some Pharmers for ridiculassly high amounts.<P>Daleen Dangerz<BR>Erollisi Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think the warrior class just needs some improvements.<P>Defense after 200 is a pain to raise.  I'v takening thousands of hits since 41(therotical level to max it following formual of (lvl + 1) x 5). I currently have 208 defense and I'm level 45. 201+ defense raises very slowly, especially when we get 40 additional points post 50. It would be great if defence raised a bit faster per level.<P>Taunt is another important warrior ability post 50 that is very difficult. Its the warriors only ability to turn the mob on oneself. With the current post 50 Taunt function of only blue cons to the warrior that can taunt less effectively then compared to blue cons pre-50. Personally, I think the Taunt cap should be raised to about 225 or taunt is less effective on 54+ creatures on cons ranging from green to red or both.<P>Bind wound cap at 51+ levels should raise faster so we don't have to wait til 60 to bind to 70 percent. Perhaps having the warrior reach a skill of 201 or greater to bind to 70% by lvl 55 or so.<P>I am also for increased drops on Cobolt bracers and helms as well as the breastplate being made lighter then the heavy 20 stones it weighs(heavest Kunark class armor there is!).  And maybe change the effect of the gauntlets from Reckless Strentgh to say, Yaulp 1(?) with a casting time between 6-8 seconds.<P>Epic drops on some of the harder mobs required (Queen, Spiroc Lord, Maestro) should drop more often.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>-I would like to see a Discipline/Skill/Whatever allowing ALL MELEE to BIND THEMSELVES ANYWHERE. If you wish to limit it somehow make it have an insane refresh rate. I think it is rediculous that we have to continue on being bound in city zones. It is a double penalty placed on melee. Not only do we die and lose exp but now we gotta walk/run all the way back for another go at it. Not everyone has a Perma-Cleric to Rez them back from far off areas and I am sure that Clerics will still make thier cash for EXP rezzes. This cuts down playtime bigtime and game enjoyment goes down the tubes if you have a bad night. Hell just running from Arena to Cazic Thule after death is enough to bore me to tears. Make it a lvl 50 deal if you must.<BR>-This will take care of your recoding the zones for melee.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Hello everyone, Well everyone has pretty much covered everything I wanted to state and some people more. I would just like to state these few things.<P>First of all ,... No Deities. Why worship gods when you can kill them, besides what about those of us that are agnostic? End Subject.<P>Secondly Warriors gave up the right to cast spells for Hp, Ac, and large Damage. As a Warrior I am not seeing huge differences in these areas. <P>Also to all the Sks Pallies and rangers or bards out there ,... cry! If you want more ac more hp and more damage,... become a Warrior for hp and ac or a monk for damage and ac or a rogue for damage. You waived your right to whine by gaining spells and sks,.. sit down and shut up,.. you have pets, I will leave it at that.<P>I personally think that Warriors are meant to do the massive amount of damage in every game (other than EQ). In this game I chose to be a Warrior cause I thought that's what I would get. Boy was I fooled. After 52 levels of playing I still am seeing no big difference in damage AC and HP then the other tanks. <P>A word on Monks. <BR>I somehow had the image in my mind that a damsel in destress was saved by her kight in shinning armor who hath saleth the mighty dragon. When did it ever say that the knight was a scantly clad deity freak with silk wraps all over who used his fists to kill? Monks should NOT out damage Warriors, period. I find it quite offensive that I spend all my time and hard work to get all the items I need to be the best I am at what I do only to find out that I, as a matter of hapstance, am not the best I am at what I do. I am not even second best at what I do. A monk is first, and a rogue is second. Rogues should be high end damage dealers, but I am willing to share the limelight with a rogue seeing as how I can go toe to toe with a mob at least twice as long as your ordinary shadow-garden variety rogue.<P>Problems with our class.<P>Firstly We need more Hp's more AC and more Damage dealing potential. The crips crits and average hits are a huge let down in my opinion. If that is a problem then make us have a higher swing ratio, let us at least attack faster and do more of that crappy damage than more damage per swing.<P>More strength upon character creation. Even though you can pick an ogre/troll/barabarian if you want more strength, I think the Warrior class as a whole deserves more str. upon creation. Same goes for sta., as well as a higher HP output for upping the stamina stat.<P>Magic resistance, I am pleased with the MR factor that Warriors get ,.. wouldn't hurt or imbalance us to give us some more.<P>Stuns, Stuns, and more STUNS.<BR>Warriors should stun the same if not better than a mob. When I get hit and spin, boy I can't tell you the anger that gets pent up inside, if you are gonna stun Warriors then make them able to return the favor. I am not referring to the pointless kick that does absolutely nothing, the bash ability because you are of large race (*cough* nerf!*cough*), or the shield fiasco, I mean everytime I swing i deserve a 50% chance that I stun AND INTERRUPT the target. As a Warrior it is quite degrading to spin like a caster, at least let me have the potential do accomplish the same.<P>Frankly, Warrior taunt is now a Joke!<BR>The two highest damage dealers in the game, neither of which being Warriors mind you, can now taunt more effectively than our little button ever could. It's called Uber Epics! Both of which are easier to get than ours. 40% haste,... wow VI hates their Warriors! Monk epics and Rogue epics are too easy to complete, and are much better than a Warrior's epic. Sure the two hander to one hander thing is nifty, but in the end it becomes just a hard novelty item to get, and hang on the shelf to collect the virtual dust.<P>Disciplines?<BR>Disciplines are so far the best taunt in the game, I mean I am taunted to use them ,... but they suck! Why give a Warrior an ability that has no practical use what so ever! There are two good disciplines, the rest are subject matter for the worst super hero abilities chapter in mad magazine. Whom ever came up with these time recasts and small bonuses ,.. should be fired.<BR>I get hit less but I hit less. I do twice as much damage but take twice as much damage. ummm is this guy an art major? He take poetry in highschool? Does he think he is a comedian, cause this is funny and not all at the same time, like Jerry Lewis this is annoying and doesn't fly over here in America.<P>Please, make the Warriors happy that they chose to have that middle bar empty and give us something worth while and something to be happy about our class.<P>In the end I have this to summize.<BR>More Hps more ac more dmg plz thx~<BR>Stun like mobs plz thx~<BR>Easier epic weapon plz thx~<BR>Bards, Rangers, Shadowknights, Paladins, Shhhhhh! Plz thx~<BR>Warrior Taunt,.. Bwhahahahahahaha! Ahem! Sorry.<BR>Nerf monk damage or make us do more plz thx~<BR>Working in non laughable disciplines plz thx~<P>And thank you for reading.<P>Ghazzkull<BR>52nd Warrior with too many days played (74)<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Oh no…. I am sooooo sorry! I forgot that there was a level pre-requisite to post on this string! Gee, I must have missed the notification that said “You must be over level 30 to post in this string!” Drat. Ok before I continue… I just hafta ask… did I say anything that was right? Or did I have to agree with every single previous post to do that? We now know that ParadiseL thinks I’m full of it, what about my other ideas? <P>ParadiseL<BR>I think the comment regarding the splitpaw covered your lvl and length in game at least with your warrior char.<P>What is this supposed to mean? Are you mad because I didn’t call it by its “proper” name? A Split Paw? I was drawing a comparison between the fictional “first aid kit” and the properties of the A Split Paw. The A Split Paw has an effect called Dance of the Fireflies. (Kinda like the spell of the same name…) You activate the effect by clicking on the A Split Paw, and you get a light globe or a globe of light or whatever you call it. I don’t remember what it is called exactly, damn my newbie eyes.  I was trying to say that the fictional “first aid kit” would have a fictional effect such as “heal” and required the “bind wound” skill to use. If you missed that, and thought that I thought A Split Paw was used for healing, well then your level is almost on par with your IQ. <P>ParadiseL<BR>1. You'll learn post 40 taunt is pretty useless.<BR>2. When the mob is bashing the tank silly for 120+ with double and triple hits you don't want to wait five minutes for the tank to do a bunch of dmg before the casters start nuking. Your plan may work on the Gnolls in sk but it won't work later in life.<P>OK, perhaps Taunt gets useless over level 30, (as is the consensus of everyone else that has posted) and I have yet to find that out because I am as of yet only level 23. And, what you said is also correct, it’s not smart for a tank to just get hit for five minutes while the casters do nothing. That’s why, if you’re going up against something super bad-assed, you have MORE THAN ONE tank, and healers to keep them alive. The point I was trying to make is to have the casters wait until some damage has been done, they won’t get aggroed as bad as if they had started nuking the mob from the beginning. This strategy works, at least for me. I can stand up to a red con, with a cleric behind me giving heals. Once the thing is down halfway, they nuke the hell out of it and BAM! it is dead. I don’t see why it wouldn’t work proportionally at higher levels. I don’t have personal experience with tanking in a high level situation as this, as my warrior is still a lowly level, and hasn’t gone up against any dragons. Maybe I’m wrong… I admit that. <BR> However, I have never hunted Gnolls in South Karana! Just FYI, the A Split Paw that I had was given to me by a friend to help me see in the dark while grouping to kill sarnaks in Ill Omen. Please don’t make ignorant assumptions. C’mon down! There’s beasties down here that can gank you, even at your illustrious level. <P>ParadiseL<BR>Heh um ok I love it when My 26dmg weapon connects for 12dmg (with my str buffed to 180+)<P>Well, when I was a kid we played D&D. If you hit, you had to roll damage. If you had a weapon that did 1D12, and you rolled a 2, well…. You hit for two. By level 47 you should have realized that you are not going to ALWAYS hit for max damage EVERY time. A lot more goes into it than just how much damage your weapon does. It depends on the level and abilities of the mob you’re attacking, your skill using that weapon, among other things. Don’t complain about it, because it happens to everyone!<P>ParadiseL<BR>If the mob continues to do the same dmg as it did before you disarmed it what was the point? You had an extra button to mash?<P>Well, um… gee. I don’t have disarm yet either. I guess I can’t say anything can I? Ok, once again, I’ll admit I could be wrong. If you use disarm against an armed foe, and you succeed, then it should make some kind of difference in the gameplay, and should be fixed if it’s not. But if you get agroed by a dire wolf… well, disarm IS useless. He’s not using any weapons! So you can use it all you want, and his damage won’t go down. Unless you disarm his teeth, but that could get messy.<P>Ok… before I continue, I must say I have changed my mind.  There do need to be more bind points in the game. A friend convinced me of that after I posted. But, this is something that affects ALL classes, and is not really a class balancing issue. Also, I don’t see why we can’t have safe fall in the late 20’s or early 30’s. <P>ParadiseL<BR>Um we're warriors with BIG bloody weapons and scarred all to hell from past beatings, we should be more intimidating then some tiny rogue with a toothpick or a buff stud in silk using bare fists. (Not bashing rogues or monks in anyway here. Just making a point which of the three gonna scare you more?)<P>You’re right here too. We are BIG and BAD and scary…. Maybe to things that con green. Do really expect to instill fear in a creature that cons red to you? He’d eat you for breakfast if you tried to solo him. Even things that are equal level wouldn’t just turn tail and run. That’s what makes the spell effective. It makes the mob do something it normally WOULDN’T. Something that was below your level might be scared. I do think it would be fun to give warriors the “Battle Cry” just to be able to watch low level mobs flee. However, other than that it is useless. <P>ParadiseL <BR>Didn't see this one get mentioned in the prev. posts. Damn but I would love to have it and i've spent hours trying to legitimize it for my class but still can't even justify it to myself let alone others. PS Druids have the stripped down verison, not rangers.<BR> <BR>(this is talking about tracking as a skill for warriors) Read ‘em again, because it’s there. It looks like we might actually agree on something, I couldn’t legitimize it either. And forgive me if I got the classes mixed up, I forgot that all information posted here had to be EXACT. My bad. <P>ParadiseL<BR>Um ok I take the boat to velious figuring I'll check the scene at the orc fort (sick of camping lguk and solb) I get off the boat and the guardian that spawns UNDER the dock aggros me, I kill him but he's knocked me down to half life i can spend about 30 minutes thumb in but to heal or just head on instead of wasting my playing time for the night healing, so I head on. Get halfway thru iceclad and a direwolf aggros on me now because I couldn't bw past 50% or use an intelligent healing potion/device (best one I've seen did 30hp woohoo not even 1 hit from a med mob<BR>, even funnier were the silk things dropped in kaesora i used one to heal myself once 10hp ...no joke 10 =P) Now I get to waste all this time on cr yay fun another fun night. Oh Wait I can use your idea and bug a cleric/druid/shammy (who are already annoyed to hell by people asking for buffs) if they can please heal me, and if I get lucky enough to find one that is willing to use a wad of his mana on a non group member now i have to go to him for the heal (or be ultra rude and ask him come to me) at which point I get aggro'd again and either train their group or die. Hmmm I think i prefer buying a decent heal potion and using the same as sow potions...in emergencies.<P>This is an argument as to why we should have healing potions? OK, now this is just silly. It’s like saying “Dad Gummit! I’d be alive if that Giant hadn’t killed me!” You get ganked to half your HP’s by some spawn? YES, you sit with thumb in butt until you’re healed. If you only have half life, and you go out trekking where the baddies are just roaming free… well, you’re asking for it. Don’t like doing corpse runs? Then DON’T DIE. One thing I have learned in my 23 levels is that death CAN be avoided. How? Just use common sense. If you’re wounded, sit tight somewhere safe until you are more prepared to travel. As far as how painfully difficult it is to get help, well… folks must turn into complete Aholes over level 40, or they just don’t like you. I’ve never had a problem getting help when I needed it, even from high level players. That’s also where groups and guilds come in. Use good gameplay, grow a little patience and you’ll be fine.  Having a potion is just a cop out. I think Verant agrees, if they didn’t, don’t you’d think we’d have them? <P>ParadiseL<BR>Warriors should have a minimum or 30% more hp then any other class. Our job is to get beat on, the cleric shouldn't have to cast 3-4 Cheals on the tank engaging an even con mob.<P>Who says? That is just your opinion. I respect it; I’d love to have 30% more hit points. But in game I make do with what I have. Wizards are supposed to be the core caster class, right? (May all that is good forgive me if I am mistaken!) Why not give them 30% more mana, too? No wait, that would cause them to do more damage, so then we’d need more damage output to keep up. Why don’t we just give all warriors a “laser” that we can fire from the “death star” and destroy any mob at any time like in Real Genius? That’d be way cool, no?  You have been slain by the_death_star. <BR>(I couldn't figure out how to work in "the alan parson's project, and I was running out of time..hehe.)<P>ParadiseL<BR>"(No, I'm not British.)"<P>Well, I was born and raised in the U.S. I made the comment “no, I’m not British specifically because I had mentioned tea and used the word arse in the previous sentence, and it sounded British. I’m not British, and I wanted to convey to the readers that fact, to the end that they would THINK I was British. But since you’re level 47, and know SOOOO much more then me, I guess you have to be right. Would you like a crumpet?<P>ParadiseL<BR>Umm they have spells?<P>Here’s what I said to spark this: "-More AC. I think the AC for warriors is fine. Just because we are the main tanks, does not mean that we should tower over the rest. Paladins and Rangers can be powerful fighters as well, and we should share the pedestal a bit."<BR>Well, If a paladin or a ranger wants to try to take the place of a warrior in a high level group, let them. See how good they cast when they are getting beat down by the mob and all their spells are interrupted. If we REALLY need more AC, then so be it. What else do we need? Lightsabers? Blasters? A thermal detonator? No, wait … that’s coming in Star Wars: Galaxies. <P>ParadiseL<BR>I'm not flaming you here, just trying to show you where I think you are wrong. You are a lvl 23 war and I am 47 I think I've got a little bit more exp to warrior issues at higher lvls just as the 50+ crowd has even more on me. Think about the fact that you are trying to tell people who have months of playing time on you that they are wrong.<P>Well, I’m not flaming you, either. There’s just something about people with high level characters and that “you can’t tell me anything” attitude that really rubs my rhubarb the wrong way. That’s why I said “Howdy all! I’m not going to start by saying how long I’ve been playing or how many characters I have or how I consider myself to be very smart about all this…. etc, etc, because it’s soooo annoying.” You could be level 60, and not have a smart bone in your body. Or a level 2 and play better than anyone. It’s just the attitude that bothers me. (Gee, I’m sure you all couln’t tell… hehe) I hope I’ve shown that I’m not a complete jerk, because I did change my position on some topics. So, my apologies to Absor and all you warrior readers. I didn’t want to make this a rant or a personal issue with ParadiseL… whether I succeeded or not, well… that’s up in the air. But PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE… don’t start posting messages to me or anyone. If you have an issue with something I’ve said, then quote me and state your opinion. But posts like “you’re a jerk” and “that comment was uncalled for” well, those ruin good strings like this one. Stay on the topic. I’m always open to positive feedback and constructive criticism.

I know this may sound a bit silly but can we give the warrior some small warrior like abilities *I.E. tracking*.

</FONT><HR>As a 53 warrior here are my suggestions for improvement and balancing.<P>1. Taunting -- At my level I cannot taunt worth anything at times. I know I'm not supposed to be able to taunt white conning mobs and higher with my taunting key. This is as intended and not a bug. Which is fine with me because when I hit 60 it will be so worth it.<BR>But on fighting blues such as a level 52 or 51 mob, I have severe problems taunting at times. Using two blood points or two jade maces or Felhammer I still have the same problem. As do most other warriors post 50. Warriors below 50 are fine. It is the post 50 which have all the problems regarding taunting. <P>Solutions for taunting are: Every missed hit counts as phantom damage. Essentially the mobs HP is unaffected, but the hate list goes up as if you have connected with every single hit. This I believe will solve the problem. Maybe a reevaluation of the taunt skill as well.<P>In conclusion to taunting. What good is a warrior if we're not taking damage? Phantom damage would not cause an imbalance since the hp is unaffected. But it would increase hate factor.<P>2. AoE Taunt -- This sounds like a good idea. Something I would like to see if the original taunting problem every gets fixed. It helps to get those mobs on you without worrying about breaking mez to keep the enchanter alive. Especially when there are 10 or so level 51 mobs.<BR>We can hit defensive or evasive and soak up the damage and buy the enchanter time to mez the mobs safely. Teamwork and strategy right here.<P>3. Disciplines -- There are a lot of useful disciplines. Seeing as how I just got my first 10 or 12 second disc not sure. I believe it is called charge. Refresh time is 30 minutes? 22 minutes at 60. I think these short duration disciplines we get 52 - 60 should have a shorter refresh time. Another thing I would like to see with all melee class disciplines is... The ability to use a different discipline right after the one you used is done. Each disc would be on it's own timer so to speak. I really like this idea please consider it. When disciplines were first put in this is how I was hoping it would be. To my dismay when I asked I found out the truth and did not understand until I got to 52 myself.<BR>Angelwind assumes an evasive fighting style.<BR>you lose your concentration to remain in your fighting discipline.<BR>You will be ready to use a new discipline in 11 minutes 03 seconds.<BR>You are ready to use a new discipline now.<P>If each discipline was set on it's own timers things would be more appropriate. Using a 14 second discipline with the refresh of an hour not being able to use anything else is silly.<BR>Please change this. Make it to where each one is on it's own timer.<P><BR>Thank you for reading this post. I hope it gives some insight on what the warrior class needs post 50.<P>Angelwind 53 Champion of Luclin.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here is the rant I dont wanna post again but im gonna vomit... the ability not to be able to use a diffrent discpline while one is charging is OBVIOUSLY broken. The fact that you cant concentrate on an offensive tact because youve winded yourself defensivly is perposterous. Also you must relize that this gives NO reasons to use some of the disciplines as you higher levels must know.

</FONT><HR>Throwing my two cents in...I think bash with shield (maybe hard to do at this point in the game) should have better taunting effect at upper levels.  The balance reason is that by giving up that extra damage(duel wield or 2h), you gain some extra taunting ability.  The fantasy rational is bashing opponents jar them into focusing on onto the person bashing.  One other point...I kind of think this should be added to both Sk's and Palies too.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Warrior is a Very nice class.. much better then the mage I uses to play.(level 60 arch mage/ boring/ defenseless) I enjoy playing warriors but there are a couple things I do like to see Change.. <P>(order of most important IMO)<BR>#1 Taunt Taunt Taunt..<BR>    I'm 58 soon to be 59 and it seems sometimes this button is broken or something. (at least on higher level mobs)  It's usesless trying to taunt a mycoid warrior/sebillis juggernaught.  Point is that when I go deep into seb I take the taunt hotkey offline because it's usesless.  And also it sucks to have some little weiny sk/ranger/monk/pali taunt off you.  Especially using good weapons. ( Scimmy of life steal/club of ice ocean or CSS) low delay weapons that proc decent taunt.<P>#2 Bind wound<BR>   Monks get 200 bind wound pre 50 why don't warriors get 200?  I'm not 60 yet but most people tell me that warriors can bind to 70 percent at 60.<P>#3 Suggestions<BR>   How bout increating dodge and parry skill a bit for warrior?<BR>   Piercing skill max is 240.  Which makes some weapons suck past level 57+ for warriors.<P>Overall I like the Warrior class unlike magacian (rolls eyes).<P>On a side note.. magician is the worst class to play there is post 50.<P>Sort<BR>Ogre Warrior<BR>Leagacy of Sorrow<BR>Luclin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>__________________________________________________Discussion topics and logic and balance applied !!<BR>**************************************************<BR>Taunt- No obvious flaw assuming casters and rouges both that outdamage the taunter by far SHOULD draw more attention. As far as AoE I would like to see it but there is no conceivable way to make everyone attack you in a combat. Perhaps a 60th level ability... MAYBEE !! Ohh any why should monsters care about something not hitting them I.E. phantom damage (you are right guys that woud fix it but doesnt seem right)<BR>**************************************************<BR>HP- Warriors should have fare move HP and a good 10-20 percent as a rough estimate more then a Sk in example and this is CLEARLY not true.<BR>(the way to fix is have warriors depend alot more on sta then any other class)<BR>*************************************************<BR>Combat- Warrios do find dammage nothing to correct there all other combat skill seem fine including disarm which is useless against unarmed opponents... WELL DUH !<BR>**************************************************<BR>Additional skills- There should be a skill for at least 45 and 50 leaving the choic obviously to verant. This is to eliminate boring levels 40-52 when you just gotta think... wow im really gaining krap wihle other classes grow in power still taking into account cap extensions.<BR>*************************************************<BR>Caps- ALl of the caps seem to be find many may argue for bandage or others but I belive that is for self gain.<BR>*************************************************<BR>Disciplines- Besides the OBVIOUS flaws of not being able to use one while another is regening AND the 'double edged sword' disciplines taking just as long to regenerate both making many disciplines obsolete and unwanted they are fine.<BR>*************************************************<BR>Thats all for now...<P>37th level warrior<BR>Damean Bloodroot of Xev<BR>Have a good night all  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Yes, taunt needs an upgrade.  Who didn't say that?<P>An epic quest suggestion, however...<P>All other pure melee types, except warriors get something like 40% haste on their epic weapons.  Warriors also have to give up a main inventory slot for the scabbard of the quest.  Supposedly it's worn on the back of Kargek Redblade...<P>Make the scabbard a haste cloak.  Give it AC, stats, and haste equivalent to other pure melee epic rewards.  This would really improve the reward of the quest and make it more worth while.  Also warriors won't actually be penalized for completing a very difficult quest.<P>Leave the damage/delay, stats, effects untouched on the weapons themselves.  They're fine, really, as long as warriors get the added haste from the scabbard.<P>Later.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I see lots of.. Warriors need this, fix this.  This is about class balance and what could be done to warriors to balance them better with the other classes.  Not a we need so and so, upgrade this, this would be cool, yadda yadda yadda<P>I have a lvl 58 Dark elven warrior on TM.<P>Ok, warriors are the main force of every uber raid.  Three things you need warriors/rogues/clerics.  (enchanters, shaman or two, 1 necro, few wizzies) yeah but you need a high ammount of warriors.  it's all about the defensive.  SK/pally/ranger are nothing compared to a warrior with 4.5k hps 1150ac with defensive.  Defensive makes warriors sooo good, it's totally unbalancing.  Ok so to drop the warriors faster in a fight we up the hits! now mobs hitting 800+ great that's like 400-450 dmg on a warrior which is still tolerable but can drop a SK with 4k health in a heartbeat. <P>People are telling me hybrids can tank anything in an uber fight? no way in hell.  Quad hit of 800 will almost drop em in one round!<P>-Proposal - only two solutions I see to this. <P> a) take away defensive.  Warriors will piss and moan about thier only good disc getting taken away and will loose a lot of people.  And you will have to retune high lvl encounters cause they will be unwinnable without warrior defensive. Maybe a lil hp bonus would help soften the blow here like adding on another 2hps per sta at 6 or something similiar.  (I see lots of coding in this heh)<P> b) Or give hybrids a disc almost or equal to defensive.  Maybe a 35% dmg reduce with a 1 hour recycle.. I dunno. (again lots of work but is it less than above?)<P>Defensive is just too over powering...  Pally's and SK's (anyone still play a ranger a lot? hehe) just don't cut it anymore  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">   <P>Dunno, hybrids are supposed to tank almost as good as a warrior.. not half as good  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  my 2 cents.<P>-----------------------------------------------<P>ok just lil warrior mishaps hehe (non class balancing stuff)<P>Epic: Queen, maestro drops really need to be changed  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">  It's horrible that we can outfit ALL our clerics and TWINKs with sprinklers before we get 2 or 3 warriors a blades.  Maestro is a pretty rare drop for a one day spawn that takes a lil minor headache to get going and in action.<P>Armor: Mid lvl cobalt armor drops is just horribly rare.  Stuff like bracer, helmet.. for the difficulty of mobs and how RARE they are.. Yeesh. heh really.  Bad when there are hundreds of rogue helms on server that have ultravision but only a handfull of cobalt with infra heh<P>lots of lil neat ideas with above posts  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  <P>Harkov N`ytShaide<BR>58 Myrmidion <BR>Tarew Marr<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello, I have a 59th barbain warrior, I've been playing him since day one of open if you where wondering about my back ground.<P>The skills of the warrior are kind of limited, we passed hyrbids with their great hunting spells, speical skills, LOH/HT and self buffs for warriors with pure melee and not much esle.<BR>So what does that leave us with? Uhm.....?<BR>A mid level skill and a 60th level skill would be nice. For mid levels(36-50)Weapon area Specialisation would be great, you could even make it just like the spellcasters specialisation. It would give younger warriors something to look foward to as they get through those hell levels and set our meleeing skills apart just enough from hybrids.<P>As for a 60th level skill, dual weilding 2 two handed swords would be great. Make it so that we have to have like 200 str and 200 dex or something to be able to do it and the STA drain would be killer so its not overpowering. <P>Beserking is not realy a usefull thing under 54th level, its just a message to everyone around you that the tank is about to die. Going beserk does have a few nice things to go with it, if you live. If you don't die you'll most likely get healed back up and then go un-beserk. <P>Crital hits are nice, they are mostly by a kick or a bow hit rather than with your main weapon, even then the added battle spam isn't the real hit or real damage. It realy needs to be looked at.<P>HP&AC<BR>When fully buffed or even not buffed hyrbids are just 500-600hp away from haveing the same as a warrior. Heck even most hyrbids have higher ac than tanks! I've heard that everyone has a soft ac cap at 1200, if its true take off the cap for warriors so that we truely could be the "tanks"<BR>This would only effect the 55+ level warriors because it is hard to get ac up that high.<P>Warrior "epic" weapon?<BR>The quest its self is a joke the weapons even worse, I've seen better stoylines in a b rated movie. All of our hard to get items are rare drops off uber mobs in POF, POH, POA, Chardok, and the scales! So if we ask our guild to help us do the quest we aren't assured the quest item because its not allways there. Unlike most quests where you turn items into a person, a thing spawns guild kills it etc.<P>There are no midway quest rewards as in other epic quests, the easyest way to fix this is to make the scalbard a back item with nice stats and make the right click effect bring the swords together or split it apart.<P>The "epic" weapon its self is far from epic, There are many weapons in the world that are easly camped/bought/passed down than this. <BR>Both the two handed and the 1 handed weapons are subpar from the new loot in SOV and old loot in kunark.<P>Two handed weapons are still broke.<BR>I was lucky enough to get an Oggok cleaver(44/60 2hs) a week ago and it isn't as good as it should be. With 255 str 255 dex 190 agi and 1313 ATK I was hiting for mostly 30-200 dmg with a dely of about 30ish(wr&rbb) When I did see a crit that wasn't scored by a slam or kick it was a crit of 90 dmg or 120.<P>Taunting is still broke and underpowerd. Look at it, decode it, fix it please for 50+ players.<P>If we aren't ment to deal as much damage as a rouge or monk tell us, if we aren't ment to tank as aswell as a paladin with LOH DA healing and what esle tell us. Atleast tell us what the "vision" says we are ment to be good at.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, taunting is something warriors could use, but I'd suggest some other abilites too, such as instill doubt. after all, a warrior would best be discribed as a powerful weaponmaster, whom i'd assume would not only be big, but able to put on a display that would make people think twice before attacking him.<P>another thing i would suggest is maybe putting some new ablities like rallycries/battleyells that would increase their ablities not only for themselves, but some that are for a group's benefit as well. would bascially be like casting a small spell. nothing as powerful as a real spell other classes use, but similar to a morale boost (group buff or self only, perhaps increasing atk, or regen +1, or ac increases, as examples). Or perhaps using the spellslots to allow them quick access to their diciplines, using timers on the gems before they can use it again, similar to how divine aura works for clerics. <P>Increasing the hitpoints on a warrior would be a useful idea as well, because other classes can buff themselves to be have as many hitpoints and AC as a warrior does.<P>their bind wound should be increased as well. warriors, i would think, would be injured often enough to know how to bandage their wounds to a point similar to a monk. of course, i'm not exactly sure how a monk would know how to bandage that well, since they are supposed to be able avoid damage, and are able to fall over and play dead to keep from being hurt. but that's something for a different thread.<P>I don't expect everything to be added in, after all, this is an idea section, but i hope that these suggestions will help to give people some ideas to help balance the class, and perhaps make them a more viable class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053093-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053093.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053093-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053093-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053093-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053093-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053093-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053093&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053093&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
