</FONT><HR>Okay, I don't have the time or attention span to read the rest of the posts here, so forgive any duplication.<P>I have played a wizard to a mid level now (35), so I am unaware of a lot of the higher level issues discussed here. <P>Some of the things I find annoying:<P>1.  At 34th level mages get a bolt spell that does MORE damage than my best 34th level DD.  Explain to me what the wizard's class defining ability is again?  The solution is not to nerf mages, but to give wizards higher damage spells at earlier levels (perhaps less mana efficient but allowing a faster dump overall).<P>2.  Ports...at 29th we get our first 3 portals.  None of these drops you anywhere near a city on Antonica.  This might make sense for those tree huggers, but we wizards are a refined bunch.  We like the big city.  Switch either Nek or WC portal to 29th level.  <P>3.  Damage shields.  You say they shouldn't have given them to us in the first place.  Well take them out of the game and stop giving us new ones in expansions for heaven's sake.  Replace it with a new line of spells!  My wiz is the ONLY caster I've played where after 20th level, only being able to memorize 8 spells at a time ISN'T an annoyance.<P>4.  Dimension.  Wizards are severely lacking in dimension.  Every fight is generally the same for me in a normal group.  Sit for the first quarter to half of the fight, stand up, nuke once (maybe twice depending on resists and toughness).  More stuns might help, giving us the option to cycle stun the mob.  Why wizards don't get resistance buffs castable on other players has always defied explanation for me.<P>5.  A side note on the sight spells:  If you give them an avatar to make them work properly, please make it a non-aggro avatar so they will be useful  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  <P>All in all I enjoy my Wiz, but I am beginning to get into that "Hard to find a group" zone.  Wizards really need something that makes them more "group friendly" post 30.  Literally all we have to offer a group right now is damage and evacs, both of which can be had in apparently more attractive packages.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Reading over Allan's post and I'm starting to worry he doesnt understand the issues.  His comments on the cleric thread seem on the mark.<P>Alan, the problem with  wizard's is they are underpowered atm.  We have an entire line of crap spells (sight,vision spells), unusable damage shields, suicidal port locations (CT, SF, WL), line of port spells which are broken (and you say may not be fixed).  The ONLY way to balance the wizard is to increase his power.  Unfortunantly, VI's vision has boxed the designers into a corner- we blast and we port - and we mostly just blast.  To balance wizards (and balance to me is "make them needed in groups")you have to make their blasts better.  Yes, wizards would do more damage. Yes, people might actually say "wizards do a lot of damage, let snag him"  There will STILL be people who prefer druids (for the their versatility) and pet casters (for the additional tank + spells).<P>As it stands right now, wizards are unpowered b/c our damage output pales in comparison to almost every class in Norrath (sure we can do quick damage but thats a risk of certain death).  Because of that, to "balance" the class, you have to make wizards more powerful.  Fixing the sight and step lines are not going to balance us.<P>&lt;sigh&gt; I know you're trying Alan, but maybe you dont understand the extreme limitations of the wizard class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

My heart has never pounded so hard as it did while I was wandering around in KoS Neriak, praying for my invis to hold. "<P>Yeah that was great fun too! Heheh I remember stories of people becoming visible in the moat and looking through the window into the bar and gasping in surprise when they saw me! (I play on a team player vs player server--so I had to worry about guards AND darkie players!) I was really nervous about that rod!<P>And don't get me started on the thrill of the lower guk rod! I'm just glad I'm not KoS to the frogloks! Hehe those darkies were SO mad when they couldn't get the froggies to aggro on me (I was OOR for the darkies in Lower Guk, so they tried to get the frogs to do their dirty work! I just took off my visible gear and told them I was on a corpse run to the hand room! Suckers! Hehe)<P>Anyway er..this is off topic.

</FONT><HR>Just a suggestion here.   I think a good alternative for the mega hitpoints MOBs is to put a spell specifically in for THAT mob and adjust it accordingly.   This could be something that could add to the questing element of EQ and add to something of a back story for certain creatures, bigger encounters.  Such and Such mob is hated by this person so he may have been working on something to defeat the MOB, ie a spell that only works on that MOB effeciently with appropriate damage for THAT mob.  It would create alot of extra spells for you guys to make, but I feel that it could add something to EQ along with addressing the problem.<P>Thx <P><BR>Drin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>At lower levels wizards suffer in comparison to other classes, namely the 1-24 level range.  At level 29 wizards start to come into their own with Inferno Shock, a 250 damage spell when it maxes, however, prior to that they are lacking.  At level 9 enchanters do 48 damage with their dd, wizards do around 30 with their shock, and 51 with their bolt, a 3 damage margin, however, enchanters also receive a pet, which throws these figures out of line.  At level 20 wizards get force shock, an enchanter style dd, which does around 200 damage and stuns, and is to be an upgrade to the 110 damage shock given at level 16.  However, as it's an enchanter style dd, it is highly resisted and not reliable at all, which leads to many wizards are using their level 16 spell until level 24, when they get a 186 damage spell.  If you guys retort by saying that the level 20 dd is in line, in that wizards should for some reason try different lines of dds (bolts and damage/stuns though at higher level their thing is shocks), that still does not explain why our damage would go DOWN at level 24.  A possible solution that has been proposed is to bump many of the dds back one level, allow wizards to start with their level 4 dd, which does 15 damage, rather than their current dd, which does a whopping 7 damage, very close to the initial dd of other classes.  All I'm saying is that it should be a little more evident that wizards are the masters of direct damage.  Another example, level 44, mages get their neat 600 damage shock, as well as uber pets, and wizards get..a 620 damage (when maxed) dd.  20ish damage seperates a wizard from a mage.  Post 50 wizards fall more in line with where they should be IMO, however, at the lower levels they could use a boost.<P>Okiels line - I'm fine with this, both are +10 fire resist, which many people do not realize, and they stack.  That's a free 20 fire (10, if you don't consider the level 4 usable - the level 34 lasts for around 5 minutes I believe, and comes on shoes, if I had my quest boots I would keep it up 24/7).<P>Resist disease line - when you made elemental shielding stack with other fire/cold buffs it was a step in the right direction, it would be nice to see our other resists stack in the same fashion, although that would be a perk more than anything else.<P>One final thing - manaskin.  I don't know why necros get it, as well as feign death, as well as multiple forms of self healing, as well as harm shield, as well as a pet and root.  However, I suppose this isn't the forum to whine about how irrational the necromancer class is.  I would like to see the wizard skin line get a boost so that it isn't the same as the necro version, or perhaps a lessening in the cost as compared to necromancers.  Wizards, more than any other class (I'd venture to say including clerics), go through gems casting their skins, as that and root are their only lines of defense.  Magicians get a cheap gem self regen, why can't the wizard line be a bit more cost affordable?  I suppose the argument to that, which I have read before, is that the shielding line is not meant to be used all the time, but I feel, as a wizard, that that statement is erroneous.  We have no means to heal ourself beyond sitting (2 point regen until level 51), and bandaging, and as such are almost required to keep up skin just so that we don't die as a result of our taunt.  This issue wouldn't be so outstanding if brainbite was more attainable.  In it's current form you need, I believe, an enchanter to charm the mobs so that you can hand things in.  It's akin to the bard quest - Bards cannot forage their own quest coin in Emerald Jungle.  Sure, it encourages cooperation, but only cooperation between charm classes and wizards.  Why not make the mobs non-aggro, so that two people would need to go, one to fend off the mobs while the wizard did his thing, or something like that.  It would still be dangerous, but more doable.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A post that I didn't see mentioned by anyone after its posting that I find to be VERY interesting is as follows:<P>1 - There is a balance issue between wizards and melee types<BR>2 - Melee types effectivness bears directly on the fact that upgrades to equipment make them far more effective.<BR>3 - Wizards effectiveness bears directly on their spells, not on their items. <BR>4 - BALANCE ISSUE - With Kunark and SoV uber items for thugs, spells effectivness has not kept pace with the effectivness which Thugs find themselves. Example, most rogues post 50, can outdamage a wizard. Example #2 - A good warrior in some kicking gear can outdamge a wizard in some uber gear.<P>Resolution - Make items for wizards and other casters directly affect their spells output. <P>Example : Wizards Bracer of Frost<BR>1123 Ice Comet Damage X item modifier (1.02) = 1146 damage<BR>Example : Wizard Robe of Efficency<BR>400 mana Ice Comet X item modifier (.98) = 392 mana<P>I would be guessing that the following kind of modifiers already exist in the game because of specialization. Just use that same infrastructure, so no sweeping changes, to address a key balance issue between casters and melee types.<P>Cheers,<P>Kysar<P>Thanks Kysar for posting this great idea.  I for one would LOVE to see this idea implemented.  Imagine acquiring Gloves of Flame that don't do any spells themselves, but rather make your fire based spells SLIGHTLY more damaging, or efficient.  This would be awesome and wouldn't unbalance ANYTHING....NADA!  It may just give wizards the efficiency and boost of DD/AoE that they want and NEED!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi Absor!<P>Thanks for answering most of my concerns, when I read your answer I found out some things I forgot to mention.<P>Being a lvl 59 wizard i find it ridiculus that my cold based rain spells get resisted about 50% of the time on lvl 45ish mobs in Skyfire, where the mobs have high HR and low CR. It's not worth the cast to use theese spells.<P>Secondly, I'm not sure if Abscond clears aggro but Evacuate certainly does not. Less than a week ago I Evacuated my group in sebilis believing what you have said over and over that the spell would clear aggro. Well, it didn't. It almost killed my whole group and the train it created wiped out a whole other group. So at the moment the spell costs everyone in the group mana, for no reason.<P>Leews Kiinslayer<BR>Level 59 wizard<BR>Cazic-thule server<BR>Expatriate Loreweavers</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, Alan, you're spoiling me. 2 of my biggest complaints you've addressed directly. (6 level limit & research) Here's my responses to your list:<P>Absor wrote:<P>+ Al'Kabor line of spells: <BR>dunno what to do. I've never casted these except once at 35/36 trying to derail a blackburrow train. <P>+ Flaming Sword of Xuzl: <BR>At level 8, a magician gets a pet for 80 mana which will stay more than 1 fight, has over 200 hit points and will root the target. At level 59, wizards have a 700 mana 200 hitpoint pet which DEFINITELY won't last more than 1 fight. Perhaps you could lower the casting cost to 40-60 for the spell?<P>+ Harvest: <BR>No complaints by me, I love the spell. I'm 40, though, so don't know about post-50 life of the spell.<P>+ Rain Spells: <BR>I tried this recently when soloing in OT. At L39, I bonds'ed, Enstilled, Then hit with Lava Storm. 200 mana, first time hit twice for 120 each hit. (only 1 target, mind you). Second time hit once for 120 and broke root, so for 400 mana, I did 360 damage. I threw it to the back of my spell book and resumed Lightning shocking for 380ish for 180 mana. Seemed more efficient.<P>- Okiel’s Radiation and the other one: <BR>If you won't make them better, remove them. They're a joke. 115 mana for a 5 point damage shield??? at L8, magicians get a 5 point shield for 40 mana. Not balanced. fix it or get rid of it.<P>+ Atol's Apectral Shackles: <BR>Cannot speak of this I don't have it yet.<P>? Snare/Enstill: <BR>I like bonds of force a lot. I'd much rather have a single bonds type spell later than enstill. I still use ROOT when parking an over pull. a BIG blast to get it's attention, Tishan's to stun it, Root to sit it for 30 seconds while we deal with #1...<P>+ Invisibility to Undead: <BR>No comment, I like the spell though (if I had it) and would like to keep it. <P>Teleport Spells:<P>+ West Karana: <BR>I understand trying to download a new zone for 300000 people would be difficult, perhaps you could set up an external download a couple weeks ahead? "Go here. ftp..... and download it into EQ directory as NEWWK.ZNE", then have your patch program look for that and just rename it to whatever it really should be.<P>+ Cazil Thule Gate: Mana of you think this is in too dangerous of a location. I'm not sure that there really should be any promise that the place you end up in should be safe. <P>Why? Druids are safe. Why can't wizards be safe? Seekers of knowledge. Bah! Seekers of a good laugh. The guildleaders who sell gate: cazic to every new L24 wizard must choke themselves laughing so hard.<P>Absor: Use this spell when you know you're gonna die, and any destination is better than where you are. But I also see your point.<P>At no point would you have Gate: Cazic mem'd in a situation where you MAY die. (other than gating to Cazic) You either have personal gate or Evac. If you do decide, Gee, this could get hairy & sit & mem a new portal, WHY would you mem this one? They all take the same mem-time, why in the world would you pick this one? <P>+ Fade/shadowstep/yonder: <BR>How about add a "blinking (6 seconds left)" levitate to the spell and vaulting us into the air with it? The monsters ignore Z axis so we wouldn't be getting away THAT way...<P>+ Evacs: <BR>I think we (wizards) are more concerned with Kunark Evacs needing to be cast in kunark dungeons and the location of the SF evac than with taking LD players. <P>+ Evacs and Abscond: <BR>No comment<P>+ Abscond: <BR>Great. don't have it yet, but look forward to it eventually!<P>Items:<BR>- The Plane of Growth robe: <BR>By the time you're in PoG, you should have C2 & Manaskin & Harvest running. You're better off casting lure, sitting & medding than clicking a 30 second cast. Please reconsider.<P>+ Epic Quest: <BR>Difficult is fine. Let us spawn a "Cazic" with nothing other than his skin. Random "Hope I get a skin on a week long spawn" stinks. <P>+ Concussion spell scroll: <BR>No comment. <P>New Spell Ideas:<P>"BLINK (i.e. proc a defensive shadowstep) <BR>Sounds neat. Would hate to see the mana upkeep on it to be "balanced". <P><BR>Thanks for listening, Alan. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Well we could be coming at this from a number of directions (what SHOULD wizards be like from a description of their focus in the game manual, what would be COOL for wizards to be like, or what needs to be done to BALANCE them). Given Absor's starting note I'll opt for the third concentration, though I've plenty of ideas on the first two as well.<P>Ok, in my opinion this is the balance issue with wizards: They have a total devotion to mana for thier abilities. They have no melee, no pet, no neat skills like alchemy. Their mana cannot be used to produce any lasting effects which will affect combat after they run out of mana (I refuse to include the damage shields, they are mostly a joke to me). This causes a problem which I believe is unique to the class where they have a larger period of complete ineffectiveness than any other class while grouping. Wizards are similar to an inverted melee class in many ways, warriors rely on healers for hp, wizards rely on mana regens for mana points. I don't have a problem with that basic concept. However, hp recovery spells are completely effective instantly which allows the melee classes to continue combat without a restorative downtime. I liken harvest to a monk's mend skill, so I have no problem there. The big difference is that mana cannot be reobtained quickly like hp and a lack of mana prevents a wizard from having any effect on the combat. So, in my opinion there are a couple of options:<BR>- Come up with some way that wizards can affect combat while out of mana.<BR>- Come up with some way a wizard can regain mana more quickly (possibly only during a combat situation)<BR>I find it reasonable to believe that, as a class, wizards would have been driven to research ways to conserve or restore their mana supplies, they would have been far more motivated to do so than any other class. So from a game world standpoint I see no problem. For instance, I believe cannibalize makes much more sense as a wizard spell than a shaman spell, I can see wizards viewing mana as supreme and more important than health. However, if the goal is intentionally to make wizards like an inverted melee I can see that won't happen. Looking at the difference between heals and clarity, perhaps instead of giving the wizard the ability to quickly restore his mana, it could be arranged that the spells which other classes get to restore mana would have a bigger effect on wizards than they do on other classes (justifiable for the reason that wizards are so mana-centric that they receive the flow with less lossage than other classes). Although I would be looking more for an increased instant recovery than something like an increased clarity rate. Perhaps cleric spells would heal 75%hp and the wizard would convert 25% of the spell cast on them back into mana? Perhaps wizards could get a spell which, when active on them, reclaimed some of the mana on any friendly spell case at them with the price being a greatly reduced duration or effect? <P>- The other option is for wizards to be given some things which can affect combat after they run out of mana. Perhaps spells which have a lasting effect on combat (longer rain durations? at higher levels only maybe?) Perhaps adding lasting side effect to some of our DD spells (cold spells reduce dex or slow attack or movement speed, fire spells reduce health regen, lightning spells reduce agility or attack etc.) so that when we are done nuking we know we have debuffed the monster a bit for the rest of the combat? Anything along these lines. I assume things like combat oriented pets are right out, so I'm not exploring those kind of options. Also, anything added to the effects of our DD spells would need to stack with other classes debuff spells (and be weaker than them) so that we aren't stepping on any toes.<BR>- If we can't have either of those then that only leaves increased payback for the spells we get to cast before we run dry. On the issue of us being an inverted melee class (ok, you haven't bought into this I realize, but I really like the idea so let me run with it for a bit) we could be given some mana equivalents of warrior things. When we have &lt; 1 bubble of mana we could go into the mage equiv of berserking (increased int, chance for extra dmage when landing a spell) a real "go out with a bang" sort of thing. We could get the equiv of crits with spells (pretty sure this one has already been floating around). To further steal from other places, maybe we could get focus items like magicians do, but geared towards a particular spell line or damage type. Some other options are spells which do a % of total hp in damage (perfect for those insane hp vellious monosters), a chain damage spell (targets one monster, does damage, 6 seconds later targets a monster near the first and damages it, etc.<P>Another thing we can target is wizards donations to the group. Wizards have been intentionally crafted as introverts. Heck, even the evil necromancers have waaaay more group friendly spells that wizards. Almost all our buffs are self only and we don't have any group friendly spells like summon corpse or rez. I would argue that, due to the group-centric nature of ever quest, that represents a balance issue. I would like to see us given some group utility outside of evaccing. IN particular I would like to see some things which other classes (like druids) can't already offer. Here are some ideas off the top of my head:<BR>- Give us a spell which moves the targeted person's money into their bank account. Monks will love us.<BR>- Give us higher level versions of our buffs which we can cast on others and which stack with other buffs, but have a short duration maybe 5 to 10 minutes.<BR>- Give wizards a second bind point and a second gate spell. This lets us make round trips between home and dungeon. Very powerful, but very group friendly, AND completely in line with our purported strengths.<BR>- Give wizards the ability to add damage procs to group mates weapons.<BR>- Give wizards the ability to shadow step others (aggro NPCs and PC on pvp, NOT non-aggro NPCs or regular PCs)<BR>- Give us the ability to rclick any scroll we could scribe and cast the spell of the scroll with no mana cost.<BR>- Give us the ability to "scry" locations. Cast once to set up an effect on you with the loc encoded into it. Cast again to see that loc. Click away the effect and recast to set a new loc.<BR>- Give us the ability to teleport someone to the same place as a selected group mate from anywhere in Norrath. (Bascially I believe that where clerics reduce xp down time, wizards should be given the supreme reduce travel time spells).<BR>- Give us self only gates to all major cities. I don't understand why we have been so limited in our self only travel abilities, this is our only real strength besides damage, we should absolutely excel at it.<P>Also, one final thing. If it is such a wonderful idea to have portals which can get you killed, then give a few to the druids as well, and make sure they are the only ports they get in the general vicinity, so they either use them and risk death, or they walk. Oh, and take away their SoW too. Ok, /rant. Look I really do not like the idea of portals which we can't really use at the levels we get them. We get far too few for that sort of thing. Not only are the danger gates largely un-useable (and unreplaceable, there is no other nearby gate we can choose from), but there are gates like the WK, NK ones which practically overlap. I really think that you guys need to either lighten up and give us more ports OR make the ones we have useable and safe. This danger port thing may make for an interesting concept, but PLEASE try it out on someone else. We don't even get any movement spells like SoW. I think we wizards pay FAR too much in lack of diversity for it to be fair for us to ALSO pay in potential xp loss for using one of our only two strong areas. It would be like giving warriors only 12 or so sets of armor, and making 3 of them kill you some of the time when you put them on. Oh, kill you AND move your corpse someplace dangerous for you to retrieve it. Anyway, I think I've made my point, please fix the ports.<P>Well those are my thoughts, hope they help you guys decide what to do :-)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Ok, another try at this thread.<P>Taunt and damage:  Several people have asked why a significant upgrade in damage would also increase the taunt factor of our spells.  Well guys, if I go bear hunting with a 22 rifle and an AK-47, do you really think that the bear is going care which gun I use.  I mean, it's going to just be an instinctive reaction by the bear to run over and maul me to death.  The only difference that I see is that I might have a slim chance at surviving the encounter with the AK-47.  So my question is why would any spell have a taunt factor greater than ice comet?  Believe me when I say ice comet has enough taunts to go around.<P>Mana and regen ability:  If this was an actual role playing game, wouldn't you see huge massive characters as warriors or strong agile characters as monks or the stealthy ones as rogues?  Those characters that have an innate ability to cast spells would have to choose the type of magic that they would use.  You would choose to be a wizard because you were gifted with incredible mana regen capabilities and a sizeable mana pool to cast those mana hungry spells.<P>SOV Uber mobs and general group utility:  I really believe that we should become more efficient with our mana as we level.  I don't mean that we just keep getting incredible damage, one shot and we are dead spells.    <BR>We need spells that do a small amount of damage but with incredible mana efficiency.  Someone earlier said that we pay the price of being weak and shouldn't we expect -- no deserve -- to be powerful at the end.  Give us a 150dmg spell with a 3 second cast time that only requires 5 mana.  Think about this.  If we were fighting <BR>an uber mob, after about 25 minutes of casting this spell we should have done around 75000 points of damage.  That would probably put us somewhere near the output of melee characters if we were lucky enough to survive.  Put this spell in a different situation.  You know the situation,  that rare event where you are actually invited into a normal dungeon experience group.  With this kind of mana efficiency you would be  productive in the group.  When the bad pull comes, go into mana burn mode without feeling guilty because you know you will only have to med for a minute before you are helping the group again.<P>Soloing:  The reason wizards solo is because no one wants an experience sponge in a group.  Sorry that is the simple truth.  The wizard gate spells only reinforce this because we can find out that we are not needed in more dungeons faster than any other class.<P>Will thing changes for the wizards?  Well we can only dream.  Remember I created a human wizard because I would be the master of damage and level faster.<BR> <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,  just wanted to relate a little story to you about Monday night to show that there IS a grouping problem. I play a level 8 wizard and got in a group with a level 6 rogue and a level 7 druid. We went to a camp with 3 goblin warriors in Butcherblock. We drew them in and all 3 gobs attacked me exclusively. No amount of abuse from the other players would pull the gobs off of me, even the ones that I had done nothing to. In the end, I did 50% damage to 1 gob, The druid killed 1 and the rogue took 1 plus finished mine. I was at 5% life and less than 10 mana remaining. The two others were over 90%, looked at me and said, "Your spells suck" and booted me out of the group.<P>This problem is occuring at all levels of the game and I find it disturbing that both of the other players could do more than 34 damage per hit even though they were lower level. (Druid's pet factored in) Further, their ability to inflict most of this damage cannot be interrupted or resisted. This is CLEARLY a balance issue.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

That way you can give up your bind afinity and still get back to where you get the best prices. If you want to go to a given city, then by all means bind yourself there and Gate.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have a couple thoughts. <P>Adding to our mana pool would a: make us wizards the true masters of damage.  We still have our limits as to the mana pool.  b: No matter what, we will always have that limitation.  <P>Next, if possible make some of our buffs castable and stackable on group members.  Thus, making wizards more group friendly.  As it is, casting manashield on myself already is costly.  Trust me, Im not gonna be casting that 11pp for every battle.  But, it will help in times that matter.  If not the skin line spells then maybe our shields?<P>Just a few ideas.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Quinntum Mosribren; lvl 54 wizard.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>On the teleportation line of spells:<P>If moving the West Karana teleport location would cause a large download (why didn't adding the missing teleport buildings in SoV cause such a download?), I'm sure wizards would happily agree to port into a green field somewhere, and not necessarily on the wizard platform. Just move the location, and worry about making it look nice later.<P>Please, please consider removing the 'Kunark Dungeon Only' restrictions on the Emerald Jungle and Skyfire evac spells. Currently, if we want to take a group to either of these locations (or places nearby like OS or HS), we teleport the entire group to Dreadlands, run to Karnor, and then evac. Very easy but tedious and boring to do on a daily basis.<P>Our level 57 Evacuate spell takes the group to the safe point in the zone. But, as others have stated, it does not clear agro, and thus is primarily used for faster traveling. If its purpose is going to be for travel, then consider moving some of the safe points to better locations within the zone. Example, don't have them next to the wizard portal as they are in Dreadlands, West Karana, and many other zones. If it is an escape spell, consider removing the agro once cast.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok from what you can read there are a lott of problems with our class personally as a 51th wizard i get really icky about the following facts<P>1. We should be master damage = Ok. But in EQ at a higher level the chars should be more equal = OK. But what is the situation, I have many resistance on blue mobs both in Kunark as well as in Velious. I am not talking about kiting a mob but i mean fighting in a group in Sebilis or Karnors. Or Plane of Fear. I would suggest a permament lower of resistance not only on the lure spells but on all spells above level 50. Maby the type of resistance could be level related. So make resistance less from level 40 and each level decrease the resistance.<P>2. We should be specialized in TP'ing. Well the only extra we have is Plane of Air (only 55+ go there) or Plane of Hate... Hmmm not really interesting in conjustion to that the Velious spells have been easy to find for Druids but wizards are still seeking hmmm not really nice not to speak about that dragon in Wakening lands which makes the spell totally useless.<P>3. Someone mentioned here med bonus in groups that would be super. Really good idea. Would give us more blast power while being grouped in Sebilis for instance. Also the fact and please take this seriously the amount of damage we do really sucks in comparision to other classes while our class should be the destroying factor. There should be a solution for this. If we can solve this it would solve the problems that wizards are not so populair in groups. and you always come last in.<P>4. Besides DD spells get resisted (ice comet doing 12dmg in seb and costs me 20%mana) also our root and snares.. Please lower the resist on them.<P>5. I also really like the idea of backstab maby with a damage cap on it. So rogues will always be uber... But because we are always out of mana we sometimes need to melee ;(<P>Ok I dont want to rand too much but this is just what i have experienced in 1 and half year of EQ. My wizzy is still my main and i love being wizard. Its just a shame that Verant has always said that we are so balanced while we are not. Especially our total damage we can do is a laugh in comparison to a necro or mage at the same level. Please take these 12 pages seriosly and finally give us wizards a serious chance.<P>With regards,<P>Yinen Lanis T'Vyl</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hmmm, after reading endless replies to this thread, I have come to the conclusion that I really could careless about balance in the game. I personally have had to solo my way up with my wizard with a hand once in a great while from friends, having had to endure the endless hours of medding after kills and the risk entailed in this proceeder, I personally could careless if I am balanced with the melee folks, or other caster classes, they are useless to me anyway. Give me the god like powers that are attributed to wizards in almost every fantasy that has formed our view of the wizard. When I think of the wizard as portrayed in all most every book, I have ever read, He is a being of inconcievable power, holding armies in sway, fighting godlike creatures to a standstill, I want that image of a wizard, as far as I am concerned, I am not interested in the concerns of the lesser beings that inhabit my realm, if they should want to huddle together for their mutual protection fine, let them. I would like to stand on my mountain peak and watch them do their silly little dances, then go fight a God for rule of his realm. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>WOW ! 9 pages into the 2nd thread - quite a response !<P>Just wanted to toss in my personal peeves.<P>1. Yep - Atol's fizzling is about as pleasant as stepping on a nail (over & over again).<P>2. Tried _every_ which way to justify casting the Flaming Sword of Xuzl - there's just no situation to make it worth the 700m on a disappearing pet that can die sooooo quickly. For a rare L59 spell perhaps it should maybe do something ?<P>3. Mana regen. Tanks need their HPs like Wizards need their mana. However; Tanks can get relatively easily obtainable items to aid them in the regening of their hits (i.e. rubi bp, iksar bp, fungi tunic (holy crap); etc.). As well a handy Cleric can drop a CH on them & presto - back in action.  Wizards (and other caster - excl. enchanters) get... well... bupkis. A Harvest spell useable in downtime that gives back maybe 10% of a bar depending on yer level once every ten minutes or so & that eats a spell slot up. A 10pp costing Manaskin that grants 1 mana / tic - need I say more ?  And if we're _incredibly_ lucky we can nab our "epic" and get what is it? - 2 or 3 mana / tic ? A sad, sad state of affairs.<P>4. Lastly there's Concussion / Brain Bite - dunno if it's been mentioned here before, but for the difficulty of obtaining this spell why - oh - why dies it stop affecting MOBs starting around L45 or so.  Seriously - I've taken it out of my spell lineup as I have not had it land successfully on a MOB higher then 45 in forever. Dangit ! - it's not even hurting the silly MOB, just dropping us down the agro list dependant on the overall DMG we've done - make it nearly irresistable - where's the "unbalancing" in that ? - wasn't the intent of the spell to do just that ?!?<P>Ah well.... hopefully we'll get a few changes. I still play my 60 Wiz the most of my chars, but it's almost an excercise in frustration these days.<P>Fanorn of Tunare &lt;Phoenix Alliance&gt;<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>In all the roleplaying games I have ever played there is always a high level spell that reflects damage. I would like to see a high level (say 58+)self only buff spell that reflects damage that hits the caster. The spell could work like involn shield does for clerics and once cast will have a short duration or like the Warrior dicipline Ripost. If all damage reflected isnt in the "vision", certainly spell damage including DD, Dots, & Proc'ing damage should be. I think the spell should last longet than the involn shields do and I also feel that the caster should be able to cast spells while it is in effect. The duration of this spell should increase slightly with level, unless ofcourse you like the idea but make it a level 60 spell. Regardless I believe this spell to be universally desired.<BR>Mana, we never have enough on big fights, like against the 200+ HP dragons in SoV. Harvest is a great spell but I would like to see the amount of Mana you get back increase dramatically at levels 58+. Instead of linear progression, it would be nice to see some exponential progression after level 56. This would help the issue without over balancing the game.<P>Now onto my spell wish list. I would like to see 2 new spells for wizards:<P>1. Portal Bind: Essentially allows you to creat a bind that you can take a party to.<P>2. Portal: Portal spell that takes your party to the Portal Bind location.<P>Neither of these spell in my limited knowledge of your secret programming stuff seems impossible. Please seriously consider them.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

For instance I cast disintrigrate on a blue con mob and get the message "Your target cannont be banished"  so I ask the cleric in my group to take care of it for us and Poof the mob is gone.  (assuming it's undead of course)  This spell is useless in every high lvl encounter a group would participate in while the Cleric, Necro, Mage, Druid versions all work just fine.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I know that you have gotten a lot of postings about this, and after reading several of the postings, I have a few things to say.<P>You are correct, wizards should not have damage shield, that is a difining role of a mage.<P>Yet as damage shields is a defining role of a mage, wizard nukes should be our defining role.  My friend Lev 37 mage can out damage me in a nuke fight, all be it a bit slower but can out damage me, with out his pet.  I belive that it would not terribly unballance the game if you gave us an over all boost in our damage output.  With out high damage, and good ports(which you state is our secondary defining role) what are we?  Not much. If we cannot out damage the mage class that has the apperant atvantage of a pet, why even have the wizard class???  I personaly love playing my wizard.  As posted above somone suggested DoT's We arent a DoT class, leave that to the shamans and necro's.  I think the single best thing you can do is a damage upgrade on all of our spells, that or lowering the damage of a mage spells, which i understand would piss off the mages, but they have pets that can take and nuke, we have no pet, we just have our Absorb skins, root and an aoe snare to protect us.  So i belive i speak for most wizards out ther, the main thing that needs to be done is increase our damage.  Secondly get rid of the stoopid damage shields.<P>Thank you for your time,<P>Wizaro Darkcomet<BR>37th Wizard, Zev</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Consider it as offensive defense, effective even in dungeon, contrary to Fade.<P>- Please make AoE spells not damaging to groupmates in PvP servers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 10 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;9&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=050989&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=050989&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
