</FONT><HR>--------------------<P>DESCRIPTION: Allow monks to become less dependent on their armor by adding a large bonus for monks that had absolutely no armor on. Perhaps a chart like this:<P>Over 14 lbs: current penalty<BR>10-14 lbs: no bonus, no penalty<BR>8-10 lbs: 25 point AC bonus<BR>5-7 lbs: 50 point AC bonus<BR>0-5 lbs: 100 point AC bonus<BR>or something similar.<P>STATUS: None<P>-----------------<P><BR>I think this will partally fix our class. <P>How many of us bank shiverback/silvermoon armor when we get it. We all know which pieces are good and bank the others.. Example, I got the silvermoon head piece about a week ago.. Was I excited? NO, I was mad cause I had to go bank this item because it was 6 AC vs my Froggy Crown which is 12 AC. Now seeing as the Froggy Crowns weights more than .1 (not exactly sure), this might effect my AC bonus in the new system. <P>Understand that Verant ISNT going to upgrage the AC of any of our planes armor. Therefore, get as close as I can to 5 pounds would be da bomb and I would start wearing that armor I had banked and weighted .1 (which is cresent, shiverback, and silvermoon). This might finally be a way to get rid of the AZURE sleeves I have been wearing for 40+ levels now. I might get to use one of the 2 pair of Shiver Arms I have banked and rotting.<P>Someone mentioned that they would have to take everything off to get this bonus. This is nutz, our planes armor is EXCELLENT for this already and image if you did have it all and then had a nice 100AC bonus.. THAT would rock.. <P>Now if they upgrade our h2h so I dont have to carry weapons?????<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Some concerns about off-hand damage bonus:  If monks get an off-hand damage bonus, you'd only see monks with Epics and Jade Maces running around.  If this goes through the great two-handers and the low-delay weaps will be made somewhat obsolete.<P>What good would my 17/28 staff of shielding be other than to proc it and then place it back in a bag because two 9/18 jade maces would destroy it and one jade mace in damage.  What good is the 38/40 IFS when when maybe even two 7/18 Wu sicks can outdamage it.<P>I like the idea of off-hand damage bonus to increase monk damage, but can you make it delay based to encourage use of the slower off-hand weaps.  Currently speed and dmg/dly ratio are used to determine what main hand weap to use.  Off-hand is mostly just dmg/dly.  For the sake of diversity, and keeping certain weapons like the rare/uber 17/28 Staff of Shielding and 15/25 Adamantite Club viable, make the off-hand dmg bonus apply to weapons of 25 delay and over.  This would make it so those powerful weapons won't be overshadowed by their lower/faster counter parts...9/18 Jade Mace.  A side effect will be that some monks at later lvls will also consider using their 14/28 fists over the 9/18 Jade mace.<P>Also, this would mean epic needs to be changed to a lower delay and more damage...but this could be better as it will do a lot of dmg without placing the monk so high on the mob's hate list...allowing true tanks to tank.<P>As for 2hb...it will require a new bonus or be allowed to tripple attack to keep up with the dmg that off-handers will now be able to do.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, I'd like to clarify something:<P>QUOTE<BR>ITEM: Unhooking Feet and Fists.<P>DESCRIPTION: In order to increase the monk?s combat ability, we could allow fist and kick attacks to be on separate timers, so that they could use kicks and punches independently.<P>This is not exactly what we requested.  Feet and fists are already unhooked.  The request is actually to unhook our foot based special attacks (Round Kick, Flying Kick) from our fist/tail based special attacks (Tiger Claw, Eagle Strike, Dragon Punch/Tail Rake).  This request would allow us double up on our special attacks.  Since my average Flying Kick is a heart stopping 42 points at level 49, this request is one way of upping our damage output.  Another way would be to give Flying Kick a reasonable min - those kicks for 3 really bring the average down.<P>Oh, and please<BR>1) Fix high-level FD, and <BR>2) Give monks better 1HB weapons.  It's hard to be the toe-to-toe melee king when the warriors and rogues in your party have better 1H weapons than you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>4 simple things.<P>1. The stat bonus's of planar/blackpantherskin armor is well below that of other classes (ie rogue)<P>2. The dmg done by a rogue is greater than that of a monk if they use their backstab or poisins and the monk uses his corresponding flying kicks.   I was under the impression that a monk was the master of melee dmg?  With similiar equipment a monk will outdamage a rogue in almost any fight.<P>3. Rogues are given the ability to assisinate.  Our thunderkick is on the same resists rate?   Why is ours tied to a discipline?<P>4. With the incredible difficulty to find decent armor that weighs very very little, why are most 2hblunt wpns 10 pounds?  This seems a bit excessive for 14 pound max limit.  Are these wpns not meant to be used?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1.  Since monks were defined by the vision as being the best damage dealers, then either they need to be given the triple attack ability at level 60 like warriors, or it needs to be taken away from warriors.  There is no reason why warriors should be rewarded for making level 60 by making them better than monks in the area of damage dealing.  It would be like giving monks +100 AC and +1500 hit points at level 60. This essentially would make them as good as warriors in those areas, and equally defeats the purpose of defining the classes separately.<P>2.  All special attacks (fly kick, tiger claw, etc) should have the ability to double attack, just as the rogue is able to double backstab.<P>3.  While shiverback definitely needs improvement, another good idea to incorporate would be to give an overall 10% or more bonus to all stat increases of any planar armor if the person is wearring all pieces available.  Currently, most players wear select pieces of planar armor and bank the rest.  But if there were a bonus to wearring the full suit, it would breath a little life and value in forgotten pieces and avoids the needs to upgrade pieces individually.<P>4.  New weapons to be introduced should include the same procs and ratio progressions as those that keep cropping up on warrior and rogue weapons.  Additionally, ratios for other class weapons should be toned down a bit, or monk weapons increased, as the monk is intended to be the best damage dealers and ratios and delays should reflect this.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Yeah I play a monk too Absor. *grin*<P><BR>Well actually I LOVE the monk class. I am too low a level to comment on most of these issues, only level 13 case your curious, so I only really want to bring up one point.<P><BR>I agree, make Hand to Hand more deadly. That is the whole thing I love 'bout the Monk class. Class defining ability. Our Hand to Hand should be more deadly than weapons as we level.<P>If you are worried about role playing aspects and how that might not make sense. Well let me put it this way. If you train hard enough in martial arts (speaking from a kung fu background here) you can cause internal damage to your opponent far easier with your hands than with blunt weapons. Trust me, that internal damage can be a lot worse. Not saying you can't cause a great deal of harm w/ blunt weapons but the hands can be deadlier.<P>So there ya go. Makes sense for the class and EQ in general and makes sense in real life.<P><BR>Thank you for listening.<P>Chuka<BR>Level 13 Monk<P>and...<P>Shenlung Tianzhu<BR>Level 36 Wizard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, here's the revised FD item.  Keep in mind that it was changed on purpose, so it's not real likely to go back to the way it was…<P>ITEM:  Feign Death.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Does it make sense that Area of Effect spells or Damage over Time spells would break Feign?  It might also be a fair idea to allow a successful feign death to lower the monk on the hate list, even if it’s only by a small fixed amount.  Most monks are of the opinion that a successful feign death should drop them off the hate list (or at least significantly lower their position).  As it is now, many monks use /q while feigned to get off the hate list.  Monks have no other way to adjust themselves on the hate list, short of just backing out of combat.<P>This is a summary handed to me from some players at Monkly Business.  See attached for details:<P>--Fix the “FD root” problem<BR>--Fix the “frenzy” problem that is inherent in Vellious and Kunark<BR>--Fix the “roamer” problem<BR>--Add an “aggro reduction” factor to Feign Death so as to be used to escape death/adjust the hate list (50 pts)<BR>--Add a “failure message” should the FD skill work but the encounter see through the trickery<BR>--Either make Feign Death believable by all MOBs in game, outside of Gods, Dragons, and specific<BR>     encounters, regardless of level<BR>OR<BR>  --Increase the chance that Feign Death is believed by MOBs of levels 50+<P>STATUS:  None<P>I have a very detailed description on Feign Death from the folks at Monkly Business.  I'm lazy, so I'm attaching it to the end of the document rather than rewriting it.<P>Kienster wrote:<P>&gt;"ITEM: Treant Fists. <BR>-- Typo. Should be "Gem [b]E[/b]ncrusted"."&lt;<P>Ooops.  I blame Bill Gates for that.  Word tells me that it is proper both ways.<P>THE_FNORD wrote:<P>&gt;"I honestly can't believe that they have actually been listening to our concerns. Frankly, I'm speachless."&lt;<P>Well, then I guess I've done my job.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Blazyn wrote:<P>&gt;" This is not exactly what we requested. Feet and fists are already unhooked. The request is actually to unhook our foot based special attacks (Round Kick, Flying Kick) from our fist/tail based special attacks (Tiger Claw, Eagle Strike, Dragon Punch/Tail Rake)."&lt;<P>Got it.

</FONT><HR>Absor, I'm curious about one thing - what exactly is the Vision(TM) for monks?  It would help guide our discussions a bit better I think.  Though to a degree, the community itself does seem to have a pretty clear view of the class and it's role (offensive pure tank, sort of on a middleground between warrior and rogue offensively and defensively), and the current consensus is in the present state of balance, we do need a damage boost, armed and more significantly unarmed.  Is this the right area to focus?  Or is your vision different from ours and should we be looking more to reconcile the differences?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well something I think I would like to see is the weight issue being spread out over the entire life of the monk not just the post 50.  The idea our hands do more damage would be nice for those of us who would play our monks as more of a non-weapon fighter.  and having some of those quests looked into...ie the treant fist and Rolc  they seem to be pretty good but the rewards are not that great compared to the amount of real life time envolved with getting them.  And i do understand they no one is supposed to have all items in the game but with very few monk only quest items (compared to other classes) it would seem that we would be able to get these more readly or not have to spend 100s of hours just to get one part.  i have been playing a monk for most of my career in EQ and have been reading others on the extremely long camp times I myself have only gotten the trenat fist with in the last two months.  anywho i understand you are not looking into this but just my 2cp worth.  i honestly hope you will do more for the class over all from 1-60 and not just listen to the post 50 group.  not knockin them at all but i have been looking at most issues and it still seems that they all class talks are weighted toward post 50 and not 1-60 as i feel it should be. agian my opinion only.  <BR>thank you for you time if you did read this post<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>hmm, absor iam very happy that your really looking into this, its good to finnaly see something positive like this happening.<P>now, the ability to hit withour hands, and our feet skills will up the damage, but not to a extreme amount, we need to add something a bit more substantial for monks along the lines of putting out damage, critical hits is a great idea, but theres something that hasnt been touched upon, perhaps dropping the time it takes for our damage disciplines to refresh, perhaps allowing us to do more thunderous kicks in half the time then it is running now, and add on some kind of thunderous hits to our hand skills, i would love to see that</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor-<P>I am not sure exactly what the conditions are that the feign death skill becomes useless, but it is not neccessarily "frenzy" (a player created term). For some reason in a grouping situation where the mob is being attacked by many people FD has no effect whatsoever. This happens regardless of your hp total, damage dealt, whatever, FD simply is entirly ineffective. You can demonstrate this by trying to solo, FD at less than 200 hp, and watch it work every single time. Then go group and have the 2 warriors beating on the mob and taunting and having the mob still beat you sensless while FD without any kind of failure message.<P>Personally I do not like the idea of FD being the monks "evade." It is not very pleasing to me to have to keel over dead every 10 seconds to reduce aggro, I would much rather just have a simple /discipline to make aggro accumulation less severe, say 2/3 or 3/4 the normal aggro for 3 mins with a 10 min recycle timer. Since these problems are mainly 50+ or even 55+ a discipline would be ideal. And the fact that monks have no good utility disciplines besides stone stance is disturbing to say the least. This aggro reduction discipline would aid warriors taunting in smaller exp groups and improve monk survivability in larger encounters at high levels.<P>Mestre, level 54 disciple of the whistling fists</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

So why not give back monks the ability to help with crowd control with a working FD ?<P>Last not least, thanks to Velious, now both classes get less useful for crowed control.

</FONT><HR>Greetings all,<P>    I have read all of the info for the past several weeks.  And I am new to the post hear but getting info from everyone is good.  Now I have a 38 Iksar monk of my own and it is not easy to play him either.  From what I read about Absor's List some of it needs improvment.  Ok<P>   The ideas I like was the Chain Attack, Improving the Offhand attack, More Dmg output on the Hand to Hand, Giveing the dodge,Netted armor in Kunark, riposte, and block higher caps.  Also liked the Knock back, Appearances, Thundar kick/ Flying kickAnd Combat caps. Now the other stuff on the list needs to be reworked.<P>  For starters, bring the old skill is not that bad of an idea but if you brought kick back which only does like 12 HP of dmg and add stun what does that do?  If you think about it everyone creature in the games has stun or bash that goes up to 96 from what I have seen at my lvl.  But like Absor said if the triple attack was added no need to bring back old skill make them to powerful.  But have stun would be nice for an add on flying kick or Dragon punch/Tail Rack.<P>   Second thing is the quest now from what I have seen in Freeport (and yes my Iksar monk is able to go all over Freeport) thaa the human monk are the only ones to have done the Celestial Fist and Robe of Lost Cricles and the Whistling Fist.  The reason is the Iksar has to do over 80 hours of faction for the quest.  Also before Kunark the Human had a good quest robe which was the Robe of Lost Circles, Now when Kunark came out the Robe of Whistling Fist is easier to get by a Human then an Iksar why?  If the Robe of Whistling Fist was a Kunark robe then it should be an Iksar only robe.  <P>    And with the Celestial Fist Epic Quest there should be two way to get it, one for Iksar and the other of Human.  Currently the quest is geared toward humans, and the iksar has to do over 100 hours of faction to get the quest started.  It does not seem far to the iksars if the quest is for the whole class, but is seems more toward humans, why? <P>   The idea of the sash and head band quest going to black is cool, but the iksar Shackle quest are not that cool.  Why?, becuase not many iksar monk wnat to do them when you spend 80 hours on a small quest for only ac of 4.  Right now I have the Shackle of Bronze and Copper, But it was not easy to get to hear.  To get to Shackle of stone was easy but the Rock was to drawn out for only 4 AC, and the Copper was BS.  They said they fixed the spawn for Kwinn the Outlander but it was not fixed.  I have seen post where poeple spend 20 to 80 hours camping him and still did not get it.  I talk to a GM about the Spawn and he basiclly said tuff and sit there (good customer service, huh?).<P>   About the Wt. Restricttion it sucks, I think this is VI way for not making better armor for monk.  Telling us to stay below 14 or we get a AC penalty.  I have done some reserach on the Ac bonus below 14 and I have found that is have more AC then those who have a Wt. of 14 and below.  Ok, another thing is that with a Wt. of 14 we can't carry extra supples are provisions for a long day of levling.  Right now, my Iksar monk has a Wt. of 32 and has enough food and water for 60 days, has about 101 throwing daggers of the day were pulling never stops, and has a lot of Ac to boot. So the Wt. penlty does truely suck.<P>And please put FD the way it was Before the Nerf.<P>Sorry i just would to getsome of the idea i had off my chest piece.<P>Yotian Rootwalla<BR>4th Rung in Cabilis monk guild<BR>Monk of the code<BR>Defender of Humility</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It is not on the list and I agreee it is not really a "balance" subject but..... that would be very very cool nonetheless  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Maybe I am the only one to have mastered my Super Mario Skills...<P>Szlia<BR>45/Steel/Purple/Red/Officer<P>PS: Raster, if you read this post, stop asap and log in the game.

</FONT><HR>I don't think anyone has commented properly on the Block/Dodge/Riposte line, yet. (Sorry if you did, I got bored of reading 'want weapons to be better than rogues' posts)<P>If the skill caps on these 3 alone are raised, it will only suit highlevels.<BR>Fair enough - that's where the action is at anyway, I suppose.<BR>What about giving these extra skills earlier, as oppose to later on in the game? I don't know many 50+ monks, but I know a whole load of 25-45 ones.<BR>I'm not talking about lowering the level of training, just implement bonuses like the same level our offence/defence level caps increase, or something similar. The topend higher levels will get the bonuses in combat anyway, and the mid to upper orders, of which I'm sure there are many more, will get some benefit instead of no benefit.<P>Same goes for new items and weapons. I'd rather anything new be quested rather than dropped, and no 72 hour camps like the treant fists, either. I know people who've completed ROTLC in far less time.<P>Another suggestion which no-one has probably made - mend should recover stamina as well as HPs. It's annoying that we now run out of stamina in prolonged combats with weapons, without the 100+s of warriors.<P>--FistofXev, Carnac<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, I am a 30 Monk.  Mostly, my concerns are that Monks have too few hit points for our AC/dmg ratios.  I.e.  we do not give enough damage or block/dodge enough to make up for how fast our hp counter drops.  Whatever has to be done to fix this is my only concern.  Raise the damage or increase the effectiveness of dodge/block or increase ac or some combination of these, I don't care.  As long as I would have a chance, toe-to-toe with a warrior of my same level, I would be happy.  Hell, having a minute chance of surviving a blue mob would be nice.<P>FD does need a fix.  Maybe a it should clear agro on mobs blue and below instead of a fixed level 32, or some such.  And it should not fail so often.<P>Anyhow, I am supposed to be a master of hand to hand at 30.  I do not feel like it the way things currently are.  I do not really care how it is fixed, just that it is.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>*TREANT FISTS (in detail)*<BR>Ok.. i dont think anyone went into detail on whats really wrong with treant fists so ill go into detail.. <P>There are gloves called Gem Inlaid Gauntlets<BR>stats are AC8 DEX3 STA3 wt1 and the quest (correct me if im wrong) requires getting split paw hides from SK.. which you could /shout for and probably get as many as you'd need in 10 min.<P>Treant fists are AC8 Dex3 HP5 wt 0.7 and require camping a 6 hour spawn in misty thicket, a random (6-30 hour) spawn in gorge and 3 hard to get to creatures in runnyeye, plus a run from freeport to tox and back to freeport.. hardly worth the .3 weight difference<P>the only reason we wear this item is cause of its no-drop status which shows that your not a twink. and the fact that it matches our robe of the lost circle (a robe that is so incredibly ugly that any gloves we get makes us look stupid, except for these)<P>So what people are asking for is something added to the gloves to make them worth the time spent for them.  I know people that wont go do this quest because their gem inlaid gauntlets they got in 10 minutes are just as good.  Personally Id like to see resists on them.. but the younger monks are asking for a sight spell of some sort.. which is useless to me but it would make them a much wanted monk item so its also a good idea.  upped AC would be good for all people that have them.. It would even be neat if you could put a spammable spell on it like shielding or something.. oh well.. just figured id go into detail on why people want these changed<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;With this we don't necessarily have to go out and get that better gear.

</FONT><HR>Ladymbc i am a real monk, level 50, mostly a casual player and i abhor the weight limit. Not because i want to be able to carry money around, but because i want to be able to loot now and again so i too can eventually buy some of the high end gear that as a casual player i don't really have time to camp. Yes i have a tinkers bag and i love it, i can loot some nice items, but for cash looting 40-60pp and i am over weight. I have decent gear, nothing planar yet, and NO haste item, i don't have the time to camp one and it is rare that i get lucky on the rolls for the good drops anyway. I have 5 levels to go before i get the first weight limit bump, and frankly i doubt i'll make it cause they are all hell levels. <P>/bow</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000455-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000455.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000455-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000455-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000455-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum13&number=13&thisthread=000455&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum13&number=13&thisthread=000455&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
