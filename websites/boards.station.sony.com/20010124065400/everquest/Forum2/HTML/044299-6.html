</FONT><HR>Bah.<P>First off, don't you guys know how to mez?  You can, you know.  In Fear, when the chanters are dead, necros save the day.  Oops, wait, I better be quiet, no one's supposed to know that I suppose.<P>Secondly, for all your WHINING about your manadump ratio, you're forgetting the extremely obvious.  EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU has only mentioned clerics as the class you mana dump.  Which is where I know you guys are totally biased and just making your own case sounds as good as possible.<P>Necro mana dumping to a Cleric - saves lives<P>But wait!  The clerics have mana - it's the ENCHANTER running out.<P>Necro mana dumping to an Enchanter - saves lives.<P>Cleric dead!  Enchanter dead!  DRUID/WIZARD OOM! <P>Necro mana dumping to an Evaccer - saves lives.<P>If all you can do is manadump your cleric, and you never think of the other classes in the group, well, frankly, you suck.  And I think that that versatility of being able to dump to ANY class in your group QUICKLY and WHEN IT'S NEEDED, effectively being able to be the "mana battery" that you so disdain for ANY class at ANY moment depending on the -need- (and far more than any other class... sure, over time they can maybe give more mana but you can deliver a good -chunk- of it almost -instantly-).  If you don't see that as being -extremely- valuable to a raid, even at the ratio of 3 to 1, you're insane.<P>"Make it reasonable.  Let the necro dump 500 mana to any non-necro in the group, it costs 600 mana".  ROFL!!!! HAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!  That is the funniest thing I've heard all freaking week.  Buddy, reasonable ain't even in your vocabulary.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alan, you wanted to see my reasoning for saying "this wouldnt work"?  Here it is, in fact, I will repost LordZemus's contribution and respond to it in line by line manner.<P>.........It seems to me you're just crappy necros...<BR>This nonsense of getting yelled at by enchanters for having your pet up? Poor pet control. I assume you have pet attack and pet back off hotkeys, and an assist key?........<P>Poor pet control?  I've almost *never* been allowed to use my pet on any raid.  Either the pathing is really screwed or the pet aggros stuff.   /pet BACK OFF does not work because as soon as you tell the pet to back off, the enchanter has to remez the mob *perfectly* between the pets last attack and the mobs next attack (which will happen maybe one in twenty) or the pet will get hit and reaggro, completely wasting the mez.  We have known about the pet back off command since release, it's not that we just don't know how to use it.<BR> <P><BR>..........And the damage output on the rogue pet and especially the monk pet (not 59 yet, so can't comment there) is a definite addition.........<P>Can't argue with this, tho it is a very *slight* addition.<P>.... Combined with backup mes (yes folks, ST does work, I've done crowd control to the kitchen in Seb and other nasty places), mana transfer,...<P>Screaming terror is resisted 9/10 on anything that has a 9/10 MR.  It is much better when you have an enchanter tash the mob first, but then, if you have an enchanter there you don't need the necros lame ST.  Mana transfer is extremely slow and offers only 1/3rd the cost.<BR> <P><BR> self-healing...<P><BR>Exactly.. self healing would be great wouldn't it?<BR>Too bad that lifetaps are resisted on any raid lvl mob meaning that this doesn't apply.<P>.........And where the hell are you people getting resisted? The only things that resist my taps are uber mobs with AEs... and let's think about why!.......<P>Try out Velious/VP/ALL UBER RAID MOBS.  There is an amazing amount of mobs in velious that resist taps, not just uber mobs either.. however, ALL UBER MOBS are completely resistant to lifetaps.  That means that necros do ZERO DAMAGE.  There might be one out there that I have missed... but as far as I know, ALL RAID LVL MOBS ARE LIFETAP IMMUNE.<BR>And yes, lets think about why...<P><BR>..........Let's say the queen in Chardok. If I could cast and hit deflux on her in between AE waves, I'd never die, and never aggro her. So why bring wizards at all at that point? Bring a couple necros, and have them tap her silly while magician fire pets attack her!.........<P>Not even gonna bother arguing this.  Have you ever even fought the queen?  deflux between attacks my butt.<P><BR>........But let's face it. Yes there is a drawback to our soloing power, and you can't complain of it........<P>What soloing power? Seriously??  There is at least TWO other classes that solo BETTER than we do at HIGH lvls. where are THEIR drawbacks?<P><BR> ......First off, having a necromancer or two on a raid is a good safety net. Do you know anyone else who can fd and res? And yes, your guildmates will be willing to let you sacrifice some secondaries once they notice you're the only one left at wipeouts......<P>I've seen someone "volunteer" an essence emerald once.  I've personally never owned one.  I've never bothered trying to weasel someones hard earned work out of them.  In the rare situation where all the clerics die and can't be returned with COH, then yes, I suppose that the necro rez *may* come in handy, but again, I've never owned an essence emerald and most necros would probably have to sacrifice somebody else that was still alive AT THAT TIME if it was absolutely crucial.<P><BR>.... Cleric or wizard used too much mana? Pump them....<P>Have you checked out the recast on conversion spells combined with how poor a mana return they give?  This spell really isn't good at ALL for any emergency situation.  It would be over 12 seconds before you could twitch someone twice and that's an eternity in battle.<P><BR>..... Enchanter getting pummeled by a mob? ST, turn your pet's taunt back on (you do leave it off for raids, don't you?) and send it....<P>Pet's taunt doesn't work for crap on anything that a cleric couldn't solo.  We've already covered the ST thing.  It will work every so often, especially if the mob has already been tash'd but it's far, far too unreliable and resisted to be used well.<P><BR>..........., or cast anything out of the Heart Flutter line, guaranteed to make the mob want to eat you.  Throw a shadowbound out to save that tank, because Bond of Death and Deflux WILL hit every mob except the last one, despite these asinine complaints.............<P>They won't with increasing frequency, go buy velious.  It used to be just the Uber mobs, not anymore.<P>...... Oh, and your DoTs do hit. Try using the right ones........<P>*some* dots stick to *some* mobs.  *NO* dots stick to the *UBER* mobs.  I think you can get ignite to stick on something sorta uber out there, but I"m not sure.. that's it tho.<BR>Doesn't matter, despite what Alan said, you WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO USE DOTS ON RAIDS.<P><BR>It's yet another thread of complaining on these boards, but sadly, it's my class this time. I've been playing since release, and while I don't know of the beta power of necros, I've seen every "nerf" to come our way... and frankly, I still feel like the most powerful class in the game, and <P>.......cannot bring myself to truly play any twink I start.........<P>You haven't played other characters and yet your completely confident in your assertion that necro is still king of the hill huh?<P><BR>.... I don't have any problems getting groups, and neither should you........<P>I see necros get passed up for melee and the "big 4" time after time after time.  <P>There, I responded to basically everything he said, and while I'm certain that I'm not correct in everything, I'm also certain that I'm not wrong in everything either.<BR>Have a look Al.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Xaros:<P>You may not be completely worthless as Alan pointed out, I mean, hey, what more could a master of the dead want than to twitch a cleric or enchanter at a horrible ratio, cast DMF on whoever feels like it and clean up after the raid is done.

</FONT><HR>Absor said<BR>Not at all. There are other things that a necromancer can do. You all eschew the use of pets on raids, but they work just fine against any creature that doesn't use fear. And there is Dead Man Floating, summoning corpses…<P>LOL Absor you are cracking me up today.<P>Necromancers cannot summon corpses in a lot of zones in SOV and DMF doesn't work in some zones in SOV.&lt;---those don't make me groupable<P>Yes,corpses still goes poof and pets runs wild no matter what you do to make them stop. I even clicked hide one time to get rid of him before he started a train. Guess what??? He didn't commit suicide. I had just enough time to hurry and mem invisible and cast it.

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I post this in hopes you read though this board again though slim the chance is there and thats all i seek.<P>The origional post was in reffrence to upper lvl mobs. By this i think of the new dragons, gods, and other lvl 60+ mobs not the regular zone mobs.<BR>In this arena and only this arena do i find myself haveing a difficult time proving my worth. <P>   As a necromancer from very shortly after the opening of EQ Ive been though the changes and learned my class and then relearned my class after 50+ because as most necros do not realise the class changes. We are not like any other class which becomes more powerful in there fields and only there fields and become true masters of that role that they were made to fill. We change in a group sence from pet class/dmg dealer to healer/emergency mezer and limited cc/mana battery/pet class. There is no other class in the game that has to unlearn 80% of what brought them to 50th and learn a totaly new way to play and most necromancers to this point havent they continue to play like they always have and hateing it for the drawbacks that they see and the potentiel they are blind to.<P>I have no need to tell you how i play you have your necros on staff ask them they made the class what it is i just use all that has been given me to make myself the best grouping necro possible.<P>In reguards to this when we do fight 60+ mobs it is not possible to do what we need to do to continue to play in our new roles and playing our old roles is also limited. Healing i can do for the 2400pts that buffs can give me mana i can do till i am scraping the bottem of my barrel Dots i can do two mabey three of before all dots that will take are on it then i have to wait again but by then if the mob is going to die its dead. <BR>The one problem i have when facing off the 60+ specitaly mobs is i cant drain for 40 to 120 seconds this might not sound like a long time but its actually what will make or break the encounter. Most high lvl creatures have an AE something dmg doleing out hp with out being able to drain at the same time is just commiting sucide so for the first few seconds its doleing otut mana the clerics, dots wont hold till the creatures debuffed either. bad thing is the mana ratio is lets say unpractical for reall use during these encounters though i continue to use it because its all i can do. By the time im able to stick drains and most times i never can even to the death of the beast i can start minor healing you saw the need and the new 44th spell helps. Most necros dont realise how powerful this spell is along with the stacking shadow compact line. But the problem lies is that we cant drain soon enough to make a diffrence because like you know most high lvl mobs dont last long enough for all the debuffs to be placed on it for our drains to even partialy get though.<P>We realise the limitations that were placed on drains were nessary. i my self know it first hand as i was there when 8 of my kind walked in waved at naggy and droped him one min twenty two seconds later with almost no risk and no resists.<BR>But in our new role drains arent ment for dmg there for hps to be given to others and thus we need to be able to drain in the first place.<BR> <BR> I guess all im asking for in the end is mabey the resist lvl should be looked at so we may be useful again in high lvl mob arena. Partial drains are fine but totaly resisting drains till all debuffs are in place then only sticking 30% of the time makes it...difficult to prove our worth. We do understand the restrictions that must be placed on the classes but some seem a bit harsh this i belive is one of them that may need to be glanced at again in just this area.<P>Till then i'll be upsetting my cleric whos been groaning about doing nothing but buff for the last 5 hours in the crypt of sebilis because i mange all the healing, and doing my 1.2k dmg to trank and passing off the three C heals of mana that im able to.<P>A responce would be appericated but like i said at the top all i hope is that you read it.<P>Vapors d'DeathWind<BR>Veeshan<BR>Meloshski@hotmail.com</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The major concern here seems to be that at the 'big' fight you are relegated to a support role, and you don't like that (and that you're not exceedingly efficient at it).  In other parts of a raid, clearing or recovering, a necromancer is as useful as any other class (yes, even clerics)."<P>Ok first off you never mentioned what we have we can do pre raid.  I cant think of anything other than scout with invis.  But other classes have invis and most high dungeon MoBs see through invis anyway.  Second off, recovering corpses.  Granted a very useful skill, but 1)If the raid is successful, they wont need any corpses summoned and 2)If it isnt then there will be to many corpses for the Necro to summon.  I dont know if this is a bug or not, but if there is a whole bunch of corpses in one area, summon corpse doesnt work well, and GMs wont recover corpses when this happens.  I have seen this happen to friends of mine on raids.  Took them several deaths to get their stuff back.  On a side note, why take a necro on a raid when you can just get one to swing by at the end to recover the corpses if needed.  Really Raids arent for exp for loot, so why bring another body to split the loot between.  If they dont add anything to the equation.  <P>Ok so what else do you have?  Not a good mana battery, we arent really needed for corpse ret, what good are we for?  <P>Not asking for much, would just like to see lifetap on the same resist table as lures (they are high taunt anyway, so probably wont be used much).  Also a  mana tap spell at lvl 55, with an accompanying more effective mana transfer spell(at least 60percent of the cost).  This would make us a more efficient battery.  Get rid of the rez spell and replace it with a summon player.  The mana tap would negate the need for instant mana spell.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I joined a guild and when you play with people for around a year you know there next move.. For me they know if im going to assist heal giving the cleric time to heal another first. The chanter knowa im watching for when he or she is getting beat down I'll ST the mob to give them a second to cast. In the long fights a couple pumps of mana to the cleric,chanter or Shammy helps the group.<P>Why must all this change when a mob is uber/epic? how do you guys justify this? I have worked and invested 200 days of play time for this Necro and it comes to the Time i think im going to have so real fun. New expansions bigger Mobs im really going to have fun!! Nope   No fun..<P>What or who did we piss off in the front office to  hand this decision down ? We should be able to play the game the same as we do In any dungeon or zone in the game... You pulling one of the spells that defines this class is just not right..<P>So when i group with that same OS group and we head to Trak all of the things we have done thousands  of times are just not appicable..<P>What a let down i could have the most Uber gear on the server and not being able to cast on an Uber mob and play as i have for 16 months is just plain diapointing.<P>Tell us why you think it should be Different for the uber mobs?<P>Just tell us why it should change..<P>thx<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just as a follow up on the DOT issue...<P>As you should have seen described, most necromancers will be tackled, bound, whipped, drawn-and-quartered, resurrected, killed again and then /guildremoved for using a DOT in the situations being described (in those rare occurances when the DOT might work). <P>At this point, while I can't give you specifics on the how/when/where of what causes a corpse to poof (aside from the Feign Death-related cases mentioned above), I can say I'm pretty sure I've seen it happen. Perhaps code was put in to prevent that from happening to 55+ mobs, but enough people have said it still happens that it would make any raid leery of trying it. <P>And that's really just it...even if it were completely fixed today, the credibility of any necromancer using a DOT on a prime target has long been blown to hell. The problem went on for so long, and seemingly still happens, it's going to be impossible to convince a raid leader to allow DOTs. The bad PR on the issue is far to abundant to wipe out easily at this point, so I think it doubtful that DOTs will be an option for a long time to come (if they are EVER considered an option). </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

So in other words between the two of us, we are actually loosing over a third of the mana between us when the necro acts as a battery.  Or I have to have 3 bubbles in order to give other caster one bubble.  Which maybe will give enough for 1 or 2 casts.

If anyone has seen a high level NPC corpse poof from a DoT in the last three months, please let me know and tell me exactly how and where and when and what. High level mobs shouldn't poof anymore. We've coded it so that it just shouldn't happen. It will happen on rare occasions for lower level stuff, and that's probably not going to change (though we are looking at this whole thing again right now). But the  high-level-raid-boss-monster-type-NPC corpses shouldn't poof at all due to a fix we made months ago. Don't let that stop you from using DoTs.&lt;&lt;<P>So when the gorgon poofed Dec 20 on fennin ro we were all hallucinating? DAMN! I *HATE* when that happens.  Or does this fall in the "lower level stuff" category?  I feel sorry for the Druid who had his Verm Tunic poof with the gorgon.<P>(In responce to LordZemus, Absor wrote:) <BR>&gt;&gt;Some folks don't agree with the idea that a class that is exceptionally powerful at all other portions of the game might have to take a power-hit in this one part of the game. And it's not such a big hit, as there are still several useful things that make a necromancer useful on a raid. Thanks for pointing some of them out.&lt;&lt;<P>What is power? How do you define it?  Is it doing 1715 damage in 7 seconds? Is it healing 4500 hp in 10? Is it quad kiting 4 mobs at the same time? Is it fear kiting mobs three levels above you? Is it summoning a corpse? Is it being able to damage an Über mob? Is it being able to give mana to others -- via a spell?  Is it being able to twist 4 songs? Is it...<P>Which of the above is "powerful" enough to warrent a class not being able to damage a mob?<P>Which of the above is unbalancing?<P>Absor (And Verant) don't seem to grasp that power is relative.  Sure, my necro can solo an old wurm.  So can a bard, enchanter, wizard, druid, magician.  Sure, my necro *CAN* solo to 50, so can several other classes.  Why is mine being penalized so severely PAST 50?<P>Should the end game reflect so heavily on the prior steps?  Is it the same argument that was used against wizards: "BUT YOU CAN ICE COMET!*$!  That's 1200 damage! YOU ROCK!"  Of course, the wizard responce was, "It only takes us 49 levels to get there.  The 48 prior are hell."<P>And so, the necro says, "Sure, I can solo to 50.  I can also sit and twiddle my thumbs while I watch you try and kill your Über mob.

</FONT><HR>Two cases I know specifically of raid-level mobs poofing.  One was due to a DoT, one was not, but they were both related.<P>The NON-DoT related version happened just the other night on E'ci.  There was a raid on Ragefire, for the cleric Epic weapon.  Fight is going well, then about half the raid goes link-dead, including many melee-types.  One of the Link-dead melee-type gets the killing blow on Ragefire.  Poof goes the corpse.<P>The DoT related one is similiar.  A fear raid fighting CT.  Necro uses his high level DoT, then goes Link-dead.  I see "Cazic-Thule dies." (instead of "XXX has slain Cazic-Thule!"), which indicates to me that the DoT killed him.  Poof goes the corpse.<P>I'm assuming the code is something like this:  Mob dies, and sees where the damage came from.  If they can't find where it came from, they assume it was environmental and poofs the corpse.  If they can find it, they see if the damage came from an NPC.  If so, the corpse will poof.  If none of the above conditions are true, a corpse is generated. <P>Link-dead players are considered NPCs.  Thus, if they get the killing blow, the game thinks that an NPC killed the mob, and doesn't generate a corpse.<P>Mob-corpses disappearing still happens, regardless of how often you say it doesn't.  I see detailed descriptions of how to get it to happen, and that it happens, here all the time, and the only response ever received is "It doesn't happen anymore", when most players know it does.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First two things Verant should do to help necros out here:<P>First, Fix the disappearing corpse problem, especially for post-50 (not 55!) mobs.<P>Second, give us another dd spell, a sister to ignite bones, without the skeleton effect.  It doesn't have to do more damage or have different saves, just make it available so we don't get all the tanks yelling at us for using our only dd at level 50 that does more than 350 damage.  Heck, even make it a level 50 spell (kind of an added bonus to the other awesome level 50 spell we get--improved invis to undead)<P>Verant, move these issues to the top of your debug list!

</FONT><HR>Kytrana, <P>I agree with you to a point. Before the expansions came out, necros were the god class.  They were not only more powerful than other classes, but they were *noticably* more powerful.  After Kunark came out tho, and people left Lower guk, necromancers became much MUCH less powerful, mostly in the post 50 game, but also in the pre 50.  The big deal here is that the post 50 game is easily half the game, you have to admit that.  It is also arguably the only Important part of the game.  Necros post 50 are the weakest class out there *easily* for anything worthwhile in the high lvl game.  I won't even argue who can solo skyfire the easiest because it is absolutely irrelevant.  Skyfire is such a minute, boring, lame part of the game I could care less if necros were the best or the worst at it.  I want my character, which I have spent over 2500 hours of my time on now, to be at least in the same ballpark as the other casters.  I don't want to have to "pay" with nearly EVERY aspect of the high level game because way back when, before kunark or 20 nerfs, Lower Guk was the only decent place to hunt and necros ruled it.<P>I'm sorry, but I didn't play this game to not only be a support class, but be a third or fourth RATE support class.  I don't think Verant should change the "role" of a necro, at least not so DRASTICALLY, when so many people have put in soo much time into a character they loved.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I'm glad for Sk's and I think they SHOULD get it, since paladins get rez and what not, but uhhhh, more bad news for the necromancer.  Face it, twitching others is NOT needed.  It's a diversion, nothing more.  Now that a useful class (tho not quite as useful as others) can do the *only* thing that necros had which was useful to groups, we are truly a dead class post 50.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hm, these posts sound a LOT like the druid posts way back when people were finally getting to level 40 or so, and druids were finding out that they were no long massively overpowered, but only a little overpowered.  Druids have been nerfed again and again, but I finally have a high level druid now, and let me tell you, playing a druid is SO much easier than, lets say a paladin or a shaman (both of which I have).<P>Seems to me that like the druids, necros have SUCH an easy time at lower levels and also that you don't really have to be a good player to level necros up to higher levels, that when you get to higher levels, you don't know how to play to maximize your abilities.  If you're an enchanter, for example, and you suck, there's no way you'll make it to 50, whereas it appears that you can be a pretty crappy necro or druid and still make it to 50 easy.<P>I can't see how a class that has mez (wel, OK, stun), feign death, dot, dd, pets, etc., etc. can be complaining.  Why don't you go try playing a pally or a ranger and see what it really means to be useless?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have a 59th Necro, and alot of friends, to be honest the necro is pretty useless on raids, ill explain a bit to what hasnt been said here already.<P>So far we all know that DOT's, Ignite/Chill bones, lifetaps on uber mobs, and pets (ill exaplin) are not worth the group space of taking a necro, you are better off with another "preffered class". Bieng a necro i dont blame them, cause necro's are worthless<P>Pets....<P>Ok the 49 pet was rockin even after the dagger Nerf, and to be honest ya the pets were to powerfull before the dagger nerf, I was happy with it. Then came kunark pets, they dont hit much harder, they have no AC, and they have Half the hitpoints. You mentioned something about you can use a pet without a fear AE, use a necro pet at a Trak raid and watch how fast it crubmles from the AE, or any of the kunark dragons. Im not asking for a harder hitting pet, just some more hitpoints and AC.<P><BR>Undead spells.....<P>The mighty skelletal dragon thats NOT undead.... ya you know him, the dracoliche any reason he is not undead??? also the one mob in the monk epick that is a sarnak skellie hes not undead either.<P>Lifetaps...<P>I got a good and fair solution that would shut alot of people up on this one.... Have lifetaps save like a lure, at 59 with a ton of mana items on i can cast touch of night like 6 times max on a full bar thats about 4200 pts of damage if i go full burn with no resists and spec alter helps out. Im not gonna out nuke any wizard, im gonna save clerics mana healing me and i can do some decent damage. I only think this should happen to the 59 and 60 lifetap though since this is a raid issue.<P><BR>Scent line....<P>Get rid of one of the worthless spells like Quivering veil of Xarn and give us a unresitiable scent like Malo.<P>Track corpse...<P>Has never worked.... Nuff said<P>Epic....<P>Is not epic give me a hand of the reaper and the phenchryst focus im happy and stats arent far off 200 int is not hard to get, and i think there is a total mana cap also. i think im hititng it now.<P>I have a slime blood and eye of innoruuk sitting around the epic is not epic enough to go to POA all those times hoping a cape will drop.<P><BR>DMF.....<P>The lone worthwhile necro buff.... How about a group DMF... like 58th level get rid of the 2 50+ root spells we dont need...<P>What it comes down to Alan is that Necros got beat down with the nerf sticks one to many times. The essence emerald line was nifty but not practical, NO ONE is going to cast the 1000 mana spell or the Lifetap one, ill save my emeralds to res myself if no clerics are around.<P>If you would like to chat personaly alan e-mail me you can look it up im shure i would love to have an intelegent conversation with you about this.<P>Mechalekahi Mekahineyhineyho<BR>59th Gnomish Defiler (ret)<BR>7th Hammer<BR>120 days played</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

In the last three months nobody has even tried to cast a DoT on anything that they think might poof, based on a problem that no longer exists.  Based on a legacy of worry (and rightfully so) that corpses would poof if DoTs were used, nobody has been using them.

Don't try to tell me that your character won't help others because he's a necromancer, but that he wants to be included into a group that's going to destroy some evil monster and is upset because they don't want him…  You'll have to do better than that.
