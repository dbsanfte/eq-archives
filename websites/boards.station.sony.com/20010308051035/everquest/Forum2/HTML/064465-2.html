</FONT><HR>"Furor claims that he's had a huge hand in 95% of all patches in this game since Day 1."<P>Do you honestly believe that?  There's been a ton of patches that have had nothing to do with the mechanics of high level play.  People just forget about those patches because they have a short memory.  I will say that some of the recent changes have definitely revolved around guilds like FoH, but they aren't unique to FoH.  I would put Afterlife in the same league as FoH and also say they are capable of doing anything FoH does (and have proven so).  If FoH is so brilliant, why is it that Afterlife SMOKED them in ToT2.  AL didn't lose a single player in combat against ANY teams including FoH.  THAT shows strategy, fast dynamic thinking, and tight execution.  <P>"I happen to play on Veeshan and know a few of the players in FoH.  They got where they did because they are smart, efficient, and dedicated.  They didn't make all these firsts because of any sort of insider information."<P>Uhh, just because you play on the same server doesn't mean you know jack squat.  How would you know?  Do you honestly think they would run around and tell everyone that a verant employee leaks them information?  I'm not saying they aren't excellent players but that is irrelevant to the question.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>True, If someone has 'insider information' of game mechanics, MOB stats, paithing, etc.. of course they are not gonna come out and blatantly state it. They most likely will, however, suggest to their guild of different tactics, And low and behold, HEY IT WORKS! <P>What may have taken much more time to defeat the MOB/Zone through trial and error has now been accomplished rather quikly.<BR>Someone else in said guild decides to post the tactics used and now all of the EQ community knows how to do it.<P>Now the big boys of Verant see this, have no idea how the 'Uber Guild' managed to defeat said MOB, Clear said Zone, so quikly and assume that the Guild themselves and their Equipment are too powerful. Well they cant very well NERF the Guild, but they can nerf the equipment, with a mindset that this is how they defeated the MOB/Zone.<P>Verant Employees should play on their own server, or be declined to pass level 50 on a live server to keep things like that from happening. Even if it may not be happening, it still would prove to be a safeguard (checks and balances) against it.<P>Just my Opinion..<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>So Verant employees play the game.<BR>So what<P>So FoH may have gotten 'insider' information in the past.<BR>So what<P>The only thing that bothers me is that Verant may be watching the uberguilds a little too closely and are tuning the game to be competitive for these players...forgetting that the average player doesn't measure up to that standard of play. As a result zones that are fine for guilds like FoH are extremely difficult if not impossible for the bulk of the playerbase. Should everyone be able to do everything? No. But neither should a game be tuned so that only 5% or less ever have access to the top end areas. Verant also needs to keep in mind when designing boss mob encounters that their zones only support roughly 50 players at such an event and shouldn't design them to require 100 players to win the encounter. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
