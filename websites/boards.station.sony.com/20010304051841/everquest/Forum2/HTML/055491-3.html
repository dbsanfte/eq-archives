&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I would first like to thank Absor for being willing to sift through all these opinions, rants, and pleas to find something worth taking to Verant. I will attempt to avoid ranting too much.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I myself have not thoroughly read every single post on here, but I have sifted through them and completely read a good number of them. I may or may not repeat someone else's recommendation or suggestion but this is what I feel could be done to make the Paladin class a more balanced partner in the Everquest community.<P>I think the main problem stems from the fact that every class needs to have an identity and a purpose to set them apart a bit. I don't mean that there cannot be any overlap, but a class needs to have a purpose that is primarily theirs. This purpose does not have to be defined by abilities alone, but their abilities should reflect this.<P>In my eyes, and I believe Verants as well, Paladins are the great defenders of the innocent and just. We are not meant to be the greatest damage dealers out there nor are we meant to be wizards in which to blow our opponents to dust. The one area in which the Paladin does become the aggressor and charge forth in holy vigor is when fighting evil. In regards to this we should have abilities, equipment, and quests that shine on this aspect.<P>What is evil though exactly? Currently Verant has pretty much defined the evil that Paladins combat as being undead. While I agree that this is certainly correct at least in part, I would at a minimum extend this list to include our greatest opposition and challenger, the Shadowknight. In truth were I to define it, it would be more like undead as well as any follower to Innoruuk, Cazic-Thule, and Bertox. It could also just be undead, Shadowknights, and clerics of the previously mentioned gods.<P>I think something that lets us be more effective in facing these opponents would be beneficial as well as enhancing roleplay. The following are my recommendations/suggestions:<P>Give Paladins a chance to perform critical/crippling blows against these types of aggressors. Such an ability is obviously very limited in that it only works against these types of opponents and is still limited by our significantly lower damage output than pretty much any other melee/hybrid class other than bards.<P>Give the Paladins a few more unique spells that are not superceded by other classes spells. I am not talking about a large number, but maybe 4 or 5 scattered throughout the Paladin's life. Preferably make them along the lines to fulfill our class's purpose. Perhaps a smite type DD that only affects the above mentioned evils, or maybe a resist fear line that makes the Paladin immune or highly resistant to fears spells for a short duration.<P>Remove the lvl 55 Paladin discipline and put something a little more purposeful in its place. My suggestion would be to give the Paladin a discipline keeping in line with his particular role . My thoughts on this would be something like<BR>Heroic Aura where the Paladin has a large increase in all defense skills and AC and attracts the attention of all mobs within a certain radius to attack him. This does not really increase any damage he is doing to the enemy but gives those around the Paladin a few seconds to breathe and either run, letting the Paladin make his heroic last stand to save others, or gives them a fighting chance to regroup and cast a heal or two. I am REALLY in favor of something like this, as I think that it would add a lot of flavor and fun and let Paladins enjoy their one small moment of glory without unbalancing the game. <P>Give Paladins better and more equipment. This is by far one of the biggest complaints I have with the Paladin class. There are numerous WAR SHD and even RNG weapons out there that are significantly better than what Paladins can use. On the armor side, I am not seeing a significant number of WAR PAL armor that SHD can't use. I can understand Rangers getting better weapons, offense is after all, on of their main attractions. Shadowknights however, everyone keeps referring to as one of the "defensive tanks". Personally I think this is a fallacy. The only reason they are claimed under that umbrella is because they wear plate and can't dual-wield so sometimes use a shield. And yet, when you look at their spells and the weapons they can use, they are FAR more offensively oriented than Paladins. Heck, even their Harm Touch ability is an offensive attack. They are not a "defensive tank". They are a middle of the road tank. They have better defense yet less offense than a Ranger, but have better offense and SHOULD HAVE less defense than the Paladin. The problem is because everyone has thrust them into the role of "defensive tank" there is a serious problem of balance between them and Paladins. The change in the defense caps for the hybrids were fine with the exception that I think the Shadowknights should have had an equal split in upgrades to defense and offense. Give them the same number of points in upgrade but split them and put half in each. Sorry starting to rant so I'll stop that  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Back to the equipment thing, Paladins should have armor much better than Shadowknights can use if we are going to be denied better weapons and yet they are going to be allowed to use them. Also, what about shields? We need more, and we need better, and we should have better ones than the Shadowknights do based on my previous statements of difference between Paladins and Shadowknights.<P>Gods and follower specific items. I like these. What I don't like is that their don't seem to be one for every combination out there at least at this point. I also don't like that some of the best Paladin gear out there is usuable only by one race or religion and on the Shadowknight side, their equivalent item is usuable by all races and religions of Shadowknights(Shield of the Stalwart Seas/Obtenebrate Mithril Guard for examples). I would like to see armor, shields, and weapons that are reflective of our devotion to our particular gods and I would like to see that they do have some differences but I also want it to be fair to everyone. I don't think that just because one Paladin follows Brell or Tunare they get the most awesome sword in existence and in return the other god's Paladins make do with a semi-standard sword from their god. I would also like to see armor and shields with the crests of their god, and perhaps color as well. Like white and gold for Mithaniel Marr and green and silver for Tunare, etc.<P>Anyway, these are my ideas and I appreciate you taking a look at them. I am excited and pleased that Verant is actually taking the time to do something about setting right the few problem areas there are so that we can all enjoy Norrath a little more.<P>Arindall<BR>Humble soldier of Mithaniel Marr<BR>Innoruuk server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>DOH! Judging from the quotes (since it seems Alan got everybody before me, and people who have posted in this new thread), he didn't get to mine before the thread got corrupted. &gt;:| Grrr...<P>Well, Alan, I'd like to apologize in advance if you did read mine and just didn't care about it. I am going to post mine again, just in case he didn't get to see it. After reading over the other posts here, mine really isn't anything tremendously earthshaking, but it's annoying to think that I got on the first page for once and it probably wasn't read. :/ Like I said, sorry if you've read mine already....<P>Ah, the paladin issues thread. I've been waiting for you...<P>I will mention one thing here: I began writing this several weeks ago. A few days ago, I read on EQ Caster’s Realm that several changes to several classes had appeared on the Test server. Since it has been repeatedly stated that nothing on Test is ever final, I am not going to take the reported Test changes into account and modify this list.<P>First, the good:<BR>I was only level 15 when the increased hybrid mana pool was implemented many, many months ago. Seeing 1/5 of my mana bar vanish with every Greater Heal now, I can only imagine how rough paladins, and other hybrids, had it before this went into effect. This was a GREAT change. This was probably the best change ever made for hybrids.<P>I am also glad that we hybrids finally got disciplines with Velious. I was always confused as to why, even though I swung my sword just as much as the warriors, I could not grasp such simple concepts as swinging it four times in a row, or parrying a whole lot for a short time...But more on that later.<P>The Lay Hands improvement was needed, and well received. Prior to this change, our "defining" skill was, after level 40, only a glorified partial heal. I am quite happy now that I can fully heal myself when I have full group buffs up.<P>The removal of the class-based experience penalties: wonderful.<P>Paladin spells are generally pretty good all-around. I have no serious complaints with the current spells, just a suggestion or two where I think they may be lacking.<P>There is one last thing that I'll stick in right here since I don't know where else to put it. In the SK Talk thread, you mentioned something in your summary to the effect of "SKs and paladins are defensive hybrids, with Rangers being the offensive hybrids." Since paladins and SK concerns are similar, I thought I'd mention it. Granted, SKs can wear plate, but really, can they defend themselves for any amount of time in a high-level fight? Does a 75-point lifetap keep them alive for even a combat round longer when monsters frequently hit for 100+? Take a look at all the spells a SK has. Harm Touch, pets, dots...Tell me how many of them are defensive in nature. <P>Here is how the majority of people who I have talked to view hybrid melee abilities:<P>Rangers are a pure offense class, with their offense being melee-based. Their spells are for augmenting the group and helping during downtime.<P>Shadowknights are a pure offense class, with their offense being both spell and melee based. "I'm going to kill you before you do the same to me, just cause I'm mean!"<P>Paladins are primarily a defensive class. All our spells pretty much revolve around allowing us to take a tremendous amount of damage, and helping others doing the same during combat. Heals, buffs, stuns, Lay Hands... All the tools in our arsenal seem designed to help us hang in a fight for as long as possible and deal as much damage and absorb as much as we can over time. We try to accomplish through magic what warriors accomplish through brute strength, higher HP and AC, and better skills.<P>Anyway, I thought I would go ahead and mention that now. In keeping with the defensive tank nature of paladins, I now will submit the areas where paladins could really use improvement.<P>---Melee Skills<P>Having just recently gotten myself to planes/dragon/serious dungeon level, I am starting to truly notice a major discrepancy in my offensive and defensive skills. This is not only in comparison to other classes, but especially in comparison to monsters. I'll get right down to it, since my post is going to be long...<P>Paladin offensive and defensive skills seem geared to a game where 50 is still the level cap. With typical monsters in Kunark, Velious, and other 50+ areas far exceeding the skills of 50th level, we begin to fall much further behind in offense and defense. I have no problems with monks, rogues, and warriors blatantly out damaging me with their specially developed skills. I accept the fact that when I chose to be a paladin, I sacrificed the time I could spend into developing special skills in return for developing my spell casting ability. What I object to, however, is the fact that non-hybrid tanks still blatantly out damage me when they are *not* using their special skills, and I am using every tool at my disposal. The problem gets worse when even yard trash monsters become unstunnable. Robbing paladins of their Stun spells pretty much robs them of their usefulness. Got a cleric? Paladins get out-buffed. Got any other melee class except a SK? Paladins have less AC (never under normal circumstances should rogues, rangers, and monks have more AC! This is ridiculous!), and "it's more efficient if we Complete Heal the warrior!" So, what do we contribute to the fight? Extremely minor melee damage, since we can't even hit the things we're fighting, and *MAYBE* the occassional heal during the downtime afterwards.<P><BR>--Offense<BR>Paladins should get an upgrade to offense in some form or another. We simply are not very effective at hitting monsters in melee combat after level 50. Our offensive skills are too low when compared to a monster's defensive skills. We simply can’t do much damage at all. Obviously, if we can't damage a monster, we can't get it angry enough to attack us. What good is a tank who doesn't tank?<P>-Weapon Skills<BR>If you are hesitant to simply upgrade Offense, perhaps weapon skills could be increased by a fair amount above their current cap. That way, if my understanding of the system is correct, we would at least be able to hit the monsters more, if not for more all-out damage per swing. I would be quite content if I could at least HIT what I am swinging at consistently. It is quite frustrating to be hacking away at the shins of a giant, yet still be inept enough with a weapon that I flat-out miss a target that large as much as I do. It kind of makes me feel bad. I'd like to think that, if I had attacked a huge monster which was standing stationary in front of me and the monster didn't parry, dodge, or riposte, I was at least coordinated enough to still *hit* it.<P>-Bash<BR>A paladin, being one of the only two classes who frequently uses shields after level 20 or so, should be quite adept at bashing things in the head with a large blunt object. I propose two things: <BR>1) Paladins should have a Bash cap equal to warriors. <BR>2) Bash should have its damage upgraded. <BR>One would think that spinning around and slamming a large, dense chunk of solid metal into a monster's head would cause an appreciable amount of damage. The most I have EVER heard of anyone bashing for is eighteen damage though. Bash is the only way a paladin can consistently supplement his damage output. Paladins need every point of extra damage in order to coax monsters to attack them. I do not foresee that increasing the maximum bash damage from eighteen to thirty or so would truly have an unbalancing effect on battles with level 50+ monsters. Since no one except paladins and shadowknights use shields at this point anyway, the total group damage output will not increase by much. It would help increase our low damage output somewhat, and at the same time, bashing for 30 or whatever would at least make paladins *feel* like they might be doing their share of damage in a post-50 battle.<P><BR>--Defense<BR>Paladins are defensive tanks. However, our defense seems, just like offense, still be geared for a level 50 cap in a level 60 cap game. A 50+ monster's offense seems to be able to easily override our best defenses. "Grrrr Bark Bark Grrr Oh I'm sorry, were you wearing armor there? Oops." (insert sickening crunching sound here)<P>-Defense<BR>Our defense skill in general could use an upgrade, perhaps much closer to warrior levels.<P>-Parry<BR>Using a shield and seeing as much combat as we do, one would think that we would be able to anticipate where a blow was going to land and somehow be coordinated enough to deflect it. Our Parry skill should be closer to or equal to warrior-level, especially considering that we *are* typically holding a shield.<BR>I really don’t know how it could be coded, but isn’t there some way our Parry skill could be increased to near-warrior level when we are using a shield? I currently do not notice any difference between using a two-hand weapon and using a one hand/shield combo. I parry almost exactly the same amount in any given fight no matter what my weapons are. It just really seems to me that we should be able to parry more with a shield.<P>-Dodge<BR>This seems to not happen very often, at least to me. Perhaps parry or riposte catches hits before I get a chance to dodge them. The cap seems appropriate though, since we are not quite the same brawny hulks that warriors are, but we are still wearing heavy plate armor that they are wearing. Still, I wouldn't protest a slight upgrade here.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>-Disarm<BR>My disarm skill is capped. I have disarmed exactly two things in at least 72 hours of pure combat: an Orc Pawn and a Greater Kobold. Raise the skill cap so we can disarm fine steel weapons (which seem to triple a monster’s damage output) with some sort of regularity. Do something to make this skill worth clicking. Perhaps, once the button is pressed, it would stay greyed out for ten or fifteen seconds, and any successful attacks during that time might have a chance of disarming the creature? Or perhaps when the monster parries our attack with a weapon? Just do something to make this skill useful…<P><BR>--Disciplines<BR>As I said earlier, I am very happy that paladins finally got disciplines with Velious. I also am pleased that they followed the same "pure melee with a magical bent" that our class follows. However, I have always been puzzled as to why, after swinging our weapons just as many billions of times as the warriors, monks, and rogues, that we cannot figure out how to swing it four times in a row, or how to focus our attention and parry a flurry of blows for a time. In my opinion, paladins should get at least one, possibly two of the regular warrior disciplines, which would leave us with half the disciplines of a non-hybrid melee. Really, how horribly would it unbalance things if paladins could parry everything for ten seconds in one battle every hour? Following are the disciplines which paladins should at least be considered for.<P>-Riposte Discipline<BR>It would be nice to occasionally get a massive burst of attacks. Perhaps then we could even participate in raids against nasty melee fighters such as Venril Sathir, among others...<P>-Parry Discipline<BR>In keeping with our defensive nature, this discipline is only logical. After angering a half-dozen monsters with a well-placed heal or stun, we could use this spell to give us those extra few moments for the heal to arrive before the ensuing flurry of angry blows takes us down.<P>-Dodge Discipline<BR>I am less in favor of having this discipline added, since it would simply be the same thing as the parry discipline. Also, as I stated before, I wouldn't expect paladins, with their lesser strength, to be able to dodge hits while decked out in their Sunday best plate mail.<P>---Spells<P>All in all, I think paladins get the most useful batch of spells compared to other hybrids' spells. For the most part, they are all great. There is slight room for more improvement, though. Our role in a group is to take the damage meant for others and to save others in a pinch, right?<P>--Casting Speed<BR>Some of our more advanced spells are too difficult to cast during combat. Since our Channeling caps at a fairly low point compared to pure casters, our chances to recover from a hit are lower. Our chances to be hit, however, are much higher. Since we cannot specialize, our fizzle rates are also much higher. Perhaps Greater Heal and Superior Heal should be given slightly faster casting times, so that getting in that last-second heal in a pinch isn't as tremendously difficult as it is now. Paladins give up *effectiveness* for *speed*, which sounds like a reasonable opportunity cost to me. Clerics can heal infinite hit points with a single spell, but it takes a fair amount of time to cast. They trade off *speed* for *effectiveness*. I really can't envision how a half-second or even full second casting time decrease on either Greater Heal or Superior Heal would be overpowering. We will still be tremendously limited by our tiny mana pool (in comparison to our parent caster class), our fizzle rate would still be the same, and we still run the high risk of being interrupted by a monster while we are casting or getting beaten down immediately after healing someone. With this slight change, though, we just don't have quite as high a chance of failure...<P>Speaking from personal experience, it is EXTREMELY frustrating when it appears I will get the saving heal in on a group member, only to have the spell fizzle at the last possible moment, or to have a monster suddenly turn and focus on me and interrupt me at the last possible moment. Consequently, after missing the heal, the person usually dies.<P>Also, I have noticed that after level 45, even when I am standing totally still, I frequently have to “regain my concentration and continue casting.” It has happened to me too many days in too many different zones and while using too many different spells for it to be just a bad run of luck with the random number generator. This might just be something that I alone have noticed… Strangely enough, I now fizzle more with my level 30 spells than I did when I had just scribed them at level 30. Take a look at this, would you?<P><BR>--Current Spell Issues<P>-Yaulp 2<BR>The effect on Yaulp 2 seems to wear off as soon as it is castable again. If I remember correctly, Yaulp 1 seemed to last for an extra two or three seconds after the spell gem returned, usually long enough to properly time another cast in between swings. This spell also seems to get interrupted or fizzle on me a lot more than a 15 mana, half-second casting spell should...<P>-Lull and Soothe<BR>About ninety percent of the time, these spells fail and end up only creating trains. Perhaps the instant aggro component upon failure could be toned down, or the resist rate lowered. This is very rarely useful as it currently is.<P>-Flame of Light<BR>No one uses this spell. I don't think a single 50+ paladin on my server even has this spell scribed. This isn't speculation either; I made a list of every single 50+ paladin on my server and I have talked to them all too. Simply put, for 85 mana (a very noticeable amount for paladins) and 2.5 seconds of casting time, this spell isn't worth it. Compared to the hitpoints of monsters by this time, this spell is only a drop in the bucket, especially considering that with a two-handed weapon and a double attack, we can typically do more damage in the same amount of time. We could also throw that mana to a likely much more useful stun. Reducing both the casting time and mana cost by at least half, or increasing the damage by a decent amount is the only way level 50+ paladins might even bother to scribe the spell. We could then use it as a supplemental damage boost when using two-handed weapons.<P>Currently, the only use this spell has is to bewilder newbies by going anon, hanging out an an orc camp, wearing a mismatched assortment of armor, duel wielding some steins, and alternating between nuking orc pawns, healing, and using 2HSers. "What class is he?!"  "I didn't think wizards could use 2HS!1111!" "i heard they added a new class see i told you i was right!" Etc. etc.<P>Oh, and I have heard that the spell also has no sort of effect attached. It's just a casting message and a damage message. That's pretty...boring....<P>-Expulse Undead<BR>Unless I am hunting in Kithicor Woods in night and I need a big spell to pull with, I never have this spell memmed. The four second casting time makes it fairly impossible to cast during combat. Perhaps the casting time could be reduced just slightly?<P><BR>--Proposed New Spells<P>Sometimes, Stun and Taunt just isn't enough. Monsters just get insanely angry at some people some times for apparently no reason, and it is very hard to "convince" them to turn around and swing at you instead. I personally think that warriors should be able to AE Taunt. Assuming that they get that skill, why shouldn’t a paladin be able to accomplish through magic what a warrior can do with brute strength? If paladins are expected to tank as well as warriors, but we cannot survive as much direct combat as they can, ways are needed to alter the combat scenario. Here are some suggestions. I am trying to present the widest range of options and ideas from my fellow paladins here. I am not necessarily suggesting that we get *all* these spells.<P><BR>-Area Effect Stun<BR>In emergencies, when a pull has turned bad, and the casters need just a spare second or two extra to evac or complete heal, paladins are mildly good at stopping one monster with stuns for a short amount of time. *ONE* monster. Clerics have an AE stun called "Stun Command" at 55. Perhaps paladins could have a downgraded version of that spell after 55? You know, "Stun Suggestion" or something, heh. The stun time could be reduced while keeping the mana costs the same and increasing the recast time slightly. The 150 mana cost would certainly be prohibit a paladin from using this spell continuously. Not every group has the luxury of having an enchanter... This would certainly ease their burden, and no 55+ group would turn down an enchanter or cleric on the basis that the paladin has one measly little AE stun for temporary crowd control...<P>-Knockback or Knockback/Stun spell<BR>Again, in those situations where some monster just won't leave somebody alone, a paladin could vent a nice chunk of his mana to forcibly and physically push a monster away from his victim, stunning the monster momentarily and perhaps long enough to get a root cast to hold the critter there. There could also be a minimal direct damage component to the spell, just enough to get the monster angry with the paladin. Again, this would require a sizable amount of mana (100+), so it would have limited application. Also, it would be quite helpful when a monster is trying to flee, and you can just feel that root won't hold and a regular stun won't do the job. Dash out in front and *BAM*, you get an extra fifteen feet and a few precious seconds in which to hopefully save the group.<BR>Basically, it's just another form of very temporary crowd control for those times when enchanters and other crowd control specialists are not a disposable luxury...<P>-AE Root<BR>Paladins get Root at 22. We are forced to cope with what is really a level 9 spell until extremely late in our lives. At level 54, we FINALLY get an upgrade to Root: Enstill. Especially when my group has needed to make a hasty run for their lives, I would have given anything for an AE root. Again, it would be just another minor crowd control utility spell that would help paladins keep their groups alive. An AE version of regular Root would be really nice. <BR>Oh, and speaking of Enstill, as I recall, somebody mentioned in the Wizard (?) thread that Enstill didn’t seem to work any better than Root…I can’t say that I’ve tried it myself, I just thought I’d remind you just in case…<P>-Tremor<BR>Tremor is a level 34 cleric AE DD spell. Since paladins typically get in the thick of combat much more than clerics do, giving paladins this spell at say, level 50, to me, makes sense. Perhaps lowering the casting time from 4 seconds to 3 seconds would be helpful as well, so we could cast it in combat. The only reason I suggested this spell is as an alternative to the AE stun spell above, just for use in those times when extra damage is highly needed, or when paladins could taunt multiple creatures upon themselves and help save the group. Also, this would nicely complement (a slightly upgraded) Flame of Light in helping raise a paladin’s damage output during combat.<P>-Minor Magic Resist Debuff<BR>Since practically all of a paladin's offensive-style spells are magic based, perhaps a cunning paladin somewhere along the way got the bright idea to stroll in an enchanter guild and scribe a basic magic resist debuff spell. I somehow don't see this one happening, but it's a thought. Stuns are the only viable way we can get monsters to attack us a lot of the time. Unfortunately, monsters seem to be highly magic-resistant, which is really too bad since, as I said, practically every single one of our “offensive” spells are magic-based. There are many times when I have been in combat and the enchanter has been too busy with crowd control to debuff whichever target the tanks were fighting. The level 20 enchanter spell Tashani (23 magic resist debuff) seems like a good candidate to me.<P>-Conjuration Spell with a Purpose<BR>Currently paladins have a grand total of three conjuration spells. None of them are useful in any way, unless the paladin is on a corpse recovery alone, in the dark, in the rain, and he needs an emergency weapon and lightsource. Of course, by the time he gets these spells, he would be an easy snack for any monster he encountered while naked...Perhaps paladins could learn how to conjure up a magic/lore/nodrop/norent shield, or a nice shield/weapon combo. The shield could have relatively low AC but decent resists, notably magic, poison, and disease. (After all, those are the things a paladin is familiar with and should know how to counter.) It would also be nice if the shield was of the glowing, see-through type and generally looked really neat. Just a thought...<P>Perhaps, also, a paladin could conjure a nodrop/norent "Shard of Faith" or something similar, putting his faith in his god into tangible form and creating a range slot item with some minor stat boosts, such as some minor + wis and + str.<P>Heck, I’d even be happy with Summon Food and Summon Drink.<P>Honestly, as it is, my conjuration spells stay back in a very dark, very lonely corner of my spell book.... They would love some friends to keep them company and perhaps move them closer to the rest of the spells. Really, they would. Please make my conjuration spells feel loved.<P>-Atone or similar memory-blur style spell<BR>Frankly, paladins have a hard time travelling and exploring things on their own. Without SoW or some form of invis to the living, we have the hardest time of all spell using classes (and of most of the non-casting classes as well) travelling outside of cities. Supposedly, paladins make up with this by having really good faction. However, the one monster in a zone that hates us seems to *always* be red, have a massive aggro range and a bewilderingly fast and powerful attack. “A Scowling_monster00 claws you for…well, a whole lot. Really, it’s so much that you’ll be dead before you finish this sentence. Good bye.” Go ahead, try to explore Kunark or Velious alone as a paladin who doesn't own Journeyman Boots and can't afford a pack full of SoW potions. Maybe a downgraded version of Atone, with a higher resist rate or casting time, could help us out...Just something to keep from training a hundred things upon ourselves as we travel. Green things still hurt, especially in the expansions...<P>I somehow don't see a spell of this type becoming a reality. It would be great, but I don't think I can actually picture it happening. I just personally have wanderlust some days, and feel like taking a break from endless killing sprees so I can explore the fantastic world of Norrath. I don't always have somebody to travel with, and I doubt I'll get Jboots any time soon. Perhaps with some form of mem blur, I can leave the murderous dinosaur/giant/whatever else behind, run out of aggro range before it recovers, and explore some more in peace... I'm sure that there are many others who feel this way as well.<P>You begin to cast a spell.<BR>You say, "You don't need to see my identification."<BR>A_monster00 says: "We don't need to see his identification. Move along. Move along."<P>-Mithaniel Marr Imbue Spell<BR>As with shadowknights of Bertox, it is virtually impossible to find a cleric of Mithaniel Marr instead of Erollisi to imbue diamonds for human cultural smithing. Granted, the costs of human cultural smithing, ESPECIALLY those for Mith Marr and Bertox, are totally outrageous and the items are not worth making, but that is another topic for another day. Just a minor thought here...<P>---Equipment<BR>Melee class fighters are absolutely, with the exception of monks, totally dependent upon their equipment. No matter how you want to debate the wording, when it comes down to it, paladins are a melee class who spends their entire life in melee combat. Let's face it: paladins have a pretty rough time, especially in their early to mid lives, when it comes to equipment. Finding usable items isn't difficult; finding *useful* items is the hard part.<P><BR>--Item Stats in General<BR>Most items with useful stat boosts are crutches in combat. There is an extreme lack of +Wis, +Str, +Sta gear with decent AC in the game. I think that everyone would agree that those three stats are the core stats a paladin needs to succeed. There is a surprisingly much larger number of + STR + Int gear with decent AC than there is of + Wis, + Str or +Sta. I mean, heck, even Valorium Armor has two pieces with +5 Int apiece! Paladin gear seems to be geared majorly towards + Cha (useless in combat), + Int (useless in combat), and + Agi (of seemingly dubious usefulness). Most items that do have +Wis are low or no AC items with +Int and other useless stats as well. What this means is that a paladin is forced to live with roughly the same base Wis and Str for his entire life. AC is critical to our class, since we are expected to tank just as well as a warrior. We are continually forced to choose between surviving a melee or having nice stats but getting our heads taken off when it comes time to fight.<P>Bottom line: we need more gear that supports our primary stats. For example, take a look at Iksar SK quest armor. There is a generous amount of +Str +Int and +Sta, and a pretty decent amount of resists. It is very nice armor for Iksar which supports their primary abilities and serves to make them more effective. Paladins need more items that help support both our melee and casting skills in combat. Frankly, as much as you may claim otherwise, EQ is, at the core, a game about killing monsters. Giving our *best* equipment high numbers in non-combat related stats is just useless.<P><BR>--Weapons<BR>As I said above, our survival hinges upon our combat abilities. Paladins are seriously lacking in any selection of weapons, especially one-handed gear. Before high-end rare drops from Kunark, a paladin basically has one sword at his disposal: Ghoulbane. 15/35 isn't bad at level 30. At 45+, however, once our offensive skills begin to seriously falter, our damage output falls into the toilet. The only other truly good swords drop deep in the jungles of Kunark, rarely and randomly in the planes, or are epic quest rewards that the majority of paladins will never see. Kunark weapons such as the Sword of Mourning and others still sell quite easily on my server for 25k and up. However, to get into a group where the swords drop, typically you have to have weapons and armor equivalent to the ones you are after. It's a nice circular flow that is very difficult to break into.<P>Paladins basically end up with an extremely small cross-section of good weapons at their disposal. Again, in all honesty, I think that every single level 50+ paladin I have seen on my server has been carrying a Sword of the Mourning and a Sarnak Battle Shield. More one-hand weapons with good stats and equally good procs are needed. Our selection of items with useful procs is woefully thin. Some good suggestions for decent procs: long-lasting stuns, AE stuns, debuffs, non-Ykesha high-damage DDs.<P><BR>--Armor<BR>Mostly I am curious as to why most all our Deepwater Armor has spell effects for spells we will never use by the time we can obtain the armor. The only spells which are really useful are Spirit Strength (the legs, which seem to drop less frequently than the rest…perhaps that’s just my server’s bad luck), Symbol of Pinzarn (the gem still costs us a ton, but saves us mana. It also happens to be on the BP, which also seems to be a very rare drop on my server when compared to the rest of the class BPs), Resist Magic, and Stun (useful when paladins are out of mana and need to stun something…but still a spell that we acquired at level 30 and which is highly resisted).<P><BR>--Shields<BR>Our selection of shields is all right…woefully thin in good AC, STR, WIS at once, but not bad. Actually, the selection of shields after 50 is the Sarnak Battle Shield. Would it really be so wrong for one of the two real (in practice) shield-bearing classes to have a really, really nice shield for their class only? <P>Oh, and a friend of mine suggested shields with procs that go off upon a successful bash. It bears looking into, I’d say.<P><BR>--Two Hand Piercing<BR>I like the fact that paladins got a new weapon skill in Velious. However, have you ever tried working a weapon skill up from zero when you must fight level 40+ monsters for exp? It is insanely difficult. In about two hours of continuous combat use, I gained three skill points, putting my 2HP skill at around 25. Also, is it just me, or was this skill added so paladins could use a grand total of two new weapons? The only 2HP weapons that I have heard about are the Messenger of the Queen and some Velium Lance in Dragon Necropolis drop that 99.5% of paladins will never see, especially since it is WAR SK PAL and not paladin only. So, we’re stuck with one weapon, which, for all practical purposes, is equal to a Soulfire.<P>My suggestion would be that paladins should take a cue from the ranked weapon/armor quests which the Iksar have. For a fairly trivial task, a paladin could acquire a very low damage, VERY low delay 2HP weapon. Something along the lines of a 1 dmg 7 delay or faster. Gradually, through more difficult quests, we could keep upgrading out weapon until we work ourselves up to a truly nice 2HP. Perhaps the various stages of the quest could be given out by paladin guilds all across the world, and culminate in Thurgadin?<P>---Quest Factions and Other Miscellaneous Quest Things<BR>Finally, the very last things on my list are quest factions. Frankly, a lot of the faction hits for quests make little or no sense. Also, paladins could really benefit from a really good level 50+ shield quest.<P>-Holy Partisan of Underfoot<BR>The stats on the weapon show it is useable by paladins of all the paladin races. However, unless you are a dwarven paladin of Brell, your faction with Dru Razbind, the quest NPC, can never be high enough to complete the quest. Speaking from personal experience, I, a human paladin of Mith Marr, am apprehensive to him. The ONLY faction groups in the entire game that I am apprehensive to are the Freeport Militia, Faction391 (mermaids, and I know for absolute certain that he isn’t on their faction), and one group of merchants somewhere in the world. I am *fairly* certain that he isn’t a Freeport Militia member or a merchant. Either make Dru Razbind amiable to all paladins, make the weapon dwarf only, or give us some way to raise our faction with him.<P>-Ronium for the Armor of Ro<BR>I can easily understand the Rathe Mountain paladins’ reasons behind their tasks for the Ro Armor molds. However, the quest for ronium makes little sense. You need two bars of enchanted platinum, Sand of Ro, Soil of Underfoot, Mistmoore Granite, and a bar of Melatite to make a bar of Ronium. <BR>Enchanted platinum is fine with me.  Sand giants hate and attack everyone, so it makes sense that we should battle them for the sand. Paladins don’t exactly like vampires, so raiding Mistmoore for the granite makes sense. Soil of Underfoot is obtained by killing fairies for their fairy dust. Um, what did the fairies do to deserve death? Likewise, why should paladins be forced to kill gnome miners in Sol A for melatite? Was I absent from paladin school the day when they explained why gnome miners were on our  “To Kill” list? Why can’t we just subquest these items from the fairies and gnomes? It seems to me that the Soil of Underfoot and Melatite were only added to the quest to make it more difficult and time-consuming, and to add two more races to KOS paladins.<P>-Captain Hazren Quest<BR>After returning Damaged Militia Helms to whoever it is in the cleric guild in Freeport, you are asked to destroy the true organizer, Captain Hazren. At last report, this quest, which is incredibly difficult thanks to the sheer number of guards which must be killed, only resulted in some minor coin, faction, and a regular spell scroll. That hardly sounds worth the risk and pretty much permanent KOS status with the Militia….<P>-Vox and the Fiery Avenger<BR>The Fiery Avenger is the rarest epic quest item out there. The Vox and Nagafen books are the hardest parts of this quest, with Vox's book being the rarest due to the fact that she's an unstunnable level 55 critter with Complete Heal.... The problem is then compounded by the fact that every paladin there "deserves" the Vox book when it finally drops because they all have Naggy's book. It really is no fun staying below level 53 forever just so I can do this quest.<P><BR>-Shield Quests<BR>All paladin shield quests result in decent mid-level shields. There are no truly good shield quests for level 50+ paladins, not counting the Lodizal Shell Shield. Considering that we use shields a lot, having a nice broad selection of shields to use would be…well, nice. (As I said before, the shield of choice for everyone post 50 is the Sarnak Battle Shield…)<P>-Weapon Quests in General<BR>All paladin-only weapon quests are for two-handed weapons. Really, you could solve the lack of good paladin 1HS weapons by adding a really nice 1HS-weapon quest or two (or three) for level 40+. I mean, side from the stuff in the Plane of Air, which requires a major raid party, a lot of luck, and a lot of cash, there isn’t anything out there for “regular” players.<P><BR>IN CONCLUSION:<BR>Hopefully your brain didn’t implode at any point during this extremely long post. I’m sorry for making it this long (and I hope that there’s no text limit per post on this message board, heh), but I hopefully have addressed all the relevant paladin concerns out there in a well-thought-out and fair manner. As I said, I'm really, really sorry if you did read mine before and just didn't care...I just wanted to make sure that I was heard. Thank you for your time and patience....and generous upgrades, heh. (Hey I can be optimistic, right?)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor in the past when paladins have been reviewed for class enhancements all other classes have complained namely the clerics and warriors.  Verant has stated over and over again concerning nerfs and such that they can't necessarily fix everything to make everyone happy but they can make implaments to try and make a way around the issue at hand.  So far our class has suffered since kunark came out and other classes have far exceeded us to the point we are useless.<P>Someone stated on the other board that pallys look good on paper but in actuality they can't do anything.  We have level 49 cleric buffs etc, but the point is that you can't find a group anywhere in a zone/dungeon without a cleric unless it's newbie land so our spells are useless with exception to occasional heals.<P>It was said when kunark opened (if I remember right) that paladins at level 60 would be equal to a level 50 warrior in offense being able to duel in pure melee and have an even/fair fight (gear and weapons would be a factor).  However there are 2 problems with this.  1 is that although this looked great for paladins warriors recieved far greater enhancements gaining very nice disciplines, kick that stuns, triple attack... The 2nd is that also with kunark the gear and weapons are insanely plentiful.  There are very nice weapons all over the place that all melee classes have EXCEPT paladins and many of them are either easy camps or have a decent drop rate.  <P>What happened is we got enhancements to balance our class but then warriors and clerics and everyone else got better enhancements.  The result of this was actually a nerf because in the long run of those enhancements paladins became useless.<P>Please read and listen to the posts there are many good and needed ideas in here.  But please also don't be scepticle on giving us some enhancements that will greatly improve our class because we need them.  And please this time don't go and give the other classes your trying to balance us with even greater enhancements, then everything would be a waste.<P>Paladins simply put cannot deliver offensively and that is THE main reason we are useless and unwanted.  Our tanking abilities are decent but even those need some improvements but again mainly our offense.  Please either give us better weapons and a bigger variety to choose from since we can't duel weild (pallys and SKs are the only melee that can't duel weild).  There are many 1 handed weapons for duel weilders with great dmg/dly ratios but I can count the number for pallys with 4 fingers.  The dmg/dly ratio of some of these uber 1 handed weapons for duel weilders are better than any of our 1h weapons also.  It has been attempted to get pallys and SKs to use 2 handed weapons more often but there is a lack of great 2 handers out there especially ones that are pally only.<P>If you improve our damage output I guarantee groups and raids will be more inclined to having pallys come along.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Bash skill raised to 252 for paladins and shadowknights (and warriors to keep them happy). Only classes to use shields offensively so should be able to hit highest level npcs with them. Is a max skill raise alone sufficient to re-enable 'chance to stun' on 56+ npcs Absor? Are they really immune or is it simply a case of too low skill caps?<P>What is the pecking order for epic tanking? Think about this alot when setting defensive skill caps, armor AC, and hitpoints. I assume the order is:<P>1) warrior<BR>2) monk<BR>3) rogue<BR>4) pets<BR>5) paladin and shadowknight<BR>6) bard<BR>7) cleric<BR>8) ranger<P>because that is how it is now. Realize that damage mitigation doesn't scale up with epic npc damage output. It takes skill points in damage avoidance to really survive (misses, parries, dodges, ripostes, blocks), because missed quad 800s is MUCH better than landed quad 500s. A paladin or SK cannot be a viable defensive fighter without these skills at the highest levels.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One problem is disarm. technically, this would be a defensive skill-which paladins are supposed to be leaning towards-because you are reducing the dmg they do to you and not doing any additional damage yourself. The current cap is 70 or so. This is rediculous, it hasnt worked me for once and i have used it at least hundreds of times.

</FONT><HR>While I think it's great that finally, almost 2 years after retail, the deficiencies of each class are being reviewed with the possibility of 'fixing' some of the problems, it really speaks poorly of Verant that it has taken THIS long to acknowledge how hugely unbalanced this game is.  Month after month Verant spewed forth about balance issues and now in the face of imminent competition you seek to retain more of your player base.  I really don't know what to say at this point... Instead of fixing the problems inherent in some of the classes, there was a huge drive to put out multiple expansions rather than address issues in the current game.  Motivated by greed, Verant abused their players and I hope that this is not something lightly forgiven by their customers, but of course it will be once EQ2 and SWG come out.  <P>Ranting aside, I really hope that all these items that Absor is adding to his list WILL get serious considersation.  The Paladin class, along with our hybrid brethren, are hugely underpowered, and the expansions have really only done more to emphasize this.  Our damage output is pathetic, even with our so-called 'epic' weapon, and our 'tanking' ability is nothing compared to a warriors.  We are  absolutely no substitute for a warrior.  Why should we be worthless in high-end encounters by virtue of not being a warrior or a rogue?  How many high level paladins kick themselves for not being a warrior, rogue, or monk of the same level?  We've begged for so, so long to be fixed but apparently no one at Verant plays a Paladin or has ANY idea as to what the class is about.  Many good points have been brought up by my fellow paladins already, but here are the issues important to me.<P>Shields... why is our 'epic' weapon two-handed?  It should be one-handed so we can use a shield with it.  How many classes actually get to use shields at the high-end game?  Shadowknights get a very nice one-handed weapon that allows them to use a shield and still maintain a reasonable, if still pathetic compared to a dual-wielding class, damage output.  Paladins get uhm.. well, no one handed weapons on par with even our mildly acceptable 'epic' weapon, which leaves us no choice but to use it if we have it.  A solution?  Give us some worthwhile one handed weapons, just don't put any dual wielding classes on it.<P>Offensive/Defensive Abilities... We can't tank worth a damn compared to a warrior and we're absolutely worthless in the uber-Velious encounters.  Our spells are supposed to make up for this how?  We can't heal for a damn, we've got a grand total of one buff we can potentially use in a group situation.  We can contribute nothing in raid situations other than lag.  We need to be able to do a reasonable imitation of a warrior, period, since our cleric aspect is entirely worthless if a cleric is around.  In small group situations, yes, a Paladin is very useful.. crowd control and interrupting casting being something gives us some utility.  However, Velious is entirely raid-oriented and we just don't cut it worth a damn there.  We should never be taking damage over a warrior and our damage output isn't even worth us being there and we can't interrupt casting since you made so many Velious NPCs uniterruptable save by death.  Yeah, fighting NPCs with uniterruptable cheals is fun!  What the heck are you guys thinking?  This is actually not so much related to offense/defense, but it irks me to no end.  Fix two handed slashing damage so it's on par with someone who is dual wielding, raise our defensive skill caps.. defense alone is not enough.  Bump warriors up in HP to compensate, just let us be decent tanks, too.  <P>Spells...  Except for the fact that our spells are useless in raid/multi-group situations, there's nothing wrong!  I'm sick and tired of our spells being the excuse as to why we're such a pathetic class.  All of our buffs are lower level cleric buffs except for a couple new ones that have been recently introduced and our healing ability isn't even on par with the backup healers.  I really like our spells, but the fact is most of them are useless and since Velious mobs are SO magic resistant, our stuns aren't nearly as useful anymore, along with whole other classes (ie enchanters).  Leave the spells as they are, as there's no way that you can make our spell line any better.  We are deficient in our cleric side, so make it up to us on our melee side.<P><BR>Items... DeepWATER armor is yellow, that makes a lot of sense.  To add insult to injury, we now get a grand total of one spell on our armor that we can't cast.  Warriors and rogues get a spell on each that they don't otherwise have, how nice.  The worst piece though is the breastplate... the effect is so worthless and is just an insult.  Give us major shielding or some other buff, resolution too much to ask?  Hell, I'd rather have valor over symbol of pinzarn.  And to think Shield of Words was put on the Velious BP.  Obviously no one at Verant has any idea about the Paladin class.  Fix the effects on the BPs at LEAST.  Give us weapons!<P>Nerfy Defender... Such a sad history this weapon has.  Doomed to nerf after nerf.  Admittedly in its first incarnation it was unacceptable, but the nerfing never should have continued beyond that.  An unresistable stun is semi-epic, even if a comparable effect lies on an item from yard trash in karnor's.  However, in true Verant Vision(TM), the Fiery Defender went through nerf after nerf and the proc is truly a pathetic thing.  Give us back the second version, an unresistable DD + stun.  And there's NO way that this should not interrupt ANY casting by ANY NPC.  In its current state, I can't interrupt cheals being cast by giants in Kael which is absurd if they have been stunned.  Fix this proc somehow.<P>Those are my primary gripes.  We're pathetic tanks, pathetic clerics... so where exactly are we supposed to fit in in the Vision of Warriors, Rogues, and Clerics being the only vital classes?  Maybe somewhere IF you fix all our problems.  If not, well what kind of thanks is that to someone who has played a Paladin for 2 years?<P>Yukitaro Antslayer, KEG GM, The Rathe<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Don't know if you got to page 8 or not so here is a rehash...  <P>I had this idea after the SK discussion, but I think it would be appropraite for both SK's AND Pallies.  There has been a lot of talk about giving them both dual weild and higher offensive capability.  It seems that the general idea for these was to bo more defensive oriented than a warrior.  So here's the idea.  No dual weild, instead how about double bash.  At say level 25 or so, have the bash skill check the double attack skill (but no be able to raise it), and give the character, with a sheild equipped (this would also apply to weapons that simulate sheilds for bashing purposes), a chance to bash twice in a row, thus giveing two chances to inturrupt casting/stun.  With the idea of a proc'ing shield, this could turn into a nice little offensive boost, without having to give offense and weapon skill upgrades.  I do think though that the bash skill should be upgraded... since Pallies and SK's are more often seen with a sheild at high level than a warrior.  ANd that fits right in with the idea of the "defensive" hybrid... Sheilds are the symbol of defense, and while a bash is an attack, it is still Defensive in nature, that was traditinally used to push back an opponent (knock back component?? hmm), to give the basher more room to adequately defend/attack the opponent.  It would seem then that those two classes would be the "masters" of the defensive attack, and would fit right in with the image.  IMHO this would give the classes another small, yet defining ability that would make them potentially more sought after in higher level groups, where casters can play a pivital role in the party getting wiped out.  Having two chances to stop a spell as it is being cast could be a huge boon to a party.<P>This could be done without having to raise the damage done by bash as well.. even if it only hits for 15 or so points... over the course of a long battle... all the extra damage that can be done is useful.  Combine this with a proc from a sheild (ok I like that idea : )  ) and you add depth to the classes without making them too overly powerful (I mean really how good a proc will a sheild have... stun maybe... or blindness?...etc).<P>Just my thought.... *shrug* seems like it would be a good addition to me, but then again I don't play either class... so I guess I may not be the best judge.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I didn't realize how much lvl 50 was a defining moment for a pally until I reached it.<P>Pre 50 pally - fun, possible find groups, good puller, decent tank, downtime healer, occasional lifesaver, can solo if you spend a -lot- of time getting good equip<P>Post 50 pally - impossible to solo, hard to group, sit at edge of zone auctioning LFG for 45 minutes, then quit and go watch TV<P>I can't even solo a magicians pet of the same level. That is seriously, seriously wrong.<P>Please either make it possible to solo or easy to group.<P>I don't think that subtly raising skill levels is going to do much to change Norrath's view of post-50 pally as a wimpy group addition.<P>We need something that the other classes can point to and say, wow, now it will be good to have a pally in our group. Not even necessary like cleric or enchanter (although that would be nice), just good.<P>When you consider all these changes that people are suggesting (some good some not so good) please remember above all that any changes should be made to make the class fun to play again (this is a game after all) ...

</FONT><HR>Glad to see your getting all this feedback Absor.<P>Isn't this WHOLE discussion relating to Paladin viability in UBER encounters. All that needs done, is a simple fix to make Paladin's more desireable in UBER group encounters. <P>I agree entirely with alot of these suggestions, however - a few super simple additions would solve the problem.<P>Paladins are Defensive Tanks. The why in Gods name dont they have enough AC / HP to stand in and do their job. Raise this, and all is almost fixed. Let them stand in and take damage. Sure Paladins are not going to deal out the damage. Thats not needed. What is needed, is to let them stand there as long as if not longer than a Warrior. The Warrior is doing mass damage, why cant the Paladin take more damage. How can it be balanced if a Warrior DOES more damage, TAKES more damage, has higher skill caps in Offense and Defense, more AC, more HP, more ATK ( and also can now Cast superior spells than the pally with clickable items !! Lol) <BR>Add AC and HP and a higher taunt cap. PROBLEM FIXED.<P>Another scenario that could be done in place of, or along with :<P>A Group LOH !  Done.  Most groups could justify a group spot for this ability.<BR>(And PLEASE fix the LOH on mobs. We all know that someone would NOT intentionally fully heal their Foe)<P>If this seems not quite enough due to Clerics doing the job fine, then :<P>Add a group Mana replenish onto the Group LOH. A 2 for one.  Of course with a long re-use timer. <P>These are very very simple ideas, that groups would love, and would be Pally only.  Fits right into the life saving role.<P>Paladins dont need more Damage output. They either need Massive endurance to damage AND superior Taunting ( at high levels only), or a Skill/Disc. that any UBER group could benefit from.<P>Any of these ideas sure would "not" make a Paladin over powered.... just welcomed in Uber groups.<P>Also agree with all Stun references. This is Paladin territory, and after learning their skills for 50 levels, only to have all that work end with no benefits.... not good.<P>To end my small excerpt , I am kind of confused on some of your "balancing" comments. When such small suggestions receive comments of "unbalance" and "overpowered" - how can you be referring to the Paladin class?<P>99.9% of the Paladins and others reading this absolutely KNOW that Paladins aren't even "close" to being equals in the end game. It's gonna take some changes , and not by the likes of those running in Test right now.<P>IF THIS GAME was designed for all to SOLO, "THEN" these balance issues would matter more for being Hybrid...but its definitely not a SOLO game at high levels. <P>Anyone who says "Paladins can cast spells, therefore, need to be restricted in other areas" is crazy.  Vastly inferior, highly resisted, way too late spells is all they are. They serve NO REAL purpose in group situations, due to ALL groups needing clerics. That equals absolutely NO advantage over any other class after soloing is over. So, make changes that only affect the higher level player.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Fellow Concerned EQ'er.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'll just throw in two more coppers here...<P>Maybe as one of our "innate abilities," paladins above 50 could permanently have crits and crips on undead. Really, as it is, how unbalancing is that? We barely hit level 50+ stuff as it is...<BR>Even with a weapon skill upgrade, how often do crits and crips happen? How often are they worthwhile and actually more than normal damage?<P>Perhaps then, with constant undead crits/crips, the Holy Forge discipline could be slightly modified to be a guaranteed crit/crip for the duration of the discipline?<P>I mean, really, is this too much to ask? We might at least be effective at undead fighting at that point....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>    I know this post is about Paladins but it seems one of the most active ones here and there are some things I would like to express across the board about Tanks in General and then go class by class.<BR>  First of all the idea of Warriors and Rangers being offensive and Paladins and ShadowKnights being defensive, I find to be out of wack.<BR>  I would agree with this idea had they all been on the same side in life working as one nation under one god but this is not so.<BR>  Each tank should be offensive first and deffesive second and they would be that way according to there belife system.<BR>  No tank should excel at all areas but one could do all well.<BR>  The thing here is this, Tanks are specialist and as specialist they should out gun each other in their field of operation and be undergunned out side of there field.<BR>  They very idea of one tank doing all well leaves the others out in the cold, if you think not check out unber raids and see what is wanted and what is settled for.  For the end result is uber raids.<BR>  I am going to go indetail about what I think about each tank and I hope this is food for thought for many.<P>  WARRIORS- This tank is the pure meleeist, there is nothing he cant hurt and do great damage doing it.  He has no special field but can crit/crip damage to anything he can sink his blades into.<BR>  PRO- Can hurt anything and do it well, has extra high magic resist, multi disciplines.  The have the ability to crit/crip mobs.<BR>  CON- He is not a specialist and wont do as well in some fields as some do.<BR>  CHANGES- I for one would add about 2 more disciplins to the tanks and spread them form 20th lvl to 60, give them somthing to really look foword to just like a casters and Hybrids do.<BR>  Warriors dont get mad till you see what I write about disciplins which I think you will like.<P>  PALADINS- This tank is a specialist and a warrior of his faith.  His specialty is evil (undead/demons). This tank should stand out when it comes to fighting along this line of idea, he should be the one you LOOK for when you want to kill undead/demons.<BR>  PRO- He is a specialist, as such he should out do any tank in this field.  He has offensiv and defensive spells in this area that can help a group out and be a back up healer in times of need.<BR>  CON- When out of this field he is still a good tank but takes second place to the warrior but good back up.<BR>  Spell use is a con at times to, you suffer time cast, recast, interrupts and fizzels and Resists which all add up very quick.<BR>  CHANGES- Heh alot would have to be done to make what I said above true.  For one thing, Paladins should ALWAYS have had crits vs undead and about 30% more often, they should be the undead killers for this is there specialty.<BR>  There spells need to be changed heavily.  The should have buffs weaker then they have now but the should be stackable with a clerics buffs.  Why on earth would a faith give you a buff you cant use if a priest is around and kock out most of your spell/defensive abilities and leave you just a weak tank.  They wouldnt but it has been done here.<BR>  Your spells should be week in the buff area but stackable with a clerics, after all you are the WARRIORS of your faith.  You should have spells that are melee in nature that back up your faith.<BR>  Spells like a weak undead damage shield but it stacks with anyone elses damage shield there for giving you a prim edge in this field.  You could have special proc spells that damage or stun undead, there are many things that can be done to make you excel at your specialty, you get the picture.<BR>  I think palys should get like 5 or 6 disciplins.<BR>  I think your Holy aure which should be a great thing for a pally should increase what ever you are doing while it is up.  Raise attack/defensive by 5 or 10, give your spells a anti resist bonus and make crits happen more often like about what it does now in the game, and last about 5 min.<BR>  I think you get the picture of what I am thinking now.<P>  RANGERS-  This is your outdoors man, he knows the woods and animals like the back of his hand.<BR>  He is the one to look for when it come to attacking animals and or giants and maybe a certain creature, up to the powers that be here but I would pick the first 2.<BR>  PRO- Can track any mob, he is a specialist and excels in his field, has spells that are offensive/deffensive that help him do his job.<BR>  CON- Again takes a back seat to a warrior when out of his field but a good back up just like the Paly and SK.<BR>  Spells, same as I wrote for the Paly<BR>  CHANGES- To do again what I wrote above I would give rangers the ability to crit just like the paly but agains animals/plants and giants only and would have about 30% more often.<BR>  Just like the paly he should have weak buffs that are stackable you can make them self only or group, depends weither you want him to stand out on his own or be more group orentated.  Rangers like the palys could have spells that are off/deff vs their chosen field of operations and some general ones.  After reading the Paly you get the idea.<BR>  I think 1 or 2 more diciplins for the ranger might be in order to.<P>  SHADOW KNIGHT-  This tank is the evil verson of the Paly but doesnt have a special area, more or less he is a dirty fighter that looks for week points in his foe and exploits it to get the job done, fairness is a option observed in others.<BR>  PRO-  He is a tank that use spells and abilities to help do what he needs done.<BR>  CON-  Kos everywhere, and suffers spell penilties just like the Paly and Ranger.<BR>  CHANGES-  I would not give SKs a crit ability in the way others have it, I just dont seem them doing it like warriors do but more of the warrior assasin.<BR>  I would give them the ability to do a deadly strike, stronger then the rogue backstab or warrior crip.  I see this ability going off depending upon dex maybe once per one or 2 mobs depending again on dex and how long a fight last.<BR>  Spells need a huge work up, they are meleeist not necros, all spells should be quick fire, you are in combat, no reason for spells to have a long delay if its made to be used in combat, that doesnt make sense, and again they should be stackable.  Just cause your spells are necro in nature does not mean you got them from a necro, I have tires on my motorcycle but not all motorcycles have the same brand but you can put them all on most bikes.<BR>  I think varent really needs to think here when it comes to spells for the sk and I will take it apart some so you can see what I mean.<BR>  DOTs- SK dots should not be as large as a necros but should be about a 1/3 the size and maybe 2/3 for a uber dot or 2 it really depends on out look.<BR>  Dots need to be made according to the general weapon a SK uses for the lvl he gets the spell.<BR>  Most of the times you have to fire your spells off in combat and there is no reason I would fire a dot that suffers long cast time/resist/interrupt/fizzle/necro is around, if my weapon can do all this in the same amount of time for free.<BR>  Dots for a SK should be quick firing, 1/3 to half the damage of a necro of equal lvl but debuffs either abilites or resists on target there for making the lesser damage with the weekness it will cause in return.<BR>  Sks spells like syphion stength and the spell they should have had like grim aura should progress in lvl to keep them up to standard for the mobs you are fighting.  No they dont need to be made overpoweing, look at vamperic embrace, it still goes up in lvl but it skips 2 or 3 lvls befor it goes up one more point.<BR>  SKs should have spells based off in my oppinion poison, disease, and magic.<BR>  SKs as well as other hybrids should have spells that cross over but also spell lines that are their own so that they are useable even if a necro is around.<BR>  Spells should be created like the dots I mentioned above and spells like banshee arua should be stackable, it gives the sk a reason to use it even if a mage or druid is around instead of having another useless spell for the lvl you got it in your book.<BR>  I See SKs still crying that HT should be stronger, well why?  Its use once a day, dont let this be a class defining feature, it doesnt help that much, the only thing I can think to make it more usefull is to make it do a partial life tap, about half the damage you do goes back to the SK, but other wise just forget about HT.<BR>  I see Unholy aure working just like the Paladine Holy Aura.  I would have it last 5 min or so and just up what ever it is you are doing, anti spell resist, add to off/deff, deadly stike happens more often and your own resist goes up.  <BR>  Sounds like I asked for alot and it is but at the lvl you get it at you need it so not truly unbalancing.<BR>  I see about 1 or 2 more diciplins but that is about it and I think you get the picture of what I am trying to project to you here.<P>  GENERAL<BR>  They say the difference between warriors and hybrids is spells but thats now how I think it should really be but a twist on this idea.<BR>  What should be the give and take for tanks is this.<BR>  Spells casting ability vs Superior Disciplines.<BR>  I think Hybrids should have about 5 or 6 and warriors about 14 but not the way they are done now.<BR>  From what I have seen from group with warrior at high lvls is that they got really jiped when it comes to disciplins, once they reach 60 they have a lot of disciplins but mainly just use 1 or 2 and that is such a waste.<BR>  Disciplines should be a warrior defining feature.<BR>  I think all desciplines should have there OWN time table for reset.  I think there should be a 1 min reset time between the different desciplines and a 2 or more min for hybrids.<BR>  Disciplins should be the trade off that warriors get vs spells.  Their desciplines arnt as versitle as spells but they dont suffer all the effects spell casting does which is a HUGE effect.<BR>  Last I think all the tanks should have the same offensive and deffensive and weapon caps.<BR>  It should be there special abilites and spells and desciplins that set them apart and if you dont think so listen to guild chat or players in general when they talk about there char, its not all player envy.<BR>  ITS no use being a hybrid if you can barly hit your mob, you not a spell caster your a tank with spells and the bottom line is how much damage can you do and you cant do any if you cant hit the mob.<P>  BOTTOM LINE<BR>  The bottom line is several things, Groupage, play balance and satisfaction when the day is done.<BR>  The first to you should already understand but the last is what I think I will talk about.<BR>  You should end your day weither you kicked some but or got it kicked knowing your class did the best it could do and any fault was your own or other players, NOT YOUR CLASS.<BR>  Most ppl are smart and will understand if they fight a mob that is not there specialty and someone else is better at it.<BR>  BUT ppl dont like will not be happy if one tank out of all the tanks stands out hands down in every situation.<BR>  Going invis down in guk will not kill a mob. The only thing that really counts for a tank is the Tanking itself.  This game revolves around mainly two things with others just being side orders.  Grouping and fighting is the bottom line, and if your value to a group is WAY LESS and they have a choice of picking super tank then one you havent grouped and two your not in battle and all is for nought and your wasting 10 bucks a month.<BR>  To proclaim a class is defensive in nature and then to make it have lower ac and have a weaker taunt ability does not make tatical sense, no military thinks this way, only manufactures who want money do and dont care what lives it cost.<BR>  If your going to proclaim somthing like that please make somthing that matches what you say.<P>  Bottom line- Grouping, Class satisfaction and fun which will come if the first to happen.<P>  I know alot of this was stuff beides pally stuff but if I didnt write it on one of this topics then it would have gotten buried like my other one did real quick.<BR>  I dont know much about anything when it comes to computers, if anyone can I would like this post put on all the tank forms.<BR>  What I wrote here is from my point of view, it maybe right or wrong but I mainly wrote it as food for thought and not to slam any one class but to help balance them and to make them fun agian.<BR>  To many times now I see paladis and sks just sitting at the zone waiting to get a group but cant cause there are so many warriors that just out do them in damage that they are over looked.<BR>  I wrote this in the idea of if each one of us was special when it comes to damage in our own way that it would all equal out in the long run.<BR>  I think we should all start out and end as equals on the skill caps but its our class features that sets us apart.<P>  I hope some of this has helped and good luck and have fun to all my fellow EQ gamers<P>  L55 Shadow Knight - Haruchai<BR>  L52 Wizard - Arkainus<BR>  L32 Warrior - Baboo<BR>  <BR>  Towers of Elysium<BR>  Saryrn Sever</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>To continue with epic fights, currently the only class that is deemed worthy of receiving ANY heals during the highest level fights is the warriors using the very powerful /disc defensive. To heal any other class is a waste of a clerics mana and will lead to failure. Is this intended Absor?<P>For paladins and SKs to be deemed viable defensive tanks and useful to have on epic encounters, then they MUST be worthy of being healed during the fight. Anything less and they will always be passed over for raid duty.<P>Paladin and SK offensive hit percentage drops to 40% against 56+ npcs due to low offensive skills. Of those blows that land they hit for minimum damage most of the time. This is extremely low damage output in epic battles. Every class that primarily does melee damage, including paladins, must have enough skill to actually inflict that damage at the highest levels.

</FONT><HR>I believe it is in the 50+ range and especially at 55+ that we have some balancing issues.  I want to discuss our balance with regards to melee combat and spell casting prior to the release of Kunark and currently with regards to both roles.<P>Melee (offensive) <BR>--------------------------------------------------<BR>In the scheme of melee damage paladins are in the fourth rank of damage output:<P>1 Monks (suppose to be, actually second)<BR>2 Warriors, Rogues (actually first by a mile)<BR>3 Rangers<BR>4 Paladins, Shadow Knights<P>I believe that prior to Kunark that was actually how the classes balanced, but its not now, and the difference between offensive output by paladins and SK's to the other 3 has grown even larger.<P>This is a point I saw posted somewhere else and its valid.  Paladins and SK's only get double attack, we sacraficed duel wield for our spell casting abilities.  All other melee classes get both duel wield and double attack.  Both Duel Wield (DW) and Double Attack (DA) increase by level, so melee damage for paladins and SK's rises proportionally to level.  Other classes get both DW and DA so their melee damage rises proportionally to level squared.  That is why Paladins and SK's are so weak at melee at high level.<P>These were our skill caps prior to Kunark:<P>               Pal/SK        Warrior        % of warrior ability<BR>Offense           200          210           95.2%<P>Defense           200          210           95.2%<P>Weapon            200          200          100.0%<P>These are our skill caps currently:<P>          Pal/SK   Warrior    % of warrior ability<BR>Offense    225      252                    89.3%<P>Defense    230      252                    92.3%        <P>Weapon    225       250                    90.0%<P>If you look at offensive ability as just the combination of offense and weapon skill, prior to Kunark we were 95.2% as effective as a warrior with our skills.  Currently we have become 80.4% as effective as a warrior just from comparing the offense and weapon skills.  This is a decrease in our melee output compared to a warrior of 14.8%.  But its just not those 2 skills, don't forget the ability to Duel Wield increases damage from melee approximately 30% to 40%.  This skill has actually improved with the release of Kunark and Velious because the skill has increased and will be an even larger advantage now.<P>The cumulative effect of all these offensive differences (Offense, defense, increase DW skill) is similar to the double hybrid mana penatly that Verant found unfair.  The double mana penalty was hybrids had a mana pool penalty and also if we cast the same spell as our parent class it cost hybrids more mana too. Verant realized this double penalty was unfair and eventually made it so hybrids had the same mana pool as their parent casting class when at the same level and wisdom or intelligence as our parent class.  I would ask that you look into this double skill penalty and re-evaluate if its fair.  I personally believe its slightly unbalancing.<P>Melee (defensive)<BR>--------------------------------------------------<BR>Verant has stated that class ranking (tanking) Paladins and SK's are in the second rank:<P>1 Warrior<BR>2 Paladins/SK's<P>There are a few components that make a defensive tank:<P>A) hit points<BR>B) ac<BR>C) defensive skills (Defense, Dodge, Parry, Riposte)<BR>D) disciplines<P>Now lets compare the balance pre-Kunark and currently to a warrior.<P>A) Hit points before Kunark were within a few hundred, now its approximately a difference of 1,000 hps.<P>B) The AC difference has changed from approximately 50 AC to around 150Ac. (approx. figures)<BR>              Pal/SK  Warrior Dif. to warriors<BR>Before Kunark  950      1000       50<P>Currently     1100      1250      150<P>c) The defensive skill caps prior to Kunark:<BR>         Pal/SK   Warrior       % of warrior ability <BR>Defense   200      210            95.2%<BR>Dodge<BR>Parry<BR>Riposte<P>The defensive skill caps currently:<BR>         Pal/SK   Warrior  % of warrior ability<BR>Defense   230       252        91.2%        <BR>Dodge     155       175        88.6%<BR>Parry:    205       230        89.1%<BR>Riposte:  200       225        88.9%<P>Cumulative skill in tanking compared to a warrior = 64%<P>D) We have no melee defensive disciplines.<P>So the margin of difference between warriors for the tanking role has increased in all areas.  In game examples of how this changes the tanking ability of Paladins and SK's relative to warriors.  Prior to Kunark we could substitute for a warrior in all encounters but the two dragons (Vox, Naggy).  I could tank all the giants leading up to Naggy or Vox leading up to attacking them.  I could also tank any mob in Lower Guk and the planes but the Gods.<P>Now with those cumulative decreases in tanking power (less hps, less AC, less skills and no defensive disciplines) I can't tank in place of a warrior in the high level encounters in Velious and Kunark.  If all the warriors in a raid should die, we will die too, because we can't take their place to finish the fight.  Especially in Velious we can't tank the mobs.<P>The cumulative effect of all these defensive differences compared to a warriors is similar to the double hybrid mana penalty hybrids once had.  Verant realized that multiple penalties on our classes was unfair and its unfair in this instance too.  It has caused an imbalance in the game so the only possible tanks are warriors.<P>I have 2 solutions to this problem:<BR>1)  Raise our defensive skills (Dodge, Parry & Riposte) to the same percentage difference to a warrior they were prior to the release of Kunark.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE CHANGE IN DEFENSE SKILL ON TEST, ITS A VERY NICE CHANGE.<P>2)  Give us the discipline defensive at level 55, but with a re-use delay of 30 minutes at level 55 and have it decrease to a re-use delay of 20 minutes at level 60.  This would make paladins only half as effective as warriors even if you increase our skill levels but it will give us the discipline needed to tank the tough mobs in Velious.<P>Another idea, instead of giving us the discipline defensive with twice the re-use delay of a warrior.  Give us a new spell at level 55 called Divine Intervention or Divine Defense.  This spell would stack with any other spell, but it will have the same characteristics as the defensive discipline.  The spell should probably cost a bit of mana (300 to 500 mana maybe), take just 1 sec to cast, but have a long reset time like Divine Aura has, but the reset time should follow the scaling idea I mentioned above.  The nice thing about this spell is it will give Paladins and SK's a useful spell that doesn't have stacking problems with cleric spells, while giving us the ability to tank the velious mobs.  Just please don't have it cost all our mana, because we need our high taunt spells to keep the mobs on us, even if they might have no other effect.<P>Paladins and SK's will still be much worse tanks compared to warriors because of the hp difference, AC difference and continued difference in skills and the fact warriors have many more defensive disciplines to choose from during combat.  I believe this will bring us more in line to how we were balanced prior to the release of Kunark.<P><BR>Spell casting<BR>--------------------------------------------------<BR>1) Paladins need a stun that works on 56 and higher mobs to interrupt their spells.  I am not asking about a stun to slow down their melee attacks, just a stun that if timed correctly can interrupt spells like complete heal and gate.<P>Prior to the release of Kunark we could interrupt all casters except the gods and dragons, now we can't interrupt any caster 56 and higher and I believe that needs to be looked into (in fact nobody can interrupt their spells).  <P>Another possible solution:<BR>Change bash so it can interrupt any caster but a "boss" mob.<P>2)  Our roll as a healer prior to Kunark has been diminished.  Actually, with the release of Kunark <BR>Shamans, Druids and Paladins cannot replace clerics as a healer on anything but the easiest camps.  Priorto Kunark all 3 of us had the same healing spell and if any 2 pcs from those classes were in a group wecould keep up with the healing on all but the boss mobs.  Personally I have been the healer for a group(along with a shaman or druid) for fire giants, ice giants, Seafury Cyclops, the Frienzied Ghoul and king camp in Lower guk.  Prior to Kunark these were some of the toughest camps possible. Now all 3 classes <BR>can't keep up on heals for 55+ encounters in either Velious or Kunark.  <P>My solution is to give all 3 classes (Shaman, Druid, Paladin) Celestial Healing.  <P>I saw that on test you are giving Paladins a spell similar to this spell, but it doesn't heal as many hps and has a very long reset, I believe that in penalizing us double again.  Because we aren't clerics it costs us more mana to cast the spell anyways, and now you also wan't to penalize us in having it heal a lot less hps.  This is a double penalty and not fair or balancing.  <P>Its a level 44 cleric spell and paladins already get some level 44 cleric spells:<P>Cleric spell                Level Pals get it<BR>Yaulp III                       56<BR>Symbol Naltron                  58<BR>Resolution                      60<P>Paladins had the same healing spells as Shaman and Druids prior to Kunark and Paladins were considered balanced.  It seems logical that the same balance should be maintained now and that all 3 classes should have the same healing spells.<P>Currently in Velious the game only requires Clerics, Warriors, Rogues and maybe Monks for chain pulling on a raid, with just enough enchanters and shaman for buffs/debuffs, a necro in case of CR and a mage for COH.  All other classes just cause lag, can't do enough damage compared to the other classes or heal well enough to justify bringing them on the raid, the other classes can fill the roll better.  There are no substitutes for cleric healing and warrior tanking.  Finally the pure casters (Wizards and druids) compared to all the pure melee classes, and even rangers, are outdamage by a wide margin.  Where does this leave Bards, Druids, Paladins, Rangers, Shadow Knights and Wizards in the high level game?<P>*with the change on the donals BP, bards maybe more needed as mana batteries for the clerics*<P>That ends my discussion of the difference in balance between the paladin class prior to Kunark and since the release of Kunark and especially Velious.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>First, thanks for reading this...<P>I believe that the goal to balance should be that all classes should be wanted in some situations.  As it stands now, some classes are either not wanted or less wanted.  That's not balance.  It's not balance to have two classes have a monopoly on two of the six group slots.  <P>Paladins (hybrids) need to bring something to the group WITHOUT causing a hardship on the group, or the pros should AT LEAST out weight the cons.  A raise in one skill, defense, isn't going to drastically change things.  It will help a little, but isn't going to be the thing that dethrowns the mighty warrior (as some warriors are suggesting).<P>It was narrow sighted of Verant to give the exact same skills to hybrids that the parent classes had.  All we are is watered down versions of those classes.  We should be unique (just like cleric and warriors are).  Warriors are right.  With our buffs, we will have more AC than a warrior (not counting our equipment).  Although that changes when you add the cleric that you NEED into the group.  Then our buffs are useless.  <P>Here are a few areas that I feel could use some help and balance:<P>DEFENSE<BR>Raise our defense, parry and riposte skill slightly.  Don't give us the same caps as warriors, but make it close.  Give them the edge here.  It's only fair.  Don't raise only the defense skill.  It makes no sense.  Knights are supposed to be able to parry and riposte.  We'll be harder to hit (although not as tough as a warrior) and our offense will be raised slightly due to the increase in riposte.<P>OFFENSE<BR>Raise our 2HS cap.  I use a two handed sword more than any warrior I know.  Verant has already stated that they view the SKs and Paladins as the ones wielding big two handed swords.  Compensate us in some way for not being able to dual wield.  Not much though, just enough for balance.<P>BASH<BR>Raise our bashing skill.  We are called on to stop casters from casting, let us do it.  Let the warriors cause the melee damage with their blades while we help them by interupting casters.  The only time I wield a shield is to bash.<P>TAUNT<BR>We should be the best taunters and we are.  Keep it that way.  I few a paladin as almost a religious fanatic.  Who better to jump in front of a blade?<P>BUFFS<BR>Give us buffs that stack with clerics/druids/shamen.  Warriors wouldn't complain because they'd benefit from our buffs too and would still have their ego fed from having more AC.  Stackable buffs would make us more attractive to a group.<P>HEALING<BR>Not much to say here.  I can't be the main healer for a group and I don't think that should be the Paladins job.  We should be able to bale out a group spell that is sort of like LoH that will work on a group.  Very short casting time with a long recast time.<P>EQUIPMENT<BR>Why do all palading use the same equipment?  Lack of variety.  I'm tire of being a cookie cutter, give me some choices.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>DISCIPLINE<BR>We need a raid discipline.  A AE uber taunt would be perfect.  It would give the casters enough time to nuke, heal, or evac and give the melees time to reposition and attack.  Have make the paladin the sole person on the list.  It would cancel all buffs, including DA.  It would be very risky for the paladin, but usefull.  If need be, make a mob immune to the affects of this disc if it's already been used on him.<P><BR>Thanks for listening!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Not much i can elaborate on after reading all this. All i can say is my paladin is broken and its up to verant to fix him, Paladins are mostly unwanted in dragon raids and epic encounters on my server, even in routine group encounters the pally is always picked last.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> Why do paladins get an unusual amount of Charisma at creation time?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>So far from what I have read of the ideas most are great.<P>On having the ability to naturally do critical hits and cripling blows to undead mobs is a great idea and since pallys ARE holy knights and undead specialists I wonder why this wasn't done earlier.  To bad there aren't any undead zones post 50 though and the undead mobs in zones are few (no lower guk dead side for post 50).<P>On having LoH work as a complete heal by level 60, I think that should be there already also especially with the difficulty of the mobs how many hit points they have and the amount of damage they dish out.  At lvl 60 why not allow this?  All pure casters and priest classes as well as rogues and monks have the ability to insta kill, I can understand not giving SKs that ability with their HT but what's wrong with making pallys LoH an insta life at lvl 60?  With all the clerics and other healers out there it's not going to inbalance the healers or give us a group healer job from it.<P>On a defensive discipline where the pally takes the damage of a group member or all group members, sorry to say I think that is a terrible idea and would do more harm than it would be useful.  Pallys would die more often using this which would slow group progress down or it would never be used because with 3 stuns taunt a tiny DD spell and our rune and heal spells we can or should be able to keep mobs off anyone we want to.<P>On the defensive skill caps it's great about raising defense to match warriors but we still won't be able to tank any better unless we have higher riposte parry and dodge skills.  <P>On weapons, we have none.  Over half of our weapons are quest/epic for post 50.  Duel weilders are getting awesome weapons and many of them are not hard to obtain.  Our weapons should match them in damage/delay compared to 2 weapons being used by a duel weilder.  Most of these newer pure melee weapons have better ratios than any pally weapons.<P>On offense, we have none.  Groups and raids these days are damage oriented, can't produce a decent amount of damage can't come along then and that's pretty much how it is unless it's your guild or friends.  Reduce the amount of misses we get and improve our arsenal of weapons (especially good weapons that can compare with duel weilders) and you will fix a major problem with the pally class balance issue.<P>On defensive disciplines, we don't have one but yet we are considered and even verant has said it themselves that we are a defensive class.  Well if monks of all classes can get a defensive disc allowing them to take 1 tenth the amount of dmg done and it has a refresh rate of 12 minutes then why can't pallys have some type of defensive disc?  One that has a faster refresh rate than 67 minutes which is the max for a level 60.  Sanctification is a nice disc although I rarely use it but it in no way should be considered a defensive disc.  If you have high resist gear you shouldn't be taking that much dmg from nukes, it's the melee dmg that kills.<P>On heals, pallys have always been up to par with shamans and druids with the direct heal spells (they have the regen line as well) because we are more of a priest than any other melee.  If druids and shamans get a new healing spell then by all means give pallys one also.  The level 59 heal spell that was put on TS is terrible (/em wants to say something inapropriate).  We have a 600hp heal (well it varies between 540 and 600 but I haven't checked it out) at 57 it has no recast time.  It does take 3.5 seconds to cast if I am remembering correctly but if it's speed to save lives we don't need anymore of those.  We have LoH which is the 1st and primary source of last minute saves, then we have divine favor which became a 2ndary source and alternative to using the long refreshing LoH.  Then we got wave of healing which is probably the worst mana efficient group oriented spell in game and has a 1 minute recast time but it is extremely fast cast time for 200hp (that's like 2 pixels of health for me when I'm buffed btw).  So there we have 3 life savers on top of our regular heal, but as you know the velious mobs don't all have a hit point cap on them (many have well over 32k hp) and therefore more mana is needed for heals and since they do more dmg than your average kunark mob better heals are needed.  600hp heal isn't going to make it when mobs triple hit for over 150dmg for low blues and then tougher mobs hitting for 200s.  So again a 440hp heal that comes in 4 ticks is going to be worthless to us regardless of the casting time.  We need an improvement to superior heal just like druids and shamans.<P>My suggestion on the healing issue is give rangers a spell with that is a dot heal for 440hp in 4 ticks since druids are getting a better heal.  And give pallys celestial healing (lvl 44 cleric heal) instead of celestial cleansing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

But personally I would really love to see the whole epic 2hs, transformable into a 1hander and a sheild.  We have been missing out on the 1hs for far too long.  Also we should get crits and stuff against the undead after a certain level, not a silly disc.  Make the disc let us land the crips every hit for 10-15seconds or something.

</FONT><HR>Absor I think you are missing the point on paladin disciplines/spells and their complete inadequacy for raids.<P>PROBLEM<P>We can only use one of our spells for a raid - DIVINE STRENGTH - all of our other spell are completely and totally and unquestionably useless on a raid.  This means we are not going to be invited on a raid until we are level 60 and only 1-2 paladins per raid are going to be invited to buff this single spell and then we will be told to sit in the corner and let the real tanks attack the mob. NONE of our disciplines are worth the hotkey to use. Please revisit this issue - I would humbly suggest that sitting in the corner if you won the lotto and got invited on a raid or not being invited at all on a raid is not Verrant's idea of balance. <P>SOLUTION <P>There have been a number of solutions proposed. <P>1. Allow paladins to absorb damage directed at another.<P>2. Allow paladins to sacrifice themselves by dying but heal the other members of the party. <P>3. Allow paladins some defensive-like discipline appropriate for the defensive tanks we are (such as the holy shield discipline I proposed). <P>Whatever option you choose, paladins should get it at 55 so that we can participate in raids. Please relook and reconsider your position on this issue. It is the most important enhancement that we can receive and the one most desperately needed. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm just curious as to why people refer to the "Traditional" paladin has wielding a sword and shield.<P>The "traditional" paladin in AD&D's best weapon was a Holy Avenger, a Two handed weapon.<P>I've used a two hander's since level 40, starting with the soulfire, switching to a Theologian claymore, then a skarlon, a Polyphenominal axe, a firey avenger, and finally the firey defender. Two handers ROCK. I love two handers. <P>I think the people who are begging for Paladins to be able to wield a Sword and Shield aren't really playing the "high-level" post-50 game (which is the ONLY place I honestly feel paladins need adjustment) and don't really realize the value of BIG two handers and high damage output.<P>Although I wouldn't be opposed to the idea which I saw allowing the FD to be quested into a 1 handed sword (provided it was able to keep the damage bonus.)<P>If you're considering changing the effect on the weapon (which I'm not really at all for) somethign along the lines of Wizards "divine barrier" would certainly be Epic.<P>Adding a /defensive type discipline would be a excellent and welcome addition to paladins, I'd be all for that. I'm sure there's more, but I'm at work. <P>Just my 20,000 pp.<P><BR>Allroy Bustardo Level 56 Knight<BR>Cohort Chalybeius<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I just have 3 issues on my mind since most of the others will be covered repeatly by other paladins.<P>-Self-only Invis for high level clerics/paladins by way of spell or by way of a seperate unlimited invis items for each class that would be fairly obtainable at 55+. All other classes pretty much have free roam of low level dungeons like Droga and Crystal Caverns by the time they are Lvl 60. Clerics and paladins are still forced to carry bunches of unstackable invis potions if they want to do the same. Even warriors (the last class that should have the ability to invis) have unlimited invisibility by way of at least 2 items in game: cobalt greaves and incardine breastplate.<P>-I would like to see an increase in the drop rate of the frost book (vox book) for the paladin FA off of Kunark dragons.  I only know of 2 frost books dropping off Kunark dragons in almost a year on the Tarew Marr server. It is insanely hard for high level paladins ro obtain who can't really participate on vox raids because of the level cap and the book is extremely rare off her as well.  Only 2 FAs have been completed on TM since the cap and both books came off of vox.  Its almost a joke in comparison to the number of epics being acquired by other classes. I have seen several posts wanting 1h epics and shield but those are just the people who have obtained the FD.  I'd be happy if I could just get the FD.<P>-Adjustment of spells on DW armor.  Warriors, Rogues, and Bards have 7 spells on their Kunark armor not native to their class.  Rangers have 3 non-native spells.  Paladins will only have 1 spell on their armor not-native to their class if current changes on test server go through. Most of the current spells on DW armor are pretty useless to our class unlike warriors getting invis and rangers getting a port spell and summons arrows.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Regarding LoHs.  It seems that whenever an issue is made with Loh's effectiveness it is fixed by simply increasing the Hit Points that it heals. I would like to suggest a different aproach and instead of simply healing HP, make LoHs also heal other inflections that are on the target, such as all diseases, poisons and other appropriate afflections. This would be a good way to increase the effectiveness of LoHs as an emercency use ability, without it healing an unbalancing amount of HP.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I've been reading the posts of fellow Paladins and thought I'd add my 2cp.  I'm only a 34th level Paladin, so these are the problems the plague a variety of UNDER 50 Paladins.  First and foremost, i'd like to say that i like the changes on Test, and would appricate them being brought onto the live servers.  My biggest complaint however is SoulFire!  For the amount of time and energy put into the quest, I don't feel we have enough reward when somone says "dood, just go get a Mith 2H or Xalgoz!" and those weapons that drop off of one around 40th lvl MOB are on par with the first "Flaming Holy Blade".   SoulFire takes a LOT of time and energy to obtain, including building faction, completing the testamony/letter quests, then waiting a few levels to stage a raid on Mistmoore to defeat a lvl 45 SK and his minions for the Hilt of the blade alone!  Getting the Brilliant Sword of Faith and slaying Lucan takes another raid, this time destroying your faction in Freeport.     What do I ask for this time well spent? only 1 thing: Bash.  Yes, I want to bash with my SoulFire.  You can bash with both the Fiery Avenger, Fiery Defender, and (maybe?) Nature's Defender.  I think that for the time and work, this is NOT an unfair request for the level and will make the first Paladin's Flaming Sword special again. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Greetings,<P>4) Paladins: <P><BR>a) Add Endure Magic spell at level 30 <P>- Useful at this level, good addition.<P>b) Add Resist Magic at 55 <P>- Always welcome.<P>c) Move Guard spell from 49 to 39 <P>- Flipoff, how about giving us a new AC stackable spell instead? Group ac spell?<P>d) Move Armor of Faith from 53 to 49 <P>- Check answer on C.<P>e) New level 53 paladin spell, Divine Glory, clone of divine strength but 100 hp instead of 200 <P>- Pretty useless, make Divine strength 400hp and glory 200hp and it will be decent.<P>f) New level 59 spell, Celestial Cleansing 110 hp healdot per tick, for 4 ticks. 1.5 second casting time. Recast time 30 secs. <P>- Really not good at all at this level, heal for 440hp for 225mana in around 24sec? Then a tick (6sec) before you can recast it. At this level mobs hit for insane damage, really this spell wont even take up a slot for me if it will be like this. A 60% nerfed celestial healing, what a joke really. Why not give us a 10% improved Celestial healing, or at least the celestial healing spell?<P>g) Defense skill cap made exactly same as warriors<P>- Good, but still... some more ac are decent, maybe another 2sec alive vs VS or whatever. If we get ripose/dodge etc improved as much we maybe even can survive a few more seconds. What we really need is a defensive disc, an unique one, not the warrior one.<P><BR>Druids and Shamans get sup heal at 51, less fizzles as well. Also remedy like spell at 55.<BR>We get sup heal at 57. If they are getting sup heal this early I really think it would be fair to give paladins sup heal at 54 or 55, less fizzles. And a new healing spell at 57.<BR>We are part of the cleric, remember? I mean why shall every non-hybrid class be able to give so much more then a hybrid can?<P>Idead:<P>Lvl 49: New AC group buff, stackable with clerics buffs.<BR>Lvl 50: Change flame of light to deal 150dmg instead of 125, also recast time 15sec. Then at least I will have it in a spell slot.<BR>Lvl 51: Replace pacify with summon drink and food. Pacify are SO useless.<BR>Lvl 54: Superior Healing, less fizzling. Replace Enstill with immobilze.<BR>Lvl 55: Wave of Healing, make it heal more, or move it to a lower level.<BR>Lvl 56: Replace Yaulp III with Yaulp IV.<BR>Lvl 57: Give us a remedy kind of spell.<BR>Lvl 59: Give us Celestial Healing, unnerfed.<P><BR>Overall, Paladins offensive and defensive output are pitful. Really... An increasement of the defense is a good step. We still need increase in riposte/dodge etc to even be able to survive high lvl encounters and raids. Sure we can survive grouping in Karnors, Sebilis etc. And are a pretty decent class there, but hello? When coming to high lvl encounters etc we will just die in secs. We really need increasement in both offensive and defensive caps. As well a useful high lvl defensive disc. No, not holy joke, errr forge I mean. <P><BR>Give us critical and crippling blows vs undeads, starting at lvl 55.<BR>Remove holy joke (forge) disc and replace it with a useful defensive disc. Or remove it and just replace our lvl 60 disc with a useful defensive disc.<P>Increase defensive to the cap warriors have. I cant see anything unbalancing in this at all. Really, Warriors got higher ac anyway, more hp, more discs, better dmg/delay weapons. They can dual wield etc. And their ripose etc caps are higher then ours.<P>Increase our offensive cap a bit, and as well 1hs/2hs/1hb/2hb etc a bit. Riposte/dodge etc as well a bit. <P>This is in no way unbalancing. Its just a step in the right way to give us the option to be able to do something nice in a high lvl raid. And at least be able to take and deal some damage.<P>Our spell line are really unbalancing if we shall compare to the clerics line. I have tryed to list what I want to see changed here and why. Really if druids get the spells listed, shamans as well. I think what I am asking for (and I know many agrees with me) are just fair and not unbalancing to the clerics, nor the other classes spells. Really, Complete Heal hello?<P>Regarding effects on our deepwater, wow a low lvl symbol buff, cancel magic, daring (nerfed) etc. Lol.<P>Compare that to the clerics.<P>---cut---<P>2 summaries.<BR>qouting my reply about spell in another thread:<BR>-------------<BR>"Celestial Cleansing may not be the be all and end all of healing, but with a cast time of only 1.5 seconds, you've got a fair<BR>chance of being able to save someones life if you're on your toes! You'll give them that few more seconds needed for the<BR>CH to hit! You'll never be able to heal them totally, but if you were to use Celestial Cleansing well, I can almost guarantee<BR>it'll be the first heal to hit home... That's a nice addition to the Paladin class.."<BR>---------------<BR>This is how I thought of it at first too, but then I thought about it some more and realized how much the spell actually sucked<P>new 59 spell:<BR>after 1.5 seconds(cast time) target gets a 110 heal<BR>(this assumes it gives a heal like that immediately on cast)<P>6 seconds later(7.5 sec in) target gets another 110 heal (220 total so far)<BR>6 seconds later(13.5 sec in) target gets another 110 heal (330 total so far)<BR>6 seconds later(19.5 sec in) target gets another 110 heal (440 total)<P>superior heal:<BR>after 4.5 seconds, targets get a 530hp-540 hp heal<BR>And superior heal is more mana effcient<P>the ONLY advantage to new spell is that it can provide a 110 heal 3 seconds earlier than other spell, but after that point<BR>superior heal provides instant heal for more than the entire new spell.<P>After realizing this, the spell sucks and even with the above suckyness it has a 30 second recast time, and doesnt stack<BR>with cleric Line of spells<P>So, I will never mem new spell unless it's changed.<P>===================================<BR>qouting part of Nomisesaar's post in another thread: /wave nomi<BR>-----<BR>I think the point of Verant giving us spells such as Wave of Healing, Divine Favor, and Celestial Cleansing is to make us<BR>into "life savers". Along with the ability to use Lay of Hands, these 4 spell/ability are good for saving lives, on paper.<P>However, in actual practice, because of recover time of the spells with the amount of damage they heal vs the damage<BR>the mobs inflict, Those spells have practically no use at all. <P>Wave of healing would be a better spell if its recover time was made the same as a normal spell, with the low real rate<BR>and high mana cost (higher mana/hp ratio than that of a cleric group heal) if it can be chain casted, it may have some use.<P>Divine Favor, due to the low damage absorption, it doesn't work too well as a life saving spell especially with the 6 min<BR>recast. Instead, the spell may be better used as an extra buff similar to the enchanter Bedlam line. Giving it double cast<BR>time with 0 recast, along with an increase in duration to 30 mins, it might make the spell worth using. At least it will fall<BR>more in line with SK's ability to cast Diamond Skin on Test server. <P>Also Celestrial Cleansing's healing/mana ratio is poor, along with recover time making it really not worth using. Like said<BR>before, the life saving spells, although looks good on paper, does not work so well in practice due to the amount of<BR>damage mobs do along with the long recover time. Also the ability for Celestrial Elixer to overwrite such a spell makes it<BR>worthless.<P>=================================================<BR>my opinion:<BR>I really do think we should ask for it to be removed and replaced with something usefull, or at least not waste an "improvement" on it.<P>Ideally what I think it would be to move superior heal from 57 to 55/56 (druid shaman went from 53 to 51)<BR>But would be fine if it stayed at 57 really.<P>And then delete this spell, and at 60, either give us level 44 cleric celestial healing(or close in power), Or something similar to divine light(clr)<P>as it is now, the heal they gave us heals less, is less mana efficient, and due to it's dot nature, isn't even really a quick heal spell. <P>---cut---<P><BR>We got a very weak version of lvl 44 cleric spell celestial healing, sk's got a full strength lvl 49 and 44 necro spell. Thats not fair, its unbalancing. Why keep whining, get the facts before even whining about what we get. Its still not at all close to being balancing here.<P>HOWEVER, Lvl 60 paladins (and SKs) will still be unacceptable as tanks for big mobs. I dont mean worse than warriors, I mean unviable. A SK or Paladin CANNOT tank a big velious mob. Period. Without /disc defensive the mobs just hit too hard for complete heal to be used, and any other healing is just too mana intensive for the length of time it takes to kill these big mobs with over 32k hp.<P>Do you know how some big guilds treat their hyrbids? First, they are encouraged to start new warriors and stop causing lag. However, if they inisist on playing their hybrids, they are told they are on their own. Hybrids get no heals on big mobs. They must be responsible enough to not draw agro, because they will get no heals from the clerics. Why? Because complete heal is not going to land in time, and anything else means the cleric is going to be OOM too soon while healing the important people (warriors).<P>The healing dot is a joke. It is not going to stack with celestial healing so I'm not going to waste a spell slot on it.<P>The added defense is nice, but without defensive disc, its just not going to make a difference. They could give paladins and SKs defensive disc, equal defensive skill caps, equal dodge/parry/reposte skill caps and they STILL would be much worse tanks than warriors (but a viable secondary choice).<P><BR>Darkd Damodred<BR>52th Cavalier</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Paladin only weapons. We were shorted as a class in Kunark as far as class only weapons are concerned. I do hope SoV does something to address this issue, however SoV is more designed for large raids and high end encounters (or so I gather) so the Paladin only weapon shortage in kunark still needs addressing.

</FONT><HR>Absor - Thanks for taking the time to go through all this.  I have read these posts and made notes along the way of ideas that I liked.  You got most of them on your list except one:<P>The paladin buffs are nice, but they do not stack with cleric (obviously), druid or ranger buffs.  Please change these spells to have the same effects, same power, but make them stack with other buffs.  This would make paladins more versitile while not changing the power of the class.  I think versatility, not more power is the way to balance the class and make us desirable for group situations.<P>I think the changes on test now are great, and really help out the class.  I am still in my development years (35) and do not have the worries that the post 50 crowd is posting about, but you need to remember that the only way to get to 50+ is to go through the first 49 levels!! </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Fiery Defender is an adequate Epic Weapon, but is perhaps the worst of all meleer weapons in terms of power, and perhaps the least well suited to it's class' needs. Many people have suggested an optional extension to the Paladin Epic Quest that lets us trade it in for a great Shield and Sword combination (much like the offhand/mainhand sword combination that Rangers have). In my opinion this would be one of the best things that could be done. The one thing i would have to add to that would be to make lower combos. Like a seperate quest inline with the soulfire. When you have both counterparts equipped some type of effect like a small ac atk buff would be cast on you and ii wouldnt come off till you unequipped one of the pieces. This effect would be stackable with all other buffs. Imo i would much rather have a sword sheild combo rather than a 2hs weapon. Also it would make a pally look more like a pally.<P>Mogradal Soulredeemer<BR>Lvl 31 Paladin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I know the topic has come up before, and I know that Verant has been very firm in their stance, but I think it is high time we take another look at the topic.  It has long been said that "melee classes will never get bind and gate."  I'm not sure I understand the reasoning behind this, but should non-melee classes be held to the same restriction?  Paladins and Shadow Knights are not melee class!!   This is by Alan's own statements during the SK discussions (keep in mind that this was in response to a question which was about Shadow Knights AND Paladins):<P>"Heh, not really. Firstly, shadow knights are hybrids, not a melee class. It's perfectly acceptable that a melee class like the rogue be doing more damage than a hybrid in combat. Rogues don't get spells. And rangers are the melee damage dealing hybrid. Paladins and shadow knights are far more defensive in their abilities. And, well, we could talk about how shadow knights compare in melee damage to bards… <P>Keep in mind that shadow knights are a hybrid, not a melee class. They will, therefore, not be equal to the melee classes in straight combat ability, that is the price you pay for the ability to cast spells. "<P>Why is it that hybrids are given the no bind/no gate penalty.  Paladins and Shadow Knights are given less offensive abilities, rangers are given less defensive abilities.  All hybrids have fewer hit points.  All-in-all, we die more often ... this means we are sent back to our bind points more often ... which means we have to run across treacherous zones naked more often ...  with fewer hit points ... which means that we die more often ... you get the point.<P>If we are not to be given the benefits of the melee class, why can we not have more of the benefits of the caster class?  If you don't want to give us the full boat on bind and gate, consider the following options:<P>1.  Bind and gate available at a higher level ... such as 20 or 25, when more dangerous and further removed zones are beginning to be employed.<P>2. Make gate available to hybrids, but not bind.  Instead, make them "bindable", which would mean that they can be bound anywhere by a caster, but not able to cast the spell without someone's assistance.<P>3.  Make bind self-only for hybrids, so that they do not userp the casters ability to bind others.<P>SECOND POINT<P>A lot has been said about giving Paladin's a horse.  One bright poster came up with the concept of an illusion of a knight on his steed.  The response was mildly positive, but followed by some weak excuses why not.  I understand that Enchanters have a problem with others having illusion, and that you want to save future illusions for them, but will giving Paladin's one really take anything away from them?  Other concerns are that equiped weapons wont be visible, and that all paladins in the illusion would look the same.  I have never been able to distiguish one druid wolf from another, nor one enchanter earth elemental from another, and you generally don't see a bear with a staff in his hands.<P>What I suggest is :<P>A self only illusion of a knight on a horse, with some degree of enhanced foot speed, usefull for travel only, much like Scale of Wolf, which allows the player to travel from one point to another at a greater speed, but is cancelled if the player strikes NPC or casts any spells.  <BR>We don't care if our personal armor shows or not, we don't care if our personal weapons show or not, we don't mind looking alike.  I think all Paladin's agree, we need a horse.  (Give SK a horse too ... white for Paladin's, black for SK)<P>THIRD POINT<P>It's a long shot, but couldn't you improve our healing abilities a triffle?  Greater healing at level 51 doesn't even fill a bubble.  I don't understand why druids are made to be such better healers than the clerics offspring.<P><BR>FOURTH (not class balancing, but definitely on my wish list) POINT<P>Is there any way to make the scroll wheel on the mouse function for the chat window.  It is a hastle and time waste to try to scroll back to look for that tell that went screaming past during a fight.  I don't know what kind of programming nightmare it would be, but it sure would make life easier.  If that is not possible, is there a way to use an alt command to scroll the text?  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I would support the idea of making the yaulp series a bit more useful (i.e. lowering the levels at which we get each yaulp spell). I would also agree with raising the defense cap of the paladin. <P>One thing that I think has been neglected is the lack of good 1 hand weapons for paladins.  While we do have a 24/30 weapon, this drops off of a dragon, beyond that we have the seypherwind, which only 4 of 5 people in ALL of everquest have).  Beyond that, paladins end up weilding sword of the mournings and jade maces for a 1h weapon.  Those who think the sword of mourning is a powerful weapon are kidding themselves.<P>I am not asking to make us output as much damage as a warrior, by no means is this the point of our class, but we do need a bit of variety of descent 1h weapons, of which we are lacking.<P>I would hate to think that my only option as a paladin if I want to do damage is to somehow get a dragon item.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Pretty much everything i could think of was covered. Although i will say the Epic Quest is by no means that Epic and the reward is comparativly lame when compared to almost all the other Epic Weapons. Also the fact that most paladins who were 53+ when the dragon change went live will never own an FA let alone FD is somewhat disgusting. You made this change and you should have modified the quest somehow and put the books elsewhere on a mob that only drops the books for this quest, make the mob an Epic fight, Gorenaire and Talendor are not an option and wont ever be for many of these Paladins that got hit with the change, yes i know that not every paladin is supposed to get their epic weapon but you are not giving most a fair shake of the stick with the quest in its current form. I dont own an FA or FD, but if i wanted one im pretty sure i could organize a raid to kill Vox/Nag for the books, but where is the Epicness in hanging around these dragons not actually fighting and getting the books? Before people jump on the "Kill Talendor and Gorenaire* Bandwagon, my guild on Rathe (Noble Blade) is the 2nd only guild on the server i believe to have killed Talendor, i could be wrong *shrug* and we arent far off being able to take out Gorenaire either, but i feel simply placing the books on these 2 dragons was just lazy and not well thought out.

</FONT><HR>I will make this fairly short as much of what I have to say has been covered.<BR>Bash is a primary paladin skill through their life no one uses a shield as much we do but our skill does not reflect. We do not have duel wield nor in truth do many of use want it. We have bash please raise the skill to level of or over that of warriors. Increase our chance of stunning the 56+ mobs not the bosses so much as the commons this is the primary asset of a paladin without which we are medicore warrior.<P>Defense - We are defensive tank we need the best defense definitely as high as warrior if not 5 or 10 points over.<P>Offense - We don't need more damage but we do need less missing. A low delay weapon minimizes this to some extent such as the jade mace but our class weapons have higher delays and it shows in combat. I am not sure what all determines how much you miss but this needs looked at for us if not all classes.<P>Healing - I noticed you gave better heals to every healing class but us I am not sure how the healing rates but moving superior down a couple levels would be wise and useful not to mention allowing spell skills to go up to compensate for fizzles on higher level spells. This applies to all classes not just us.<P>Look at our deepwater and gear an honestly determine the usefulness of it. Soothe never used, Cancel magic not useful considering spell casting time. Daring also not as useful as giving us a higher level buff with the long casting time which would also endear us to raids. Symbol on breasplate requires a spell component this useless as who is going to carry to sets of spell components around.<P>This is some of my thoughts as paladin.<P>Ironwind Dreamseeker<BR>51st Paladin of Brell<BR>Lightbringer of Misericordia<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ABSOR, there has been alot of talk about how often the paladin spells fizzle and indeed they do fizzle an incredible amount.  I play a level 60 pally and have fizzled 4 times in a row still but otherwise usually only 1 or 2 is normal.  This is a problem because as hybrids we are generally not going to max out wisdom so we have less mana than our parent class but use the same spells with the same mana cost.  On top of that we can't specialize in any magic which is also a big plus to casters.<P>Give hybrids the ability to specialize at level 60.  Why you might ask?  Because the normal trend for hybrids is to get the parent class spells or abilities at around twice the level (that's not accurate just an example).  Priest classes get specialize at level 30 and pure casters at lvl 20 so there really isn't any reason why a half priest (hybrids) shouldn't be able to specialize in magic at some point especially at their current max level.  To be fair to casters and priests though there would be a lower cap on it, but specialize is one of the key factors in reducing fizzles and resists (although I have never seen the text saying so and so resisted superior healing).  <P>Give hybrids the specialize ability but with a lower cap than pure casters!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The Problem with Paladins<P>In D&D Paladins were a feared and respected class. However in EQ they are the weakest fighting class bar none. Paladins are badly out-damaged by all duel-weilding classes. In the SK discussion they mentioned that they are tied with Pali’s for the poorest melee dmg of any melee class, but they have Dots, Lifetaps, and a Pet which gives them stacking damage. Paladins have no such method of doing extra. Why should an Anti-Paladin far out-damage a Paladin? SK’s can solo a HG many lvl’s before a Pali.<P>One might argue that Paladin’s are more on the defensive side of things with their buffs and healing capability. But here too they are ineffective. A Paladins healing is crippled until lvl 39 when they get Greater healing, and again after 50 when only a clerics superior healing, and complete heal really matters. <P>Paladins are the worst melee class in the game doing far less damage than monks, rangers, warriors, and yes SK’s. They are the worst healers along with Rangers, far behind druids and shamans (which are getting increased even further). It matters little that a Paladin can both tank and heal. If you want someone to do damage pick a warrior, monk, ranger, etc. If you want a healer take a cleric, druid, shaman. A Paladin is one of the least needed grouping classes in the game.<P>The Paladin is the farthest from being in balance with the other classes and needs the most fixing by any objective observor.<P>Here are three things that can be done to fix the Paladin class:<P>1.	Increase Taunt.  The one thing Pali’s have is the 2nd most hp’s after warriors, but this does a party no good if he cannot taunt the mobs off the casters. This seems like a reasonable suggestion to make him wanted.<P>2.	Increase Bash Skill: Pali’s and SK’s are the only classes that use shield (warriors duel weild) increase the skill cap of bash so they may interrupt casters making them useful on group raids.<P>3.	Make LOH a once a day complete heal.  Its only once a day but his life-saving potential suddenly makes him a valuable thing to have in a group. If this cannot be done then make it reversable to HT undead. This would also help define Paladins as the ultimate warriors vs the undead, which is really what they should be. (see next comment).<P>4.	Critical Hits vs the Undead: Pali’s should be the masters of fighting the undead. This at least makes him more valuable in certain dungeons.<P>5.      Damage Shields vs the Undead. In this way a Pali can solo some vs undead, and can benefit a group fighting them.<P>6.	The Paladin War Horse: In D&D Pali’s got a war horse at higher lvl’s. Shamans have great healing, can tank some, have dots, nukes, and a pet at lvl 34. They are an adequate solo'g class for the most part. Give Pali’s a war horse pet say at 39. This would at least increase his damage output some. As it is they are the least damaging class in the game. They should be more than that.<P>One Final Note: Eq will never be balanced as long as Druids are what they are. They Receive: Sow, Snare (god-like), Harmony (god-like), Nukes, Dots, Regen, Healing, HP Buffs, Damage Shields, and Teleports. Wow. No class should be allowed to quad kite, they can solo all the way to 55 as is if they want to. Heck just give them duel weild and backstab then there will be no need to play any other class and we can rightly rename the game Dr00dQuest, which it almost is already. A Paladin cant solo hardly at all, but I guess asking for a war horse would some how be unbalancing. Ya right.<P>Thanks for listening.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>In case this was errased before you read it..<P>- Increase Bash skill for paladin and SK so that we have the highest skill cap, currently we have no offencive/defencive skills that are highest.. none (and we are the only two shield using classes, considering all other shield users have duel weild)<BR>- Give paladin "summon bandages" at lvl 15, and clerics the spell at lvl 4, not only does it give purpose to conjure, but it is something we can make and hand out to less-fortunate non-healers, which is a kind act.<BR>- Increase defense skills like perry/dodge (dont bother raising repost, because thats an offencive one, just do the defencive ones)<P>This idea, PLEASE read it carefully, you may like it:<P>A new skill for all tanks "endurence".. which for warriors can be practiced at lvl 40, and paladin/sk at 50.. what it does is each skill point adds additional HP to the class permently, goes up like defence.. let me explain why I am putting this in.<P>Right now, all tanks even warriors are just killed one at a time on large epic enchounters.. or dragons, basically just "how fast can we kill the monster before the tanks are killed one at a time"  quad hits from a 800hp hitting mob in places in vellious, doesnt matter how many HP you have, thats insane...<P>Make it for warriors when the skill is capped out to add close to 1500hp, and paladin/sk 1000, and rangers bards ect 750.. I mean its a big thing.<P>With this, clerics using CH will also be more useful... its gotten to the point where you make mobs hit WAY to hard for even large groups to keep one person alive, its very sad.. and if a monster can have 10's of thousands of HP why cant a warrior or knight have even a small fraction of it?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm glad to see the new Paladin only spells introduced in velious, and the addition of Devine Glory is a good idea. It would be nice to see the divine line extended down further into the the lower level, as well as other paladin only spells. As well as some of the existing spells that are underused and are in need of adjusting. I would suggest something on the lines of:<P>Divine favour:  level 39, 30-50 HP<BR>Divine Blessing: level 20 or 30  10-25 HP<P>Replace the summon hammer spells with:<P>Holy Sword:  level 15   2 hand slashing, magical sword (no drop, no rent) damage 8 delay 30<P>Sacred Blade: level 30   1 hand slasher, magical sword (no drop, no rent) damage 10 delay 28<P>Shield of Faith: Level 30 or 39   AC: 5 Shield magical (no drop, no rent)<P>These are more appropriate to the paladin's skills and are also useful tools. Turn a line of unused spells into an effective utility for paladins. At 15 many paladins don't own a magical weapon and so this would be useful for encounters that require a magical blade. Also the weapon could be used to build the paladin's 2-hand slashing up if he didn't own a 2 hander yet.<P>The summoning of a one handed sword and later a shield would be a great asset for paladins true this weapon couldn't be compared to the weapon the paladin already has, but for the adventuring paladin with a 2 handed sword, being able to summon a 1 hander and a shield would be very useful. (especially when using a slow sword and confronted with a caster, the paladin's first thought is "if only I had a 1-hander and a shield")<P>Yaulp Series:<BR>make yaulp last longer even if it's at the cost of more manna. (even if it is effective, It gets boring fast heh)<P>Reckless Strength: this is a buff I give to people I don't like, minus 10 strength to a tank, cruel joke. maybe replace this with another spell I would suggest the following.<P>Holy Frenzy: 5 to 10% haste, +.2% per level. +20 Str, +20 dex (stackable with all spells) lasts a short period of time, but results in a massive stamina drain.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, I posted a long message on the old thread, however I wanted to re-iterate, incase it was deleted before Alan could read it:<P>Needed changes for paladins (Going to be brief)<P>-&gt; Defense raised to 252<BR>-&gt; Discipline: Defensive added at level 58 or so.<BR>-&gt; Dodge, Parry, Riposte raised to within 10-15 points of warriors<P><BR>Those are the needed thing for melee.<P>Spell changes:<P>Celestial Cleansing:  From what I have seen, this spell is 225 mana for a 440hp heal over time.  First off, why do we get a heal that is less mana efficient then superior heal, and pay the penalty of waiting 4 ticks for it to work?  Give us the cleric spell "Celestial Healing" instead.<P>Divine Glory/Divine Strength:  Divine strength is way too underpowered for the level at which we receive it.  Rangers get a buff at level 50 that does not stack with ours and is arguably equal, granting 25atk in addition to 75hp.  Make Divine Strength Level 53, and add Divine Glory at Level 60 -&gt;  Add 450hp Max to target, Add 15ac to target.  Thanks.<P>Finally, Please let us stun mobs L56+.  Stunning is the paladin's forte in melee combat, by taking it away from us at high levels you reduce the class to little more then extra lag.<P>Thank you,<P>Rennol<BR>Level 60 Crusader<BR>Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055491-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055491.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055491-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055491-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055491-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055491-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055491-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055491&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055491&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
