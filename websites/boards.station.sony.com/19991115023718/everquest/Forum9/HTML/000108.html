</FONT><HR>It has come to my attention from reading many of the messages on this board is the fact that, in general, wizards are considered in the majority by other classes to be kill stealers.  As a wizard i find this a rather irritating viewpoint as i and others have tried very hard to fight fairly and not steal kills.  Granted that i am no level 50 wizard, but in my travels i have only come across 1, maybe 2, true kill stealing wizards.  One of the only reasons i can come up with for this invalid assesment is that because we do so much damage and posess the ability to easily steal kills from even higher level PCs it is automatically assumed that we would.  This is not true for many of us.  The only other reason i can come up with is based on another valid mistake.  Because we have low HP and little melee skills it is important that we use a good deal of strategy to do as much damage before we actually come into contact with are targetand are forced to fight in close quarters.  Because of this we try to attack from the greatest possible distance thus allowing us to do a great deal of damage while the target is running toward us.  Unfortunately for some reason, monsters are visible at much longer distances that PCs.  So often if we see something in the distance that we would like to attack we stay well out of range and fire.  Because our spells do so much damage we usually kill whatever we aim at before the misunderstanding can be cleared up.  This is, in my experience the most valid argument that has led up to the misconseption that the majority of wizards are kill stealers.  Whether you agree or disagree with this i suggest that you post your view on the matter here as i would like to know what people think and where this whole thing came from.  <P>Mithros, of the Tunare server<BR>Currently on level 13</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Mithros,<BR>  I have traveled through many zones in my 13 seasons.  In some places, I have found wizards who are willing to take turns at spawns (i.e., Derv camps in North Ro).  Many spawns, and the wizard needs to regain mana.  Same thing at the Nybright camp in Lesser Fay.  However, as a ranger, I can USE the shiny brass shield that is dropped by the Orc Trainer in Crushbone.  He is a semi-rare spawn (5-10 centurions spawn before him).  He only has the shield once every 4 or 5 times out.  I spent the vast majority of my playing time for a 2 week period killing the centurions on Trainer Hill, while waiting for the Trainer to come out so I could get a shot at the shield.  What happens, is as soon as he appears, so do the wizards.  They've been sitting invisible, watching me (and the other melee classes) kill the Centurions without lending a hand (okay, a finger wave when we're in trouble).  The wizards immediately start nuking the Trainer and kill him.  When he has the shield, they offer to sell it to us for 20-30plat.  That is total bull***t.  I can kill him, I don't need the wizard to do it for me.  You see the same thing at every location where an item is dropped that has some value.<BR>   Good strategy?  Sit invisible, watching other classes take on the beasts so you can get the rare spawn.  That's not strategy. Since you're invisible, the other spawns can't see you, so they go after the other classes.  If I could have done it without dying, I would have left the other Orcs alone until the Trainer came out.  Then when the kill-stealers appeared, maybe the Orcs would have killed them instead.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way.  Am I still in Crushbone?  No.  I'm back in North Ro.  The derv camps have more spawns with items almost as good as the SBS (money wise).  Do I have a SBS?  No.  I didn't have the money to pay for something I'm capable of getting on my own (fletching is expensive).  I probably won't go back to Crushbone until I can take out Dvinn.  I already have a dagger, but I want to get one on my own.  He's being "farmed" for the dirk.  But as far as I know, they don't have the kill-stealing problem there.

</FONT><HR>Sounds like you've legitimately been getting cheated.  While i dont personally kill steal, and i haven't seen many that do and certainly not in the numbers that you're talking about, i can see that some wizards might be tempted to the dark side of kill stealing.  I personally usually only hunt things that carry objects i dont use if i'm in need of money but usually its for the exp.  Since it sounds like this rogue group of wizards are there killing everything big every time and not sharing any of the important kills (by the way correct me if i'm wrong because this wouldn't apply otherwise) i suggest you group with some casters yourself and go to get this item because there really is no other way to compete with a group of wizard kill stealers and i say all is fair when dealing with them.  However if they aren't doing this just to be mean which is a good possibility (i'm not there so i cant say) take into account the fact that large numbers of battles drain mana and often we wizards dont like to waste mana on low level things because often we end up meditating when we really need to fight something big.  Therefore staying invisible is a good way to avoid wasting unneccesary mana on a lot of pointless battles.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ragnorok,<BR> I don't know what server you play on, but go visit Crushbone.  I currently play on Erollisi Marr.  I have lvl 10 rangers on 2 other servers, and moved twice to stay with friends.  I saw the same thing in Crushbone on those other servers.  As far as fighting the Trainer for the XP -- wrong.  At lvl 11-13, the Trainer conned from Blue to Yellow to me.  The Centurions up there also conned the same, and the legionaires around the hill were red.  The wizards weren't sitting invisible to regain mana for the next fight with the BIG BAD ORC, they were sitting invisible so they wouldn't get beat on by the Centurions while waiting for the Trainer to spawn.<BR>  I also have a lvl 8 enchanter that I alternate my time with, and have never stolen a kill with him -- except when someone has asked for help.  At that point, it's no longer that person's MOB.  My enchanter regains about 200 mana points in just under 5 minutes. I've timed it after enchanting silver at 80mana a shot.  The Trainer spawns about every 15 minutes real time.  You do the math.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>There are actually 3 seperate issues here:<P>1.  Is it immoral for a caster to sit at a spawn point invisible, waiting on the MOB to show up, letting others kill things in which he's not interested?  I can see both sides of the coin here.  He's camping, just like everyone else...he's just not killing stuff in which he's not interested.  Using the spells at your disposal is certainly valid.  If you don't like this...you're a ranger.  You should have Hide. &lt;shrug&gt;<P>2.  What about camping stuff solely for loot?  I'd love to see Verant implement a feature such that you only get loot from stuff from which you also get exp.  Or maybe only apply that to good loot.  (Hey...if I can't get batwings, it'll seriously hurt my attempts to enhance my culinary talents).<P>3.  Casters can, and do, kill-steal from non-casters.  Wizards get the reputation for that because, realistically, that's what Verant designed us for.  This tends to be the worst at camps.  Crushbone and Highpass are, off the top of my head, the worst places in the game for this.<P>Issue 3 is really the big one this thread is revolving around.  What can be done about it?<P>1.  Nerf the wizard class even further.  We have the most limited spell selection in the game.  Worst hit points, worst combat tables.  In exchange for this, at the highest levels, our damage spells are about 20% better than a magician's.  It'd be hard to make the class any less powerful and more useless to a group (which is what matters) without just totally deleting them.<P>2.  Change the exp/loot system.  Note:  going to a cumulative group thing will not help.  If I want to KS, under those rules, I can easily find 3-4 anti-social bastards who would be happy to group up and help.  In which case, the same problem exists.<P>3.  If you want an item that's heavily camped, just buy it, and then go enjoy playing the game.  If you don't enjoy camping and competing for kills, then don't.  There are lots of places which aren't camped.  Admittedly, the loot is not as good.  But the Fun is a lot better.<P>Barnabas<BR>The Great Wizzard<BR>Prexus<P>p.s. The standard disclaimer:  I've never stolen a kill yet, and I've never been to Crushbone at all.  Although I'm considering wandering over to get a Dragoon dirk.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>If you're into slinging mud about kill-stealing, I can cite more than a small number of examples of sword-slingers who are clearly guilty of stealing from the wizards, by disregarding the signs of the rooting spell, and rush over to attack something anyway (I don't cast unless no one is running at something, and if they start, I just back up a bit and stop the casting.), or better yet, wait until the wizard has just lobbed the first two fire bolts at the bear or lion, and then rush over to try to take it.<P>The complaining about kill-stealing as if wizards are the only people who do it is just as lame as the actual kill stealing.  The only reason wizards stand out in people's minds is the special effects draw attention to it when it occurs.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I'm a monk who hunts in befallen and oasis.. the oasis isn't that bad, kill stealing only happens when my group and I are killing lockjaw or some aqua goblin pets.. we bash on it until we are half dead and it its barely alive, then NUKE.  for some strange reason, sometimes we still get to loot the thing sometimes we don't.. I don't get how kill stealing works, but It is awfully annoying trying to kill a 20+ monster at 17 and then having the exp taken away..  Befallen must be one of the worst places in the game to hunt.. 3 very highly sought after items are there... the BBC, the ring, and the "plates" people sit there and camp all day getting these items.  well, that's okay.. but once my group and I spent 40 minutes waiting for the shadowknight that had the key...when it popped up, NUKE.  there went the sk and the armplates and the key.. the wizard disappeared.. then after like 20 minutes, we get the key, go down the dungeon, and what do you know.. the wizard is at the fourth shadowknight camping.. I'm sorry sir.. I accidently trained the ENTIRE befallen dungeon with SOW into you and fainted out of fear &lt;darn&gt; don't you wish that wouldn't happen so often?  hehehe...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

You attack it and take off 40 percent of it's life,then nukes start flying out of the air and kill it. That is one thing. But if someone happens along, and happens to engage it before you, and kills it, why can you be upset? i mean it was never your to begin with...<P>Just dont make sense to me how some people think this way.<P>Wizard - the Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>"But if someone happens along, and happens to engage it before you..."<P>Ok, hrmm, it's my feeling that people rarely just happen by.  I mean, is this like, "Oh, look there's 6 people in that room and, look there, it's &lt;insert high profile name here&gt;, well, I'll just hit it before anyone can react."?<P>I've gone into dungeons just to get items at times (in my case, for personal use, not to farm something to sell the items).  Sometimes there's been people already at these spawn spots.  Sometimes the people are nice and willing to share, and I take a turn in the rotation of the spawn.  As I usually don't get exp at these places, and often have more than enough mana, I'll pitch in if someone's in trouble, and once I get what I want, I'm gone.<P>Othertimes, I've gotten a response like "well, there's 2 spawn and 2 groups, there's no room for you".  I just don't buy this, I see this type of attitude as selfish, and though I'm capable of ks'ing every spawn that appears, I won't.  I've not had to ks yet, most people can be reasoned with, though I have had groups move in on my spawn spots and take every spawn, not even willing to share.  Kill stealing isn't only reserved for individuals - groups are also guilty of it.<P>-Beltath, magician, Solusek Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Well then you are the rare exception to the rule.<P>Hey, I'm a wizard and I'm 21st level and I never kill steal either... it's the mages that do all the kill stealing!<P>Heh.. let me tell you about my solution to kill stealing lol...<P>HAH.. that's funny lets give those Wizards and Mages what they deserve!<P>Well if Wizards got more HP and AC then we wouldn't have to steal.<P>Oh sure, now you want to have the GOD race!<P>I think you're all wrong and I'll tell you why Wizards need to be eliminated from this game.<P>Hey, how can mages be bigger kill stealers when we cant invis without our pet killing itself?

I have only encountered 1 honest to goodness kill stealer, and I promptly took care of him when I knew he was in the area! How? I cast see invis and followed him all around the zone... not attacking anything or trying to kill him... just shadowing him and pointing him out to all the others... by the time I was done, everyone in the zone had See Invis cast on them.. he got fed up and left and there was rejoicing by all.<P>Anyway, just my two cents... and that's probably all it's worth.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>My experience with "kill stealing wizards."<P>Once, it happened.  I am a tenth level bard, and at the time I was ninth level.  I was in North Ro with one friend, and we were working out with the dervishes.  At the time, one fight would knock me down, and I'd have to rest for a while to get back up.  I grabbed one derv, pulled him up to our spot on the dune, and worked him down a little, going down to one bubble in the process.  I pulled back a little to let my buddy take a couple of whacks, when kah-blammo! from out of nowhere some wizard fires some ball of fire or something.  The derv, quite understandably, turns around and runs down into the camp.  I give chase, and catch up to him, with one bubble of life, and smack him a good one.  At this time, the next derv pops up, and hits me as the first one goes down.  I back back up, near death and not able to run... and ask where the freaking wizard went, hoping hoping that this one would get blasted too.  <P>Nope.  <P>I died.<P>I wasn't angry about the blasting of the first one.  I was a lot disappointed that the wizard wasn't willing to stick around and help with the second dervish.  It was a matter of ... why was this wizard so much more willing to help with the almost dead one, but when the fighting person is almost dead, the wizard is gone?  Solo tactics.  <P>Sure, tactics - someone (above) said that it's not tactics to sit invisible on a field and wait for the trainer to show up.  I disagree- it's not neighborly, but it's tactics.  Sun Tzu would have done it... well, maybe.  Depends on your notions of honor, I guess.  I think it's like hiding in shadows and backstabbing.  Not paladin-honorable tactics, but appropriate to the class.  <P>Rustifer<BR>Bard, tenth song<BR>Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Definitely sounds "not neighborly," and, at a camp in N Ro, probably wasn't.  Just for the sake of argument, what if it went like this?<P>Caster's bopping his happy self across the zone, enjoying his Invisibility spell. Sees a fight.  Clicks the combatatants.  Looks like the bard's getting smacked...drop a little nuke on the MOB, whittle it down some, push the odds over to the bard's favor, go back Invis, and keep going wherever he's heading.<P>Unlikely, yes.  But I can definitely say that I've done exactly this on a few occasions (very hard to do without taking the kill, but it is possible).  Not many.  And I generally would stick around to see the results.  Depends on how much of a hurry I'm in.<P>So...maybe he was being a tad neighborly, he just did it badly.<P>Barnabas<BR>The Great Wizzard<BR>Prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I'm still trying to decide if a grouped magician's pet gets damage from one of my area effect songs (chords of dissonance).  It doesn't get Selo's Accelerando, and I don't think either of my group combat helpers help them, so maybe the area effect damage damages it (is a pet a group member, a monster, or a neutral, is the question)<P>Rustifer<BR>Tenth Song (Hurray for Anthem de Arms!)<BR>Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Wizards are not the most likely to steal kills. I was with a friend, he is a lvl 25 wizard and Im a lvl 27 wizard. We had a lvl 23 enchanter come up where we were at and said he bet he could take the next kill. We didnt believe him so we gave it a try. Guess what, he got the kill. We blasted it and he charmed it. Then he got the next hit when charm was gone and got the exp.

</FONT><HR>That sounds like a bug to me.  I cant see how that could possibly be legal.  That means that an enchanter could take a kill using half a bubble of mana that would take a two bubbles of mana from any other caster at least.  You should ask a GM if that is how it should be since the enchanter only did a little bit of the total damage and certainly not more than half.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Not a bug, it's a fairly common tactic. He charms the MOB, it's his pet.  In -PvP situations, no other player can hurt it. Odds are, their mana is gone before charm wears off, so he can deal with it at his leisure.<P>Enchanters are extremely powerful. Their wide diversity of spells allows them to approach problems in extremely creative ways. And GZ likes them.<P>They're an extremely subtle class, so most players don't understand them at all (I certainly don't).<P>Yes, they are better in most situations than any other INT-based caster. They are better KS'ers than wizards.  They just have so many other options that it's more efficient for them to be sociable and have fun.<P>Barnabas<BR>The Great Wizzard<BR>Prexus<P>p.s.

But this raw count does not take into account that Magicians get 4 spells that are essencially the same spell every level.  <P>Yeah, the elementals are different, but they are one spell: summon Elemental Du Jour.
