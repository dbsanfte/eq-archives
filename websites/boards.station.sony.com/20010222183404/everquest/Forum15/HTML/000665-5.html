</FONT><HR>ITEM: Buff Capacity<P>DESCRIPTION: Of late I'm increasingly experiencing the "no room for bard songs" syndrome. In a decent group, with all the different spells and effects that now stack, that 16 buff limit is far more easily attainable. With all the new spells being added via Velious, this is going to become an increased problem, and is /becoming/ quite a significant /balance/ factor for bards of 40+. People go for the static buffs and then find they don't need anyone to provide 9s duration ones. i.e. no bard required.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>HOLY CRUD<P>For the first time in a long time i was grouped with a necro last night - I was running a level 23 warrior not my bard so this isn't about mana battery stuff.<P>What it is about is Screaming Terror.<P>This is NOT a call to nerf screaming terror but crap .. were necros so weak they had to have a crowd control/mes spell that was SO much better than Pixie Strike?<P>I don't know what they have at higher levels but in the mid-20's that spell was at least 3x as effective as PS in terms of sticking, duration and IT HAS A MEMORY BLUR.  Pixie has Bupkiss.<P>I was asking a friend of mine who has a high level necro what she thought of it and she said 'it isn't that great .. the blur doesn't always work'<P>Now that is a player that my bard grouped with for 15 levels (she was playing a paladin at the time and we went from around 20 to 35 together) - somehow she never noticed I had to work my ass off to keep things off us in Sol A - Fighting, spinning around, charming, recharming, fighting, buffing etc. while her necro can hold at 3 mob pull while her skeleton and dots do the job one at a time.<P>Are we supposed to do Crowd Control or not? Are we the weaker but at least adequate stand-in for an enchanter or not?<P>make a decision - the changes in this patch had one thing of value - the snare song was busted!<P>This is nice - now check out FEAR, CHARM, MES, and LULLABYE - please .. if you want us to do CC we need those spells to work at least twices as well.<P>Otherwise i'm better off singing the damn mana song so the necro can do crowd control.<P>and I see only the defense skill was raised for bards, not dodge - nor parry ... oh well<P>I'm so weary of this and so very glad i have other things to do with my time and money when Bards don't get put right (as it seems to be will be the case).<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I have a bone to pick with you bud.<P>Over the last few weeks you've been going around talking about how this class shouldn't receive this ability because it's something that define's part of that classes abilities.<P>If you truly believe that, your in for a big dissapointment, Alan.<P>Bard's are a conglomerate in some way of every class.  We have song's that make us capable of healing, similar to clerics, druids, shamans, rangers, paladins, and in a small way necromancers.  We have song's that increase resist's, AC, strength, haste (although it sucks extremely bad), dexterity, agility, mana restoration, dot's, slows, snares, charms, mesmerize, direct damage ... the list goes on ...<P>These aren't unique abilities to our class.  Their a fairly unique implementation of them, but they are abilities gained from other classes.<P>So I'm just curious, if we've received thing's that are signature abilities in other classes, that you see in no other class aside from bard and that one other class, why is it NOT ok to receive a few more traits that another class has?  Or for other classes to receive it?<P>On the one hand bard's are not unique because everything we can do is done by other class, in a majority of cases is done better, but on the other hand we're not allowed gain anymore abilities because that would infringe on other classes unique abilities ... yaaaa, riiight ...<P>I just fail to see how you can stand there and give druids and shamans better heals, newer and better abilities to other hybrids which are still considered pretty usefull in the post 50 game ... but all bards are getting is better defense, and a song that only helps lower level bards?<P>I'm almost always in a group with a warrior, so if I'm getting aggroed, the crap has already hit the fan, or else I don't stay aggroed long ... yes, of course we want better AC ... but what's unbalancing us hasn't even been broached yet.  A new mana song doesn't balance us.  Higher ac doesn't balance us.  Fixing our bugged songs helps us, making our songs more group friendly helps us, giving people a reason better than mana song to want us around helps us, making our songs usefull in post 50 encounters by at least allowing our songs to land on stuff (ie., lowering resistance ... if we have to keep the effect up the entire time by twisting it, it should go without saying that the resist's shouldn't be so high).<P>Please try to take a more than askance glance at the bardic class and do more than throw us a bone.  So far I see two improvements which are mildly usefull to high level bards, and one improvement to low level bards.  The change to desperate dirge isn't usefull to me or any other bard ... our complaint wasn't the amount of damage it dealt, it was how much it resist's and the amount of mana it cost's us.  Granted there will probably be more improvements to the bard class in the future, but I don't want to see more of these 'bards are warriors that sing' trends, I'd like to see some bug fixes, and some actual enhancements that will make us more usefull.<P>-Desbarolis -- 47th bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Dyfrin,<BR>	You said -<P>**People ask that melee skills go up so total damage output increases. Do bards need that?<BR>Not really, with just sionaches and evensong I'm doing just fine, about where I should be.. part melee. If we want to be more melee orientated(monk/rogue like) we would lose some other things, useful or not.. but still lose out on some abilities. <P>&lt;&lt;Many people who play Bards see them in the same light as other Hybrids.  Not all of us are asking that.  Some of us are only asking that the relative damage rate of all of our usable abilities is on par with another Hybrid.  See my previous post.  I strongly disagree with you assertion that Bards damage rate is level appropriate in comparison to any Fighter.&gt;&gt;<P>**People ask that our damage overall and songs be increased at the same curve as other classes. Aye we should, as long as we keep the same proportion as was maintained prior 50, there should be no problem increasing mana regen, hp regen, haste %, stat buff, resist buff, melee damage, hp, etc. <P>&lt;&lt;Once again, this is not solely a level 50 issue.  It simply becomes impossible to miss after level 50.  Bard songs begin to fall behind the effectiveness of casters spells the level after they are gained.  The power curve of Bard songs is flat.  Even a low level casters spell becomes more efficient as there manna pool increases.&gt;&gt;<P>**AC/HP is low say many. The "plate" armor has low ac(odd melodic bp has 42.. yet gloves are less than SS? Seems fishy) for plate, and our HP rivals casters. I often group with a 54th wizard, and it is truely sad when she self buffs, her hp is 58 lower than mine. 3 level difference there. I would have thought a wizard of all things to have less hp than a bard up to 10 levels ahead of the bard. <P>&lt;&lt;If  the role of a Bard is part Defensive then our melee survival rate needs to be improved.  If not, or offense, or crowd control, or healing needs to be improved.  I have never heard “Oh, we have a Bard we don’t need a &lt;insert any class here&gt;”.  Currently Bards are the “I guess we have an extra space class”.  I don’t ask that we become better than any other class at anything.  I don’t even ask that we be as good.  I do ask that Bards work as an effective replacement for at least 3 other classes.  Jack of all trades, remember!&gt;&gt;<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Quote:<BR>sirnari thats what think and action wise a song would 2 think about it a lullaby mez ing you wouldnt you be able to backstab them then!<P>Ah, well that's my point... backstab wouldn't be an across the board damage increase...it would take skill to be able to use it while handling the normal bard role. When I'm mezzing singles (or sometimes double adds), I'm still often engaged in melee as well (space permitting...and assuming that I don't get resisted [haha])... Mezz pulse.../assist...haste pulse...snare pulse...BoH pulse...then back out quickly and mezz pulse again.<P>  I'm not rampantly advocating backstab as an enhance, but it would go some way to increasing the detrement that bards labour under damage wise; Sure we can DoT, but VI increases in AOE DoTs rather than melee output will make soloing more 'profitable', while VI are at the same time trying to encourage grouping. The best solution would seem to be low-capped backstab or low-capped duel weild. Alternatives would be enhanced single target DD or better weapons...both rather short-sighted IMHO.<P>Siranui<BR>&lt;Tides of Destiny&gt;<BR>Torv  <P><BR> <BR>Buyucu<BR>Station Member   posted 02-21-2001 04:53 AM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>SIRANUI-ToD<BR>Carpal Tunnel is a repetitive stress injury.

I am not seriously concerned about the risk of EQ giving me RSI. If anyone is seriously concerned about bard-induced RSI, then don't play one. Yeah, maybe I'm stubborn, insensitive and proud of my bardic skills... to my mind 'autotwisting' any further than is currently possible with macros would in many ways de-skill the bard class... I don't want that, despite the hastle that twisting brings. With the current macro set-ups available, bard twisting requires not much more effort than a tank's use of taunt, kick etc.<P><BR>Necro mezzing: Yes, it is better than ours. Sucky, ain't it?<BR>It really annoys me to be hear 'no, we don't want you to do CC...bard mezzing is ghetto...we'd rather root park or get the necro to do it.'<P><BR>I'm really annoyed with today's bardic patch implementations. I'm getting the feeling that none of our informed input is going to change what VI have decided, and what VI has decided doesn't have much to do with the major issues raised.<P><BR>Siranui<BR>&lt;ToD&gt;<BR>Torv<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A very nice list that gets most of the bugs and issues.  Just 1 comment on the list items:-<P>a) Mana Costs - It's already been suggested and possibly even agreed that a better solution for Denon's Desperate Dirge is to put it on a timer rather than a large mana cost.  Even with that and the patch upgrade in damage I don't see it being used much, but it's still a decent solution.<BR>The lvl39 charm song is then left as the only mana song; there's an easy way to remove the mana cost while making it much less useful for soloing - just reduce the casting range by &gt;alot&lt;.  This is a balance issue in some ways as at medium levels bards charm at least as well as enchanters.  The positive adjustment I would like to see is removing the hard level cap on this song.<P><BR>Also please consider adding the following:-<P>1) Crowd Control - The suggestion that bards could play a more useful role in crowd control made the enchanter list but not the bard list - it should probably be added here.  In truth we do not need much but my suggestion is:-<BR>a) removing level caps on charm and mez.<BR>b) adding an upgraded area-effect mez song (Kelin's Illustrious Lullaby?) that has a fairly high resist rate, say 25% on a white with standard magic resist +/-5% per level difference and adjusted for CHA and MR.<BR>c) adding a limited memory blur song; several options here that do not tread on chanters' toes. Perhaps targetting a party member and lowering their hate on the nearest mob; perhaps targetting a mob and lowering the hate of the most hated foe.  In either case something that has a chance to pull a mob off a caster (particularly clerics with the patch :-) ) but falling way short of a full targetted blur. <P><BR>2) Melee Skills - most bards feel their melee skills need looking into in some way.  I'm not asking for an increase with no decrease but perhaps thinking about how the skills currently work would be appropriate.  Myself I would take riposte away from bards completely (we're less warrior than other hybrids) while giving a small boost to parry and dodge; I'd even suggest lowering our defense a little again (I don't believe we're as good as warriors).  Whatever the final breakdown of these skills an examination of them should be on the list.<P><BR>3) High-Level Song Effectiveness - The issues of post-50 song damage and haste/slow stacking are really special cases of the general problem that has been posted over and over of bards feeling without a good role in balanced high level groups.  It's fine to leave these 2 on the list for emphasis but please also add a more general revision of high-level bards and their roles.  It is likely that if the crowd control issue, the haste/slow stacking problem and the damage curve issues are all addressed we will feel useful again but if these are found to be impossible or impinging on other classes' areas (or any other perfectly valid reason) then the general problem will still remain and perhaps some of the many alternative ideas people have had would need further consideration.<P>That's it for now - I was very disappointed in the patch (I play a bard and enchanter, my partner a cleric) which didn't seem to address the concerns I have seen raised but I hope that is because the bigger concerns are bigger problems taking more time to solve.  My feeling is that you will address the issues in time as you have for the most part in recent times.  I'm worried that you will bow to the "bigger voices, more pressure" syndrome where the less popular classes' issues take lesser weight.  We've seen a &gt;big&lt; increase in druid power in this last patch, the most popular class, please do not forget about us.<P>                (-:   Zel   :-)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well i really cant believe the items which were addressed in this patch in relation to bards.<P>I play a lvl60 bard on Prexus...I also play a 54 druid, and a 51 cleric, and a few other lvl 30ish characters...<P>no bard ever has desperate dirge memmed...it is 100% USELESS song....It will never be used in an "emergency" because it is never memmed and also because IT DAMAGES THE BARD TOO! add to this the fact that it takes a bard about an hour to regain the mana it uses if they are meditating...meaning, an hour+ of sitting ..= not contributing to the grp..<P>the only use i can see for this song is in an AoE grp..and even then , the insane limitations placed upon it make it a total waste of a spell slot...nuff said...im appalled that VI thinks this song matters to bards...it shows to me that no one  there plays a bard or they would know how utterly worthless this song is.<P>~ another clarity song????? why? <P>~ higher defenses???? why?...my 60 bard never gets hit...if you want me to be a tank...then address our low damage output and low HP issues. Higher defenses are totally useless if your damage output thru song and melee are laughable<P>~ bard dots?....resists to these songs are so insanely high (even with planes , dragon instruments equipped) that they are NEVER memmed...<P>~ bard DD songs...boa****l bellow is a joke 50+ if the song scaled properly it might be a different story<P>~ charm and mezz caps...at lvl 60 a bard really cant mezz or charm anything in a raid situation...i dont think we should be as powerful as enchanters in this realm...but i do think we already have plenty of limitations on our abilities (duration, resists) that the lvl caps are extremely unwarranted<P>~ the ervaj line...what can i say but you've got to be kidding me! again , i have to assume that nobody at verant has ever played a bard, and they are unwilling to listen to the people that do. At the level we get these songs...everyone is hasted to the max % already....and even if they were not...there is no grp configuration that would benefit from a miniscule haste % increase which forces a bard to use an instrument over weapons<BR>Also, the particle effects on these songs is ridiculous...talk about lag production...basically 2 more songs that will never be memmed<P>~ the whole "jack of all trades" thing may work at levels 1 thru 30....but above that...we just have a whole bunch of utterly useless skills<P>this may be long winded...but i regurly talk to a lot of the higher lvl bards on my server...we all share a lot of the same opinions regarding these issues...why arent you listening to us?...<P>this is not a flame...this is just me asking why my character basically only exists to pump mana to  my group...ask yourself why there are so few bards that ever push the character to 60...<P>for goodness sake...look at the extensive testing done by Thott, the guy is doing all your work for you...take the data and act on it...<P>and fix the bugs please...you've been saying you would for such a long time.<P>ps...gorenaire isnt dropping scales...hahahah...lets all start rogues so we can  see how an epic weapon feels in our hand.<P>another frustrated bard...."whats that you say?...play manasong?..../sigh...here goes"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok... Bard songs could not affect player pets. Now it's fair that no other spell except those casted by pet's master should affect them as well... This is a balance issue... Not because it's easier to implement that single target spells affect pets. Bards songs already have lower effects than similar spells casted by other classes, but being unable to affect pets is even more limitating. Why? </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>wow- no wonder I don't enjoy my bard! I'm mostly a Ranger, and have a similar feeling regarding the "extra-slot" role in a party. I would think that Bards could get some better defensive stuff- maybe more along the lines of cool disciplines, not extra HP or AC. Like some sort of weapons display? Like a performance- spinning blades with an auto-riposte affect?  I always thought Bards should be masters of Taunting, too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ignore the trolling. Any bards who are as disgusted as I am with the bard issues (or lack of) addressed by the latest patch, please post your discontent. Reasoned arguement is obviously ignored, all we have left is complaint. Better still, vote with your feet & quit!<P>*Maybe* some of the bard problems raised will be addressed in a future patch, but, once again, the bards are left to last (probably to be overlooked yet again).<P>1) Increased defense cap.<BR>   Great for the lower level bards who have such a high aggro. Congratulations on this benefit, I don't begrudge you. From the point of view of a level 55 bard though, it's useless. I find it impossible to even generate any aggro at this level - I wish I could.<P>2) Level 20 bard song.<BR>   Time for politeness is at at an end. This is a bloody stupid move! OK, it's an easter egg for bards in their 20's (who don't really need it), but at the cost of upsetting the already-favoured enchanters even more. Next thing we will see is the level 20 mana song being nerfed or an enchanter spell introduced that makes it redundant. I suspect that this this was actually a move to reduce the number of bards soloing at this level, enticing them back into groups. <P>3) Denon's Desparate Dirge<BR>   Well, what can I say? The problem ISN'T the amount of damage, it's the fact that most bards can only sing it once per full mana bar, giving it a ridiculous re-cast time as the bard med skill is capped at *one*. It's redundant, it's useless.<P>This patch is truly pathetic for bards, given the improvements introduced for other classes. It's an insult.<P>Finally, those of you who don't like the post, troll all you like. I won't be visiting this board again. Playing text-only muds is more fun than playing the redundant EQ Troubador.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>boodigger (and several other bards): dirge is a targeted ae, which *can* include the bard. You just have to stand back a little to use it.<P>It's not true that no bard ever has it memmed, they use it for about 2-3 levels before more important songs come along. Certainly after 50 almost no bard will ever use it.<P>However; the reason isn't JUST the ineffectiveness of the song, it's to do with the fact that post 50 very few people are willing to use AoEs because they mess with crowd control.<P>K</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Actually my main is a MONK, but you were oh so close. <P>I posted because I'm tired of hearing what bards are getting, so yes I exaggerated. <P>I'm tired of seeing items that are for WAR,PAL, and BRD, I'm tired of hearing about new songs added for bards that mimic another classes specialties. I'm annoyed that pure classes keep getting nothing more while the hybrids take places equal to pure classes in offensive, and defensive skills. <P>I also play a SK (again note, how close you were with your assumption that I am an enchanter), and I don't think that some of the things given to that class are fair to warriors (note: I don't play a warrior, so you can hold off on a second oh so accurate guess on what classes I play). <P>Was the sarcasm, and exaggeration necessary? Probably not, but nothing else seems to draw any attention... and I suppose I should have realized who would jump on my previous post as literal(because having Illusion: Werewolf at 12th just SOUNDS so literal).<P>So I bow to your obviously superior powers of observation... and give you one more tidbit, that being I don't even have a -1st- level enchanter, but I'm sure it was just the song special effects that got in your eyes. <P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>maybe if i mention this idea often enough someone will at least tell me it stinks<P>ok it is acknowledged that there are stacking problems with Bardic haste songs and that most folks are at the fully haste limit once they hit the big time levels anyway and get various other buffs and items on them.<P>What does haste do anyway? it increases the number of attacks and hence is indirect damage the bard can do.<P>Currently a bard can do indirect damage via damage shielding and via hasting.<P>But with stacking and possibly more importantly hast limit issues one of those channels is not really viable.<P>I propose a set of 3-4 songs which would scale with level, be sung rather than played on an instrument and would provide a damage enchancement ability - a Damage Sword rather than Damage Shield if you will.<P>The 3-4 songs would be to allow a fire-based, ice-based or magic based option (if you wanted to make the songs resistable unlike a damage shield - i would suggest strongly that this song not be resistable so that it would be of use on raids and in velious) and would add from 5-10 points of damage (off the top of my head) to each successful melee attack as well as a modest boost to a corresponding resistance.<P>if a baseline melee attack does 50 points of damage (which at higher levels i'm sure is a low estimate) then a 20% haste is in effect generating 20% or 10 more points of damage over time.<P>this song would have roughly the same effect - it wouldn't be as strong as a 20% haste because it wouldn't improve the chances of a proc for instance or increase the number of critical hits etc.<P>But it would be damage that the bard could contribute to the party without diminishing the value of the other buffers and hasters or having any stacking issues.<P>If a bard were twisting this and a group damage shield while meleeing the overall contribution of damage would be rather high certainly those two songs would be worth a lot more damage than the bard him/herself can do directly.<P>that would leave one twist for something useful like a resist or ST/DEX buff or whatever for melee situations.  Alternatively in the abscence of haste buffs a haste/sword/shield song would be of considerable benefit to the party melee.<P>I think these songs could be filtered at around level 35 (if you go with a single version of the song unresistable and unenhanceable by element type) or every 5 levels starting at 35 with each song adding some damage or effect based on element.<P>Me, I think a 35 damage sword song - unresistable, with hate dealt with like a damage shield starting at 5 and going up to 10-15 (and i like the information on 55+ damage to even guess at the cap) would be a really nice addition to the bardic arsenal.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000665-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000665.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000665-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000665-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000665-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000665&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000665&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
