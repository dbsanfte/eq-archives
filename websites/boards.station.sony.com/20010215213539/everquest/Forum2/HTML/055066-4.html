</FONT><HR>Its hard to add to what people have already written here.  While Grimstaff and I have disagreed on amy things over the years, starting back on the old Graffe board, I think his post pretty much sums up the current issues.<P>Unfortunately I think Wizards suffer from something no one can do anything about.  The fact is, we are the only class that only does damage when we have mana.  Because of balance issues, mana is a closely guarded resource by Varent.  Increasing mana supply across the board would change everything immensely.  Add to this that Wizards are only damage dealers, and you end up with wizards being useless when they are out of mana, which is almost all the time at high levels.<P>There is no debating that that amount of damage we can contribute to a night of fighting has become much less than all the other damage dealing classes, mostly because of the lack of mana.  The efficiency of other damage dealing classes (like warriors, rangers, rogues, etc) are very good because mana from support classes gets turned into HP at a very good ratio.  Thus a single cleric supporting a warrior will yield far more damage per hour than the mana spent supporting a wizard.  Not to mention that there are few ways to feed mana to wizards.<P>So..<P>1. Wizards are a pure damage dealing class<BR>2. We render far less damage in a night than other damage dealing classes.<BR>3. The mana to HP spells are very efficient, and the HP to damage ratio (from fighters and pets) is far more efficient than pure mana to damage ratios (wizards).<BR>4. While this was more balanced before the level 50 expansion, even back then we were on the bottom of the spectrum.<BR>5. Ergo, wizards are not very useful at high levels.<P>I have read how wizards are multi-dimensional, and a well played wizard can still be a help if played well in certain situations.  But we can no longer do enough damage in a short amount of time to make much difference to fights.  We also cannot do enough damage over a long period of time for a class whose only skill is damage dealing.  Thus, we become second class citizens.<P>Someone spoke well above... if you moved a couple of ports to druids, you could delete the wizard class and there would be no effect in the gameplay of Everquest.  That cannot be said of any other class, and it is a sad thing.<P>I started my wizard on the day Innoruuk opened and have held my account ever since.  Most of the wizards I have known for years are now gone or retired.  It is a sad thing.  One by one I have seen them disappear from the "/who wizard x y all" list.  I have other classes and I play them for fun, but the one I am most attached to is Dilvish.  My many friends make it easy on me and I am welcome in any endevor we try, but I know deep down inside that it is their love for Dilvish that matters, not my contributions to battles.<P>Now to the crux, my recommendation.<P>I think the spells we have are great in their damage dealing variety.  The lures, draughts and 3 kinds of damage spells (magic, fire and ice) are also very good.  The only thing that stops us from consistantly doing damage is our (total mana) * (dmg ratio) * (mana regen).  There are two solutions, but only one which can be made and not effect the balance.  The first one would be to increase our mana, or our mana regen by a huge number in high levels.  This I think would probably be unbalancing, as it would allow us the ability to do too much damage too quickly and would turn soloing wizards into power leveling machines and break balance.<P>The second solution, and the only one which makes sense, so to add two new sets of spells, one at 50 and one at 55.  <P>1. These spells would cover the usual fire, ice and magic ranges.<BR>2. The set at 55 would be lure type spells.<BR>3. They would have fairly long casts, but not too long.<BR>4. They would do medium damage, nothing stellar<BR>5. They would cost VERY little mana. So little mana that we could consistantly fight all night.<BR>6. They would be designed so we would do damage similar to warriors over the same time period.  We are, after all, the magic version of warriors.<BR>7. So the casting time, damage, lure qualities and mana usage would need to be balanced to provide this consistant damage.<P>This would solve the issues of wizards without making us more powerful soloers.  You can't solo with that type of spell. You need to make the spells be root breakers 100 percent of the time, and add a special effect to the spell that is added to a buff on the mob which stops them from being rootable. Then make the cast time long enough that a bonded mob will reach you before you can cast it.  So if you were soloing and you used one of these spells, the mob would be unrootable (for some time), and since the time it takes to cast the spells is too long, the mob will reach you before you can re-cast.  Thus the spells could not be used for soloing.  But in groups and large battles we could consistantly use the spells throughout the night, doing equivelent damage as warriors (but slightly less to adjust for that fact that warriors are having their life artifically extended via healing).<P>If they make this one change, wziards will become viable again.  But please note this... these spells must require an extremely small amount of mana for this to rebalance wizards. I am not talking a 5 percent increase in effiency, but a huge jump in efficiency.<P>Dilvish Ehldar<BR>Invitorum, Innoruuk<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>WHOOO !!!  Dilvish that's what I've been saying about mana efficiency all this time...if they increase our mana efficiency 105% it STILL might not even be enuff.  5% would be a cruel joke heh  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P><BR>However, I still believe there has to be a "need" for wizards.  Other than dmging spells....otherwise, just get a mage pet and mage....there's your continuous dmg, and a BIG dmg absorber so the cleric has more heals for the PC tanks.  (Notice, i'm talking pre-50 too here  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  )   THere still has to be a "OH, that'd be nice if I can get a wizard in my group" type of spells or abilities.<P><BR>If nothing else, we gotta remember the agro our spells bring...and at higher lvls, if we can now match a warrior, what's to say we wouldn't accidentally out-agro him once in a while...we'd be dead in seconds.  I mean, I know I can't keep track of the agro on a monster by one of my tanks  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  And if we are using that root-breaking spell buff thing...what happens if it pulls on us and we don't have a 'chanter in the group....then again, our roots will prolly be resisted at that point anyway  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  heh  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  <P><BR>But my point is, dmg upping and mana efficiency isn't the only things needed to make the wizard attractive to a group.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>Personally, I think a defensive spells for later lvls would be great, around 20s I started tanking w/ my 'chanter due to Rune II....and it was nice not worrying as much as I did back in CB and lower lvls...then around 35-40, suddenly I was 3 hit dead man again.  Even with Rune III and Rune IV....point is, all casters need upped defensive spells.  SOmething in the form of making the monster "miss you" for a set amount of time or something like it..like this:<P><BR>Wizard's line:  Phase.  A self-buff that lasts an hour.  When a monster hits u, you phase out of our plane slightly and appear as a ghost image of yourself for 7 seconds....is triggered twice b4 the buff falls.  U cannot cast offensive spells when phased out and being missed.  In this time, ppl can attempt to pull the monster off you and heal you or save you.  THis would allow for some misjudgement of agro...and it helps, since you can't GET Concussion until lvl 60  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> heh  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Enchanter Defensive line:  Memory Muck.  A self buff lasting an hour that procs a near irresistable memory blur on the monsters hitting you...it can proc multiple times.  In this case, monsters can be taunted off u more easily when ppl hit it.  There'd be no way an Enchanter can do a memory blur at higher lvls when in trouble like this.<P>Ok, well, those are 2 of them  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  *Gives a pen to Absor*  You figure out the rest, heh  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  <P><BR>Krytal.<P><BR>P.S.: I should summarize my ideas...i had a billion of them...MAYBE it might go a long way to helping spark ideas in the long run, no?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Uzun?<P>You reading this? I am hoping that you do, as your response on lure nerf was only piece of what appears as not completely smoking moonrocks. Maybe you could tip us off on whether the scale of wizard class problems are acknowledged in any manner and solutions being sought for. <P>If we are going to get another comment in similar fashion as before, class needing minor adjustments but being balanced we're gonna freak out and turn into trolls.<P>You hear comments about us being unbalanced for doing too little damage and at the same time if we did more it would be enormously unbalanced too. If your line of no mana regen, no better nukes no nothing of improving damage output is not going to budge you have to come up with something that makes other, extremely dramatic additions to the class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A big part of the picture is the role that we WANT our class to be.  If we wanted pets, we would have chosen a mage or another class.  So, let's look at this again.<P>Increased damage DD spells mean higher agro, and increased kill stealing ability.  Because of this, I see little chance that we can expect this.<P>Lower mana cost for spells would mean we can cast longer, but have the same downtime after we go OOM.  This would help, but would also make it hard to see if we have enough mana to cast(I look at my mana bar when low on mana to get an idea if I can cast again).<P>Increased mana recovery over time would mean we can chain-cast without a short term increase in damage output, but over the long term, would give us increased damage output.<P>Reduction of resist rate when we cast across the board would help, not just on the lure line.  Let's face it, fizzles mean we just lost mana, pets missing an attack doesn't cost anything unless the pet is being attacked.<P>Increased/minimum duration increase on our duration spells.  Roots that hold for a fixed duration after they land, or hold for at least 30 seconds.  As it is, immobilize will often land, but then break within 2 seconds.<P>AoE root, which fits the wizard image, may overpower the class, but would provide crowd control abilities.<P>A root that is on the lure line, which could not be resisted.  This would make the wizard be required crowd control in high level areas where mezz doesn't work.  This is something that would make the wizard class highly desired, but wouldn't overpower the class.  As long as it doesn't break within 30 seconds, it would make the class much more desireable.<P>If my earlier posts were missed, enchanters could get buffs that would add many of the following abilities for the spell duration:<P>Duration spell effects could be increased by 25 percent or more.<P>Damage output from spells could be increased.<P>Decreased mana cost on spells could be another effect.<P>Increased casting speed.<P>Reduced chance to be resisted(a buff cast on the spellcaster).<P>All of these suggested buffs have a mirror already in place for melee classes.<P><BR>There could be added spell lines that would enhance the class, but the primary focus of the wizard class is damage output.  Sure, it's nice to get extra information on mobs, or to be able to extend our casting range through a pet or spell effect, but those generally would not solve the issue of class balance in my opinion.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There is one thing that I have seen on EQ that no one I've seen on message board has brought up.  This is Effective use of AOE's<P>Now I know most of you absolutely hate your AOE's and think that they will only get you killed.  This is very very true if you are playing in a group that has the mentality of picking only one target and pounding it to a bloody pulp.  But this can change, and change easily.<P>The best group I have ever been in was about a week in ago in Mistmoore grouped with a druid, bard, mage, monk, warrior and myself.  And we did AOE's gallor.  This was a mid to high 20's group and note we had no form of mana regeneration at all and the group felt I was invaluable...why because we can do one thing no other class can...we can deal out more dmg to more mobs faster than any other class.  How you ask?  By using our AOE's.  <P>This is how it worked...the monk or bard would pull...mainly the bard using his AOE dmg song.  As soon the mob would arrive...the druid begins casting his earth tremor..I count of the seconds the cast column of lighting so that earth tremor and colum hit at the same time...the bard is still  using his AOE song...twisting in healing and possibly strength...by this time..the mobs are really POED at the bard for his songs, and me the druid rank up there for AOE's if one of the mobs broke of to go after me or the druid...wham...the warrior and monk jumped in to pull it off.  About this time the bard is getting pretty beat up so. Next round of casting went like this...Bard=AOE song, Me=Colum of Lightning, (now the change Druid=Healing Bard and the Mage=AOE and the warrior and monk...were cleaning up anything on the casters.  Not that in this whole group we had no form of increased mana regeneration and I was never OOM.  It was actually the monk and warrior that were saying "man this is the fist time I feel like the useless player in the group."<P>With this senario we pulled 3-4 plus constantly..and I was doing between 390 to 520 dmg for 130 man that a ratio between 3-4 to 1  something our don't do for another 20 lvls.<P>The point is it can be done..and was done...the bard in our party also had a lvl 50 warrior and complimented me on how I played the wizard and wished other wizards at lvl 50 could play so well.  He was even more impressed when I told him this was my first and primary character.  This was not the only compliment that I recived that night from players of all classes twice my level.  Until then I like many of you felt that the class was and is broken.  It's not as much as you think..what is broken is the play style of most of the other players out there that think the only way to take out mobs is to have the chanter mes them and take them out one at a time.<P>I've seen posts on Graffe's site and Everlore of what a group of wizards and Chanters can do using AOE's what other class can participate in EXP pulls of 25-35 mobs...sure were OOM afterwards but my god..how long does it take to pull 25-30 mobs one at a time.<P>Ok now that I've built up the class..here comes the unbalanced part of it and actually they are more of things that are broken that unbalanced.  <BR>(1)  Rains need to only affect mobs, no players and no pets I mean it's hard enough to get a mob parked long enough to have all three waves hit it and if two of them are wasted on pets and party members they really arn't worth the mana.<P>(2) Al'kabora's spells need to be seriously droped in mana usage.  Sure they have huge are of effect but with a good group I can stack 4 mobs virtually one on top of another making the extra size of this spell usless except cleaning rooms in Blackburrow.<P>(3) A better way to increase mana regeneration...in a group without a chanter it's very difficult to be needed unless they know how to let you cast AOE's.  But you may not allways be in a place where AOE's are feasable.  My suggestion here is make it self only...every other class that can increase mana can do it to everyother party member..makes ours self only...and make it minor..like the rate breeze increases mana regen...but make it stack with everything else...or make it a skill that goes up like meditate...or make us regain mana faster when we meditate in our book post 35 vs not looking at our book.<P>(4)  Why does our discription of wizards refer to us as masters of traveling to far off places when a druid can do much better with there combination of SOW and ports.  I mean who wants a wizard to port them when they can get a druid to Port them and SOW them when the rides done?  That really is out of wack.<P>(5)  In the manual it says that there are planes rumored to only be accessable by to by wizards.  Why did all the velious planes have other ways to get to them that a wizard.  How bout making a lvl 55-60 line of spells that allow wizards porting access to each and every plane.  I mean it would really make me move valuable if I could get to the plane of mischief from say...Qeynos.  It would also put us back into the masters of teleportation where we should be.  Druids have mentioned as an add on ability while for wizards it's our main method of travel.<P>One last thing I'd like to say is that everytime I start to get down on my wizard and feel he's not adding much to a group...I get into a group that just clicks...and the whole group works together effectively.  Not allways will every class be in a group that lets them perform to their full potential.  In fact it's very rare to be in one that does.  That is why I'm in a guild.  Slowly am I teaching them how to let me be most effective and constantly as I log on I'm regarded as "Hail Queen Nuke!".  Something that allways makes me feel good...sad thing is I"m not the highest lvl wizard in the guild...the highest is about 10 lvls above me..but how well you play your character as well as the personality your charcter has makes the biggest difference in getting in a group..not your class or how out of balance you think it is.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have thought long about this and have a come to a conclusion.<P>Wizards do need a few tweaks to balance us. They are much needed but NOT wide ranging like most classes. <P>While faster mana regen, more buffs, better survivability etc etc would make us more powerfull. Thats not what wizards need or should get. <BR> <BR>I love the wizard class because of its simplicity and chalange of playing just right. We need the tweaking focused on two things.<P>1. Portals. Move West Karana portal near Everfrost would be great. There are plenty of ruins in everfrost to use as a portal location. While some argue the Cazic Thull portal I am ok with it. Also I don't mind our Velius spells beeing much more of a faction issue to get then druids. Hey I didn't pick a Wizard for the ease of play. <P>2. Spell Damage. We give up much in versatility to be the "Fast Magic Damage" class. Fine thats great. I don't mind beeing beat in the long run, thats not what we are for. What I ask is you test a wizards damage output verses other casting classes in short term damage. Sure we may beat them in one cast, but over the time of a full fight other classes can out damage a same level wizard post 50. Not constantly, but often enough.<BR>If I give up pets, summons, buffs, heals, Total damage output, then I expect Combat related skill (DD) to make up for that. Teleports are great but in combat they make little difference then the rare evac. <P>I don't think numbers alone show true damage output. I have tested this quit a bit with a friend and no matter wich of us was casting or wich mob we were fighting (from about level 40 to 50) Ice commit consistantly alowed one wizard to Take the kill from the other wizard casting a drought type spell. While on paper by numbers the drought spell should easily out damage ice commit, and take the kill. This was agian tested in the plain of fear byt tweo groups with 2 wizards each casting either IC or drought spells. The group with the wizards casting IC took the kills.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't think any Wizards really want increased short-term damage.  I can do far more damage than I would like to in the short-term, invoking the dreaded "overburn" death.<P>Long-term damage is where we need help.  Sure once I'm FM I can nuke away at the next few spawns - but even with clarity I'm stuck sittin a few out with no contribution to the group.  And without clarity, it is far worse.<P>-Less resists would be nice - but would only help in short-term damage.  We simply do a little more - then run out.<P>-More damage would mean more agro's and only help short term damage.<P>The only thing I can think of is increased mana regen rate or maybe that strange spell that was listed earlier.  <P>- The new spell I think would greatly help long-term damage output, while not offsetting game balance. (Decent damage, high cast time, very long re-cast time, very very little mana)  This would help us to contribute while oom (maybe one cast per pull while medding back to full) and not severely increase short-term damage.  (Nor would it help for solo-ing, as our roots are a joke anyways)  It may also help us do a bit more damage on the super-mob problem in Velious I am hearing about.  (I don't have first hand knowledge on this - Wiz isn't high enough yet) <P>-Increased mana-regen rate.  This is another way to get long-term damage.  Unforunately it will also greatly help us reduce down-time while solo-ing, making an already powerful soloing class even better.  (Quad-kiting anyone?)  <P>It seems that if long-term damage is at all in Verants Vision of a Wizard, that the new spell would be the best option.  <P>Oh - and one final thing.<P>-All other classes can do long-term damage, and damage while oom.  (You can argue enchanters because their pets are slightly weak - but they are a VERY unique class with a VERY important job.  So I don't think it is a valid argument.  DD is all we do.)  If Wizards are not given this ability - we damn well better be able to beat the living hell out of creatures without fear of sure-death before we get half our mana bar depleted.  And don't even use Root/Enstill/Immobilize as an excuse, everyone knows them to be a laughable spell that is only used to annoy druids.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>When I did my initial post on this division of the thread, I tried to follow Verant's apparent and explicitly stated ideas of the Wizard class and balance.<P>As such, some things I'd like to see or consider a balance issue I left off or moved to other areas.  Damage is one of the primary problems we face in terms of balance, as is the basic conceptual problem of starting out weak and ending up the same as everyone else.<P>Balance in its very core nature requires that everyone have roughly the same opportunities and a proportional level of difficulties, weaknesses and drawbacks as each other class.  No one class can have more drawbacks than any other without a corresponding set of advantages to the other classes.  No one class can have clear advantage in any skill or ability or opportunity over other classes without corresponding drawbacks and limitations.<P>This, then, is the task that Verant has before them, to examine each class with as fresh and unbiassed eye as possible, setting aside all prejudice or previous experiences with the class in an attempt to see them evenly and properly.<P>In terms of the conceptual design of the Wizard class, we have a distinct and obvious problem.  Verant tried to follow the AD&D standard of starting out weak and growing in power, weaker at the beginning than those around them, more powerful at the end than those around them.  Even before Kunark came out, this was not the result of the Wizard class, they were never significantly more powerful than those around them.  Further, the power level increase was limited to the very end of the Wizard's career, a small handful of levels.  The expansions have only made this failure more apparent.<P><BR>However, the stated intent of Verant is to have balance, for all classes to have a similar level of raw power and ability at the end certainly and throughout the classes presumably (based on the recent experience changes).<P>The Wizard class, then, is fundamentally in opposition to this concept - one cannot have a class that starts weak and ends up no more powerful than any other under this paradigm.  The choices are to raise the power level of the Wizard at the end of its career to be clearly superior in raw power and ability to the others (to compensate for earlier weakness and a long road to travel); or to make the Wizard more powerful and survivable at the earlier levels.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Suggestion for wizard spells 50+<P>- At level 52 a Spell that does X% (say 12%)of Mobs hit points.  The spell cast time is long (say 8 seconds), Recast (9 minutes),Mana cost 500, Stuns Casting Wizard for 6 Seconds (thus making it a useless tool for soloing, and leaves an effect on the mob so you cannot stack it. It would not work on Uber Mobs (Gods, High Level Dragons, etc)  Sort of like a DD Dot.<P>- Said spell picks up 1% additional per two levels up to lvl 60.<P>Unbalancing?  I'm not totally sure, but I do not think so.  The damage is significant enough that it will put a hurt on Higher level mobs and give wizards a skill that groups desire.  Non stackable and high recast time means using strategy of its use.  Hard to solo with it because it is % based and costs 500 mana and Stuns the Wizard for 5 seconds.<BR>I like the idea of seeing the message "XXXXX has been hit by non-melee 7800!" and actually seeing the HP meter of that crazy mob drop from its original 78k hitpoints.<P>What do you think?  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>In terms of damage the picture is less clear.  Unfortunately, to get a clear picture of the damage inequities it is impossible to show without a host of numbers, mathematical comparisons and most of all class comparisons by level.  Since none of these appear to be welcomed by anyone at Verant, I will try to avoid this as much as possible.<P>The concept of Wizards as we have learned from a variety of posts on here and comments other places by the Verant representatives has followed a basic pattern.  Wizards are not meant to be literally more powerful and deadly using every kind of magic than every other class in every situation.<P>Wizards are said to be the masters of fast damage, putting the hurt on the creature more furiously than any other class.<P><BR>for party members.  Once a Wizard is out of mana, they contribute nothing to a group.  The damage, then, is designed to be potent enough in the immediate that the down time waiting for mana to come back is acceptible to a group.<P>Wizards are designed to have no lasting effect in a fight.  The damage is instant, no real buffs This is most apparent in an emergency, when something bad happens the Wizard is conceived to unleash their superior, fast damage to save the group by ending the lives of the opposition.<P>We then have two questions here: <P>Do Wizards actually put damage out more powerfully and efficiently in the short term than other classes.  Not simply at the end of their career, but is this a trend and design that carries through and builds over time?<P>Is the concept of having a class built around fast damage and down time to pay for this a valid design for Everquest, especially as it has evolved to at this point?<P><BR>The damage a Wizard must do to be able to carry this task out, fast and powerful damage, must have two obvious characteristics: be fast and be powerful.<P>Wizard damage must be more powerful than any other class can offer in the same time frame, or the entire design and concept falls apart.  In the time it takes a Wizard to blast something, it cannot be possible for anything to rival that damage, against any target, or a Wizard not only does not do what they are designed to do, nor is any help to a group.<P>The questions for Verant are these:<P>-How much damage must a Wizard do on a single blast to contribute properly and effectively to a group?<BR>-How much damage must a Wizard do with his entire bar of mana to be effective to a group and be therefore balanced?<BR>-The damage that is done is affected by resistances.  Is a Wizard able to contribute properly in the current design in terms of types of damage across levels and in terms of resistances faced?<P>note here: the post 34 resistance reduction for Wizards and staff of temperate flux were added in under a correct understanding by Verant that Wizards required help to do their job.  The first is almost unnoticable at best, and the second is so minor and insignificant to be meaningless.  Looking at these to review their impact and design would be useful with this kind of balancing discussion.  <P>In addition, Wizards have 3 types of damage because they are supposed to be able to target their damage type against resistances, to take advantage of what creatures resist and do not.  However, Wizards need to go back as many as 15 levels to find a spell that will be of a given type, in effect negating the benefit this is supposed to give.  This, too, should be considered in a balance discussion.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The percentage damage of the mob is a suicide strike talked about in many fantasy novels.  If I'm going to die, I'm going to take my enemy down with me.  Anything less would make doing 7000+ damage per nuke suicide anyway, so this would need to be a 30,000 damage nuke that automatically kills the wizard.  And yes, it should leave the corpse.<P>Now, there's one very interesting point that hasn't been mentioned by many, and that's the amazing damage output of our rain based AoE spells when cast on a single mob.  Tears of Druzzil, level 52 spell.  At level 53, it does 600 damage per wave.  When there are multiple mobs, the number of waves drop from 3, down to 2 or 1(depending on how many mobs are in the area.  Pets are considered a mob by the spell).  If there is no pet, and only one mob, that level 52 spell will do up to 1800 damage if all three waves hit.  This is over time as well, so it's not as bad a taunt as most of our DD spells.<P>So, with this 1800 damage spell at level 52, it seems on the surface that we have the roots of what WOULD be a good level of class balance.  If this were made into a "only save once" effect over the duration of the rain, we would see up to 1800 damage, and not just 0, 600, 1200, and 1800 damage done by this line of spells.  Partial resists are rare, it's generally all or nothing per wave.  If this line were made into a single mob spell, that would move with the mob, it would work like a DoT with a different look, but would provide the damage that would balance our class.<P>1800 damage is what we look for when we think of being the masters of magical damage.  We don't mind it not being a DD, but I at least would like the spell to stick with the solo mob I'm trying to kill.  Note that a change to the whole rain line to what I have described would NOT allow this to be used in quad kiting.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The second issue is the speed of damage.<P>This damage must be faster than others, it must be an amount of damage that will resolve and take effect before others can equal that much damage.  From starting to cast until the blast going off, nothing and no one should be able to equal that damage.<P>However, here we get to a hazy point.  How long must this damage be superior and efficient before it no longer is defensible for Wizards?  Should this carry over only a single blast?  Should it be over 2, 3, 10?  How many times should a Wizard have this superiority in order to be useful to a group and be powerful enough for balance?<P>The questions in this for Verant are these:<P>-Is Wizard damage fast enough to take effect as desired?<BR>-How many rounds of damage does this have to be true for the Wizard to contribute to the group and fulfil the concept of the class?<BR>-Does this speed exceed the damage that other classes can offer their damage within the range of attacks above?<BR>-How much of a factor does and should mana efficiency take effect here?<P>Note: Wizards are outgunned in a single blast at some levels.  While the damage offered by a Wizard is faster by a few tenths of a second than other classes, the damage is less.  Is this acceptible?  If the damage is supposed to be more than one blast for a Wizard, then ANY class having more powerful blasts or bolts should be reviewed.  The answer to this is obviously for Wizards to get at least the same damage faster and more mana efficiently - against any type of target - not to lower anyone else's damage, since they are balanced based on their present abilities.<P>Another thing to consider is that the additional abilities of other classes, such as pets and damage shields, DOTs and combat ability must be factored in to determine balance.  To leave out anyone's ability assumes you take the Wizard at their best and the other classes at their average or less than best abilities.  Balance cannot be achieved in this manner.<P>A last comment on damage is this: The Wizard damage must compensate for lacking other grouping benefits, and take into account the ability to teleport others in an emergency.  Non combat teleports should not be considered in damage assessment because they are two separate settings and do not influence each other.  The fact that a class can move to another place quickly in the game has no bearing on the benefit they give a group while gaining experience and in killing.<P>Non Combat abilities need to be balanced against non combat abilities, and combat abilities against combat abilities.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>No, I will disagree with that.  Grim seems to feel that there are some major flaws in the class that makes us less than desirable to many groups.  That in itself does not say he feels the class is broken, just a number of things about the class.<P>The class is NOT broken, it's simply that to make the class GOOD, our rain spells need to be able to do 3 waves no matter how many mobs are in the area of effect.<P>Al'Kabor spells are GARBAGE.  Three times the mana should mean three times the damage potential.  The Al'Kabor spells suck mana like crazy, yet the pillar line of spells do similar damage for MUCH less mana.<P>Between these two things, a LOT of the complaints would go away for damage output.  The rain cloud moving with a single mob for it's three waves would also address a lot.<P>Wizards, the masters of magical damage.  We don't need to kill things in the shortest time possible, but we need to do the most damage with our bar of mana.  To increase damage output in the very short term(7 second), would mean we agro more, and become less effective becuase we are too busy dodging mobs.<P>Now, to an idea that's been said before, the ability to summon a demon which gets dispelled after the target is killed would be well within the image of wizards from other fantasy games.  This would NOT be a pet, this would be like a version of the stupid sword we can summon at level 59, but something useful.  It's not a pet, so won't respond to commands.  It's the trade-off.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I just want to be able to nuke more often.<P>Much more often.<P>I don't want DoT's. I don't want pets. I want to be a pure caster. Nothing but mana going' for me.<P>So that just leads to a naturally bigger mana pool for wizards and mana regen spells.<P>Why do NECROS get a series such as this but not Wizards?<P>Enchanters I can understand with that whole enchanting things, controlling the mind idea.<P>And so... Something like Clarity (or exactly like it with a different name) that STACKS with clarity would be great.<P>Perhaps make it an innate Wizard ability.<P>Warriors innately have more HP than other tanks.<BR>Wizard innately have more mana than other casters.<P>Warriors take more damage than other tanks.<BR>Wizards do more damage than other casters. NOT. But with a nice mana regen helping with Long Term damage it'd be ok. Though MORE damage on existing spells for a burst in the short term damage department would be nice as well, but LONG TERM FIRST.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>For the class to be good:<P>1) We need to provide something useful to a group when we are oom - something that will make wizards desired more in a typical pick-up group setting. At mid-40s, I'm experiencing for myself what it is like, sometimes for more than an hour, to find a group. No, I don't have a bad reputation. Yes, I can play the class competently (an expert I'm not, but I am competent). Yes, I'm in a guild. No, I'm never asked to join pick-up groups - EVER. Yes, if I'm ever to get into a pick-up group, I have to search - and that search is getting longer and longer these days.<P>2) There should be some reward for playing a class that is so narrow in focus, and so weak starting out, only to be 'just as powerful as any other class' (which, by the way, I don't think we are as powerful relative to other classes) at the end (anti-thesis of classical wizards). I don't know what that 'something' is unfortunately.<P>3) I want to put here that wizards should be more 'fun' to play. But this argument will get me dog-piled. I guess all I can say is that it is not fun to be totally useless after going oom. Yes, I work hard to manage my mana so I'm not oom. But that isn't really all that fun anymore. I want more fun abilities or group-friendly utility of some kind. I really wish we would have gotten the Magicial spell Call of the Hero - that spell fit our class concept as designed by Verant and would have contributed greatly to both fun and utility.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sineed (sorry if mispelled):<P><BR>"Is it hard because we need a well rounded group (warrior, enchanter, and cleric) to even think of using our AOE spells?"<BR>I almost never use them, they are mostly a waste of space. Grim thinks that is bad of me to say, as he feels it is wrong. *shrug* I seem to have more fun. <P>&gt;&gt;&gt; You think a wizard is easy. Try being in a AoE group and you will see differently. This is where a wizard can feel like a wizard, b/c it is hard and we are powerful (in this specialized dept.). If you are having fun without AoEs than I would attribute that more to social interaction than the actual satisfaction of playing the Wizard class ...especially since AoE spells are the best tools we have for fun. Standing up and casting a DD every now and then or rooting one here and there gets rather old after awhile.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt; btw, the group u want for AoE group is usually 3 Wizards, 2 Enchanters, 1 Cleric<P>"Is it hard because many of our ports will kill us, and our group?"<BR>Nope, not true. Use your ports with your eyes open, take the risk, or control it, or don't. "many" erm. hehe. Eh?<P>&gt;&gt;&gt; I agree there r always work arounds. But others suffer more than wizards do. So how does your advice help the Wizard class when it hurts others the most - like melee classes?<P>"Is it hard because there are levels when we are out DD by other classes?"<BR>Nope, that is life.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt; Your right it isn't hard, but is it balanced?  That is the focus of this forum.<P>"Is it hard because we are the class most effected by resists?" ROFL - NO. Play a chanter, get a resist on mez and tell me about it. Play a bard and get any of several resists. ROFL man, just NO!<P>&gt;&gt;&gt; Wrong! Bards and enchanters have much more to offer the group. If bard gets a resist than he/she switches to a group buffing/healing spell to make everyone else better. Enchanter will always be wanted for buffs and crowd control even if it proves hard. If you are a Wizard and just plain can't land a nuke, stun, snare, or root ...what more can you offer the group? Evacs. Well Druids can Evac and they can heal so why take the Wizard? Resists are our bane and we get shunned b/c of them. I think you have been grouping w/ friends or guildmates your whole career that just don't plain care if you are useless or not and just want to hang out w/ you. Resists certainly do affect us the most. I am astounded you can actually make that comment and believe you are right.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt; You are taking the getting killed argument, not the usefulness argument. If you wanna talk 'bout balance, talk 'bout usefulness. Resists affect every caster and us the most, and it CAN most definitely make our group friendly class non-group friendly.<P>It is hard because we must *THINK* about how to control the aggro, the fight, our mana pool. Learn what MOBs will pull off when hit with what spells. Learn what MOBs will resist what spells. It is hard because, like every other single class, there is balance. We have strengths, shared by other classes. We have weaknesses, shared by other classes. <P>&gt;&gt;&gt; I agree w/  those first 3 sentences, but *sigh* You are missing the point here. Yes we have strengths, BUT those strengths are quickly diminishing. They are diminishing as mobs grow in HPs, mobs grow in resistances, and as newer melee weapons have damage output nearly capable of keeping up w/ us in speed of damage.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt; Yet the weaknesses just plain get heavier. Pre-Kunark I thought we were for the most part balanced. Sure, I could never understand the geniuses behind the spell system ...especially pre-level 45, but I dealt w/ it and made the most of it.  I liked playing my Wizard and didn't see myself doing anything else.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt; Now we are a class sooo specialized it is disgusting. Either it is big raids (from what higher levels wizards say), or AoE groups which are real fun even though I haven't had the perfect AoE group yet. So where does this leave us for normal everyday grouping?<P><BR>"I love my wizard, please leave him alone."<P>&gt;&gt;&gt; Ok this is VERY CONSTRUCTIVE here. /** end sarcasm **/ Every class is going to get enhanced and you want the Wizard class to remain the same? Wow we are that perfectly balanced?  =/ ..guess I won't be buying Scars of Velious anytime soon than.<P><BR>Shenlung Tianzhu<BR>Level 36 Wizard of Brell<BR>Comedian and all around crass as ever!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Some finalized thoughts I had on improving the wizard class (i'll make it brief and summarized..i'll make 2 parts so ppl will actually read my post.)<P>- Add Fire, Ice, Magic spells at every lvl.<BR>- A "Specialize Meditation" at 35 that causes the meditation rate of ALL casters/preist/hybrids to go up faster:  waiting 12 minutes to go to fom?  I know many ppl that watch TV or read while lvling, cut the OOM to FOM time down to 5 minutes at most<BR>- Shadow step line: Make it TP u in the direction u are facing...and make it push u thru Agro, or at least invis u for a few seconds after u drop into your new spot.  OR, have it TP away the enemy and make him invis so he doesn't agro more things<BR>- Wormholes: Bascially TPs to places we can already go (Tox, Fay, NK, etc), only it'd open actual portals that ppl could walk thru.  The wizard wouldn't have to step thru it and it can close after 45 seconds.  Make it have collosion factors that make it castable in slightly larger openings (so openings to dungeons and stuff can't be blocked w/ a portal.)<BR>- new cons on stuff auto resistant to us (and raise the auto resist cap)<BR>- change AE agro, nuff said.<BR>- An all or nothing spell that "Depops" the monster and gets rid of him, without gaining exp. TPs it away.<BR>- "Phase" line of spells that was described above:  Self buff, lasts an hour (or until it procs 2 times.)  When hit u "Phase" out of alignment with our dimension....lasts 7 seconds (u appear as a ghost) and the monster misses u.  Procs 2 times.  Allows for agro mistakes...allows ppl to save u.  No offensive spell can be cast while phased.<P><BR>Krytal<P>P.S.: some of my better ideas...I have one more but will post it later, as the general population read only the smaller posts (including me LOL)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wonder why someone continues to play a class they no longer enjoy? Waiting for a fix that will never come? You become trapped to your character the moment you start believing its an 'investment' that you control. You do not. "Your in our world now!", Verant TM. <P>Maybe if someone could realize that all these problems they see with EQ add more stress to their life than enjoyment, they could break away and do something less stressful like watching a basketball game on TV. They may learn they like basketball games more than EQ and have an actual fun reason to leave EQ. My realization came during football season.<P>What I have learend about EQ is if Verant is capable of changing something in the name of "fun" they will not do so in the name of "Vision". Personally, I don't think Verant is capable of balancing the classes because as they have stated before its a moving target. Along with that moving bullseye is a moving ruler they use to judge balance and it shrinks or grows with the flavor of the month mentality. As they openly admit they can't please everyone.<P>Sinneed, even a paladin posted in wiz talk that the class needs to be changed. I guess what you have is blind devotion or maybe EQ time is also joint time.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055066-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055066.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055066-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055066-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055066-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055066-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055066&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055066&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
