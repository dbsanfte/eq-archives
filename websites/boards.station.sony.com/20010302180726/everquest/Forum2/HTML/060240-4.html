</FONT><HR>Other things to address:<P>- Risk vs. Reward in PvP.  The people who kill you are not required to wear your gear after.  A dressed tank at have life vs. a naked caster is really laughable.<BR>- Zone/Portal camping.  Typical activity is this:  You get 5 of your PK buddied together for an evening of fun.  Get a wizard and a druid.  Pick a random portal and GG to it.  Now, kill whoever gates in after you!  Wow!  Terrific tactics!  After you kill someone there, GG to a different portal and repeat.  If you get /petitioned for camping portals just answer that your medding in the portal!  How good an answer is that!?  Works all the time.  It's tremendously unfair to Kunark users who have one entire place to GG to.  Think I can figure out where to camp on a Friday night.<BR>- Unresistable spells in PvP.  While balanced for PvE, they are not balanced for PvP.  Something needs to be done.<P>Personally, I think that RZ should have been made Coin Only a long time ago.  Until there is sufficient staff to answer petitions in a timely manner, there is very little else sane to do.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here are some suggestions for PvP enhancements, for background, I play on Rallos Zek, best and only true server, highest character is a 48 enchanter. <P>1) Create a flag for any new character created on a PvP server for which the account holder has another character on a blue server, played in the last 10 days. This flag would serve to identify these blue server refugees to for the rest of the "real" PvP server population. This would allow us to beat and maim the folks who come over from the blue servers for some "kicks".<P>2) DO NOT CHANGE RZ. Leave RZ the way it is, coin + 1 item looting. If you change RZ to coin only, the whole reason a great many people play this game will be gone and there will be no point playing. You have no idea how boring and lame it is to log onto a blue server. The whole environment is different, it's sterile, bland and lifeless. I feel like the people that play those servers are zombies or lobotmized humans, lacking in some sensory function that prevents them from realizing the sheer boredom of their servers. <P>3) Create another PvP server with coin + 1 item loot. This will create a whole new economy and will, temporarily, reset the tables as far as twinks go. This will also allow those of us who have filled our character slots on RZ, to make additional characters to play in the same environment.<P>4) Let all of the wanna-be carebears from RZ move to Tallon or Vallon or even a bluebie server and let any bluebies or Vallon or Tallon folks (I'm not lumping you with the bluebies, you guys are definitely a step above) move to RZ if they so choose. <P>5) Create a system in which a player who has been PK'd can set an NPC into motion to search for the PK. Quests could include turning some character specific item into the NPC to start or end the quest. Maybe a dogtag or similar that everyone has and can be looted and turned in. <P>Who knows, some corny ideas I know. Lambaste me all you want. Bottom line: PLEASE NEVER EVER CHANGE RALLOS ZEK TO COIN ONLY OR ANYTHING LESS THAN COIN + 1 ITEM.....<P>ALL HAIL RALLOS ZEK!!!!!! GREATEST SERVER!!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>How about requiring that a player do a certain amount of damage to you to be able to loot your corpse?  It should be a percentage of your total HPs and not your current state (total natural HPs BTW).  Nothing is worse then getting killed at 10% life while killing a mob and then getting looted.  Make it a challenge to kill someone and a privilage to loot. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The risk vs reward on RZ is a tricky issue.  A ganker caster who is in full resist equipment will either decimate a melee, or if the melee has his own resist gear, the  ganker will at least get away, but in either case the melee wont win unless there are other circumstances, mostly because they cant catch the caster due to not being able to root/snare the caster and the caster just runs away or gates.<P>On the other hand,  a naked ganker caster is killable, but so what?  He doesnt risk anything.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Reply to Neferti's comments: <P>You suggest that there be a server similar to Rallos Zek but with a 8 level limit, and a 'GvE' server hardcoded. You also suggest that all one teamers can /movelog to the Rallos clone. <P>I am against this idea. Why? Well... I take that back. Your idea just needs a bit of modifying. Tallon Zek (or Vallon Zek) should be hard coded TEAMS, and the other server should be turned into the Rallos clone. Then those that wish to play GvE can move there. That allows a great more deal of roleplaying, for example: traitors. A High Elf Cleric of Tunare grouped with a Dark Elf Warrior worshipping Innorruuk would be a trader to the light, and could be treated as such. <P>It doesn't make sense to make a Rallos clone then suggest that people go there to play teams. However, it does sound feasible for that to happen in a GvE environment. <P>If this minor change to your idea would happen, I would be all for it. There would be no invulnerable healing as you said, those that wish to play true ONE TEAM would be happy, those who wish to play GvE (crossteaming) would be happy, those who wish to become traitors to the good or evil side will be happy, and everyone in general would be happy.  <BR>-----<P>Copy and pasted from my many responces to Nerf-ti's comments.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Thanx for asking absor.  I play primarily on Rallos Zek but some of my suggestions are for all the Zeks.<P>1 - AE Spells.  Make Point blank AE spells NOT hit our pets OR the pets of those we group with.  Make AE Rain or targetted spells NOT hit our pets, our group members OR their pets.<P>2 - PVP Looting.  It should be limited to the person doing the killing or a member of the group the person is with.<P>3 - Shadowknight harm touch.  The discipline should be subject to the 66% damage that ALL attack spells are subject to.  The harm touch ability should NOT be available to the shadowknight if they die and don't lose exp(kill themselves by drowning OR the low level newbie killing shadowknights).<P>Now...ideas I have.  <P>Balancing the naked caster:<BR>1 - If you are killed in a pvp fight, your spellbook remains on your corpse and is only lootable by the victim.  The killer(only) has the option to loot you for 5 minutes(real time).  If he chooses to NOT loot the corpse within that time, the corpse is locked to EVERYONE for 60 minutes from the time of the attack.  That way, if a naked caster comes to PK, all the players need to do is to kill him once and not loot the corpse.  And you will have 1 hour grief-free playing time.<P>2- Make spells lootable.  This was argued with the spell guy and he said that if this were implemented, they would have to allow weapons to be lootable as well.  Unfortunately that is not accurate.  Although weapons can not be looted, they are not SOUL BOUND like spells are.  If a PK wizard might lose his ICE COMET spell, he might think twice about attacking.  Also the VAST majority of spells are purchasible from vendors where there is an EXTREMELY limited amount of weapons available from vendors for melees.  You should be able to choose to loot a spell or an item from someone you kill.<P>3- Faction hits.  Faction hits were tried on Rallos Zek in a half-assed manner.  They should be MUCH more complex than just the killing blow gets you the faction hit.  First, they should be agressor based.  They should be allowed to be forgiven by the victim.  There should be a retaliation period where the 2 can reengage each other without having to take additional faction hits.  The retaliation faction grace period should be extended to the guilds of both players so that they can assist in vengeance.<P>Grief PK's:<BR>1 - Zone/TP camping should be bannable...there should be no confusion among GM's and guides on the Zeks.  We know the extent of the logging capabilities of the GMs.  There should be a logging of anytime a player engages in PVP with another player.  Specifically the location of each individual.  That way when a GM looks in the logs and sees that player A zones into a druid ring and is attacked within 5 seconds of a person outside the agro radius of the guards there, then that person is zone camping.  The logs should be able to show if the victim was idle or not(meaning they do or do not have control of their character).<P>2 - Attacking through walls.  This feature should be disabled.  There was an issue with people hiding behind trees and flowers to escape a spell's wrath but that was a far better reality than sitting the bank and being attacked by someone you can't see or attack back.<P>3 - guildchat monitoring.  Guides should have access to the guildchat/tells of people who have been warned for grief PKing.  At this point, only GM's have that access.<P>Just some ideas<P>1 - Charming/fear.  Reimplement them so that they can work in PVP again.  Limit charmed attack targets to other PCs.  This would eliminate the grief-charming where you would charm someone and make them attack a level 60 guard.  This would also eliminate the exploit charming where an enchanter and a warrior could break spawns with ease.  This would be very limited above about level 30 anyway since most players at that point have their magic resistance too high for enchanters/bards to land spells even with tashania.  But it would open the possibility of charming pets in order to make those classes think twice about summoning them in a PVP situation.  This would also make enchanters slightly effective in lvl 30+ pvp where they are currently limited to clarity/haste and dispelling.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There are a GREAT many servers available for players wishing to group all four teams together..for those that dont wish to roleplay the vast hatred between the races. <P>Every person who ever logged on to a race war server..did so because they liked the idea of having war between the races.<P>Friendships that have formed between different races dont get affected because you cant group with someone..friendships are to do with the chatting.<P>Allow people who have become bored with pvp and who now wish to fully cross team all races to move to a blue server so they can do VP etc.<P>Those who want to play the server as it was and should be intended are unable to do so due being invulnerable healed against. This involves people of the same race as the attacker healing their "friend" perhaps even guilded together (there is ogres guilded with ELVES!! THIS MUST BE CODED AGAINST!!).<BR>As a result those who decide to go against roleplaying and what the server stands for are impossible to fight.<P>Due to the large cross teaming guilds, PvP has become a rarer and rarer activity. Everyone shares resources with others and guilds are being formed that exploit against others and who defeat the whole point of the server.<P>PLEASE! : <P>Either Hard code it so that buffs/heals cannot be cast across teams,<P>Cross teamed guilds are not allowed,<P>or change the server name to <BR>Tallon Zek (PvP whatever goes, and we support exploiting btw)<P>P.S. and for God's sake change the uber guards..many very good ideas to make this better have been posted in a thread dedicated to this (Neferti)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I didn't finish my fear idea.  Allow it to work again.  In outdoor areas, make it so that the faction of the caster is what any wandering mob sees and make it so that they don't even remember the person that was feared.  Make it so that any agro mobs go directly after the fearer(providing he is KOS).<P>Fears and charms should wear off after the caster zones.<P>Fears inside a dungeon should make the person stand with fear instead of running through the zone to his certain death.  While this is comperable to the enchanter perm mez, fear duration is variable and at level 30+ it isn't going to be landed anyway because most players on the Zeks keep their magic resistance too high for fear to land.  Also while a person is feared, they should not agro ANYTHING around them BUT instead give the agro of the caster so that a wandering mob will not go after the victim but the attacker(providing the attacker is KOS).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Melara,<P>Hi there! In response to your point, it really doesn't matter to me whether Tallon or Vallon Zek becomes the 2 team server, because the one time /movelog would allow players from either server to decide. <P>Then all those lighty killing shorts, humans, and elves can stay fighting eachother, while we roleplaying light vs darks types can have the server we always wanted.<P>It will be funny to see the population on the 4 team server plumit (besides the darks, who will have business as usual), while which ever of Tallon or Vallon goes light vs dark will surge.<P>I expected to see more resistance from HR, LotU, and FS people because if such a server is created (2 teams) they won't have any innocent (unsuspecting) victims anymore...but there is no rational argument as to why a 2 team server can't exist as 95% or so of TZ plays that way anyhow.<P>As for hardcoding, well, I don't think hardcoding a 2 team server would be necessary, but for the high end panda type guilds, sure. I won't be healing or buffing any trolls with my high elf, even if I could!<P>Thanks<P>Cryn<BR>Inza<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Otherwise, they grief player will just charm the target, have a wiz nuke him and time the charm to recharm the target immediately after the wiz nuke hits.  Wait, no, dont reimplent charm.  They’d walk folks into the ocean.<P>I do however agree with keeping tabs on the logs to see that if someone is attacked within 10 seconds of entering a zone or portal, action is taken against the portal campers account.  Then there will be no more portal camping.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You know, 2 people mainly are saying that dots should be more resistable in pvp because druid and necro's can dot you and run away while you die. Well, here is a clue. <BR>Necro's don't have enough in the way of dd's so they rely on their dots. Their dots take a minute to a minute and a half to act. You are telling me that you can't cast 2 ice comets in under a minute? Get real. Yes they do a lot of damage, but it takes a while and how often do you see a pvp battle last a minute? HARDLY EVER at later levels. <BR>Arkons, you only want to be able to kill people in one nuke and have others not be able to touch you. If the pvp damage reducer is lifted for dd's ANY wizard with ICE COMET can kill a caster (and most druids) in ONE cast. How does that balance things? It doesnt. It makes the already powerful pvp class of Wizards that much more deadly. I personally would quit pvp if they did that. Thats 3 accounts Verant would lose. And YES ONE OF MY MAINS IS A 51 WIZARD! <P>You talk about druid heals being too powerful. I say BS. Use your tools. You have a spellbook FULL of interrupt spells and stun spells. Learn some tactics other than nuke nuke nuke nuke nuke. Try your stuns. You even have cold and fire based interrupts. <P>I dumb wizard is a dead wizard, but a smart wizard is the king of pvp. Look at Darkenbanes web site. Look at the screenshots. See the trend. The majority of the kills come FROM wizards. And Ice Comets in particular. Sure, most have a druid with them, but you see the druid casting starfire, or calefaction, etc. NOT their dots. WHy? because the fights last all of 10 seconds. It would be a waste of mana to use a dot when a wizard opens up with Ice Comet. Their tactic seems to be to stick a wizard and druid together and the druid tracks down a target and the wizard nukes it. Druid just helps out a little. <P>Wizards are awesome in pvp. Sure, High resist warriors may be better at times, but not always. And it would be too far in the opposite balance to lower their resists because a rooted melee is a dead melee. They cant defend against that. Especially without Egg Shaped Pumice.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Please do not destroy the PvE game on the racewar servers by not allowing cross-team guilding/grouping/buffing/healing.  I know this idea has been tossed around, but it just doesn't make sense for the following reason : THE TEAMS ARE NOT BALANCED.  They are not balanced in terms of their classes available, they are not balanced in terms of their population, they are not balanced in terms of the territory they control.  Only two teams have reliable FD pullers, I am sorry gnome necros I don't count you as good FD pullers.  Elves can't summon corpses.  Evil races have no tracking and only half the teleports available.  Dark races are for some reason "cooler" and practically outnumber the other 3 teams combined, it doesn't help that they have 5 races instead of 4.  The population situation is not self correcting, where a shortage of one race will encourage others to fill the void.  Much to the contrary, one team could simply "win" the racewar and make life miserable for the other teams permanently.  Tallon Zek had this problem for a long time, I think.  Way too many evil race characters, the light races either quit and made evils and the few who were left banded together to hide out in western Antonica.  Evils control much more of the high level territory, especially pre-Kunark, not so much after Velious.  A fun part of the "racewar" is alliances, banding together to overcome our differences and fight a common foe, or choosing to roleplay the fanatic purist who slays all who are different.  Something that people always overlook is that role-playing a peace loving character actually has significance on PvP servers.  On blue servers, there is no choice, but on PvP, it means something to shout, "Cease this endless conflict and seek redemption in the glory of Rodcet Nife!"  Please don't listen to a pack of upset twinks who have sometimes to deal with immortal healers and they find it annoying.  Just make it against the play nice policies or something...but don't further damage the PvE game, which most people agree is what EQ is all about anyway, it was never designed to be PvP.<P>my 2 cp</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Howdy, I've been playing on Vallon pretty much since it started.  There's a lot of things I like, there's some I think need fixed.  Please read.<P>First off, Itzena has some very good points and general fixes.  His post is back on page one of this discussion thread.<P>The way to fix the team servers is to not allow the buffing / healing of members of another team unless grouped with them.  <P>I'd really like to see a team server start up that allows item looting.  I know a lot of people that are still pretty salty because in order to do what they enjoyed doing since they start of Vallon, they had to go to a pure pvp server.  After Tallon went coin only, many came to Vallon.  When Vallon went coin only people were forced to Rallos.  <P>Personal Wishlist: Quests that give faction should give MORE possitive faction than they do on other servers.  You should have to sacrifice some of your time to go fix your faction, but as it stands it's very hard to fix your faction if you go on a PvP spree.  hehehe...<P>Thanks.  <BR>~ Parasyte (Vallon)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Naked caster can kill an equipped warrior, and if he doesnt, he still risks nothing more than a little wasted time.  If he does succeeed (ganks at one bub of health or so) he can potentially gain cobalt armor or some other item that will net him ungodly profit.  <BR>With coin +1 item there can never be balance.

</FONT><HR>Wow, this has built up fast, just the other day i was told about this post and now part 2 page 4, thats crazy.<P>I havent read the whole thing, but i did catch most of the blue names, and from what i gather ur suggesting hard codeing the teams so we cant buff / heal non teams. Quite simply thats not right. First off, its always been you people who have been saying its Everquest with PvP NOT PvP everquest. I play on TZ, and while ive been playing for olny like a year and a half, i know whats goin on. It makes no sence for a Human Paladin to see a Dwarf Paladin and attack him. Just not right. When my 51 Paladin sees dwarf Paladins i buff them, that would be impossible. But more look at it this way, Neco vs Tank in a low lvl dungon, ex Najena. Now those mobs will not agro on a 50+ person, cept while sitting or low on life. Necro Dots tank, sends in pet, tank(Paladin  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif">) roots pets and begins fighting caster, tank gets low on life, and is at lets say 1/4th of a bub, Mist ele agros cause hes low on life and get the kill hit on tank. That is very very bad, and most darks if they have the ability would call in a cleric to repay for the blunder with a rez, but that wont be allowed.<P>4 Teams will make the Game horrid. Lets say mainly in the 50+ game, shorts dont have Monks or SKs, no Planes for them. All the teams will have clerics, but no Shamans for shorts or Elfs. The 50+ game will be ruined for them.<P>AND THEN, theres the friends weve been building for so long, ever since the server was up the darks have been doing very well, so we joined with the elfs and shorts, whitch by all RP accounds is how it should be.<P>OOR healing / buffing is a problem, but locking the teams IS NOT the answer. If anything lock it at light vs dark. Please, dont hard code the teams, it will ruin all i enjoy about the game, and make me building a new charecter not worth it.<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif"> i Just had a idea, just now. If u decide to hard code the teams, do it on one of the zeks, and let people chose weather they want it or not. Let VZ move to TZ and TZ to VZ, and... well maby do the same to RZ. But dont force it on us, Please.<P>Janze Darkdemise 51st Paladin of Marr<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I play a lvl 54 shaman on Rallos and basically am ALMOST happy with how pvp works.  These are my greatest concerns:<P>1.  I'd like to be able to use my AE spell- they're absolutely useless on these servers because one has no control regarding targets.<P>2.  Balance class resistances and spell resistances.  Melee classes should maybe have a tad higher resistances, but not so high that it's literally impossible to stick a spell on them.  Additionally, why do some classes such as necro and druids get dots that cannot be resisted while my shaman dots are laughed off by anyone with meager PR and DR?  Same goes for wizzies with their lures, as opposed to mages whose spells are more easily resisted.<P>3. Sk harmtouch- instadeath is lame, needs to be fixed.<P>4. portal/zone camping should be eliminated.  Dunno if it's possible, but it would be nice to have some sort of timer enacted so that you couldn't be attacked in the first 10 seconds after zoning (or something to that degree). <P>5.  As much as it cracks me up to see Grairage talking about the problems with pvp (his guild is basically offender #1 on Rallos), I like his idea about no pvp from lvls 1 through 10.  Or at least give a switch.  It's so annoying to try to start a new character and just REPEATEDLY get killed, bind-camped, etc.. by the same person.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The number one problem on the Team servers at present is Immortal healing.  Players have become well versed in the art? of exploiting the level and race protections while circumventing them in order to kill other players.<P>The most egregious example of this, which occurs frequently, would be the guy with two accounts and computers, controlling a low level and high level at the same time.  The low level character used to attack players of his level, is invincible, thus immortal, in all encounters, and more than likely will use this power to engage in grief play.  <P>Crossteam healing and buffing, while not as powerful as the above exploit, is in some ways more offensive, as it is OOC, and prevents the team atmosphere that the racewar rules were intended to foster.  Players that try to play true 4-team, find that their supposed homelands are actually where their enemies are most powerful, due to the easy access to crossteam immortal healers.<P>I advocate one of the following remedies for this:<P>- Character PvP Flag prevents xteam/OOR buffs/heals.  This was actually proposed by Abashi quite some time ago, which leads me to believe the implementation would be practical.  When a character takes damage in PvP, he can no longer be xteam/OOR healed until zoning.  In many ways, this would be the ideal solution, allowing unrestricted grouping for PvE.  A variant on this would be to set the flag, only when the pc deals damage to another pc.  This would allow xteam/oor heals for defense only, making it more difficult to use the proposed flag to disrupt play.  <P>- Race and level restrictions on heals and beneficial buffs.  This would certainly solve the problem, but would have the downside of now longer allowing different races to group for PvE. A side benefit would be an end to the practice of powerleveling.<P>- Faction hits for xteam/oor healing.  Currently xteam/oor healing is the MOST POWERFUL tactic one can use in PvP.  Yet there is no consequence at all for using this tactic.  Faction hits, similar to assisting in PvE fight, would at least provide a minimal reason not to engage in this behaviour.  Ideally, these factions could be displayed in the /con message, allowing players to recognize race-traitors and treat them accordingly.  <P>That is really the only issue that takes considerable joy away from the game for me.  I am thoroughly entertained by EQ PvP, and highly skeptical that the upcoming competitors will be able to lure me away, though I'll certainly give them a try.  That said, here are a host of minor issues that could use improvement:<P>- While I appreciate the intent to avoid "sea-lawyers" by keeping the rules of conduct private, it has resulted in much confusion.  The majority of players, seem completely unaware of what is legal or illegal.  Even worse, some of the less experienced guides do as well.  A published code of conduct would reduce the number of petitions greatly.<P>- Loot and Scoot, a player-adopted code of conduct, based on Verants own rules regarding PvP has gone a long way towards promoting good-natured PvP among like-minded players.  Official endorsement of this code would also alleviate the petitioning.  <P>- Thrown weapons should not trigger damage from damage shields<P>- Damage shields should be limited by the level o f the recipient. <P>- The Halas arena is bugged.  Not only does it not function for PvP, but a duel begun there will cause the duellists to be bugged.  In duel mode, but unable to hit each other.<P>- Protection from PvP until control is regained when zoning would be nice<P>- Please give thought to game mechanics changes for PvE and their effect on PvP.  Seemingly small changes such as the moving of sow to a different spell stack from root, can have great impact in PvP.  This change severely reduced the effectiveness of root (no longer removes sow, movement being the key factor of PvP) while increasing the effectiveness of snare (no longer removed by root, still removes sow).  <P>Thats about it, thanks fer having a look at PvP.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I don't want this thread to degenerate into a "Bash Darkenbane" thread.  Lets make this clear.  Their guild is unquestionably the #1 PK exploit guild in the game.  They aren't even CLOSE to being among the worst guilds that PvE exploit(how does that one guild get some many COPIES of those hard to get items?  HMMM...)<P>As for other topics, the problem for tanks is risk vs. reward.  Right now naked casters have no risk whereas tanks do.  Add risk to the casters(see my post above), solve the naked caster problem.

</FONT><HR>No, they are not the #1 exploiting guild, and although they do have bad apple members that commit violations, it isnt because the guild tells them to or endorses it.  House in Visus is worse, I have seen an entire group of them assault players in Highpass Keep Bank.   I never saw Darkenbane bank kill.<P>Sure, they hang around portals, no one can deny that.

</FONT><HR>Thank you for looking at PVP again from a long time RZ/TZ player.  I now play a high level Dark wizard on TZ full time. My suggestions in order of importance/preference:<P>1)Hard code 4 teams. As this may be unbalanced to light elves/shorts a 3 team server with a "Faydark Stronghold" of light elves/shorts would be fairest and best IMO.<P><BR>If not possible then...<P>2)Hard code GvsE.  Darks have large disavantage here since Kunark but that's ok.  Allowing evil lights to turn in book and switch teams would make sense.  This solution follows the history of Norrath and gives the best RP environment I think, but it is not as fun as hard code 3 teams above.<P>These two changes are most important IMO. Current style of play encourages high level 4 team uberguilds that ignore all the history/atmosphere so they can kill toughest mobs/see all areas. They should move to normal servers to do that.<P><BR>Other improvements:<P>1)More risk in PVP.  When loot went out PVP became stale. Find a way to make it matter again! 15minute res effect, small xp gain/loss, no caster binding outside cities etc. Or bring back item loot again!! (Fat chance /sigh)  Something! Anything!<P>2)Get rid of uberguards.  Attacking cities is big part of PVPteams and the uberguards put a HUGE damper on this.  Unlike blue servers we could defend our guards so there was not the problem of newbies having no protection.<P>3)Get rid of /duel factionhits<P>4)Enchanter/Clerics need help in PVP. Increase tashani power and give line to clerics perhaps?<P><BR>These are the major points IMHO.<P>Thank you for listening and designing a classic game.<P>Asterix<BR>Tallon Zek<BR>Wraithguard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just want to suggest that changes made to Tallon do not have to be duplicated on Vallon.<P>Make Vallon a hard code non-crossteam, healing/buffing, server.  Let the teams group or guild together but, let them not, heal or buff each other.<P>Make Vallon a "Coin + 1 Lnventory Loot" server.  Equipped items would not be lootable.  Items in Inventory, including empty containers or the items within containers would be availible for looting.  I think that this type of looting would be acceptable.  The argument that, most players have against Full item loot is, the advantage this gave to the, less item dependant, casting classes who, could risk nothing and still be +90% effective in PvP combat.<P>Speaking of Caster vs. Melee.  You may want to look at restricting the binding areas available to casters to, the same areas availible to melee's.  This again speaks to Risk vs. Reward.  A melee who has just travelled by, running for, 5 zones, faces a greater penalty at death than a caster who, has bound themself, in a secluded spot within, the same zone.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060240-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060240.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060240-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060240-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060240-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060240-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=060240&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=060240&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
