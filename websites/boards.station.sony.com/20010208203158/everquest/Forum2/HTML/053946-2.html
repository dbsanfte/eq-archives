This also includes any name of a significant EverQuest NPC (e.g. Dorn, Trumpy, Karn).<P>-----Hmm nope, unless there is some NPC i have missed----- <P><BR>8) The names of senior Customer Support Representatives or employees of Verant Interactive or Sony Online Entertainment (e.g. Aradune, Solist, Rhystan) <P>-----hope its not this one-----<P>9) Names chosen with the intent or possessed with the effect of harming the reputation of a player or Customer Service Representative. <P>-----Hmm nope-----<P>10) Names containing titles within them, such as, but not limited to: The, Lord, Lady, Master, King, Knight, Sir, Father (e.g. Sirtallon, Lordeagle, Mothermaggy). <P>-----Hmm nope-----<P>11) Names that contain sentences, phrases, or more than two words. (Ikillorcs, Ontop, and Petcarbob, Diediedie) Descriptive compound words are allowed, especially in surnames (e.g. Treehugger, Giantslayer) <P>-----Key sentence here is MORE THAN TWO WORDS, so nope-----<P><BR>12) Popular and easily recognized names from existing media (e.g. Merlin, Gandalf, Belgerath, Tanis). <P>-----Hmm nope-----<P>13) Names where the combination of the first and last name form a phrase or violate a previous rule (e.g. Crymea River, Bran Muffin, Story Thyme) <P>-----Hmmm nope-----<P>****snip****<P>Perhaps the majority of the player dont consider Managirl a proper fantasy name but as I see it it dont violates the naming policy.<P>VI i know you dont comment on specific cases so you wont tell where the name broke the policy so I will give you a similar expample "Manaboy" which paragraph does it brake? Its must be 1 or 2 since the GM changed the similar name Managirl instantly.<P>All these threads are giving youre CS an even worse rep than it already have, people tie up alot of the character into the name, this is a RPG remember the name is everything, focing a change after a years play is just plain bad.<P>/Svart, RZ</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree that GM's seem very lax with the naming policy, and change names so rarely that when they finally do it looks like that person was singled out.  The other day I was with some friends in EC and we saw a lvl 8 Enc named Acidtrip.  I forget the details but this guy ticked off one of my friends somehow, rude begging or something like that.  Anyway my friend petitioned the name (yeah, petty, but oh well it was a lame name).  Anyway, now, a month later a /w all Acidtrip will still show this guy if he's on.  I gotta admit, even tho I don't petition names this one does bother me, I'm a recovering addict and LSD is one of the many things I abused.  Yet the GM's have done nothing about it in over a month.  I have heard of other cases where a GM has responed to and changed a player name in less than 15min of a petition.<P>Kragstomper Steinblade<BR>Dwarven Warrior of the 48th Drunk<BR>Druzzil Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Elementalist,<P>I know how you feel, my RL wife *used* to play. She was a female woodelf druid, reaching up to level 51. Once she received alot of juvenile harassment, vulgar name-calling (words that you just DON'T say to a female), etc. she quit. (And yes she cried.) After we petitioned, the GM just said, "Oh well, sorry." (and that included a screenshot AND a /report).<P>And we replied "cancelled".<P>After reading some of the replies from this post, it's a shame some people don't respect other people's feelings.<P>/hug Managirl</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Do you know how many names in other languages have meanins ?  They mean things, and when translated in Englins... we'd think... we'll we'd never call our girl/boy that... But others do in other languages...  So let's not be so Anal about this.<P>My last name is "DesLauriers", which in Englins means "Many Laurels".  You've got last names like "Green", "White", "Brown"...  and that doesn't sound Odd if you think about it...  Well, it's a NAME...  You have one, and you live with it.<P>There are some names that SHOULD be changed and looked into.  Me for one, I have a char called "YourFriend" which I'm about to delete.  Was told up and down that it won't last.  Do you know that "YourFriend" in Indian or in some other Language would be a VERY VALID Name...  He's an OGRE, he's NOT Human... ya, it's a Roleplaying game.  Are you telling me that an Ogre isn't Dumb enough to call himself "YourFriend"... if he has a soft spot.  Problem with Dialogs, and keeps telling others "Me Your Friend"... to the point where other Dumb Trolls and Ogres keep calling him "YourFriend".<P>Well in this case it's ManaGirl...  I personally don't see a problem with it...  What if the name we give our Characters are the NickNames we want to be refered as...  Is that Wrong ?  My Name's Jean Claude, but people fell it easier to call me JC (I'm in the States).  Should I flag everyone, and Kuss them... and tell them to call me by my name... or let them call me by a Nick name or Initials which is easier....<P>All this Naming Policy is all about, is being Anal.  And those that talk about Role Playing... Are total Morrons... cause no matter what names you have in D&D... you might make a name for yourself, and have a nick name.  Or prefered to be called something else when you start Adventuring... Maybe you don't like the name you're parents gave you, and you want a name that will get attention...  Well, we ARE going for Adventure... some of US wants to become FAMOUS or Powerfull...  If you're name is "Gasto Duh"... wouldn't you want it changed before you start you're carreer as a Warrior...  Well, you might have critters die off laughting at your name...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  But is anything here making any sense...   Cause some many people are so dense, and Stuborn in thinking there is only 1 way to name Characters...   There are abuses to take care of...  The bottom line is Verant's GM's are going too far.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Pain orc?", a newbie asked as he was immediately slain by the orc elite that had suddenly showed up at the foot of Kelethin tonight. A group of GM's decided to show their might with a group of named lvl 40+ orcs on the Tholuxe Paells server.<P>A good time was had by all as Sgt. Pain, Sgt. Slaughter, Captain Kirk, Colonel Klinger, and Captain Picard tore their way through the forest surrounding Kelethin and Crushbone. The green terror made their way from the newbie lift, to the POD lift, orc lift, orc hill, and finally to the entrance at Crushbone where they dug in and took many lives before finally being overpowered by many higher levels who had come to the zone intent on killing a GM.<P>When all was said and done, Greater Faydark was abuzz with excitement. Screenshots were taken and should be popping up on here very soon, I however was not among the photographers as I, a level 17 warrior, was killed with 2 hits for 300hp each!! To those warriors who took this mob, as I was not fortunate enough to meet because I was gathering things from my corpse at the time, I salute you, and kelethin salutes you for so valiantly defending our home in the trees.&lt;&lt;<P><BR>Captain Kirk is an orc...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>IMHO, the name did violate the naming policy.  Not the last name, but the first name.  It sounds like some cheap B-Movie super hero.  If the change of a caused someone to break down and cry, then you are obviously taking the game way to seriously and need to stop playing anyways.  How would I feel?  I would probably be upset, but then again, I do not come up with stupid names.  I come up with genuine original fantasy names.<P>I mean think about it, how would you feel if you went to go see Dragon Slayer or Excalibur or (more recently) D&D the Movie and there was a character in the movie named Managirl?  You would walk out of there going, what a stupid name for a character in a fantasy movie.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Akeezi.... Akeezi....<P>Sit down, take a breath...  I wish you would have seen the life I had to live... hehe<P>I've been with a Feminatzy, a Psycho/Manic Depressife, Woman from the Hood... and many more in the Normal side of town... hehe<P>I don't know Everything about woman, but I can understand from my experience that some woman will cry for things, Man cannot comprehend.  Man in General are not as sensitive, or better yet...   The things that matter to Woman, are not necessarely the same that matters to Man.<P>My son has been sick for 3 days, finally got back to school today.  My wife started to get worried big time, and started to panick...  I on the other hand mostly reacted like...  it's normal...  He's going to be fine...  Should I think she's Way too sensitive or Emotional ?  No... she's being a mother.  Well, some guys will tell her to "Shut the F* up"... cause they can't be bothered...  and I know that she went through that when my son (step-son) was 3 months old and had to be operated...  His father was acting like she was worrying too much and told her in her face that she needs to chill out...   Can you say being Stupid ?  Tell a mother not to worry about a 3 months old baby being operated on.<P>No... Don't know everything about woman...  Never will.... and Woman will NEVER know everything about man...  Why ?  Cause we both think differently... Way different.  But I can see a Guy that has to tact, and talks stupid when I see one.<P>As for the comment about my X-Girlfriend... this was not a put-down on her behalf, it wasn't meant to be.  But that was here LIFE.  She "Couldn't" live without it...  Take that away... and she would have broke down.  Why ?  Cause she made it that way...  Some Man do the same thing with Cars...  put everything into cars...  if it ever get totalled, and it was their 1 Main thing in life... you thing they won't get Emotional in any way ?<P>Wow... all this emotional mombo-jumbo... hehe  Either way...  I'm not a know it all...  All I was trying to say, is I surely know enoug to tell him he was rude and ignorant in his post.<P>Sorry if that offended you Akeezi.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The sad fact of the matter is that the k3Wl Do0dz use the naming policy to own camps ("Hey, this is MY camp, you don't like it, I'll petition on your ass to have your name changed").  Don't believe me?  I've seen it happen.<P>Also, I have seen people with perfectly good names (that were descriptive of someone in their class) get their names changed.  At this point,. why don't the frigging GM's just let you choose a name, then before you eve start playing, come along and say, "Well, nice name, but we don't like it...so here's your new name Somedumshlub.  Everything is working as intended."<P>The truth of the matter is the creators of the game made an out by saying that they weren't bound by the same rules as the players.  Pardon me, but why don't you guys come down off your cloud cities and get real.  Personally, I think all the frigging K3wl DewD names should be wiped, and they should maybe use a brain cell in being a bit creative.<P>But the thing is, I've noticed that EQ has become a hiding place for the most annoying, anti-social, and rude people I have ever met.  I can truly say if I wasn't in a guild, I would have quit the game a year ago.  I play because I have friends in game, and that's one reason I enjoy it still.<P>Top end this, Verant, get off your fat butts and start realizing that people create a character to be what THEY want it to be.  If you can't follow your own naming policy, why should we be expected to?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>JCDDreamer, <P>I cannot believe you are comparing crying over having a chat handle changed and a sick child, now, its arguable that the child is not going to die, and it may be an extreme reaction, but its a normal, natural, and even healthy one.   Let us TRY to be reasonable here, I know that sometimes women can get emotional over seeming non-issues, car not starting for example, or their SO having a moderately bad day at work, but thats not in the same league, not even the same game(no pun intended) as crying over having your EQ character name changed, reminds me of that slightly absurd Chick Tract about the evils of role-playing and how the woman's character dying lead her to suicide.  If you have that sort of reaction, perhaps you shouldn't be playing this or that sort of game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
