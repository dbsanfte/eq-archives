</FONT><HR>Dravyn writes:<P>"In the reality of any fantasy situation..."<P><BR>Have you ANY idea how absurd that sentence sounds? There is no "reality" that applies to every fantasy situation. There are no cut-and-dry "rules" about fantasy/RPG games that must be adhered to in EQ. Every fantasy environment is, by definition, its own environment, free from the restrictions of any sort of 'reality' or set of imposed rules. The power of Darth Vader does not apply to EverQuest. This is EQ, NOT Star Wars Online.<P>Your logic, essentially saying that SKs should be the most powerful class in the game beyond leaps and bounds simply because the SK-type villains in movies are such, is laughably wrong. We are NOT comparing Maximus to Darth Vader. We are comparing a warrior in EQ to an SK in EQ. You cannot mix spheres of different fantasy worlds to meet your own expectations.<P>I'm sorry if you went into this game thinking that your SK was going to be able to choke opponents to death with a mere thought, or wave his hands and send monsters flying across rooms. That would be fine and dandy if this were VaderQuest, but as it stands, this is an entirely different 'reality.'</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Dravyn fantasy literature is replete with examples of warriors taking down evil magicians and powerful lords.  You speak of Conan.  Hey, didn't he kill that Snake god?  Hmmmmmmmmm.  Mighty steel vs cunning dark power.  Mighty steel lopped off his head.  You give me half a day I'll compile a whole page of examples where "mere" warriors triumph over the SK archtype and many other seemingly more powerful dark powers.<P>To the people saying this is class envy, I throw that RIGHT back in your face.  It seems that many hybrids all want what warriors have?  Boy thats class envy.  You won't find me asking for one single thing for my class except improving Taunt, and maybe AE Taunt, though that is a dangerous request.  I'm not jealous of SK powers, nor Paladin powers, nor Ranger powers.  I simply want you hybrids to stop pretending that they mean nothing at all to you.  I see the argument all the time that sow doesn't help you against the uber boss mobs therefore rangers should be made more powerful melees (just an example, many hybrid claims are based on saying their abilities are worthless therefore they deserve to be better warriors)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>LOL Dravyn.  You ask us to consider your point of view but you throw out a dumb example to support it.  Bringing up Conan wasn't a real good way of shoring up support for ya bud.  There is no doubt that Conan defeated a dark powerful warrior (an SK)  opps.  Back to the drawing board.  In any case, movies and fantasy novels don't have to worry about class balance.  The more handsome hero will always cut down the dark lord in those.  In EQ there is a whole world, with many different combinations of classes and races and people to consider.  <P>I'm not complaining that MY class is weak and ineffective.  I'm just trying to bring some sanity to the arguments that I see people like Claridad making in this thread - http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058271.html -<P>Its not ok to totally devestate the warrior class by making SK's as powerful melee and still retaining their spell abilites.  Its not ok to make SK's even 90% as powerful melee as warriors and still retain all their spells and abilities.  Same goes for Paladins and Rangers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok here is the good news. Now you dont have to use those crappy 1HS weapons any more. With the changes you can just focus one what REAL Warriors do best - deal damage. Swap in your 2HS and just swing away. Delete your taunt button. Let the new buffed up Hybrids do the tanking. Heck it works for me. Besides if you Taunt then you get hit. If you get hit you might die. I hate dying so I never Taunt and I always use 2HS weapons to minimize the taunting. You just don't know how to play the game. The object of the game is to stay alive. As Patton said "Let the other guys die for their country". The perfect battle for me is when the Ranger, Sk and Rogue all die and the Cleric, Wizard and I are all alive at the end. Real easy game if you understand how to play it. ;-0</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

However, it is so terribly flawed that it warrants no consideration. You CANNOT apply the logic of other fantasy worlds onto a video game that strives for class balance. The very nature of your argument calls for one class to be supremely powerful. As such, you are arguing against balance. EQ is about BALANCE. How hard an idea is that for you to grasp?<P>Furthermore, you fail once again to understand that, by DEFINITION, fantasy is NOT hard-and-fast reality. There are NO general rules that apply to every fantasy situation. Anyone who creates his own fantasy world is entitled to make it as bizarre and totally unrelated to previous fantasy environments as he/she pleases. EverQuest is a fantasy game unbound by the artificial restrictions you may claim were set forth by various movies. Chief among the concerns of these class talks are the issues of balancing classes. Making SKs far and away more powerful than warriors simply because you -think- evil has to be more powerful than good is irrational.<P>By a counter-argument to your own: why are we not to assume that a shadowknight has spent most of his life studying swordplay as well as the dark arts, and hence has not had the time to become as skilled with the sword as a warrior who has spent his entire life focusing only on armed combat?<P>Do you understand a word of what I'm saying, or are you so firmly entrenched in your closed-mindedness that this whole post will go in one ear and out the other?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Mythral I've done the same thing with them.  I'm not reaching for more power for my class.  Indeed I find my class very nearly perfect.  I have said the same things to the Thoggs of the warrior class.  I also oppose druids who say their class is worthless.  I doubt we have many things we would disagree on Mythral, I just want you to be honest and admit that having the extra abilites and spells that hybrids have is worth losing some tanking power.  And to admit that making hybrids equal to warriors while maintaining those spells and abilities would be a real blow to the warrior class.  If you can't admit those things, then we've got nothing really to discuss.  If you can admit those things then really the question is one of real balance.  Not balance at the very end boss mob of a dungeon, but overall balance in the hole game.  You can call me a troll all you want but I'm being reaonable, not asking for anything for my class except a better taunt.  And asking that the rest of you be reasonable right back with an honest discussion of the hybrids.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>Well Ailbe, now we're talking.<P>Just look at what's unraveling on the test server... The only improvements hybrids are getting so far is in one particular melee skill.<P>Pallies/SKs = Defense, while other defensive skills and all offensive skills remain the same.<P>Rangers = All offensive skills equal to warriors, with a huge disparity in their defensive skills.<P>So they're being brought to par, or almost, with warriors in one area only, which actually makes hybrid melee even more specialized, or limited one could say, than warriors. With the proposed changes, hybrids get to be efficient in one particular area of the melee business. SKs/Pallies become good tanks, but still definitely lack in damage output. Spells help offset the discrepancy, in offense for SKs, in defense for pallies.<BR>Rangers get similar damage ouput, maybe superior with their spells, but will certainly face a lot of agro management problems since they won't be able to tank crap.<BR>In the end, you get, in theory at least, some kind of balance with warriors, who remain the jack of all trades of melee, all in one character.<P>Remember also that rogues and monks have enjoyed since Kunark melee skills equal or superior to warriors, yet no warrior raised a tantrum about that at the time. Yet they have some of the most praised utilities you claim hybrids enjoy with their spells. With their skills monks can FD, rogues can sneak, run virtually invisible, and evade.<P>You're also talking about druids, well I kinda disagree with you on their "power". While they're pretty well rounded-up, they still are in dire need of something that makes them useful on big raids.

</FONT><HR>I cant belive this is such a debate?<P>Warriors are simply saying that they would like verant to keep there promises. <P>Didn't they promise warriors would be the masters of melee?<P>they then buffed many classes to outdamage warriors, they defined masters of melee, as being able to take a hit better then anyone by far.<P>so warriors remained silent and accepted this new role.<P>now they buffed hybrids again because they whine, and now they have the same defensive capabilities as a warrior (and before you spout off about how warriors are still so much better, SHUT THE **** UP IF YOU HAVENT PLAYED ON TEST, the higher dodge, riposte, skills are neglagable in combat.  you'll see this on test).  <P>now we no longer have the best offense, nor do we have the best defense, with the soft cap of 1100ac, we dont have the highest ac, nor unbuffed do we have the highest hps.  while buffed, due to hybrids abilities to heal, they in effect have more hps then warriors.<P>hmmm... lets thing, masters of melee, yet we are not the best at any of these things?  and you wonder why we complain?  excuse me?<P>i agree that the eq system is difficult, because by definition hybrids are versitile but not the best at anything, and to be truely desired, everyone needs to be the best at something. <P>hybrids complained because they weren't the best at anything, so verant buffed them up, and now if the test changes go through, they will be better tanks then a warrior, due to the fact that they can taunt better, and take a hit just as well as us now.<P>now you'll see the warriors complaining, cause we are no longer the best at anything, and frankly we WERE PROMISED BEING THE BEST at melee, YOU AS A HYBRID WERE NOT.<P>the fact remains, warriors HAVE given up a lot by not being able to cast spells, with an understanding that they would be the best in melee.  Now that this is being taken away, we feel we have been penalized (no spells) for nothing.<P>what needs to happen, is every class needs to have some speciality, something that makes them unique, something they are best at.  this would make all classes somewhat balanced, (as long as all unique abilities were equally desired) power has nothing to do with it, we all know there are classes that are much more powerful then other classes, but this really doesnt matter, as long as the next class is equally desired for his abilities.  screw the power balance, lets get, desired in group balance.  this would solve much of these complaints.   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't go after monks and rogues because don't see endless thread after thread making wild claims about how worthless they are.  I see rouges upset because of the evade thing.  And you know, when I see a rouge saying that nerfing evade will ruin the class and no one will ever play one ever again, I laugh just as much at them.  I don't object to equal and even superior damage ability in rogues and monks because largely they pay for it through the nose with far less HP.  Last night a monk in my group was chortling about his 2800 hit points with all his buffs.  I stayed quite with my 3700 hit points :P  sure they are offensivly superior most days, so are many rangers that I've met.  They have to do that agro thing because if they go full bore taunt they will die, very fast.  So now what about Pallys and SK's?  Their damage is not half of a warriors, that is pure BS and anyone who plays the game and watches it knows it.  So putting exaggerations aside, with a good defense (which they are getting with this patch, I've already indicated I'm all for that, seems most people choose to ignore that though unfortunately) and moderate damage output, almost equal with spell effects, Plus their utility outside of combat, how much more should be done?  Realistically how far can you go without really making a warrior useless.  <P>Balancing hybrids does not mean getting revenge on warriors for perceived lack of grouping in the past.  It has to be fair, throughout.  Any claims that your not effective against a boss mob SHOULD be ignored because thats not the only consideration Verant should be addressing.  Improving the entire class for one mob is ridiculous, anyone should be able to agree with that.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>Ok, let's focus on SKs and Pallies then.<P>Depending on what gear they have, a SK/pallie will do 50% to 75% of pure melee damage compared to warriors.<P>On a parsed log against a focuser in PoG (those stupid midgets with 1 million HPs taking 1/2 an hour to kill), I was doing 70% of the melee damage the lvl 60 warriors were doing. I'm a lvl 60 SK with the best weapon you can hope to get, the epic one, BTW. And one of the warriors didn't even have his epic. I added to that the damage I managed to do thanks to my DoTs, and I still wasn't getting close to their total. Even discounting the procs on their own weapons. As for pallies (with their epics) and other SKs (wielding ebon mace, the 2nd best SK weapon) who were also in that fight, they weren't even in the top 15 melee damage dealers. Their output was close to 50% of the 2 warriors. So that claim isn't false. Dual wielding and superior weapon and offense skills DOES make a helluva difference.<P>Add to this clearly inferior tanking abilities and where do hybrids clearly cut it in the current grand scheme of things ?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>LOL, Iv'e been called a -Thogg- After more than two years on these boards thats the best. lol<P>But let me see if I can explain to Ailbe in simple terms he can understand, without resorting to name calling...<P>Ailbe says...<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Your saying that your pet doesn’t do even 54 points in a combat? I can prove you WRONG in every fight I’ve ever been in with an SK with a pet. I have a shaman, our pets are about on par, my lvl 40 shaman has a lvl 30 something pet, and it does far more than 54 points of damage in a fight.<P>Actually Ailbe, a shaman pet is about one rank higher than a SK pet through most of the levels. I run with a Shaman regularly and his pet does do considerably more damage than mine. BTW we do not get a 30something pet until level 52. That is many levels later than a shaman gets their mid 30s pets. Also if you remember correctly shamman pets were recently buffed up, to do more damage, ours were not. I admit my 52 pet against a low mob may actually manage to eek out about 90 points of damage, vs a blue, but so what? what is that like two whole warrior crits? Perhaps only one crit. Your flaming detritis aside, you obviously know nothing about how innefective our pets are pre 58th level. Where we finally get a decent pet, level 36-40 or so but by then, the mobs we use it against, its still pretty worthless. Do not compare a shaman pet to a SK pet, they are not in any way the same.<P>Then you said...<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;We have to pay for those potions etc. For an SK they are inherent with your class. You don’t have to cringe and go opps theres 10 plat every time you swallow an invis potion. Jboots? Those are insanely hard to get, requiring a very very very long camp to get. And then you have to pray that no uber guild lvl 60 wizzys are waiting around to KS it from you. I’ve done that camp for my cleric. I’ll be damned if I will spend another 16 hours on a camp of the AC. I’ll take my sow potions thanks.<P>Hate to break it to you but SKs dont get sow either. I buy the same potions you do. I camp the same AC spawn you do. I get KSd for the trouble, just like you do. Your pitiful whining over your need to work for sow is pathetic. <P>&gt;&gt;&gt;Every mob sees through invis? Well I’ll be damned. Guess those invis potions your advising me to buy are worthless, what a meanie for suggesting it eh? <P>Yeah, they pretty much are worthless post 50. Burning woods, Sebilis, Karnors, Traks teeth, most of Velios, Invis is useless, most mobs either see through it, or there is a solid mix of living and undead mobs that make being invis pointless. So my point, again simply, is that invis is not something to be touted as the be all, end all of a classes balance post 50. It should hardly be considered at all as it is hardly effective. But all you see is "He can invis! Wahhh! Wahh! What a crock.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;Nobody wants you to FD Pull? That’s so obscenely stupid I’ll let it stand as a statement to itself. <P>No it isnt stupid, its a fact. In the Post 50 game, the highest level player usually pulls. Period. Regardless of class. It has to do with resistances vs mob attacks and HPs for surviving. The only time this really isnt true, is on a plane raid. Which usually has at least one monk who is designated puller. They have a much higher chance of survival with their improved feign over a SK. So I say again. Feign pulling for a SK, post 50, is rare. Very rare. Monks are abundant.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt; {spells} Overwritten by other classes? Only if every group that has an SK also has a necro. That’s rarely the case, except in multi group raids, which again is not the entirety of the EQ experience<P>Wrong again non SK playing dude. Druids, Shaman, Necros all cast DoTs that over ride ours. Not just Necros. Rangers snare overwrites dark as well. Until just recently, you could count Clerics, Paladins and wizards into that group as well as root would also overwrite our spells. At least that was fixed, just recently. However our Dots are still overwritten by anyone elses dots.<P>And more to the point, Dots are currently banned from most raids, due to the dot mob poof bug.  So there ya go, once again half of a SKs abilities are sitting unused in high encounter situations.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;Again for the slow people in the crowd. How many uber boss mobs DO you fight in one day? The most I’ve ever fought was 6 in one day and that was pulling that Ixbat fire elemental thing for the cleric epic. <P>Personally, I find the majority of my time post 50 is taken up by raids or Boss mob encounters. Only, I do very little when Im there. Sit and wait for the monk to pull something back. Target raid leader, assist, swing my 1hb attack, miss a half a dozen times, and wonder who got the exp on that one. Wish my Dots werent banned, oh well, with this many necors and druids, and shamans about, really wouldnt mater if they werent I suppose.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;I bet you go to Karnors and Seb and Chardok just like the rest of us do. And there you are very viable, very wanted.<P>Yeah, I do alright. As long as there is a warrior, enchanter and a cleric present. Otherwise, nobody wants to try it with just me for their main tank. For some reason my invis and FD just doesnt impress anyone. Go figure.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;Yep Resists rates are climbing and climbing, and it is HURTING the high level game and Verant NEEDS to respond to that issue. <P>Well, at least we agree on one point.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;I am saying that those utility spells allow you a freedom and yes power that a warrior doesn’t have. You can deny that all you want but while I spend hundreds of plat on potions and you keep just clicking on a spell gem for the same effect, I’ll say you have more utility. <P>Hows that 10% exp bonus you get on every kill working out for ya bro? I wouldnt know, I dont get any exp bonus. You still moaning about Invis? I thought we covered that. And like I said, I buy the same sow potions you do. Actually I also buy DS potions as very few of my weapons proc anything worthwhile. How many procing weapons you have bro?<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;My warrior is Insanely poor most of the time. And the equipment that would replace those potions is Insanely rare. I would love to just ‘bop’ snap my fingers and be invis, but no it costs me money to do that, money that your saving to help buy your shield and weapons upgrades<P>This has to be the biggest envey whine of the day. Warriors have so many more weapon options than we do it isnt even funny. Hell, I remember my 20s and 30s wondering why I payed an exp penalty for spells, when every rogue and warrior around me was casting darkness off a proc of their weapon, exactly the same as mine. <P>You think I just make money hand over fist going invis for people? /shout Accepting donations, to let you watch me go invis!<P>LOL. Yeah, I save money, on being able to cast invis. While Im in a game where invis is near worthless at my level. You have some real issues bro. But it's not with SKs.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

You can still be master of something even if someone would be better than you in one small part of that overall field since they would be lacking in many other parts of that field, just as hybrids are in melee.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>No, my pet does not do more. Check any log file. In order for it to do damage it has to be able to hit. When it does hit it is usually for 1 pt of damage. An occasional 20 - 40 pt hit might get through if the fight lasts long enough.<P>Regardless of whether he does 50 or 90 or even 120 points of damage, in a very few cases, he does no where near the same amount of damage as any couple of crits warriors get in combat.<P>And pets cannot be used in many many situations. When are crits a bad idea?<P>Even funnier is how you moan about our having invis and then state how you use it succesfully in several dungeons. I guess having the ability to invis is not such a SK only ability as you say.<BR>Not to mention the fact that what you say is bogus, invis wont work past even the first set of mobs in Seblis, or Karnors for that matter.<P>And yes, level is the primary requisit to pulling in places like seb, karnors, and so on. Im not saying you send out the 55 wiz over the 54 SK. But a 55 Rogue will pull before a 52 SK anyday. And you know it.<P>And whether you realize it or not, you still do not make any worthy argument as to why the proposed changes to Hybrids, have any detremental effect on warriors at all. Which was the point of this thread to begin with.<P>You are just continuing to whine because we have spells you have to cast by potion. While we have no potions to allow us to take a hit or deal damage anywhere close to what a warrior can do. <P>Tell ya what. You can keep buying invis potions, (yeah right) and I will give up any and all minor improvements to my class being discussed. In exchange I would like to see new potions implemented in game. Ones that improve my defense, my dodge, parry and riposte, gives me dual wield, Triple attacks, raises my Offense, gives me higher caps in 1hs, 2hs, 1hb, 2hb, 1hp, 2hp, kick, crits, crippling blows, berzerk, and kigher AC and Hit points.<P>I mean it's only fair. You get sow and invis on potions armor and weapons. Not to mention life taps, DD spells, Damage shields, regens, heals, snares and so on. So we should get the reverse. The ability to tank via potion. Now everyones happy.<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I guess were getting somewhere, your admitting that your pet does do more damage...  I looked it up, lvl 39 shaman pet is 24 to 27 hits for about 31.  So your saying your 52 pet isn't even that good?  I know the 50+ game is a bit different, I play in that game to, but it ain't that different.  In any case, maybe you don't quite understand how crits work.  I'll see a crit for 54 points and the very next hit will be for the exact same abount, or even more.  A critical hit is not some magiacal triple damage producer.  Crits are eye candy, and I'd say they are probably just as useful to a warrior as a pet is to an SK.  Except that when I do a crit, that is my hit, regardless of whether it was spectacular damage or not.  When and SK's pet hits, that the pets hit, the SK still gets his damage chance too.  Crippling blows are generally a lot better hit, but you better hope your not dipping that low in health too much or the cleric is going to be OOM and your not going to produce any damage after that happens.  And Crits/Crips aren't every hit, you know this right?  without shaman dex buffs I'll probably crit 2 to 4 times in a fight.  Ok so enough about crits and pets...<P>I never said Invis is an SK only ability, I'm really restraining myself right now, because there is a lot here I could flame.  You along with many others lose credibility because you deny EVERY claim I have.  FACT: A warrior has to pay for invisibility if he doesn't have a certain piece of Cobalt armor (which I do not, nor do I know anyone that does) FACT: An SK doesn't have to pay for invisibility, its a spell that he has, free, castable anytime he wants limited only by his manapool.  Sure it won't get you past every single mob, but its FAR from useless and you KNOW this but of course, you can't give me ANY ground so you will STUPIDLY deny that it has use in the game.  I know someone else on this board who stubornly refuses to acknowledge that anyone else could possibly be correct and him wrong, and his name starts with Tho too...  <P>Fact is your statement was that level is the deciding factor in who pulls regardless of class.  And another statement was that SK's are never allowed to FD pull.  Both are so clearly wrong.  I'm a very competent warrior, with a very stable connection.  When I'm in pickup groups in Karnors or Seb or Chardok, its not uncommon at all for me to pull.  And I'm only lvl 52.  I was pulling in Karnors at level 50.  I've had higher level tanks in my groups that were happy to have me pulling.  In the raid group that I join fairly often they have a monk that pulls, just made lvl 59 a few days ago, but he was pulling at lvl 56 for some big raids.  And a 57 SK that pulls.  Now that raid group has 59 and 60 warriors in it, you know why they don't pull?  Because we don't want 4 or 5 unmezzable Kael giants that hit for 380 a pop that the warriors would bring because he has no way of pulling just one or two.  The Monk SK team are great at their job, and I marvel at them when they work, its real art that I admire.  Its a shame you won't ever know that level of play because seemingly you don't want to admit that you can.  Just because your imagination is limited in scope doesn't mean the class is limited as well...<P>My arguement, whether you want to listen to it or not is that Hybrids aren't going to be made equals to warriors in melee, nor should they ever be made equal to warriors in melee because they have many abilities that make up for their lack of specialization.  You and many others want to deny that you have any advantages over a warrior, but I know that is simply not true.  Neither of us can solo well, but you can travel much safer than I, surely thats worth something.  You state you want potions that give you AC, HP?  Any shaman would be overwhelmed with joy to make those for you.  And they'd charge you a fortune for them too.  Potions already exist that increase your AC, HP, even attack speed and regen.  Tell you what, I'll offer you a counter proposal.  You give up all your spells and get an increase in AC, HP and some of my attack skills...  Oh wait, you'd be a warrior then and you despise that don't you?  Or maybe you only want to give up your spells and stuff for the uber boss mobs, then get them back after that?<P>I think the biggest problem is people coming here crying about how much their class sucks.  Then that starts to seep out to the public imagination and soon people simply fail to see their abilities because their perception is clouded by the veil of lies spread on this message board.  Look at how many clerics say their class sucks.  I play a lvl 51 cleric and he don't suck, not at all.  You keep on telling me I'm a whiner and a cry baby?  How do you figure when I'm not asking for one god damn thing, your the one saying that you need more of my abilities.  When you get them as you are with this next patch probably, you say its not enough you want more more more.  Boy I don't know what part of the nation you come from but from where I'm sitting I see a whole lot more crying from your end of this table.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>an addendum to my statements about invisibility.  This is assuming the person is attempting to get somewhere without aid, soley on his own power.  Of course thats not every sitaution, but it happens often enough to make it a valid point.  I couldn't even afford invis potions till I got to lvl 50.<P>And invisiblity is not the only spell that makes life easier for sk's and rangers.  Snares, self buffs, sight enhancers, the list is pretty big.  None of that matters evidentaly.  From what I hear you guys saying they may as well take all that away from you because you can't tank one mob at the end of a dungeon.  /boggle  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/eek.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sorry to burst your bubble, but Paladins do not solo, and the few that do don't do it efficiently or because it's better than grouping.  Your comparison with this Pally guildmate of yours is pretty poor.  You don't add any credibility to it by not listing why you have such little HP (or why he has so much), the same thing with levels and AC.  To only have that small AC and HP difference is a pretty sad setup you got going on, that, or you've got a 60 Pally that focuses on these attributes.<P>Funny, I see Cobalt pieces save the Bracer and God drops being sold in East Commons all the time.  Same can be said of Deepwater.  You never see Cobalt drop?  Funny, during my leveling from 51-60, I've only seen one Deepwater Bracer and 2 Helms drop - all that for my time spent strictly in Karnors and Sebilis.  Guess what, I had to buy the rest.<P>We all have trade offs.  So you can't outtaunt a hybrid?  Well, I can outtaunt you on sub55 mobs, but I can't outtank you by a far margin.   Now think of raid situations where you own the mobs do to your superior stats and skills.  Outtaunting something off a Warrior isn't something any Raid participant with a brain wants to do.  So don't have hissy fits over things that really don't matter when it comes down to it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>Ailbe said:<P>Look lets just see if we can agree on a few things. <P>**sure why not**<P>1) Warriors are masters of melee. Other classes may be able to outshine them in one area, but no one matches their overall performance. For that they sacrafice a lot, but some (myself) consider it worth while. Most warriors are pretty happy with the class (I love it), and for good reason admittedly.<P>**Um.. you mean no one will outshine their overall performance in non magical melee damage dealt and absorbed...... in performance in groups and uber mobs all classes should be balanced...<BR>(advantages to every class)<BR>hybrids should be lesser only in that they cant slice AND dice and take it as long as a warrior can...  this does not mean they shouldnt be close in some areas, and superior in other ways or against specific mobs by using their spells and granted abilities.  Hybrids should not be more powerful overall now either due to the XP peanlty being removed.**<P><BR>2) Hybrids are not masters of melee. But to compensate somewhat they are gifted with abilites which DO help them, more than some like to admit. The lack of those abilities makes some keenly aware of how much they are taken for granted by those that have them. While they don't contribute directly in combat all the time, they contribute to the overall enjoyment of the class, be that Ranger, Paladin, SK, and Bard (though I don't really consider Bard a hybrid - I guess they are) <P>**Hybrids do have some nice abilities....  but they are frosting on a melee base..... (play a hybrid, you'll see what I mean)  Note please, with all the lies I dispelled before, it seems the warrior community thinks much of certain spells which do very little...  and the warrior community doesnt seem to be figuring out that the hybrids are pointing at MAJOR abilities which make hybrids pointless under most real post-50 situations while warriors point at minor "toys" the SK can do and only under the most specific of situations.<BR>Come on man.. after 50 levels I assume you know how to play your class....  try assuming the same for me...  If you think you can do it better than the old-school SKs, then I suggest you write a guide and publish it for the rest of us...**<P>3) Hybrids are far from worthless, indeed able to contribute on several levels to any group they join (If they know how to play their class properly) Face it there are clueless people that play every class.<P>**We are not worthless...  I dont see a single post that said we were worthless on every group or situation....  In pickup groups and solo we are quite useful, but the best loot and the best fun is when you are in a tight packed group or medium to large raid deep in Sebilis, deep in Skyshrine, battling dragons, or wherever the danger is the greatest...  Warriors are also quite good at pickup groups, and solo just fine....  why is it my SK is a poor replacement for that 13th warrior on an uber mob hunt??  When was the last time your guild hunted for a RARE SK or Pally or Ranger for ANY uber mobs hunt?  Certainly you want to bring a warrior or two... but shouldnt you bring a pally for a unholy abomination??**<P>4) Hybrids needed some help, they were less than they should have been. Fortunately Verant did away with that ridiculous exp penalty, and now bumping up a needed skill and adding some good spells to help out. (though I seriously think that rangers didn't need offense bumped to max, but a balanced moderate improvement to both off/def)<P>**Hybrids and warriors need to be balanced so that both are equal in usefulness overall**<P>5) (this is the major debated point) Hybrids can't be made the equals to warriors in melee. If they are they should sacrifice something of their casters abilities. Similarly they can't be made the equals of their caster parent class, without sacraficing something of their melee abilities.<P>**Hybrids give up specialization and flexability in melee...<BR>this means that we give up either Defense or offense right now on test....  I would prefer to see a return to the balance offered at 50...  <BR>Warriors were betrre in everything, but not by so large a margin as to make Hybrids to either be walking MISS! factories, OR to make it so ONLY a warrior was good enough for EVERY big raid.  WAR/SK/PAL were heavy tanks, and Rangers were medium tanks.<P><BR> Balance doesn't mean you get whatever you want, it has to be brought in line with over all game. Which means (to me at least) not just combat, and DEFINITELY not just combat with Uber Boss Mobs. But the overall package of a class in the whole game of EQ. Which means getting to the combat, and even just walking around a zone for the fun of it. I Know that the designers of EQ don't think of it as "just" a combat engine. I can't imagine they would make adjustments based solely on that<P>**most of the SK who have posted dont want the world, and most SK also have warriors to boot..<BR>I dont want my warrior useless either..  um what do you do for fun most fo the time post 50?  I am usually attempting to adventure deep in Dungeons, or get in an uber mob hunt....  I dont consider killing greenies or running through a zone fun...<BR>why isnt there ONE single uber mob that SK or Pal or Ranger is BETTER at killing than a warrior??**<P>6) at least for me, I'm in the game for friends and fun. I don't care that one class may be more efficient than another in a certain instance. I care that my friends are happy and having fun. <P>**So your hybrid friends dont count? why would you care if hybrids are buffed then?  your hybrids friends can participate more and be more effective....  you have the assurance that Verant will maintain Warriors supremecy in the melee area, while they rebalance everyone...<BR>then why all the fuss??<P>BrikBludgaard you lose all credibility in so many places. You take everything that is *possible* with a warrior and make it the standard. Meanwhile you negate every advantage Hybrids have as negligible and irrelevant. Good job on a useless post.<P>**hmm thats a nice sweeping statement <BR>(and thus most of it is false) <BR>you were unable to read my post as it was prolly too long for your attention span...<BR>My credability is actually superior to yours...  I play BOTH classes... you have never played a SK.<BR>I only dispelled lies...  go through again and actually TRY to refute my points...  do you know how to debate??  I only picked out the lies and pointed out that in real practice, certain SK talents were MUCH less useful than Warriors who have never played a SK seemed to think....<P>If you do not know how to debate... ask please, I can probably teach you.. perhaps we can actually squeeze some intelligent points from you...  start by using copy/paste and refute my points with experience and fact...

</FONT><HR>Well, I had heard on this thread that hybrids really cant solo much better than warriors. So I decided to do a test. I had already a troll sk with full darkforge and jboots and some jewelry on a server i sorta quit a while back. He was lvl 16 at the start of the evening. I hung out in EC and bought him a mace of shadowed soul for 5k pp plus mith staff (i sold all my warrior stuff who'd been my primary on this server -- hadnt played there for a few months). So anyway with minimal effort -- say a 20k pp -- i had my trolly equipped.<P>I made 4 lvls in overthere in 6 hours. Just cut through stuff. I figure I can get to 30 by the end of the weekend with fd and gather shadows. If I really wanted 50 in 2 weeks max, all soloing. Not a group touched. And thats the difference: if I really wanted to solo a warrior I couldnt, even with much more expensive twinking, theres just no way to recover hps efficiently. Now, I know i'm giving an example of twinking, and usually I dont twink, but I just wanted to see what was possible. I'm pretty sure that with enough plat you could twink an sk to 50 in 12 days played.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wither, what exactly is your point?<P>Solo ability does equate to power in Everquest.<BR>If that were the case, Shadowknights would be the best tank and necros would be the best caster.<P>Because you can solo at level 16 as a SK, it doesn't mean that you can tank Trakanon, Dain or Yelinak. Or what about hasted Sirens that double hit for 300. When a hybrid tries to tank in these situations they are referred to as walking corpses.<P>If you want to level up a SK to 50 all solo, go for it. The time taken will probably be about the same as steady grouping getting a warrior to 50.
