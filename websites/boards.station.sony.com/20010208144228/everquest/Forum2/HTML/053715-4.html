</FONT><HR>First off im sure absor hasn't left us theres tons to read...Anyhow, on to my rambling.<BR>OK Wizards have always been considered the "masters" of quick and large amounts of damage. This is obviously now incorrect, and I have been told by many ubber friends that we have become obsolete in high lvl mob kills and raids. Enchanters, Shamans, and Mages with pets can outdamage us and do it in less time too. So why not give us one spell at each lvl above 49, kinda like upgrading Ice Commet each time. Have each one consume a little less mana too. Personally I would love to have more "quick" stunns (ie. less than a 2.5 sec cast and a 2-4 sec stunn would be good) at mid levels (30-45) because they help the enchanters when they are re-mezing a mob, and can help a cleric if the taunts arent working fast enough. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok,<BR>I hear lots of wizards wanting to be more powerful and not focusing on balanceing.<BR>One balancing issue is the whole idea of a wizard, its to be a group-reliant damage-dealer. What i have found is at later levels the magician beats us our horridly in damage with their AE rain spells, totally destroying the objective of a wizard. I think having no back-up to rely on is just emphisizeing the need to be in a group, BUT, no group wants us and when that happens we TRY to solo which leaves us wiggleing like a little puppy with fright while a monster bears down on us. All i can see to Fix this is to make us deal more damage and to fix our spells to be more efficient. The "BLINK" idea, posted by Absor, I think is neat, but not totally neccesary because we need to be in a group. Maybe if we get a new concept spell like a "Wall" spell which does damage to creatures standing in it for a longer time then a rain spell.(i really doubt that change can be made without other classes complaining.) Or maybe make wizards the "Escape" class with all their roots and evacuates and maybe give them a spell that does AE root or snare, or even a line of "Push-Back" spells like invert gravity instead of the usual stun. <BR>OR<BR>Do the simple thing and just balance us with giving us increased damage and make us the undisputed Damage dealers with maybe a discipline that makes us deal more damage.<P>-Deiwos of Quellious-<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Clerics are the masters of healing, they get a 15% bonus to all healing spells. Could Wizards get a 15% bonus to all damaging spells ?<P>A lore spell. We are masters of knowledge, maube a group spell that allows all party members to be more effective versus the target. "Warriors, strike the scaly's beast are underside, enchanters the beast is easily regaled by spells cast just so, mages this beast is the enemy of the element water !" A group buff that adds 10% to all the damage people do or maybe instead reduces it<P>An anti-summon group buff, "only I teleport people in this group foul beast"<P>Ring spells to take out yard trash. MANY targets, wide range of effect but 100% resisted by mobs that provide experience. Just about any other class can push there way through (all hybrids, pet classes,healers and melee - all but maybe enchanter) low greens but every bit of mana is too precious for a wizard to nuke such small obstacles. <P>If not the above maybe Arcane Aura , a spell that prevents non-experience giving monsters from aggroing on a non-attacking Wizard at all.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I like the idea of giving wizards some kind of assistance like pets. what i have in mind however would be some sort of summoned "sword of flame". Summoned with the proper spell it could be "remote controlled" with a special skill in addition to normal melee skills and spellcasting, doing base damage + 1 per lvl or so.It could auto-attack and return to the wizard once the target is killed. then he can send it out to engage the next target. Create "commands" like /sword attack or /sword return<BR>Guess that would look quite cool on screen, too...<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Been playing a Wiz for a while and have noticed some things (forgive if I've reiterated something)<P>There are ways to work around many of the failings of wizards (not that there are many) but the one thing that consistently cries out for attention is Area of Effect spells<P>their damage:mana is excellent. and their casting cost is fair (save for Al'Kabor but that's been discussed), range is good, even the limited targets is fine with me. but I never use them because they always get me killed. There are some rare instances that they can be used without pulling too much aggro but in general I find them wasteful.<P>solution: I saw a post on the warrior thread that brought a tear to my eye. Someone suggested that Warriors get an AoE taunt. Even just a tiny one would be a tremendous help to wizzies using AoE and would open up a whole new (albeit dangerous) tactic for groups. If a warrior could give a little taunt at point blank AoE I could slip a couple a Pilars of Fire in there or a lightning storm with out my finger twitching over the gate hotkey.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>(Small) Eureka:<P>I like doing "in case of emergency" damage and then don't mind sitting out, because I am very broad with my definition of "emergency" (it's anything that will interrupt a group's pulling flow, not just anything that will kill the group).  Some wizards think they should be doing "routine" damage: moderate damage to all mobs, but being able to sustain such casting for long periods of time (hence the requests for "self-only clarity" effects of some sort).<P>My proposal--two new types of blast, to be added to whatever spell rank wizards start seriously lagging in both emergency and routine damage (early post-50 levels is my intuition):<P>Type I--"Sprinting"<BR>Damage: Huge.  Enough to put us back in our glory days of doing around a third of a standard xp mob's hit points.<BR>Cast Time: Fast.<BR>Refresh Time: Minimal.<BR>Mana Efficiency: The downside of the spell--not impressive.<P>This is the spell type which allows us to blow the holy hell out of mobs in an emergency, despite the ramping up of hit points.  (I'm not talking about +32k-hp ubermobs, but rather typical xp-group fighting.)  We sacrifice mana efficiency for insanely fast and lethal damage.  I leave the precise definition of "insanely fast and lethal" to game designers.<P>Type II--"Long-Distance Running"<BR>Damage: Middle of the road.<BR>Cast Time: Decent.<BR>Mana Efficiency: The good part--Simply amazing.  these would be the most mana-efficient non-AE spells wizards would get.  Close to, perhaps on par with or even better than, DoT spells.<BR>Refresh Time: The downside--I envision these spells as taking at least 15 seconds to refresh, possibly longer.  The idea being we can cast only one, or maybe two, per pull.<P>This is the spell type which allows us to continuously deal moderate, efficient damage in a standard xp'ing group, without sniveling about how low we are on mana.  The long refresh time exists to ensure that we can continuously contribute a group which pulls a stream of low blues, but can't chain-cast the spell to take maximum advantage of the efficiency.<P>My thought is that these two spells allow for both an improvement to our current "kill this now" ability, and an improvement to our endurance, without radically changing any game mechanics, without making Harvest a "lay hands" ability, and without really affecting the spells we would want to cast soloing.  <P>I'm also pretty sure most players will hate this idea, so I think I might be on to something  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>  Thank you for letting everyone know that you are reading, or at least skimming, the posts that are being made, Absor.  It is nice to know that our opinions are being listened to.  I am sure we would all like for you to post more frequently so that we can “discuss” things more, but it is understandable that your time is very, very limited at the moment.<P>  Okay, on to the subject matter.<P>  Wizards, as has been said numerous times already, are a very specialised class.  With this high level of specialisation, we expect to be vastly superior to other classes at what we do.  However, we are not.  Well, not to a great extent.  We are on a rough parity with Druids in regards to teleporting, they have more ports and some great locations, but we get some really nice ones as well.  Northern Ro for example.  So I have no problem with ports, apart from those with high risk involved, but that has been covered earlier.  Our other main ability, DDs, is where we should truly stand separate from every other class.  Yet we don’t.  Our spells are better.  For the most part doing a little bit more damage with faster cast times and reduced mana costs, but the advantage is not enough.  Considering everything that has been sacrificed by the wizard class to “specialise” in DD spells, we are not good enough to justify it.  Several things have been suggested about how to remedy this.  From increased damage to reduced mana cost and increased mana regeneration.  Personally, I would prefer the reduced mana cost or, even better, improved mana regeneration.  Increased damage would be nice, but it would not stop you going out of mana very quickly and getting back into the fight quicker.  The problem with increased damage and the reduced mana cost is that both would make wizards much better at soloing.  This might not be a very good thing, but it could be a very bad one.  Of the three ideas, increased mana regeneration is the best.  It would allow you to solo faster, granted, but it would not increase your ability to solo tougher mobs very much.  It would however allow you to contribute more damage during combat and be ready to fight again within a reasonable amount of time.<P>  One idea that has been mentioned that I like a lot was the one about melee resistant targets.  This is a great idea.  It also makes perfect sense.  How is it possible for people to fight with physical weapons creatures and beings that are not truly there?  Think about it.  With creatures like ghosts and spirits, how can a warrior swinging their sword or a monk kicking it or a rogue backstabbing it do any damage to it?  They shouldn’t be able to.  It is a creature of spirit, it doesn’t have a corporeal body for them to damage, so they should not be able to.  In other words, to fight these creatures, you would need spell casting classes.  It would be the only way to fight them.  However, like wizards have lures to cast on “uncastable” mobs, there would be classes and specific weapons that would be able to fight the non-corporeal entities.  The classes I have in mind are paladins and shadow knights.  Both have training in the “supernatural” that would give them the knowledge required to fight them.  However, they would also need specialised weapons to harm the creatures.  Something like a “Ghost Sword.”  This sword would appear as just a hilt and would not be able to hit normal targets, because for them, the sword does not exist.  However, against non-corporeal targets, the sword would work, and extremely well at that.<P>  Another point that is really strange.  Casting mobs.  These mobs are spell casters and yet they can melee as well as a fighter, have thousands of hit points and can also cast spells as well.  The also, I might add, are usually able to summon opponents to them.  Why?  Why do casting mobs have high hit points?  Especially “pure” casters.  They shouldn’t.  They should be a lot weaker physically than their melee counterparts.  To have them otherwise doesn’t make much sense.  Now we come to the casting mobs and their ability to summon opponents.  Again, why?  Why would any spell caster want an opponent closer to them?  Surely it would make more sense to have an inverse-summon opponent for casting mobs?  That way they could send melees away from them.  I realise that this idea probably wont be liked very much, but it would make much more sense.  It would also allow for a reduction in the hit points of caster mobs since they could effectively avoid melee combat for the most part.<P>  On the issue of soloing, wizards have some severe disadvantages to compensate for the high amount of damage that we can do.  One.  You need some form of SoW.  From either another player, a potion, or else journeyman boots.  Without a form of SoW, soloing is much more difficult, if not impossible.  At least I think so.  Two.  You are very, very, vulnerable to attack between fights.  If something comes across you just after a fight and you are low on mana and meditating, there is a good chance you will die.  You have no pet to buy you time to med for a little longer or to make a run for it.  So med time for a wizard is very dangerous and due to the nature of our class, downtime is most of what our time soloing is spent on.  One solution, to help against wandering mobs, would be to cast invisibility on yourself.  However, this doesn’t always help.  With the way zones are now, you are likely to meet both living and undead opponents and you cannot hide from both.  There is also the fact that a lot of monsters can see through invisibility with no difficulty.  So yes, wizards can solo, but it is not as easy as some people think.<P>  One idea that I have been toying with that could help spell casting classes is the ability to split an opponent.  What I mean by this is, is that some mobs have high melee and magical abilities rolled into one.  My idea is that through a spell, a wizard could strip the “magic” from a monster.  This would creature two mobs.  One which was “pure” melee and had 90% of the mobs original hit points and the other which would be a “pure” caster and would have the other 10% of the hit points.  This would allow raids to work more effectively since you could have your spell casters quickly destroy the “magic” of the opponent, this reducing it capacity to harm your people.  What would be left would be an extremely tough physical opponent that could then be dealt with.  Of course, there would be some mobs that you would want to split in such a manner, but for targets up to 100k hit point, it could be very useful.<P>  One issue that is mentioned several times during this talk is our lack of diversity.  For this I have some more ideas for spells, apart from those I have already mentioned earlier.<P>Mirror image.<BR>-Level 4.  This spell would create a duplicate (not shown) of the wizard.  The number of “images” created would be one per every two levels.  Any attack that would succeed in harming the wizard would cause an “image” to vanish.  If the wizard is hit by an area effect spell, all “images” are destroyed.<P>Web.<BR>-Level 39.  This spell would stick a target to the ground, rendering them unable to cast or attack.  The target would be able to try and escape from the web once every twenty seconds or else once for every successful attack.<P>Barring The Gift.<BR>-Level 52.  This spell would stop the target from casting spells or using magical abilities for the duration of the spell.<P>Prismatic Sphere.<BR>-Level 51.  This spell creates a magical shield that greatly increases magic, fire and cold resistances.<P>Prismatic Blast.<BR>-Level 55.  This spell throws a blast of energy formed of the three different types of DDs and the wizard’s disposal, magic, fire and cold.  Each of the three types would be able to do a maximum of 500 damage.<P>Prismatic Storm.<BR>-Level 60.  This creates a storm which is made out of the three elements at a wizard’s disposal, magic, fire and cold.  Each element has the potential to do 800 damage to mobs in its area of effect.<P>  I do have other ideas, but this post is long enough as it is, so I will end it here.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Currently wizard are designed to do magical damage and teleport groups.  When teleport skills gain more noteriety in groups than damage skills you know the class will face grouping trouble.  If someone were to address the issue by increasing damage output, how much of an edge should wizards have in DD over others?<P>If you made the call where would you draw the line? After I asked myself this question thats when I dropped out of the entire class.  By its very nature fast obliterating damage by PCs would be the undoing of EQ because it would reduce the challenge to un-entertaining levels and disenfranchise all of the other classes that could not participate in a meaningful way.<P>Sit back. Close your eyes. What do you think? Wizards sacrifice a lot to become masters of magical damage, but how much is too much? not enough? I don't see any end to the answers for this question.  (pulls an Abashi) It's all subjective wether more is too much or too little.<P>If wizards were empowered to instantly kill mobs for loot and experience, whose to say that would be fun?  VI is keeping the balance. There are couple ways VI can use to tune balance. They can increase each classes power to meet new challenges mob bring and in so doing tip the equiliberium between classes or they can nerf all classes to a preset standard and then nerf the mobs on the backend.<P>The fact is, this class needs a rework. They were designed to do a job they're no longer permitted to do for the sake of balance and group cooperation.  I can understand and appreciate that. Please give them a useful role in groups so they can contribute again to their friends and take their rightful place at that table.<P>Its my guess that all magic based casters feel inferior in comparison to the cleric/war/enc trilogy in the expansions. I hope magics for all casters are balanced with the expansions in mind so they may once again become fun and fruitful. Personally, I await a superior magics system in the next gen RPG, but in the meantime I hope EQ plans to maintain magic as its core. If its not magic, whats so special about it?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<BR>Thanks for your reply!<P>I want to help you understand that from a level 24 perspective, my decision to play a wizzard was a bad one. Additionally I have almost quit playing since I read all of these posts and realized why I was so frustrated with my charachter!<P>I remain hopeful that you will fix our class and maybe add/fix current shortcomings with our class. How about the following suggestions.<P>1. Quest for lvl 20+<BR>A Wizards Cone  (We Identify with the hat)<P>2. Remove the sight spells because they aren't useful for anything, at least not to 24, Replace them with new abilities for us in groups.<P>3. Give us ports that we can gain that others don't get. (makes us unique and wanted)<P>4. Give us faster mana regen that we can cast on ourselves (Another Self only spell).<P>5. Remove O'kills me radiation and  replace it with a spell that takes our lvl, multiplies it by our mana lvl and gives us a boost in AC, this way we have a mana shield while fighting, but the more we use, the less damage it absorbs.<P>5. Give us a magical sword that looks invisible, with a glow that only mages can hit with. This would be something we could use when fighting MOBs with high MR.<P>6. Did I mention the pointy hat?<P>7. AND A REALLY KEWL SPELL YOU COULD GIVE US, the ability for us to send a MOB to oblivion, or somewhere else across the zone, this would be good for randomness in the zone, and would be good for clearing out a dungeon on a corpse run. This would make us desired as much as a clerics res when someone would need a rescue deep in a dungeon. THAT WOULD ROCK! Of course we wouldn't get experience for sending him across the zone  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>8. Give us the ability to evac our group to our bind point. This would rock also. Druids can't do this! Being a master of travel this should be kewl.<P>That a few suggestions. I'll post more if I think of them  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Siasil the worthless tanking wizard  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

What if wizards were to get some bonus when low on hp or mp. Say we regen 3x as fast if we're below 2 bubs on mana? or do Extra damage when we're lower on mana/health. Just something along those lines would work.<BR>Warriors frenzy becaues they are the masters of Melee, Wizards frenzy because we are the masters of magic.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Did a little math during an outing in Ill Omen. FYI - group is 18-20, except me at 21. Pullin 5-6 gobbies at a time, I (the wizard) was out damaged consistently by the warrior and rogue in the group. My damage output was closely matched my both paladins in group, even when they helped cleric heal warrior and rogue. Cleric did not do as much damage, but was able to melee in between heals to help knock down mobs faster. By the end of the fight I am oom. Healer and Pallys are about 40%. Everyone is ready to fight but has to wait for me (the wizard) to med.<P>While medding group secretly wonders why they invited a wizard when they could have had a druid that does 90% of DD, PLUS can melee to conserve mana, cast SoW on the tank to save hp when puling, throw in some heals when needed, and give everyone damage shields and buffs.<P>Now take it one step further. Group pulls while I med. I cast every time I have enough mana for a nuke. Damage totals now? Everyone including the cleric has done more damage than I have over time. Pallys and cleric are low on mana, but I am oom (remeber, trying to help, casting every chance I get).<P>That druid is really starting to look good now!<P>Don't get me wrong, I LOVE my wizzy, its my primary. But we need to be more group friendly. need better mana/damage ratio. Need faster mana regen. Need useful damage shields, unlike O'Kiels useless line of spells. Need better upgrade to root, enstill is a joke, it is resisted more than root is. We need a reason for groups to want wizards like they want druids, enchanter, and clerics. Or for that matter every other class. I am not suggesting huge changes, but adjustments to make wizards more desirable in groups.<P>/rant off<P>Wandor Kilbringer<BR>Wizard of 22 seasons</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here's a idea of making harvest more usefull and migth go someway to fixing problems econtered with vleious huge hp mobs.. k the way harvest curently works is that u can cast it like aprox every 10 mins and get about 3/4 of a buble back depending on your mana and level now lets say they made harvest work so that the longer you left the icon up the more mana whould be retuned to you when u cast harvest .... so if a wizard saved his harvest iceon for say 30 minutes hed get a full bar of mana so the next time hes fighting a uber 100 k hp mob he basicly can have 1 bar of mana in reseve any one have any thoughts on this? bear in mind he isnt geting any extra man that he wouldnt of had had he used his harvest icon as it poped hes just stored it...giving him more mana in reserve.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Thought I'd add more about my Increase when low on hp/mana Idea. You would make it regen faster when below 2 bubs because you would still want to regen full. So people wouldn't go below 2 bubs purposely. This would allow us to put out more damage. and also once we put out the damage, give us enough time to prepare for an evac.<BR>     But if you want to increase damage when low on health. You could just make it 2x damage when below a bubble of hp. This would allow you to when you're getting beat bad (this happens often) to throw a spell and hightail it. Possibly give us a 10 sec stun spell to get the hell out and or throw all we have before we meet are unending doom. This would make us a formidible force even if we don't get into groups. Even though if we were in a group we are no longer a useless exp vaccum.<P>I feel this would balance the uselessness of the high hp mobs and the wanting of a group of a wizard. (12 wizard) I'm already seen as an exp magnet and can't get past this without help from others</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Speaking from a 54th level wizard perspective and over 120 days game days played since March, 1999. I have a lot of trouble with what most of the younger wizards are talking about. Personally pre 50, and if I am in the "Old World" pre Kunark. I will own any mob anywhere at my current level, except a dragon or some of the mobs for the Epic Quest. I can do a ton of damage in a short amount of time, and I can KS any other group if they don't have a wizard in that group. In the old world I am basically what Verant said a wizard is. One on one I can KS any other class in the game 70% of the time in old world dungeons. I very seldom solo'd to boring and I have better things to do than what a necro or druid is breed for.<P>When Kunark came out, I had trouble with the new mobs. Some where higher than 50th and I was a young wizard compared to a lot of the mobs I ran up against. I grew up a bit and got a lure spell and I was doing great. Then VI played with the Lure spells and I felt I had lost quite a bit of power in raid situations and high level encounters. They tried to fix it, Still not what it was but o.k. whatever. I can adapt to it.<P>Then SoV came out. I was very excited with what was in the new expansion. A better interface, improved graphics, more mobs, tons of places for 50th level plus characters to adventure. But I noticed over the last few months that my Power that I once felt flow through my little fingers when I played this game, has gone almost entirely. I feel weak, I feel like I was in my 30's going into lower guk and getting the living daylights beat out of my power little high elf butt. Sure I can cast Ice comet that does 1120 damage to a mob, but most mobs in SoV are VERY COLD RESISTANT.  So I started to use my draughts and they worked o.k. but didn't do near as much damage as I was accustomed to in the year that I have had the "uber spell of the old world" Ice Comet. Well I got use to casting draughts twice as much as the old trusty Ice comet, and have dealt with it since. Only problem with that is now the mobs have twice or more hitpoints and I am casting the spells that where made for Kunark and old world mobs and I do half the damage or less respectively. This is very disconserting to a lot of us wizards.<P>Things I think that need to be looked at and fixed:<P>Invis vs Undead - Leave it or get rid of it, I don't care. I don't use it unless I am running something down to a newbie in LG anyway<P>Root / Enstill / Atol's - Leave them the way they are we are fine with them. Makes the soloing wizards more cautious and die more. Which they should they get more exp for less effort.<P>AE''s - Take the darn pets out of the waves or add a few more waves. If you add more mobs, who the heck cares. I don't want to do that. I want to kill the 3 mobs that are there faster. I cool thing would be allowing wizards to focus the AE's on fewer mobs.<P>Gaze / Glimpse - Hardly use them and don't plan on changing. I am pretty sure we are hosed on this issue unless VI redoes the engine.<P>Fade / Yonder / Shadowstep - Only use them to Duel and I haven't done that in a long time.<P>Cazic Gate - Leave it there, and have the younger wizards stop whinning about it. At 54th I can gate in invis and be off to my buisness. At 34th, I better have had a full group waiting for me there. No need to change it, it weeds out the dense players quickly.<P>WK Portal Location - Move it for Mith Marr's sake. I agree with a post I read, about if wizards are so intelligent why did they make 2 portals so close together. Are you folks sure at VI that you didn't get WK Backwards when you made it? I don't care if I port onto a pryamid or into a farmers field.<P>Graphical spell effects - o.k. who the heck cares, I only want to see the damage message followed by wizard_00001 has killed a xxxxxx mob. Work on something of substance not frill please.<P>Tishan's relocation - All I can say on this is, Damn. Reminds me of porting to CT when I was in my mid 30's. All I can say is you better be ready for the hurt, and you better have Sow or your J-boots kicked before doing this one.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Harvest - bascially worthless post 53rd. This spell desperately calls for a upgrade at 54th / 55th. This would help a ton for us in the area of mana.<P>Damage - What most of us wizards want is more damage. But I disagree with anyone wanting these spells to work in Old World. High level wizards rule old world hands down, Period. What we need is a SoV only damage spell that casts like IC but does 5 fold the damage and is Magic, Fire, Lightning based. You would think if Dragons are all knowing for the most part and live in an ice world they would have come up with spells that work on mobs that resist cold based spells. And getting something at 60th is just insane. There are a ton of mobs 50 to 59th that would have a spell like this. And who cares about PVP, make it only work on non PVP servers then, or against NPC's or something.<P>Mana - I think we are fine on mana, What I would love to see is an upgrade / respecialization to allow us to become better at the spells we have, starting post 50.  What do we really do with the training points after 50th besides start some trade skills we never bothered with before that. If wizards are "Seekers of Knowledge" we would have come up with better ways to use our mana for spells we knew for 10 to 40 levels.<P>Balacing - Wizards don't fit well into Post 50's groups in SoV or high level groups in Kunark.  The mobs have to many hit points for us to do much good. When I am fighting a  boss mob that has old world Hp's and I unload a full bar of mana on it, I can take it down about 1/3 of it's health. That is pretty impressive when I do 10k worth of damage in 30 seconds and the mob will die fairly quickly.  Now if I am in SoV, heheeh, I am going to unload on it, maybe scratch it, if I don't get mega resisted and I am almost assured of dieing. If I don't die, well I am medding back up for another single cast and then medding, and on and on and on. Meanwhile the tanks, which are the new damage kings, are up to their armpits in blood and gore getting their licks in and getting heals from Clerics, rebuffs from chanters, getting healed and speeded up from bards. Mages are nuking and then medding and their pet is doing damage similar to a Warrior. Necro's are mana batteries for the chanters and clerics and sucking life from the mobs. And the poor stupid stick with it wizard is sitting on his / her well worn robe butt medding like they always do on Post 55th level mobs. Why is it that all other caster classes have something to do in battle besides sitting on their collective rear ends for 3/4 of the fight. Let me do anything. Have an uber spell like someone mentioned that only wizards can channel the other casters into to do an Uber nuke. Let me have a group harvest that stuns me for 30 seconds and gives mana to every caster in group and stamina to tanks. Just please let me do something in group so I don't feel like I am worthless 30 seconds into a boss mob fight or a huge pull.<P>Basically all I want is the power and feeling I felt when I was near the top in the food chain in the old world, and not a nice crumb for a greenie to much on because the mob has to many hit points and I don't have enough mana to kill a darn worthless greenie.<P>I really think Verant fubar'd EQ with all of the twinking on the other classes. They allowed tanks to be CH'd to no end which made the mobs weaker. Then having to fix that they made the mobs have tons of hit points to compensate for that insanity. Which in turn made out spells that where the king of Damage in the old world seem like spit wads to the new world.<P>All I can say is I hope someone at Verant reads this long gripe and it makes one of them think about what is going on.<P>my 2cp<BR>Salena Crimsonheart<BR>54th Level Wizard<BR>Tunare Server<BR>120+ days played<BR>Tunare Trade Coalition</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I have played a wizard since Emarr was brought up. Currently 99% of my time is fighting ubermobs, so thats all I am going to comment on.<BR>1) Fix Harvest. I know its already been repeated 100x, but it needs to scale better at 60. I have 200+ int and +795mana in my normal setup. Harvest gives me LESS THAN half a bbl of mana back. Not worth the spell slot currently.<P>2) Fix Concussion. Concussion needs to be unresistable like malo/tash. It also needs to remove a bit more hate per cast. Verant sayd wizards are about fast damage. Stopping between each nuke to cast this 2-3 times != fast.<P>3) Fix Rains. 2 items here. Remove pets as targets so we are a bit more group friendly with necros/mages. Also, please check that the rains are going through the correct path to calculate resists. From common use, rains get resisted/partialed far more often that straight dd nukes.<P>4) Fix Lures. Unless a mob is 100% resistant to the type of lure you are using, it should always hit him for max regardless of the mobs level. You also need to check the casting range bonus on this spell. On most large velious ubermobs (Zlandicar, etc), melee can be whacking on the mob from way back, but wizards have to be under the mob to have a chance for lure to hit. If you cast from where the melee swing, you get 100% resist every time.<P>5) Fix Pet. An easy way to fix this guy is to make him completely immune to mr/cr/fr/dr/pr. That way he is useful on raids but won't tank for a wizard in a soloing situation. Also, it would be nice if he summoned in a bit higher level. Level 30s pet vs lvl 70 uber mob == whiff whiff whiff whiff whiff...<P>6) Fix Manaskin/Epic. Minor stacking issue with other minor forms of mana regen (Druid's grove spell).<P>-= Suggested improvements =-<P>1) I see a lot of complaints that wizards want something special to offer their groups. How about something like:<BR>Dimensional Block<BR>1 sec cast time<BR>50 mana<BR>Effect: Interrupts mobs gate 100% of the time.<BR>Notes: this would not work against ubermobs.<P>An effect like this would make wizards useful in a sebilis/chardok setting where mobs gating then summoning is feared by groups.<P><BR>2) Add a disc to the wizard class at level 60. "Channel Elements". 3 min length / 30 min reuse. During this time, all cast spells would function on the lure resist table.<P>This ability would specifically help against velious ubermobs w/o strengthening soloing, kiting, etc. <P>As an example (because we just got done killing him) Zlandicar. The fight usually lasts 4 minutes. During this time, our guild rogues are dishing out 80dmg/sec (they parse it all the time). As a wizard, I dump my full load of lures (9) for around 5740 dmg (parsed tonight) (2 were resisted, see the "fix lures" section above). That puts me at 24dmg/sec for the fight. On harder ubermobs with more hp, my ratio drops because I am out of mana, but the melees keep chugging with their xdmg/sec.<P>With this disc in, I could use Ice Spear of Solist to achieve around 50dmg/sec over the course of the fight. A much more fair amount imho.<P>If you wish to discuss any of these in greater detail I will be happy to assist.<P>Sudo [Da`Kor]<BR>Email: sudo@dakor.net<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is a sad predicament.  I doubt Verant will go and double our damage capacity... or half our medding downtime.  <BR>At the same time, our DD capabilities are really nothing spectacular, and fall nicely in line with other classes DDs.  Our only specialty is in the Lure line, and it is really only useful against high-resist mobs (ie. In Raid-type situations).  For pick-up groups, the high level Wizard is out of luck.<BR>THIS is the balance issue.  And frankly, myself and most other wizards don't WANT to be given more group-friendly abilities (ie buffs).  We signed on to be the MASTERS of direct damage.  Instead, we're barely in the lead, and everyone else is given compensatory abilities, pets, buffs, etc.  <BR>It's a true shame.  I think the wizards are perhaps the toughest class to fix.  This is because the only real solution is drastic, and from Verant's track record, the drastic is usually the last thing to happen.  The drastic is frightening, as its implications can be large.  <BR>I love being a wizard, but I see as I move up in levels that, in day-to-day play, I am becoming less and less effective when compared to a mage (or cleric or shaman or or or ...)  <BR>I am asking Verant to make me feel like the MASTER of direct damage again! ... and to make the other classes see that a) We were seriously underpowered post-50, and that b) We can be fixed and made useful and powerful again!! (useful in general day-to-day non-raid play, I mean)...<P>It is important to see that the power of a class is the sum of it's parts.<P>A Mage is PET POWER + DD POWER + SUMMONING POWER = TOTAL POWER ... for the mage lets just arbitrarily say 5 + 4 + 1 = 10<P>A Wizard has DD POWER + PORT POWER + AoE POWER (I guess, not really sure what would be quantified as our "powers")<BR>arbitrarly say 6 + 2 + 0.5 = 7.5<P>This is how I see the "value" of our powers, respectively.  Anyhow, if anyone has a better "model" idea, shoot it out.<P>What I am saying is, look at each class as the sum of its parts (particularly casters) and see that Wizards are out of whack in that aspect.  <P>Also, please don't tell me not to compare to other classes, passing it off as "class-envy" or something, because the idea of balance is comparing one thing to another (ie 2 cups in a scale, that sort of thing).<P>Thank you for reading this,<BR>Take care,<BR>Absydion Darkflame &lt;Bloodmoon Alliance&gt;<BR>44 Wizard<BR>Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>just read Graffe's message board, and I found some good spell idea to balance us(sure wizard I mean), here's some of them with my own ideas.<P>1. Ultra DD: Huge damage(maybe 2000 at level 50), long cast time, long recast time(maybe once per day, just like HT and Lay hand), and fine ratio(like 2000 damage 400 mana). It wont make us to be the god of solo cuz its long recast time, just let us feel that we are true masters of damage, and we can use it to save our lives if needed.<P>2. Uber Mob DD: to solve the uber mob tons of HP issue, this spell has awful ratio (like 500 mana for 5000 damage!) but u can only cast it on the level 60 or above mobs, and long recast time too.<P>3. Big nuke between 49 and 60: if sunstike is the big daddy of Ice comet, the i believed that we need a big brother of IC too. there is no big nuke during 49 and 60, we need something over 1200 damage(same ratio to draught, but the cast time is over 7 or 8)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Okay...  I've thought about this for quite some time now, and I do have to admit that I think the class is in need of a general boost in power at levels beyond 20, or 30 at the very least.<P>It's been said many times that we are the one class that really, *really* needs a group to survive.  To that end our primary role in a group is to zap a monster *fast*.  With the exception of a few rather incredibly common spells like invisibility and levitation, and evac spells (which druids almost seem to get a better deal on, but I think it's an acceptable trade-off considering we get planar travel, even if it's a mixed blessing), we don't have *any* other means of contributing to a group.  We are quite and thoroughly bound by our ability to turn manna into damage.<P>Taking a slightly different approach from the rest of the people here, I'd been trying to figure out why the wizard class exists, _at all_, rather than what it's "defining" role is.  It's what I feel is a more apropos approach to the issue--analyzing the need for a class from a design standpoint.  I *can* agree that having a class which can deal damage significantly faster than the rest is a unique enough concept to warrant the existance of the class, BUT...  with the wizard class, gradually and over time but only *mildly* due to changes to the other classes, the end result is that the concept simply hasn't been properly followed through with completeness.<P>The close proximity in spell damage output that the other pure caster classes (and at some levels where they exceed those of the wizard) makes the existance of their pets *overshoot* balance, and creates a situation where the wizard simply winds up being notably less effective than the other pure caster classes.  It didn't become immediately obvious until the Velious uber-mobs entered the picture, but it is the *same* problem that plagues the class at nearly all levels above 20.<P>Without pets we are *quite* dependent on groups, which is fine considering it's been stated the game is meant for people to play in groups.  However, it's *not* fine that our overall effectiveness makes us the *least* useful to groups.  Druids, shamen, bards, paladins, necros, shadowknights, and even clerics, can in any given fight, perform several *interchangeable* roles because they have a lot of the same abilities, although in differing amounts, so they can be easily fit into a group.  Pet classes can add quite a bit of value simply because they effectively bring an extra *tank* with them, even if it is a somewhat weak one compared to the warrior class.  Two group members for the price of one.  Wizards simply can *not* compete for a spot in a group against that with the spell damage being *sooooo* similar, and having almost no other role we can perform in a given scenario *but* blasting.  All of the wizard's existance is focused down to one thing, and that's nuking, and while we do it faster, we should be doing it a lot *better* than we currently are.<P>Absor, I've seen you say very nearly that much yourself, and while it may pain you guys greatly to do it, you simply must _accept_ that it's the only way to "fix" the class.  We *have* to have groups, but simply don't have what it takes to be useful enough to others to get into groups, so long as there is literally anyone else left in the zone.<P>Now it sounds good and logical in _theory_ that the wizard class is one that should be nearly as necessary as a cleric, in that our ability to do damage quickly lets us take an active role in determining the overall outcome of the fight.  Playing my wizard, if an additional mob shows up, I am ready and quite able to get it to go where I want it, and make it STAY there with Enstill and a DD or two.  With the exception of certain types of mobs, I'm able to effect a change to the fight that makes a serious difference to the outcome.  We're *better* at it than the other classes, but not by enough to make the other classes interested.  Fear gives the same effect, with less control.  Mezmerizing mobs gives a nearly identical effect, and enchanters are outright better at it.  Mages can use pets that can *root* at a relatively early level.  Neither of these classes can do it as quickly, but yet again, it's not much less quickly at _all_.  Their other benefits very strongly offset the minor increase in time used.  We can Evac, but so can druids.  Druids can *also* employ direct damage, DoT, and healing magic.  (I know this seems to be a reiteration of the last paragraph, but stick with me, there's a point to it.)  In *theory* we're useful, and in very specific, pre-planned, and ideal circumstances we can *be* quite essential to a group, as "The Insurance Policy" because we have the greatest (by a very, *very* slim margin) ability to make the *key* changes to a fight scenario to keep a bad skirmish from becoming an absymal rout.  Ours is not the straightforward role of a Big Gun, with magic substituting for swordwork, but that of a player of chess, spotting the key moments where very particular things need to happen (...mob #4 has to go away NOW!  ...party is *clearly* doomed, Evacuate!  ...drop the bomb and *voila* the monster is running for the hills!), and seeing them through.  However, this is not theory, it's an actual game in practice, and players of the game simply do not believe in "Insurance".  Not only that, but probably &gt;95% of the fights in EverQuest are *not* carefully pre-planned, made up of groups of people who have been specially selected for the fight, or are by any measure ideal conditions.  In _theory_ we work, but sadly, *not* in practice, and *that* is why serious changes need to be made to the class.<BR>Our maximum damage output needs to be increased across the board, even if it means getting monsters seriously pissed off at us even more often than they are now, because after all, _every_ class has the ability to keep us in one piece when we overburn (they just gripe about it sometimes).  We need to be able to do more damage across the board from 20 up to get groups.  Period.<P>I *do* have a solution to what I think the Velious uber-mob issue is, based partly on a post on the very first page of this one, and I think it will work, and makes sense from both a tactical perspective AND a role-playing one.  With the entrance of Velious uber-mobs to the game, skirmishes changed from a matter of players effectively doing their maximum damage possible in a nearly fixed amount of time, to how much damage can be dealt over a long period of time.  The wizard class is sooooo shafted (I'm not trying to be rude, but it's the best word to express it that I know of) in the change of gameplay that it's just horrifying.  Over time, with blasting AND meditation taken into effect we max out at somewhere in the neighborhood of just eighteen points per second.  Literally every melee class is capable of this by level 30.  Every class but the wizard is quite capable of this by 40 because they're slinging a sword, or they have a pet who might as well be.<P>Our problem is that we just plain run OUT of manna, which you guys have said you're not willing to increase because it would increase our total damage output.  Well, YES.  That *has* to be done, because classes that _aren't_ completely manna-dependent have *their* total damage output distinctly increased simply because the fights last longer, giving them more time to do the damage.  We can stand with them best of them for about a minute to a minute and a half, and then beyond that, we taper right down to zero damage output, and *stay* there.<P>Now extending the analysis of fights to include those battles that go on for an extended period of time from the start, leads me to believe that possibly an analysis of the time *before* a fight is in order.  If damage over time is the primary focus, then it logically follows that exp gain over time should be looked at as well, and then the answer becomes fairly apparent.<P>It makes complete sense to me that a class which is essentially based on careful planning and flawless execution would be doing something to *prepare* for major battles long before any other class would consider doing so.  That preparation time would very logically be spent *hoarding up manna* since *manna* is our _entire_ stock in trade.<P>The concept of manna storage devices has been breached with the Mage's modulating rod. Apparently the developers decided it was a good one, since it's still here, so I'm not breaking wholly new ground with this, but very simply, wizards should be given the ability to store enough manna to last through a long fight.<P>Give wizards quests for a series of devices which are NODROP and only wizard useable that can store *charges* of bundles of manna, which become drained when they camp, and would perhaps take most if not all of a wizard's manna to give one charge to at a time, with each charge restoring between a 1/5 (early devices) manna to 1/2 manna,<BR>Yes, it is a *grievous* amount of time spent meditating back from nothing to gain a small advantage later, and with this in mind I think the increase in output is quite handily offset by the downtime *before* a fight.<P>Giving the idea a bit more thought (and taking into account what is more likely feasable without massive changes to the game engine) give us a container (or possibly a holdable, but a container seems fine to me) which can hold *charged* NODROP NORENT gems, one or two slots at the lowest level (to increase our damage output enough *at key points and key points only* in keeping with our "Insurance" role), and eight slots at the highest level.  The gems themselves should be reasonably common, and not nodrop when *uncharged*, but a wizard's manna should belong to that wizard alone, so once charged they should be both nodrop and norent (to keep people from casually storing them up while waiting for groups over a period of days, and to keep people from making mules for storing massive stockpiles of wizard manna).  The devices should come at first with quests which are nearly as time-consuming as the Staff of the Wheel (but steer clear of the random drops which require extended camps, common items, but a lot of them, because these devices must necessarily be very magically complex, as the quest for Ice Comet is), and with the highest eight-slot container be as difficult as an epic quest (but not the WIZARD epic quest, which Cazic Skin drops make far far *far* more difficult to achieve than epics of other classes--it should be something we should achieve after massive study and effort, not as a result of a long patient *wait*)  You've got a nice storyline going with the "voices" in stones of Velium, so fill in a little more detail.  This won't scale as for down as I really think it needs to go, but make various sized velium *crystals* available in the game much in the manner of style of various sized chunks of ore, that wizards will gain spells (though RESEARCH ONLY, make us have to use that research skill for this, indeed make the spells nodrop once researched so a wizard must learn it for themselves, since they're storing their own particularly unique manna into gems, and every wizard is different) to modify and empower into the various sizes of nodrop norent manna batteries (heh.  Not the gnomish kind).  With the gems used at the eight-slot level giving back about 1/2 manna, this increases the output of a wizard by five, with the downtime effectively increased by ten, or by *twenty* if you care to add a recast delay similar to harvest to the spell we fill the gems with.  In summary, let wizards do the dramatically higher damage necessary to keep up with the other classes, at the expense of having to spend quite a bit of time *earning* that ability by not being able to engage in fights in any real capacity while wizards, balancing out our ability to gain abnormally high levels of exp from having this extra manna due to the time taken.<P>Now I'm pretty sure I'm over-explaining this by now but I'm going to continue, because I think this is a really winning idea.  Al'Kabor has been running around trying to find they key to eternal life for some time, and the best he has come up with so far are a series of spells which while bigger and more powerful than other similar spells, have shown a distinct tendency to cost an abnormally (and you have to admit, it's enough to make them less valuable overall) high amount of manna for their increased damage output.  Al'Kabor could finally unlock the secret of storing manna (which is as good as our life force, since our hitpoints can be literally measured off in seconds rather than an ordinal number when we're attacked) in velium crystals in his search to extend life to infinity.  It's not *quite* what he was looking for, but he's getting closer... and it would somewhat offset the disheartening amount of manna spells he invents take.  I mean sheesh, clearly Al'Kabor has a different idea of what kind of manna expenditure is appropriate for effective casting than most people, or he wouldn't have felt the spells he invented worthy of teaching to others.  (Heck you could nerf the AoE spells just a tiny bit further to reduce quad-kiting, and offset this *and* rebalance for groups by compensating with the new storage gems without increasing the amount of exp a wizard can gain over time.)<P>It all works for me.  I just hope you guys see it the same way.  So what if we can blast a monster in oblivion that we wouldnt be able to before.  We won't be able to do it but once in 20 or more battles with the amount of time it takes to charge those gemes.   Introducting the smallest containers at 20 or 30 would allow wizards to learn how to manage this new ability over time, because otherwise I can see that the sudden abililty to do a marked amount more damage all at once will result in a *whole lotta* dead wizards until we learn how to deal with it.  Wizards are all about careful planning and manna management already.  Make them have to better at these key skills to increase their own power so they can once again compete.  <P>(A slight variation on this theme which might be more acceptable to the developers as well as a roleplay standpoint would be if we were able to store actual casts of DD spells in these gems instead of manna.  A DD spell is still an expression of the will of the caster, and the life of the caster, in a manner of speaking.  One per gem could basically mean less extra manna, but still a fixed number of extra casts)<P>I think I can pretty much speak for most of us (since we've been trying to get this point across for so long now we've also developed Incredible Patience far beyond the other classes) in saying that if you do implement something like this, we're not going to go ballistic if you have to tweak it repeatedly over the next six months until you think you have it "right".  We've been what you guys consider "balanced and not needing changing" for so long, any attention at all would be nice.  No small change is going to fix us.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm a casual player who in the interest of variety has played many characters, but none very far.  My main is my 24 wiz.  I do spend a time reading the boards and stratagy tips to help make myself more effective for a group.  <P>I'm not sure why it has been decided that wiz's for sure will get no more mana or spell power.  <P>Reading the boards I have many times heard the response that our faster casting time and better mana effeciancy was why we were still damage kings though the damage numbers of other casters was similar. <P>While I admit, faster casting time is nice on occasion, the majority of the time (and based on other comments in this thread it's not just me) I am rationing my shots for good effect and less chance of agro.  Speed really isn't much of a factor.  <P>I've spent time watching my party fight nice high reds while I either sit around, or whack the baddy with my staff for 5 points (rather useless even at low levels) because I could not affect the creature.  <P>The priest types heal/buff the casters, and the other casters send in their pets.  I cast O'Kiel's just for something to do.  Of course it is usually overwritten by someone else's damage shield.<P>I tested the gaze line, and have never used it again.  I sometimes use the eye for fun, but it draws a lot of fire from mobs.<P>I don't really wonder why I'm not sought after as a party member.  I can't even evac yet.<P>Soloing is possible, but really not much fun as it takes most of my bar to kill one low blue. And then it's a loooong wait. <P>I've already made this longer than I wanted, and I want to do more than just echo complaints which have come before.  But a lot of the answers I see to why things are a certain way don't seem to relate to at least my lower level game play, and by listening to discussion on the boards, not to some of the higher level game play as well.<P>I don't think a doubling the mana is necessary, though more would be nice.  I think it might be a viable solution to reduce casting costs of some spells, especially those mostly designed for use in Vellious.  If the 55+'s are mostly hunting the high level ubermobs, why can't the higher level dd spells have lower casting costs? More spell casting, no mana change.<P>I saw one comment for wizards being able to use swords.  That would be an interesting addition to the repetoir which could be balanced for greater or lesser effectiveness. Doubt it will happen, but would add some choices.  (I don't think many wizzies would choose that as their first avenue.  Otherwise why play a wiz)<P>I do think that wizzies should have something to contribute to a party hunting high reds (above six levels).  Doesn't have to be tons, but something.  In order not to have to create something(like swords), you could remove the six level cap, you would still have high resists, and frequently lower damage.  Even trying to kill something 5 levels above, my spells usually only hit for about half their normal strength. I would think this wouldn't throw the balance out of whack.  <P>I imagine damage shields are not something to be considered for wizzies, though possibly something like a shieldskin you could cast on others might be viable.<P>I have been able to be effective as a wizard most of the time.  However, there are  times I've logged off unable to find a group, or sat watching as my party battled a creature I could not touch. <P>These are things I would describe as balance issues.  Other classes can contribute in situations where I can't.  Not just can't contribute the way I would like to, but can not contribute at all.  And fighting a mob six levels above with a full group is not that unusual.<P>Sorry this was so long, but thank you for your time and effort in this matter.<P>24 level wiz<BR>Brell<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Personally I play a 42nd level wizard, To be honest, up to date, with a few exceptions I have to say I enjoyed the experience, And I have to admit I have found that the balance is pretty good. When in a group, I believe that making a meaningfull contribution is mostly a question of finding a balance between the tanks hit points and your mana. And timing your stikes to actually mean more than just extra damage, On that subject, there are some wonderfull players guides that have been written, so I won't go into that.<P><BR>There are a few things that I would like to see changed, and a few opinions that I would like to share. Some may be redundant, But I want to get the point across. Please bear with me.<P>First off, I think the wizard class should be looked at with an eye towards giving it a tighter definition. By looking at the way we operate, in solo or in groups, and Either adjusting, or replacing those elements that simply dilute the class. <P><BR>On the enstill line of spells: <P>I agree that having enstill as a root upgrade is of very limited use to us due to the nature of how wizards fight. Wizards nuke, since the nukes break enstill just as they break root, you never get to see the extended duration of the spell. With that in mind, Enstill only makes sense in a context where you would be dotting and waiting for the mob to die. Or parking, But our job is not extended crowd control. There are other classes that do it better. And for the cases when you aren't grouped, standard root is usually sufficient anyways.   <P>The root spell is used in our case to give us breathing room to be able to cast our spells that have longer casting times. So to be usefull to a wizard, since we don't have a pet to keep the mob off of us, we need to be able to cast the root while the mob is pummelling us without being interupted. At those levels, Enstill's longer casting time makes it next to impossible to get off. So you still need to have root memmed. Limited spell slots quickly lead to enstill being relegated to the back of one's spellbook, never to be used.<P>In our case, I have to say having both the root and enstill line of spells makes no sense, I would suggest simply making an intermediate spell between Root and Immobilise, and continuing the progression at level 49 when you would get paralysing earth. Such a change would make for a smoother spell progression, and help define the wizard class more clearly, Longer roots are of little value simply because our fights never last long anyways. I'm also reasonably sure that having a very low resistance root at higher levels wouldn't unbalance the class while adding to our grouping value. <P>Defining the class, Heavy artillery and troop transport:<P><BR>On the subject of Nukes:<P>In this case, My opinion can only take into consideration levels 42 and under. To be honest, Up till now I've found them to be quite adequate. They have enough punch to make the difference if used correctly, and are often less resisted that those of my teammates. The selection of 3 different types of damage also makes for wonderfull versatility.  <P>At higher levels however, I can well imagine how the uber hit point mobs could pose a serious problem and prevent us from truly playing our role as heavy artillery. I have a difficult time seeing how even if you pace yourself you'll be able to keep up with the people who aren't limited by their mana, or lack of it. So I definitely like the idea of a nuke based on a percentage of a mobs hit points.<P>On this subject, My only other concern is the role (or lack of) that we are able to play in the case of the ultra resistant or downright magic immune mobs. Personally I've been on a raid where I wound up going up to a black reaver and try to do melee damage simply because there was nothing else I could do.<P>ON THE SUBJECT OF TELPORTS:<P>In the previous Posts I've seen some wonderfull suggestions that would Truly play a key role in defining the wizard class if implemented. As has been pointed out before, Other than the plains, there is very little we can do in the way of teleports that can not be done by a druid. Expanding on this ability to displace people, and possibly things would give a more distinct flavor and make the class as a whole much more usefull allowing us to better complement our fellow players and our groups. <P>First is the Group teleport to our bind point. If no other suggestions are implemented, I would like to see this one in game. There are 2 major reasons for this: <P>First off, Complementing our tanks. The major problem with playing a melee class, or having one along is that if you die or evac there is often going to be a long run back to where you are hunting or dungeon crawling. And unless there is a convenient wizard or druid teleport in the area Being able to teleport isn't going to help. This adds to the underpopulation of out of the way dungeons and means that most warrior types will be reluctant to go exploring or hunting very far from cities or bind points, And it adds significant downtime that really isn't necessary in a group situation. Presently, the only way around this is to have a cleric along for a rez or revive. So even with a shaman or druid along to heal the warrior, this basic problem still persists making it next to impossible to get a tank to come if you haven't a cleric in the group already. If the wizard can group tp to his bind point, It becomes possible for him to go fetch the tanks and bring them back should they die or if you need to evac, reducing downtime for everyone. Personally, I've been in situations where I was told not to mem an evac simply because of the time involved in getting the tanks back to the raid. People preferred to absorb the xp loss from dying and getting revived rather than have to wait for the tanks to get back from the evac point. This would solve both problems, and once again, better define our role in raids and groups.<P><BR>And finally, this is a compilation of suggestions for ways to expand on the teleportation specialisation (some are mine, others have been taken from previous posts) I truly think that this would give a clearer meaning to what it is to be a wizard, and make them even more fun to play.<P>Line of sight teleport spells: like a directional fade. Teleports you X number of feet in the direction you're facing. A wizardly alternative to running,It would add flavor to the class and since it is dependant on mana. It should mainly find use when travelling. You'll want to be carefull of cliffs and holes. A group version would also be fun. Bards sing to motivate people <BR>to greater efforts in mobility, druids and shamans call on the spirits of nature to help them run faster. Wizards should Zap themselves around. <P>The Fade line of spells, You can random teleport yourself out of harms way, it would be fun to be able to do the same to the mob you're fighting, a random teleport. This has built in disadvanteges that would make it a fun spell to learn to use. The possibilities for havoc are limitless.<P>Suggested earlier, a spell that will send a mob back to it's spawn point.<P><BR>I'm sure there are plenty of other ways one can have fun and expand on our 2 major specialties, throwing energy around, and teleporting. Assuming you're reading this, Thank you for your patience. <P>Ps : one last detail, concerning the wizard epic quest, I haven't been able to start it yet, But I understand from what I've read that in the initial stages, doing the quest as it was meant to be done (bringing the note from Solomen to Camin will in some cases not be sufficient to get the truespirit faction faction necessary to allow you to continue the quest. And since the changes implemented to prevent one from simply redoing the note delivery to gain faction, there has been no other way to remedy this problem. Unless I'm mistaken, these quests were meant to be self contained, completion of each part of the quest giving you the faction necessary to move on, I think it's possible that this might not be "working as intended". <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I hope Absor is still reading this.<P>A % Damage spell could really be a nice idea. If a spell is draining, lets say, 5% of the mobs current hp you cant kill the mob with this spell. It is not even worth to use it on normal mobs. But it is GREAT on uber mobs, and the wiz will have to nuke first and they will get killed for sure. But if they do 5% of the mobs current HP it will be real help. And it would give wiz a nice status on raids.<P>I just compared the wiz with all other classes. I cant see any other class that is weaker than the wiz, REALLY no other. And i am not talking about solo. I mean in groups or raids. I dont like to solo, or other that solo all the time.<BR>But in groups a wiz is the most useless class of all. <BR>All tank classes (Warrior, Monk, Rogue, Paladin, Shadowknight, Ranger), are better becauce of their damage output and their Hps.<BR>Enc, no comment. A MUST for a good group or raid.<BR>Mag, a good pet, CoH!, and they can summon nice toys.<BR>Necros, well they are best in solo, but for a group they have a good pet, have mob controll with mess, can heal, and dump mana.<BR>Clerics, again, no comment. a MUST for a good group.<BR>Druid, they can nuke as well as wiz can (dont know for sure, but from what i heard), AND can heal, SoW, Wolform, and even buff real well, (regroth!) and can track named Mobs. Ah, and dont forget, better TPs.<BR>Shaman, The mega buffer. And good Damage with spells.<BR>Bard, needless to say anything.<P>If the wiz is the master of DD, he should get the spells to be it. Or the mana regen to do it.<P>To the solo part, i try and do it, but with velius i get some problems with it.<BR>I tried to kill a green Frost giant, and i had to use all my mana, harvest, and i still had to med a bit to kill it. Hell i even saw a Warrior soloing these Giants.<P><BR>Aridian, level 53 Wiz that REALLY hope someone read this and that something is changed.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Raistlin Majere. Ever heard of him? The mage from Dragonlance who started out as a pitifully-ill boy who had to rely on his brother for everything, and then grew into a pitifully-ill Archmage who challenged the gods.<P>He is my image of what a wizard should be. Arcane spellcasters (yes, I have the 3rd Ed. D&D PHB) should be indispensable to a high-level group. In EQ, ALL arcane spellcasters (necromancers, magicians, enchanters, and wizards) should be equally valuable to a group. However, in the end wizards got the short end of the stick because of our over-dependence on mana and the lack of some other method of contributing to a group. Well, here are my suggestions. You can adopt one or more of them.<P>**Mana Batteries**<BR>Make a wizard-only item that can be purchased in a wizard’s guild (probably just Erudin) or accessible in a mid-teens quest. The item can be a piece of equipment or an inventory item that is capable of storing mana that are no drop. Whenever we have downtime, these things recharge mana on their own, and when we right-click them, they empty themselves and restore some of our mana (I don’t know how much, maybe a bub or two? Anything, but make it relative to level)<P>**Percent-based Spells**<BR>Give us spells that reduce a mob’s HP and a wizard’s mana pool by a certain percentage. A good suggestion would be 34 level % spell that reduces a white/black mob’s hp by 10% while reducing the wizard’s mana pool by the same percentage, with a change of 1% of damage and –1% mana per level. For example, a level 34 wizard casts this on a level 34 mob, he slices off 10% of that mob’s health and it costs him 10% of his mana. If he casts it on a level 39 mob, only 5% of the mob’s health is sliced but he uses 15% of his mana because the mob is five levels above him. If he casts it on a level 44 mob, it slices 0% of the mob’s HP and he has just wasted 20% of his mana. However, if he casts it on a 29th level mob, then he takes off 15% of the mob’s hp instead of 10% and it costs only 5% of his mana because of the difference of five negative levels. Minimum mana cost is 1%. This can be potentially overpowering, so maybe a long repop and/or casting time will balance it out.<P>**Fade/Shadow Step/Yonder**<BR>Fix these spells. Give us some form of control, such as teleporting in the direction we are facing, fix the Z-axis bug (can’t teleport up, only down or across level surfaces), and, above all, ADD A MINIMUM DISTANCE FOR THE TELEPORT!!! There was nothing I hated more than shadow stepping a total of TWO FEET while being attacked by a goblin battlemaster in Lake of Ill Omen. The Z-axis correction isn’t such a big deal, but for goodness sakes, a teleport does us no good if it teleports us two feet to our right, opening up a better attack path for the goblin. Neither does it help us if we end up just outside the same ruined fortress that we just escaped (read: the ruins in Lake of Ill Omen).<P>**Dragonform**<BR>I read this on another thread somewhere, and it sounds pretty cool. I mean, dragons in common high fantasy are the masters of magic, especially magical damage. Dragonform would transform wizards into drakes or wyverns. While in dragonform, the wizard gets improved Melee, AC, and HP (turning him into a nuking tank; bonuses depend on which dragonform). He can still cast spells, for the most part, but he cannot meditate or access spellbook to change spells. For balancing, while in dragonform wizards can’t access inventory (and thus right-clickable items), cannot cast self-protection spells (any already on him at dispelled), teleport spells dispel dragon form, and once he has sustained a certain amount of damage (half or a quarter of normal HP, for instance) he reverts back into normal form with all the HP loss and is stunned for a certain amount of time. AC bonuses from armor do not affect him in dragonform, though sustained magical effects and bonuses (like the +10 int from a Stein of Moggok) still apply.<P>Other than giving wizards more options within a group (allowing it to take the role of a tank or nuker), it is also gonna be hella fun to play, and gives us something else to look forward to other than Sunstrike or Lures. I’m sure 60 Wizards would love appearing in newbie areas as sky drakes and wyverns.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>**Bestow Power**<BR>While this could be considered in the realm of an enchanter, how about a spell or skill that permits wizards to enchant a warrior’s weapon with a particular nuke that acts as a limited duration proc. The nuke must be something like one half to three-fourths the wizards level. For example, if a 60 wizard bestows a warrior’s sword with the Lvl. 29 DD Inferno Shock, then for the next, say, 30 seconds or a certain number of hits (whichever comes first), every successful hit the warrior makes with that particular weapon deals the same amount of damage as the spell Inferno Shock. Again, this may be considered unbalancing unless there is some sort of penalty involved, so I suggest that the wizard sacrifice one of his nukes (his own choosing, must be in spell slot) for the duration of the spell, or else give this spell some big reagent.<P>**Damaging Root**<BR>How about a Root/Enstill-type spell that deals constant crushing damage for the duration of the spell? Again, this is also potentially unbalancing, but considering Root is perhaps the one of the most-used spells by low-level wizards, we should have SOME sort of insight as to how it works. So, a Root spell that lasts as long as the Lvl. 4 Root, but with a stronger resilience (i.e. does not break after just ONE hit. Arrgh), and deals low DoT. This is just a random idea, not at all necessary, and perhaps won’t even help in advancing wizard group usefulness.<P>**Al’Kabor**<BR>Two ideas for this. Firstly, make Al’kabor a high-hp spawn that can’t cast or hit for sh*t in a common newbie zone so that we wizards can beat the cr@p out of him until you fix the Al’kabor line of spells. Secondly, FIX THE AL’KABOR LINE OF SPELLS so that they have a lower mana cost and higher damage. Actually, fix ALL area effect spells so that they don’t have such a high aggro, and so that we can cast them and be useful to a group during an overpull.<P>**Quicken Spell**<BR>Give wizards a skill that allows them to halve the casting time on maybe two or three spells per day. Once clicked, the next spell the wizard casts takes half as long to cast. The Quicken Spell button repops every 8 or 12 hours, depending on how many Quicken Spells the wizard can use.<P>**Instant Spell**<BR>Like Quicken Spell, wizards can instantaneously cast one spell per day. Again, this can be an evac, or it can be a last-minute nuke.<P>At least some of these should help wizards get into groups, especially at higher levels, but I personally think that Verant screwed up in splitting the basic "mage" class into four specialty sub-classes, and they ROYALLY screwed up the wizard’s role. If there is ever an EQ2 (a completely new world, the way the upcoming UWO: Origin is to Ultima Online), I hope they keep the classes simple by keeping one universal mage class and then letting him choose a specialization later on, so that we can get pure summoners (essentially magicians, but able to control more than one pet but having very little nuking ability), pet-nukers (ideal combo for magic-users), necros, and enchanters.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
