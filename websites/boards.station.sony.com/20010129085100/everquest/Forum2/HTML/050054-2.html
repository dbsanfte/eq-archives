</FONT><HR>I am just as anti-drug as the next guy. I've had a chance to smoke pot with one of my fav bands after I saw them in a show but declined. I have been offered more free drugs then Jim Morrison, hell a guy offered to take a 45 min drive over to my house with a "sample pack" of LSD, shrooms, pot and some extacy.. but I still stick to my guns and say no. I dont drink smoke or do drugs, and do not support it at all.<P>But, I do think you have too much time on your hands. 1 in 300,000 is good odds for 1 kid to really try crack? What about 1 in 300,000 who try to jump off a house to see how much falling damage they take? or 1 in 300,00 who whip out a knife at school because he was "stealing your camp" (the monkey bars), now dosnt it start to look a tad, silly?<P>If a child is stupid enough to think "hey, I should try crack in real life" the problem is on the parents, not the game.<P>I am SICK of people pointing at media/game outlits as a source of their childs problem. They refuse to take responsibility for their lack of parenting skills.<P>- I have listened to music like Rap, Heavy Metal, Death Metal (violent music), and for the past 6 years I have been listning to punk (cant stand rap/metal anymore)<P>- I've been playing violent games since I have been at a young age (wolfenstine/doom/quake)<P>- I have been playing ORPGs on BBS's for eons with "subjestive themes", and MMORPGs since UO<P>- I've watched horror movies at a young age<P>- I have had a passive interest in occult/magic/etc (ie: I read up on it, but NEVER do anything with it)<P>Yet, I am not violent by nature. I dont smoke, drink or do drugs, still a virgin. On the honor roll at school and currently have the top mark in 3 of my class's, have a healthy social life and a girl friend.<P>How could I pump so much trash into me, and still turn out "OK"? - I have GREAT parents. They set rules and boundries, they supported the "healthy" things I was interested in (programming/computers/reading).<P>If anything, I would blame it on the parents for doing a poor job at raising their child, and not blaming it on the games music and movies.<P>Its time to point the finger at YOURSELF and not the media. The number one problem in america is the individuals inability to take ownus of the problems and accept that it is THIER fault. They would much rather not take any responsbility and point at the outside source.<P>If a kid does "crack" IRL because he asked for "crack" in game, then that kid has many more problems in real life which should be dealt with, if it wasnt the game, it would of been a movie, if it wasnt a movie, it would of been a TV show, if it wasnt TV it would of been the music, if it wasnt the music, it would of been peer pressure that gets the blame. But in the end the finger of blame needs to point at the parents.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree, crack is bad, but even worse is the drop paraphenilia that verant has put into this game.  I encountered a player today carrying a "sorceror's bowl", which has mind altering properties.  Either nerf this item, or at the very least include something comparable for melee classes.<P>Finally, NERF ALCOHOL TOLERANCE!  This skill is simply too powerful, and increases much too quickly.  My alcohol tolerance is now up to 175, and it's getting much too expensive to get a good buzz.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>While I cannot argue with your stance regarding drug usage (too much LSD in the 70's) I might suggest to you that reading the word "crack" typed out online in a FRGP and smoking crack in the basement are two VERY different and FAR removed behaviours.  Were it not for the earnestness I can easily see in your post (again, too much LSD in the 70's) I might have thought you were simply trolling.  But then, that would make this entire thread a crock wouldn't it?<P>aiki</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>If there is a 13 year old child who does not know what a crack dealer is, then their parents have failed them. I mean that sincerely. Children playing this game unattended (which by the EULA they must be at the least 13) should already know about drugs, what they are, how they can destroy your life, and how to avoid them. If they don't, then I hold their parents fully responsible for them unwittingly discovering the dangers of drugs. <P>As far as the term "crack" and its use in vernacular language, it is not limited to EQ, or clarity, or any fantasy rpg. It is used to describe all sorts of accellerated or abnormal behavior or even appearance. <P>I am against the use of drugs and with good reason. However, banning the term "crack" in a video game that shouldn't even be played by young children without supervision is a waste of time and an insult to the intelligence of the adults who play this game. If you see something that is offensive to you in game, report it. If it really is offensive, then action will be taken by the appropriate authorities. If not, then you always have the option of removing this negative influence from your household. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I would prefer that you do not, however, attempt to have the world boiled and pureed into a non offensive and insipid pap due to your own insecurity, as that would take the interest out of the world for the rest of us. <P>I know crack is bad, I don't have to have the word filtered from my hearing to make value judgements about it (or indeed, have others make them for me as you would have).  The jocular use of the word in other contexts is one of those subtle differences that intelligent people are able to discern, and I have little use for those that lack the subtlety and acumen to know otherwise. <P>In short, to a nunnery, go. <P><BR>  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Afterall, the game that they play, with every parent watching them 100% of the time btw (not!) says its ok to be one.<P>So lets go into our 7th or 8th grade and play "Crack Dealer".  How many teachers do you know in which that would settle with them?  If you think it would, then open your eyes to the real world and the problems in general with drugs.<P>I KNOW it happens folks, geez, I'm not blind.

</FONT><HR>I play an Enchanter and for the most part, I do not cast Clarity on those that ask for Crack.  There are a few occasions wher eI have ever looked ut because we were on a huge Plane raid and poopoo could hit the fan any second and I just did not feel like wasting time trying to explain to someone why they should not reduce my role to that of a scummy drug dealer.  I applaud your stand and will bump this message.<P>To all of you who are playing this down like it was some joke, I had a real close friend that died from Crack so I do take this personally.  Joke all you want but when people mention that word, in reference to the drug, it brings back a lot of bad memories.  I know many of you will probably not understand and even a few of you will probably poke fun and flame for whatever childish reasons you have.<P>I do not go as far as reporting the person but when someone thanks me for casting clarity on them and they call it crack, I just ask them to thank me by not calling it crack.  I ask them to spend the extra half a second and type the extra two letters it takes to Spell Clarity.  If they still complain, I ask them to at least call it candy, because it is sweet and delicious and you always want more.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
