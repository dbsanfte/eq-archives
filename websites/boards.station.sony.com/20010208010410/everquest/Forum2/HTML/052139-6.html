</FONT><HR>A few suggestions from another level 60 enc:<P>We already have a high-level/high mana mez spell: Rapture (lvl 59)...which is useless.  The main problem in Velious is that creatures are either mezzable by dazzle (lvl 49) or completely unmezzable.  There is no in-between [the only place in Kunark where you even use glamour is on mushrooms and juggernauts in Sebilis].  And there are absolutely no situations where Rapture is preferable over Glamour(lvl 54)...as the level limits are precisely the same. I have no problem with high mana requirements for keeping a high level mob mezzed...but it should at least be possible.  This is certainly the #1 reason Velious is boring for enchanters, because they have little to do in most situations.<P>How about having dictate (lvl 60 fixed duration charm) resistable (currently, it simply does not work) on 58+ level mobs?<P>The entire whirl line is also useless...for the mana cost you are better off just using aoe stuns.<P>It would be very nice if the lvl 55 pet would dual wield on cast...and have a different look!  <P>How about being able to cast an illusion on a pet?<P>More illusions please  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>The Rune IV effect on the resplendent robe is useless...long casting time and still costs a peridot.  It pales in comparison to other bp effects (like cleric bp) in terms of usefulness.  The most reasonable fix would be to remove the component requirement.<P>Its late...I'm sure I'll think of more later.  Thanks for the chance to provide some feedback!<P>Nadaria<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Mask Faith-<P>I love this idea, I have built my faction and rebuilt it and formed it, building a good repore with almost every faction, which I will say is not easy, but some factions are negative due to my religion even though I attempt to try to fix this.<P>SKs of Qeynos (Bloodsabers) I personally have recieved many a harm touch for even walking into Qeynos now but the palidans love me and clerics arent too happy with me offing their kolandi fish. So I attempt to do my epic, I either do my epic or I keep myself on good terms with tunare and most palidans.<P>Yes, agnostic is the standard for new enchanters, having the guts to choose a religion has become a restriction, having no guts seems a bonus. Apparently if you stand for nothing in the game you can get anyway with anything.<P>I dont like even having an agnostic tag, but its a choice, but if you have that, at least let us alter the apperance of our religion.<P>It is the idea that I am jewish and they can tell because why?? I dont tell them, they just assume so and want to kill me? From a roleplay standpoint it makes no sense.<P>I might follow Karana, but who can see that??? Who knows that?? If I wore an talisman of karana I could understand, but come on, make religious faction a thing of the past.<P>Change religion to affect only certain items, and only the god whom you honor knows it. How the hecht does Captain Lancelot know I follow Karana?? I just boggles me.<P>Faction and Religion should not be intertwined, I think it was done early on as a convience. <P>I was told early on by a guide that mobs can sense my religion, but I never had anyone sense I was jewish and start to sing slurs at me. Its sad that your game would endorse this.<P>--------------------------------------------------<BR>Either give us a choice to mask our faith from people wishing to do us harm, or give us the choice to change religion ( which will never happen ) or deal with an entire class whose deity is always nothing because otherwise they cannot do anything.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok a few things that might have been missed.<P>Number 1.  Augmentation doesn't override Quickness, this is VERY annoying as when I join a group I keep a clarity and aug cycle (same duration time so its easy for me)<P>Number 2.  Higher level mezes should override other mezes.  If a necro casts Screaming Terror, and I cast Dazzle, then my Dazzle should over ride his ST.  Its just common logic.<P>Number 3.  Make the mob that is mezed look different, I don't know make it lie down or something, like it FD'd.  And when a target is mezed make who ever had it targeted no longer have a target.  This is especially annoying as when I get a stupid warrior or bad pet class attacking and accidently targeting the wrong mob, it breaks my mez, mob gets on me, and next thing I see is LOADING... PLEASE WAIT.<P>Number 4.  Resists to mez.  Granted the uber taunt in the Tash line, I just open up with mez.  I know our DD's are calculated by taking the targets MR and adding +25mr to it (hence our huge resists).  Perhaps something could be done about our mezes using a similar formula but in the exact opposite view.  Take our charisma X (those who have 200 will actually like this) and apply it to Y mob with Z MR, what ever X charisma is divide it by Z, to get B chance of resist.  <P>Example my charisma is 200. If I say mez a Greater Kobald in solb who has say (90 magic resist) and is level 35.  When I cast mez, it should take my 200cha multiply by .5 =40.  90-40 =50.  Just a thought, not a mathmatican by anymeans but please make our abnormal cha somewhat usesful.<P>Number 5.  Illusions.  I love my illusions!  I think Wolf should give sow.  I think Fire dmg shield should be 15points of dmg at 52 not 60.  I would like to see more illusions (e.g. Spectre, Brownie, Shadowman/our pet form, ect...)<P>Number 6.  Class armor.  Other than the mages, chanters rank last in quest armor.  Lucky wizards with mask and cape, necros with failyed (sp) skin.  I would seriously like to see some incandescant boots, robe, MANTLE! god we need a good shoulder piece, and ammo slot.  Or just any decent ammo slot in general.  Perhaps we could have a spell that summons something to put in the slot like mages have???<P>Number 7.  Our pets, they seriously suck, but understandable why.  I'm not asking for commands, but please just give us an ability, or command, or spell that gives the effect of /pet back off.  Make it so we don't have to target the pet, just so that it happenes.  Sometimes when I'm soloing and I'm getting beat up and I need to cast a mez, my animation should get the hint to back off.<P>Number 8.  Our Epic weapon flat out sucks.  I have no desire at all to be seen with it just so I can get spammed with requests by melees for "can you rt click your weapon to buff me."  MAKE IT USEFUL TO US FOR GODS SAKE!  Give it an added clarity 3 like buff.  That way we can benefit from it as well.  Every other Epic somehow benefits the other classes, and its not like we can melee.<P>Number 9.  This is sort of related to the illusions crossing zones but not exactly.  I think that if we go LD and we have an illusion up in an area where mobs would normally be KOS to us, our illusion should NOT drop when we come back in.  Maybe make it so when we camp the illusion does not "fade."  Its most annoying when I log in and I see that message.  Again, I can see the concern here, but it is mostly for going LD,  which is an out of game problem and we should not be punished for techinal glitches.<P>Other than that I think the class is great.  I love my chanter<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Under no circumstances should enchanters get any form of sow!  If so, be ready to give druids and shamans a low level clarity, since most of the time we get clarity is in trade for a sow.  You're not an actual wolf like a druid is, you just look like one, there's no reason for increased speed.  Absor, VI is always stressing that class inter-dependence is extremely important, for example melee binding, do not ignore the effects that a change like this could have.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Here are some comments:<BR>- This is difficult to do without unbalancing us for single group situations."&lt;<P>Absor Wrote:<BR>&gt;And this seems to be the key issue will all casters lately, with the same problems. But enchanters have a somewhat unique problem here. Look at the spells that you want to use; charms, mez, stun… spells that completely change the combat. Crowd control that works on an encounter that has, say, two monsters and is designed to be fought by twenty people… you'd be able to cut the encounter in half! You would, effectively, be acting as ten other characters.<P>So I'm sure you can see why it's going to be a challenge to change things like this, and you can see why these powers are limited. Enchanters, though, have several backup things to do, and this helps a lot. Buffs and such keep you busy (yes, but not as 'challenged' as you are when you are doing crowd control), and it adds a lot to the party. Hastes and mana regen are very, very effective tools.<P> Absor why do you think this is the key issue with all casters lately. I can tell you that every class that has this problem be it Enchanter's , Necros, or who ever, has gone from level 1 to level 50 making a direct impact on the mobs their fighting. Now Verant and you it seams want to change the way Enchanter's play, going from an active role to a support role and you want us to be happy at the same time with the change. <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P> You also said:<BR> Crowd control that works on an encounter that has, say, two monsters and is designed to be fought by twenty people… you'd be able to cut the encounter in half! You would, effectively, be acting as ten other characters.<BR> Lets stop this please, I don't know any Enchanters who want to have spells that can do this, nor do they ever think they will get them. All enchanters and others want to do is not be forced into a role they were never meant to be "support only". Sure support is one of our jobs, but to change Enchanters to support only in high level encounters and Vellious is to much to ask.<BR> With the release of SoV Enchanters need not apply for any openings in Velious unless we want to be support only. It never said "Beware unfriendly to Enchanter's" on the SoV box.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><BR> <BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ok 2 quick things that I just noticed while in Lower guk that moreso have to do with NPC enchanters...my puller gets charmed by the ghoul scribe...group manages to kill ghoul scribe...puller remains  charmed long after it is dead and still attacking me...also I can not stun him as I would be able to if he, the puller, had been an actual NPC.  So basically he was charmed after the scribe was dead and was immune to stuns?!  I finally got sick of the stuns not working (no resist messages either) and just decided to mes the puller until he gained control of himself.   hmm  doesnt seem like it would have been the same situation if I had charmed the scribes pet and gotten killed...I'm sure the pet would have reverted back to its original state.<P>Ai w pi <BR>Chanter 45th <BR>Quel</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;"I would like to see Illusions: Wolf changed such that it has the effect of the lowest level sow. "&lt;&lt;<BR>&gt;I am very much against the idea that we do anything further to dilute the classes. I, personally, won't endorse this idea. But I'll add it to the list.&lt;<P>I think that's fair enough. As much as I want new things for my favourite class, I'd much rather see each class retain as much uniqueness as possible.<P>However, I have seen two possible suggestions for making the Enchanter's wolf illusion more useful:<P>(1) Allow it to work indoors. Since we're keeping the classes unique and our other illusions work both in and out of doors, I think this is an excellent suggestion. Especially since, as several people have pointed out, the BetaNeutral faction issue no longer exists.<P>(2) If there is some reason not to do that, or everyone is dead set against it, you could give our wolf illusion a minor speed increase (someone suggested midway between normal speed and SoW speed). Since a SoW would still be better, and we can only cast the wolf illusion on ourselves, it shouldn't dilute the role of the Druid.<P>As much as I might personally want a speed buff, however, I honestly think option 1 is a more logical solution for the class, and makes more sense.<P><BR>&gt;&gt;Illusion: Monster (Zone specific Illusion of a random mob - Faction probably an issue here… how about making us insta-kos? That should be easier to code than individual faction for each possible illusion)&lt;&lt;<BR>&gt;Monster (and any copycat illusion), however is pretty much a no, because of faction. I've gone over this many times with the coders, and it's not going to happen any time soon. I'll have it on the list, as a reminder, but don't expect it.&lt;<P>If faction is the restricting factor, then why not consider either having the Illusion: Monster line of illusions have no effect on faction at all or, if they provide some other benefit, even have them make us KoS?<P>I mean, basically when a Mage uses a Monster Summoning spell, they're getting a normal pet that just looks like, say, a Sand Giant, right? They don't actually get a pet that is a Sand Giant. So... why can't the Illusion: Monster spells work the same way, except instead of summoning a pet (Mage speciality) it makes and illusion (Enc speciality)?<P><BR>&gt;Illusion armor. Instead, how about just adding an illusion component to the existing armor spells?&lt;<P>I like this idea a lot.<P><BR>&gt;&gt;"Even though my main character is an Enchanter and the spells are fun, I really don't think we should've gotten the undead illusions (Skeleton, Drybones). I think these should've remained uniquely Necromancer spells. Of course, I'm in the minority here and so it's unlikely that it will change, but that's just my opinion."&lt;&lt;<BR>&gt;Well, your opinion matches mine, so it can't be all bad.&lt;<P>Thanks, but what about the Group Illusion: Race line I suggested? Can those please go the list as a possibility for high level illusion spells? Thanks.<P><BR>&gt;&gt;"Is there anything that can be done to fix the bug in the size you appear when using illusions? I kinda hard from an RP perspective when you're twice the size of the gnomes you're pretending to be."&lt;&lt;<BR>&gt;So you don't see this as a cool side affect? Being a huge gnome or a tiny lizard is pretty cool to me. I'll add it to the list, as it probably really is a bug. But I think it's kinda cool, myself.&lt;<P>Definitely a bug. It might possibly be a cool effect if it was just the way the spell always worked, but as it is, it only looks that way to people who enter the zone after the spell was cast.<P><BR>&gt;&gt;"On the illusions dropping at zone thing. Please leave that as is. As a bard with my illusion masks, there are times I need to zone to drop em. I can't really walk around FV as an iksar..."&lt;&lt;<BR>&gt;Educate me on this. Can't you just click the illusion off?&lt;<P>Yes. An Enc can click to cancel any illusion that we cast (as far as I know).<P>I think the risk of accidentally gating while under the effects of a KoS illusion are far less that those of zoning in or going LD and being attacked before you could possibly cast the illusion spell.<P><BR>&gt;&gt;"Religion faction adjustment can never be hidden, not even by illusion. Seems like it should be possible... then maybe enchanters wouldn't have to be 99% agnostic."&lt;&lt;<BR>&gt;Normally I would pass this one. But you got me thinking. You see, I'm perfectly fine with enchanter suffering like everyone else with their religious choices. But, well, they aren't anymore because by now every single new enchanter is being told by their mentors to restart their characters as agnostic. That's something that I don't like at all. Hmm…<BR>I'll add the idea of a mask faith spell to the list and see how the discussion goes internally. It should be fun.&lt;<P>When I first started my Enc, I picked a deity to sort of give flavour to the character. I also assumed that there would be specific advantages and disadvantages to each one (to me it's the combination that's makes a character interesting and fun). Unfortunately, by the time I got the character into the lower "teens", I realised that for an Enc (as the game exists right now anyway), it just doesn't work that way. You're basically either Agnostic or a portion of your Illusion spells are worthless, and there is little (if any) benefit.<P>At the advice of many people, I restarted as Agnostic, and in spite of the hassle, I have found the character to be much more playable. I would prefer that it didn't have to be this way.<P>I have no problem with there being strong disadvantages to each deity, as long as there are also strong advantages, and/or ways to work around the problems. If every Enc is always Agnostic, then the game loses something, just like if everyone decided that one specific race made the "best" Encs and so every Enc was that race. It takes a lot of the fun out of it.<P>Religion, like Languages, is one of the things in EQ that I think has a lot of potential, but is seriously underutilised in the game at the moment. (see my "Some small suggestions" thread for several ideas about languages, if you're interested)<P><BR>Thanks again!<P><BR>Cheers,<P>C.

</FONT><HR>My main issues are mainly PvP.<BR>Enchanters seriously suck major a-- in PvP.<P>Direct Damage: Our DD spells are a joke. They are very resistible, all or no dmg, and magic based.I suggest making them less resistible and not all or none dmg. <BR>Reduce the casting time on Dementia.<P>Tashan-line doesn't help us much either. It would be more effective if it lowered it by percentage. ie: Tashania lowering 33% of the players MR instead of 33 points.<P>Mesmerise-line: Too many players cast a low level long lasting DoT to keep themselves from being mezzed. It is an exploit that needs fixed in someway.<P><BR>Non-PvP Issues<P>Mesmerise-line: This line of spells was made totally useless in 90% of velious. You ripped away 95% of our class by doing that.<P>Illusions: More illusions over level 44. We get the title Illusionist at 51... why?<P>Equipment: Us enchanters want items with High AC, HP, and CHA items. We care less about INT.<P>Lull-line: Reduce the resists on this and have it notify us when it is resisted. If not, just remove the damn thing.<P>Tashan-line: Reduce aggro. See above.<P>Sentinel: remove this, its useless<P>Pet: Why not give us a controlable pet after level 49? Yes you say we are not a pet class but neither is Shaman but they can control their pet.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR> Absor,<BR>  In your reply to all the post you started off by saying this: <BR>  Keep in mind that there is nobody that knows anything about EverQuest that doesn't worry that enchanters are already overpowered, even those that play enchanters. This applies to a few other classes as well. So keep in mind that by taking a careful look at this class, I may very well be prompted to suggest a reduction in the power of something. This is just as important as the increase in power of things to maintain a balance. I'm not telling you that this is my intent, just letting you know that it could happen. <BR>  Just come out with the truth, be up front with us and tell us what you think is overpowered about us. Tell us the areas that you think are overpowered and let us know what areas you are going to request a reduction for in order to have balance in the game.<BR>  We already know that Verant thinks we are over powered. Verant made Velious Enchanter unfriendly just to counter what they lets us do in Kunark. So with your statment I think it shows us whats coming.<BR>  Enchanter's can make groups level faster, kill bigger mobs and help take control of a fight, be it big or small. Verant and you seam to want to stop that. Is it the Enchanter that is over powered, or do we make groups TOOO powerful. I for one think its the later that Verant and you don't like.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>FROM ABSORS COMMENTS:<P><BR>PixyBrat wrote:<P>&gt;"Ideas worth exploring <BR>- We need more to do at high levels against highly magic resistant mobs. Here are some comments:<BR>- This is difficult to do without unbalancing us for single group situations."&lt;<P>And this seems to be the key issue will all casters lately, with the same problems. But enchanters have a somewhat unique problem here. Look at the spells that you want to use; charms, mez, stun… spells that completely change the combat. Crowd control that works on an encounter that has, say, two monsters and is designed to be fought by twenty people… you'd be able to cut the encounter in half! You would, effectively, be acting as ten other characters.<P>So I'm sure you can see why it's going to be a challenge to change things like this, and you can see why these powers are limited. Enchanters, though, have several backup things to do, and this helps a lot. Buffs and such keep you busy (yes, but not as 'challenged' as you are when you are doing crowd control), and it adds a lot to the party. Hastes and mana regen are very, very effective tools.<P>If I read this right, Absor, you want us to become buffers in Velious (probably applies to other classes) What I'm reading in the posts is that we don't want to be just dispensers of Haste and Mana regen. Mostly because we'd sit in the back of the group, stand up every 20 min and cast those spells then sit down while the fight goes on. (remind me to memorize gate when I get to that point. If im not fighting I have plenty of time to gate out and the monsters can't resist that)<P><BR>If this is the case, what is the role of an enchanter according to Verant? And why did we even get the mez line in the first place if it's not suppose to be used at later levels?<P>I don't know about the rest of you enchanters out there but the only time I will visit Velious is if there is an item I want. I will stay that long and then keep fighting in Kunark and the old world. The Tanks and Clerics, can find someone else (write in bard, shamana, necro in here) to give them haste and clarity. I will fight in a place where my full potential is used.<P>On a different topic, here is a illusion I'd like to see. Illusion Corpse, makes me look like a nearby corpse. I wouldn't be able to move, but mobs would leave me alone. (I used minor illusion for this at lower levels) Don't make it as nice as feign death. Give it a long casting time or make it so if something is agro'ed on you it won't trick them. Also there would be a chance the mob would notice something. (Save vs int?)<P>I appologize for the spelling errors, it's late and my mind isn't what it should be.<P>Spyer O'Brian</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor<P>I see a small problem possibly occuring with the suggestion of making illusions not remove when zone. <P>Consider a monk has Mask of Deceiver (old version)and is doning the illusion of dark elf accidently runs into Firiona Vie where they would be KoS in dark elf form.  They Feign Death and /q out so that they can remove the illusion since they can't by clicking to remove the illusion.  <P>If the game mechanics are changed so that illusion does not drop when zoning I wouls assume it would be the same for logging off and would cuase the monk in this instance to have to stay Feign Death while waiting for the illusion to ware off.<P>This obviously is minor and is not something that will occure on a regular basis, but just a thought to consider as I am sure there are other instances where similar things could occure.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hmmm.. i have to say something here at least...<P>Illusions:  I don't think we should have group illusions.  Also, the title of our class at 51 is: "Illusionist".... not "Non-Undead, Non-Animal Illusionist".  The arguement that other classes "transform" is semantics.  The illusions we have that do give abilities/stat bonuses are as much a transformation as other classes are, reguardless if you want to lable them an "Illusion".  If the illusion exsits, the "Masters of Illusions" should have them.<P>I do belive that giving the Mages pet summmoning was a mistake.  Mages are Elementalists.  There are 4 elements in magic... earth, air, fire, and water..which, oddly enough, is what the mages pets were until summoning.  a better arguement would be for that to be given to chanters who's pet is an "Illusion" of something in the area.  I still haven't figured out why, if we use magics based on the mind, we can "animate" something... doesn't make sense for the class.<P>Our Pet:  it says it's a pet; when VI nerfs pets, ours gets nerfed.   The only time its not a pet is when pets are adjusted to make them better.  I will say, i think they're ok as is.  They're more of a dot, and treated as such, can be pretty usefull.<P>Clarity:  We should never be told by someone our level that they don't want clarity because their "self mana regen" is better.  Necros mana is bugged, you've said, giving them back more mana than it should. But you won't fix it.  Another notch for necros being such good solo'ers (till they complain they are the weakest class... typically after 50).  Something not entirely chanter specific: an increase to the effectivness of med after say, level 50.<P>A few ideas in a rambling.  Everyone else has pretty well said what needs said, so it's down to opinions.<P>Moraganth<BR>good brewer, better drunk.<BR>  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Please take a look at the level 55 blur Memory Flux. The spell costs 350 mana and is no more effective at removing an Enchanter from a mobs agro list than the 40 mana, level 12 Memory Blur spell. I can't tell you how many times I have Tashed a MoB and agroed it on me then watched in horror as it walked right thru 2 350 mana Mem Blurs and made me into a greasespot. Many of our spells create extreme agro on us from MoBs that can kill an Enchanter in under 10 seconds or less. A reliable(wipes us from hate list), quick casting, high mana cost(350 to even 500 mana) memory blur at level 55 would sure help. For that kind of mana cost the target should forget we're even in the same zone hehe.<P>Mezmur<BR>All Around Good Gnome<BR>Enlightened Dark<BR>Tarew Marr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, generally I think the enchanter class is pretty good, but there are a few small things.<P>1. Unmezzable mobs.  Currently if you cast on a mob that cannot be mezzed you get a msg saying this creature cannot be mesmerized (with this spell), often followed by the creature beating on you.  I think it's kinda dumb that one rock golem (or shroom or whatever) will mez fine, and the next won't.  I don't mind too much on stuff like shrooms where you just need a higher level mez once in a while, but on mobs that are 100% unmezzable, like some rock golems, etc, I'd like to see the message before I cast the spell.<P>2. Velious items.  Most of these items are bad for enchanters.  All the resplendent armor (from PoG) is WORSE statwise then stuff from PoH, and PoH I got 10 levels ago, this is no real upgrade.  Ok, some of it has effects, which is fine, but the effects suck!  Look at the leggings for instance, effect: clarity.  Ok, this is a level 29 spell which went to the back of my spellbook the day I got level 54, and the cast time on the legs is 15!!  If I am rezzed, I can have clarity 2 on me SOONER if I just sit and med and cast C2, than if I use the legs on me for C1 and then med till I can cast C2.  That's the only use I can really see for the legs, and with the cast time it's less efficient than not using the legs.  Also, the robe effect is never gonna be used, long cast time, still uses a peridot, and for a worse version of a spell than I could cast.  I would always use rune V as it still only takes one peridot, and is a lot better than rune 4.  The bracers have reclaim energy, still useless since we almost never use pets by this level, but not all the effects need to be useful, a couple useful effects might be nice tho.  Drops off Velketor have the same prob.  The crown off him has nice stats, but the effect is cast time of 15, for a stun!  That's ok because it has good stats, but there's also the crystal rod of confusion off him, which has horrid stats (+6 int/cha - no other stats) for coming off an insanely hard mob, and has the same prob, long cast time for a 6 second stun.  The original spell had a cast tims of 1.5, and recast of like 8 seconds, and you put a cast time of over 10 on this, making it worthless, no one this level would wear this or use the effect.  Guess we just need to bring those level 1 twinks along to loot this no drop junk.  Please look into at least the cast time if not the effect on these items.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

This applies to a few other classes as well. So keep in mind that by taking a careful look at this class, I may very well be prompted to suggest a reduction in the power of something. This is just as important as the increase in power of things to maintain a balance. I'm not telling you that this is my intent, just letting you know that it could happen. &gt;&gt;<P>Before you think of making us less powerful in a group scenario please realize that if we are not wanted in groups, we are basically out of luck.  Enchanters are not like Wizards, Magicians, Necromancers...we cannot effectively (key word being effectively) solo.  Without a group, we can't do much or go very far.  Therefore, if the enchanter class is "nerfed" to the point that we are not as needed in groups...what are we going to do?  <P>With the introduction of SoV, we have already been reduced to a very different role than the one we are used to, the one that utilizes the Enchanter's strengths. Crowd Control.  By weakening what we do best, you weaken the entire class and you weaken our playing time, making it less and less desireable to click the "enter game" key every day.  If the Enchanter class ends up being not a wanted part of daily groups, useless on big raids, and is unable to solo effectively, what is left for this class?<P>I ask that you think that through before making any "nerfs" and think how it will effect the Enchanter's game play as a whole.<P>Thank you. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> Wow page 6, well i'm not sure if these issues have already been addressed or will be seen but here goes:<P><BR>   1)  We need Velious illusion.  For every other city, if we have been carefull with our faction, illusion race spell and faction spell could get us to indifferent at worst.  We need illusions for Velious.  Two that leap to mind are Illusion Dire Wolf, changes faction with Velious giants. And Illusion Drake or Wyvern, to change faction with dragons.<P>   2) The magic resistance of velious mobs, even tashed is way too high. Remember every single enchanter spell is save vs magic, so the new continent has basically neutered us.<P>   3) At level 50 or so, enchanters should get a spell Mez Giant Class Creature.  Make it 500 mana, and only last 25 seconds, we would not mind.  Enchanters are considered masters of crowd control, but in Velious where 2/3s of the mobs are unmezzable, and uncharmable due to high magic resists (see 2) ,we are just clarity dispensers.<BR> <BR>  Enchanters for the most part are well balanced, we die alot, but thats the price we pay for our great abilities.  But with the release of Velious, everything we have been good at has been taken away from us.  We have no illusions that let us pass thru the new cities.  We cant cast any spell at a mob without it just bouncing off.  And with the new continent, we cant even control crowds anymore.<P>   Please give us back the things we were best at.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>constructive criticism on enc problems and possible solutions:<P>Illusions dropping while logging in after LD MUST NOT HAPPEN. Almost every enchanter I talked to has died at some point in the past because of this, and it's an issue related to connectivity rather than any in-game issue. If I'm runnin through neriak while being connected to my ISP for 10 hours straight I get to log back into an exciting sprint for the zoneline  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>I really love the 55 pet, but I feel it got shafted in a way. Either making it automatically dual wield like you did to everyone else's (higher level) pet (including SKs), or cost only 1 tiny dagger per cast instead of 3, or something else would be a great help. I find myself ninja looting FS daggers from my poor group on a need before greed basis  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>What can be the harm with gender illusion? I'm not aware of any factions being gender based. I think it can make for quite a comedic scene or two, though. This would stack with illusion: race, too.<P>I don't really like the idea of illusion: plate, or illusion: warrior or whatever. I've spent some time collecting gear to get the desired class look with the proper illusion. from far away, a Tolapumj robe in wood elf illusion looks a whole lot like an ES tunic  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> I would rather we get more normal illusion: TypeOfMob instead.<P>I always thought a pet illusion would be cool. I can't think of any ideas for it though, really. with monster summoning being a mage spell that really eliminates what was, IMO, a great enc spell. I'm kinda bitter about monster summoning in that it removed the fun factor in charm. it's still a GREAT tactical spell, but when I used to ooh and ahh newbies before by charming that hill giant, a pair of mages run up with a cyclops and griffon pet and they get all the attention. if it was this way throughout EQ's history I suppose I'd be ok with it, but it seems like something was taken away from enchanters by its introduction.<P>BARD SONGS. I honestly find myself avoiding getting bards in group simply because it's very very very annoying to work with them buffwise. verses of victory, a commonly used bard song, doesn't allow Aug to stack over it, so you have to wait in between fights to aug (sometimes you don't have time between fights..) Cantana of replenishment, at 55, bards constantly play because it's a good song. clarity 2 won't stack over it though. gotta tell the bard to stop it, wait for it to wear off, then clarity 2 the whole group (this won't be as big a problem when I get group clarity 2, but for a big stretch is very annoying). If I could see a game reason why this should work this way I could understand, but this looks more like a bug to me than anything. Bard songs should be put on lowest priority as far as stacking over them goes.<P>On a side note, I guess it's too late to ask that bard songs DON'T show up as flashing buff icons?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"> not sure of another way to implement them (maybe every song like the 32 mana song?), nor do I think any re-implementation is easy or worth the time it would take (assuming it wouldn't take 15 minutes to rewrite, heh) But I think if it was done over again, bard songs shouldn't show up as flashing buffs. Again, don't really see a game-based reason for this.<P>Only other problem/bug I know of is charm break message bug. it simply doesn't work. I know breaking charm with invis causes the message to be delayed a lot. This should be looked into methinks.<P>Charm also is bugged in duels. not sure if this is the place to go over it, though. doesn't work right with dispell for some reason.<P>Otherwise, aside from these (mostly) minor issues, I think my enchanter class is a great class, and I'm proud to play a high level enchanter (especially being a minority gnome.)<P>on a totally unrelated, seperate, and out-of-thread note, would a '/duel stop' or '/stopduel' command be so bad? having to log out or zone to stop dueling would cause more lag than issuing a command to set things back to the way before the duel started, I'd imagine. not sure if this is really feasible from a programming point of view, but it would save people a lot of trouble. maybe have it work like /duel, in that it says "Noggel has offered to end the duel with you! Type /accept to end the duel." or something similar.<P>That's all I can think of offhand... if anything else is brought to my attention I'll post it, as well.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>There is a lot here but im going to throw my input on it:<P>Suggestion 1: (This has already been hit but I feel the need to re-emphasize it) Fix the ability to mes in Velious.  I understand you dont want us taking some mobs out of combat but its insane the amount of mobs we cant touch.  I dont really care to play the role of let me sit back and cast speed every 15 mins on a few tanks and dish out c2 every 30 mins.  I actually enjoy chardok with the 8-10 mob pulls where i get to show off my skills at messing a whole bunch of mobs.  Granted it gets old but the first time I encountered it there was a challenge that awaited me for the first time in quite a while.  Currently our mes barely works on anything in Velious...fix it.<P>Suggestion 2: In plane of growth, comparing the effects of X class of armor to enchanter, we get screwed in my opinion.  Our robe casts an outdated rune (Rune IV -- lvl 44 spell) that costs a peridot to cast and our legs cast the outdated clarity (Clarity -- lvl 29 spell).  It would be nice if we could have Rune V on the robe and Clarity II on the pants.  I dont think thats too much to ask when Clerics get a bplate that has a level 59 heal on it, necros get a robe that has the lvl 56 conjure corpse spell, Shamans even get a lvl 54ish RoK Spell on their bplate (Riotous health), Bards get Selo's song of travel on theirs (lvl 50+ RoK song) etc.  So im requesting that our effects be changed for these items as they are completely worthless -- to give you an idea on how worthless the legs are I've hand a wand that granted clarity without it being equipped for a year before I received my pants from PoG.  So why would you put an effect of clarity on pants that are in a velious dungeon when all the enchanters in this game probably have wands that do the same thing from Innoruuk in plane of hate.<P>Suggestion 3: The beserker's line -- you stated it might be overpowering to be able to grant both shaman str and this strength, with the limited time this buff has and its negative drawbacks and the fact that it fades once its absoarbed the dmg its not really an issue.  The only times I've casted it is to absoarb dmg, either on me or someone who is about to die to help out.  The problem is once i've casted it the shaman has to rebuff him, this shouldnt happen when our buff lasts for seconds (if a mob is hitting you) to at the most a few minutes.<P>Suggestion 4: Spell wonderous rapidity -- why does this spell have such a long casting time compared to aanya's quickening.  Not that it matters when you hit 60 and get Visions of Grandeur or you have your epic but I wanted to point this out to those who dont have the spell.  The casting time on the level 53 speed buff is I believe 3 or 4 seconds, at level 57 its 6 or 7 seconds i cant remember.<P>Suggestion 5: RoK spell Mind Wipe (Lvl 54-56? cant remember what lvl) -- the spell cost on this is insane and from what I can tell it is not worth it to use.  From my experiences this spell doesnt have a much higher chance of not being resisted than a lower level spell does.  My input is to make it save as a lure for the insane amount of mana it takes to cast.<P>Suggestion 6: Gift of Brilliance -- to whomever said not to change it im about to point out why this spell is worthless.  Velious seems to be all about massive guild raids.  This spell costs 450 mana and adds a meager 150 mana to max (thats nothing to any class, name one class where 150 mana is going to mean life or death in _any_ situation).  So for all those people who do think it helps and who do cast it dont you find 450 mana to be a bit insane.  Especially when 30-40 casters are asking for it.  Your talking about 10,000+ mana to cast it on all the casters that might be at a raid.  Do NOT change it to increase the max int, I'd suggest increasing the base mana it adds to around 300 or 400 and increasing mana regen by an additional +1 over what it currently does.  The addition 400 mana could save a tank's life if a cleric had it by casting complete heal.  Besides in an epic battle this spell would make a difference.  The mana cost can stay the same if its changed if not then the mana cost should be dropped to 250 in my opinion or at most 300 (base mana it adds * 2).<P>Suggestion 7: Illusions -- only time I did use them was for pvp, but since the change was made where if I cast an offensive spell it breaks my illusion they are pretty much worthless.  Being on a pvp server your pretty much kos everywhere except for the team your on so they dont mean much in the sense of faction.  It would be nice to make them stick when you zone and also not disappear when you cast a offensive spell on a player.<P>Suggestion 8: Rune series + Mes series stacking -- What I mean by this is I want a dazzle that a lvl 54 casts to be overriden by a lvl 60 and a lvl 60 overriden by a lvl 54.  Why you ask?  Lets say your in chardok with a few other enchanters and they arent all the same level, if someone messes a mob and I try to mes that same mob to ensure that it stays messed while we fight the other 12 sarnaks I cant do it.  Currently anyone who is not the same level as the caster who originally messed it cannot mes a mob that has already been messed.  Meaning if two 60s try to mes a mob both stick and either one can mes it at any point in time.  If a level 59 messes then a lvl 60 tries to refresh the mes 50 seconds later it "does not take hold".<P>Same goes for the rune series but im proposing a slight different change for this.  If the current HP absoarbtion of the rune is less than the one being casted on you the new one should take hold.  If not then it shouldnt.  Meaning if you have Rune V on you that has 400 hps left of absoarbtion and a different caster than the original wants to refresh that with Rune V (~700 hp absoarbtion?) then it should take hold.<P>DoTs: Worthless imo, not sure what to propose here, making them shorter duration or something...Torment of Algri or whatever its called was a pretty good one, except that in pvp it doesnt seem to drain a bunch of mana but in pve it tends to help a lot (Crypt guardians it dries them out by the end of the dot from what i've seen)<P>I think thats about it for the suggestions for now im sure there are some other key points that im forgetting about considering the abrupt changes from RoK -&gt; velious made a lot of enchanters mad because our entire role was changed.  Just give us a few more things to do and hopefully make teh changes I have suggested above.<P>Glad to see a thread up maybe VI will get some changes done within the classes now that they are opening up to player comments.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Okay little things, can the lvl 55 pet only use one tiny dagger and not 3 (chanter pets got 3,2,1,3,2,1 etc) and it would be nice if the mana cost on Memory flux was a bit lower, it seem to be the same thing as Blanket of forgetfulness but is not ae, why should it cost more mana.<P>Our dots do not stack with high lvl necro dots, or the shaman epic weapon, making them useless as we only use them on raids.<P>Boon of the Clear Mind (52 enchanter group clarity) is not as effective as clarity(lvl29), and is quickly outdone by clarity2(lvl54), would it be possible to make it equal (not better) then clarity and lower its lvl to say 49? Group augmentation at that lvl would be nice too.<P>Several spell, Whirl till you hurl, dyn's draught, Reocurring Amnesia(sp?), and wake of tranquility just dont work.<P>I personally would like to see the Whirls replaced by single target stuns, like the cleric spell stun and our lvl 55 stun.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have read alot of the posts and there are a lot that have great information :<P>Mezzmo	-  Sentinel: Remove it  <P>Why remove it?  Why not make it like what we thought it was going to be when we got it.  <BR>When cast it should not “go off” until a critter enters the protected area.<BR>Then have it spam only 4 times with a pause of 10 between each spamming.<P>PixyBrat	- A pet similar to the cleric hammer pet. This would be a non-magic based dot. Make it expensive so it's clear this is for situations where we can't otherwise use our mana effectively. Make its damage in line with pet classes at that level, because it's expensive, temporary, and we're not doing anything else. Don't make it look like our sword pet, that's confusing. Suggestion: make it look like the caster, that would be cool! Or, make it look like the mob, but with smaller size / different texture, so there isn't confusion.<P>I agree with most of this except the idea of the pet looking like the caster or the mob.  The Pet is already modeled after an invisible human.  The same way (I believe) that the An Armored Shadow, or A Suit of Sentient Armor is modeled.  Why not allow the enchanters keep the pets the way they are (except I like the auto-duel weld at 55) except… Change the armor flags (not all) of the enchanters pet be allowed to use armor (and show it) with all the plusses and bonuses that is given by that piece of armor.  This way every enchanters pet would be different and yet the same. Plus we would not have a pet that would not be overly powerful.<BR>The pieces that I am thinking of would be the wrists, arms, head, shield and possibly the legs.<BR>&lt;The Magicians pet could use the wrists and arms&gt;<BR>&lt;The Necromancers could use the wrists and shields&gt;<BR>This would also dress up the enchanter’s pets and not take the individuality away from the other classes pets like the necromancer’s specter or the magicians summoned monster type pet spells.<P><BR>ErikTorvald - Well I figured that with the right combination I could slow any mob down, in effect snaring it. So this was my lineup: Weakness, Incapacitate, Suffocate. Str is reduced by 59, 49, 15 totaling ¡V123. Hey that¡¦s not too bad! Well guess what? That little ugly I just cast all that stuff on ran around rather quickly (ie no effect) and to make matters worse he was angry and beat me about for the same amount of damage!<P>What is the good of casting a strength debuff on a NPC ?  I also have never seen a difference in the damage that the critter did before verse’s after .  Why is that?<P><BR>Axterix	- You had so many great points that I have to mention it.  Everyone has to read this.<P><BR>Twyl	- A Great post on illusions. Again every one should read this one. Although I disagree an a couple points. 1. I have no need nor desire to change my sex, and 2. illusion monster – zone specific.  Great I dea but why be insta-KOS?  Beta-neutral on monster illusions + your religion faction would give you a wide variety on how the critters would react you and hey they already have the religon faction programmed into our illusions.<BR>There have been posts made that say that we would be able to travel anywhere with ease if we could change into a monster.  Not so. Again that pesky religion faction. I have traveled in zones that are very dangerous (died a lot of times) while in illusion’d, with a belevelence cast and invisible.  Because of the religion faction I was found out.  First there was the critter that can see through invisible that broke the spell then it noticed my religion.  Opps I am dead   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P><BR>Dunar	- Wow off this first page of post there have now been 3 really good posts on the enchanter class. Although I again do not care for a gender illusion. I believe that with requests like them we will not get the changes that we really need (hey if I give him a token change we can buy a few more months with out having to do anything)    <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P> <P>Leastros Bannweber  - How about letting us have one command for our pets?  Attack.  What good is having a pet that will not attack until you piss off a critter enough that it will ignore every thing tanting it and attack you (the enchanter) ?<BR>I know that there were some people that found a exploit when invising their pets but I really injoy’d walking around with a invisible pet so no one knew what class I am, to have it reappear when I got attacked. Now when I walk around I have to be invisible or have a pet and be pestered regularly for mind buffs  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">    Please see if the exploit cand be fixed so I again can walk around with a pet and be safe with out having to go invisible all the time.<P>I have made numerous posts before, durring the past year and a half, and the new smithing and jewelry skill items were introduced and although some of the ideas were used there were a lot more that were not. One such idea was why limit the number of gems that can be used in a single jewelry piece.  Personnally I find the new velious jewelry more a joke then anything. Adding a +1 to the stats on the plat item. Yup that makes me want to spend another 1-2k training in the skill. <BR>Again I sugest that we be able to use more then one gem per item. <P>Example : Star Rose Quartz + Fire Opal + enchanted  Platinum = ring +4int, +55hp, 5AC.<P>But no…what we got was…..<P>Jacinth, AC/Sv-Magic	+10/-7, ring	+7/-3, ring	+3/+7, ring	+0/+13, ring	0/+14, ring<BR>Black sapphire, AC/Mana/HP 	+3/+30/+30, necklace	+2/+25/+35, earring	+0/+35/+25, earring	+0/+55/+55, necklace	+0/+65/+65<P>Notice how the AC is totally removed?<P>The black sapphire would have been a ok item,  I doubt that I will wear one now   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>Another suggestion type that I put in was magical weapons and armor.  The imbued armor is close to what I was thinking but angain why not putting in enchanted metal and gems into the mix where the armor provides magical effects and stats?<P>Example : Star Rose Quartz + Fire Opal + enchanted  Platinum + curved blade mold, hilt mold, pommel mold, enchanted high quality sheet of metal *, flask water = <BR>Enchanted Scimitar 1HS: damage 5, delay 24, wt 7.5 +4int, +55hp, 5AC<P><BR>Example : Star Rose Quartz + Fire Opal + enchanted  Platinum + enchanted  Gold + Field Plate<BR> Breastplates mold, smithy hammer, sea temper, leather padding, chain jointing, 3 high quality folded <BR>sheets of metal (the plat and gold give the colors…no dye needed) = <BR>Tunic AC 25, wt 10.5, +4int, +55hp <P>But there still is something missing.  The magical or even the imbued armor that enchanters can wear (yes I know the elves can make some).  I mean common  ENCHANTERS is our name and I know for one that as an enchanter I would be very concerned about my AC and the stats that I would want to have. I looked at both elves imbued chain and guess what.  I cannot wear any.  Kanara imbued requires plains pebbles. You cannot say that is a penalty for worshiping a deity because again an enchanter that is a blacksmith would look for and research how to make armor for him/her self that could be worn. A intelligence of 180+ should be able to think this through. From level 35 I have had a robe (advisors) that I think stat wise is a heck of a lot better then the tunic that the elves (both races) can make. And at 40th level I got a robe that is even better. But to tell you the truth I would love to sport some armor of my race/deity that rivels the robes that fall for enchanters of the 49th + levels.  I also was lead to believe that each deities imbued armor would have its own plusses that the others did not.  I have not seen that .   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P><BR>Thank you all for bearing with me and the length of this post.  I hope that the suggestions here (besides mine) are reviewed and and considered.<P>Leàstros Bannwabber<P>	<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor - Please be very careful with adding the changes that they don't step on other classes toes.  I really hate when Verant adds a new item/spell and it is the same, if not better, as another class (new lute from V Lab that casts Werewolf illusion, shoulders from Siren's Grotto that cast Water Elemental Illusion).<P>- Add speed to wolf illusion - If anything, it would have to be a miny SoW.  But honestly, do enchanters have that hard of a time getting a SoW?  I can shout that I am trading Clarity 2 for a SoW and get at least 5 offers in a few minutes.<P>- Group Illusions - These wouldn't necessarily be unbalancing for enchanters, but for other classes.  It would give some classes the opportunity to do quests in every city with no risk;  It would make the masks that rogues/bards get useless since they could just ask an enchanter to make them look human; and it would make the Shaman Skrink spell/potion useless.  Trolls could just ask to be made into Gnomes.<P>.<BR>.<BR>.<P>On a side note, I don't think enchanters are stepping on the toes of druids or necros with their undead and animal illusions.  None of the enchanter illusions do the exact same thing as the other class (spirit wolf adds sow, illusion:wolf adds atk and cold resist; skeleton form for necros increases mana while lowering health, for enchanters it makes them either not eat food or adds a fire resist.)  It's stepping on the toes of another class a lot more when they get the EXACT spell put on an item (see Rogue masks, Bard masks, lute and shoulderpads.)<P>(PS Sorry if this makes no sense whatsoever...

</FONT><HR>I'll go into more detailed items tomorrow, however, here is my extremely short list:<P>1) I think we have the most spells of any spell caster, yet we are still limited to the 8 spell slots.  Ok, so we can do alot, however, we're forced to have some of the basics up at all times, which leaves little room for the extras.  A simple fix.. Change the color line.  The 3rd in the list is fairly useless unless you decide to keep all 3 of the line up.  I can't get the 2nd in the line off without casting the first, and I can't get the 3rd in the line off without casting the 2nd first.  Change the cast time of all 3 to the cast time of the first, and you make the 3rd spell in the line an actual upgrade, and you free up a well needed spell slot (or 2).<P>2) Religion.  Yeah most of the enc quests are geared towards the fact that we can illusion to go places.  Well I'm not agnostic, and chose a religion to add color to my character.  When I first started my character no matter what I chose, it said it was a difficult combination (including agnostic).  Well that wasn't true then, and it isn't true now.  Not being agnostic is WAY harder on an enc.  To the point where I couldn't even finish the quest for illusion iksar!  Certain parts of my epic quest are darn near impossible, if not impossible.  Try going into FV with any illusion and whap, whap, whap yer dead.  Even going in with invis doesn't help, I've already died 4 times just trying to talk to a vendor.  Allow us to hide our religion via an illusion, or allow us to change our religion via cleric, a temple, or quest.  I'm level 51 now, and I have no intention of starting over again.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As a level 60 enchanter I don't think much - if anything at all - requires changing.<P>For the person that said Boon of the Garou can only be kept up on one person - that is incorrect. It has a duration of 6 minutes and recast of 3 minutes. It can be kept up on two people simulanteously will little effort.<P>I never had a problem with the charmed mobs in Kael not responding to my commands...<P>I find Memory Flux at level 55 just doesn't work. I used it all the way from 55 to level 60 and it just does not work. Even if cast three times before a mes broke the monster still hated me with a vengeance, and at 350 mana per cast, I would want some chance for it to work after spending 1050 mana. I have resorted to reoccuring amnesia which only costs 100 mana and works much better! Others say the spell does not recur, however it has a much greater success rate.<P>The ONLY ilusion I would like to see is Froglok Illusion, so we can jump and spin like those frogloks do when they cast. LOL that would be just too cool imo.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>PLEASE leave Gift of Brilliance as it is =)<P>That's it.

</FONT><HR>Ok, we know Illusion:Target is out due to programming conflicts, but what about something like Illusion:Region?<P>Each zone has a specific form in it for the enchanter to turn into.  For example, in Eastern Wastes you can turn into a Snow Dervish and get 10CR; in Cobalt Scar you can turn into an Othmir and get enduring breath; in Field of Bone you turn into an Iksar Skeleton; in South Ro you turn into a Sand Giant and get bash, etc.<P>Wouldn't this solve some of the programming problems?  Instead of going into each zone and telling everything in it when to be KoS to an enchanter when he is in what form, you can simplify it and tell all the NPCs to be KoS to you in Illusion:Region form in S Ro, but indifferent to you in Cobalt Scar.<P>To simplify this even more you could make it so it is outdoors only?<P>Just a thought...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok here is a spell line i have never heard of.  Its a "slow" spell that Increases the targets spell casting duration.<P>There is a spell that slows attack speed, and movement, so why not a slow spell that "slows" the targets ability to cast spells?  <P>Sounds like a pretty interesting line of spells to me.  Having a progression of these new types of spells can start at lvl 16 by INCREASING the targets spell casting duration by some 30%, and in the end, as much as a 60% increase in spell cast duration.<P>Just an opinion</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I know this has been mentioned in a few ways, but I would like to put it in mine…<P>MOB Hate List<BR>1. Bard<BR>2. Enchanter<BR>3. Cleric<P>Number 1 and 3 are in PLATE. I don’t want to see plate clad chanters running about but a little AC could be thrown our way by means of spells, class AC bonus, equipment, or higher defense skill level caps.<P>Unlike other casters, we strive to hit 200 Intelligence as well as 200 Charisma. All other casters obtain their 200 INT and then move on to AC/HP and resist gear. This leaves us as the weaklings of the group that happen to be on top of the agro list. In a lot of situations, the Cleric has little time and can afford no mistakes when we get attacked.<P>PETS<BR>All I have to say is that the new duel wielding system was annoying hit to us. We are the only ones who must encumber ourselves if we wish to cast duel-wielding pets. Make capable pets spawn with 2 weapons or use another animation.<P>Deities<BR>It seems that the game was designed to discourage deities for Enchanters. As a follower of Marr, I have found that I can get by with a little extra work. However, things like Epic Weapons appear to be impossible (I'm currently trying to find a work around). I would also like to have something to show for all that extra work I have put in.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 16 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-11.html">11</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-12.html">12</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-13.html">13</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-14.html">14</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-15.html">15</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-16.html">16</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052139&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052139&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
