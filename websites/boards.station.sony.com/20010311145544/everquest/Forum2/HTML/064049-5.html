</FONT><HR>Excellent post. Clear, concise, and well thought out. Its a shame Verant will write it off to exactly what you are trying to avoid. Kewl-d00d uber l33t player or some such.<P>There is only one flaw in your entire schema. What you propose costs money. Money talks and Verant would rather line their pockets with the quick easy buck and push their customers away than take a proactive stance and work with their customers to improve their game, as well as their profits in the long run.<P>Either way, was a good post with good intentions.

</FONT><HR>Well, seems that 3 days have passed now, and no response from a blue name. I guess we should have known better. They appear to focus on things that will not affect the vast majority of us, and ignore the things that affect all of us.<P>I started this game 4 months ago. I knew next to nothing about the game, and decided to start what I thought would be an all powerful wizard. At level 5, I gave up on it. I died constantly, and couldnt even kill low blue things regularly. I decided to try to create a character that would be able to cast spells, and live at the same time, and after reading up in the manual that came with the game, I decided that maybe a Barbarian Shaman could fit the bill. That shaman is level 50 now. <P>The first 40 levels were alot of fun. Then it became obvious that I wasnt able to keep up with alot of groups healing needs. Yet that is the role I was asked to fill the vast majority of the time. By 45, it was painfully obvious.<P>Tonight, I was asked to be the healer in Karnors Castle. We did ok for awhile, and then the warrior got killed while pulling. While we were seaching for a cleric to come into the zone to rez him since there were none there, we got trained. I was chain casting heals on the other group members, but I could not keep them all alive, and in the end, we lost 2 more. <P>A few months ago, in the original talk thread, the shaman one, we pleaded and begged for Superior Healing to be lowered to level 44 or even 49. I saw dozens of requests from shaman for this. I believe I also saw a couple of posts saying 51 would be ok, but the vast majority of the shaman posting were asking for Superior Heal at 44 or 49. Since we got Greater Heal at 29, going to 53 without any increase in healing abilities a very long time to go without.<P>Someone at Verant decided to ignore the majority of us that were talking from experience playing the game, and simply moved Superior Healing from 53 to 51. I call that a stinking placebo. <P>There are now 2 corpses laying in Karnors Castle that would not be there had they done what we asked them to do. But they refuse to listen to us. They refuse to believe that we want this to be the best game that it could be. They ignore us.<P>And then they wonder why we get frustrated and upset with them.<P>The answer should be so painfully obvious to them. But they are blind.<P>I have seen statements from them to the effect that if they listened to us, we would all choose to make the game "easy" and then we would all get bored with the game. BS! I love a challenge, and that is part of why I play this game. However, when a shaman has to go 23 (as it was), or now 21 levels without any increase in healing capabilities, that is not challenging. that is stupid game design. These are the very levels where the melee players actually begin to get items and skills that dramatically boost their HP, and when the mobs dramatically scale upwards both in HP and in damage delt.<P>I know that some of you will say "Hey, when you level next, you will finally get your superior healing, so whats the problem?". The problem is that Verant failed to listen to us. We play this game. We know it better than anyone else. I suspect we know it better from a players point of view than even they do. We try hard to get them to listen to us. But they wont.<P>I have alot better things to do than to sit here writing a novel like this, which is simply going to be appended to the bottom of what is already a book. But I honestly believe that if Verant would listen to us, engage us, and discuss things with us, that in the end, we would understand each other better, and we would both end up with a better game, and we the customers would be much happier. And I could quit writing long posts like this.<P>I remember the post about 6 weeks ago where Absor told us that no patches would be done for a couple weeks, and that on February 9th, the would begin to discuss the changes for all the classes. Its March now. As far as we know, nothing has even been discussed. The few posts that even touch on the subject seem to indicate that it hasnt even occured yet. <P>I work for a medium sized company. We have a CS department that deals with customers all day long. I have been with this company for 2 years now. 4 months ago, I felt that we had to have the worst CS in the world. Verant has changed my mind. Compared to Verant, our customer service department is a marvel. If we did to customers what Verant does, we would literally get sued off the face of the earth. Yes, I know Verant is supporting a game. The company I work for is not supporting a game. There are clear differences. But CS for the most part is the same thing everywhere, no matter what your product is. CS means CUSTOMER SERVICE. The way we get ignored on here, you really wonder at times if Verant doesnt really feel that CS means CUSTOMERS S**K.<P>Day 4 for this thread is now here. How much do you want to bet that it will end as the first three have. No blue names will post, and nothing will change. The broken quests, zones that screw up your framerate so bad you cant move, pathing that sucks so bad you cannot use pets, spells that get resisted so often that they dont even get cast, bugs that cause players to loose items that they have spent weeks or sometimes even months to get will poof, mobs that poof after you and your groupS (yes capital S) have done 100% of the damage to will poof when you kill them, mass link deaths on raids, zone crashes, boats that cant dock right, trade skills that dont work, etc will all continue to happen. But Verant has the time to add /Gems to the game. They have time to add newbie zones to the game in zones that are virtually unused.<P>This could be an AWESOME game. But since they wont listen to us, its an ok one. And instead of the customers being happy customers, we will continue to ***** and moan until either they do decide to make serious changes, or something better comes out.<P>Which will it be Verant?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Excellent post EuroEQ.  But I am quite certain you will receive no response.  Though I don't think it's because they're pulling a ostrich routine on us.  I mean, when you stop and think about it and put aside the frustration which usually prompts most of us to come here and voice our ideas and thoughts, you have to wonder how could they not respond to this?  How could they not say at least something?  Right?<P>So when I sit back and ask myself that, and set aside my normal set of emotions which prompt me to come here, I have to conclude it's because they can't.  Can't as in not allowed to.  VI already has shown many times to have near Nazi like attitudes when it comes to enforcing their rules.  Sometimes I agree with it, sometimes I don't, and I could tolerate it a lot better if it were consistent and across the board, but it's not.<P>In a game like this, where time sinks are part of the design, the "challenge factor" takes the upper 10% player base as it's average factor, and CS is more a Teacher/Misbehaving student relationship, you're bound to have a product that ultimately goes to ground.  Why do I say Teacher/Misbehaving Student relationship?  Well, a Parent/Child relation has at it's core (usually) love.  Teachers don't necassarily love the children they teach, it's a job and when a misbehaving student becomes part of the job aggravation, it's very easy to level draconian 'discipline' their way.<P>Anyway EuroEQ, you have an excellent post and set of ideas.  But I don't believe any Blue Name will respond because I honestly believe two things about this.  1)  They're not allowed to, the same sort of draconian rules that restrict our behavior restrict theirs, it's rarely fair and quick with punitive action.  2) They don't really have any intention or desire to see this game continue to survive.  I'm sure it's left as bad of a taste in their mouth as it has ours, and it's easier to just let this beast die a slow and painful death while working on something else.<P>Like many others, and more than most, once the competition hits the net I'm gone.  There is simply too much aggravation in this game for it to be able to justify the time it likes to lay claim to.  I understand it's a massive project, I really do.  And I'd be willing to put up with bugs, broken zones, loot, skills, ect, if I were left to feel as if I and my fellow players mattered at all.  But I don't.  I have had good expierences with Guides and GMs, they're not the source of my ire or frustration.  It's higher up than that, and those higher management types regard me (I feel) with contempt.  <P>To a certain extent I understand their feelings, having to deal with the horde of kids that are sometimes storming the castle has got to wear on even a saint's nerves.  But at the same time, if you like your house and all the pretty things in it you have to remember who funds all that stuff.  It isn't the company that employs them, it's the customers who buy the product the company sells.  If the product doesn't sell anymore, the paycheck drys up.  Simple as that.  <P>We'd all love to see EQ realize it's potential, but I think the hard reality is that EQ, much like UO, pioneered a new form of entertainment and in the process will make the kind of mistakes that spells it's doom as other competitors learn from said mistakes and work harder to avoid them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>EuroEQ wrote:<P>&gt;"I think you all have created a great game. I'm sure you have also been well rewarded for your ingenuity and hard work. I don't know if the size of those rewards have made you complacent like wealthy linebackers who seem to avoid taking the risks that were taken by their predecessors, but something has gone horribly a miss."&lt;<P>No, we are not content with our success.  We want you to keep playing after the competition has come and gone.  And we know that we have to work to earn that.  But if you'd like to pay me a few million every three years, I could learn to get complacent…<P>&gt;"A little context."&lt;<P>I am willing to accept your words at face value.  Nobody here ever needs to give me credentials.<BR> <BR>&gt;"Please, do not get defensive, but in my humble opinion, your customer service is woeful. "How can that be? We have such a high retention rate. Things must be pretty good." <BR>Can you do queries on your user logs to determine how many of those accounts are still being used by original owners?"&lt;<P>Well, considering that transferring an account is against our rules…<P>&gt;"Here is my hypothesis. Few accounts are truly canceled. Many are either sold on Ebay or absorbed into a guild. I know the guild with whom I play is supporting at least 1/2 dozen "canceled" accounts since they provide good utility in terms of "porting", "resurrections," "mez-on-demand," etc."&lt;<P>Again, such things are against the UELA (I think that's the acronym).<P>&gt;"Many people who play your game are, quite frankly, addicted. I do not disparage them but this subset of your customer-base is largely unaffected by poor customer service. They will argue and complain, but do little else. However, when a suitable alternative to your product is available, they will likely shift their addiction in that direction. What about Ashron's call? Quite frankly, that game, from what I hear, doesn't hold a candle to what EQ was (pre expansions) It just wasn't good enough to peel away your customer base."&lt;<P>Fair enough.  I'll accept that there are customers (and not just customers of Verant, but just customers in general) that will be satisfied with very little customer service.  I will also concede that there are a group of players that have already reached the end of their time with our game and will move on when a suitable alternative comes along.  But I would argue that their reactions have little to do with customer service, and everything to do with the kind of customers they are (neither good nor bad, just their nature).  Some people will move on to the next best thing regardless of what we do, and others have played themselves out on EverQuest.  We do our best to retain these people, obviously.<P>&gt;"I think the major issues with the game came when you expanded the characters beyond lvl 50 in an enviornment that was never designed to support it. You have major balance issues between melee and casters because of the wealth of melee items and the relative scarcity of both spells and caster items."&lt;<P>I disagree.  I think that the environment could support extended levels.  Though I readily admit that the implementation of those extended levels wasn't perfect.  That does not reflect the ability of the game to support such expansion.  It only exposes the fact that we need to work more on making it work.  We've already made several strides to reach that goal, and I think we'll have it all fixed up soon enough.<P>&gt;"I am starting to delv into the minutia and that is not my intent so let me raise my points up a level. <BR>I think you are doing a terrible job of communicating with your customers. I am a customer and that is my perception. Many here seem to have the same perception. Perceptions of one's customers is reality...trust me it is. Your customers feel you are adversarial with them. They believe that you think they will destroy "your" game with their unbalanced ideas. Perhaps you are right...but they (we) are the customers so how do you communicate your concerns while answering ours."&lt;<P>I'll have to take your word on that.  I don't see that myself, but then again I work here.  But I talk to customers a lot, and I get a different feeling about it. <P>&gt;"I'd like to offer a couple suggestions and then provide a small case-study to illustrate why the implementation of such suggestions (or ones similar) are needed. <BR>I think Alan's idea for "Talk" threads was a good one. That said, I do not believe Verant Management provided him the support or infrastructure to make that good idea successful. This confuses me. If Verant's data is accurate then you have approximately 300,000 active accounts which equates to about $3 Million dollars in revenue monthly plus revenue from the sale of retail boxes at $16 - $50 each. Surely, even after expenses and R&D, there are enough funds to provide a robust and thoughtful customer support engine."&lt;<P>I'm not in a position to argue company revenue with anyone.<P>&gt;"I suggest that one member of your current staff be assigned as advocate to each class. Such a person should have as their mission in life to understand the wants and needs of that segment of customer."&lt;<P>So you are suggesting that we add another duty to each member of the dev team that they read all the class sites and become experts in the play of a certain class (which, it seems, would also require that they play that class up to 60th level on a live server)?  They already do that.  Every one of us plays the game.  Members of the dev team play as many hours as anyone.  And to insist that they spend their work time becoming activists for a certain class is rather silly.  I think they should be developing content myself.<P>&gt;"Each class should have an interactive page on the EQ website through which to see a regularly updated status on their issues."&lt;<P>I would argue that there aren't so many 'issues' as you seem to think.  To keep up the kind of interaction you seem to want would be a full-time job.<P>&gt;"You might say that you already have such advocates as part of your tuning team. Great! Tell us who they are. Have them engage us. You don't know how lucky you are to have a vibrant customer base that WANTS to tell you what they think. Most companies have to pay 3rd parties to find quasi-interested pseudo-customers who then provide their input...for a fee."&lt;<P>Heh, yes, I do say that we already have designers playing the game.  But to call them advocates would be wrong.  You see, and advocate is narrowly focused.  His (or her) only desire or job is to push through narrow objectives.  We can't do that.  We have to look at the entire game.  Narrowing your focus to just one class is counterproductive.<P>&gt;"These 14 folks would, of course, also have to maintain the objectivity one would expect of a Verant employee as opposed to a purist player. The "good-of-the-game" would temper the natural desire to advance the position of their advocacy group beyond what is reasonable."&lt;<P>Ah, sheesh, maybe I should read one paragraph ahead before responding…<P>Here's where you'll have to trust me.  An advocate that is objective and looks for the good of the game, would be unable to please the players that truly feel that they need an advocate.  If a player points out a problem and is logical about the problem, he doesn't need an advocate.  That problem is a problem, regardless of the class of the player.<P>I've spent a lot of time lately getting to know the desires of the players that identify themselves with a particular class.  I've written up those desires, purposefully excluding the ones that did not take into account the good of the game.  And yet, as is obvious by your post, I am not considered an 'advocate' for any of them.  Why is that?  I have done as you have described.  I have listened to the players, responded to them (over a longer period of time than I would have if I was only dealing with one class), and listed their concerns.  I have been an 'advocate' as you described.<P>And yet, you clearly do not see me as such.<P>*shrug*<P>&gt;"The ideas put forth by the 14 would be managed similar to how Alan has started the "talk" threads, but much more actively so. Part of this open communication would include time lines and thoughts in process. I know companies think of their project plans as some kind of top secret document. "We can't share that with our customers; what if we miss our projected timelines?" &lt;<P>Perhaps some do.  We communicate them as we get them, for the most part.  Sure, we keep some things secret because we truly believe that discovery is part of the game.  The only thing that your advocate group could do better than one person could do (and I know, I'm that one person), is react more quickly to their… constituents.  But the dev team is busy.  Their work has to be done.  If we added another duty to them, that of advocacy, then you might get faster responses, but they would be responses like, "well, I spent my morning responding to your e-mails and discussing your concerns with you on the message board, so I didn't have time to code in the changes you asked for…"<P>I don't see that as a better way to do things.<P>&gt;"I would just love to see the look on one of my customer's faces if I told them I would not share my team's project schedule. Communicate with us; tell us what's up. If you miss a date...so what."&lt;<P>Wow.  You either have never missed a date, or you just don't pay attention to the response from customers when you do.  I don't mean to be harsh here, but you're out of touch.  Nothing will get people more upset than missing a deadline.<P>But that's not the reason that we don't spend our time posting up each and every deadline.<P>&gt;"It's a game to us, not a mission critical enterprise application."&lt;<P>Er… ok.  But if it's just a game to you, then why do you need all this information.  Why in the world would you need an advocate of all things, if it's just a game…<P>This is where the problem comes in.  For us, this is a business.  We have to take into account things like workload, priorities and such, for the whole project at hand.  An individual player might only have interest in changes that affect him.  So that player's desires will almost never match up with our timeline.  It can't, no matter what we do.<P>&gt;"Tell us why its going to be delayed and give us a new date. You know, I bet dimes to donuts that if the high-powered healing items were discussed in an open forum, even in general terms so as not to ruin the excitement, the uncomfortable issues you now face would have been avoided."&lt;<P>We do that now.  There is no timeline about your class that you do not already know about.  I've made a list, and we're looking at it.  That's the timeline.  Once we look at it, we'll let you know what's next.  Nothing hidden here.  I imagine that the problem is that we're not moving real fast on the issue that concerns the individual.  We can't help that, we have to prioritize over the whole organization, not just one class.<P>&gt;"So, to recap. <BR>1) Verant employed, class specific, advocates."&lt;<P>We're not hiring fourteen new people to do this.  Our dev team is too busy (as they should be).  It's my job to try to be those fourteen people.  And I can do it, I just can't do it as fast as fourteen people can.<P>&gt;"2) Such advocates are either members of, or have significant input to, the tuning team."&lt;<P>They do.<P>&gt;"3) All issues managed by advocates are communicated and over-communicated to the interested community via class specific, verant managed, web pages."&lt;<P>Again, we don't think it's a good idea to hire fourteen new people to do this, and the ones we have are working on making the changes that you've asked for, rather than talking about them.<P>&gt;"4) Time lines for resolution to issues are published and any slippage communicated in a timely manner."&lt;<P>Again, I do that.  It's just not happening as fast as you'd like.<P>[Much stuff about necromancers snipped.]<P>&gt;"COMMUNICATE. State it. Tell us, "Ok...there are some problems with your class. We are committed to fixing them. It will take some time. Susan here is your primary contact at Verant and she will be working on your behalf. We will get all your ideas down and then follow-up with some dates and next steps. We will at least have the next steps posted for your feedback by date XYZ."&lt;<P>Um…<P>Here's where we have a problem.  It's a pretty simple one, really.  I have listed the problems that the classes have given me.  We don’t know if we are committed to fixing all of them (or any of them) until we actually look them over and decide if they are indeed problems.  You tell me that we should trust our customers.  But, well, I know that you don't trust all of your fellow players to tell the absolute truth, or to look at the situation from a neutral place, for the good of the game.  Sure, most do.  But we still have to look at each idea and make certain that it is a problem and that the suggested solution works for the game as a whole. <P>So once we have taken a look at the list that I have compiled and decided which ones we are going to act on and which we are not, then I will come back to you with a revised list.  No, I will not be listing dates.  I think you are completely wrong about dates being a good idea.  I'll certainly give timeframes, but they will be approximate.<P>&gt;"Guys...this is basic business here. You will have amazed and delighted customers. You will develop loyalty that will enable you to retain customers through the release of "the next best thing." <BR>Brad...when was the last time you delighted a customer? Why do people pay 2x as much to get a shirt at Nordstrom? Because Nordstrom strives every day to delight every customer. OMG..my dog ate my shirt and I have a meeting in Chicago; what am I going to do? As your checking into your hotel all stressed out, the clerk hands you a package from Nordstrom with a shirt, your size, in it,having been told of your dilemma and expressing the item to the hotel at no additional charge. This is not B.S. this happened. If Macy's has a sale on shirts tomorrow; will you see me there; hell no!"&lt;<P>But we don't charge twice the price…  I suppose if we did, then we could double the size of the EQLive team and hire people to be advocates.  But that does not mean that our current system isn't good.  I'm going to defend it, and only partially because that system is me.  Even if there were fourteen people running around here insisting that changes be made to their class, the dev team would still have to sit down and evaluate the ideas presented.  They are still going to have to get their daily tasks done.  There is still going to be time between a request and a response.<P>As for amazing the customer, there's a problem with the advocate idea in that regard.  Once the classes are 'balanced' the advocates are done.  Perhaps these advocates would provide a sense of wonder about our customer relations for a while.  But we can't continue to have an advocate for something like that once they've done their work.  So what would we have to do next to bring that kind of wonder to the customers?<P>I agree that it would be a great thing to be able to hire your advocates.  But it's impractical from a business standpoint.  And when they were done there would be no practical way to keep up that level of interaction, and no real need.  Yes, everyone wants to be heard.  And we listen as best we can.  But we can't have someone go to every customer's house and get their opinions first hand, either…<P>It's all about reasonable expectations.  We meet those whenever we can.  But we can't meet the unreasonable ones, even in the short term because we couldn't keep meeting them, and that would be a disappointment to our customers too.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan,<P>Very nice response. I just want to bring up one problem that I have.<P>&gt;As for amazing the customer, there's a problem with the advocate idea in that regard. Once the classes are 'balanced' the advocates are done.&lt;<P>You (as a company) have stated over and over again that EQ is an ever-changing and evolving project. Given that fact (that you're going to be adding new content, etc, etc) the work of 'balancing' will never be done.<P>Please do not think that... Unless I have missed an argument to the contrary, evolution itself could cause things to get out of wack *down the road*.<P>Just my 2cp.<P>Vayanla &lt;Arcane Legacy&gt;<BR>60th Dark Elf High Priestess, RodcetNife<BR>Member of The Alliance<BR>EQSS News Staff (http://eq.stratics.com) </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064049-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064049.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064049-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064049-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064049-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064049-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064049-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=064049&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=064049&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
