</FONT><HR>Coming from someone who actually has a knowledge of the Asian martial arts, and from a more realistic role-playing perspective, I think it would make more sense to allow monk characters to CHOOSE a more defensive or offensive focus when they first create a character.  My reasoning behind this suggestion follows: most martial arts have either a "defensive" focus (i.e., aikido) or an "offensive" focus (i.e., karate, tae kwon do, five animals fist, etc.).  Why not allow players to choose their skills focus (their "style", if you will), effectively allowing more powerful offensive or defensive effects without making the monk class too powerful.<BR>Of course, this may just be wishful thinking, as making such sweeping changes to the class may be too difficult this late in the game.  Of course, you could always add more "martial artist" classes/subclasses in a later release...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Mulamasi's post on allowing criticals with fist attacks makes a lot of sense.  The Shaolin and Taoist monks that the EQ monk class is modeled after were also healers, and applied that knowledge to self-defense.  If it could be balanced, criticals and stuns make for good RPG character enhancement for monks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A few things to consider when trying to decide if Monks SHOULD be equal or better than rogues in offense.<P>Monks attack, they can't tank and their only added abilities beyond attacking are Feign Death and Instill doubt.  Monk defenses are not superior to hardly any of the melee classes.<P>The only bonus to playing a monk would seem to be that you are not equipment dependant, except now with these Kunark and Velious "improvements" we are completely dependant on equipment to keep our damage output high enough to make us worth grouping with.<P>How do you feel if you are a class that cant tank, is not spectacular in defense and is ranked 3rd in damage and only has 2 other abilities to play with besides punching people?<P>You feel like a monk.<P>My suggestion is make us less equipment dependant.  I love the idea that a previous poster stated, give us the ability to choose a superior fighting style or a superior defensive style.  You could even make it like the Magician focus quests for their pets.<P>The sash and headband quests are horrible.  They are in line with the original vision of everquest when all things magical were supposed to be very rare.  It just turns out that a fantasy world with all magic items was quite boring.  Now that magic is proliforating through the land, they really need to be revamped.<P>Human monk versus Iksar monk.  I have to question the viability of human monks.  Their only apparent bonus is the exp penalty being absent.<BR>Please compare the two:  <BR>  1)  Iksar.  3pt regen bonus, infravision, superior newbie grounds, superior armor quests and equipment.  Inferior faction adjustments, small exp penalty.<BR>  2)  Human.  No exp penalty. can't see at night penalty.<P>I can't stress how much regen matters to any melee class. You may think that not having infravision is not a penalty, but it is.  When you choose a class that does not have slef infravision in some manner, it increases the difficulty of the game extraordinarily.  <P>So the iksar really has 3 bonuses and 2 penalties while the human has 1 bonus and 1 penalty.  Doesn't sound so bad till you look at the actual bonuses and penalties.  Faction can be modified and worked around.  Getting an item with infravision is NOT easy.  My human monk is lvl 23 and still doesn't have one, it is very hard to play at night.  And considering the frequency of "bad weather" it is practically night time 75% of the time in EQ.<P>These are inbalances within the monk class itself.  Human monks are just too inferior to Iksar, the Iksar even get better stats..the ones that matter to the Monk anyway.  I've heard rumor that human monk skill caps are a little higher than Iksar skill caps.  If that is so, that is a nice bonus....once you are in your 40's???  that's a bit of a long time to wait for something to show itself.  <P>So I ask that you not only look at balancing the monk versus other classes, but the monk versus itself as well.<P>Another thing to look at.  All mobs get a defensive bonus when they frenzy.  I really find this offensive in the fact that it seems targeted toward starting trains and basically requiring you to have someone who can snare.  For an example, take any character and go fight a mob that is a tough fight, but that you can solo.  Now, watch what happens when the mob gets to 2 bars of life.  Suddenly it starts dishing out higher damage more frequently, now watch what happens when the mob decides to run.  You start missing horribly.  I have chaced mobs for very long distances because suddenly my blows just mysteriously stopped landing.<P>All classes except the warrior suffer AGI penalties when they drop below a certain amount of life, this lowers their AC and skills.  Warriors seem immune to that effect as does every single mob in the game, from snow bunnies to giants.  This really needs to be looked at.  Maybe I am just taking a dark view of things, but its only purpose seems to be to allow the mob a higher chance to get away and alert others, causing a train and death for the party.  This is true even when the mob is snared, it turns to flee, cant run and you STILL can't hit the sucker.<P>Suggestion:  If you can't up our damage and you can't up our defense, then how about upping our accuracy in attacks?  Yes this makes us do more damage, but in quantity not in individual strikes...just a thought.<P><BR>Vordai.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Monk quests- By far the most time consuming.<P>Robe of the Lost Circle average seems to be 60-80 hours.  Someone mentioned that you can kill the Monk NPC and get the robe.  Not that easy, you need 3 well balanced groups of tanks and healers (NPC quad hits fast and hard).<P>Robe of the Whistling Fist took me over 60 hours to complete.  Seems to be the average.<P>CF might seem easier then most others, but if you think about it for a second, every epic MoB people need can be taken down with 2-3 well balanced groups.  The final fight for Monks is hardly easy.  I have seen 3 full groups get owned.  Think about this, Monks have 3 MoB's to kill during final fight, Cleric/Rogues both have a single MoB to kill.  I think the point beeing made should be that there aren't many steps to the quest to compair with some of the other epics.<P>I know your sick of seeing this, but add a minimum to Flying Kick like Rogues have for backstab lvl/2?  Pretty sad when we FK for 3 but a rogue can BS for half their level.  Max damage for FK theoretically should compair to Rogue BS.  Rogues with their epic can BS for over 1k damage while our max FK barely reaches 230.<P>I would really like to see monks going back to their fists, I think RoK weaps really messed things up.  Either slightly increasing damage or reducing delay would entice most monks to return to their roots and use their fists.<P>I am embarassed to use my Thunderkick disc.  For the life of me I cant see why there isn't a set minimum for this.  My average TK for the last 3 days has been 50-60 hardly ever going above 120 which is my max Flying Kick damage.  Does that make sense?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>A few points<P>Stun effect - i feel that a stun of some sort should be available to ALL classes when they attack with a bare hand or kick. Implemented much as the critial attack is for warriors. This will lessen the "need" a lot of young monks seem to have to acquiring weapons as soon as possible and never using fists. Would also be good for ALL classes while doing a naked corpse recovery run. The stun effect would ONLY occur on those hands or feet USED in combat and would NOT happen if a weapon was weilded (one weapon would mean your empty hand has a chance though of performing a stun). The stun effect could be implemented so it only worked once per 3 fights on average (or something similar). It shouldn't be a monk only ability though as everyone has a random chance in real life of landing a perfect punch while flailing madly :)<P>Triple Attack<BR>This is an interesting notion and would certainly fit into the roleplay aspect of a blindingly fast martial artist :) However some would see it as giving us an instant 50% boost to our attack damage. To counter that the triple attack would be an automatic ability that is only used if BOTH hands are empty (make it a high level skill too so that its only gained at maybe 45). Weilding one or two weapons would negate the triple attack and we'd just be double attacking like normal. Also while triple attack is in use we could expend stamina faster (since we'd be more energetic) and once stamina is down to 20% (1 bub) left we'd stop triple attacking and only SINGLE attack (not double!). From a roleplay point of view this would equate to a fighter being so worn out they'd have one hand on their knee/leg bent over slightly catching their breathe but still able to swing with their free arm. It could become the monk equivalent of OOM in long fights ;) OOS!<P>Mend Other<BR>I'd love to see us given the chance, once our mend level is at say 150 (since most skills don't seem to actually improve at all above 100 lets make use of that extra 100 points that we earn :) that we gain a Mend Other ability. This skill would be a seperate skill (instead of adding a target feature to our mend... it would be too dangerous and slow to a player that way) but it would recycle perhaps every 10min instead of 6 and while its recycling we CAN'T use mend on ourselves. So we can use only one at a time and long recycle times mean we aren't a threat to healers in groups, it just becomes an emergency heal that can be applied. Roleplay wise it would be the conditioned martial artist able to gather and project lifeforce/chi to heal externally (someone else) rather than internally (for ourselves).<P>Disarm<BR>Really, what is the point of this skill at the moment! Mines around 200 and after a dozen disarm attempts on a lowly orc it still has its weapon (and dies to my riposte (yippee a skill at works :)) Make disarm work more effectively.. pretty much a guaranteed disarm on a sub lv10 mob for a lv50-60 char... through to a difficult chance for even cons up to a slim chance for red cons. I think at present its not possible to disarm certain weapons (magic? stat?) from mobs which would be understandable. However add a fumble effect instead.. so if its not possible to disarm a certain weapon but the disarm skill "works" then the mob (and players in a duel) will fumble their attack and lose that attack round (or just that attack) while the opponant regains a grip on their weapon again. It's not quite a full stun effect in that they can still attack with their second hand if they dual weild and still kick. Not sure if it would be something to cause a caster to stop though, perhaps only if the caster is weilding an item.<P>Thunderkick<BR>You land a thunderous kick for 8 points of damage. More like a whimper. Thunderkick should have a minimum damage level of perhaps 50-80 so that it can still do more or less than a normal kick but will do a guaranteed amount.. after all the thunderkick is applied on our first SUCCESSFUL kick after using the skill, so the kick has already landed and now just needs the bonus Thunderkick applies to it. Disciplines have long recycle times so they should also be better than a regular skill since they are added onto the regular skills. Perhaps Thunderkick = Flying Kick damage (of the successful attack) + 50-80HP damage.<P>Thanks<P>Pelmen<BR>Lv54 monk of Brell<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just a note on my perspective of removing the ability to kill the brothers for Robe of the Lost Circle.  I play a 51 Iksar monk.<P>There is no way I will do the Epic quest if I can not kill for the robe.  Why?  Unlike humans (who from experience are the only ones really complaining about this) iksar have to gain faction to do the sash and headband quests.  I'm not going to spend hundreds of hours getting faction so I can do head band quest.  The amount of time it would take an iksar to get faction for the sashes and headbands is greater than the time required for a human monk to do raster, targin, zephyl, and qwinn (which is still an insane amount of time).<P>Getting the guild together to kill one of the brothers isn't always easy either.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You know, in this, and the other class 'talks', I've seen a lot of commentary on the post-50 game. On the flip side of the coin, almost nothing about levels 1-30 or so. As such, I'll address a few points I think could be of use.<P>Weight limit: No problems here, in my opinion. The penalty in the early game isn't a huge deterrant to being 5-10 overweight. Probably gets much greater, later on.<P>Weaponry: I can't really think of anything easily affordable in the 1hb or 2hb weapons department that's any good for level 15-30 or so. Fighting Batons (on Rodcet Nife, anyway) go for around 600-1k pp, depending on who's selling. Adamantite Bo Sticks are around 4-600, I believe. The fact that there's very little between the high end and low end Monk weapon choices was an excellent point, and I'd like to commend the folks who brought it up.<P>Skills: To whomever suggested that the Kick and Strike attacks be de-linked from each other, a hearty, YES YES YES! ;) Round Kick becomes totally useless within 1 level of getting Tiger Claw, as TC is faster (by far), and does an equal amount of damage within 2-3 levels of obtaining it. The current system of special attacks means that once you get your newest special, the others fall from the hotkey list, because the new ones quickly outrank the old. Keeping up those older skills would be accomplished wonderfully by making the Strike/Claw attacks independent of the Kick attacks.<P>It's been pointed out that it may be beneficial for Monks to have a stun attack. Absor singled out one person on his post to EQVault, and mentioned that without reasons, it likely won't make the list. I'll provide some. ;)<P>For lacking of better terminology, Monks get their a**es handed to them by caster mobs. A equal level caster WILL absolutely destroy a Monk in combat, as the Monk has no way (besides blind luck) to interrupt casting. <P>Round Kick - if you'd just been punted in the side of the head, wouldn't you be a bit stunned? :) (-very- short one.. maybe 1 sec? After all, skellies have this at a level of 5-6, right?)<P>Dragon Punch - Same animation as Tiger Claw, and only marginally more damage... possibly give it a bit more oomph. Make it something that Monks look forward to, rather than hang their heads in disdain.<P>Having just obtained Feign Death with my current char, I tried it out a bit. Three successful feigns on a mob that conned -very- green, and it remained agro on me even afterwards. Aroo? I thought FD was supposed to wipe agro. Was I mistaken? :)<P>Religions: Not a balance issue, but rather an RP issue. I for one think it'd be kinda cool to have a Human Monk who follows Rallos Zek. (Warrior Monks, anyone?) Open up a couple more dieties our beloved class, just for the possible RP values, for those of us who do RP from time to time, or all the time. :) There's easily a couple other dieties that I could see a Monk rallying behind.<P>And on a totally unrelated note: How the heck do you parry a punch? :) (Go ahead! Flame me for this one! :)<P>Thanks much for the great info gathering threads, Absor, and all of the folks who've posted to the respective class talks!<P>-Jay<BR>aka<BR>Insert &lt;Crusaders of Mithril&gt;<BR>Initiate of the 17th Circle<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Just because we can spread the  doing of the quest acrost all 51 levels.. instead of trying to do it all in one week, does not mean it is easy. I have yet to get the Celestial fist.. heck..

I fully support Zads reply after yours Absor.. and please, if you are going to give us a critical.. dont have it be throwing. It is a heavy weapon (.5 pounds to carry throwiing weapons, and yes, I do notice this), please have it on a attack, or fists.

</FONT><HR>Just a point about shiverback armor, the only piece of shiverback I own is a bracer which has been banked since I got it. Why? Because Symbol of Loyalty to vox is better. The low AC on shiverback makes it almost worthless in the average encounter. The only time I ever considdered finishing my set of shiverback was just for arms/legs for the fire/cold resist.<P>Shiverback is terrible, it has the same ammount of AC as caster armor and we can get much better items 20-30 levels before we're even planes capable.<P>Here's a short list...<P>- Head: Hatar drops a 10ac 10sv fire hat, he's fairly low level and since there is no shiverback...<BR>- Legs: Gatorscale are better than shiverback because of the low AC, can be camped at level 30.<BR>- Arms: Azure sleeves are MUCH better than shiverback, campable at level 30<BR>- Gloves: Treant fists or gem inlaid gloves, level 25 quest or lower<BR>- Bracers: Symbol of loyalty to vox, campable at level 30<BR>- Tunic: Robe of lost circle, level 40ish. Since it's required for the epic almost all monks are working on the quest anyway and I'd rather camp Raster for a couple weeks than die multiple times in fear.<BR>- Boots:... well... perhaps the only decent piece of shiverback...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Id like to mention something.  I see alot of wishlists out there.  Alot of them are saying what would be 'ideal' if they added.  Alot of these infringe on the other classes.<P>One point in general.  I keep hearing about iksars and humans, iksars have more ac, iksars regen much faster.  This is true.  <P>But you keep asking for more human ac, hp, skills etc, and your missing the point.  You dont have a exp penalty like the iksars, if you get the vision, regen, ac, you will also get the exp penalty, meaning you level twice as slow, so why not play an iksar?<P>Another point I believe you have missed is that humans have a higher damage output at 50-60 than iskars, to partially make up for lack of defence in lower levels.  <P>I play a 40s monk, and a 50s druid.

</FONT><HR>I have heard since I started this game, that monks are to be the masters of melee damage. We also know that's not true. <P>I feel we should have a superior ability to deal melee damage over warriors, because warriors serve the best ability at providing defense to a group. They have the highest taunt, the highest AC, and should (if they dont) have the highest defensive abilities.<P>I feel we should have a superior ability to deal damage over rogues. When the game was in its infancy, rogues were thought to be the typical 'thief' that would be able to use his abilities to aid a group or guild. When this wasnt realized in the release, the developers of the game suplemented the rogues abilities with much more combat ability. Now, with the introduction of SoV and Kunark, rogues to play their originally intended role.<P>Monks have received little to no enhancements to their damage dealing abilities. There was a inherent haste for Hand to Hand, and weapons implemented. We have always had in supplement to our damage dealing the ability to pull more efficently than any other class. As mentioned in this thread, that ability has faded with addition of content.<P>We now stand behind Rogues and Warriors in Damage. I feel we should be visibly ahead of either of them, as originally intended. I dont care if it is with weapons or equipment, or with abilities and skills; as long as I can do the job I created my character to do.<P>I do not feel we should be bashing and stunning, thus providing a service to the group that someone else is required to do. Defensive skills are another class's job, we dont need improvments . I dont care how much of a master you are in martial arts, a master warrior in near-artifact quality ancient armor is gonna defend BETTER. I want to deal the damage. There are LOTS of areas where damage dealing could be improved.<P>I dont think verant understands the vast difference in damage dealing between a rogue and monk at all levels either. I started on Vazalle when it went up. I started a monk, my friend started a rogue - it was a virgin server, but in two weeks, before we reached 20th level, the rogue aquired a Dragoon Dirk, and could vastly outdamage me. By 25 he received a Fang from SoV and the damage difference increased again, I have one fighting baton now, but he can still outpace me at 30. The situation will never improve, he will always be about 5 levels above me in damage dealing ability. I do not think this was intended.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The question here is, are monks supposed to do more damage than warriors and less than rogues. I don't know, really.<P>Yes, check the "Vision."  At least's that's what has been stated time and time again.  Monks are the masters of toe to toe damage per the "Vision."<P>"Hmm… Something that would be super defensive, prevent the monk from doing any damage, and allow him to back out (perhaps dropping them lower on the hate list). Oddly, that sounds like what feign death was supposed to do… "<P>Well it did until they changed the AI on the mobs that made FD useless.  This code is present in the LDC's in SolB, in certain Kunark mobs most noticeably the skels in Karnor's and in virtually all the SoV mobs.  FD has been nerfed to uselessness in SoV through changes in mob AI.  The hole as well.  Not exactly right to completely remove a class defining ability's effectiveness.<P>I'm not looking for major enhancements but more to gain back what we've already lost.  I'm also noticing a lot of warrior weapons out there that are now equal to monk weapons.  I don't mind that so much as that there are no monk drops being introduced to maintainthe status quo.<P>And one last thing... Our Appearance!<P>I know it's been said before but it just can't be said enough.  Our high level armors should not have the same graphics as our newbie gear. One item in particular... Azure sleeves.  99% of monks use this item for arm gear and usually obtain in their 30's and wear it for the rest of their lives as there's just nothing better nor does there appear to be something better ever to be released.  That's fine and all... but please, at least give the sleeves a graphic.<P>Also on the issue of graphics... iksar monk feet.  There are only 2 pieces of suitable armor that give a graphic for the feet.  Those being iksar hide boots and jboots.  No other monk gear gives a boot graphic.  Shiverback... nada... silvermoon... nada... crescent... nada... On both iksars and human monks, there's a lot of good textures that just never get used.<P><BR> <BR>  <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<BR>I have only played my iksar monk up through level 36 at this time, but I have been pleased with the monk up to this level except on one point which is damage dealing. I'm not going to say anything more on this, because I know the subject has be talked about many times. I just wanted to put up another post supporting more damage for monks so that it would have a better chance of being taken seriously. The second point has only come up in the last couple of levels. It has to do with Feign Death and the 'nerf' that has shown it's ugly head when I have attempted to pull level 32+ mobs. My normal method of 'FD pulling' has been made useless. From what I have heard from many monks and monk forums the 'Monk' has two main tasks #1. Damage #2.Pulling. With this FD 'nerf' I am no longer useful as a 'puller', I run up and hit something, then run back to my group because I have no way to split up a spawn. I also believe that a FD pulling gives a Monk player something to practice, something that takes some skill and effort to be good at. I think it would give people a goal to strive for to be a master of FD pulling. Personally I think this is one of the worst things Verant could have done to a monk. <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/eek.gif"> I think the 'level 32+ mob reagro' idea should be removed.<P>Clawe level 36th <BR>Iksar Monk<BR>Luclin Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello there,<P>ok, first i wanted to agree with qwai. Human Monks do a bit more dmg then iksar monk and iksar monks have a bit more natural ac then human monks. After both obtained the Celestial Fists they do the same dmg but the iksar has still the ac boost. plz look into that. then i wanted to say that i am kinda happy with my monk as he is atm. i dont see much that has to get balanced. but there are 3 things that realy realy suck:<P>1. It sucks to see items sold for 200pp that are actualy better then my plane armor. Shiverback is completely useless for high lvl monks. The key for a monk is his AC and the shiverback armor is a sliver better then cloth. So if u dont want to add AC to that armor, then plz make our natural ac a bit better. Example: Azure Sleeves 12 AC 0,1 weight or so, Shiverback 5 AC also 0,1 weight or so.<P>2. I thought we are the masters of hand to hand fight. So we as monks should realy be able to fight longer without losing our breath. If i am in a good balanced group and got a high enchanter speed buff, i need invigor after every second mob. Well a warrior in his BIG armor and his BIG weapons should lose his breath after a big battle, but a monk ? we all carry the weightless armor in the game, we are natural fighters with big inner power. we shouldnt need invigor as much as warriors or SK s or pallys.<P>3. I just wanted to say something about ur post: "i am not sure if monks should do more dmg then warriors". Uhmmm u personlay said " monks are dmg dealer and not dmg taker like warriors". I totaly agree, but then why shouldnt we do more dmg as a warrior ? they are tanks, so dmg taker, we are dmg dealer, they have taunt to get the dmg on em, we dont. we should do more dmg and u know that, sorry absor. U said that so many times before urselve i cant even remeber how often. Also u had a test fight with a human warrior and a human monk, to find out if monks do more dmg like it should be, can u remeber ? so i think monks should do more dmg then warriors and i think u know that too  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>But these 3 points i am very happy with my monk and its a big fun to play him, good work so far and i hope u will make him a bit more fun.<P>Noogard<BR>56 Human Monk<BR>Rathe Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Allow the cellestial fist effect to stack with other standard haste buffs, or make the haste effect permanent like<BR>                          that of rogues and rangers.<P>                          3. Thunderkick discipline should at the very least be on par with the double damage back stab ability of rogues. Not<BR>                          necessarily do as much, but atleast have a higher minimum base damage, double normal damage, and/or an<BR>                          associated proc.<P>                          4. Additionally, fly kick should double attack as per the rogue ability to double backstab.<P>                          5. All of our special attacks, or atleast some of them, should be able to use more than one per recycle time. To be<BR>                          able to round kick and fly kick at the same attack round would not noticably increase our damage output but would<BR>                          instill a little meaning in having those skills.<P>                          6. While I would not ask for monk items with rediculous damage delay ratios, I would say to slow down on the<BR>                          warrior and rogue stuff. If you are to introduce new items for monks I would only ask that they follow the same<BR>                          progression as any other class. Equal percentage increase in AC and equivalent increases in damage/delay to keep<BR>                          them above that of warrior/rogue.<P><BR>As a footnote to my suggestions, the reasons they all appear to "add" something to the class is because it is the better alternative to nerfing other classes and adjusting weapons with damage/delay ratios that are better than fists.<P>Argueably, it baffles me why some of these things weren't included originally when introduced, but I guess that's another debate.  An example would be the triple attack:  It's given to the necro monk pet and warriors, but not the monk class itself.  I would love to hear the reasons why.<P>While I would never say the monk class is useless, I would say that it is unfair to take away one of the main aspects of the class and literally give it to other classes, and that is the toe-to-toe damage output potential.  <P>With the increasing difficulty of monsters with each new expansion, in all honesty I doubt any serious imbalances would occur if some or all of my suggestions were used.  <P>What would happen is every one who plays the class will feel a little better knowing that they still have what they worked so hard to attain.  It's important to establish and maintain each class within the realm that they were designed and told they would dominate in so no one feels robbed or resentful.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, in amongst all the fluff this will probably never get read, but hey, you never know  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> (THROWING crits ffs?  where are these people from!).<P>I am going to make a few statements as I see the vision for the monk class's role in everquest, which you may disagree with perhaps,  and show the problems that this creates between the melee classes.<P>1) Rogues are intended to be the incarnation of damage.  No-one should do as much damage as a rogue who can backstab) in the high endgame, and thus require evade so they can do this.<P>2) Warriors are intended to be THE toughest toe-to toe opponents.  This is further exacerbated by /disc defensive at 55, which leaves them as the ONLY ones able to tank large scale encounters which were balanced against warriors max buffed using /disc defensive in the first place.  Hybrids don't like this, but its not per-se a problem as the intention is for hybrids to do less damage than warriors anyway in pure melee, though hybrids have many other issues.<P>3) Monks.  Now, with low HP and no taunt, but moderate ac and good defensive skills, monks are not tanks, cheal efficiency dictates this.  The way they are setup is to be more damaging than the warrior but less than the rogue (I think this is the case and should be the case.)  HOWEVER, with high end warrior weapons and the fact that basically their special attack decreases in significance dramatically in levels past 30 as an overall damage contributor, this is not necessarily the case.  The problem is that in high end encounters Monks have no genuine way to remove agro from themselves *or* survive (well, unless you count an *8 sec* survival duration 72 minute reuse discipline  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">).<P>The points about special attacks and min damages on FK/TK, combo strikes or offhand bouses is valid,  I think and this is the REAL source (apart from the skill cap convergence at 50+).  As as an overall percentage of your damage output FK is at a guess twice (if not more) as significant at L30 as it is at L50. (ie: FK is dominated by its magic number (58) and its minimum (3!) at all levels.  Unlike backstab, which is the tool through which rogue's damage superiority is achieved,  it does not scale with weapon damage or *anything*, and thus as main autoattack damage output goes up its significance overall deteriorates fast).<P>The weapon dependence of monks is something that is not liked, but somewhat inevitable in expansions since the grass has to be lusher to get the sheep to cross the river (or at least look it :P).  Doesn't really fit, but alas that's too late.<P>This is what I believes motivates alot of the suggested changes in the more thoughtful posts, and is NOT a class envy post (even though I mention monks and warriors), but determining where monks fit into the game. (The designers ideas about roles and players are not necessarily the same.  ie: I play a L52 shaman too,  and I can tell you catagorically his PRIME role is debuffing, and buffs are nice but secondary.)<P>Now.  The question is do you agree with this vision of the role of the monk in the game, and the rationale as to where monks fall away from this in the higher levels (which is the source of most of these requests)?<P>Yours,<P><BR>Lythe<P>Disciple of the Swifttails of Cabilis<P>ps: and yes, I know everyone's a customer, but throwing crits?  Pulease!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My comments:<P>1.  It's my understanding that most players are not supposed to be able to get the epic.  Therefore the epic cannot be figured in for balancing.  If monk (or any class) isn't balanced without their epic they aren't balanced.<P>2.  Before making recommendations PLEASE find out what the class is supposed to do.  Perhaps you could bring in another Verant employee who is more familiar with monks to help you.  But please don't start judging input from a position of ignorance.  There's no shame in not being expert in all the classes -- that would be virtually impossible.  There is shame in not getting help when you need it.<P>3. I liked an earlier response about FD so I'll summarize it again.  Please decide what FD is do and then do any adjustments to make sure it does that.  If FD is to be used for FD pulling then adjust it to so it works fairly reliably for that in the hands of a reasonably skilled player if their skill level is high enough.  If FD is to be used to kill aggro in the middle of a fight then the same goes for that.  But whatever FD is supposed to be for, please adjust it so that in the hands of a reasonably skilled player with a high FD skill level it can indeed be used for that fairly reliably.<P>4.  This relates to number (2) above.  It's always been my understanding that monks should do more damage then warriors but less then rogues.  They compensate for their higher damage with lower defense -- monks can't tank like a warrior.  If, in the end game, they do the same damage as warriors, they should be able to tank as well as warriors.  I personally think that isn't the best way to do it because I prefer the classes to be more distinct but that's just my preference.  If monks do more damage it really isn't critical HOW they do more damage (whether by triple attack, multiple secondary attacks, enhanced fist damage, whatever), although I personally think they should not be overly reliant on gear.<P>5.  While the end game is important, please remember that it isn't everything.  All levels need to be considered.<P>Please ignore the comments by some people on the human vs Iksar debate.  I myself was tempted to make some responses to those comments but decided this wasn't the place.  Lets save that discussion for another time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Two things.<P>Yes shiverback is crap. Please upgrade it to a point were it is actually better then other easily obtainable items.<P> The monk epic. I dont fill the quest is to easy. It too me months to compleete it. The quest begins when you are very low lvl and it give you something to work on as you lvl and a great goal.Overall i fill its one of the best quests in the game. It is allso obtainable by everone. The fact that it doesnt need a god drop or somthing is awesome. The Celestial Fists are not that great anyway. They dont make a monk overpowering and are barely better then 2 jade maces. Other epics like cleric and enchanter grant awesome poer to entire guilds. Thoose are the type of quest that should be harder and maybe require a god drop.<P><BR>The monk epic need to be improved it is barly better then jade maces. The song needs to be able to stack with enchanter haste. Maybe up the damage on them to 12 damage 16 delay that would make them at least on par with some of the weapons that warriors have.<P>Im on the fence about the Rolc droping on the brothers. I did th equest the hard way and was glad i did. But now im 54 and have my epic. Do i really want to go back and do a mid level quest ? no. Do i want to go gank brother Z? no . Do i want a nice robe to drop in fear thats as good as the rotlc only better looking&gt;?

</FONT><HR>Verant says: "Monks are the master in damage dealings, rogues are second and warriors are third in the case of damage dealings."<BR>Facts are: The monk get outdamaged by warrior, rogue and in some degree rangers.<P>Verant is only right if the server is a fresh one without characters from other servers.<P>Monks give up several stuff for gain several abilities:<P>They give up: weapon selection (no slashing and no piercing), Wearing stuff ability (Weight penalty going on AC), Selection of items (lot of stuff are not available to monk at all and another lot of stuff have the MONK tag but are still not usable well for monks because of the weight restrictions.) and the remaining items are very hard and difficult to obtain. Most monks (if they are not twinked) are wearing player maded stuff till higher levels! Lower hitpoints than a warrior. (They are about the same level as a rogue.) Lower AC than a warrior. No critical attacks. No crippling blows.<P>Monks gain the following abilities: Feign Death (FD), Instill Doubt (ID), Mending and the several kick and punch attacks.<P>From all special skills a monk receive only ID needs no rework. All other needs some rework. (see below).<P>Now the stuff I would like to see to being changed:<P>EQUIPMENT: More and easier obtainable equipment.<P>FEIGN DEATH: As it is considered an escape skill, it should be changed this way: FD should only work if the monk is below 40% of his full health.<BR>But then ths skill should work like the old way (full clearing the aggro after the mob returns to its spawnpoint).<P>MENDING: After Mending is reaching skill value 101 it does not improve its power after that.<BR>It is a fixed percentage that the Mend heals independly of how good your mend skill value is.<BR>My idea is to improve the percentage of heal by 1% per 10 skill points over 100. (A mend with 200 will heal 35% per use.)<P>KICK: Stays at is.<P>ROUND KICK: AOE kick that damages all mobs around the player. The damage is a bit smaller as the one from a kick.<P>TIGER CLAW: Stays as is.<P>EAGLE CLAW: A bit lower damage than Tiger Claw but with AC debuff on target.<P>DRAGON PUNCH: A bit lower damage than Tiger Claw with stun and pull back.<P>TAIL RAKE: Lower damage than DRAGON PUNCH but damages all mobs around the player.<P>FLYING KICK: Stays as is except that the minimal damage must be increased by a significant lvl.<BR>(It is insane that the rogue lvl 10 skill Backstab does more damage at minimum as a monk does with his lvl 30 skill at maximum!)<P>H2H: Increase the damage between lvl 50 and 60.<P>A monk using 1hb in each hand can possible outdamage a warrior using the same weapons by a very small amount, while a monk using 2hb will NEVER outdamage a warrior with the same weapon.<BR>Because the improved Dual Wield will not work if using 2hb. <P>Another issue are monks vs. spell casters:<BR>A monk goes down much faster than a warrior against spellcasters because: a) no improved magic resistance, b) no stun attack and c) lesser HP than a warrior.<P>Other players wrote already in the case about the fist damages.<P>Now an idea how to improve monk without making them to strong:<P>THE HINDRANCES: stays as they are except weight penalty: (lvl/4)+10. Ex: a lvl 60 monk can wear 25 weight without being affected by the weight penalty while a lvl 4 can only wear 11 weight without being affacted.<P>THE BENEFITS: Feign Death in the reworked version as above. Mending in the reworked version as aboved. Instill Doubt stays the same way as today. Kick, Round Kick, Eagle Strike, Tiger Claw, Dragon Punch, Tailrake and Flying Kick are removed and get replaced by these 2 skills:<P>MARTIAL KICK: Works more like the BACKSTAB but is using the feets and has no back attack restriction. (Minimal dam = LVL; Maximal Dam = LVL*4) Available at lvl 10. Cap at 200 at lvl 50; 250 at lvl 60.<P>MARTIAL STRIKE: Works somewhat like MARTIAL KICK but it is using the fists. Its damage is lower than the Martial Kick (Min Dam. LVL/2; max Dam = LVL*2)  but it can deliver a stun. Available at lvl 20. Cap at 200 at lvl 50; 250 at lvl 60<P>These 2 attacks works cumulative and not like the old kicks one at a time. That is you can use the 2 attacks at the same time. The maximum damage<BR>with the 2 skills at once is 360. That is about the max. damage from a Flying Kick of a lvl 60 monk.<P>Additional powers at lvl 30: Evade<BR>Because of the damage output the monk will aggro the mob on him. With Evade he can lower the aggro.<P>Additional power at lvl 40: gains the ability to do critical hits but not crippling blows<P>Modified power: Monks get improved Melee damage bonus: (LVL-10)/? instead of the (LVL-25)/? on the primary hand attacks. (This will result in about 5 to 8 damage more than a warrior of the same level)  With this will the monk fits more in his role of being the master of damage dealing.<P>Do not forget that the hindrances still exists.<P>Yours Elfenfeuer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, I'm somewhat concerned at some of the "fluff" ideas that made your list.  I am not saying that the ideas posted here by the many are not worthy of attention.  Hoever, I will stress, as many others have, that the Zadkiel/Bodi/Kaiele post is a compilation of the ideas of many, many monks on the main monk forum that has been discussed, refined and boiled down to the basics.  Lots of monks feel that these are the issues that should be addressed to balance the monk as a class with respect to other classes.  <P>There are some good ideas posted here that aren't listed in the ZBK post, but there are some definite red herrings:<P>- Throwing Criticals.  Ouch.  Our skill caps at 113.  Throwing is used as a pulling mechanism almost exclusively - the damage done is completely irrelevant.  I personally stopped using thrown weapons almost entirely about 10 levels ago in favour of aggro pulling (get close enough to the mob so that it aggros without doing damage to it)<P>- Triple attack.  UNLESS this were to be implemented as a skill with a high skill cap (230-252), and double attack were to apply as well (i.e. possible 6 attacks per round,) this would be a parlour trick and have no impact on balance whatsoever.<P>- Aggro reducing discipline.  Umm, we already get the Sneak skill.  Not perfect, but it sure does work.<P>- Tumble.  Huh?  Just raise the dodge/block/riposte caps to 252.  Maybe add parry to the monkly skill repertoire at level 51 or so.<P>Those are the ones that spring immediately to mind anyway.  I think there are several ideas that may make it through that have little bearing on balancing the monk class vs. other classes (Treant fists, woven armour not in Kunark, sashes/headbands, etc, etc.)  While these are laudable things that should be looked into, they are not things that will make a monk have a compelling reason to be chosen over a warrior.  They don't really belong in this particular discussion.<P>Try to stay on target.<P>Tilric<BR>50 Monkey<BR>Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor Wrote:<BR>&gt;The question here is, are monks supposed to do more damage than warriors and less than rogues. I don't know, really.<P>While I appreciate the candor, I do think it's fairly poor form to start a discussion about a class w/o doing a minimal amount of prior research.  Honestly, how can you decide what issues are valid to bring to tuning meanings w/o knowing the basic vision of the class?<P>&gt; Interesting idea. This can also be used to increase monks damage a bit. That it, IF it needs to be increased. But if anyone is going to be the master of throwing, it may as well be monks.<P>Throwing is already the rogue's arena.  And throwing would increase monk damage 'a bit' as much as a 60th wizard using a level 4 spell would increase his damage.<P>&gt; When compared to a warrior, a monk will either be more offensive and less defensive, or the other way around. Being better at both isn't balanced.<P>This is actually the essence of problems with warriors, at some point in the past one person thought warriors should be huge AC/HP damage takers, while another envisioned warriors as high damage dealing armsmen.  So the end result we get in EQ is a warrior actually being a hybrid of high damage absorbtion & high damage output.<P>When compared to a warrior, a monk should be doing a much higher damage output.  As for defense, monks shouldn't be huge AC/HP tanks, what they should be is high damage avoiders (via Dodge, Block, Riposte).  When a monk does get hit, it should (and does) hurt.<P>&gt; Maybe… it also sounds like it has a very high potential chance of bringing that damage output well above rogues… And having to go back and look over every monk-usable weapon list to make sure one of them isn't broken because of a change like this, well, that puts this idea very low on the list.<P>Not even close to over rogues.  Running some combos via copelands (which while not 100% accurate at least gives a pretty good feel):<P>60th Rogue - Ragebringer + Neb's Warbone =  5177 Damage Per Minute (w/ Backstabs)<BR>60th Rogue - Ragebringer + Neb's Warbone = 2605 DPM (w/o Backstabs)<BR>60th Monk - 2 Celestial Fists = 2451 DPM<BR>60th War - WillSapper + Blade of Strategy = 2443 DPM<P>60th Monk - 2 Celestial Fists w/ Offhand Bonus = 3478 DPM<P>MoorGhost stated:<BR>&gt;"8) Epic quest is too easy. This may not be a popular opinion, but it is true. The Robe of the Lost Circle is obtainable by killing the quest NPC's (please change this).<P>It's an option to an extremely boring, unecesary long camp.  Options are "Good Things" (tm).  A monk has the option of doing a 20+ hr camp alone, or round up a few groups of friend & fight a Quad hitting 350+ monster.<P>&gt; The Robe of the Whistling Fists can be multi-quested. Once the last robe is obtained,<P>Almost every other epic has multi-quest portions as well, I believe the enchanter quest is the only one that is VERY protected from multiquesting.<P>&gt; Once the last robe is obtained, three groups can do all four of the battles needed to get the fists<P>3 groups can do almost every other epic fight as well with some exceptions (sev, chardok Queen, trak)<P>Absor wrote:<BR>&gt;Keep in mind, though, those of you that are asking for some bonus for being a human monk. You already have a huge bonus. You do not pay an experience penalty for your race. That's even more important now that the burden for that penalty is on the individual character, not that group.<P>Ahh the race discussion.  When comparing Iksar & Humans monks, the best comparisson is with trolls & humans.  As trolls get the same benefits & penalties & pay the same xp penalty.  The only problem with Iksar & Human monks lies with the Celestial Fists.  A balance point for the AC bonus for Iksar Monks is the different H2H delays (Humans at 60 get 14/26 fists; Iksar have 14/24) - Celestial fists void this balance, they make both races have 9/16 fists.  The H2H delay balance should be carried over to the fists, giving humans 9/15 fists with Celestial fists mirrors the ratio of the barehanded numbers.  (As for the above chart with DPM's - Humans with an offhand bonus would be doing 3710 DPM vs Iksar 3478, not a huge difference but enough to balance back the 40AC)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The monk class is far from balanced from my view point. And is one of the few classes that are in need of balancing at all levels, not just post-50.<P>As stated in many threads, the issues of dealing damage and surviving damage are in need of some tuning. I beg to differ on the point of being allowed one or the other but not both. Monks should always be able to dish out slightly more overall damage then a warrior of a comparable level and gear, and at the same time must have a defensive value that is slightly less effective then wearing full heavy armor. That is what equates a monk and a warrior as equals on the battlefield.<P>Warriors are tanks. They have the AC to survive being hit, and the hit points to endure this for a given length of time. It is their job to taunt and take the damage for the group, and that's it.<P>Monks, like rogues, are not tanks. We are more like special forces then shock troops.<P>The only way a monk survives is through their defensive skills i.e. not being hit in the first place. Monks have a large aggro factor, in fact one of the largest for any melee class. When hit, sure we should rightfully take more damage because we have less physical AC. But we should be rarely hit, because we are much more mobile then even a rogue. That is the whole point of martial arts in the first place: avoidance of damage by any means necessary, including the ability to strike fast, hard, and lethally.<P>However, there is one thing that has got to be changed. Feign death must continue to be a viable group skill post-32 for pulling, else monks have no place, no niche, and no reason to be on any raid ever. Without feign death, the monk is a mana waster for clerics that should only need to concentrate on healing the primary tank.<P>The only single reason monks were ever invited on dragon and plane raids was to feign pull. That's all we had, and that's all we will ever have. Breaking spawns is the monks role in a group. I'm not saying we should be able to walk through any place without fear, due to some over-powered ability. Just that Verant should accept this as a smart tactic for players, and then plan on its use.<P>Causing the enemy forces to break off from one another in order to manage the fight to one's advantage, has always been, and shall always be one of the smartest strategic uses of force that can be devised. It is the mainstay for "Guerilla Warfare", in other words, when fighting an enemy that is larger, stronger, or better equipped then oneself. Feign death pulling can be seen as diversionary tactics, one of the first things any tactician learns. Fight smart, and one will always win over brute force.<P>I didn't create my monk to be some delusional warrior that doesn't believe in armor. I created him to be a puller. My very first EQ character was a Monk. I have been playing a monk a very long time, before most people even knew there was feign pulling. And pulling has always been the key reason to staying with this class.<P>Melee is not ever about standing toe to toe with something. That is moronic. Melee is a fluid motion, always moving always changing. This is why the warrior class appeals less to me then the monk. I still want to be in the fray, but I desire to have more then just "auto-attack on."<P>Monks do pay for all these things already. We simply do not have the hp base to survive any hard hitting or lengthy encounter. Not even with mend.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ok.. let me ask the monk community this..<P>I was having a discussion with someone and this got brought up.. and i had a flashback of when i started my character.. and this disturbs me..<P>When i started my monk last january i looked into what verant's "vision" was for monks.. so I want to tell you all what i remember of that vision:<P>Monks have a weight limit.. this was to keep them balanced.  What the weight limit balanced out was the fact that we didnt purchase gear.  We were born with fists.. that was our weapon.. it was free.. we were supposed to be able to do the most with armor that noone else wanted at higher levels.. which made it cheap, therefore we didnt need cash for that either.. the vision was we were supposed to out-do other melee with crappy items and no weapons.. -- This is what I saw as the "vision" for monks<P>now this is what happened.. when kunark came out I got completely frustrated with the class.. we went from being good with nothing.. to having to scrape up every little bit of cash we could carry so we could stay up to par with the twinks..  since the twinks were funded by people who could afford the fighting batons and the trance sticks and the knuckle dusters and the fungi tunics and the staves of shielding and all those other neat, droppable, sellable, very very expensive items that came out for monks.  So at level 30 all these other monks that people started are blazing through their lower levels cause they had these fighting baton things.. or a knuckle duster.. and were doing more damge than i EVER did with my fists.. the same fists i thought were supposed to be my only weapon.. so i worked HARD to get me 2 fighting batons.. i couldnt afford them so i had to go down to dalnir and camp them.. and i got crescent armor while i was there.  well great.. i had this class defining item that was expensive at the time so my damage could be up to par with the twinks.. but i lost months of playing trying to get these nice things because, as a monk, i couldnt afford to buy them.. so i hit 35 and all my friends have passed me up.. at this point all the 10-30 twinks had trance sticks.. "uhg" i thought and went to CoM to get this new class-defining weapon.. then i had to get a knuckle duster to keep up with the richer monks or monks with funding.. and the "vision" was completely lost.. <P>I had gone from being this guy that shunned hard-to-get armor and weapons because i could be better without.. to someone who had to camp and fight and spend loads of money and make deals so i could keep up with the damage that the rich monks, and the twink monks were doing.. so now im 51.. im still poor and have no alternates higher than me.. im thinking of getting my 30 necro up to 50 so i can farm cash to get one of these 2 handers that are now defining my class for damage..  this is insane.. verant has forgotten this "vision" that they fought so hard to defend and made a new "vision" for monks.. now we're the masters of gear.. we've gone from not needing weapons and gear to be the best.. to having the best weapons and gear.. <P>now i dont know if verant can fix the damage they've done.. i wish to god they would tho.. they've ruined the monk class.. at this point all we had going for us was our pulling.. and this was the only way we could get into groups.. verant forgot what their "vision" was for monks.. they only remembered pieces and parts of it.. they remembered that monks werent supposed to feign pull... so they kept fighting on that front.. but they forgot monks werent supposed to be required to have the best gear to be the best monk.. <P>I cant believe your all asking for better weapons.. or having our 1hb upped.. all the 50+ crowd is so used to weapons now that they dont remember what it was like to grow up thinking that we're better than needing weapons..  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>here is a little information you can take to your TESTING team about the evolution of classes from the ORIGINAL EQ to KUNARK to VELIOUS:<P>ORIGINAL EQ<BR>-lvl 50 was the max cap for all classes<BR>-monk skills in offense and defense and duel wield were MUCH higher than warriors<BR>-monk fists 14dmg 30dly compared to the best weapon ingame the Ykesha sword 8dmg 24dly (75dd proc)... this shows the ORIGINAL damage spread between monk and warrior... showing how much more Verant actually thought a monk should do<P>KUNARK<BR>-max level raised to 60<BR>-warrior and rogue skill caps in offense, defense, weaponskill, dual attack, dual wield... all within a few points of a monk... basically the skill difference becomes negligable<BR>-all melee classes got super-armor, spell casting abilities on them, superior armor class boost<BR>-warriors got huge hit point increase and magic resistant increases<BR>-rogues get the ability to double-backstab with minimum level based damage... thus increasing their damage output 100% over any other melee as long as they stay behind a monster<BR>-9dmg 18dly weapons become common... lvl 30 people can buy them now... this has drastically increased the average damage output of all melee classes... therefore the monk class (originally supposed to be the best melee) needs to be rebalanced to compete with 9dmg 18dly<P>VELIOUS<BR>-weapons usable by all classes with 13dmg 20dly only serves to raise the bar even higher for average damage output for all melee<BR>-while 13dmg 20dly weapons are not common yet... they will be in 6 months...<P>please consider all these factors when you rebalance monk damage, the high end warrior damage... the SUPER-high end rogue damage from behind (please have someone test this i cannot believe no one at VERANT knows how much damage a lvl 60 rogue with Ragebringer can do??)<P>and keep in mind the original VISION:<P>monk 14dmg 30dly fists<BR>vs.<BR>ykesha 8dmg 24dly sword<P>this balance needs to be maintained</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hail My Brothers and Sisters<P>I have been lurking and thinking on the subject of finding the yin/yang of our class. Props to all of the folks who have posted lots of great ideas. I think that what Verant really wants to provide us (monks but all players in general) with are choices. Choices that we make, that effect which niche we fulfill. The basic reasoning is that if the decision making is placed in our hands then more issues become internal discussions within our community rather than rants directed towards Verant which promotes dissatisfaction with the game. <BR>So in that light, my suggestion is to allow players to select disciplines in which they can specialize. Specialization in a discipline could do various things either decrease the reuse time of the discipline or enhance the discipline itself or both. Each of the disciplines that we have:<P>Resistant<BR>Fearless<BR>StoneStance<BR>ThunderKick<BR>WhirlWind<BR>Voidance<BR>InnerFlame<BR>100Fist<BR>SilentFist<BR>AshenHand<P>Help to deal with the challenges that are presented to us. And, they help to define what momentary niche we fill. Specialization would be a individual reflection of what you want to be. Each of us has a different impression of what that niche is, which is why we have so many varying opinions as to what changes should be made to the class. I say let Verant set the limits, but we make the decision of what we become. What those enhancements to the disciplines should be, I shall leave to debate.<P>Deiel Monk of the 48th Knuckle <BR>Soldier of Fortune<BR>Xegony<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
