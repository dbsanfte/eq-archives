</FONT><HR>uhhhhhhm, i have already posted this before, but if you don't like "gems" , then don't type in the command, the sound still works while you are playing it so you can hera if anything starts to happening, and you still get the flying text "greater scalebone bashes group member x for 32 damage" etc., so i don't see how any reasonably responsible person could or would continue to play gems when they should be pulling/fighting/nuking/healing.<P>  we are all in there to play EQ, not gems, it is just a side bit to help make some med time go by a little easier.<P> if i wanted to really play another game, i wouldnt be logged in to eq, i'd go play it, but gems is nice to pass the meddin down time.<P> Also, i am NOT in favor of "group leader" having control over who can play and who can not, nor recieve any message as to who is playing.<P> that "group leader" is not my daddy,he ain't my boss, and its none of his business. he may be a warrior class who doesn't know how tedious medding can be over 35 levels, etc.<P> you trust me to do my job, and i'll trust you to do yours, til you show me different.<P> just because someone MAY have been the one to do the "invite" does NOT necessarily make them the highest level, most capable, player in that group, he just clicked the invite button.<P> if there is so much concern amongst some of you that people you Group with are going to abandon or ignore their primary responsability to the group to sit there and keep playing gems, you either need to seriously re-evaluate who you are are grouping with , or give them more credit than that.<P> Or, maybe THEY need to lose YOU , since you obviously have little or no regard for their abilities or confidence in their dedication to the Group.<P> I'd think real hard about the implications of any statements i made regarding gems, the fact remains, if you don't like it, don't play it, but don't be a nazi and start trying to force your opinion / preferences on others.<P> we're all in the game to have fun, and i see the "fun vampires" have gone to work already , trying to "suck the fun" right out of this, making a war out of a trivial addition to the game that harms no one.<P>            just my 2 coppers- <P>                naz  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>fun vampires?<P>I am trying to merely point out that for a grouping game, Verant sure isn't promoting that with this addition...<P>I also am in pickup groups alot, because I don't powerlevel or camp, and giving people more of a reason to solo (ie diversion) less people will group... <P>Pickup groups aren't always the most efficient groups, and sometimes they even meld together well.  To give the added "lure" of a mini-game while going ho-hum and the suspision of a player who were to end up dying because of a mistake, I think that this can only cause other problems...<P>Also the Gems game is more of a distraction than you realize, as was evidenced last night while I was playing the game and getting spammed (spam=lag) by people yelling scores... Like having to deal with Faymart and EC, but about some innane puzzle game?? If I don't wanna hear spam of three people discussing a sport I never heard of, I sure don't want this...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Naz,<P>This has nothing to do with me just having fun, it has to do with things spoiling my fun...<P>Last night, I entered the game for an hour, and my FUN was so destroyed by GEMS spam because I was lagged right out of the game.. I created a  newbie in a zone where there weren't any players spamming the zone with "Teris" scores, and this was the only way I could "have fun" last night... <P>I also don't want to see the "vision" completely abandoned, and would rather have had something that wasn't individual but group based for multiplayer.... In a game of multiplayer "role-playing", giving people something that ditracts from "immersiveness", rewards/encourages soloing, that can destroy the group dynamic, and cause more problems than benefits it just doesn't fit...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>What about the people who are using this as a way to "guard" spawnpoints, and who get kill stealed???<P>What about the fact that soloers will now have something to occupy themselves, so they can ignore the rest of players, as well as the multiplayer aspect of the game??<P>What about the annoying comparison of scores, and how this destroys the "fantasy" environment???<P>Grouping was only the straw that broke the camels back for me, and I KNOW that I will NEVER try gems not even for a second.... I play this game to interact with people and roleplay!! I hate needing to repeat myself because "I wasn't paying attention" and this game will not help...

</FONT><HR>I think your main problem is that you think people are sheep. I really dont think that anybody who solos over level 15 or so didn't already have something to do while they med. If im soloing, I usually watch tv or read a book. I didn't need verant to put in a command for me to realize that I was bored watching a little blue line get bigger, I had figured that out LONG before I even had everquest.<P>Will more people solo for a day or two because of this, mabey. Will it have any long lasting effect on the game, not really. I would much rather have my cleric playing gems when I needed a heal than playing his ps2.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Verant is always using their "vision" to explain balcancing and nerfing and this post is voicing my opposition to what this game represents to Everquest.... The grouping part was just something that occured to me before I had been able to play post-patch, and then I entered the game last night and saw the destruction myself... <P>Verant policing for names was supposed to be to retain the "environment" and GEMs in my opinion is even worse... </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>taobob:  Do you *read* what you post?  Does it read as being reasonable to you?  Here we are, 24 hours after they added a cute little mini-game, and you are griping about spam in zone-wide communications?  Worrying that you are going to die because someone in your group was playing gems?  Thinking that this is going to destroy player interaction?  Ouch.  I mean, wow.....<P>1)  In the first week or two after any change, there is going to be a LOT of talk about it and then it will die down.  I sincerely doubt that after two weeks you are going to see zone-wide spamming regarding gems.  As far as that goes, though, what's the big deal?  You're getting lagged about by zone talk about gems???  I've run around in EC during prime-time weekend hours with 30 players all auctioning constantly and not had a big problem, so how can you be getting this incredible lag from gems talk (and on a non-weekend??  Doubt it very much.  I was in The Overthere last night and rarely saw a word about it in /shout or /ooc....<P>2)  You are not going to die because someone was playing gems when they should have been paying attention to the battle.  You are going to die because someone wasn't paying attention during the battle, and the reason is irrelevant.  If my healer calls out AFK right after our puller has grabbed (and notified us about) a "big red," we're probably going to die, and we're probably going to have some choice words about it, whether it was then watching an engrossing television program for a few minutes, getting a soda or whatever.  The next time they do it, they're getting kicked cause I got no time for it.  The same would go for our wizard, our bard (maybe not the bard since at least one song would still be going  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ) or our tank.  If you're not willing to help the group out when we need it, then you are of NO use to us.  Again, gems doesn't enter into it.<P>3)  Is this going to end player interaction?  Not hardly.  Most of the people that I find in-game to group with and yak with would RATHER be fightin', then yakkin', and then playing gems or doing something else outside of EQ (usually resulting in them logging off).  Besides, as someone already stated, the game is not so complex that you can't have a conversation with people (we were doing it in guild chat last night, joking about sitting and playing gems while some of our guildmates were sitting in Guk waiting for a spawn) while you play.  Further, the idea that this is going to make soloing more attractive because people will be more willing to sit and heal up if they can play this baby Tetris clone is ridiculous.  They're paying $10 a month for Everquest, and I would submit that they would PROBABLY rather be playing Everquest.  If this were enough reason for them to solo, they would be soloing anyway and would have bought a Gameboy.<P>4)  The Vision (TM) thing.  There may be some validity to this.  However, the mechanics of the game on our end do not change the fact that board games and the like have been around for *centuries* and people WOULD play them in their leisure time.  It could easily be argued that, despite the mechanics WE see on the computer screen (you do realize that you are playing this on a computer and you are not ACTUALLY running around in the fantasy world of Norrath, right?), it could simply be the process of drawing a small colored gem from a bag and having to place it on a board in a certain pattern; yes, there are effects that the computer randomizes, but that could be simulated physically (in person, so to speak) with a roll of dice or self-imposed time limits on placing a piece.  As an adjunct to the refutement of this argument, how realistic is it that you have to use a mouse or cursor keys to move your head and body around in the game?  How realistic is it that you can be standing behind someone and still be attacking a creature with your sword?  Do these effects distract significantly from the immersiveness of the game?  No, they are necessary evils since this is, at best, a simulation.<P>In short, your arguments go nowhere fast.  I can respect the fact that you don't like the game or the fact that it was added in the first place.  However, your attempts to construct "reasonable" arguments against it fall short in a number of ways (several of which I have detailed above).  If someone gets you killed while playing gems, they would have gotten you killed elsewhere.  If one or two out of every six people in a zone decide to solo because it's more fun now that they have gems (not gonna happen), then you will simply be left creating groups from the remainder; perhaps pulling a little less if you are one or two members short of the maximum, but not dividing the experience among those people either.<P>Like it or don't.  It is, like the new binding points which so many are already complaining about, a pure addition to the game.  Nobody's class got nerfed with the addition of the game or the binding points.  Nobody lost any items with the additions.  In short, nobody gets hurt.  That would be MY opinion.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One other small thing:  If zone-wide messages about high scores in Gems are enough to take you out of the game, why are you reading them.  There is a filter, as others have stated.  Further, if you would like it to be TRULY immersive, you would turn of zone-wide communications, guild chat, etc. AND you would never send a /tell to anyone; all of these things are highly unrealistic and are indicators (no matter what is being discussed) that Norrath is not "real."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Babster,<P>I disagree with you on almost every point you make, mostly from the perspective that it shouldn't have been implemented in the first place .. <P>1) Yes maybe the zonewide spam may be temporary, but late nights when I play there are enough connection problems that it does cause problems. I also can do without people comparing scores, and even if that wasn't the reason I went LD I have no interest in "outscoring" others just like I don't compete for loot/levels...<P>2) You can not guarantee that I will not die due to anything, and I already leave groups when I realize that it is in my best interest to do so. The problem I have with Gems is that it "gives" players something to do other than their job, and unlike just watching TV or going AFK at the wrong time Verant is encouraging it. <P>3) The amount of soloing is something that needed to be reduced, and not increased. Verant had been encouraging grouping and by giving players something to do in "downtime" they (Verant) obviously feel that less people are in efficient groups and need something to do "to pass time"... Will more people solo because of this? I don't know, but it's the message that Verant is sending that I personally don't like.. I also think that the first few times people are camping spawns and get KS'd that this will cause major problems..<P>4) The "vision" and the role playing simulation is the reason I started playing this game, and I believed that Verant wanted to keep the RP atmosphere by enforcing the naming policy... I realize that imagination is required to actually put my character into a fictitous world, and that was the attraction for me... Having people with ill-fitting names wasn't bad enough for roleplaying, but now we have "high scores" too... Can it be said that this game "fits" into EQ? In my opinion NO, and when I meditate (in RL) I don't play Tetris in my head....<P>The filters aren't enough to remove what this does  to the fundementals of EQ, and were they to implement a mini-game they should have made something more fitting of the "vision"... <P>If I wanted to be in a chatroom, I'd be in a chat room....<P>If I wanted to play Tetris, I'd go to shockwave and play it...<P>If I want to play Everquest (or any Role Playing game), I go inside my imagination, and use the graphical interface that Verant gave me to breathe  life into my character.... Simply put this game was designed with Roleplay in mind, and not chat room plus Tetris...<P>Just because Verant made a game that is popular doesn't mean they (or I) should give up on the BASIS for what this game was... <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OMG you guys are dissing Gems?  Why?  I logged on and played it for 30 minutes yesterday just for the heck of it.  There is nothing wrong with adding a minigame to EQ.  If you're worried about getting killed with people playing Gems then write their name down and NEVER group with them again.  I'm a cleric and truthfully I could care less if I or anyone else dies.  It usually goes like this "Oh well, Rez, Rebuff, get more XP."  If what really matters to you is not dying, and forgetting to have fun then I DON'T want you in my group.  <P>People who sit around and gripe about loot, XP, and downtime are the people I don't group with.  I avoid those people like the plague.  So let me play gems.  If you don't like it I dare say you should never type /gems.  And if you don't like people who play Gems I wanna see everyone laugh at you when you do an /ooc with a message that goes something like this "XX Warrior LFG that doesn't play Gems."  I bet everyone and their dog will laugh at you; I know I would.<P>Verant DON'T Remove Gems so a few complaining people can feel a little better about themselves.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Taebob... get a grip.  So what if Abso said gems-related deaths won't be taken care of.  Anyone who dies playing gems, or lets a groupmate die while playing gems... doesn't need to be grouped with in the first place.<P>And if they weren't playing Gems, they'd be doing something else... AWAY from the monitor.  At least with Gems... it's keeping attention focused on the monitor.  I tested the mini-game out today... it was ok for when I was SOLOING.  Oh my... I said a dirty word.  Need to wash my mouth out with soap.<P>Some of us CANNOT group regularly or only play for an hour or so at a time when we can.  That means we HAVE to ABSOLUTELY solo to get anywhere.  I solo because, one, I like to.  Number two, becuase I don't always have time to group together. And three... becuase there are times wehre I just don't want to have to rely on someone else in the group to do their job.<P>And you talk about roleplaying as if it were the Holy Grail of EQ.  If you truly meant to roleplay, you would turn off all chat channels other than Say, would never use /tell's, and would also turn off al PC and NPC names.  You'd hide the target box and your health box as well.  YOu'd turn off anything and EVERYTHING that wasn't EQ Roleplaying related.  You'd never right-click and item for it's stats.  You'd never do anything that dealth with numbers....<P>That would be true, immersive roleplaying.<P>~Lleylia</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

But the word 'instead' in your comment is misleading.  The time required to create Gems… well, I'm proud to say that one of our programmers did it at home while he was sick for a few days.  That's dedication.  The time needed to make a working card game that would be triggered by some in-game activity and would be, essentially, multi-player and would allow in-game betting would be significantly greater.<P>You seem to have two other points.  One is that Gems might cause people to get their characters killed (or other characters killed), and that we shouldn't have put Gems in because of that.<P>Sorry, but it's no different than having you television on while playing.  If the player is going to get that wrapped up in Gems, then he should make sure that he's not going to be putting himself or others at risk while doing it.  Actually, it's better than watching television.  You can pause Gems…<P>Your second point is that Gems is harmful to the roleplaying aspect of the game.<P>It's not.  And if it was, I'd be the leader in the campaign to have it removed.<P>Again, it's just like watching television.  It has no effect on the roleplaying atmosphere of the game.  It is completely internal to the person playing.  I'm not harming the roleplaying atmosphere of my pen and paper games if I spend a few moments thinking about how poorly my stocks did that week.  It's completely internal and only affects other players if I let it affect the way that I play.<P>&gt;"Ummm, anyone see my point now that Absor has made an official statement proving my point to be valid??"&lt;<P>Actually, the only point that has been proven valid is that people are, for some incomprehensible reason, petitioning for help because of Gem related incidents.  This does not prove that such incidents are actually happening, and it certainly will not be taking up much time for our customer service people, since we are not helping people for Gem related deaths.<P>&gt;"Now if only Verant can reason away the destruction of immersiveness as well as Roleplaying, then I can die happy, hehehe "&lt;<P>No need to die at all.  But, well, Gems only affects the immersiveness of the game for those playing it.  If you don't play it, it won't effect you.  Those that are spamming about high scores, if they bother you /ignore them.  And I would imagine that you have your /ooc off as well as your /shout, because both of those can be considered destructive you the immersiveness of the game.  Nobody could possibly yell loud enough to be heard all the was across any Karana zone…<P>Sorry, but Gems does nothing to harm your ability to roleplay in EverQuest unless you choose to let it do so.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, <P>You said:<BR>"But, well, Gems only affects the immersiveness of the game for those playing it. If you don't play it, it won't effect you."<P>It already has affected me, because now I fully expect people who I meet/group with to want to compare "mini-game" scores even though I don't play it... My character does for the most part ignore /ooc and shout or disbale it most of the time, but the people I group with will still discuss it and play it...<P>"Sorry, but it's no different than having you television on while playing."<P>I don't have my television on while playing, and my problem with Gems is that it will be an in game distaction (prvided by Verant) that is individual based.. People who I group with could be playing this without my knowledge, and although people already DO conduct other activities while playing, those can increase risk what I don't like about this is Verant encouraging this... <P>I also think that this caters to "soloers" and also can certainly not help the "camping" problem. There also is the distinct possibility that this could cause further problems with "kill-stealing" because someone was trying to beat their high score waiting for Uberitemguy_00 to spawn...<P>"It has no effect on the roleplaying atmosphere of the game. It is completely internal to the person playing."<P>But, it is not internal to the person playing if people I could be grouped with might have it on...  Now, even though I will never turn it on, it will still affect me because it IS internal to the person playing. <P>Another poster had asked whether I would be shouting for groups asking for "non-gem playing people", and although I certainly wouldn't do that I might ask that people in my group not play this or discuss it while grouped (and be ridiculed by some because of it)... I am already ridiculed by half of the population for wanting to "roleplay" my character, so how exaclty does this preserve roleplaying??<P>"Actually, the only point that has been proven valid is that people are, for some incomprehensible reason, petitioning for help because of Gem related incidents. This does not prove that such incidents are actually happening, and it certainly will not be taking up much time for our customer service people, since we are not helping people for Gem related deaths."<P>I don't understand why people are complaining either because death is a part of the game, and some of it may be an attempt to get a "free ride". I know that I personally wouldn't appreciate dying because someone else was "gemming" (but it wouldn't upset me) but others I have been with do get upset. I have seen far too many arguements/bad blood because of deaths...<P>Right now the GMs are only getting people wanting assistance with Gem caused deaths, what happens when they are needed to moderate arguements???<P>"Sorry, but Gems does nothing to harm your ability to roleplay in EverQuest unless you choose to let it do so."<P>I choose to, and really it already has...<P><BR>      </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
