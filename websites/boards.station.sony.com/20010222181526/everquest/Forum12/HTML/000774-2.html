</FONT><HR>Originally posted in main forum, but it looks like this has moved here...<P>There doesn't seem to be any mention of our debuff lines (weaken & disempower). Its widely agreed that these spells have little effect on mobs, and are usually reserved only for PvP/duals. The reason they aren't effective in PvE is that mobs typically have no weight. One "trick" is to charm the mob, hand it several heavy items (blocks of ore) and then fight it and debuff. A very simple fix would to be to assign the mob a standard weight that it would have for its given AC & stats. Granted, I know mobs get an advantage, but assign them something other than zero. That way once we debuff them, it would have some effect. I know some mobs should have higher STR/AGI etc than others, a giant for instance these debuffs would be less usefull, but a caster type it should be a viable strategy. I'm definately not saying that this should be usefull in all situations, but I'm trying to offer a possible way to easily make these spells a bit more usefull and to bring them back from page 50 of my book. (I realize this may affect more than just enchanters, as there are a few classes that get similar spells.)<P>Also, please re-look at the taunt on Tash. You say that all debuffs have the same taunt factor, but that simply must be wrong. If I cast Tash, the mob will agro to me off the tank. Then if say a shaman casts several debuffs, the mob is still on me. If all debuffs were the same taunt, the mob should agro the shaman after the second debuff.<P>Also, I don't see an mention of the problems with ALL of our spells being magic based. Either give us some sort of alternate line (poison/disease), or some lure-like spells with very low resists. Also, change our spells to not all be ALL-or-Nothing spells. Partial resists might be a reasonable compromise (not just the direct damage, but debuffs as well, a partial resist might be 50% effective for instance).<P>Also, on the religion ideas, if some sort of mask religion spell is put in, and religion made "usefull" in some fashion, PLEASE make a quest to be able to convert to a religion. There was talk about that this is "impossible" why so? I mean, when the quest to convert is done you should be able to just add and subtract a set number of faction points with each faction sect that likes/doesn't like that religion. how is that "impossible" ? seems very straight forward.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This post doesn't address what I think is the biggest enchanter balance issue:  We die too much. Many have suggested better defensive skills; I don't think that's the way to go.  One of the following would be more consistent with enchanter abilities:<P>* Illusion: Corpse (i.e. feign death) -- this is a combination of two enchanter specialties (illusions and hate-list manipulation), which I think justifies the giving of a necro/sk/monk ability to enchanters<P>* Illusion: Gate (like the D&D spell Shadow Door) -- use the same particle effects/messages as the Gate spell, but have the effect of making the caster invisible and wiping the hate list (as with feign death).  This could be seen as less diluting than Illusion: Corpse, and the unreliable duration of invis balances it.<P>* A fast-casting spell that moves the enchanter further down on the hate list (as with rogues' evade or rangers' jolt).<P>----------------------------<BR>To address a few other points on your list:<P>* Failure Messages - Memory Blur also gives the same message on success and failure.  Blur doesn't get a normal resistance check; since you're being more open about game mechanics (as on the rogue evade skill), it would be nice to know a bit more about how this spell line works.  <P>* Better pet control - I don't care about /pet attack; the only pet command I want is /pet back off, so that I can keep a pet out for extra damage without worrying about it constantly breaking mez.  <BR>* Illusion races bug - there is a related graphical bug with elemental illusions: people who zone in after the illusion is cast see the wrong textures.<P>* Mesmerization spells - on a related point, the Hole operates under old-world rules (level 53+ creatures can't be mezzed), but it was added after Kunark and is designed with post-50 players in mind.  Some mobs there can't be mezzed due solely to this rule; there is no way to know besides trying it.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Why were the AC and Defence capabilities for enchanters not even put on the list?  I just looked back through the first 4 pages of the enchanter talk thread (part one) and saw it mentioned 12 times.  If that isn't a pattern to note a problem I don't know what is.  We get beat on more than *ANY* non-melee class and we have the fewest hit points and the worst armour and virtually no defence or offence capability.  I understand that people believe 'your a caster, why are you meleeing?', but the reality of it is, we don't usually have a choice.<P>Nill<BR>Tribunal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Let me clarify so there can be no mistake. The biggest issue for enchanters is that they only have magic based spells, and that the tash line does not debuff magic resistance enough at any level. This is not a Velious problem, but a core problem of the class.<P>The Velious problem is a completely separate design flaw.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think enchanters of different levels should be able to have their buff of the same spell stack.<P>For example, if a level 56 enchanter casts rune 5 on a tank, the tank gets beat up a bit (but rune is still on the tank) a level 54 enchanter should be able to cast rune 5 on the tank and have it overwrite the current rune 5, thus refreshing it.  Currently this cant be done.<P>For example, a level 56 enchater Mezzes a mob, the 56 enchanter or a higher level enchanter can refresh the mez, but a lower level enchanter cant, even though they use the same mez spell.<P>Another example, a cleric joins your group, but they had a higher level enchanter cast clarity2 on them.  You now cannot refresh their c2 untill the previous c2 wears off.  Very annoying.<P>It is very frustrating to be on a raid as an enchanter when you are not the highest level enchanter there, because your buffs wont hold on players (to refresh the buff) and you cannot refresh mez on mobs that a higher level mezed.  Players of any level should be able to refresh the buff when casting the same exact buff.<P>Also I think Augment (56) and Speed of Shissar (from epic) should stack with the SoV ranger buff (i forget the name, but it adds a bit of AC, but no speed), currently it doesnt.  Currently this ranger spell is an annoyance to the enchanter as speed wont hold on the ranger.  At the very least, id like to see the enchanter spell overwrite this ranger spell, but having it stack would help out the rangers (which need help).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Three very important points, that while talked about seem to miss the point<P>non controled pet's makes nearly 1/3 to 1/2 an enchanters spell list useless. The pet should either listen to /pet backoff  or a command only an enchanter has  called /pet stop  and have it work like mez'ing for 15 sec..<P>Next<BR>Since your so gung ho to take away some of our illusions..  then why are you letting Nerco's into our special ability and for that matter shaman , They can regen their mana at the expense of health turn right around and start casting life tap spells, which gives them much much less down time-- very very wrong.. not only do they somewhat get our ability but they get a bouns we can't touch, shorter down times!!!<P>Thirdly  the enchanters need to be moved lower on the agro list, this is just plain out of balance<BR>I died the other day to an ice bone skele, I was grouped I never hit that mob once,  no matter how hard my group bashed it, cast at it, it stayed on me until i died what is worse is that it's life left was so low you could not see it in the bar yet the game let it live until it took another 1/2 bubble of my life to kill me then it promptly died as soon as i did <P>Oh and one extra point, there's tons more but i will stop at this one, I believe that there should be special reasons for every class to be in a group, this is supposed to be a grouping game, D'OH, and taking those special reasons away just makes for less diverse grouping..<P><BR>Thanks<BR>A challenging task should have an equally rewarding ending... which sadly much of EQ is missing ( in my  opinion )</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Another note that doesn't seem to be addressed... Illusion: Iksar and the NPC's in Cabilis. As it is, and of the Shaman NPC's will be KoS to an enchanter with that spell up, and for no reason. It is a quest that clearly can't be accomplished without high level help when you can first get the spell (level 20), and the reward is minimal at best.<P>I also have one general thing that has bugged me for quite a while now... there is at least one mob in EQ that is IMMUNE to all magic, but there is nothing that is immune to melee damage. Now, enchanters are still somewhat useful against the anti-magic creature (for buffs), but if there is something immune to one side of the coin, there should be one with the opposite immunity.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Oh ya - DoT pet:<BR>  If there where add mobs to mez around epic mobs, 'chanters would be happy, I'd think.  Or, give us something creative, like mana dump/lure mana suck.  But, really, we have never done damage, and I personally like it that way.<P>  Also, the pet - giving it orders.  Most enchanters don't bother with the pet while grouping, only while soloing.  It gets in the way, attacking mobs we mez and all.  I would find /pet back off far more useful than any sort of /pet attack.<P>  Even pets that didn't attack mez'd mobs would be kick-ass.<P>  But, no enchanter in their right mind will cast a pet in a group where they are mezing.<P>  Then again, in SoV they ain't mezing, so...<P>  Extra pet attacks just serve to make enchanter guardians more like other classes pets.  I can do without that.  Just let me mez.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Things pretty hostile on this thread already  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> Understandable though in light of the ignorant screaming of 'enchanters are gods' that people who don't have the sense to actually take a look at the balance of things seem to find so essential. Enchanters aren't gods, we're specalists, and we happen to specialize in a field that verant made important to a group. We aren't the only ones that can do it, and we pay a heavy price of not being good for much else when we can't crowd control for our being the best at it. People see us putting mobs to sleep and forget about the fact that other classes all add a heap to a group as well in less obvious or spectacular ways. Apart from that you need to look at our overall value, yes.. in a group fighting multiples that aren't giant or high MR or high cons we're good.. put us elsewhere and we're mediocre, the tradeoff is fair. Basically what i'm saying here is for god's sake don't nerf us because of people hyping up our strength, take a look at things overall, take a look at how other classes add to groups just as much, and take a look at the fact that others can already crowd control to a point as well. I don't think we need much added.. all i'd ask for is for the overwriting to be fixed with single and AE mez, and for mem blurs to be looked at carefully.. Lower cast/recast maybe, make sure the checks are right and the exotic ones like amnesia work right, maybe make all mesmerize spells mem blur as well rather than just some of em and that's about it.. Lot of complaints about us dying, mem blurs can help stop that some.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt; Magic Resistances in Velious <P>I hope you will do something for that.<P>&gt; ITEM: DoT Pet.<P>I would have liked something more in line with the enchanter's capacities. It's always the same "dont blur the lines between classes" argument. You are repeating to us that we are not a pet class (and we are not !) and that we are not a damage dealer class (and we are not !) but you consider giving us another stupid pet to make some poor damage during the big raids ? Doesn't make much sense to me. I would really prefer during theses fights the role that necromancers dislike so much (but with a little addition) : we are the mind specialist, we should be able to steal the minds of a mob (mana tap) and then give it to the oh so necessary clerics !! We could then act like a mana relay. Mana manipulation is one of our core abilities. Note that I've not been yet in a big encounter like that and that my opinion is just here a little suggestion. <P>&gt; ITEM: Rampage.<BR>&gt; DESCRIPTION: This line does not stack with other strength buffs (shaman buffs in particular). Is this as it is intended to be?<P>With 100%MR mobs I could perhaps do *something*  with this spell (not necessary usefull but something) during the fights and not just buffing pre-fights. Presently it's impossible to use rampage due to the stacking problems (i'm not sure there are not stacking issues with other spells that strength spells btw).<P>&gt; ITEM: Illusion, Wolf.<BR>&gt; DESCRIPTION: There has been a call to have this spell grant Spirit of Wolf. If it gets no Spirit of Wolf component, then perhaps it could work indoors (it is currently outdoors only). It should be noted that Enchanters have no foot-speed enhancement spells at this time.<P>Spirit of the wolf for the enchanter class sounds to me like a bad idea. Sure I wouldn't say no, but it's not our class domain. HOWEVER I never understand why we were denied the right to cast this spell indoor. There is no reason. Illusions do not care about nature, outdoor or indoor considerations.<P>&gt;ITEM: Undead Illusions.<BR>&gt;DESCRIPTION: These transformations could be considered the territory of the necromancer, and maybe they should be replaced with something else, or remove them from the enchanter spell list.<P>Couldn't the charm spells be considered the territory of the enchanter class ? But...but... necromancers have charm undead and druids have charm animal !!! Necromancer can -charm- (like in: what a charming necromancer) undeads because they are specialist of the dead ? So I can illusion myself in a skeleton because I'm the master of the illusions. Am I not ? <BR>Honestly, i dont care too much about these illusions without faction modifiers if you were suggesting to trade them for new ones. But you know that you wont give us new ones. You have told us that in another long thread. I cannot accept that you take illusions out of us, when it's not a balance crucial issue and when you know you wont give us new illusions. Respect us please.<P>&gt;ITEM: Lull spells.<BR>&gt;DESCRIPTION: These spells seem to be resisted too easily, more often used to pull than to break up a group. It seems that there should be at least a fair chance that the creature resisting this spell will not immediately aggro.<P>At present, the entire lull line is simply not used by any enchanter out there. Looking at the statistical data made by fellow enchanter, I understood why I was suicidal to try using them and dying for doing so. I like the concept of this spell and will wait patiently for an upgrade.<P>&gt;ITEM: Whirl til you hurl and Dyn's Dizzying Draught.<BR>&gt;DESCRIPTION: Players feel that these spells are too easily resisted and too easily broken. So much so that they rarely, or never, use it. And these spells make PCs spin, but not NPCs. Having it spin the NPCs would be a nice addition.<P>All I want is a "at distance" stun spell. I heard it was so in the past. Clerics have one. Why couldnt we get it back ?<P>&gt;ITEM: Mesmerization (Charm) Indicator.<BR>&gt;DESCRIPTION: There is a call for a change of the color of a monster’s name when it is under the effects of mez and charm so that people know that monsters are under the affects of these spells just by looking. If it is determine that this would be too useful, making it to easy for the group, we might consider making it so that only the enchanter sees these color changes.<P>If you find it too useful, then I dont think it's necessary to do the color change just for us. I can very quickly know who is my pet by cycling with F1 and targeting the not-pet mobs with the "nearest mob" button. Except with these nasty anonymous skeletons. <P>&gt;ITEM: Pet Positioning.<BR>&gt;DESCRIPTION: Because enchanters can’t tell there pets where to go, they often get in the way. There is a tendency with all pets to stand right in front of their master. This is a bit of a pain when the caster is trying to target something, or just trying to see something. Can pets (all pets) default to standing behind their master?<P>behind ? How do I give them a rusty weapon then ?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>&gt;ITEM: 'Charm wears off'.<BR>&gt;DESCRIPTION: Players report that this message is sometimes sent long after the charm has worn off, after the creature is dead sometimes<P>It happens only when you break charm whith invisibility. Do it with strip enchantment and there is no problem. It seems invis breaks charm but somewhere in the code you forget to tell the message sender that charm isnt working anymore and it acts as if charm continue to work its full duration. <P>Suggestion here: I REALLY would love to have a /pet get lost command for my charmed pets. Dont you find absurd to have to invis yourself to break charm ? The mob isnt even fooled by invis, so why does it break charm ? I can tell my mob to attack its former friends but releasing my control is too complicated ? From a roleplay standpoint it makes no sense. Then it should be a gameplay issue ? Dark elf can already break charm with their hide ability. Are they overpowered ?<P>&gt;ITEM: Mask Faith.<BR>&gt;The solution to the problem here (the problem being that there are now very few enchanters that are not agnostic) might be moving their spells so they don’t have to enter dangerous cities <P>Please DON'T do that. Do you know one of the fun of this class is to go where other people cannot go due to our illusionist advantage ? It's an initiatory rite to "adulthood" to have to go to Neriak getting our enchant spells. An achievement. Don't cheapen the experience of the future enchanters. <P>&gt;ITEM: The Essential Enchanter.<BR>&gt;DESCRIPTION: Some thought should be put into why an enchanter is considered ‘essential’ in a Kunark group, and perhaps change that. If this is determined to be a problem, then perhaps allowing some of the other classes to be better at the skills where they overlap with an enchanter (such as bards and crowd control...) would be a solution.<P>(Remember that necros are NOT a crowd control class by definition please)<P>&gt;Rune IV:<BR>&gt;DESCRIPTION: The cost of the gem used to cast this spell might be too high.<P>I never use Rune4 due to the gem cost.<P>&gt;ITEM: Global Mana Regen Idea.<BR>&gt;DESCRIPTION: The idea would be to reduce the power of all forms of mana regeneration. Then, increase the basic level of mana regeneration for everyone, both standing and sitting. Alter this so that the over all effect of meding with Clarity is the same. This would lower the value of Clarity and increase the ability of all casters that are not grouped with an enchanter. Obviously this is a radical idea that would make the game easier.<P>Are they too many enchanters that you find we should be made a less valueable class ? I'm sure you wouldnt make the same change with the running speed of PCs and Sow.<BR>I like to make my group more effective. It's my job, my concept. I'm not a soloer, but a group enhancer class. If you want to give a better mana regeneration to all caster classes please do, but why doing that to our cost ?<P>&gt;ITEM: Targeting.<BR>&gt;DESCRIPTION: Enchanters in particular would like better targeting abilities. Being able to cycle through all NPCs in view with one key (like F8) would certainly make their lives easier. Though it should be kept in mind that it's not supposed to be too easy.<P>I would really find a use to a /filter command that allows me to select the returned targets between: mobs, PCs, corpses. If I could just filter the corpses when I have to click for selection during the fights and bring it back when it's looting time, it would change my life. <P>&gt;ITEM: Illusion, Group Elemental (or race).<BR>&gt;DESCRIPTION: A spell that grants the elemental illusions (or race illusions) to the group.<P>They are day after day new items coming out that mimic our illusions. Even the garou illusion is not our trademark anymore now (I'm thinking bards here but also boon of the garou, which I'm not a big fan of). One day in everquest you will see illusionned PCs and you wont be able to tell anymore if he is an enchanter/illusionist or any other class. <BR>You are defending the uniqueness of the undead illusions of the necromancers, the bear illusion of the druids and chamans (dont let me start on the summon monster line...). Could you defend one of our illusions at least ? <BR>Another point : I find group illusions disturbing; you cannot tell who is who anymore and it's very annoying in a hot battle. <P>&gt;ITEM: Illusion Monster (and any copycat illusion).<BR>&gt;DESCRIPTION: A spell that lets the enchanter copy the appearance of either a random monster in the zone, or a targeted creature. Keeping faction issues in mind, this might be possible if this were to only work on specific NPCs in any given zone.<P>The only illusion I would like to see. I dont understand where the faction issue is. When I came to upper guk the first time I wasn't kos. After some kills I was. Is there major troubles in this dungeon because of this unfair advantage ? Same with Najena. Under any elemental illusion I'm not kos there for a long time. Same with the Hole and the brell worshippers. <BR>How do you expect us to exploit this advantage ? I cannot see.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I want to take issue with Absor's idea of pulling out magic resistance as a general concern.  The problem that enchanters have with high magic resistance is specific to our class.  This dilutes the issue.<P>No other class suffers the same restriction as enchanters when it comes to resistances.  Every other casting class has a variety of spells that use different resistances, so that even if a monster is immune to one class of spells, they are probably susceptible to another.  They may not be able to use their favorite spells, but they will be able to do *something*.  <P>This is not true of enchanters.  Every spell we have is based on magic resist.  A creature that is immune to magic-based spells is untouchable.<P>And please, don't give us some stupid pet like the cleric hammer as a solution to zones full of magic immune creatures.  It's an ok solution for super melee boss mob battles where there aren't any guards popping back up that need to be taken care of and our mana draining capacity is not needed.  Honestly, it doesn't bother me all that much that there are fifteen minutes at a stretch where I am not special.  But I really don't want to be a buff-o-matic with or without a brain damaged pet in half the high level zones of Norrath.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I'm not grouped with them, never buffed them before, never engaged the cougar, which is now down to close to half HP.  I cast two Rune III spells and suddenly the cat is ripping into me and these two can't pull it off even tho' I still did not engage the mob or cast any other spells on those who were.<P>2. Watching a friend play in SK, grouped at a gnoll spire.  Two tanks and a wizard are beating on a gnoll and have it at just below half HP when the enchanter nukes it.  Sure enough, despite the fact that the nuke was resisted (and therefore zero damage done), this gnoll then proceeds to stick to the enchanter like glue.<P>The built in mega-taunt of the enchanter spells is one of if not *the* primary cause of death.  Not just tash but with many other spell lines as well, the aggro seems very disproportionate compared to other casters and taunting tanks.<P>SG</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>****************************************************************************************************<BR>Mask of Faith spell?<P>Hrmmm... you have addressed that there is a problem with people not picking agnostic as thier religion.  But to give us a mask of faith spell (if you do that is, or if the developers even think that this is a problem) then why should I pick something other then agnostic for if i pick a religion i have to wait till i get to X level to get my mask Faith Illusion that can wear off?  <P>Make items or allow us to use some specific items that an Enchanter can use?  Heh i am a gnome an worship Brell and i still can't get the chain tunic on Tallon Zek for there is no recipies and it costs to much to even make it.  Lets see even IF you add mask of faith spell and even IF you allow certain items to be used by enchanters that worship a god  many will still pick agnostic for if you pick agnostic you do not have to worry about the mask of faith spell and as for a few specific items i do not create a character with the thoughts that hey I can use XXX loot if i worship Tunare... bleh too bad it will be off a ultra-rare spawn or uber guild quest only.  Sorry there is not enough items in the game that are religion specific that an enchanter would crave.  Also think that those that are agnostic are gonna be annoyed if you put in religion specific items for enchanters for they picked agnostic for it was the only sane thing to do.<BR>****************************************************************************************************<BR>Rememdies.... everytime you cast an illusion it masks your faith and gives you a base faction of the illusion.  By doing this you do not anger the agnostic folk and you don't anger the Religious folk.  Also add more religion specific items for all races and classes into the game with some items being all/all and some being caster or melee specific.  By doing this you reward those that have picked a religion that did not have to pick a religion. <BR>****************************************************************************************************<P>         This is a game design issue and needs to be resolved... please do not through in a few enchanter only ultra rare or useless items to please those that picked a religion for we are not that naive.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The essential enchanter....  *sigh*  another game design issue.  Some Kunark groups require crowd control... i'll give you that.  But there are other ways then Mezz to do crowd control depend on where you are.  ie snare/fear  or root parking or harmony, having a monk pull and feign death.  Depending on where you are sometimes you need an evac person or a cleric for rezzes.  This is all game design issues.  A healer is essential in almost all groups.  You have made druids and shamans a poor mans choice of a healer but they can do it in a pinch if they have to.  With this logic you apply this to the class of crowd control.  I state that there is already various forms of crowd control and if you think that the game design issue on one of your game expansion warrants that you blur the lines a little more between classes then i say just change the zone a little bit.  Add safe parts to the zone so that a monk or druid (ie harmony) can pull safely.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Illusion: Wolf - I dont mind if they get JBoots speed but giving them the full benefits that druids get from SOW/Wolf Form should be reserved for them alone. For the record Wolf Form is believed to be about 60% speed, JBoots is believed to be 30% speed.<P>Illusion: Races - Your also forgetting the PvP nerf to illusions. Fix for this is removing illusions both on the caster and the target if any mezmerize spell cast lands (just before it takes effect it drops both illusions) this will 100% undoubtedly fix the permamez bug.<P>Undead Illusions - As long as Enchanters arent getting HP:Mana from these spells they're in line with what enchanters do.<P>Lull Spells - Like I said in the Cleric thread. Make these spells check like Lifetap/Stinging Swarm lines. Virtually unresistable unless the thing is seriously out of your level range.<P>Whirl spells - Please dont spin NPCs, this will piss rogues off to no end.<P>Mez overwriting - Overwriting of Mez spells should be based on DURATION. A level 60 AOE mez spell that lasts 2 minutes would overwrite the level 4 single target mez spell that lasts 30 seconds. This way Enchanter MEZ overwrite Bards and Mezzes get overwritten by better longer-duration mezzes. Also worry over type of Mez wont matter as if your using an unresistable level 60 mez on something that lasts 30 seconds on something thats 100% MR and someone tries to cast a level 55 mez that lasts 5 minutes on the same target will be bounced by the MR.<P>Mez/Charm indicator: Great idea and it should be reasonable that people will notice what is mezzed/isnt by looking at them... are their eyes glazed over are they sleeping or what... Stuff that cant be shown by the game as is.<P>Low level Evokation Practice: Just use your level 8 nuke sheesh.<P>Boon of Garou: Great spell, I agree adding 10-30 seconds to the duration would be nice to keep it up on 2 people at once. I believe that was the initial intent of the spell designer.<P>Global Mana Regen: Just make it so that at 34 current standing mana regen as if your medding, medding (or sitting) adds to it as it would before and clarity spells and such should remain the same. Sure it would help out in soloing but those of us who are sick of staring at that blue bar that seems to crawl like a snail are sick of it. Besides the fact is a warrior can do hundreds more damage than we can on a full tank of mana if they just get a few heals. Much more mana efficient and nomatter how you slice it that red bar is alot easier to get back to full than the blue one.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I have a 29 enc and this is my first and only character so I have done a lot of research on the enchanter!  I think the list of changes are some VERY GOOD ideas and would commpliment us wonderful enchanters nicely!<P>a few notes:<BR>illusion form when you zone. This would be a wonderderful addition!  It is a pain to cast illusion then invis just to make it to the next zone then find another safe place to RE-CAST illusion again. This would be very helpful!<BR>*WONDERFUL IDEA*<P>Tiny Daggers Addition to Qeynos is not a big deal b/c you could just take the boat.  But at the same time NOT having to wait on the boat or a port to Erudin is WONDERFUL!  Adding more places to buy things MORE VENDORS in the empty huts and houses would be nice!  IMHO I think every continent should have a minium of one place to buy most items (other than city specific items)!<BR>*VERY HELPFUL*<P>Pet positioning<BR>I agree beside or behind is wonderful Since you are the MASTER he should walk 10 paces behind you (just kidding)  but behind would be great!<BR>*I LOVE THIS IDEA*<P>Canta and clarity SHOULD stack not only does it make us enc useful and wanted in a group It makes the BARD a great addition too b/c it make's my job as an (traffic cop, buffer, debuffer, and blaster) enchanter much easier!<BR>*PLEASE LET THESE STACK*<P>Rune<BR>I dont use any of these spells b/c they require comonents and dont last long I think you should either lower the amount of the stone or make the amount of time it stays on you last longer (IMHO make it worth the money as it is i dont think its worth the money)<BR>*LOWERING COST AWESOME IDEA*<P>Thicken mana<BR>Should be a vial you drink to regain all your mana when you are oom!  I have no clue what these are actually for and I can't find anyone that REALLY knows! What or how this was indended to be used!<BR>*MAKING THIS MORE USEFUL IS ANOTHER GREAT IDEA*<P>Perfect group<BR>When I was below the level of 16 I couldn't get a group to save my life!  Once I got breeze everything changed please dont take away my ability to be VERY welcome in a group <BR>Enc's are wanted b/c we play traffic cop, buffer, debuffer, rooter, and nuker.  When i form a group (when i do we usually ROCK!) 2 tanks any kind! a druid a cleric and any other class prefer either a bard or mage/wiz!<P>Having a little more pet control would be nice but we REALLY cant and shouldn't have it all!  I do agree with the pet attacking as soon as the master attacks!<BR>*THAT WOULD MAKE A MUCH BETTER PET*<P>I absolutely Hate components of any kind but hey that is just part of the game if you do keep all the components going with all the spells you SHOULD make the components more readily available!<P>Hope this helps<BR>ZURI  :-)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000774-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000774.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000774-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000774-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000774-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000774&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000774&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
