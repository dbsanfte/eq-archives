</FONT><HR>Hi Elbrop,<P>I don't have a guild, nor am I a member of any guild, but I am looking, and here is where I found a great list for all the servers, including the Nameless:<P>http://everquest.allakhazam.com/Guildlinks.htm<P>In a previous post a number of guilds were mentioned, 7th Legion, Falcon's Pride (not accepting new members at this time), Nameless Templars, Fallen Wolves, Eye of the Ages, and the Brethern of the Mystic Dawn (sorry if I missed any). All of these are listed there. All in all, 20+ "Nameless" guilds with links are listed at that site.<P>You may have already seen it (sounded like you were trying to "draw" out individuals from the different guilds), but I thought I would list the site in case people haven't seen it.<P>Shaman Mjodvitnir</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The problem I've had is finding the right guild.<P>I joined one and it turned out I was 7 levels above their highest member and the conversation was like a Jr. High locker room. <P>I then went to Allakhazam's site and found a guild which sounded right, had lots of members, etc. But when I went in the game and checked there were never more than three members of this guild on at one time.<P>Another guild mentioned here sounded good and they had a lot of members online. I found a group of them (a good sign) and asked them about their guild. No one would even answer me.<P>I've given up. I'm a 35 druid unable to find a good-sized, socially mature guild. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I think I'm the youngest member of the guild at age 17, and the conversation is usually rather cultured.

</FONT><HR>Hail All,<P>One of the Newest yet smallest private guild is the "Sanguin Circle". Great group of frreindly helpful players. Great values and smart hunting make this group a good all around team for many hunts. We are currently mid-low level with the Highest members at Level 27, but we are growing together. We ensure that we help one another and that we KNOW one another.<BR> Hunting together is encouraged and we try to be very good at it. We have not yet begun to interact with many other guilds but soon many will know of the Circle. We are mainly a group of Evil races, being Dark elves, Traolls and ogres, but we can make a few exceptions, Rouges are encouraged <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> But good races can be used. We have a few druids also. Unkempt, hehe<BR>Well if your looking for solid hunting partners and a good time were everyone knows you. Go to http:\\Sanguin.Jinpachu.com and read the guild charter. after that give one of the officers a tell in game and let us know if you wish to join. You will find that we enjoy the full aspect of the game, so Twinking and Powerleveling are not allowed, nor is grouping with twinks looked upon favorably, Earn what you have for your charachters, but we will aid you in getting items that are attainable. well check us out<P>Arkkada Entreri<BR>Sanguin Circle (Blood Circle)<BR>27th level Mage<BR>Warrior Mage Extrordinaire<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hye ye, just wanted to promote my guild, the<BR>              Bone Clan Pirates<P>Sorry don't have the website info on hand. We just got our website set-up and I am at work and dont have the address on hand.<P>We are a very mature guild, outta game and also one in the game.  Most of our members are above 20 and with-in the coming month all of them will be.  We only except new members above lvl 20 now. Now before you start flaming here is the reasons.<P>1. controling over population- We dont want to end up like the Sun Szu guild with over 350 members.  Sorry that just frieghtens the hell outta us.<BR>2. Mature players that know what they are doing and have established a charecter they like and will stick with it. This is very important to us. We need a stable guild to function properly. (many of us do have multiply chars. I have 6 myself but only have one I play regularly. The rest are just as mules and for some fun to play around  with.)<BR>3. We will not tell someone no they cant join because we dont need them.  We think this very unfair when a guild will do this.<BR>"sorry we already have too many wizards we dont want you" or "We are not recruiting anymore. I dont care if the guy is your friend."  We want to be fair to every body and the best way we can figure to do this is with a lvl requirement.<P>Now this lvl requirement applys to us too. No second chars allowed till after they reach lvl 20.<P>For some info on our guild.<P>1. We are strong. We are not race or class specific.  To many guilds will start a guild composed of only one race/class and latter on find them selves lacking in ability and very weak at the latter lvls of its members.<BR>It is one thing to be playing a weak charecter but another altogather to have an entire guild just as weak as you.  <BR>2. We work togather very often and have many contacts outside of our guild.<BR>3. We help each other and are kind people. The "pirate" in our name is just that, a name. Which just happens to be the coolest guild name on the Nameless. We have had people that wanted to join just because they like our name. <BR>4. We currently have over 50 pluss members. Ye not much but with the majority over lvl 25 and made up of every class there is. We are a very capable guild.<BR>5. We our mature and fair. We treat people like people and act like adults. Most of us work and support our selves, even though when we get bored we act like goof balls but thats just part of the fun. We have planty of personality to go around, and will shut up quick if we offend anyone. We will somtimes talk like adults and talk smack to each other and tell dirty jokes but only if the present company allows it.  <BR>3. We dont like KSers, rudeness, and people with no consideration for others. I play a dark elf and the people that really flame me  the most our the ones that will hurt someone else and call it role-playing. When having fun involves hurting some one else it is no longer considered fun but bullying.<BR>4. We dont mind campers. We have done it our selves to pick up items to outfit our guild but we will not tolerate threats or rudeness to get rid of the compation.  <BR>5. Dont expect nothing from us. We often give out things we dont need or buy things for other people but only because we want to not because we have to.  <BR>6. Sometimes we will do guild quest to obtain stuff for a guild member. To be the lucky recipatant of this adventure we ask that you be a part of the guild for at least a month.<BR>7. We have our meetings on Wedsday night at 9:00 eastern time. The location varies but it is most often in the Freeport area.  At the end of the meeting we hold raffles, were we donate 5pp then pick a number and who evers number is closest to the number drawn gets the prize.<P>Thier are so many good things I can say about the guild. I have been a part of it sense creation and am very please with it.<BR>I hope I have said enough to properly repersent the guild. If anyone has any questions or would just like to ask about it you can give me a tell or the guild leader one, Brotherbones. I will post our website as soon as I can. It isnt much right now because it is new but it will develope in time.<P>Damu Stratuhel <BR>Dark Elf, Necromancer<BR>Bone Clan Pirates<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Regarding the Hand of Mana...<P>I enjoyed reading your website but as an evil troll who enjoys causing fear (after all the lord of Fear is my God) I have to respond to this quote. <P>“A hand can be used to support, build, comfort, communicate, and discipline. A hand is made of individual digits that work together to common goals, and are stronger together than as individual units. When one joins the Hand of Mana, you are metaphorically clasping the Hand of fellowship.”<P>Here is my counter argument  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>A hand can also be used to grasp and control. Yes while a hand has many fingers they all obey one mind that controls and directs them in the pursuit of the minds desires. Strength come from power, a clenched fist will gain more than a cowardly open hand.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>There are many good guild mentioned in this thread and I would like to add another. <P>The Avengers Federation is a guild for mature players that is more of an on-line community then an EQ guild. At present we are established on four servers in EQ, 2 servers in UO, and 1 server on AC. We are a group of individuals that enjoy that mature company of one another. We welcome anyone that has a good attitude and we ask for mothing in return. We are selective in membership only when a player shows greed to be their motivating factor IE wanting items or higher level power leveling time. When other guilds treat us with respect and honor we do the same for them. We have members from all over the world that play at diffrent times of the day so the is usually some member on at all times. Our goal is to have an on-line mature community of players that can gather in any on-line game and enjoy the knowledge that someone you know and trust is there to experiance the new adventure. We have plans to expnd into Neverwinter Nights, UO2, Shadowbane, Horizons ( a game by artifact-entertainment I believe.) We have some very talented members and a new web site will be opening soon. <P>Our old web site is www.wobblewire.com<P>North Silvercloud <BR>Avengers Federation High Council <P>aka <P>Syyrinia<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>While I would be feign to in any manner contradict a learned and noble soul, especially one of the trollish persuasion, as an officer of the Hand of Mana, I just have to put my spin on your spin of our Web Pages' discussion on the symbology of the Hand. (/em places tongue firmly in cheek)<P>Obviously, symbology is terribly personal to anyone, and various groups tend to interpret a symbol in many different ways.  As a Master Linguist, I see this often in the Troll language: after all, your word for Hand, "Skorgg," translates roughly into: "That which bashes."  Certainly colourful, but considering that in trollish there are 13 names for body parts, 17 different types of weapons, 13 names of cooking utensils, and two names for froglok corpses that also happen to translate into "That which bashes," it can make an Erudite scholar such as myself understand how your vision of a hand can be, er, fist-centric.<P>  Mind you, this is not to knock your vision of the use of your fingers, but I also know that the more common slang in troll for your digits, "Skruggles," are among the 117 words and phrases that translate into "Those things that scratch my fanny."  In fact, not to be rude, but it reminds me that if we used trollish Symbology for Hands in our Guild Symbology, we would have to be "The Itching Hand of Mana."  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Father Azerun says in Troll, Yours Sincerely,<P>Father Azerun<BR>Linguist and Renassiance Mage<BR>Hand of Mana<P><BR>PS:  Some of my absolute favorite roleplayers come from the Dead Humans' Society, an evil and from what I can tell mostly Trollish (Well met, NubNub and Zagazot!) which are just a kick in the cloth pants as a guild.  Falcon's Pride and the Fallen Wolves' are most noble guilds, and both I always will aid personally based on my observance of their honorable reputation. I have also found members of the 7th Legion reputable, although my dealings with them far fewer. Dynasty of Caliber seems be to a new up and coming guild, which I will watch with great interest; but my vote for most colourful Guild Name goes to the Sisters of Deceit, an apparently all-female Guild.  But are you going to trust someone from a Guild called Sisters of Deceit with treasure division? -FA</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
