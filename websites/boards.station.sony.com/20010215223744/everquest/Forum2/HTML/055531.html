I figured that since I've done necromancers, this would be a good next step.<BR>First, let me admit that I have done no research about what shadow knight player concerns are. I just haven't had the time, and I probably won't for the rest of these talks.<P>The idea here is to present me with the things that you see as wrong with the shadow knight class. I'd like to focus on class balance issues, but it seems clear to me now that I may as well jot down any bugs or other issues that you have while I'm at it. And don't be afraid to tell me what you think is good about the class too.<P>Alan<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think that I can sum up what the SK needs to finally balance it out with the game and the other classes.<P>1.  I think SK's and Pallies should have their weapon skill caps raised to that of Warriors while keeping the offence, dodge, parry and reposte skills as they currently are.  They should be exelent with thwie chosen weapon, just not as good at offence as Warriors.<P>2.  Upping the defence skill is great.<P>3.  Increase our bash/slam skill to that of Warriors.  After all, we use shields more often then any Warrior, we should at least be as good in the skill.<P>3.  Paladins have all kinds of neat quests for weapons.  We are KoS everyplace and can't even go to the plane of our Gods without getting killed.  Paladins can go to their Gods planes and get weapon quests.  I would like to have a quest that is as EASY as Natures Defender and yields just as good of a weapon.<P>4.  Faction.  I hunted in High Pass Hold for 6 levels, I'm STILL KoS there!!!  I would think that after spending weeks killing Orcs and Gnolls they would consider me a nicer guy.  I don't know what it is but my SK has a heck of a time getting faction.  I hunted Lguk on and off for 15 lvls, I'm still KoS in Uguk!!  Gee wiz.<P>Also, that VS issue is just no right.  If I hunt and Karnors I will go KoS in OT within a few hours.  Once you are KoS to VS faction you can NEVER EVER fix it and get into OT outpost.  A Paladin can hunt in PoG, kill their GOD lose faction, become KoS and then hunt a few hours in Crushbone and get their faction back.  This VS thing is just a kick in the nads to all evil class/races.<P>5.  The lvl 39 Spell Shadow Vortex is a 12pt AC drain.  The lvl 50 Spell Shround of Pain is an 18pt AC drain.  I thought that Shroud of Pain was a Proc like Vampiric Embrace, it does not seem to be working as intended.  If it is supposed to be a Proc then it is not working as one.  If it was designed as a drain then it is only marginally better then Shadow Vortex and is just another example of a watered down upgrade like THE DISCIPLINE OF UNHOLY AURA which is a redundant HT upgrade that essentially causes us to use 2 special abilities to get 1 effect.  Paladins don't have to use their LoH to get SANCTIFICATION to work.<P>6.  Lastly, is there some way to allow us to give mana to other casters?  On big raids I'm pretty much sitting on may hands waiting for everyone to get wiped out so that I can be usefull and summon a few corpses.  I always have a full mana bar, or at least enough mana to be able to give some to the Cleric so he can heal the Warrior.  At least a Paladin can step back and heal, LoH or buff.<P>Thanks a lot.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A SK/Pally would not be as good at offence or do as much damage as a Warrior with an skill cap 30 points lower and no dual wield in offence.  Raising the SK/Pallies weapon skills to that of a Warriors would allow them to do more damage then they do now, just not as much as the warrior.  It works the same as raising an SK/pallies defence to that of a Warrior but leaving the Dodge/parry/reposte skills as they are now.  SK/Pallies become better at tanking but not better then a Warrior.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>Our major problem will still be the tanking of the boss-type MOBs even if the changes on Test go live.<P>We need a revamped Leechcurse or a new discipline that will mitigate some damage from those type of MOBs.  Or, some other way to make us useful on a raid.  No, summon corpse spell does not make us more usefull because Necros have a better version of the spell.<P>Our spells will still have problems at high levels.<P>level 59:<BR>Cascading Darkness, casting time 7 seconds, 1152 DoT over 1 minute 36 seconds for 300 mana.<P>level 60:<BR>Asystole, casting time 6.1 seconds, 690 DoT over 1 minute for 210 mana<P>Drain Spirit, casting time 5.3 seconds, 226 lifetap for 189 mana.<P>Test level 60:<BR>Drain Soul, casting time 6.1 seconds, 338 lifetap for 225 mana<P>What is wrong with these spells?  Casting time!  SK is primarily a melee class and casting these spells is practically impossible.<P>Solution?  Replace these spells with a SK only versions that have low casting time but also do less damage and cost less mana.<P>I don't know if you will be willing to modify the existing spells as it may be seen as a nerf by some.  However, consider it with the new spell you're adding at level 60 - Drain Soul.<P>Instead of Drain Soul add a lifetap that has shorter casting time but still has about same mana/hp conversion rate.<P>Another problem is the Darkness line of our spells.  Make it stackable with snare line of spells.  There were many times when I did not cast my darkness spells only because I knew that it would produce a fleeing MOB at the end of the fight.<P>Harm Touch should be made unresistable.  1501 damage is not a lot to a boss-type MOB.  May want to add a after death refresh timer of 2-3 minutes to prevent SKs from dying and using the HT immediately after ressurrection.<P>Give us a spell that makes us look like a skeleton (level 58 version one).  Just for fun!<P>Think about raising our dodge/parry/riposte and our weapon skills.<P>Make our pets moer controllable.  Enable us to tell the pet not to attack unless explicitly told to attack.<P>That's about all I can think about right now.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>So far, I think Verant's taking steps in the right direction with Shadow Knights...the only things that I can see are:<P>1) Our disciplines <P>I do admit that since Shadow Knights are hybrids that we shouldn't get as many disciplines as warriors. But warriors have a much wider variety of disciplines than we do, and I think to better live up to our "3/4 warrior, 1/4 necro" image, we should be given a few more disciplines. Specifically, I think that shadow knights need an auto-dodge, auto-parry, or auto-riposte discipline. This could at least ease up the effect of the warriors' better tanking ability. What would be even better would be if shadow knights and maybe pallies got a unique discipline with an effect not available to their parent classes...I won't make any suggestions (because they'd probably just be scrapped), but I think you Verant guys get the general idea. A good discipline addition  using this idea this could make Shadow Knights much more group friendly. <P>2)Our Skill Caps<P>You guys at Verant seem to at least be attempting to fix our deficiency in the tanking area, and I think a little upping of our dodge, parry, riposte and (maybe) disarm would be a nice addition.<P>3) Darkforge Armor<P>Really, I think this stuff is TOO HARD to get. You don't exactly see a shadow knight at level 22 wearing darkforge armor like warriors wear crafted. I think that you guys should make the darkforge quest easier, even if just by a little bit. <P>Well I guess that's about it, my 2cp for the SK talk thread.<P>Kazram Dreadnight<BR>Troll Shadow Knight of Torvonnilous<P>"Is the best defense a good offense or is the best offense a good defense?"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Locnar I vehemently disagree with you and anyone else who want's our damage absorbtion line of spells removed/replaced. True, shieldskin is pretty useless, but that is only because we get it too late. We should be getting it at level 30 and an upgrade to it at 39.<P>Steelskin, however, is one of the best spells that we ever get and I can not wait to have diamondskin (though it's use will be limited due to the expensive regent). I probably use steelskin more than I use boil blood, our pets, and all of the post 50 lifetaps combined. The only bad thing about the spell is that it is a major taunt and that it requires a regent.<P><BR>I definately do support the idea of SK's getting the shielding line of spells. SK's are the only hybrid without any type of buff line and the shielding line would provide us with a nice line of self buffs that enhances our ability to tank a little bit in group situations (it doesnt stack with the talisman line so probably would not be used too much in big raids) but does not provide such a big enhancement that it would overpower us.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hey if Diamond Skin cost 100pp I'd still use it.<BR>In certain situations money is less valuable than surviving. I would imagine if I was a necro I would coax some newbies (bribe) to die for those stones they need hehe.<P>I think the biggest issue I see for Higher Level Shadow Knights is our inability to hit properly.  Please look at our horrible miss rate on mobs 40+ and address that issue.  It probably can be fixed with a weapon skill increase which in my opinion should be the same for all hybrids and capped at the Warrior cap.<P>Next issue is we need better BASH skill.  Take away Disarm its worthless at current cap.  Would be nice to have either a pet intensification line or more sheild skin line of spells.  <P>Make the shield skin lines come in to play earlier in Shadow Knights life... as it is theyre almost worthless and become completely worthless 5 levels after you get them.<P>In my opinion our Dodge and Parry skill should be the same as Warriors.  However if you dont adjust the Rangers Defense I can live with the lower cap.  However if Rangers get more defense then we should get more defense in terms of dodge and parry skills.  (Sounds like class envy.. well I dont think it is... its more a balance issue).<P>Quite frankly our lack of Duel wield is a large impact on the damage we do.  I dont want duel wield but please consider this large disadvantage when balancing the classes.<P>Would be nice to get triple attack but that probably wont happen.  The reason this would not be unbalancing is that we dont have duel wield so would not be as powerful as Warriors and it would help us in our huge miss rates that we see fighting blue mobs.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>From reading these threads and seeing responses by the people in charge, it seems to me the vision of hybrids is this:<BR>Rangers - offensive<BR>Bards - all around utility (and songs)<BR>Paladin/SK - defensive<P>Now, with this is mind, why is it that, although Paladins and Shadow Knights are supposed to be THE defensive hybrids, BOTH those classes are the ONLY hybrids that do not have a defensive discipline! <P>Rangers, at level 60, get Weaponshield. This allows them to parry ALL attacks directed at them for 15 seconds, making them invulnerable to melee attacks in that time. <P>Bards, at level 55, get Deftdance. This gives them the ability to automatically dodge EVERY attack AND automatically duel wield (off hand chance to swing will be 100%) for 10 seconds, making them invulnerable to melee attacks in that time and doing increased damage.<P>Now Paladins DO have a defensive skill at 60. Sanctification, making them immune to MOST (and I need a pally to tell me what most includes) types of harmful spells. If this makes them immune to "uber" mob AoE spells, this is an excellent ability. This, however, SILL precludes them 'taunting' a mob off a warrior to share damage, or off a spell caster to keep them alive because, even WITH a higher defensive skill, Paladins just aren't going to last against mobs that may very well be over 60.<P>Shadow Knights, on the other hand, do NOT have a defensive ability per se. Although it can be argued that Leechcurse, the level 60 discipline that heals self for every point of damage done, CAN be argued to be defensive, it is by no means an effective defensive discipline. Shadow Knights, according to Verant, are NOT an offensive class, we do NOT have the same skill caps in offense or weapons as warriors, rogues, monks, or rangers. We do NOT hit as often, and do not do as much damage, even with the same weapon, due to our lower attack rating. <P>If we can't hit, and do less damage when we DO hit, this skill is useless. I GUARANTEE you, if I'm supposed to be "defending" the others in my group and raid, and by this I presume to mean taunting and taking hits, the amount of damage I do to the mob and heal myself IN NO WAY will offset the amount of damage I take, being single, double, triple, and even quad hit for 300 to 600 (or more) points of damage per shot. <P>I propose giving Shadow Knights (and Paladins) Weaponshield.  I would suggest level 58, getting a defensive ability 2 levels higher than warriors (5 levels higher than monks and rogues) but sooner than Rangers, we being the 'defensive' hybrid and they being the 'offensive' hybrid.  This would in no way "step on the toes" of fighters (warrior/monk/rogue), given their ability to auto parry AND riposte every attack, but still give us the ability to actually 'defend' those in our raid and live to tell about it. The amount of damage we prevent with this will be MUCH greater then the amount of damage we can 'heal' ourselves. <P>This ability alone would, at the very least, make us a viable option to the fighter classes if no or not enough are available. We wouldn't be AS good, but at least we'd be effective. And if WE are more effective, the whole RAID will be more effective. Fighters disciplines last a few seconds, when their discipline ends an SK could taunt off the fighter, keeping THEM alive, while still allowing them to do the massive amounts of damage they can do. If you want us (including Paladins, they could use this ability as well) to be "Defenders" then you have to give us the ability to defend. Otherwise, it's like telling us you want us to be pilots, and not supplying us with a plane . . . <P>Whaddaya think?<P>- Vorrek, 52 SK, Quellious<P>P.S.

</FONT><HR>Absor said on the Paladin talk thread:<P><BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;I've been thinking about this. I think what we need to do is determine who will primarily use what weapon combo, and lead them that way (by no means forcing them into those roles). I see that there are really three types of weapon combos, 2-handed, 1-handed and shield, and two weapons. Off the top of my head, I'd say 2-handers for shadow knights, weapon and shield for paladins, two weapons for warriors and bards… &lt;&lt;&lt;<P>If there is one thing that I can not stress enough it's that the overwelming majority of Shadow Knights prefer one handed weapon/shield combos over two handers. If you took a poll of what high level Shadow Knights use you would find that probably 98% of us use a one handed weapon/shield. As a matter of fact the only high level SK's on my server that I know of that use two handers are the three that have their epic weapon, and even they choose two use a one handed/shield combo over their epic in many situations.<P>Verant seems to have an image of SK's as being Ogers and Trolls who can slam, but the truth is the majority of people who play SK's play the small/medium races and even the people who play the large races generally prefer to use a one hand/shield combo.<P>Part of it is image, we are Knights, and as such we see ourselves as weilding a sword and shield, not some big clumsy two handed sword, and part of it is function. IF we don't have a shield equiped we can't bash, and it is unacceptable not to be able to bash. And of course their is also the issue of AC/stats/resists that are present on shields. <P>So basicaly what I am saying is that SK's, along with Paladins would like to see more one hand/shield combos, a one handed weapon/shield epic combo, and of course to have our bash skill raised to a more apropriate level.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Speaking as one of the "2%" of shadowknights who do use 2hand slash as their primary weapon, I'd REALLY like improvements done to this particular form of weaponskill.<P>Dark Reaver and the Epic Weapon are both 2hand slash, and both are SK only! I agree that bash ought to be increased substancially, but I also think that hybrids ought to be able to specialise in ONE weaponskill...taking that one skill to somewhere close to a warrior cap.<P>Let us be able to choose our weapon! I want to be able to inflict reasonable damage with my weapon of choice. I want to be a knightly blademaster/mistress of my chosen weapon. Unlike the warrior I do not have knowledge of all weapons, but I ought to (as a KNIGHT) be more than competant at wielding a sword, not a master of slashing at thin air!!<P>2hand slash needs to be a reasonable weapon choice for small race shadowknights post lv50. I don't want to go 1hand + shield because that is NOT how I visualised my lady knight to fight, but it seems I have no choice but to go this way.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>Please make 2hand slash a viable alternative by giving us bash enabled 2handers, which have a faster swing delay.

Please look hard at my suggestion. HYbrids on the eqforge sk chat forum are really agree able to this.<P><BR>-Thanks for the new spells this is the collective sk thoughts.<P>-grim aura , no thanks give us a low level nuke maybe instead or posion bolt, a fast action dot of the posion line which we have none of. This would add to our versitilty.<BR>-Duplication of lifetaps is getting rediculous.  W have like 4 new taps posst 50.  Add to this fact we get maybe 15 new spells total thats seems a great waste to me.  remove the 51 tap, and the currnetly 56 one.  You can keep the currnet 60 one and drain soul also on the spell lin.  Those are the only ones that even aporach the uselfeull ness of the 50 life leech. Even though the are super slow but I can live with that.<P>replace these 2 spells with- <BR>-an illusion spell that gives us a skeletal or zombie look. adds a small call of bones effect, increase attack and maybe dext and str, reduces agil and charissma and somthing elle.  Maybe lose 5 hps per tic also as a drawback.  This would ad the the FUN factor of the class, we need our own lich type spell for gods sake. PLSEAE !!!!<BR>-Either another dot of the deiseee line, say scourge, or maybe root? heh we should get ROOT I really feel. May times I am camping a spawn and I have no way to keep a mob off me while I med.  Necros start this line at 34. I beleive we should start it at around 58 or somthing. would help us do a tad of crowd control in a pinch too. since you'll never give us even a nerfed verison of Screaming terror.<P>-FInaly note , you give us the 29 necro dot over time at 57.  This is not good at all please. mobs at 51 reguraly hit me for doubles 130s etc. at 56 I get hit for 200 regulary. This spell taps 200 hps for 144 mana at 57.  Thats not even one round of combat.  AT thise level I'd rather cast drian spirt for immediate hps for maybe 40 more mana if I really needed hps that bad, thus rendering this line useless.  <BR>*****<BR>Change this spell to the 44 level BOND of death.  Sure it takes a necro 380 or so mana and would cost us about 440 but it heals a good amount of hps 800 which is just a 3rd of my hps aat 57 I belive over a LONGer duration.  Its an excellent battle spell for us as its dmage and healing over time and will absorb maybe 3 rounds of combat in in all. Its not at aall unreasnable at 57, bump it to 58 or 59 if you must but the current 57 spells is worthless.  This spell would be excellent for us and its way weaker than the upgraded necro version around 55 or 56.<P>Thats all I have, kudos for the changes you are contemplated and this is just my and others humble thoughts on these matters, we love your game and just want to be usefell in the high end game , not relegated to watching the fights from a distance or being considerd worthless to uber guilds.<P>Sterol SoulTaker 56 level Revenat Rallos Zek<P>P.s and upgrade the the new pet haste at maybe 54 would be greatly apreciatted.  10% haste is a drop in the bukket vs reds and evens in the 55+ game  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

With a high dex, agi, str and attack I can only land roughly 40 percent of my blows? Admittedly since Im one of the rare ones using a 2hs (Throneblade of the Ykesha -w- FBSS) I was deffinatly dealing as good as I got, but the wyrms hit faster and more often.  So IMHO I say raise our offense SOME. Im not saying raise it so high we can kite gods, but just some. Heres another concept. Weapons specialization. Casters get spell specializations. Why cant the meeles as a WHOLE get weapons specialties? The skill that hits 200 first can go up higher, the rest freeze at 200. That way you dont have to raise the offense caps at all. It allows the player to choose his own way of doing things without making Verant look like its cheapening the warrior class! Warriors of course specialize in EVERYTHING. But for Hybrids and the other melee's I think specialization is an awesome idea.<P>Next. Moving shieldskin to a lower level. GOOD IDEA. Leaving a huge gap between shieldskin and steelskin/diamond skin, BAD IDEA. Bump Steel to 49! As it is you got it at 56! And your saying Diamondskin at 59? POINTELSS GAP in between! Your talking about a 22 level gap before the next skin, then just 3 to the next and last one? Move steelskin to somewhere between 39-49. Its silly the way it is now.<P>Mana. Unless your a erudite, after 3 casts of dooming darkness Im beggin for C2. Mana goes FAST. Thats with damn near a 130 int. Plus casting times. We dont need necro casting times, were fighters. Need SPEED. More SK only type spells. The shroud line is AWESOME. Need more like those.<P>Whoever said that we should be able to go skeletal/zombie form, your RIGHT. IT shouldnt be a spell tho. Should be a longer lasting discipline. Perhaps even replace the current level 60 at the top of the list. At 60 an SK is so attuned to death that he should have something like that. My idea:A shadow knight is about to die. If he can cast or activate the discipline before death upon his last hitpoints getting removed have him turn into a zombie/skeleton and continue on as a berzerked warrior of the SK's level with a purple bar counting down for a certian ammount of time before succumbing to death. During this time the SK would be immune to all physical attacks. The only thing that would shorten the "deathspan" of the SK would be fire, vs Undead spells, or something extrodinarily powerful like Cazic Thules DT. If struck with any of those the time would be cut in half for each strike until the time runs out. If this disc is used a cleric cannot rez or heal the SK until the clock had expired and the SK returns to his bind point as pet regular death.  This vision is probably stretching it but I think it would be a very cool idea.<P>Thats all I have for now. Ill write again if I come up with anything else.<P>Draveel D'Ezeri-Level 50th Shadow Knight<BR>Priest of Harvest Hybrid Melee<BR>Harbingers of Death<BR>Nameless Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Usually I'm sham buffed to about 210 str and I can see about a 10-15% increase on dmage input with that.<P>For an erudite I'd you have very low str and stam and even agil so it will be a challange at low levels to decide where to put points.  It say put all your points int str to get it to say 70<BR>and try and get stam and agil to near 75 so you don't take the negative ac hit from below average agil.  If you though de's were hard to ballace starting stawise eruidites are a royal pain.<P>Bascally all you neeeto to know is keep your agil above 75 if you can and str and stam 70+ statrting stat wise. my starting stats are<P>80 str, 70 stam 90 agil I thin and 95 dext. lord knows why I put points into dext, should have gone ito stam but that was way back.<P>basically str and stam are key stats for a tank, with agil comming 3rd at lower levels ( at higher levels your ac will be so high only way agil will affect you more that 10 or so ac points is if its crazy high, like 140+ or crazy low , below 75)<P>Peace<P>I play DE btw )</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is something that just came to mind whilst reading through the Paladin balance thread, however it applies to all hybrid and their parent classes.<P>Now what I propose is that Parent classes, ie. Clerics, Necros and Druids be given special spells that will only work on the associated hybrid. These spells could come in at any level, but I was thinking that at upper levels they could embue the hybrid with abilities particularly aimed at boss encounters.<P>The idea here is that the Parent and associated Hybrid can be more potent when they combine their talents. So a Cleric/Paladin, Druid/Ranger and Necro/SK combined would be more powerful in high end encounters than either alone.<P>I think it would be necessary to make these spells quite powerful, since the combination is taking up two positions in the group/raid. Perhaps the spell could also have a detrimental effect on the parent for some duration.<P>Something along the lines of the Druid casting a short lived, but very high regen spell on a ranger, then not being able to cast any offensive spells for it's duration. Mitigate the effect of one buy affecting the other.<P>Well, I think you get the idea, something to consider. It would certainly encourage teaming between these classes, and assuming the spells are potent enough with others as well.<P>(Cross posted to all hybrid threads for opinions).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>way back, someone posted this about SKs...  "Lastly, is there some way to allow us to give mana to other casters? On big raids I'm pretty much sitting on may hands waiting for everyone to get wiped out so that I can be usefull and summon a few corpses. I always have a full mana bar, or at least enough mana to be able to give some to the Cleric so he can heal the Warrior. At least a Paladin can step back and heal, LoH or buff."<P>This is not really something that needs changing. Fact is, SKs mana goes towards combat spells, while paladin spells are made to lessen downtime.

</FONT><HR><BR>I posted this on the paladin thread as this concerns both classes, so just skip if you already read it there.<P>Absor, your recap of the paladin thread got me thinking some more on the subject of disciplines.<BR>Everyone agrees that a lvl 55+ warrior using the Defensive discipline is what's now required with Velious boss mobs to successfully tank them. Short of this, you simply lose your HPs too fast to be healed or even at best make a complete heal effective.<BR>With the upcoming change to the warrior Defensive, where they will be losing a substantial amount of damage dealing power while it's active, warriors may consider using agressive as an alternative, to make MORE damage and hopefully see the mob die faster. But adversely, if they start getting hit, they will see their health drop as your average rogue or ranger...<P>So, if you tend to see paladins and SKs as DEFENSIVE tanks, why not give them the Evasive and Defensive disciplines only, so that when enough of those hybrids are around warriors can switch if they choose so to more agressive and damage dealing disciplines ?<BR>Even if boss mobs tend to resist all the spells we can throw at them, their taunting factor stays pretty much the same, and a pally or SK should should be able to maintain a mob agro on them, even with a lower damage output, even, I'd wager, if it was further lowered by the use of such disciplines as Evasive and Defensive.<P>Warriors get Evasive and 52, give it to SKs and pallies at 57, with a recycle time of 15 mins, so that at lvl 60 it caps at 10 mins, compared to 7 mins for warriors.<P>Give us Defensive at lvl 60, with a recycle time of 15 mins, while at the same lvl it recycles every 10 mins for warriors.<P>The only downside to this idea is that we lose our class-defining disciplines. Well, in practice it's not a big loss, since they prove to be virtually useless against boss mobs. So maybe keep the lvl 60 pally Sanctification and SK Leechcurse and move them down in-between Evasive and Defensive would be an idea, at lvl 57, or lvl 58. Just for flavor.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just some ideas regarding shadowknights I've had lately. Firstly, I've said it before, and I'm more than willing to reiterate again.  Get rid of the pets.  They're too weak and dangerous to use to be really considered useful.  Even if we were given a pet buff you simply cannot make them tough enough to be useful to us without unbalancing the class in comparison to the other hybrids.  Basically they're a waste of mana and bonechips.  Free up these spell slots for something more useful.<BR>Secondly, our spells need to be able to be cast quicker.  I personally prefer to be able to use a shield and one handed weapon in combat, but all too frequently I find myself using my trusty Edge of Cabilis for two reasons, one being that it dishes the damage out at a satisfying speed for my level, and the other being that it's slow enough for me to get my spells off between swings.  The spell/attack lag modifications made recently have been rather helpful, but our spells still cast way too slow for someone who's tanking to try to throw, especially when your ideal goal in a group is to have as many of the mobs you're fighting as possible to be attacking you.  <BR>Third.  I dont want gate, I dont want bind, but I would LOVE to be able to gate directly to my own corpse.  Some kind of Deathgate or such would be dandy.<BR>Fourthly.  Wave of fear, why dont we get this?  <BR>And I guess finally, at least for now.  Some kind of vengeance spell would be perfect for us.  say something that prevented all incoming damage for a reasonable period of time at the end of which we simply die.<BR>Anyways, this is just my opinion from the angle of the game I see.  We've got some good things going for us, just still needs some work.<BR>-Abraxis Townrazor<BR>37 Zealot of Greenmist, Brell Serilis server.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Last night in lguk, we were taking on frenzy, there were only 2 tank in the group me and a monk, well the monk do most of the tanking, even though being lower level, and lower ac the monk seemed to get hit for way less then what i got hit for, and i got pretty high ac, (dont remember it right now) im just saying that it is pretty bad that i could be out tanked my a monk. <P>also they give us a lot of usless spells with HIGH casting times. plus most of us dont have enough mana to cast these spells more then a few times. <P>the fd spells also need to get looked at, most of the time when fd doesnt fail you are still getting beat on, even though you didnt cast any dots and there are no spell casters casting on you. <BR>The availablity of weapon and armor quests are very low. paladins can quest or do easy camps for their weapons, . i happen to thing that camping the gb in upper guk is a lot easier then caming cav in lguk. <P>becuase of the tpe f hybrid that we are, we should get a increse in defencive and offencive skills. not as high as a warrior just maybe a few points below it. like 10 or 15. also the skill disarm is totally usless to us. it caps out at a low level so it never works. it worked once on a orc pawn but that was it. take it out and give us an offencive skill.  also the use of ht needs to be checked out. ht to a lv 40+ mob doesnt even take out 1/20 of their health.  you cant even use ht to kill the mob as it is running away to stop trains at this level. the damage output needs to be incresed in this area also.<P><BR>Fylenn Bloodseeker, slayer of the damned. of the bertoxx server. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Okies, I think SK's are close ot being "there." I do like the idea of having a weapon specialistation.  I can see the logic of why this would work from both a role play and game balance side.  <P>For rp reasons, this would work because I believe that SK's and Paladins are basically "Knights" and "Unholy Knights" that are granted spells based upon the following of thier gods/goddesses.  Well, I am avid fantasy reader and aside from the spells granted, the other thing that seperated knights from brigands and warriors was specialistation. Most specialzed in lances and mounted combat.  As this is not possible in game, it makes sense we could devote our skills to a single weapon of our choice and learn that at an adjusted level.  <P>Why this would work in the game is that it would improve the melee abilities in a particular weapon (thus sk's/paladins would gain a little more offense) and would limit us as we still would not be as porwerful at warriors.  Along this same thought process, by doing this, lets say someone specialized in a two handed capacity found a mace, well, while they can use it they will not be as effective.  <P>You could even make this a quest so people would have to follow the "vision" of the game and quest/group.  <P>I think as a whole that this is a great game and has provided me with hours of fun.  FOr that, I thank you.  But I am kind of baffled why you claim that this game is about grouping and yet we are constantly (sk's) passed over for groups. At upper levels it is HARD to find groups as we dont have the skills that make us as effective as other classes.  I am not nor would I ever say we should be equal to warriors, or do the same damage, but if we were on more of a level playing field we would be more group friendly.<P>If we could taunt/attack more effectively then we would not have to struggle for groups.<P>Thanks for your time, and thank you for a great game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I absolutely love many of the things Verant has done in the past; and especially recently, to improve Shadowknights. However, I believe there is still more that can be done to achieve that delicate balance among tank classes. In addition to the other excellent ideas already posted, I'd propose the following:<P>1) Although the proposed mini-Augment Death is a nice addition, the real problem is that our pets are TOTALLY useless. My pet rarely hits mobs I'm fighting (even high greens) and when it does, it does minimal/negligible damage. I would suggest increasing the strength of our pets. For example, instead of the SK level 39 pet being level 19-21, make it level 24-26.<P>2) Increase the caps on our disarm and hide skills. They are currently so low as to be totally useless.<P>3) Give us a poison based DOT at level 9 that uses Abjuration (maybe replacing sense  the dead). This is more in line with the vision of a Shadow Knight. It also gives us a useful spell to improve our Abjuration (which FD is based on). Endure cold is a waste just to improve abjuration.<P>4) Our spells based on Evocation (all DD spells) do so little damage at the level the spell is attained that it is always better to just melee the mob. Furthermore, we don't get the first Evo spell till level 22 which is only effective against undead. Please either increase the power of these spells or give them to us earlier, or replace them with something more useful. My evocation skill is sitting at 35 or so because it is a waste of time improving it.<P>5) Would you consider allowing us to invis others as well as ourselves (regular invis). This would, at lower levels, give us another reason to be needed in a group.<P>6) It would be nice to have our channeling skill increased since we are more likely to be hit during casting.<P>7) Also, since our mana pool was increased not too long ago, it would be logical to have an increase in our meditation skill to compensate.<P>8) Finally, the casting time (reduce interrupts) or recast time (more opportunity to get it off) on FD for SK's needs to be reduced. We use FD to escape and it is usually when we are low on HP's. We have to contend with interrupts, fizzles, and mobs saving against it. If it doesn't succeed the first or second attempt casting, we are usually dead shortly after.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Personally i think the role of shadowknight needs to be altered a bit.  We should be one of the most offensive classes in the game but the cost of which is our defense isnt quite that great.  Every class must have a drawback.  However, as i'm sure you can read in all of the previous posts, we are not terribly offensive at times.<P>As far as melee goes, it is quite apparent that several classes out damage us... rogues, warriors, monks, and well, frankly i think we can beat some of the casters in close combat (provided they arent armed). Our defense, like i said earlier, should be a drawback... we have to face it that we cannot wade into combat and assume to be equal to a warrior class.  Part of the drawback of the warrior is that he gets to push that little button "attack" throughout the whole game and every once in a while push "kick".  Think about that and its nice to know we have options.<P>The options, however, seem to be bit misguided.  I dont know about everyone else but I think we all agree the SK should be the epitome of fear and evil, an agent of "death" if you will.  And while i like some of the spells i have i think the whole system is a bit wrong...<P>Basically we have been the combination of warrior and necromancer, but our necromancer skills were just made wrong from the start.  What i am proposing will of course upset the nature of the class now... but maybe in the future it would be  a nice improvement.  I think that to give the sk skills of necromancer levels and level below our current level is sort of absurd.  Many posts complain that why should i bother casting a spell when i can just smack em with my sword for 4 times of the damage of that lifespike?  agreed. <P>There are many instances that casting spells are simply not convenient or possible.  Our pets simply do not have the hp to allow us to step back, take a breather and cast fear for example.  And once the pet falls, we know we basically are not casting again until the monster or I am dead.  But I for one am not saying make our pets stronger, i'm saying let us cast differently. Basically there are various areas of the necromantic spellbook which are completely appropriate for SK's at the level they are at (i.e. for some spells the necromancer and the sk should get them at the same time).<P>Mind blowing i know... but i do not see the Sk as a wizard that casts dd and dot's.  The SK should siphon strength, debuff, fear, etc.  But spells like poison bolt and clinging darkness should not be in the realm of the SK.  There are many necromatic spells that make more sense for the SK earlier.  Please follow along with my ramblings:<P>Shieldskin at lvl 39!  What the heck does 55hp do for you at lvl 39?  That is less that one attack from ANYTHING you are meleeing with at that level.<P>Banshee Aura at 54!  That ancient wurm with 32k hp is not falling any faster because i am hitting it for an extra 6 damage per attack.<P>In short,  Sk should have the ability to buff before the battle with better spells.  I liked the idea that we should be able to apply poison but not make it.  And perhaps we could have a line of "weapon" spells that would proc various effects during the battle... like a diseased blade, a poison blade, a mana draining blade, a fear blade.  It would make more sense if the SK abilities were taliored more towards COMBAT and not make him a lvl 16 necromancer at lvl 54.  These abilites do no good.<P>Finally, why doesnt the SK have intimidation?  Frankly i would find any SK of any class more intimidating than a halfling rogue (no offense to the bilbo's of the world) : ) </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055531-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055531-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055531-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055531-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055531-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055531-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055531&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055531&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
