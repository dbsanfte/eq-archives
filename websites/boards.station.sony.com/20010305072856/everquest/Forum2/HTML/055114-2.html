</FONT><HR>Poisons: I'd like to see poison get charges. I've heard it couldn't be done, but since I think there must be a way to do it, I'm going for it.<BR>Actually, maybe make it in 2 steps: Step one, you combine poison components and get an unsealed XXX type of poison wich IS stackable; Step two, you combine a XXX unsealed vial of poison and get the actual poison vial wich does not stack. So basically, we would only need to bring stacks of XXX type of unsealed poison vials and stacks of seals. Not sure if this can be done, but that's an alternative to the charged poison vials.<P>Instill doubt: Something needs to be done about the check failing when the backstab button is greyed out.<P>Sneak and hide: It should NOT wears off while zoning. From a roleplaying standpoint, there shouldn't be 'zones' anyways and the caster's invis doesn't wear off while zoning.<P>Backstab: A dmg bonus on 'frontstab' could be nice. Maybe make it so it does the min dmg backstab for your actual lvl. That would just helps soloing a little since I'd better take a shot at a full backstab then a min dmg stab in a group situation.<P>Track: Since the EQ rogue concept is now more like assassin, a somewhat low track skill sounds logical. Though something like rogues could only track two legged humanoids (or even only players) maybe only in cities/dungeons..<P>Throwing weapons: We get critical hits and deadly strikes with them but why don't we get some higher dmg/range ones? I mean actually, I'd rather pull with a bow.. Well, the ability to apply poison on throwing/ranged weapons would be nice, but I see where it becomes unbalanced: running around with 1 stack of poisoned arrows in range slot. That is unless applying poison on ammo would get back an unstackable poisoned arrow for exemple.<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>So you're going to nerf the one skill that keeps the rogue with his caster-like hit points from getting smacked to pieces?  Maybe it's too effective when it works (it does fail, you know!), but I hope it's not nerfed to the point that rogues become like Rangers, unable to use their supposed superior offense skills.<P>Still waiting for final balancing to figure out which melee to level up...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Rogues are fine.  I started a rogue back in the day when poisons weren't implemented and Pick locks did little to nothing.  Some of my Backstabs  did all of 7 points of damage.  I had to stop playing some for a bit for the simple fact that most groups feared us for the pickpocket skill and that we were really useless mana sinks.  This all has been fixed and Kudos to Verant for doing this and making my life fun again.  I don't have any problem finding groups anymore, and most people I know are aware that a Tank/rogue combonation is much more effective than a Tank/Tank combonation.  The pick pocket skill could be worked on, but I am not gonna complain if it isn't.  Poison is a Blast and I actually get invites on raids for my picklock skill.  I guess that a rogue may be slightly damage heavy in higher levels, but this is counteracted by the fact that IT only happens in a group.  Still no such thing as a soloing rogue.  The only thing I wish rogues had that they don't is forage.  I don't see where this would make them more powerfull really, and it would give me more access to poisons.  But then again, if I am gonna be that picky, I might as well go start a ranger and have him do the collecting for me.<P>Thank you for your time.<P>.KOS</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Soul-bound Lockpicks.<P>A quest reward maybe, a set of lockpicks that are soul bound, so we dont have to keep 4 sets in the bank for when we die in Howling Stones or the crypt in Sebilis.<P>More weapons.<P>Right now rogues have it pretty good on weapons, and it's a twink's candy store.  However there are some HUGE gaps between certain levels of weapons.  At the endgame, it is impractical for a rogue NOT to have their epic weapon, since it is so hugely effective compaired to their alternatives (not counting Necropolis weapons).  How many rogues out there, at around level 51, gave up their Trak Tooth (10/20) for a Ragebringer?  Most, I'd say, unless they had a Bloodpoint.  With each expansion, a rogue's options become broader, but as a class that relies on its damage dealing capacity, we will always be limited here.<P>Hide/Sneak<P>This should hold over while zoning or logging in.  Especially in Velious, where there are unsafe zone ins, and when I am half dead before my comp catches up with the server (think: Skyshrine), hiding/sneaking upon entry isnt an option.<P>Masks of Deception, Obtenebration, and Iksar Hide.<P>Our three illusion masks, every rogue wants more, they make the class fun, and a little bit more rogue-like.  However, I want to point out that you can NOT click to remove these illusions, if you want to remove it, you either have to zone, die, or wait for the 90 minutes to come up.  Can it be changed so we can click them off?<P>Assassin's Armor.<P>The armor from the Plane of Growth.  I have to ask, was it made to look garish as an offset for its good stats?  Very few races look good in it, and none look at all like a rogue or an assassin in it.  Unless we are going undercover to kill the Circus Ringmaster.  My opinion is it should look like Gnome Skin armor, but hey, I could be the only one who doesnt like looking like a clown..<P>Anyway, thats about it for me.<P>Ullric Littleblade<BR>Barbarian Rogue, 53<BR>Ayonae Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Let me first start off with "If it isnt broken dont fix it".  If your guessing I am talking about EVADE your right.  Its bad enough as a rogue that our damage is so high the argo we get is enormous.  Much more then a warrior or any other meele could ever think possible.  I would even go as far as to say you could compare us to wizards in that department.  While what you suggest for evade would be fine in group of 6 where the battle spam and the lag isnt bad at all.  But when in large groups fighting NPCs that quad from 400 to 850 or more.  What you porpose is enough of a feature to get me to complain.  As it is now you have to time it just right to get one evade and pray it doesnt fail.  But if you only take us down a notch we will end up being dead faster then a ranger fighting a spiderling in misty thicket.  <P>You have done alot of good things that have made the rogue a beautiful class to play.  You probably wont recieve too many people saying that we arent pretty much fine the way we are.  But OMG please dont mess with evade.  You'll end up bugging it and then we will have to wait for weeks before we know that the nerf you propose will only be depressing at best and we will get to make a hot key that says "ready for res".  A rogue isnt suppose to consentrate on AC and we dont have the HPs to tank in most cases.  Are only claim to being different in combat is being able to Backstab and we can barely find the back side in a large gather as it is.  But if you make us have to constantly hit evade like someone would hit the turbo button in a shooter game then your going disappoint if not drive off many people that play the class already.  That would also mean we would get less chances to actually BS in the game.  I dont enjoy looking at a mobs tail for 99% of the time I play but I enjoy it more then being neeked at my bind point for 99% of the game.<P>On to the other only thing I think you need to look at from a rogues point of view.  You revamped the poison skill.  Now revamp the stacking of such poisons.  Make it allow us to carry it around much like a shaman would carry around 10 charge sow potions.  Right now we dont have enough room to carry single charge poisons for the amout of different effect we can do.  I dont see any reason why we can get our poisons to be able to be 10 charge viels.  <P>Sorry just thought of two more peeves/fixes...  At level 60 we are suppose to be able to assassinate.  Please lift the designation on what we can and cant assassnate.  Not the level requirement of the PC but the make up.  Right now its just humaniond mobs.  I dont see why I cant assassinate a giant or an undead creature if it meets the level requirments.<P>Maybe a look into the disciplines also.  I wouldnt mind seeing some being longer duration or less time till you can use it again.  I nothing gets me madder to hit nimble disc and see after I have died and im neeked at my bind to "you bounce around nimble".  If I hit my disc it should not apply unless im actually alive with it goes off.<P><BR>Brionca Doublemint<BR>The Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Rogues are pretty much doing their job in the high level game these days.  They do some extra damage from behind but are crappy tanks (losing the extra damage and having low hp/ac).  Having said that there are still a few areas in which rogues need work.<P>1) Rogues are the masters of stealth but in many places invis is superior to sneaking.  This situtation has been made even more pronounced with the HUGE amount of classes that can invis now. Remember some classes can already do what I am asking for with invis by lev 4-8.<P>a) Make sneak work across zoning and when a rogue goes LD.<BR>b) Allow rogues to sneak while underwater.<BR>c) Lev 60 for full spd sneaking is ridiculous (Invis classes at full spd by lev 4-8).  I suggest ramping sneak spd to full from levs 40-50 rather than 51-60.<P>2) Poison is still an extremely unbalanced and unused ability.  The time/cost/inventory space needed for even 1 use of this skill is totally out of whack.  Even with the ingredients poison takes too long to apply for the affect.  Why would I take 7+ seconds out of a fight to apply a poison (that can fail) when I do more damage if I stay in combat.<P>a) Make it so that apply poison is automatic...but as the skill approces 100 the apply goes down to 3 sec.<BR>b) A successful apply at 101-250 skill should have a chance at not using up the poison.  Maybe avrg 3 uses from a poison at 200 skill...4-5 at 250.<BR>c) Apply poison should use the same animation as bind wound...crouch and auto standup when you are done rather than remain sitting.<P>3) Allow warriors and rogues to cap bind wounds at 200 before lev 60.  They should get the benefits of 200+ bind woulds at 51 rather than at lev 60.  These 2 classes are the worse when no healer is around and I mean by too far a margin.<P>4) Instill doubt works 1 in 5-6 tries against a mob 12 levs below me at 200 max skill.  How bout increase the success by 10% or so.<P>Thx for youe time.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Safefall - Pardon my asking but what the idea behind caping this at 94?  I certainly feel that monks and rogues should have the ability to see the benefits of this skill beyond this number, and how about this for a thought....why not give safe fall a inherent chance like the assasin discipline to actually prevent complete death when falling over a height so great as to otherwise immediately kill you.  I think that the chance of still dying would be enough to deter people from taking the chance on purpose just to decend from great heights, but it sure would be handy for when you accidently walk over the incredibly well disguised chasam near Kiel in Velious or other heights you might not have otherwise run across on purpose.  Maybe a successful use of this "emergency" kick in of safe fall could be some serious stat penalty like you get when rezed.  Maybe you cant move or use any skills for 5 minutes and can only lay helpless on the ground (as if your legs were just crushed).  <P>Disarm -  Do we actually need to talk about this?  This is the most rediculous skill in our reprotire.  We wait until 30 to get it and after receiving it get nothing else to play with until disciplines kick in in the low 50's.  Is this really supposed to do what it does, because its far from useful and even further from satisfying my appetite for something to work towards since we get no skills after it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There's a small list that (IMO) would make the rogue better, especially in the light that evade is going to be nerfed. I'll get into the points after one small comment on that.<P>Rogues will be dying a lot more because of this proposed evade change, plus we will now be more of a drain on healers from the extra damage we will take. This could reduce our usefulness in groups, as one of our current advantages is that we don't require a lot of mana spent on us. I'd be very careful implementing this change. There could be far reaching consequences for high-end rogues when this goes in. Remember that pre-evade, rogues were considered liabilities in groups because they needed excessive healing (if they lived) when a mob got on them.<P>Also, the entire point of evade was to NOT have rogues have to keep backing out of combats. I guess if evade just dropped us to the bottom of the list in terms of attackers (we're still hated more than someone across the zone), that may not be as bad, but I fear the worst.<P>Enough on that. Here are some suggestions:<P>1. Some form of escape. How about rogue-only spirit of scale boots? Make a nice quest out of it, and give us some way to get the heck out of bad situations. We're one of the only classes that doesn't have some method of escaping from danger (i.e. feign, high HP, teleport, SoW, etc.). Scale doesn't stay if you attack, so it's purely a form of travel and escape. I'd love to see another BR-type quest for a pair of cool travel boots. Jboots doesn't feel like a rogue-type quest at all. Besides, unless you're in a group or very high level for the AC, a rogue isn't soloing it.<P>2. Sneak / Hide to work over logout / zoning / LD<P>3. Some small benefit to help us get in groups. It is still difficult to find groups with a Rogue, and you spend hours sometimes running from zone to zone (the boots would help there) just trying to find one. Having to spend time trying to find a place to have "fun" isn't fun. I would suggest a money bonus for looting mobs when a rogue is in the group -- say 20%. Actually, the rogue should just always find more money on mobs. What are those coins in our logo for, anyway? =)<P>4. Improve throwing skill. Why aren't there any good throwing weapons? Most throwing weapons have ranges 60 and under, where a bow can shoot 200. If this is to be a defining skill for the rogue (why have deadly strikes and crits with them if not?), then please give us some better items to use with it. Heck, the damage isn't as important most of the time as the range.<P>5. Make Ravenscale no-drop or quest based. The only class armor that is truly farmable by other classes(and usually is). Minor, but this really is THE rogue armor until Woven Shadow in Hate, and that's a long level stretch for one set of armor, especially if you can't get it.<P>That's about it, IMO.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>From the viewpoint of a level 30 Rogue, who has also done quite a bit of reading and studying most classes, I believe that Rogues are balanced right now, verging on overpowered at the higher levels. Only a few things I would suggest:<P>1) Assassin's Armor: Disco isn't very stealthy, please change the look/tint.<P>2) Sneak/Hide: I don't care much about changes any other way, but it would be nice if Sneak and Hide would stay up if you go LD.<P>3) Poison: Right now, all I use them for is fighting tough greens that I'm seeking revenge on. (Ambassador D'vinn and Kizdean Gix, anyone?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif">) I don't really see much of a problem with that, as I only currently use the low end poisons (Snake and Asp). However, it would be nice if we could combine them, similar to Shamen Potions, just to save some space.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sneak -  Please give Sneak a reason for being.  Who is actually going to go anyplace just sneaking w/o hiding.  If the point was to have a skill that makes a rogue invisible you could have just made a skill called invisable and saved us all a spot on our hotkeys interface (which by the way need to be bigger than 10 buttons w/o having to use shift+2,3,4 etc). My suggestion would be to ramp up the speed at which a rouge can sneak as the skill progresses.  Certainly you can remember all the times that you tried to sneak around as a kid...the more you did it the faster you could get from point A to B...certainly a reason to raise sneak past 80 skill would be a good thing.<P>Rogue Epic -  My god some of the epic weapons look cool...and have you seen some of the GM event rewards?  Dang these things are cool...so what in the heck reason could you ever have for not handing out a rogue epic that is one of the sweetest looking pieces of hardware that can be wielded?  Make poision drip off the blade..or blood run down it or something...but my god make it look cool.  And for that matter make the rogue armour look cool too.<P>SO, the big money question is: Is the rogue balanced.  In my opinion, I would not stop playin my rogue today even if none of the suggestions in any of these posts were ever implemented...<P>The Rogue IS balanced...but polish and balance are not the same and most of the suggestions are about polish and not balance.<BR>  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>More on Backstab...... In D&D, it was acceptable for thieves to "backthwack" using staff/blunt weapons.  The idea being that a backstab is not literally a stab, but more of a precision strike to a portion of the body.  Namely the back or vital organs.  Maybe taking a look at the different weapon types and allowing "backstabs" with other types, such as blunt weapons would not be such a bad thing.<P>But, I still find it hard to believe that a rogue backstabs dragons and monsters with no "backs".</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>i do not agree with the evade thing. in fact, evade is one of the few things i think rogues need improved. at my current lvl (48) if there is not a warrior in the group, i can barely backstab. If i backstab early or often in a fight, the mob will aggro on me to the point that the paladins or monks or SK's or whatever we have as a tank cannot taunt it off me unless i stop attacking for a couple rounds AND have a successful evade. if i just evade and then start attacking again, i'll re-draw aggro immeadiately and take a beating until im able to get a successfull evade in again.<P>while it is true that with a warrior in the group i have full control over which direction the mob is pointing, all too often it ends up being me, a healer, two or three paladins, and a monk in the group, and i have 2 choices. The first choice being to not backstab untill the mob is at 30% health to avoid aggro. The second choice being to play my rog to the fullest and backstab every chance given. This of course draws full aggro and even after an evade, as soon as i start attacking again, the mob will turn back on me. The paladins and monk dont do enough damage or taunt well enough to pull the mob off me. I'll become an HP pit for the healer and increase downtime while the healer meds. I dont like either of these situations, because i either feel like im holding back, or else i end up tanking (which i am in no way qualified to do). Other ways i have tried to avoid tanking is by equiping crap weapons, which works, but then again i feel like i am holding back.<P>another complaint on the evade is its success rate. Using log parsers, i pierce for 60%, i slash for 60% and i backstab for 60%. I evade for 28%. This quoted 'success' rate includes the many times i 'succeed' but the mob still whacks on me or immeadiately returns aggro on me.<P>WITH a warrior in the group, rogs are great. we can dish out a lot of damage while requiring few heals. Without a warrior, rogs simply turn into mana pits. We have a huge taunt factor, and cant tank much better than a caster. I'm not asking for better tanking abilities because im an 'offensive rogue', not a 'defensive rogue'. What i am asking, is rather than 'nerf' the evade, please make it better!<P>--<BR>Kether, 48 rog on Torv</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Not Death, Not Zoning, Never tried Checking it after Camping, but I am pretty sure not camping, not even the almighty Lag beast helps this one, I see no reason for hide/sneak to pop up.<P>On the Evade, So what you are saying is we will pop down the list under the Tanks, but not under people halfway across the zone?  I can live with that.  I hope.  When it Works, and if it does not wind up Broken as intended like half the Bard songs.<P>One item of Note.  Is it really your intention to have Rogues do more damage than Monks?  More than Warriors I can understand, Not like I am being silly and standing Toe to Toe, I am stabbing them in the back, a much more historicly effective method.  Monks on the other hand have little to offer other than Damage and pulling.<P>Other than that, the convienence issues of Poison are all I see that needs looked at.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I actually asked the rogues of the Safehouse for their opinions on this, and here's the long list of possible things we've come up with (note that these are not all viable options, and are not listed in any particular order, but from a large group a rogues gathering ideas, this is what at least some of us would like to see done with the rogue class):<P>POISON<BR> A) Make more affordable (vials, etc).  With most success rates, mastering poison can costs thousands of plat, even assuming you kill hordes of green creatures for components and make your own vials with pottery.  Possibly improve the drop rate on components.  Possibly even make the suspensions brewable to reduce the cost on that end.<BR> B) Stackable poisons.  Something similar to the shaman alchemical potion bag would be nice, possibly even quest for it, but carrying a backpack that will only hold 8 poisons is kinda hard.  Or even, instead of charged poisons, something similar to alcohol where the number of vials in the stack is shown as the lil' number on the icon (each vial in the stack still being just one charge).  However it can be changed, that is one of the primary requests of almost every rogue spoken to (even though we've been told before that it is impossible with the currect code, it's still something we're asking for).<BR> C) Change to a short-term random proc of the poison instead of a 1-shot use on first attack, similar to the poisons received when fighting Snakes or Spiders.  It's not likely that all the poison comes off the blade, on the very first hit of combat. If it proc'd then it would also not go off on the very first hit. But, say, proc up to X amount of times randomly before you zone. I can see how some would get the impression that on the higher DD poisons this could be very over damaging, but think this is all by chance. You have just as much chance as it going off on the mob you really want to have it go off on, or it could proc all X amount of times on the very mob you don't want it to proc on<BR> D) Allow poisoning range slot weapons.  'Nuff said there.<BR> E) Make applications always succeed, and base the apply time on the Apply Poison skill.<BR> F) Create a line of poisons that are drinkable, rather than applied on the weapon -- some nasty effect on the wielder rather than on the opponent.  Classic ideas of this sort can even be found back in Shakespeare -- the poison Juliet drank to feign death for a day, anyone?<BR> G) Work a bit more on the resists against poison -- it can be rather annoying to spend a minimum of 2pp on to upwards of 15pp, assuming we succeed on the first try at making the poison, only to have it resisted when we try to use it.<P>EVADE (big request)<BR>Allow Evade to work while moving.  The bug where if you are moving or getting hit while trying to evade, and getting the message "You must be perfectly still to hide!" should be fixed. This is very important. Perhaps when a mob is beating on you, you couldn't very well just dissapear while he is making contact to you, but, it does not make sense for you to have to be still to have to duck away from the combat. Evade should work better on higher level encounters too. Countless times have I evaded successfully with many high level taunters there, and the mob just won't get off me.<P>SEE INVIS<BR> A) Should not work on hidden rogues.  We are hiding in shadows, not invisible, which is why hide works on both live and undead creatures at the same time.  Give casters a See Shadows spell to see rogues, but stop letting See Invis work.<BR> B) We are not hiding on accord of magic, it is all skill. See invis is to detect people invisible to the naked eye by magic. No see shadows spell, because no magic should be able to see a camoflauged rogue.<P>GENERAL OFFENSIVE/DEFENSIVE<BR> A) Offense is just fine.  Rogues are the masters of melee damage, and should stay that way.<BR> B) Defense has a few things that can work out with it, mostly dealing with the evade skill (see below).<BR> C) I think rogue riposte and parry skills should be slightly increased.  I know rogues combat-wise are already excellent, but we should be able to avoid damage a little better. Sure, if hit, it should (and does) hurt a TON, but we should be able to avoid it more.<P>CURRENT SKILLS<BR> A) Instill Doubt:  works very rarely, even at 200+ skill levels.  Also, fix problem of backstab not working immediately after an ID, but the button not being greyed out -- either grey out the backstab button when ID is used, or allow backstabs immediately after a successful ID.<BR> B) Disarm:  works very rarely, even at 200+ skill levels.<BR> C) Swimming:  I'd like to see the amount of time we can stay underwater doubled. I think this is definately in-character for a rogue; this applies for monks also.<BR> D) Safe Fall:  Let us master Safefall. Heck, raise the cap to 200. Who do you see jumping off a three story building and not taking any damage? A cat-burgler or a Tibetian monk ?  It hardcaps at what, 94? Thats level 19? You think I'd learn something new in 40 levels.<BR> E) Sense/Disarm Traps:  Have more traps removeable at a higher skill than 100 or even sense them at a higher level than 100. Bards are able to remove most if not all the traps out there.  Rogues have a higher skill cap than a bard for a reason.  Lets use it and make it more viable.  Also, possibly have the skill checks for sense/disarm traps work differently -- more of a chance to sense or disarm a trap, perhaps, instead of always succeeding once skills hit a certain number (i.e. A person with a 1 in Sense and/or Disarm Traps could potentially find and remove a very hard trap, but only as much as a pink snowball could potentially win a lawsuit against Microsoft for adding air conditioning to Hell.)<BR> F1) Throwing:  Rogues are supposed to be masters of throwing -- we even have crits and deadly strikes with throwing weapons already.  But many rogues still use bows simply due to the greatly increased damages and ranges over throwing weapons.  Perhaps make range and/or damage of thrown weapons increase with level?<BR> F2) Throwing:  Reduce or eliminate the lower range limit on thrown weapons -- the majority of thrown weapons can still be used in close quarters or melee range, just not very effectively ;-)<BR> F3) Throwing:  Bolo Snare! Tangle up their feet some with a throwing weapon.  Or returning throwing weapons (boomerang, chakram, etc).  This goes along with the idea of a wider range of possible throwing items, manufactured (smithed daggers, fletched darts, etc), dropped, or bought.<BR> F4) Throwing to be good for something, perhaps adding level damage bonus to it - or making the throwing weapons themselves have no damage code, and the damage is completely determined by your throwing skill. I'd like to see Archery and Throwing become two different animals.<BR> G) Evade:  Change Evade so in PvP, a successful Evade removes the rogue's name from the opponents' target window.<BR> H) Assassinate:  Increase the damage on assassinate. There are mobs that get "assassinated" but do NOT die, primarily in Velious where many mobs even below level 48 have over 32000hp. Fix this so that the damage on it will *assassinate* these mobs.<BR> I) Sneak/Hide: Change this to not break while zoning, similar to invis, or doesn't break when linkdead or logging out or in.<BR> J1) Pick Pockets:  Perhaps raise the level restriction on pickpocketable mobs?  Just an idea.<BR> J2) Pick Pockets:  Allow pick-pocketting other players in a PvP environment.<BR> K1) Backstab:  Add a small chance for a backstab to stun a mob or knockback just a bit to break casting.<BR> K2) Backstab:  Possibly add a potential for a frontstab (backstab from the front which results in a normal pierce) to do a small additional damage or possibly have a stun component instead of the backstab from the back.<BR> K3) Backstab:  Minor point, but some rogues would like a different animation for backstabs instead of the normal piercing animation.<BR> K4) Backstab:  Yet another option, allow rogues to backstab mobs with 1hb weapons, for no damage but for a nice stun effect, as a sap or blackjack would be used to knock someone out before robbing them blind.<P>POTENTIAL NEW SKILLS<BR> A) Taunt:  I see no reason for rogues not to get Taunt. Yeah, I probably wouldn't always have it on a hotkey, but it'd be nice to have it when I need it. And who can't cuss out a mob like a rogue? I just don't see a paladin having better insults than our class.  ;-)  Then again, some rogues want it, some don't -- but if we all had it, the ones that didn't want it could just not use it.  *shrug*<BR> B) Tracking/Stalking:  Player-only tracking, following the "stalker" or "assassin" aspects of rogues.<BR> C) Foraging/Herbalism:  Potential to forage for poison components in areas where those components are normally dropped by mobs.<BR> D) Kick: Let it cap at 50. This would help Instill Doubt work more effectively.<BR> E1) Discipline: Sprint. Duration 10 seconds. Recycle 35 mins. Effect: Speed increase between SoW and SoC. At the end of the duration it completely drains your stamina. However, during the duration STA is buffed to 200 and encumberance is not factored in to movement. I'd like to see this around 20 - 35. If sneaking this would break sneak.<BR> E2) Additional idea to the above discipline, one that probably will only be liked by the more evil character-types.  Same discipline as above, except when activated, causes a snare-type effect on a random party member.  One of the easiest ways to outrun a bear is to hit your buddy in the knees first.<BR> F) Discipline: Undetectable.  Duration 10-15 seconds.  Recycle 30 minutes.  Basically, a sneak/hide that CANNOT/WILL NOT ever be broken or seen through, a la GM-Invis.  Loot body, don't see me. Trip a trap, don't break it. Mob normally sees thru sneak hide, no way possible to see thru that discipline.<BR> G) Sneak a ride on a taxi! Covertly hitch a ride with your favorite Druid or Wizard. They open a portal, you sneak through. A failure would result in you being left behind, a critical failure would get you deposited in Detroit.<P>EQUIPMENT and QUESTS<BR> A) Long, hard, and involved quest, possibly from Temple of Solusek Ro, for soulbound lockpicks.<BR> B) Long quests, or low-level possibly for High Elf mask (hinted at during the Ragebringer epic) or possibly Wood Elf/Half Elf masks.  Currently this would help Barbarian and Dark Elf rogues -- Barbarians with the choice of being big and blind or small and evil, and Dark Elves with no way to pretend to be good until getting a rather high-level Kunark mask (Erudite).<BR> C) Epic Quest:  Require the Burning Rapier to be turned in during the quest instead of being able to skip that step.<BR> D) Epic Quest:  Many rogues are rather dissatisfied with the very small, very hard-to-see particle effect on the Ragebringer.<BR> E) Dyed chain would be nice since rogues can't wear plate.  ;-)<BR> F) Potential for a quest for a piece of armour that summons throwing weapons, other than the Mrylokar Bracer, as a potential way to increase the viability of throwing.<BR> G) Assassin's armour:  I've seen some myself, and either the name needs to be changed or the look needs to change -- "assassins" don't need to be running around in banana suits and standing out like a house on fire during a blackout.<BR> H) Possibility of translucent armour, similar to the look of shadowmen?<BR> I) Possibility of rogue-only quests in Plane of Mischief?  I know the zone isn't quite complete yet last I checked, but please make sure there's at least some rogue quests in the plane of the god of most rogues -- with the possibility of a quest for non-Bristlebane-worshipping rogues to enable getting the other rogue quests in the plane.<BR> J) Keeping with the whole idea that we can have other class' abilities in the form of items, a high-level quest resulting in SoW boots that WORK INDOORS ONLY. We're dungeoncrawlers, not druids, so it's only SoW in concept. Spirit of the Rat sounds better. It's an item, not a skill, it shouldn't piss anyone off, but it probably will.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am so glad this message board was finally started.  Ok some of my points were addressed above but I will reiterate a few.<P>STACKABLE POISONS.<BR>I dont know why verant doesn't allow stackable poisons.  We are the only ones that can use it.  It makes it so hard to to practice the skill on the fly when you succeed you will take up valuable space in your inventory.  i would use poison alot more if they were stackable and i could carry 10 to 20 at a time without having to have 4 -5 bags just with poisons.  i travel alot and dont make it to cities but ever 5 - 6 days this would help adventurers like me.  I know I could carry the ingredients which are stackable and the moltar and make it everytime but come one if I wnat to have a range of poisons i.e. speed reducer, DoT, DD, or debuffer do u realize haw many ingredients i would need and how many different vials and suspensions. just wondering<P>COST<BR>Poison are so expensive even the low level ones.  I wish they could be a little lower orsome container that are very expensive but reusable.  maybe with charges who knows.  I think since we have to search all over norrath and some fall off low level mobs that that should be a far trade off.<P>PICKPOCKET<BR>I would like to know what was Verants initial policy and reason for puttin this in the game.  I personally think this is a rogue skill and without it we are just a regular class with no real roleplaying capability.  Pick locks, pickpocket, hide+sneak these are classic rogue skills.  I hear alot of ppl gettin reprimanded by guides and GM's for stealing from mobs.  Yes it is bad form and hurts all rogues reputation but most mobs tell the group and we cant pick animals so actually are range for mobs we can pick undetected is kinda slim (Kinda...lol).  If we are not allowed to pick in a group and we cant solo past teams to pick our own kills then why do we have quest that we have to Pickpocket NPC's.  How does Verant suggest we keep our skills high enough to do these quest.  My skill is at 190 and I was "reprimanded" by a guide for practicing pickpocket on mobs and guards that I had no intention on killing. Someone said I was taking from their loot even because they were not camped yet but would be soon.  please any reply would be appreciated.<P>DISARM<BR>I agree with above..increase our range for items we can disarm but have it drop in the inventory..because at higher lvls I cant help the group by disarm a mob with a magic weapon.  that may be considered over powering the mob but hey it does hurt to wish<P>SNEAK<BR>I think the lvl that we are able to increase our movement at sneak should be lowered because from lvl 1 to 30 we get a new skill ever couple levels, theres something to strive for then from lvl 30 to 40 we have nothing and from lvl 40 to 51 i believe.  Plus since we get sneak at such a low level it would be only right in a roleplaying aspect that by time we reach 45 would be some skilled in sneaking that we could do it better and at a faster pace.  hey maybe you can make it that when you reach 200 or 225 skill you get better.  <P>I think thats it..I love the rogue class and think we are fairly well balanced overall.<P>Also for my wish list I know we have like 3 mask we can get as rogues but to have a couple more would be cool.  After all one thing verant missed is that a rogue is a master at blending in and disguise.  Maybe you could have one for a small race and a large race or make it so you have a large mask so that a barbarian can look like a ogre or troll, one for small races so a dwarf can look like a gnome or halfling..etc.  they could be results of a well thought out quest.  i know that it would seem like we were crossing over to enchanters territory but make it so thes mask have no faction changes ..I dont just thought of it havent had a chance to think it through...<P>Ok this is kinda long so I'll go for now ..I hope you are able to answer my questions.  Thanks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well couple things that would be nice additions to the class.<P>Better Throwing weapons. These 50range throwing weapons just don't give us that much at all. You give us the Criticals and Deadly Strikes but with the current crappy selection for majority of rogues for throwing weapons most of them use arrows for the range and variety. The Bracer of Hammerfell is a nice item BUT rogues can't use it or the hammers it summons.<P>Stunning Backstabs. Maybe I'm off base here but if your spine is being peirced for 300+ damage wouldn't your mind falter a tad? Maybe give backstabs for 300 plus or something a 10% chance of stunning the mob as well.<P>Disarm. I recently went to work on my pick pocket skill (as it was rather low at 110ish). I went and found me a nice lil orc legionare in West Commons and while getting my Pick Pocket up I was using Disarm also. It took me twenty four (24!!) attempts at disarming to get that lame rusty long sword out of his hands (with 199 disarm). Like thats going to be of any use at all to anyone.<P>Instill Doubt. It is my understanding that Instil Doubt has 3 checks as to wether it succeds or not. 1 for skill to see if it even goes off. Second for the kick which kicks against the mobs AC rating. Third for the Fear Spell checking against the mobs MR. With 3 skill checks no wonder it works 1 outta 10 attempts (if that). Why not if you get the skill check for the Skill you auto land the kick? would still leave the fear check there but would help a good amount I think with its succes rate.<P>Weapon Selection. With Veilous and Kunark some weapons have just become not so great. Look at the Spear from Hate. You can aquire a weapon with same dam/delay from Crystilline Caves, Crystal Grinder, for round 500ish pp. The rapier from Fear 10/24. Most level 35 rogues have a weapon that good, Slime Coated Harpoon. Yet we have to wait till 46 to get those two weapons? Maybe have a revision of the dam/delay on those two weapons. The stats on them are nice additions and the spears range ability is also nice even trough an ac10 +7str idol can be camped at 40ish in Droga(Might be Nurga always get the two confused).<P>Posion. Never really used it. Expensive,Room consuming, and time consuming. If they stacked it might be worth the effort to carry a couple 10 stack posions around with me when I go to do things.<P><BR>Just a few ideas that I was tossing around in my head.<P>Vorax Shadowalker<BR>Barbarian Yard Tool of the 3rd Rank<BR>Events Officer of Dynasty<BR>Bristlebane Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>From reading the comment about Evade, and knowing how Feign Death works.  It appears to me the biggest problem is mob agro code, which needs to be reworked.  Mobs shouldn't have onipotence in regards to all the players in the zone, if you fixed it so they were truely only aware of people in their agro range or even twice their agro range, this would solve a lot of problems.  One would be evade wouldn't need nerfed, as it would no longer drop rogues off the agro list.  Two it would save mobs from tearing across zone after a necro/monk/shadowknight that just got up from a successful job of feigning death.  Please consider fixing the coding versus nerfing class abilities!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I love my Eguor, 31st halfling rogue.  Much more fun to play than my Rackle, 48th dwarven cleric.<P>If there are factors preventing a backstab, such as just after an instill doubt, then make the backstab button greyed!  If I can't do something, use the interfact to let me know.<P>Does casting a spell on a hiding rogue still remove his/her invisibility?  I haven't read any patch message stating that this was fixed.<P>Pickpocket is a troublesome skill.  Make the loot be obtained from a different "pocket" than the one used to hold the regular items.  Or, simply duplicate the current loot items/money.  If a group enrolls the help of a rogue, they increase their loot twofold!  Or, put a message to alert the other members that the rogue has pickpocketed items/money.<P>Backstab damage should be visible to the group, much like critical hits are.  Why?  Same exact reason that warrior critical hits are displayed.<P>Sneak/hide should work across zones.  Casters can remain invisible across zones, so should rogues.<P>Poison.  At level 31, I still haven't touched the stuff.  I have no intentions of killing tons of green mobs in order to harvest the necessary components.<P>There has to be a fun way to increase pick lock skill.  In its current form, I have pressed that spacebar (temporarily remapped the U key) with one hand while the other hand was holding the book I was reading.  Granted the book was fun to read, but the experience of raising that skill was not.<P>Not limited to rogues, but all halflings should have the effect of fear when removing their footwear.  Come on, no one should have to see those furry feet!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1) Out of curiosity, do you look at the below double backstab game when judging the damage output of rogues vs. other classes?  I always see double backstab as being the big thing that people point to when they say how much damage rogues can do.  I may never get to level 55 (I'm 49 now).  How does my damage NOW stack up against other similar level melees?  I'd say we're not the crazy damage dealers that you think we are.<P>2) PUT IN SOME NEWBIE ROGUE QUESTS FOR GNOMES!!!!!<P>The gnome race gets the shaft left and right (nice plate based racial armor for the 10 people on each server who play gnome warriors and clerics, or Brell imbued jewelry that's perfect for all those Dorf clerics, but suck for gnome rogues and casters).

</FONT><HR>Well being a rogue from May 14 1999. I've seen alot of great things happen for me. I thought I was a pretty awesome character even before the min damage on backstabs was fixed, Before sneak/hide was invis to undead, before evade.<P>All those things are gravy. Now you are going to ruin Evade. Well Never has my evading made a mob go after something across the zone. If anything that is an urban myth. Some mage was sitting at the zone,  His pet went AWOL and died, Then the mob came running after the mage and the mage blamed it on a rogue. <P>Here are things I think should be fixed. <P>1) If you become visible, the Hide button should pop up and you should get a message. No excuse for it not to.<P>2) Hide/Sneak through zoning. If you have to in order to make it work, add a spell icon. Name it complete invisibility. I cannot have an invis cast on me when I am hidden. Make it so no other spell over writes the complete invisiblity. Simple solution. Make the duration permanent until any action that normally breaks hide/sneak is preformed. <P>3) Make poisons stackable, and allow their use to more than just rogues. As a trade skill it's mainly personal use. Shamans get potions that others can use other than their own class and can profit from their trade skill. Make it so the real high level poisons are rogue only if you want to limit their usage. If you cannot make poisons stackable, allow us to make 10 charge poisons like Shamans can with their potions. <P>4) Feign death. Give it to us. 3 Classes already get this skill. SK's, Necro's and Monks. SK's and necro's because they are masters of the dead. Monks due to control of their bodies. Well it has been said for a long time it fits in with rogues. We are the masters of deception. Don't want it over powering. Cap us low. 100 skill max or something. <P>5) Crits on throwing. Well frankly they suck. At least deadly strikes. If deadly strikes are supposed to be a thrown backstab then it should reflect as such. Make a min damage on deadly strike based on skill or level. Keep the regular thrown crits the same. <P>6) Highlight our backstabs. You did it for our throwing crits and deadly strikes. But no one ever sees my backstabs. I have to brag in order for others to know. If someone has other's hits off they miss our backstabs. They are a special attack like thunder kicks. We deserve the recognition. <P>7) Sneak speed. Instead of full run at 60. Make it's speed skill based above 100. At 200 sneak I am twice as skilled as a master. I should be able to sneak like it was nothing. <P>8) Limited tracking. We're assasins or scouts right? Fits perfectly. Cap it at 100.<P>9) Instill Doubt. Fix it for rogues. Allow us to backstab after we scare them. Heck you describe the rogue ability to instill doubt as a perfect way to plant a dagger in the backs of our foes. Make that a reality. <P>10) Sense traps. Put better range on it. As it stands, The range is shorter than the distance I can sneak during the refresh on the button. I can hit the sense traps button and most times I'll find the trap by running into it first. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have a 60 rogue, I've played this rogue about 2 years and have been level 60 for some time now.  FWIW, I work in as a designer a game developer.   I'll be brief.<P>- Range attacks:  Their only value is in pulling yet the range of our handy range weapon, the bracer summoned dagger, is quite short.  I strongly feel this range should be extended.  Rogues make excellent puller given our ability to sneak pull and at higher levels pluck single mobs with knives.  A little more range on the knives please.<P>- Range damage:  I expect the rogue was never intended as a range damage dealer but our throwing damage is laughable.  Rogue crits and deadly strikes on throwing are an embarrassment.   Hitting a mob with 9000 hp for a 32 point crit instead of 4 hit on the pull throw is a bad joke.  I realize these crits are only window dressing but honestly, I find it embarrassing to have the group see me crit for 32's while they miss my 500+ backstabs to the spam filter.   Respectable damage on our throwing crits would be welcomed and not alter the balance of power within the game.  <P>- Damage dealing role:  Recently I've come to feel the improvements to rangers damage has marginalized the rogue somewhat in the endgame.   A week ago while killing the queen in Chardok we had a ranger do over 5000 damage via bow in under a minute.  The endgame (the L60 game) is all about large-scale special encounters and the rogue disciplines, riposte aside, bring nothing to this.  <P>- Deadeye is made redundant by Kinesthetics, which in turn is made redundant by Duelist.  None have any function in a boss encounter in the end game.  <P>- Blinding speed is completely useless.  Anyone at level 58, realistically, is going to have some haste item and buffs on.  Blinding speed does not suddenly do massive damage, despite its billing.  The opportunity cost of using up ones discipline for a marginal 15 haste improvement is such that this discipline goes unused.   If it lasted 4 minutes and had a 90 minute reuse delay it would be a nice tool for boss fights, as is, its useless.   <P>- Assassination: terribly impressive and tons of fun and its a shame no one ever gets to see it.  Why?  Because at level 60 I'm not fighting L45 creatures.  Sure, I could be breaking into a Sebilis camp and maybe see it go off once in the hall on my way to where I'm going, maybe, but that's the extent of it.  The real value of assassination is in leveling twinks in guk, where I can drop frogs faster then they can be pulled.  Surely this is not the designer's intent?  I think raising the assassinate cap to 46 or 47 and decreasing it's frequency accordingly would make this far more rewarding.<P>And thats it.  Otherwise Im a happy rogue.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Anyone else not quite know what Absor meant when he said that evade reduces the rogue to the bottom of the hate list? It certainly doesnt reduce them to the bottom, as I've had it work hundreds of times and still have the mob agroed on me, not even fidgeting towards the tank, so I dont see a need for that nerf...Anyway, nerf or no nerf, I would hope that "You must be standing perfectly skill in order to hide!" doesnt occur as often, or is looked at. When trying too evade, I use it immediately after a mob hits me(regular hit, not even a bash) I will be pushed back slightly, making it impossible to evade for a fraction of a second: even when it appears I have stopped moving, if it seemed that way at all. Since mobs hit quicker at higher levels, this problem has gotten increasingly bad. Evade fails due to this more than it fails due to skill.  This also happens w/ hide, I will pull my finger off of the forward key and press my hide hotkey, only to be forced to wait another 8 or so seconds because the game thinks I was still moving. <BR>     Hide/Sneak while zoning/LD also seems like a very good idea, as casters' invis spells all last while zoning(enchanter illusions should also last from zone to zone).  If im scouting in a dangerous area, going LD will in almost all insances, be my death.<BR>     Track, in a limited form, also seems like it would fit the class.<BR>     Poison is WAY too expensive and time consuming for the effects produced, and it also eats away a LOT of inventory space.  If a rogue was to be a decent poisoner, they would NEED to master pottery, since buying a sealed poison vial from a merchant costs upwards of 5pp, if not more. And this is for an ATTEMPT to make a poison, and if thats successful for an ATTEMPT to apply it, which can be resisted/partially resisted...Also, killing greenies for rare drop poison ingreds is VERY boring and long..maybe make them more common or sold cheaply at a merchants.  And, since nobody wants to buy poison, it is very unprofitable, and requires masses of money to build the skill, which, at the level the skill is acquired, impossible to do, for non-twinks.<BR>     As a whole, I think rogues a very balanced, just a few minor things need re-evaluation, as I, and everyone else has mentioned the zoning while Hide/Sneaking, and poisons need to be checked.  I would also like to see a check of Evade's inabilty to be used after getting smacked by a mob...which is the only reason I would use it anyway.<BR>                              Lucao  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think that the rogues are quite a wonderful class to play indeed. I will say that there are a few things which could be enhanced to help them become a tad bit more balanced among the other classes.<P>1. Better throwing weapons: I've got a bow, I do 25 damage a hit... Why am I going to use a dagger which (even with crit) does less damage to a mob?<P>2.

</FONT><HR>1st point: <BR>If Evade is supposed to drop you to the bottom of the list, it is not working as intended all of the time. I can't tell you how many times I've gotten a "Successfully Evaded" message, but the mob still beats on me. This happens all the time.<P>2nd: Soul Bound lockpicks are a great idea.<P>3rd: Poisons. Something has to give here. There are so many angles you could take on making this skill more viable. I still think that poisons would be widely used if their effects were reduced in power, and acted as a proc for a certain amount of time. Of course with the new Ranger spells that would step on some toes, but I feel poison should have been handled better from the get go. I know it's been improved one hundred fold from the old days, but it's still not used like it should be. The rarity of ingredients, the "one shot dealiness" of the injections, not to mention resists. The price. THe application time...the list goes on and on. Wanna know how many people I know that use poisons other than on a "Big NPC" raid? Ummmm, NO ONE. The time and money do NOT pay off.<P>4th: Throwing skill: Unless you have a ton of Throwing boulders or stackable javelins, there is no reason in the world to use this over Archery when pulling. IMO. Its all about the range man! And the damage on what few practical throwing weaps we have is pretty pathetic too.<P>5th: Escape: Unless you have JBoots, if you are traveling alone, you have NO means of escape save Instill Doubt. Think of what other classes have. Root, mez, stun, SoW, songs, Fear, FD, ... you know, I am having a lot of trouble thinking of another class that has as weak a skill as Instill Doubt to rely for emergencies. Wanna know how many times ID has worked when something jumped me? hmm, NONE. Why can't the power of ID rise as you do? Why must it be stuck in level 4 Fear land? And don't say, "Why don't you just Hide/Sneak?" Have ya ever H/S'ed across a zone in Velious or Kunark pre 51? Talk about an exercise in wasting your time...that's ludicrous. The H/S increase in speed should begin long before 51.<P>Other than that I believe Rogues are in decent shape. Just a little tweaking to the skill set is in order. There is just no reason for some skills to be so worthless.<P>Emryss, xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>How bout this? Make Rogues appealing for groups. Yes Rogues are wanted in the higher levels for our Pick Lock skill and such, but what about the earlier levels. <P>Again I go back to a post I posted a couple days ago. It always takes me 30+ minutes to find a group, even longer, in a zone that has 70+ people in it. As I auction, I contemplate on why a group would want a Rogue. <P>Basically all I'm saying is give us something that benefits a group for having you. For example: Monks are great pullers, everyone should agree to that. Warriors are the top tankers. Shamans are Jack-of-all-trades. Enchanters have awesome mana regen and Mob control spells. Casters have massive DD spells to finish the mob as well as pets. Bards are group favorites with numerous group songs. Rangers are a great melee class with spells to back them up, and are usually taken before a Rogue because, at least they can heal. Paladins and Shadowknights, better melees than a Ranger and they can cast spells. Clerics, well not much to say here, every group needs one. Rogues, well what are we good for? We can backstab. Hmm well it is nice, but is getting a Rogue for backstab worth passing up a Ranger that can at least buff, heal and fight? <P>What do Rogues have to offer in the levels, let's say 1-40, that no other class can offer and do better? All these request for added skills and class tweaks are nice, but considering we have to group in this game, how do these wishes benefit a group and make us desirable? <P>I have brought this up many times with no response and I'm quite sure I'll not get one this time. Many Rogues want all these changes which I agree with some, but all in all Rogues skills are fine, I just want the desire of a Rogue to be higher instead of in the higher levels. Truthfully I don't have any suggestions on how to do this but it's something that I would like to be looked at.<P>Thanks for your time</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I. Poison<P>a) Poison vials need to be able to be combined with charges like a potion. There is no reason either mechanically or gameplay that they can't. If they can't be combined, just like potions, they take up too much room in our inventory to be carried.<P>b) Poison Interruptions- When attacking a mob, if you are moving only a little bit poison casting is interrupted. If you are attacked in the middle of the proc, it will be interrupted. This should not happen. Give me a reason gameplay wise that an applied poison can be interrupted? Don't know how hard it would be to code, but look at it.<P>c) Poison Application- How hard can it be to put poison on a knife blade? But we still fail at this quite often, and skill raises are few and far between.<P>II. Evade<P>a) Moving- If you are moving, or hit with small knockback, etc, while you evade, you fail. Seeing as how evading is 'Ducking out of combat' I don't see why moving prevents it from working. This occurs because evade is bound on the same key as hide. Either find a way to fix this, or move Evade to it's own button that doesn't check for movement.<P>b) Hate List- Sometimes this ability doesn't work at all. And you can't evade onto a pet (Mob will not switch aggro to npc's). Please consider some of these things when you make any changes to the evade skill. And realize that this one skill is EXTREMELY important to the Rogue's viability. It is the only way we survive.<P>III. Grouping- Rogues still have problems finding groups pre-40. Yes, after 40 (and after 50 especially) we come into our own, but before this we really don't offer much to a group that varies from other people.<P>IV. Soloing- While I know you don't want to look at soloing when doing these threads, just remember that the Rogue is the only class in the game that has to farm green mobs for hours to be able to solo post 20. Unless a rogue has a lot of money to spend on poison components (Twink or good trader) it takes hours on end to collect enough components to *maybe* be able to solo a blue mob.<P>V. Illusions<P>a) It would be nice if they would zone with us. Not needed, but added functionality (Enchanters have been asking for this too)<P>b) Allow us to click them off like you can with SoW and other buffs. Give that to enchanters too. That should make everyone happy.<P>VI. Skills<P>a) Disarm- Worthless skill unless in PVP. Weapons have no effect on mobs besides procs, and we can't disarm magic weapons so...<P>b) Instill Doubt- Nice skill outdoors. Is extremely hard to raise. Absolute death if used in a dungeon. The backstab doesn't work afterward because of the 'kick' damage component associated with ID. Just grey out secondary attacks after instill doubt is used successfully.<P>c) Safefall- It's level is fine with me as far as Verants interpreation of the rogue.<P>d) Sense/Disarm Traps- Some traps just can't seem to be sensed, even with a maxed out sense skill. I can see the big rock crashing down from the ceiling in Sol B. I can stand in front of it. I can disarm it, but I can't detect it...<P>e) Backstab- Would be nice to see a message along the line of critical hits, but we get enough spam already.<P>f) Pick Pockets- One of the banes of our existence. Necessary to get our epic, pisses off some people in groups (It hits them in their wallets). Something needs to be done with this, but I don't know what.<P>g) Assassinate- Is a neat ability. Don't touch it. Some people are complaining that it doesn't kill Velious mobs in one hit. My response is "So?".<P>VII. Armor<P>a) Ravenscale is annoying to get. You have to random with others in your group, where as other classes get their quest armor pieces automatically. Change Ravenscale so that it's a quest.<P>b) Assassins Armor- Is this stuff Tunare's joke? It looks horrible. No assassin would be caught dead or alive in flashy gold armor. You say we can't have a better particle effect on Ragebringer because it wouldn't be "roguely"? Have you SEEN this armor?<P>c) Mrylokar's Armor- Boots and Gauntlets are still the 2 rarest piece's of Kunark armor. Do a server count and you will see what I mean. Maybe people are hunting in these areas, but I am more inclined to believe that the drop rates and spawn times are lousy.<P><BR>That's my initial response. Let's see where this goes.<P>Caowyth Shadowbane<BR>Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>As a Level 51 Rogue, I would be 100% happy if Rogues remained exactly as they are today.<P>Now of course, there are a few things that would be nice (evil roguish grin). Nothing major:<P>1 - Poison on throwing weapons. Why not? Poison is nearly useless (but that's fine, not asking for a change to Poison), so why not let it be done from a (limited - we are talking throwing weapons) distance? It would be fun  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>2 - Level-based increase to Throwing range, or new Throwing weapons with increased range. I have heard +1 per level suggested. An additional 60 feet at level 60 would hardly be unbalancing. The only point of this would be to make Throwing a viable pulling option.<P>3 - An upgrade to the Burning Rapier, preferably in the form of another quest. LOTS of Rogues never do this masterpiece of a quest, because the weapon isn't that great. I propose a GOOD (on par with the Slime Coated Harpoon, which is the current bridge between Burning Rapier and Trakasaur's Tooth) upgrade to the Burning Rapier...how about...<P>Rapier of Incineration<BR>9 Damage 23 Delay<BR>10 Dex, 10 Agi, 5 Str<BR>Effect: Fire Based DD ~70 Damage<BR>ROG/ALL, naturally  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Stats are just a suggestion, but make it so that people actually *want* to do the quest. Make the quest just as long and involved as the original Burning Rapier quest, and make the BR a REQUIREMENT.<P>4 - Theives' Cant Rogue-only. What is the point of Theives' Cant if Druids and Paladins can understand me?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well where to start::<BR>If you nerf evade for dropping us off hate list,<BR>I think that FD should also be nerfed to do the same, because its far to usefull for getting off the mobs hate list.<P><BR>Now then::<BR>Poisions: They components need to drop alot more, <BR>I had to kill 57 snakes for 2 poison sacs. Thats a bit to many, I should have to kill maybe 2 snakes, seeing as how they all(darkweed) can poison you.<BR>Poisons should also stack, like VI said with Alchamy they can't stack, well then give the poisons charges like potions do. <P>Quest armor: MAKE RAVENSCALE QUESTED FOR!! How many other classes have to roll against a druid or shaman or wizard or warrior for thier quest armor?<BR>Lets count.. oh.. hhmm none.. thats right rogues are getting shafted on quest armor. People just go in and camp it cause its easier than doing quests so they can twink their new newbie alt. <BR>If you will not make ravenscale quested for, then put in some deception masks we can quest for that would be about as difficult to get as say.. totemic armor; and able to complete at about the same level as totemic(i used totemic as an example because its the first quest armor to pop into my head). You could make us quest for various deception masks, such as ogre, high elf, half elf, dwarf, gnome,(and if you really wanna be nice skeleton  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ). These would also be shared with bards, just like the other masks, but make them NO DROP so the components aren't farmed for some thing else to make us roll on. I think the masks would be a great additon to the rogue (and bard I guess  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"> ) class for quests.<P>Instil Doubt/Intimidate: The success rate on this is way way to low. It takes about 20 tries to scare off a level 1 mob, thats pretty pathetic if you ask me.<P>Safefall: I think the cap should be hired. Just seems roguely to be able to fall off higher and higher things as you get more practice.<P>Oh a VERY BIG HUGE GIGANTIC ISSUE::: Rogues are a chin class, Gnomes have a huge hole in their head when using chain armor!!
