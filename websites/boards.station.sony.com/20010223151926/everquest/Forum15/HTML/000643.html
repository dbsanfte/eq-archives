</FONT><HR>I would like to make a rational point about Balancing Hybrids.  <P>Lets first look at what each was intended to be:  A ShadowKnight is intended to be a Warrior crossed with a Necromancer.  A Paladin is a Warrior crossed with Cleric.  And a Ranger is a Warrior crossed with a Druid.  Hopefully no arguements so far.<P>Now lets look at defining features of each main caster class and the resultant hybrid.<P>Necromancers' defining characteristics are Damage spells, and undead pets.   ShadowKnights get damage spells and undead pets.<P>Clerics get heals, including complete heal, and good spells against undead.  Paladins get good heals, a form of complete heal (lay on hand) and spells against undead.<P>Druids defining features are Traveling spells (ports), middling level buffing and SOW.  Rangers get a few buffs (very low level), Crits with a bow (have been discussed to death elsewhere) and tracking (needs to be fixed ie. scroll bar).<P>Does anyone else notice something here.  Don't get me wrong I like my ranger and will continue playing him.  But it seems to be the only hybrid who inherits nothing from it's supposed parent caster class.<P>I understand balance, and know that ports at low levels would be overpowering, but how bout some self only stuff that would not realy unbalance.<BR>Nerfed SOW (self only and not quite as good) at 22.  Gate at 22.  Self only ports and self only bind in outdoor zone at 30 or 39.  By that high of level I don't see this as un-balancing,  I mean SK get pets, and Pal get CH.<P>So what does everyone think?<P>(by the way nothing of what I'm suggesting has andy bearing on me right now my ranger is only lvl 13)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I would like to make a correction to your post pallies do not and will not get CH closest we get it LoH and thats still not a CH, our LoH is somewhat related to our HP totals plus a few hundred hp, might be a ch to us paladins with our own buffs but if you use that on a buffed up warrior it will not fully heal them.<BR>Also you make it sound as if the rangers got none of there parent class spells, first off all 3 parent classes have bind and gate, but druids get ports, so now why if they other 2 hybrids can't even get bind and gate should rangers get ports? Seconds druids have damage spells, buffs and debuff spells which rangers do get in some form.  We hybrids get some of parent class spells but not the spells that make a necro a necro or a cleric a cleric or even a druid a druid, and besides that with the new expantion out there we hybrids have spells our parent classes do not. Aslo we hybrids are getting in good right now, varent is now looking at us and making changes as he sees them so before making too many demands lets just sit back and see what happens, maybe you will like the changes they put in maybe not but lets at least wait and see what the changes are before demanding more.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>When I said rational, I was hoping not to get angry emotional responces from pallies and Sks.  <P>I was suggesting improvements to rangers.  <P>You are absolutely right: all the casting hybrids should get bind (self only)and gate. I agree 100%  <P>however I still think ports (self only) would make a ranger have a slightly closer connection to its parent class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Shadewyn,<P>1. When you make a thread titled "A Rational Hybrid Discussion", do not be suprised when a paladin, shadowknight or bard shows up to discuss their views on the topic. Furthermore, do not be suprise when a thread title as such turns out to be what you want for the ranger class only, that these paladins, shadowknights, and bards are going to express their disagreement with. If you want to discuss rangers issues and only deal with ranger issues, title the thread approriately.<P>2. If you post public your views on a topic, you will get people who will disagree. If you are going to post your views, you have to be willing to justify them. If you are not able to justify them, do not post them. Also, just because someone disagrees with you and expresses their disagreement with you, does not mean that they are giving you an angry responce. You do a dis-service to Mujina by making a reference to his post as "...get angry emotional responces from pallies..." His responce was in no way an angry emotional responce. It was just a disagreement to your views that you failed to justify. You really should appoligize to him. <P>3. Now, as to rangers receiving bind or teleportation. First, I have to tell you that I believe that is just a pipe dream. Verant will never give rangers these abilities. Does not matter about any arguments you make on balance. The sole reason they would never give us these abilities is external to balance. It is because it would piss off to many other class. Come on now man, every other melee class would be royally ticked off and most likely quit the game if rangers were the only melee class to receive bind. And change that cause a mass amount of people to quit the game is a change that IS unbalanced. Same with teleport. But self-only teleports are even worse for the fact they beneift only that class. No other class would beneift from this change. That would make this change a clear increase in the power of that class and that class only. Any unjustifable increase in power to one class only is an unbalanced increase. <P>4. There are agruments about paladins receiving rez which is the primary key trait of their caster class parent, clerics. There are agruments about shadowknights receiving pets which is the primary key trait of their caster class parent, necromancer. But both of these give a group a justifable advantage. Paladins have rezs means that a group member may be able to get a rez from someone other then a cleric. A shadowknights pet means more damage done in a quicker time by the group. Self teleports and binds does not help the group in any way.<P>5. The key trait about rangers, and those that play rangers, are their ability to learn and know the locations that they travel and hunt in. They are guides for the classes. Their abilities and skills leads them to be able to do this effectively. This is more then just a roleplaying factor. It is even in the point of game culture. Those that play a ranger (by the nature of playing a ranger) often know more about any zone an more zones then anyone that plays any other classes. Rangers are often group pullers, this allows them to see more of the zone and its special features then any other person. I cannot tell you how many times that I knew more about the details of where mobs spawned, when they spawned, how they moved then any other person in my group. The ability to teleport will make the majority of rangers lazy in developing this knowledge base. This will intern make them less effective to be the groups puller. It is our familiarization of zones and shortcuts that is our boon. And no matter what you say, given the ability to teleport will make rangers more likely to do that rather then explore the zones and what is there and what is new.<P>-Wadin Pureheart of Quellious<BR>Ranger, 54 summers<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wadin, regarding SK’s:<BR>Shadowknight’s pet is a very (and I mean verrrrrry) watered down version of necromancer’s little bundle of joy and destruction. It’s damage output is so minimal that its impact on a group’s performance is quite pathetic. Actually, the pet becomes such a liability that most SK’s wont even summon one when grouped (especially in dense populated areas like dungeons). <BR>The pet has the uncanny tendency to aggro every green mob in the area.<BR>One thing that makes us useful in groups is the “Summon corpse” spell. That paired with paladin’s resurrection can be very beneficial to any group (both spells also being used by clerics and necromancers).<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Darkrunner, I use my pet alot, more solo than grouped but in small groups (3-4) outdoors he is a help.  I get about 100HP of damage from him, but more importantly he is the delaying tactic for bad pulls (/pet attack on the add) gives me time to fear the add before he hits the casters in the party.  Also gives druid a chance to snare at a distance.  Its all in the use, no its no Necro pet, but well worth the bubble of mana he costs me.<P>When I never use a pet, and why most SK's don't use them in groups, is when I'm the puller.  Thats when they get people hurt by chasing out to help you on a pull.  Whenever I'm in a full group I'm the puller but in smaller groups even in dungeons I still get a pet to help out.  Remember a pet is a disposable dot that may last thru several fights, but I'll never BUY bone chips to summon 1.<P>As for the original point of the thread:  how about we call it "please support making Rangers better".  Rangers need some work still, but not bind and gate.  A self only SoW is not only a bad idea, but a good way to never get into another group.  Lets think....Ranger has SoW, Cleric and Warrior don't, things go bad, the Ranger runs away and lives leaving the rest of his party to die....heh, let me rush to group with him.<P>What Rangers need:  A DD that does a reasonable amount of damage for the level they get it, all Heals 1 spell cycle earlier then they get them now and of course a few more HP's at higher levels so they stop dieing on their groups.<P>Neptunis Rex<BR>lvl 40 DE SK<P>(and yes I play a Ranger too on occasion but "the Dark Side" agrees with me more)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is to address several posts within this message thread.<P>First, I don't think Rangers should get ports any more than I think the other hybrids do.  I agree with the "Rangers know more about the territory" dogma.<P>Second, I think that the Bow crits need to be redefined.  We don't do enough damage (even with the special bows) to make us MASTERS of them.  Redefine them to be more like the warrior crits with melee weapons and THEN we can talk about being master of the bow.  My 29 Ranger with a max Archery skill only does 52 points max with a Crit while wielding a Trueshot bow, while a warrior at my level caps out at over 100 with a weapon during a fight (several times sometimes in the same fight!).<P>Pallies and SK's get alot from their classes.  Both wear darn nice (and strong!) armor, both get good spells and lets face it, I don't know too many peeps who haven't had their butts saved when either a LoH was used to heal them at a bad moment or Harm took a MoB from kicking butt to butting out.  Rangers may not be exactly healers or damage monsters, but they can contribute significatly to a party's overall success if their spells are used with a bit of wisdom.  <P>Flame Lick debuffs more than just AC, but if it did only that I would still use it. Anything that makes the enemy easier to hit is a plus in my book. Any arguments against it, well, lemme ask you this?  Why do you fight so hard to scrape up all that plat to get that piece of armor that is only going to make your AC go up 4 points? `Nuff said on that.<BR>So we only get the smaller heals... I use them to help my healers out on mana between fights so they aren't strapped for mana during a heavy fight when I might need them to cast on MY sorry butt, or one of my companions.<BR>Snare, better than any root, when the mob is ready to run it RUNS, but don't go nowhere and doesn't turn on you, so that last bub of it's health is free and clear and can be used by the casters to med while the tanks and rogues finish the job without fear of reprisal.<BR>Snare.  I can kite til the cows come home using cheap arrows.  Nuff said.<BR>There are other more creative uses for our spells, these are just the more obvious ones.  I never have a problem with people wanting me in their group.  I use a 11/38 in my Prim hand and 6/22 in my secondary.  Damage is OK and would be on par with a warrior except for their crits. Primary hand even does 31 points now on occasion.<P>We just need a few tweaks to get the rangers evened out at mid levels.  The others don't know enough about to critique cause I haven't played them yet (will after I get this one to 60 tho   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> )</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here's some interesting stuff to throw in the 'rational discussion' stuff - all factual.<P>With the changes on Test, rangers will always do the same damage as warriors - and sometimes more damage thanks to DD spells when they have the mana.  Rangers are getting Offense AND weapon skills raised to 252, along with having Dual Wield skill capped as high as 240.  Also, with Jolt being lowered to 51, and a new fire based 'Cinder' Jolt being added at 55 - Ranger surviveability will significantly increase, and as their potential aggro reduces - their potential damage output increases.  Another important thing to note is that Rangers can use weapons of the same dmg/dly ratios as warriors.  And since mobs only ever hit one thing at a time, despite Rangers lacking defense, their added offense and damage ability is always welcome when a group or raid has a warrior already.  (Offense - damage output - stacks.  Defense doesn't)<P>On the other side of the coin, Knights are getting only their Defense raised to 252, while Parry, Dodge, Riposte and Hit Points remain the same.  This means that while Rangers are equivalent and sometimes better than warriors offensively, Paladins and Shadow Knights will remain significantly inferior than warriors defensively.  Because of this, once a group has a warrior, any high damage dealing melee will be preferred to add to the group over a Paladin or Shadow Knight with their very low dmg output. Why? Offense stacks, Defense doesn't.  To compound the offense vs. defense issue - Warrior Kunark class armor has 43 raw AC over Knights, while Knight's class armor has only 17-19 raw AC over Rangers and Rogues.<P>Last but not least, Rangers got Trueshot and auto-parry disciplines, both extremely useful (the auto-parry being a very good defensive type disc).  Meanwhile Paladins got Holyforge - a useless waste, and Sanctification - 20second immune to magical damage only.  Hardly useful.<BR>Shadow Knights got a disc wasted on a HT upgrade, it is good though - but useless on the high lvl raids since uber mobs resist it still anyway.  And, at 60 they got that lifetap for amount they hit for -for what? 15 secs?

</FONT><HR>While it is true that we share qualities of both our parent, it doesn't follow that we are just merely hybrids of the 2 a Paladin is not just a warrior/Cleric and a ranger isn't a warrior/druid, thus while considering what aspects we inherit from our parent classes, they consider how these abilities fit the "Vision" of our class.<P>What is a Ranger then, and what skills define him?<P>-Ranger is an excelent tracker<BR>-Ranger is good with nature<BR>-Ranger has excelent archery skills<BR>-Ranger is a profitient warrior and an agresive attacker, high on offence<BR>-Is Porting a defining quality of Rangers? No<BR>-Is Gate a defining quality of rangers? No <P><BR>What are a Paladin's defining features?<BR>-Paladins are high class warriors, not jugglers, we don't get dual wield.<BR>-Paladins get somw clerical abilities, including heals, bufs and stuns. but of much lower levels then a cleric.<BR>-Paladins can once in a while use LoHs to save a life, only once every 45 minutes. (but since it's only used in an emergancy it used far less then every 45 minutes, more likely on the range of once a week myself) <BR>-Paladins are defensive wariors, low on offence high on defence. they protect thet innnocent, not wage war.<BR>-They are enemies of the undead<P>what defines a Sk:<BR>-They are evil<BR>-They command the undead. (thus they get pets)<BR>-they learn offensive magic of the Necromancers (DD and Dots and defuffs)<BR>-They sap away at people's life energy (life tap)<BR>-They are dedicated warriors, not fierce beserkers, thus they don't get dual wield.<BR>-They reley on their evil arts to inflict damage more, and don't show weakness, therefore they are more defensive in fighting then offensive.<BR>-They can use HT, a corruption of the Paladin's ability. Used only once every 45 minutes, but ussually saved for emergancys.<BR>-Thus the SK doesn't get such spells like the Necro's that transfeeres hitpoints from one target to another or trades HP for manna, or the necro rez spells<P><BR>Also take into consideration that Druids have the greatest variety of spells of the 3 casters, They are in essence a jack of all trades already, so the other 2 hybrids have far less variety to choose from. Also rangers get a far better variety of Spells from Druids then a Paladin gets, all of the Paladin buffs are overwritten by the clerics which are essential for most serious groups. While the ranger buffs are almost always useful, since Druids are less essential for groups and have much much better uses for their manna then to keep everyone buffed. that means a ranger's buffs are still in demand when grouped with a Druid, then a Paladin's buffs are when grouped with a cleric.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000643&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000643&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
