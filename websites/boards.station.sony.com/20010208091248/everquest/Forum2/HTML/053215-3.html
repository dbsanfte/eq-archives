</FONT><HR>Ok, here's my 2 cp on the SK topic from a low lvl point of view.<BR>I just hit 20 and have come to realize a few things.  I am 'meat'.  I take dmg, and I take it a lot!  I am not disappointed by this role... however I am disappointed by the fact that I can do very little to enhance this role.  For example, my lifetaps stink.  My last one was gotten at 15 ( I believe) and gives me 11 hp a shot.  This is assuming I can get it off in the middle of the fight as there are usually 2-4 mobs bashing/slashing/hacking the crud outta me.  Remember, I am 'meat' for the other classes to have time to do good dmg.  Perhaps you could decrease the casting time on lifetaps a bit and increase the recast time to compensate.  I find that (even when the spells are well timed and with very little lag), I might get 1 out of 10 lifetaps off in a fight... and when that fight lasts for maybe a couple minutes... that doesn't leave much time for me to heal myself.  The other hybrid mobs, pally's and rangers, can sit down and heal themselves (however dismally) during the fights downtime.<BR>I would also like to comment on my approval of the current dot's and such at lower lvls... admittedly, some of them are a waste of space yet a few small spells are quite useful.  Disease cloud and the darkness line being particular favourites as they are good taunters in a fight, and disease cloud is also a good practice spell for conjuration (not that I enjoy casting a lvl 8 pet at lvl 20).  IMHO you could increase the effective taunt of these spells for sk's.<BR>At any rate, a definite improvement is needed on the current sk lifetap line and it's actual usefullness in the game when I might (if I lifetap from the sidelines for my entire fight) be able to get back half a bubble of hp for my entire bar of mana.<P>Koakila<BR>Luclin Server<BR>Lvl 20<BR> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here are some short and concise reccomendations for SK spell tweaks.<P><BR>-Necromancer have root and stun spells, so do Paladins and Rangers, why not SK's too? These would be very nice group oriented spells for the SK's arsenal.<P><BR>-Screaming Teror, I don't think I have to explain how immensly usefull this would be in group situations<P><BR>-Shielding and spirit armor line of spells: You say SK's are defensive hybrids? Here are some great defensive spell lines that necromancers have that would be great for SK's<P>-Pet buffs: Give SK's access to a pet buff spell or two, this would go a long way in making SK pets usefull.<P><BR>-give SK's and upgrade to dark empathy. Perhaps some type of spell that would take a certain amount of the SK's hit points and divide them among group members?<P><BR>-faster casting and faster acting spells. The main reason that most of the high level SK spells are not usefull is because they take far too long to cast and far too long to run their full course (and they also dont stack with necro spells and are overwritten). Faster casting faster acting spells such as venom of the snake would be much more SK friendly.<P><BR>-lifetaps: The best life tap that SK's ever get is Lifeleech, the level 49 quest spell. The reason it is the best is because it casts fasts and does enough damage to not COST us damage to cast. All of our other lifetaps have excessively long cast times and do not heal near enough hit points to make them worth casting. At level 57 Lifeleech is still the lifetap that I use. Also Vampiric curse (lifetap dot) is really not usefull at level 57, once again it really just does not heal enough hit points  to make it worth casting. I reccomend getting rid of the level 51, 55, and 60 lifetaps. Move Vampiric Curse to level 51 (or preferably 49) where even though it takes a long time to work it would heal enough hit points to make it worth casting for healing purposes. At levels 55 and 60  give us some type of upgrade to Lifeleech (fast casting, large chunk of hit points, etc.)<P><BR>-Harmshield? Paladins get divine aura, why don't we get the necro version?<P><BR>I have some other ideas which I will post later. It's getting kind of late here now  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, i haven't read all of the posts, so I don't know if this has already been said or not, but either way i'd like to say it.<BR>Talking with another sk in game, he brought up a idea of a Shield-block skill. This was very interesting to startoff with and got more reasonable as i thought on it.<BR>Anyone can just hold a sheild in front of their body to cover some area from attack, but it takes skill to be able to deflect the hardest of attacks (eg., slanting the sheild to let a lance slide off it in a joust) and be dexterous overall in defensive maneuvers with a bulky sheild. <BR>I love having a shield as an sk- it sets me apart from War.s in that i give away some (alot actually in dual-wield, and less-so in 2hnd) offensive dmg to be able to defend my HPs better after ive taunted the mob with my infuriating spells (for the mob), and therefore tank better.<BR>It was said we give up some melee effectiveness for spells. This is very easily seen in our quite low (comparably) dmg output, melee-wise. So I see no reason to be less than War.s or monks in defense, but we are, to a degree--i'm not saying hps here, thats different than def.<BR>A point that would line up my next argument well is this: I got a chitin sheild (15ac) at lvl 12--i used that cheap thing for 25 lvls till Kunark came up with an upgrade(i was using for ac alone in this sense). I think this is quite a gap. Overall i think shields need to be reevaluated on what theyre supposed to do. A shield has so much more defensive capabilities in a competent hand than any piece of body armor. Can a BP stop an attack before it has a chance to gain all the force of a full swing/pierce? No, but a shield obviously can. This is, of course, a RL point, but i also see it as a RP one too. <BR>If a sheild doesnt have enuf to give to your defense, one might as well get a 2hnder that _does_ add a significant amount of offense, which i see many peeps do and promote. Now, when i think of a Paladin (or anti-Paladin, ie sk) i think of gleaming shield with a coat of arms or sunburst emblazoned across its face (anti-images also). But many of my brethren (who arent twinked with higher lvl 1hnders) are neglecting a significant part of their defense -the shield. Of course, it's not a vital part, and 2hnders will always have thier allure, but shield must have theirs as well. The only two that have caught my eye are of course the sarnak battle shield (tho it cud be alil bigger than a serving platter; i have yet to see a full chin-to-ankle tower sheild that did the Romans so well) and the shimmering Velious ice sheild.<BR>So, i see either creating better ac sheilds-better than a BP of comparable lvl, or adding Shield-block (basically an additional parry on the secondary hand) to Pallys, sks, and wars to add more realism overall and to add a lil bit to Pally and sks defense and group-viability.<P>Overall-this is a vote for higher defense in the general sense<BR>Thx, <BR>Senexorator<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A LOT of SK stuff gets the double reduction in effectiveness,if not worse.<BR> <BR>Multiple lower skill caps is a cumulative effect. Reducing our skill caps in three skills by 5% each effectively makes us 15% weaker than a "pure" user,for example. And it's more than three skills when it comes to melee. SK's AND Paladins are plate-class armor users. We use the best class of armor,hence we should be able to optimize our defensive skills.<BR> <BR>Rangers don't. They should be able to optimize their offensive skills. NONE of us as hybrids should get both,but rangers get a skill that could easily be made useful yet non-warriorish...archery.<BR> <BR>We as SK's should be ubertaunting tanks. One of my fellow mid-level brothers put it correctly. We are the best meat shields in the game at lower levels. We have superior taunting capacity and before skill caps,we can take it almost as well as a warrior can-if not better.<BR> <BR>At high levels,we can taunt but can't tank anymore. No. That has also been said to be a top priority for 50+ play. That we can tank,and that we have a role in the large-scale encounters. Improvements to our ability to absorb and deflect damage would go a long way towards fixing both of these problems.<BR> <BR>Shield use is a key to that. Nobody uses shields like SK's and paladins do. This screams "defense" to me. Our DoT's aren't the killing machines a necro of the same level has,nor our lifetaps-but they add up with our lesser melee skills to give us effective roles at lower levels. <BR> <BR>I WILL sit there tanking a yellow-red mob while my party takes on something else at 27th. And survive long enough for them to mangle the primary,lay a heal on me,and rip apart my target as well.<BR> <BR>I've done my job. I tanked it and if I needed to,I could have even gotten the primary target on me if the primary damage dealers are getting too weak-and survive that too.<BR> <BR>Why is it tougher and then impossible for me post 50 to consider this?<BR> <BR>Give me debuffs that enhance my defensive capacity,and will also serve as good taunts. Shadow Vortex looks perfect as far as this goes-we need more and better like it,up and down the level list.<BR> <BR>I get my spells at higher levels AND they're weaker than the parent's version. Get rid of the double standard and my lifetap line is useful,not a cheap healing toy.<BR> <BR>Thanks.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sorry for another post, But since the other was was not on this thread by accident (and seemingly lost in the large jumbles of threads) along with the fact that I realized I worded myself wrong, and made it look as if I was suggesting way more than what I actually think will help balance SK.<P>As Absor stated, warriors are the standard for all tanking classes, and rightfully so.  Many suggestions have been to make SK have more HP, AC, And skill cap increases.  This takes away from what makes us SK, and makes us warrior copies. <P>Simply allow us to do what we are supposed to do along the lines of an opposite/twisted version of the Paly.<BR>lvl 1-9 we are the same as palys except have HT instead of LH, even though our HT is resistable and LH isn't.  While I think it is nice that HT has had its damage increased (and resist decreased) I'd have rather seen no dam increase and no possible resistance (for those in our lvl range).  The more I thought about a flat no resist, the more I saw major balance problems.  I would suggest 'lvl range' to be anything we con that is yellow or below.  Yellow or below us should have no resistance to our HT and anything red should act the same in resistance as it <BR>always has (and in all the suggestions below, the lvl range should be taken into account when I write 'no resistance').  If I knew how casters worked better I would suggest this would help a lot of their balance factor complaints as well.  Unless a foe has a storyline/rp reason for being completely impervious to magic, someone in their 'range' should be able to cast on them.<P>So for SK to be balanced with warriors, we need to adjust our damage output and soak.  But in a very SK way.  Paladins have what I call 'waves'.  Paly is fighting, gets low on HP, backs out of combat, Heals self as needed, steps back in and fights.  With all their healings (including divine purpose, and LH), palys in a group with other tanks can 'take care of themselves' for a bit before needing the healers to heal them (as pure melees will always need).  Their buff spells HP/AC help in this as well.  Up to lvl 30 we are pretty 'twisted' in our version.  Take from foe and give to Me.<P>lvl 9 paly   10HP heal<BR>lvl 9 SK     5HP  (10 points between foe and us)<BR>lvl 15 paly  35HP<BR>lvl 15 SK    11HP (22)<BR>lvl 30 Paly  100HP<BR>lvl 30 SK    45 (90)<P>very close to each other indead. But due to what I see as hybrids can only get parent caster spells in the same increments as the caster, we fal majorly behind.  (exclude pet which is a mana effecient DoT, and a few nice surprises) Meaning in general at lvl 9 we get necro lvl 1 spells, at lvl 15 we get their 4th lvl spells, at lvl 22 we get their 8th lvl spells, etc.  But this makes us lag really behind in our ability to be a 'self sufficent' tank, that with our lower HP and AC, would balance us with warriors, but not make us copies.<P>lvl 39 paly 300HP Heal<BR>lvl 39 SK (still our 45 (90point))<BR>we don't get around 150 (300 points difference) until lvl 56 (spirit tap). Even siphon life (75) which will still be a 150 point total difference between the foe loosing and us gaining would be nice).<P>lvl 39 paly get a nice self HoT (Heal over Time)<BR>1200HP over 150 Ticks.  SK don't even get our version DoT to them/HoT to us, until lvl 57 when we get the lvl 29 necro Vampiric curse, which is only around 189Hp (Where is the other 800ish HP?)<P>lvl 57 Paly get a nice 600HP heal.  We get our 150 (300, and what would have been more 'even' at lvl 39 for us).  Here SK need Drain Spirit the 226 (452 total difference) spell. <P>And since Palys don't get another Heal, we shouldn't either.  I am talking balance, not overbalance.<P>As with HT these Taps should not be resistable by those in our 'range'.  If this were the case, we would be upping our damage in Uber encounters (with a limit, unlike pure melees that fight till dead, due to our mana lowering) and be an alternative (neither better nor worse) than warriors, but different.  With that damage going to our HP, we increase our HP without increasing our HP total.  Complete heals, etc. Still won't give the raw number of HP that warriors get when Completely healed, but will give us a reason for Uber raid groups to want us.<P>If it is brought up that at higher lvls the taps are close to necros, it might very well be.  But necros get very high damaging DoTs that we lack, and their HPs are usually going towards becoming mana (they have pets and us to tank), while ours are for physical resistance.<P>So in summary (since you stated you liked these)<BR>1. Please consider again no resist to HT for those in our 'range'.  This seems like it was probabaly debated time and time again.<BR>2. Make us the 'twisted/opposite' of Paladins as we should be (we are the Dark Knights after all), by having our Tap 'difference' which is Points taken from foe + points given to self (or 2x the Tap damage) at equivalent lvls, including the HoT, and our DoT/HoT.  At the lvl we get the new 'Tap', I suggest it cost about 1/5 (bub) of the mana bar for 'standard/human'.  5 taps per mana bar, which increases with lvl.  <BR>3. Make the taps not be able to be resisted to foes within our 'range', so we actually do contribute to melee (offense and defense) putting us on a temporary (until mana is gone) par with warriors the 'base.<P>A fun spell would be voice graft, and grim aura (the little necro lvl 1 spell that gives about 7-8 Atk) would be nice, and at least as fitting for a SK than a necro.<P>Thank you for your time.  I will add that the casting time not resetting the weapon delays has been a great improvement for balance.  <P>Tabia Thanatephoros<BR>Human Shadow Knight of Innorruk<BR>Tribunal Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Herein shall be what i feel are the best improvements to the shadowknight class.<P>Given that class based xp penalties are now gone, classes themselves need to be balanced by class or by equipment, not both.  For example, if an item does not grant a class specific ability or bonus, why should it be restricted to a certain class?  <P>1.) Harmtouch - I like this ability, a lot! however, in comparison to loh it needs a little something.  My suggestion is as many others have suggested before me, make it a lifetap.  SK's already have many spells along this line, why not make it tap, even if it isnt until 20, or even make it not tap every time, that would be helpful.<P>2.) spells - this is a subject that i feel is triple-penalized.  Not only do we get necro spells at a higher level, which is a significant penalty, we pay more to cast them, ouch, AND only get a few spells.  I think one or even two of these penalties are plenty.  I mean what SK has Mana near half of a same level necro?<P>3.) weapon skills - my opinion is this, SK's seem to be targetted to be 2hs towards the end-game.  Most good SK weapons are 2hs.  However we get bash instead of kick.  For large race SK's, they get slam, so bash they hardly use.  For small race SK's they can choose 1h or 2h with 1h they get bash, with 2h they get.... nothing.  Trade bash for kick, i would think an evil character would be more apt to kick than hit with a shield anyway .. hee hee.  As for offense and defense, make all classes cap the same.  Define the classes by the equipment they have.  Monks will hit faster and more often due to low delay attacks, wheteher it be hands, or any weapons only they can use.  Rogues, they have backstab, give them higer damage piercing weapons only they can use.  Rangers and bards seem to be the 1hs and, for rangers, bow users.  Give them better weapons of that type.  Warriors should be able to use 99% of every weapon in the game, leaving out class defining weapons and epic weapons.  Paladins should be the 1h + shield classes.  especially because no large race can be pally, they should not have kick, if they do i dont know, they should have bash instead.  Create shield and 1h swords for them, like you guys are doing /cheer.  Sk's should have the 2hs market, the class defining weapons should be great 2hs weapons.<P>4.) Defense - defensive caps should be the same for all classes.  But tweak one class by directly giving one point to defense by taking one away from offense and vice versa.  Again, define the class with equipment.<P>In summary, classes should be defined by equipment, not by stats, unless those stats are racially influenced.<P>thanks for the time!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A bit late but I've decided to put my own thoughts on this up as well.<BR>------------------------<P>    Up to level 50 all Hybrids maintained skill caps very close to warriors.  There was a slight overall skill cap disadvantage, signifigant hitpoint disadvantage, and a signifigant AC disadvantage on the high level armors.  Rangers paid an additional AC disadvantage, while paladins and shadow knights paid by a lacked duel wield.  This was the price hybrids paid for their spells, this was balanced, all classes had thier places.  Upon the addition of additional 51-60 levels this careful balance was lost.<P>    It was lost to an effort to further specialize the hybrids, which was not a bad idea, it was simply not completely followed through on.  Shadow Knights, along with Paladins were to be further specialized in their defensive abilites, while rangers were to be further specialized in thier offensive abilities.  The problem is that shadow knights simply maintained their relative defensive status compared to warriors, and actually fell behind further when taking disciplines into account, while having their offensive abilities fall became even more lacking.<P>    I simply ask that shadow knights defensive skills be increased to the level of a warriors, to reflect this specialization, while their offensive(offense+weapon) skills be set to 20 points behind warriors.  This would give shadow knights the defensive specialty they are claimed to have, while maintaining a VERY large offensive disadvantage.  Still falling very signifigantly behind in offensive skills, hitpoints, armor AC, and lacking duel wield.<BR>------------------------<P>    Bash is a primary skill of Shadow Knights and falls way behind, I would suggest a skill of 240 in bash by level 60 would be appropriate.  At least look at it and consider some increase.<BR>------------------------<P>    Shadow Knights seem to be lacking a 'big raid' discipline.  Leechcurse could fill this role, and would probably be the simplest solution, but it's to weak in it's current form.  Various ideas have been presented on this already, just something to allow this reported damage taker class to tank mobs hitting in the 600s, not as well as warriors though exactly how good would be something requireing testing.<BR>------------------------<P>    Shadow Knights(and all hybrids) should have higher Channeling skills.  This is an important skill to a class that's almost always in melee, and is very likely to be attempting to cast through being hit.<BR>------------------------<P>    It's been brought up before, but please take a look at all Level 51+ fizzle issues, this hurts all casting classes. <BR>------------------------<P>    This is not necessary really, but an idea with merit in my mind.  This pertains especially to hybrids, but all casting classes are affected.  Hybrids have a real problem using their spells due to the fact that mana regens very slowly when standing unless you have clarity.  So how about a slight increase to all casters to mana regeneration when standing?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just a few comments:<P>1.  I hope the other closed threads will be read, I posted in one just before it closed and I hope Absor will actually read it so I don't have to retype it here.<P>2.  One thing I mentioned there that is worth a re-mention is the idea to have the higher mana requirement of our SK version spells mean something.  In this case, 50% more mana cost?  Then 50% shorter casting time.<P>3.  I don't see what the problem is with raising skills.  I have noticed that to date VI has tried to address lack of damage and defense by bringing out new equipment.  The only problem is the equipment is hard to get and expensive.  My 45 SK can't afford a MoSS, or anything close to it.  I'm hoping my druid can buy it for her someday (thats the char I use when I actually need to get money or an item - the SK can't cut it in that respect).<BR>So you really didn't improve the lot of my character by releasing these items.  Now an increase in Off/Def, a new skill, spell, or something WOULD make a difference to EVERYONE.  Or if you really want to address it as equipment, then how about adding summoned cursed weapons for SKs (like clerics have).  At least then I might have a chance to use the item that is supposed to "balance" me.<P>4.  As for the stats themselves, I have read that even if SKs had the same skills as warriors, we still could not tank as well due to lower HP, and could not deal damage as well due to lack of DW and Disc.  So what is the problem?<P>5.  And lastly, I don't buy this "Warriors must excel at everything" bit.  I'm sorry, but a warrior is a generalist fighter.  He is a standard that all other classes are based on.  Lets look at a real life situation.<BR>A warrior is a soldier.  Ok, given that, lets take a specialist, a sniper.  Give both a sniper rifle, put them a kilometer apart, and see who wins.  Now give the warrior any other weapon and put them in close proximity, now who wins?<BR>Now how about someone who specializes in hand to hand combat.  Take the soldier's gun away.  Who wins?  Now arm them both and stick them in a forest somewhere.  Who wins now?<BR>See the point?  The warrior SHOULD NOT excel in everything.  He should do everything very well.  But a monk should outdamage him in hand to hand.  A rogue should outdamage him in pierce (with backstab).  A ranger with bows (and some other attack since bows are not being made into a major damage dealer on their own).  A paladin with that big old shield and sword should most likely be able to defend much better than a warrior, but not strike as hard.  And for the SK?  Maybe 2 hand weapons?  At the very least, our weapons+spells should take out a warrior every time.  Of course, we lose our mana, we are toast.<P>Doesn't this make sense?  One class can not excel at everything.  Each class has to have some way to fight that they excel at.  And to excel they HAVE to be better than a warrior in that method.<P>Telanau</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>In some ways,I agree with this last post.<BR> <BR>We must be good at SOMETHING. And it cannot be what others are good at in the same way.<BR> <BR>Someone noted that because we're melee casters,our channeling should be upped. Excellent thought,and one I agree with.<BR> <BR>I have no problem being "the class that takes hits". In fact,I want to be "the class that takes hits like a warrior but doesn't dish it out like one".<BR> <BR>At my level,I can keep a mob busy a long,long time-even with crappy lifetaps and VE. As a "defensive hybrid",I want to be able to continue this. Bump up our lifetaps a bit. We can't heal others like a paladin can,yet we're slightly behind on the chart for raw power. Give us more debuffs,especially debuffs-over-time effects so we can ubertaunt. Get our defense skills up to the max. Keep our offensive skills down-that role in the ranger/paladin/SK triad should be the rangers,as the least armored of the three. I can deal with being a lousy damage dealer if I can still keep a monster on me,take the hits,and stick out the entire fight.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As mentioned in the new Warrior talks, please add some Iksar Only Planes/uber/high level armor.  Maybe something with the effects of armor Iksar SK can't wear.  Also in reading the warrior thread I read that SK is a "casting warrior", but I find myself not being able to cast much that can override let alone stick on a mob if there are necros in groups.  Thus making the "casting" part almost useless.  Not being able to cause enough damage via meele to compensate for the lack of the 1/4 caster, eliminating us as a viable "warrior" type as well.  It seems we are invited on raids because they feel bad or are friends, no because we are very viable/needed.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>Example: In Icewell Keep, none of my spells stick, HT is fully resisted, can't taunt off cleric after heals, can't cause enough damage to compensate for the lack of spells, have to watch the warrior die because I can't hit mobs hard enough, quick enough, taunt off, etc..

</FONT><HR>Summary of Shadow Knight Needs 50+<P>OFFENSE:  We miss too many times and since we only have one weapon this is even more of a problem for us.  <P>Solution: Increase weapon skill caps.<BR> <BR>Suggestion:  Give us triple attack at level 55 since we only have one weapon this will not be unbalancing(In my opinion).<P><BR>DEFENSE:  Our total armor class rating should be second only to the Warrior class.  Rogues and Monks should not have better AC than Shadow Knights/Paladins who wear Plate Mail.<P>Solution: Increase Defense Skill Cap and/or AC on equipment to make us second on the AC tables (Classwise). <P>Suggestion: Bash Skill cap is rediculously LOW.  We should be equal to Warriors in this cap since no one uses shields more than we do.<P><BR>SPELLS:  Lifetaps should be Re-evaluated.  Having only a 45HP lifetap through level 50 is way to low to be useful.  Vampric Embrace wears off too quickly and is therefore not useful in combat.  <P>Solution: Consider giving these taps earlier in Shadow Knight lifespan.  Since it costs us more mana and we have a much smaller mana pool at lower levels than our parents (due to less INT) this would not be unbalancing. Make Vampric Embrace last as long as Shroud of Death.<P>Suggestion:  Consider more spell quests for hybrids in lower levels.  These spells would be unique to the classes and be slightly nerfed versions of Necro Spells.  Since some lines of Necro spells we never see this would add to our versatility and make the class more fun to play in lower levels (Okay this is my one pre-50 suggestion).  These spells could be deity based and possibly focused on Race Specific deficiencies.  For Example Dark Elfs could get an enchanced Steal 25 Strength spell, Ogres and Trolls could get Steal INT spell...<P>Armor Comment:  Okay I will repeat this.  Why is it that Iksar's can wear Plate Armor from POG??<BR>I thought that was a race limitation due to their natural AC buff. I suggest another type of armor be developed for Iksar in POM which gives them a lower AC type so as not to infringe on the other races who wear plate.<P>Kaitan (Nightmare Clan)<BR>55 Shadow Knight<BR>Ayonae Ro<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, here's my ideas:<P>1: SKs need higher caps on defense/offense/weapon skills.  A SK or Pally should be able to specialize in one weapon skill, and one only.  They will be able to raise that skill to 250, but all others will have the current maximum.<P>2: Drop the mana/cast time penalty for SK spells.  Keep resist rates the same though.  <P>3: Add more spells for hybrid classes.  SKs are supposed to be the evil inverse of a paladin.  Since paladins get alot of buffs, SKs should get alot of UNIQUE debuffs (i.e., stacks with magician/shaman/etc debuffs).<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I play a paladin, but I think SKs and Paladins need the same things for the most part:<P>1) defensive discipline. velious mobs CANNOT be killed without this disc, and because pallie and SKs dont have it, they are not tanks. Give them this disc, not watered down at all. They have enough other disadvantages that an equal strength defensive disc is not going to unbalence things. (If you have to give at a later level, I dont really care. Heck make it at lvl 60 if you have to, but I'd like to see the re-use time at 60 the same as a lvl 60 warrior).<P>everything else would be nice, but I think (1) above is the main thing:<P>2) Raise some skill caps, most likely the defensive skills. The hybrids get lower skill caps, less damaging weapons, lower ac armor, etc.. lower in every regard. This is all just too much. Either raise some skills, OR raise the ac on some armor pieces, OR give better weapons, OR etc.<P>3) Add a quest to change the pally and SK epics to 1 handed weapons so they can equip a shield as well. Most of us have a vision of ourselves with sword and shield, give us this option. (Since NOT using our epic is clearly not a viable choice). [Note, I would be happy with a 1h weapon with all the other stats, including ratio unchanged, but if you feel you need to make the weapon faster, or nerf it because we would be equiping a shield as well, then so be it. ] This quest could be simply one to learn to wield the weapon one handed, perhaps given by some great master.<P>4) Give SKs Harmshield. Give Pallies, Shaman, and Druids a 50% heal spell (its half a complete heal, it always heals 50% of someone's total hps, same mana cost as CH) at the same level they get superior heal (53 for druids and shaman, 57 for pallies).<P>Thats my list.<P>-Iustus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First off to the post 2nd post above mine (above,above). Do you have an Iksar SK, have you ever seen the AC on a Iksar SK? VI didn't give enough of an AC bonus to Iksar to make up for lack of Plate. Ask any uber-level Iksar to tell you, w/o PoG armor (something as good for their level, but not plate), how much AC they have and you find that they have less than almost all the other SK race/class combo.<P>ANYWAY here is what I really want to say.<BR>DIRECT QUOTE FROM WARRIOR THREAD<BR>&lt;&lt;First, a few of my observations about warriors (you need to know this so that you can correct me where I'm wrong). As the 'base' class that other combat classes are built around, it should be very hard to find anything that is in need of change for the warrior. I'm reading things like more hit points no. If we change warrior hit points, then we have to change all the other classes hit points, since the basis for hit points, at least on tanks, is the warrior. <BR>I really don't expect to find too many things that need to be changed about warriors. <P>Also, I actually hope to see as many suggestions for 'nerfs' as for improvements. Keep in mind that the warrior is pretty much the base class, so it is very unlikely that we will be improving something that has any major effect unless it addresses some deficiency. If not, then this might actually be one of those cases where we need to do a sort of give and take. I guess I'm saying that by their very nature, warriors just about have to be balanced, and an improvement to them might necessarily require a change to all other fighting classes to match them. And that's not really what I'm looking for. <P>And, well, just like every other class, I want to warn you that a close examination like this brings the possibility that we will see something that needs to be nerfed. For example, I really don't like the idea that warriors have so many spells available to them through items, especially things like invisibility. I intend to ask that these things be looked at. My suspicion is that they won't be removed, we don't like to do that. But as a matter of class balance, I think it should be looked at. <P>My most powerful D&D character, by far, is a warrior. He's not powerful because he fights really well, though that's part of it. He's powerful because he has a lot of items that allow him to act like a caster. He isn't that high level, but he is more wanted in groups than my higher level characters. He's obnoxious, too, so it's not because of his personality <P>Anyway, don't be too surprised if I don't pick a lot of suggestions from your lists. There might not be too much that needs changing.&gt;&gt;<BR>__________________________________________________<BR>SWEET, they listened to us about them having armor w/ some spells WE DONT EVEN GET! I love hearing the casting warrior rant, when they do eventually become casting Warriors, due to us not being able to land most of our spells they get about the same # of em.<BR>As it seems favoritism is being shown to Warriors in this case (get listened to more and actual responses, i'm pretty sure 2x)<P>NEXT (All are direct quotes, from players and then response)<P>&lt;&lt;'Another nice addition would be the addition of an "AE Taunt." In multi-MOB situations it would be nice if the warrior had a skill that would attract the attentions of more than one mob in the vicinity. Of course, this skill would have it's own drawbacks . . . be careful what you wish for.' <P>Ok, that's not such a bad idea. It has it's own drawbacks built right in. I'm even willing to suggest a version of this that might allow the warrior to attack all creatures in the area (one swing). But it would have to be very high level and very limited in re-use.&gt;&gt;<BR>__________________________________________________<BR>Why would you give Warriors one of our greatest assets, the ability to taunt most MoBs off of almost anyone, to them?<P>NEXT<P>&lt;&lt;'Another area where Warriors seem to be a little lacking is in the AC and HP department. I am not suggesting that a huge move is needed in either of these areas, but in the high level game, there is precious little difference between a warriors AC and HP versus the hybrids and melee "wizards" (Rogues and Monks).' <P>That's exactly the opposite of what the hybrids, monks and rogues say. A lot of them think that there is too wide of a gap between their hit points and/or armor class and that of a warrior, and they want more.&gt;&gt;<BR>__________________________________________________<BR>WAY TO GO! THATS TELLING THEM! KILL ALL THE COMMUNIST PIGS (inside j/k) ! SHOT DOWN! DESTROYED!<P>NEXT<P>&lt;&lt;'Other classes getting to close to warriors. I believe that warriors should be able to tank better than Paladins and Shadow Knights. I see that you "noted" those classes wishes for higher hp, better defensive skills, higher offansive skills etc etc. What they asked for, was for you to make their tanking ability close to the warriors. Our tanking ability vs most normal mobs is fine (except for taunt), but if you increase the tanking ability of the SK and Paladin, keep in mind that there would be no real reason to play a warrior at all. Why play a warrior without spells when you can play a warrior with spells.' <P>We will keep that in mind. Remember, the warrior is the basis from which their skills and such are balanced.&gt;&gt; <BR>__________________________________________________<BR>Remember that there are still plenty of reasons to be Warriors: 3x attack, better AC, better, Skills, better Discs, Dual Wield, etc. REMEMBER THIS cuz can most SKs truly land their spells at uber-levels? Not really.<P>NEXT<P>&lt;&lt;'I've been watching the SK talk, and part of the problem there is that an improvement of the SK's defense (and, I'm sure, the Paladin's, when their talk begins) would be an intrusion on the Warrior's role as the ultimate defense. One way to give the SK and Paladin some wiggle room to improve their defense would be to improve the Warrior's defense in tandem.' <P>Actually, even if knights had exactly the same armor class and defensive skills as a warrior, they would be worse tanks, since they have noticeably fewer hit points. As I said earlier, improving warriors would almost by default mean an improvement in those other classes, so that the gap would not close. If we choose to close the gap, then warriors will have to remain where they are. I'm certainly not going to advocate an increase in warrior power _just_ so we can give more power to the hybrids. That seems sorta backward to me.&gt;&gt; <BR>__________________________________________________<BR>WAY TO GO AGAIN! Now you guys are thinking. You are listening to what we are saying and acknowledging what we say to be valid, THANKS!<P>NEXT<P>&lt;&lt;'(More of a general thing) 2h weapons not only do less damage overall, but taunt is laughable. Solution: Warrior hits from 2h Weapons generate 3x the 'taunt' factor of similar 1h damage."&lt;' <P>Interesting idea&gt;&gt;<BR>__________________________________________________<BR>How many Warriors do you see running around w/ 2h? Not many anyway (out of hundreds, upon hundreds). AND Allowing them to become uber-taunts like that will totally mess us up<P>Well thats I'll I got, so next time<P>"Akkuma went to the elder lords and asked 'If my God is so powerful, how can he be slaughtered'"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Few more ideas....<P>1: Sks are damage dealers, not damage takers.  In other words, keep the crappy defensive cap but increase offensive to same level as a warrior.<P>2: SKS should get UNIQUE spells, such as the Shroud line, that are enemy debuffs/self buffs.  The paladins are defensive hybrids, rangers are offensive, so SKs should be the debuffers.  I think someone else already mentioned this, however.<P>3: Drop the pets.  SK pets suck, pure and simple.  I play a level 30 SK as of now, and I never use the pet.  Instead, replace the pet spells with some other line of spells.  Perhaps a line of stamina-leech spells?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The main problem I think with SKs and Pallys-the 2 more defensive hybrids-is that they dont have much to offer at higher levels. They cant tank as well as a warrior, they cant deal dmg as well as a warrior, they have some spells, but none that really makes up for their lacking. The problem is, why would someone choose a Pally or SK over a warrior when warriors can tank AND deal dmg better. If a class is inferior to another in both ways melee-wise they dont have much to offer to a group. Sure pallys get heals and SKs get some offensive spells but if you look at a high level group youll see that SKs and pallys dont have much to offer and there isnt really a reason that they would be wanted to group with as opposed to a warrior.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Although the following post is about hybrids, it addresses the inherent balance issues in general for EverQuest.<P>The problem with warriors -vs- hybrids (not counting bards) is this:<P>If not a single hybrid showed up for an "uber" mob raid in Kunark, or even a non-uber raid in some of the high level Velious zones (and especially the ubers in Velious), the raid can and would still go on, the hybrids would not be missed (if the raid had the needed numbers) and in some encounters (Venril Sathir for example) the hybrids presence would actually HURT the raid, not help it.<P>If not a single warrior showed up for an "uber" mob raid in Kunark, or even a non-uber raid in some of the high level Velious zones (and expecially the ubers in Velious), the raid would not and COULD not continue (even IF the raid had the needed numbers), warriors of the appropriate levels would be solicited from other places by any means possible. No warriors, no raids.<P>This to me is unacceptable. HOW can this be considered 'balanced?' I'm not asking warriors' skills to be reduced. I'm asking hybrids skills, abilities and spells (our spells are difficult at BEST to "stick" to Kunark "boss" mobs or the 56+ mobs in Velious) to be increased so we can be a significant contribution to the raid. Yes, we DO want to be needed. Isn't that what we, as the PEOPLE behind the characters want in game and in real life? Knowing that our presence made a difference, that we helped the group and not hurt it is not only fun, it is very gratifying.<P>For one class of a particular type (fighter/tank/melee or whatever you wanna call us) to be needed EXCLUSIVELY over ALL of the others is very imbalanced.<P>As an analogy, take Diablo II (granted, that is MUCH more of a single player game, but the analogy still applies). Each character class in that game adds their own unique skills and abilities to the game, each would be able to defeat the final "boss" mob on their own, but as a group they would be much more effective, each adding skills the others don't have.<P>Now I'm not asking for each class to have the power and ability to solo boss mobs (or even solo for that matter). For EQ to be a "grouping" game, class interdependency is needed. However, reading the "class talk" boards and hearing the complaints of other classes, and especially with the advent of Velious (mob level and hitpoint cap gone), the only classes that are truly NEEDED are clerics and warriors. And although the other classes do add utility and needed skills, if either one or both of those two "core" classes do not show up for a "raid," the raid wouldn't happen. If one of any other class didn't show up, the raid could still continue. THAT is the fundamental problem with EQ and why many people are losing interest with a particular class or with EverQuest itself. <P>No one wants to be a burden. (well, maybe some people do . . .) But I know I don't. But until I'm given the proper tools, I'll continue to be a burden. This, Verant, I request be changed. How? I don't know. It's your game, you designed it, you control it, you need to decide and implement this change. Otherwise, what are we paying you for?<P>- Vorrek, 52 SK, Quellious<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>After playing an Iksar SK to level 35 and having THE best time of any class around, I guess I have a few things to add. First, and I will say it again, SKs are REALLY fun. You get the melee excitement of a Warrior, but pack that extra punch with spells. Plus you have new spells to look forward to every 10 levels or so. It makes you want to keep playing, just to have that one extra DOT to throw in there. <P>But a few things to change.. give us Voice Graft.. no real gameplay involved with this spell, just roleplaying mainly. Actually I think all pet using classes should get this spell. would lend itself to a lot of good RPing moments.<P>next up, the spell grim aura.. the ATK buffer the necros never use.. let us have this.. would be nice, and since Vamp Embrace doesnt proc a lot anyway, i would use this instead, or in conjunction with Vamp Emb. <P>finally, maybe a reevaluation of pets.. buff em a little? maybe give us the same pets a little earlier? might affect class balance, so could be a bad idea, but at least take a look at this issue<P>thats about it. SKs are still a VERY fun class to play and ill continue to enjoy my great looking Iksar till i cant take anymore  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Heh, I came up with the general idea that basically I'm going to die a lot anyway, so I might as well look good since I can't afford uber armor... yeah, it really sucks not being a twink. "Hey, look it's a dead dark elf... damn best  dressed dead dark elf I ever did see though"<P>Okay...<P>Although it's been said that no one really knows where the cap for peircing came from, this needs to be re-evaluated.  There are some decent piercing weapons out there, which I would like to be able to use - and now days there are weapons such as the velium spear which are basically a piercing version of a long sword.  Without duel weild, shadow knights will not suddenly become unballenced because they can use peircing weapons.<P>I would also like to say we need more USEFUL spells... not neccesarily more powerful.  Say what you will, but I still consider locate corpse to be one of the best spells in the game. And I still like the idea for a ghoul for a pet.<P>Okay, now finally I would like to address this Verant "vision" they keep talking about. I think that Verant doesn't seem to know themselves what this vision of theirs is.  I think the players used to know, but after RoK, and vellios came out, that all got tossed out and only 2 real truthes seem to stand out.  #1 Warriors tank.  #2 Rouges deal damage.  Where does everyone else stand?  I think this is the real problem here. No one is sure anymore because Verant fudged up their own vision.  So here is my impression of the problem at hand.<P>#1 - Warriors: the masters of melee.  Do the most damage (second to rouges), are an essential class for uber mobs.  For some reason they all think they need more hit points... eh.... *shrug*<P>#2 - Rouges: masters of damage.  Always wanted for fighting uber mobs.  Rouges actually seem to have it pretty good although for some reason they can't apply poison to arrows...<P>#3 - Monks: were supposed to be the masters of melee, but for some reason aren't.  Are supposed to be masters of hand to hand combat, but forced to rely on weapons at higher levels.  Are forced to buy weapons, but not allowed to loot anything to save money because of their weight limit.  Now despite Feign death being nearly useless against uber mobs, monks aren't that bad off.  With a little tweaking they could be where they should be for damage - between warriors and rouges.<P>Shadow knights - supposed to exelent damage  dealers (but below all the aforesaid) but aren't.  Get spells which are supposed to help offence but  never do adiquate damage, or are resisted.  Get a pet which is not all that useful. Get a variety of spells that are a down right joke.  Shadow knights should deal the most damage short of warriors, but should come up short on the defensive end.<P>Palidans - the flip side of the coin for shadow knights.  Generally have the same problems too. Paladins should have defensive capabilities slightly below or equal to that of a warrior, but damage less than a shadow knight.<P>Rangers - masters of the bow, but are only as good as warriors with their defining trait weapon.  I'm not overly sure where rangers fit in the heirarchy, but I believe they should be in the middle of shadow knights and paladins in defence and offence.<P>Wizards - supposed to be masters of damage, but have most of their spells highly resisted, and become nothing but a liability once their mana is out.<P>now all the other class may have some issues, but they sort of fit within their nitch as far as I can tell.  Your probably saying that we shouldn't address other peoples problems here, but I think that is the root of the problem - the heirarchy is  totally screwed up.  Rouges and warriors ended up  in the higher end, and everyone else became... in-adiquate (for lack of a better term).  Verant needs to relook at this vision IN THE GAME.  Who cares if you think of paladins using lances, it doesn't matter!  Focus on the game and where the classes IN THE GAME should be IN THE GAME.<P>As an aside I would also like to say that clerics shouldn't have to look at the spell book past level 10 as they stare at it more than anyone else in the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
