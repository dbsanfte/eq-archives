</FONT><HR>I have no writen anything on this post and on the list before so please be kind to me and don't flame.<P>I have a radical idea.<P>Seeing as Verant is so forcefull in making this GAME kill oriented and the preach so much for class balance why dont we mix the best of both worlds. Players want to be equal in capability of warriors as we are basicaly the tank of the caster class. Verant want the class to be challanging enough and not give ubber killing ability.<P>Here is my idea. make wizzards not dependant on mana. in order to achieve this you reduce the damage/agro of the spells to those equivalent of warrior weapons and eliminate the need for mana. to prevent KS and abuse of the class restric the powerfull spells with the delay time. Increase the number of available spells in the world making a wizard spellbook kind of a signature.<P>Just my 2 cents.. Radicall new idea but is just that, an idea...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have a wizard on Morrel Thule server and I was just wondering a few things.<P>1) Does Verant even read this stuff? Much less care what we have to say? Or are we just venting here?<P>2) Do you have problems getting groups? Do people think the wizard class is THAT bad? Most of the groups I have been in are happy if a slag the most annoying in the pack quick and then let the tanks kill the rest. <P>I personally don't have that many issues with the abilities of wizards. More importantly, I feel that any class well-played is better than any class poorly played. As long as you play your given class well, you will get groups. Necros and druids constantly suffer from a kick-ass class being played by a moron player. I find that groups really like it when my wizard hangs back and observes the battle initially, looking for adds and other problems. Then, depending on the group composition, my wizard either a) makes sure healers die or b) pushes mobs into the grave when the get low. Avoiding aggro is critical if you are on evac duty. I have never had any complaints from groups whom I have saved the time and trouble of getting corpses and resses. Properly timed evacs are an important part of playing a wizard. <BR>I don't feel cheated by not being able to do as much raw damage as many other classes over the course of a battle, because I can apply my damage at critical junctures of a battle and swing the battle my group's way. That's what I feel my job is. And besides, teleport is really really cool.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Thanks for listening Absor. And if they only give us one thing on that list I hope it is the % DD. We should get one of these every time new spells are available. Or just one that we get from the beginning. It would be like the main reason for being a wizard. Every class has one defining thing that adds to their appeal. Mages have powerfull pets. Necros have dots and pets. Enchanters get clarity and debuffs. Warriors get massive hps cool armor and weapons. Rangers get tracking, forage and some druid spells. Paladins get lay hands. Shadowknights get harm touch and pets later on. Shamas get sow and can wear better armor than other casters. Plus buffs galore. Clerics heal and can exp res. Rogues get backstab. Druids can kite and turn into a wolf, as well as teleport. Monks get feign death safefall and dont need magical weapons to hit magical mobs. All of these things give their class more apeal. A wizard has nothing to call his own. At least nothing that other classes cant get. Give us %dd nukes from level 1 on up. It only makes sense!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Resists are too high for wizards. Knowing you only have the mana to cast one sigle dd spell per mob and then having that spell be resisted is one of the worst things there is. Resists against greens are also WAY WAY too high. I've had burly gnoles in black burrow (lvl 8ish) resists Ice Comment (49 spell). I've had decaying skeletons (lvl 4ish) resist draught of fire (51 spell). Both those should have such a very low chance of happening as to be virtually impossible for them to happen to the same person. Keep in mind that i don't regularly go around casting IC at gnolls, have only done it maybe a dozen times total, same thing with draughts and decaying skeletons so to get those two resists is pretty bad. <P>Higher greens resist even worse. Why a lvl 35 mob can resist a lvl 60 spell cast by a lvl 60 wizard is beyond me yet it happens all the time. Where is the mastery we just spent the last 60 levels achieving if we can be resisted by such low creatures. Where the idea of resists came from in the first pace i have no idea. I've certainly never ready about them in any fantasy literature i've ever seen. If the spell is cast correctly then it does what its suppose to unless another caster is there to oppose and divert it. DON'T tell me decaying skeletons have the magical power to divert Ice Comment, they aren't even casters and even if they were they'd never be able to handle the power of the spell.<P>I don't belive our innate resist debuff is working properly, or at least isn't enough even if it is working. Since my wiz is 60 i've taken to playing an enchanter and i can honestly say he can slow red cons with more certainty then my wizard can nuke blues, Thats just wrong!<P>Mysthyl</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sinneed, Very god sugestions about letting oters ingroup get our damage report as well. The mana aura would be very wonderful to see in game, but even with out it, maybe an additional line in the health bar, like the one in the ep bar, that showed the mana of each caster would subsitute untill that change could be made. And lastly I get all giddy thinking about Paralizing Earth being AE Root. But it would need to be a differnt spell, due that many non AE casters get it as well. I have wondered why we did not have an AE root. Talk about group friendly, can you imagine when you get trained and you cast one AE root so your group can get to saftey with out haveing to EVAC 30 minutes away.<P>Ertye Novastorm <BR>nameless wizard 51</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan, I'm glad that you're still with us really appreciate it *smiles*<P>Quote: "I’m listening. Make some suggestions. But there’s a caveat. Do it without turning the wizard into one of the other classes (I’ve seen requests for massive crowd control...)."<P>My view: Well we get DS, DDs, AoEs from the mages (or is it the other way around heh?), aren't we ALREADY one of the other classes? Is it true that giving us some group spells a really bad idea? Right now we share all our spells with other classes, we are not unique at all. We get some spells from the mages, ports from the druids, then a pet at lvl 60.<P>The idea brought up by Rikochet sounds interesting: Since we are the seekers of knowledge thus we know how to cast spells effeciently with lower mana cost. "This line of buffs would lower the mana cost of *evocation-based* spells for both the wizard and group members."<P>Quote: "Evaks and damage are what wizards bring to a group"<P>My view: Right on, evacs and damage are what wizards are about but our ports are so dangerous and we can't port to those places until we are high lvl enough. Moreoever, I thought evacs were supposed to take you away from danger instead of leanding in the middle of a bunch of blue mobs *chuckles*<P>ITEM: Lvl 39 spell - Lighting Shock got resisted way too often. I am currently lvl 42 and I went to Najena with my friend, my Lighting Shock was resisted by a greenie Bonecracker.<P>ITEM: Is being able to cast a few seconds faster an advantage or a death trap? We can't chain nuke anyways unless our spells have lower aggro than other classes.<P>ITEM: The root-line spells aren't reliable my immobilize doesn't even last long vs greenies.<P>ITEM: Nothing was mentioned about the sight-line spells (i.e. gaze, shifting sight etc) because of the use of clipping plane, these spells are currently broken. Is there any plan to give us some other useful spells because I don't think you can fix the sight-line spells at all?<P>Alan, again thanks for sticking with us. I have to agree with you that if you guys canfind ways to make wizards more efficient with our ability to blow stuff up, then we will become wanted hopefully. Some ways to make us last longer during a battle would be great. Thanks for reading, I know your eyes hurt *smiles*<P>Cirea<BR>Lvl 42 Wizard </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I'm gonna repeat my idea for a group friendly spell and use numbers this time.  I really like this idea and I'd like to hear a reason it couldn't be implemented.<P>We are the masters of offensive magic right?  Does anyone dispute this?  So why not give us the proc spells that can be cast on others.  Sort of a reverse mage damage shield.  Here are some numbers:<P>Ok, at my level (58) a mage can cast Cadaeu of Flame on a tank for 155 mana.  The spell lasts 6 minutes and does 33 damage everytime the tank is hit.  Now, in a small group with one main tank fighting giants in Kael (or other velious mobs with lots of hps) a warrior will take 40-50 hits in the course of a fight.  That is at least 1500 damage for 155 mana.  That is 10:1.  That is efficiency.  Why can't we have the same efficiency on one of our spells?<P>For instance, at the same level give wizards Fists of Fury (obviously you'd come up with a real name) that can be cast on tanks for 200 mana.  Give the spell similar durations to the damage shields (for this level, 6 minutes).  During that time, the spell gives the fighter a chance to proc an additional damage spell.  Let's say the fighter swings his weapons once per second (not unreasonable with the haste nowadays).  So if the spell gives him a percentage to proc 5% of the time, he will proc 3 times per minute.  So that is 12 procs on average for the 6 minute duration of the spell and it would need to proc for about 125 damage per hit.  Even then, it would be less efficient than mage damage shields.<P><BR>Hypothetical...<P>Spell:  Fists of Flame.<BR>Level:  56<BR>Duration: 6 min<BR>Mana: 200<BR>Target:  any PC<BR>Effect:  Gives the tank a 5% chance to proc a 125 damage fire DD.<P><BR>Of course there are things to consider like what is the damage based on (fire, magic, cold) and there could be a version that did no damage but procced a stun, or some that had lousy ratios but were lure based.  If no one at Verant wants to come up with spells and ratios for each level I'd be happy to  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>What is wrong with this idea?  How would this unbalance us?  It would let tanks taunt, it would let us damage mobs over super long fights, it would let us help groupmates!  It would give us efficient forms of damage to match pet classes but without stealing anyone else's abilities.<P>I just don't see why you keep ignoring this idea.  Is it just too much work?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I was playing with my L40 cleric friend yesterday and just loved his Atone spell (wipes you from hate list).<P>Since wizards are so mana dependent, i wish we had something like this. So many times I use up a bubble or two of mana just to get something off me that aggroed on me while medding. Then I have to med some more adding even more downtime. An 'atone' type spell would certainly help reduce a wizards downtime. Even if I could only Atone green mobs, it would be great.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Thanks Absor/Alan for taking the time to balance us out.  I think you hit a great number of important issues.  <BR>While all of the issues you hit are nice I hope you focus on the mana efficiency/regeneration area.  I know you have heard all the arguments for and against so I won't bore you with my opinions on the matter.  But this is the one improvement that we simply must have.  While pets and melees fight and while clerics heal we sit and wait and wait and wait.  It is very frustrating especially in groups making continuous pulls, and without breeze/clarity -- forget it. PLEASE have some significant changes made here -- if that is the only improvement we get -- I would be much more satisfied.<P>The only other comment I would like to make is another you've heard.  Please don't nerf out Bonds of Force -- it is one of the few unique offensive tools we have (well wizzies and druids anyway) It is quite possilbly the only tool that makes soloing as a wizzy EVER productive.  It is not an unfair spell.  It takes skill to get it right aside from multiple kiting, quad-kiting is even more difficult since the columns only hit three mobs, you have to be close up for any of our AoE's to hit 4 mobs and do much dmg at all.  I really like the spell and at level 31 I still haven't truly gotten the hang of using it regularly on more than two mobs.  All considering -- it is a great spell and with all our disadvantages (compared to healers, melees, and pet casters) this spell really helps out.  Please keep it the way it is (and not being able to snare your whole group would be nice by the way).<P>Thanks,<BR>Molstaf Azurewrath <BR>Wizard of 31 Seasons<BR>Co-leader of Syndicate of Light<BR>Tallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wizards get a quest in the Temple of Solusek Ro for a staff that debuffs the target by 10 in cold and fire resistance when right-clicked. This item is not easy to get, is no drop, and is MINIMALLY useful. I think the following should be done to make this item better, and to help balance wizards.<BR>1) Make the debuff scale with level (meaning starts at 10 for the level it begins to proc, then goes up from there. Say, maybe it would do 20 at level 50, and 40 at level 60)<BR>2) Add a MAGIC debuff to it as well. Right now, we have cold and fire on it, but we NEED magic too. (This would help out enchanters in our groups as well)<BR>3) Make the debuff STACK with ALL other class debuffs.<P>*** If none of these can be done to the current staff, then I propose a new quest be implemented that requires the current staff as a component. This quest could upgrade our Staff of Temperate Flux to a "Staff of Flux" that would have the features I listed. Right now, wizards are severely lacking in quests. This quest could be made in a sort of "epic" style where you have many small "side-quests" to complete along the way. One thing to point out is that it should be NO more time consuming to complete than the original SoTF quest. (i.e. Don't let whoever made the Staff of the Four quest have ANY input on this quest) <P>I would also like to see an upgraded 1hB staff with stats similar to the Staff of the Wheel. Perhaps the quest could be as follows:<P>1) Get Staff of Temperate Flux<BR>2) Get Staff of the Wheel<BR>3) Do a new quest that ends in a NPC combining the Staff of the Wheel and Staff of Temperate Flux with something else to create a....<P>Staff of Flux:<BR>1hB, 10dmg/40del, +10 INT, +10 HP, +10 MANA, +5 VS COLD, +5 VS FIRE, +5 VS MAGIC, (Gives off light of Greater Light Stone), Effect: AuraFlux<P>AuraFlux lowers target's magic/cold/fire resist by 10, and is insta-cast like jboots and current SoTF.<P>I don't think adding the magic resist debuff should be "overpowering", and I certainly don't see a problem of raising the debuff by a few extra points. Remember that the Staff of the Wheel quest is hard, and the Staff of Temperate Flux quest is HARD. Adding a THIRD quest which requires both staves as components as well as other tasks should balance this item. Also note that the stats on the final staff are just a combination of the stats on SoTF and SoTW with the addition of 5 sv magic.<P>For comparison:<P>Current Staff of Temperate Flux:<BR>1hB, 6/30, +5 vs cold/fire, Effect: LowerElement<P>Current Staff of the Wheel:<BR>1hB, 10/100, 10 INT, 10 HP, 10 MANA, (Gives off a little less light than GLS)<P>So, what do you think, Absor? Could you please pass this idea along to the questmasters?<P>Forgot to add that the AuraFlux effect should stack with ALL other debuffs like Malosi, Tashania, etc. <P>If it gets a distinctive graphic (which it SHOULD since melees have about 50000 different weapon graphics, but casters have about 3), it should NOT have ANY kind of stupid SKULL on it!!! I'm thinking it should have a shimmering ball on top, sort of like the Icecream Cone of the Mystics, but a little smaller. Perhaps it should have some kind of ornament on the bottom as well, and maybe the staff portion should have some decorations in its texture.<P>Oh well. I can dream, right?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Have you considered the following for "fixing" wizard West Karana portal and adding new wizard and druid spots. (Do not forget that our description lists us as masters of teleportation, so forget the part about "druids should have more ports than us")<BR>Here is solution:<BR>There is NO need to rebuild the zone geometry. Remember the "rude individual" dynamic situation in Qeynos Hills and Qeynos? I don't remember those shacks being around before that, especially the one in front of Blackburrow. Those shacks are not part of the "zone geometry", just like the portal to Sleeper's Tomb and the flower that leads to PoG. Those items are world objects that can be added and removed at will. All that needs to be done is for some kind of thingy to be added wherever the teleport spot is moved to.<P>I personally think it would be cool to have something like the entrance to Sleeper's Tomb added to WK for our portal destination. That would be neat <P>I would like to see new portal spots added to Qeynos Hills or Everfrost for us. Here are my suggested "new" wizard teleport locations:<P>1) Everfrost<BR>2) Qeynos Hills<BR>3) The Arena (Druids should get this too)<BR>4) *** Move the Cazic Gate to a point just outside (in Feerrot)<BR>5) PLANE OF FEAR!!! (The spell was in-game for a while, but when PoF opened it was removed)<BR>6) Erud's Crossing, Ocean of Tears, and Timorous Deep (Druids should get these too)<BR>7) Firiona Vie or Lake of Ill Omen<BR>8) The Overthere or Warsliks Woods<BR>9) REMOVE the "Kunark dungeon-only restriction" from Tishan's and Markar's Relocation (make them work from ANYWHERE)<BR>10) Steamfront (Gnomish wizards would DEFINITELY have put up a teleport spot)<P>Anyway, these are just my suggestions of some things that need to be looked at. As for druid spots, I leave that up to them to suggest.<P>The Ghoul Arch Magus has spoken  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cool.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This post addresses the balancing issue of damage amount, mana efficiency, and damage over time.  It is a simple set of examples of what Grimstaff and others refer to as increasing the wizard's damage potential. Its final section deals with grouping.<P>To illustrate what I mean, I would like to compare the stats for the level 49 Ice Comet and level 51 Draught of Fire spells.  As a level 52 wizard, I use DoF as my primary spell because it exemplifies the concepts of fast damage and mana efficiency.<P>The Draught of Fire stats are:<BR>-----------------------------------------<BR>Decrease Hit Points (HP) from 643 to 688<BR>Range to Target: 200 feet<BR>Mana Required: 215<BR>Casting Time: 3.0 seconds<BR>Spell Recovery: 2.25 seconds<BR>-----------------------------------------<P>The Ice Comet stats are:<BR>-----------------------------------------<BR>Decrease Hit Points from 1110 to 1120<BR>Range to Target: 200 feet<BR>Mana Required: 400<BR>Casting Time: 6.30 seconds<BR>Spell Recovery: 2.50 seconds<BR>-----------------------------------------<P>Fast Damage<BR>-----------<BR>You can see from the stats that a wizard can cast five DoF spells in about the same amount of time that it takes to cast three IC spells.  That adds up to 3460 DoF damage to 3360 IC damage over about 26 seconds.<P>But what is far more important, is that a wizard can cast DoF more often ... once every 5.25 seconds for DoF versus once every 8.80 seconds for IC.<P>The fast reaction time of the DoF spell makes it a preferred spell in a group because it can hit a mob more often which is what wizards are supposed to do.<P>The Ice Comet spell loses here because of its long cast and recovery times.<P>The conclusion is that wizards need more spells with short cast and recovery times; not more spells with long cast and recovery times.<P>Mana Efficiency<BR>---------------<BR>This one is simple also.  The DoF spell ratio for damage versus mana (688/215 = 3.2) is much better than the Ice Comet ratio (1120/400 = 2.8).<P>The DoF spell ratio in its initial form (643/215 = 2.99...) is still slightly better than the IC ratio in its final form.<P>The Ice Comet spell loses again because it uses 400 mana to cast for 1120 damage where the DoF spell uses 430 mana for 1296 damage (2x casts).<P>The conclusion is that wizards need more mana efficient spells as we achieve levels. <P>Damage Over Time<BR>----------------<BR>This section is for the Uber-Mobs in Velious where wizards run out of mana long before the Uber-Mob is dead.  If you compare the DoF spell cast time to the IC spell cast time, you can see that a wizard can sit for 3.75 seconds between DoF casts.<P>This changes the damage amount in favor of the IC spell because the DoF spell does 2064 damage over 26 seconds where the IC spell does 3360 damage.<P>You would think that the IC spell has an advantage here; however, the wizard has lost 1200 mana casting the IC spell compared to a loss of 645 mana casting the DoF spell.  And the wizard gets to sit for 11.25 seconds per three cast cycle recovering mana.<P>If you carry this analogy out far enough, you can see that the IC spell will eventually lose because the wizard has no time to recover mana; he will run out of mana; therefore, he must sit and meditate.<P>The DoF spell, however, uses about half the mana and gives the wizard time to sit and meditate between casts.<P>The conclusion is that wizards need highly mana efficient spells with very low cast and recovery times to be useful against any Uber-Mob.<P>Summary<BR>-------<BR>Short cast and recovery times are good for wizards; long cast and recovery times are bad.<P>Mana efficiency is good for wizards because the more mana efficient a spell is, the more damage it does per cast; hence, the more damage it will do over time.<P>Short cast and recovery times provide more time for wizards to sit and meditate between casts.  High mana efficiency provides lower mana usage which reduces the time a wizard must sit and meditate.  This combination allows us to fight the Uber-Mobs.  Anything else is bad.<P>Increasing mana efficiency per spell makes changing our mana recovery rate a moot point.  There has to be a balance between the pool size, its usage, and its recovery rate.<P>Group Friendly<BR>--------------<BR>Before I start this section, I should like to say that I agree with Grimstaff and Absor ... a wizard's primary jobs are fast damage and evacs (or portals).<P>If the wizard class is properly balanced with all the wizard bugs removed from the resistant mobs, the wizard can be the "heavy artillery" of any group once again.<P>That should be enough to make our class "group friendly".  If it isn't, then wizards can make their own groups ... two tanks, one cleric, one enchanter and two wizards, or three wizards depending on the mobs and location.<P>The most efficient group I have ever been in for gaining experience had no meleers and no clerics in it.  It consists of an enchanter, a mage, and me ... the wizard.  The enchanter pulled, I snared, the mage pet rooted and we all blasted.<P>We started in The Overthere; then the Dreadlands (we needed tanks for the Dread Widow); we are in Burning Woods now; last will be SkyFire and the Kunark dungeons.<P>And then on to Velious ... with more wizards, I hope. *smile*<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Balance Issue:<BR>Wizards on Raids.<P>Absor, I know you want to skim, but this post is something I believe important, and so I will add as much background as I can.<P>I am a 52 Channeler, and have been on raids from Dalnir to Fear to Kael.  I am frequently placed in “caster” groups.  This is because of the way wizard hp totals work, and only a secondary healer is required to keep wizards alive. Either the shaman can heal me up, or not. Either way, CH would take too long so clerics are better left with warriors. <P>Tanks chanters and clerics are in their own groups (frequently with rogues).  They’re “tank” or “melee” groups.  The split of these two types of groups is extraordinarily commonplace, and so I have a feeling that every caster class knows what I am talking about.<P>Typically there are 3 tank groups and 2 caster groups on big raids, the number can vary quite a bit, but typically not by more than +/- 2 groups. <P>Whenever we kill things on raids, the caster group never gets xp.  What? Never? No. Never. I would like to state right off the bat that it is NOT because we are outdamaged.  Frequently we’re killing things with 10k hp.  Two wizards casting ice comets can pump out 4.4k dmg themselves in 16 seconds.  Being in a group with all casters means that the mage is tossing out dmg, the necro is dotting, and the shaman is dotting, not to mention pets.  In total a caster group easily does 60% of the damage to a given monster.  <P>There is often more than one caster group in a raid, which puts the melee groups totals even lower since a given monster is not alive for more than 16 seconds.    <P>However, when the mob falls, the xp does NOT go to the group that has done the most damage… something is very very wrong.  It goes to one of the melee groups, the caster damage is wholly ignored when divvying up xp for slayings on raids involving multiple groups.<P>Another example:<P>I was in a pseudo-caster group with 2 wizards, druid, shaman, ranger and shadow knight.  We were fighting a spite golem (totally immune to magic, unless lures are used—even then 50% resists).  The wizards were at the time 51, and so we relied totally on the shadow knight and ranger to do damage.  The SK tossed out a HT, did some melee and the ranger went to it, and lo and behold, we got xp!  It was unexplainable, we got the xp even though there were other melee heavy groups, and caster groups in the raid. <P>In all of my post-46 levels, I have only gotten xp if there was a melee class in my group on a raid, even if my group does 50% of the total damage in a 5 group raid (we do 50%, the others do like 12.5% each). <P>Absor, I believe xp assignments are broken in raid situations.  Please please please look into this.  This could be another reason why groups don’t value wizards, because their damage is not added to the xp calculator, and therefore ignored somehow.  <P>Fellow wizards, feel free to back me up because I know you’ve all seen this happen multiple times. <P>Sawz Emenhaf<BR>52nd channeler of the SP<BR>The Tribunal<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One note about the quad kiting issue.  I'm not sure who all these guys posting that it is so dangerous and time consuming are...quad kiting post 50 is by far the best way to get xp, period.  If you have jboots and pick the right spot to do it in, there is no risk (except for linkdeath).  Those people who keep telling you how dangerous it is are either newbies (we don't have the efficient spells at low levels) or else have too slow of a connection to do it properly.<P>However, this really doesn't seem like a balance issue to me.  Sure, the xp is great, but pet classes and druids have gotten crazy xp throughout their careers.  Who cares if wizards are the kings of xp for a few brief levels post 50?  And there is no loot to be made in this...just xp.  Also, it is increadibly dull!  That is why you don't see everyone doing it.  I only did it myself when I had a couple hours during which I would be mostly afk.<P>I think that hits on another major problem with wizards.  We do everything too fast and inefficiently.  I can drain a full load of mana in under a minute, and then I have 10 minutes of sitting on my butt doing nothing.  It almost seems that you designed wizards to be an afk class.<P>Which is why many of us keep pleading for some group friendly abilities and single target efficient spells.  Because we have none currently, we get efficiency the only way we can...by killing 4 things at once.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alan, I see your responses so I know you are at least reading our posts, thannk you for that. I hope you can see what the rest of us do the one underlying theme here is mana/damage and efficiancy (sp?) I can stretch out my manna in a fight to last for several mobs by being careful when/what I cast and thats OK you need to know HOW to play a wizard thats part of it. Then though I am OOM and it takes forever to med up even with clarity. We need more efficient spells, more manna, and faster manna regen. Giving us a %DD is a great idea but if it only works in Velious then it really is only a bone being thrown. The problems with Wizards did not begin with Velious or even Kunark so please don't use this as the only measure on these issues. AE's also are simply not the answer and never will be, try going into any high lvl dungeon on a raid AE's get the party killed usually even if you know how to use them, so AE's really are not going to help us there are not many places you can use them now. (Might be nice if mez'd mobs were immune to spells same as charmed mobs, that would help in situations in dungeons and not get the enchanters killed) This Kind of change would be nice but far from fixiing the problem. If you don't want to increase the damage of spells thats fine, I tend to do better in battles useiing the fast cast medium damage spells that I get post 50 anyway they are easy to time so you don't agro the mob. The problem is we are OOM way to fast and it takes us way to long to recover. If you address those two issues you will have so many beers coming from all us wizzy's that you would be drunk for the next 30 years. PLEASE don't throw us bones FIX the root of the problem don't just throw bones to treat the symptoms.<P>Thanks<BR>Quindinar lvl 55 Wizard Tarrew Marr :smokin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>first I want to thank absor for responding.<BR>second I have some thoughts:<P>1. no one uses the al kabor line of spells. no one. <P>2. I have issues with root/enstill/immobilze..<BR>I was grouped with my friend (56 druid) last night hunting in Wakening Lands. He would snare, root and dot. if I were to shoot or otherwise affect the mob his ensnaring root would break and the sentient armor pounds on me. When his root breaks naturally I attempted to immobilze it. <BR>the immobilize lasted less than a tick, and automatically overwrites/prevents the druid root line. Not just once but over and over again. until he told me to sit on the hill and wait till the armor went to snared-run mode. then I could throw my mana away at the crippled mob... hello, how demeaning is this? (and this is my friend, most players would throw you out of a group for being this ineffective)<P>3. I would like to be able to use harvest to stun myself and give mana back to a targeted player, much in the same way necro's can twitch. I dont see how this harms anyone and it allows me to pretend I'm usefull while I sit on the hill and wait for the mob to turn to run.<P>4. Can we lose the damage shields all together? <BR>I'm the laughing stock of the group everytime I cast one.<P>5.I like the ideas of critical hits...<P>6.I *Love* the ideas of yonder removing from the hate list or lowering agro.<P>7.The skyfire gate is utterly suicide for those of us that zone slowly, never even getting to see what killed you... Can we trade this in for a gate to FV, or overthere, or trak's teeth?<P>8.I have come to accept the uselss spells (magnify,glimpse,eye of zom,heatsight...etc) as comic relief. and they all fit nicely in the back of the spell book.<P>9.What I *Really* want to see for a new spell is a reverse translocate. a summon like call of hero's only multi-zone. Just have a way to type in someones name and give them a yes/no box like for rez or sacrafice. <P>10. *drool* % based dd... yummy that means I might get into a velketors group now...<P>11. Can we get a dot? even a particularly bad one? We get a few low level bolts (magician specialty), I would like a dot (around level 39) maybe something like drones of doom? <P><BR>ok I guess thats about it.<BR>anyone else shared my poor experiences?<BR>or think I am way out of line?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P>Angelisa Angelfire<BR>The Arcane Order<BR>Mith Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!! I LOVE YOU ABSOR! The  ideas you have posted are great! I love them all!<P>I only have 3 suggestions which would make Wizards what we really should be.<BR>1. Make "Eye of Zoom" not aggro on mobs, this would help us look around corners without pulling a train on us  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>2. I like the idea of Percentage damage spells, and adding more DD spells. I only ask of you is to increase how much damage the DD spells do, make them more powerful.<BR>3. Make some teleportation spells which evac the target (which has to be in your group). <BR>4. Also make Teleport spells to ALL of the Planes, this would make us more useful in a plane raid.<BR>5. Keep Invisibility vs Undead, we need it.<BR>6. Root line of spells MUST last longer. They rarely hold for how much time they are suppose to and one cast on them and it breaks.<P>Also i would like to say, i love the mana regeneration increased idea, the "Blink" line of spells, percentage damage spells, at the Critical Hits on spells. I would love these things!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>Thx for your time<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>To Absor,<P>Hi again  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I just wanted to let you know what is also  really bad about our spells too. Its true we are defined by our magical damage but as our levels spells increase, there is nothing to support our increased lvls with utility spells. For instance, a druid can use snare effectively that uses 15 mana or a chanter using tashana, i forgot the mana since last I played my alt but I think its like 20 , and these spell are used effectively at 50+ lvl.<P>I remember one day when I was fighting the dino in OOT and we got our 30 lvl chanter friend to debuff the dino and guess what? He never got a resist with that spell. The dino is lvl 50 to begin with and for a 30 lvl chanter to cast a debuff like that was cool but I felt cheated since I was 50 lvl that time and got lots of resists still. Is a 30 lvl spell supposed to be that much better than a 49  one? I just wanted to know who decides what spells get no resist. That was the problem you had with druid snare, they didn't have to use up 75mana for snare like we do. I'm not here demanding utility spells like they had in the past but a wizard has no utility spells except for see invisible/invisible but that doesn't help in a group killing a mob. And by utility, I'm talking about ways to help in a group. I heard mages get low hp regen and ac increase on armor besides some of the spells we have with them in armor ac??<BR>Thanks for listening,<P>Pluto</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, by now everyone's posted their two cents, might as well add mine.<P>Please don't mess with our snare spells, save to reduce the fizzle rate of Atol's.  The snare is more powerful then a druid snare of equivolent level, and the AE componant is nice for when being chased by multiple mobs.   If you make bonds of force single target, then up the duration to 12 minutes and cut the mana cost by 1/4th.<P>Multi-kiting is fine as is, please leave it alone.  (Aka:  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Absor, wizards spent 50 levels as the worst of the "soloist" classes...let us have our 10 levels of glory.)<P>Look into the Eye of Tallon, lvl 57 spell, it doesn't invis itself properly, and often despawns when you click on it.<P>Otherwise, you listed basically everything that really needs to be confronted.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think the biggest problems are being looked at.  Mana efficency and resists. <P>The Lure line needs to be addressed, the strength of these spells comes in raids on high level mobs such as dragons and new kunark and velious mobs.  These spells are resisted too often and with the increase of HP to the new velious mobs we are not as effective in raid situations.  <P>Somehow the lure line needs to be more effective on the new high HP mobs. We are already one of the last classes considered for a group, we don't want to lose our fire power in a raid. <P>If (a) percentage damage spell(s) was added it would only be effective for groups or soloing unless it was part of the lure line and in that case it would be effective only in raids since the mana efficiency would go down as a penalty for less resists. So I think if you add a spell like this to say the draught line you also need to add one to the lure line. If i were to pick which line of spells I wanted a spell like this added to it would diffentely be the lure line.<P>Making us more mana efficient is an excellent way to make us more group friendly, another thing that would be good is give us a high level single target snare spell.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

This ability would scale similar to the group experience bonus, and would allow a wizard to contribute more in larger groups.<P>Things that could be scaled based on number of people in the wizard’s group:<BR>		<BR>1. Decreased mana cost for certain spells, based on group size.<BR>2. Decreased resistance for certain spells, based on group size. <BR>3. Decreased casting time for certain spells, based on group size.<BR>4. Increased maximum damage for certain spells, based on group size.<BR>5. Increased mana regeneration rate, based on group size.<P>If any or all of these were implemented, a wizard would become a more valuable member of a group, while not increasing solo capability in any way. <P>Verant has once stated that they were interested in ideas about wizards “chain casting” spells between one more casters to encourage grouping. This idea is similar.<P>---------------------------<P>This scaleability could even be further customized both for number of people in a group as well as the kinds of classes (for instance, more fighter-types could improve damage ability; more caster types could lower resistance, etc.). This could also be scaled against the relative size of the opponent. (Bigger opponents = bigger benefit).<P>There were a number of similar posts throughout the Wizard discussion along these lines. Many good ideas have been put forth, designed to make the wizard a desired companion, particularly on high-level raids.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>RE: Z-Axis AEs<P>Absor said: "Really? Odd. I would think if this was a problem it would be a problem for all classes with those spells. And, as far as I can remember, you’re the only person to mention this in any of these threads. Does anyone else have this problem?"<P>House of Unrest had problems with AE mez, and Kedge Keep also. I think Plane of Air does too but no one would ever let me try  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  Seems to be a general problem with how "thick" floors are. Mistmoore always seemed to have the same problem with casters seeing you through walls and such.<P>RE: Casting speed & Efficiency<BR>Absor said: "Maybe. But it’s not really unbalanced as it is. The fact that there are a few spells that cast fast really can’t be considered unbalancing. And this is also sort of covered in the Spell Efficiency thing. Doing a lot of damage in 6 seconds is still faster than doing less damage in 4 seconds..."<P>Well, not sure what the original poster was referring to but I think what needs to be addressed is that some of our biggest nukes takes a lot of time (Sunstrike\Ice Comet). But the catch is that the dmg/second is sorta low. Take Ice Comet for example: 1120dmg/6sec cast time == 186dmg per second. But this is misleading because you also have a 2 sec hold time on casting anyways, so the dmg/sec falls to about 131dmg/sec- or about 30% more than a rogue who doesnt need mana in the first place.<P>RE: Lure Efficiency<BR>Absor said: "For less resistance, you get less efficiency. That’s how it works, and it makes sense."<P>It was a good spell line, but lately I have a couple issues. First off, the max dmg from lures is irrelevent in SoV as you may know. In Kunark, melees can almost stay up with me on the dmg because there are still resists on lures at least once on a full mana burn. It might be worth considering that these are spells to make wizards useful on Ubermob encounters. Watering the dmg down to melee levels more or less defeats the need for lures and a wizard when melees are much more reliable than mana users. But thanks for making us considered for raids rather than our spot going to any pet class  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>RE: AE variety<BR>Absor said: "Well, I disagree. I like the idea that players need to find new ways to do things, that they have to learn to use new spells every on occasion."<P>Almost 2/3 of our spell book are in fact AEs. We get 12 (think I counted right) AEs 51+ and 5 regular DDs. AE is the wiz trademark.<P>RE: Group usefulness<BR>Absor said: "Evaks and damage are what wizards bring to a group, and I think that should be enough, if it’s all working right."<P>Course we get no evacs for SoV and 1 of the 2 we get for Kunark is basically insta death. It might be interesting to look at making more port spots for SoV and Kunark based around the key idea (Assuming the # of keys problem is fixed) and requiring people to adventure there and not have to waste 2hrs a night repeating the same journey. And then the faction problems with 2 of hte 3 portals also is something else.<P>Whining maybe. But as a porting class these changes have really crimped that aspect of our usefulness.<P><BR>Alcheon of Prexus<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Time for more talk on the same items, just to make sure the correct approach gets read.<P>&gt; At the end of this I hope you all do one simple calculation at each level:<BR>&gt; Wizard (the pure caster) Damage output over 10 minutes of combat.<BR>&gt; EQUALS<BR>&gt; Warrior (the pure melee) Damage output over 10 minutes of combat.<P>No, friend.  Think about it for a while, or read more of the thread.  Warrior damage is not the goal.  Warriors tank, and for that they do only about half the damage of THE pure melee class in the game (Rogues).  Wizards need to be bumped up to where they match Rogues.  If Wizards = Warriors for damage, they will still have the same exact problem they do currently.  Nobody will take "X damage" over "X damage plus the best tanking in the game".<P>&gt; Well, here's the deal, Wizards have been told over and over they are about fast damage, that being outdamaged over time is no big deal because we do it fast and furious.<P>I'm not saying Grimstaff is making this up but Absor needs to tread very carefully around this issue.  In most of the standard Kunark and Velious raid / grind scenarios, a Wizard's maximum damage output isn't enough to kill a single mob.  This will never be significantly altered.  Therefore, it basically goes without saying that the Wizardly ability to do fast damage is reduced to the point of no longer being a worthwhile consideration.<P>This is not as bad as it sounds.. but it IS unavoidable, because the alternative is to give Wizards the capacity for doing 50,000+ damage in a hurry to two or three mobs.  Or one.  This will not happen.<P>The only thing wrong with Wizards losing fast damage is that it serves to make the #1 problem with the class (inefficiency) more obvious.<P>&gt; I have seen many excellent suggestions on making harvest an ability that scales as levels increase<P>Again I must stress that forcing a Wizard (or any magic user, for that matter) to juggle his mana bar every X minutes just to enjoy efficiency that should have been his in the first place is NOT a solution that would (or does) go over well with anyone.<P>&gt; Blowing things up faster does NOT make us group friendly.<P>Too bad you feel that way, friend.  If you want to be group friendly, it really doesn't take that long to twink up a Necromancer.  And to bluntly refute your statement above... Would meleeing things to death twice as fast make a Warrior more group friendly?  I suppose it depends on how you define "group friendly", but for me, the term means "desirable in a group", and the answer is "absolutely".  Enter the Rogue.  He sacrifices a Warrior's tanking for the absolute domination of the melee field (and I'm not talking about just a small hair better than Warriors, either).<P>Absor, you know the answer, and like you've already said, Wizards don't need to become other classes before they can start being useful.<P>&gt; Resists are so bad, I end up switching to lure of flame. Lures on a green mob!<BR>&gt; It takes me about 11 min to med to full, so that is 6k damage per 11 min. My warrior companion does 6k damage per mob!<P>Just thought I would highlight these bits from Gherad's post.  They are definitely items that raise the ol' eyebrow.  SoV greenies and resists.  Bad in Skyshrine, even bad in the upper levels of Tower of Frozen Shadow.  And of course the second quote shows just how far out of whack Wizard damage is compared to Warrior damage.. NOT EVEN the pure melee class (Rogue) who has twice the output of a Warrior!  And it's important to note, as I have been trying to make perfectly clear from the start, AE's are absolutely, positively NOT an option in the above scenario.  Don't even BEGIN to examine them as a solution.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OK you people won't go to a distinct web page to read some more on the topic, and it doesn't matter if there's a bit more logorrheia on the message board, so here's my answer for each item (sorry for referring to some of my web pages, but these references are LINKS in my original text; by the way I don't think that the item of "group friendly" should be added):<P>ITEM: Increased mana regeneration.<BR>Obviously this is meant to help play in full group, NOT to help Wizards kill tough mobs in solo. I doubt that the problem is severe (I just added my analysis of the topic in my page on exciting Wizard fighting, point 3), but it could be solved by means of an automatical mana regeneration bonus in group, working the same way than the experience bonus. And/or there could be a mana regeneration bonus in dungeons (not necessarily the same for each dungeon; the experience bonus per dungeon can be a guideline). Typically, a Wizard will solo only outdoors, not in a dungeon, because there's not enough room to kite, and Root bombing is unreliable (actually, Druids, who are supposed to be "masters of the outdoors", solo better than Wizards in dungeons, thanks to Root dotting, which is more reliable than Root bombing).<P>ITEM: Spell efficiency.<BR>Except for the comparison with Magicians, this item is essentially the same as the previous one. Personally I don't mind if my DD spells are only about 10% more potent than the Magician DD spells, as long as they are quicker, and I have personal defense spells which Magicians don't have, and exclusive and superior AE damage to compensate for the absence of a pet. The quality of our AE damage is a problem, but that's what my site is all about, so I won't try to summarize it in a few words here. I have another idea for the famous "massive monster" problem, which was felt in Kunark already, but it might require too much programming: the Wizard DD spells could "resonate" with higher-than-average life energy, and produce increased effects when the mob's "hit point / level" ratio is above certain values. However, I guess that the NAMED RARE SPAWNS in Velious were made with high hit points specially to avoid people killing them solo, so, again, the reality of the problem is uncertain. Note that the outdoor solo capabilities of Wizards were made substantially higher, when Root and Snare became stackable (the mana regeneration, even taking into account the mana spent to maintain the mob Rooted and Snared, tends to be higher than the mob hit point regeneration), and I feel I can take on mobs bigger than before.<P>ITEM: Percentage Damage Spells.<BR>Why not. There was such a spell in old Diablo, it was called "Bone spirit" (it took away 1/3 of a mob's hit points). Forcibly, the hate-building would be a fixed amount, regardless of how many hit points were removed (spells in general create a fixed amount of aggro, regardless of the results); but here, to obtain maximum results, there is a temptation to use the spell very early in the fight, creating an interesting dilemma regarding the timing of the cast... still, I believe that such spells would open the door to endless game balance issues (they could be too powerful on Dragons and Gods, etc).<P>ITEM: Level Cap on spells.<BR>Ooo yes, this is a very old injustice. Don't remove the cap entirely, but make sure that Wizards are reasonably able to affect deep reds which fighters of same level are reasonably able to hit.<P>ITEM: Al'Kabor line of spells.<BR>Mmm... I didn't catch the pun, but never mind ! Beware that we already have an AE spell with lasting stun (Thunderbold, level 54). Besides, an all-or-nothing spell with split-second stun interrupting spellcasting has very little value if the stats are bad (the level 39 Al'Kabor spell already functions that way, and it isn't better than the others). Adding a few more targets may be an acceptable solution post-50, but not pre-50 because the spells are far too weak. An AE debuff would be great; see my page on Al'Kabor. <P>ITEM: Flaming Sword of Xuzl. <BR>Maybe I'm misreading, but I think that making Mordenkainen's Sword (oops, the Flaming Sword of Xuzl) "immune" isn't the point. The Sword must never generate any aggro toward itself, so it can't be killed by targeted damage, and it can't act as a defensive lure (so Wizards don't tread on the pet classes' grounds). Of course, it must generate a bit of aggro toward the Wizard. Now there's the case of non-targeted damage such as riposte and AE damage. It could be unfair to make the Sword "immune" to this, whereas regular pets are not. The solution lies in hit points. As long as the Sword can't act as a defensive lure, it doesn't matter if it has a lot of hit points or only a few; just decide how much riposte and AE damage the Sword should be able to withstand, and give it hit points and resistances accordingly. By the way, were the graphics corrected ? The Sword has to be flaming.<P>ITEM: Harvest. <BR>I CAN HELP YOU with the spell gem bug. This is not specific to Harvest, I had the problem in the past with Tishan's Clash. There is a vicious link between certain hotkeys (when the hotkey is used to activate an item such as Staff of Temperate Flux, Solist's Icy Wand or Journeyman's Boots) and certain spell gems, and the outcome is that the spell gem is untimely refreshed on the client side when the item's effect fires off. The spell gems and hotkeys can be switched and moved until there no problem remains (I did that); for instance, the deficient spell gems can be used for "instant" recast spells such as DD, so that the untimely refreshment is irrlevant; but it would be better if the bug was analyzed and fixed.<BR>As for Harvest not being effective post-50, all I can say is it's still somewhat good at level 48 (if only the full meditation time wasn't longer and longer...) If Harvest starts giving less than the standard three-quarters-of-a-bubble beyond a certain level, it's disappointing. I don't mind if you allow us to cast the spell more often, but NOT if the price to pay is a smaller mana gain: being able to summon that much mana in one shot is a precious asset, and I don't want to lose it.<P>ITEM: Rain Spells.<BR>YES ! take the pets out of the equation. YES ! Reduce the resist rates a bit. YES ! Add a wave (but it depends on what you call a "wave", I suspect you mean "hits": I usually say that Rains generate 4 "hits" in 3 "waves", because the concept of "wave" holds the idea of one or more things occurring at a given moment, with a repetitive pattern; two "waves" can't logically occur at the same time). The pre-50 Rains definitely need more hits (1 or 2 more), or larger hits. For the game's sake, I warn you: do not add hits for the post-50 Rains; they are already very good, and fixing the pet bug and the resist rates will be quite enough for them.<P>ITEM: Atol's Spectral Shackles.<BR>The fizzle obviously needs a fix, or I might continue to use Bonds of Force instead when I'm 51.<P>ITEM: Snare/Enstill.<BR>About Bonds of Force: sorry, you're 100% wrong, it ISN'T odd. You must remember that this is a late spell, added some months after the game was released. Most of the late additions to the Wizard repertoire (Bonds of Force, Harvest, Invisibility to Undead) have had a special twist in it, allowing Wizards to do something which they were totally unable to do before, and which looks like a specialty belonging to other classes; but with a special cost, limitation or drawback. Consider that the AE feature of Bonds of Force is primarily an INTENTIONAL DRAWBACK, because, in solo, it gives only one chance to stick (if failed, the Wizard will be in melee, and runs the risk of Snaring him/herself with the second attempt, and must switch to Root, Yonder or Tishan's Clash to regain distance), and IT SHOULD BE SO. The fact that Root and Snare can now stack has moderated the drawback already (we can Root, and then make additional Snare attempts). If you change Bonds of Force to single-target, you will be giving Wizards the message: "let your group down, and go out kiting mobs in solo like Druids do". The opportunity to Snare a few mobs at once sometimes compensates for the drawback and for the high mana cost. Changing the spell to single-target wouldn't "make more sense": Druids don't get AE Snare, and Wizards don't get single-target Snare, nothing wrong with that. If you want to reduce quad-kiting, the solution lies in nerfing the Column/Pillar spells with shorter range, as you once suggested, NOT in changing Bonds of Force, which is a honest and distinctive spell as it is.<BR>About Enstill (and Paralyzing Earth): yes, these spells have a problem, they never repay their double mana cost and longer cast time. Giving a fixed duration (45 seconds ?) would be fair - still, I would probably continue to use Immobilize even for parking mobs away from a fight, because Immobilize (or Root) is cheaper and more versatile, and I wouldn't want to memorize both. But I might use a fixed-duration Enstill as an opening spell to try and prevent double pull. Besides, these spells are not Wizard-only issues (I'm sure that Paladins, who can't even Gate, would travel much more safely across dangerous zones if they had an Enstill with fixed duration).<P>ITEM: Invisibility to Undead.<BR>Why not ? Are Wizards supposed to be POWERLESS against undead ? We can affect them with DD, like any other mob. Consider that undead have some sense for perceiving their environment (creatures and objects), and we know that this sense is different from normal vision; but, whatever this sense consists in (infravision, ultravision, radar, electro-magnetic scan, or mystical divination), some form of energy is needed to convey the perception. Wizards happen to be masters of energies (not "elements", that's for Magicians): heat, cold, electricity, "force" (which can be understood either as gravity and magnetism, or as "pure" magical energy), AND light (sight spells, invisibility). It is reasonable to assume that Wizards have identified the type of energy used by undead to "see", and have found a way to fiddle with it. The spell is fair because it comes late (level 39), is self-only, and has a high mana cost (100). Necromancers get a self-only invisibility versus living, and Wizards get a self-only invisibility versus undead; nothing wrong with that.<BR>By the way, Wizards being masters of energies including light, they could be given some more light-based spells such as Flash of light. Almost everybody can Fear or Intimidate in this game, why not us ? But I must admit that we're powerful enough without it.<P>ITEM: Teleport - West Karana.<BR>It's funny that such a super-old claim is coming up again; the first time I complained about this was summer 1999. If you don't want to rebuild the zone, I have an alternate solution: make sure that Abscond takes the party next to the Qeynos Hills zone, and make Abscond a level 39 spell (same as West Karana Portal). Reduce the cost of Abscond a bit too, so that a level 39 Wizard can afford it. I don't remember if Abscond is dropped, or on sale at vendors, but make sure that the intermediate-level Wizards can get it. Abscond isn't a powerful spell, you can do all this. I know that Abscond is primarily meant to be an escape spell and not a travelling help, but there can be exceptions; Siren's Grotto is already an exception.<P>ITEM: Teleport - Cazic Thule Gate.<BR>This is not a big deal, if only because there are ways to arrive invisible at destination (I made a page on Cazic Gate), and, when you're higher level, you don't fear the lizards. Some teleport locations ARE unsafe, it adds some spice. West Commons is marginally dangerous for Good Wizards, because of the occasional Kizdean Gix or Dragoon. North Karana is marginally dangerous for Evil Wizards, because of the occasional Qeynos guard. Cobalt Scar is substantially dangerous, but invisibility helps. The one and only dysfunctional portal is Wakening Lands, because of the "zone-in aggro bug" (when there's lag, your personal faction adjustments are taken into account some time later than when your character's body appears in the zone, so, Wuoshi freezes you even though you have worked your faction up, and he even sees invisible; I don't use this portal except intra-zone, or when I'm in a big hurry - I died unduly once and it's enough). The Wizard portals might be a bit more dangerous than the Druid counterparts overall, but this is probably because the Combine empire was over-confident and chose the locations less wisely than the Druids did. We are bright, and we can cope with the challenge.<P>ITEM: Fade, shadowstep and yonder.<BR>If I'm correct, these spells allowed to go uphill when the game was first released, but this caused a few Wizards to end up perched at great heights in some places, and they were whining and calling GMs, so the spells were MADE unable to go uphill. Once you know the limitation, it can be dealt with; it doesn't limit the spells' potential that much. But it can be changed back to allowing uphill travel, I don't mind.<P>ITEM: Evacs.<BR>Good idea. I also want to be able to make linkdead party members invisible, to help them survive if we're obliged to leave before they can log back on.<P>ITEM: Evacs and Abscond.<BR>I don't know Abscond, and I didn't know that intra-zone Evac was meant to clear aggro.<P>ITEM: Abscond. <BR>I don't know Abscond. It should be made lower-level (see "Teleport - West Karana" above).<P>ITEM: Concussion spell scroll.<BR>I can think of a very good reason why the spell is only level 39, and still impossible to obtain without the help of 50+ players. Unless used preventively (I do it a lot), Concussion serves to break free from melee, so, spell interruption is a critical factor. You know that, when using a spell 10 levels below ours, we get a big bonus for regaining concentration. So, I believe that the spell CAN be 39 and still BE MEANT FOR 49+ Wizards; the level difference is nothing more and nothing less than a boon for casting it more easily in melee. Besides, sub-50 Wizards can still count on Root or Immobilize to break free; it is beyond 50 that Summoning makes it much wiser to pass unnoticed instead of counting on Root. Now, if a Wizard is able to get the scroll early, good for him or her.<P>ITEM: Melee-proof NPCs.<BR>Looks like a false good idea to me. The poor fighters are down-trodden enough already.<P>ITEM: Diamond Rod.<BR>I agree (although the Rod still saves a spell slot and some mana). If you remove the component cost, give me one of these and you can keep the Epic Quest weapon ! I think that the component was introduced because of the Manastone abuse. I believe that the Manastone was nerfed (doesn't drop anymore, and is shut off on the Planes and in the extensions) because there existed loopholes (the most simple abuse being Clerics eating up all their hit points to gain mana, and rinsing and repeating with Complete Heal, gaining hefty mana in the process). Well, a Diamond rod with no component would allow the same abuse, because the Manastone eats up the shield before it begins to eat up hit points. The Staff of the Four will allow the abuse too (besides allowing this abuse, it is one of the lousiest Epic Quest weapons of all, I mean, the effect is good and comfortable, but not Epic at all, we deserved something offensive). The point is that the Diamondskin spell itself munches a peridot. Only post-50 buffs should munch peridots; level 44 spells should use less expensive stones, 3 or 4 pp each, grand maximum.<P>ITEM: Imbue Fire Opal Scroll.<BR>As far as I know, this spell serves for trade skills, and I have no opinion.<P>ITEM: Eye of Zomm.<BR>I agree: Eyes are wonderful especially to explore pits, because they don't take falling damage, but as soon as they fall in water the fun is over. For the game's sake, you should make the Eye immune to player attacks, just as regular pets are (I won't tell you why, my Necro friend will be upset). <P>ITEM: Damage spell variety.<BR>This is exxagerated. We never have to fall back more than one spell rank, and some ranks have two DD spells of different energy types (one heat or cold, and one "magic"). The only period in a Wizard's career when there's some serious trouble is levels 20-23, because the new DD (Force Shock) is all-or-nothing and unreliable, while the previous spell (Flame Shock) is much smaller, and at the same time the melee capabilities of Wizards, which used to be an appreciated complementary source of damage, become ridiculous versus mob toughness. But this is not really a matter of choice between different energy types, and is probably an intentional trial.<P>ITEM: Critical Hits with Spells.<BR>More damage, I would say. From former discussions, the main point which I remember is that the extra damage mustn't generate extra aggro (a fully resisted spell does the same aggro as a spell doing full damage, so the amount of damage should be left out of the equation altogether). <P>ITEM: Target too low level bug.<BR>Seems annoying. <P>ITEM: Quad Kiting.<BR>Yes, it is hard and time-consuming. At least with the level 34 Circle of Force; I tried a few times and gave up. The most annoying thing with quad-kiting is that it makes other classes bitter and jealous, and with good reason; it's not that way I hope to shine in this game. You have suggested somewhere that the range (not radius) of Columns/Pillars could be reduced so that the spells can be profitably used only in regular group play; that's an excellent idea.<P>ITEM: Suppression spells.<BR>Why not a Silence spell like in AD&D, preventing all spellcasting ? (Ha ha, joke). At any rate, I wouldn't want a mob to cast an anti-Gate spell on me.<BR>I've got a related question: on giants/dragons/gods, stun spells and Mesmerize have a duration of zero. BUT... do they still interrupt spellcasting ? Giant spellcasters are rare, and there are usually a dozen players hitting them at the same time, so, it seems that no one was ever able to tell for sure if the zero-duration stun/mezz interrupted spells or not. Now that many Velious Giants are able to gate, I'd like to know if we're all wasting our time trying to stun them to prevent gating when they're low on life.<P>ITEM: Blink Spell.<BR>I would never use such a spell, it would be much more disruptive than useful (it will make our group lose fights, and make us lose our body when travelling). But you may make the cast time of Shadowstep/Yonder even shorter if you want, almost instantaneous; this wouldn't hurt. Besides, two successive casts are often needed to gain enough distance to be safe, so, the recast time is an issue too.<P>ITEM WHICH IS NOT MENTIONED IN THE LIST:<BR>A reasonable upgrade to the Solist's Icy Wand. I know that you don't want to do the same mistake than with Jaundiced Bone Bracers and Elder Spiritist Vambraces (although you SHOULD nerf them, or at least end the drop, if you regret having put them in the game). But there's room between a weak item and an overpowered item. For instance, the Solist's Icy Wand is overpowered in the hands of a level 13-19 Wizard (you should be more careful with the minimum level required to activate such items), but it's a fair item from level 20 to 38, getting quickly obsolete afterwards. Moderately high level Wizards need an item with a "damage/cast time" ratio about 4-6 times lower than the "damage / (cast + recast) time" ratio of their current DD. This is not good enough to replace our spells when quick damage is needed, but allows us to inflict a better base load of damage (better than casting and medding) when there's no hurry... If the item's ratio is 10+ times lower than our DD's ratio, the item is plain useless, because it's better, on the long term, to just cast real spells and sit inbetween.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wow...I'm am really amazed that someone would post wizards shouldn't get invis to undead while necros deserve regular invis since "gather shadows" is a totally different sort of spell.  I'd love to know what in the world they mean by that.  The wizard spell is self only...just like gather shadows.  Only difference is we have to wait 30 levels or so to get it.  Neither makes a lot of sense in terms of roleplaying.  Regular invis was put in for necros and sks in order to let them travel around without getting killed in the cities.  A big deal when the game started and we were all newbies.  Invis to undead lets wizards get to groups without fighting a million low level greens on us (usually forcing an evac before you get to your group).  If wizards don't need invis to undead then I think gather shadows needs to be removed from SK's and necros.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>First off well done on the list. It addresses most of the concerns of the class well.<P>I see the problem your faced with for wizards is how to balance them for the ubermobs in velious yet not make them grossly overpowered for the day to day adventures players will encounter. <P>I think the suggestion of Fixing the mana efficiency of the spells is perfect. Its long overdue, there is not a large enough diffrence between the manacost of our spells to warrant what you sacrafice as a wizard compared to other casters nukes.<P>Secondly on the ubermob problem. I love the idea of percentage based nukes but I also feel that there would be other options to implement. I have been pondering the idea of some wizard /disciplines for awhile and I think they may be the answer to the dillema your faced with. Some disciplines I have thought of would work as follows. These are just ideas BTW so obviously if you like the ideas you could modify them.<P>First idea for discipline would be "evoker frenzy"<BR>When this is activated the wizards manacost on spells would be cut by 50% for duration of discipline. I was thinking 1-2 mins would be appropriate amount of time for this discipline to last. This would essentially allow the wizard to double his manapool temporarily and would allow for a complete manadump into ubermob_01.  due to the power of this discipline it would be necessary to have it require a LARGE reuse time such as 2 hours. <P>Second discipline was "resistless"  As the name states for X amount of time (my thought was 5 mins) all spells cast will hit for full damage. This would allow wizard to maximize their mana usage. It would better bring them up to the level of the other INT casters who have pets to do damage while they medding. Also due to the power of this discipline it would be necessary to make a LARGE reuse time on the discipline.<P>Third idea for discipline was "Bursting thoughts" This would allow the wizard to go into a meditative frenzy where they would be stunned for about 1 min straight. this would completely refill the wizards manapool but at great risk to the wizard. For 1 minute they would be unable to move cause they would be stunned. This is basically a version of harvest but with much greater reward and risk.<P>Anyhow, these are just some suggestions you may want to consider.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 13 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-11.html">11</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-12.html">12</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-13.html">13</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000784&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000784&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
