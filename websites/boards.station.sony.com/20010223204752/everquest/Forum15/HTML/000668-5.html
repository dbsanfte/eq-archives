</FONT><HR>OK, another new idea and not a major one but if rangers are so great at archery and have some great class specific weapons with procs (Icy Blade, Dragon Horn Ykesha, Epics, etc.) is it possible that we would be able to cast a dexterity spell on ourselves (and others).  We do share some spells with the Shamans such as Feet Like Cat, Root, Levitate, SoW and to an extent the str spells, why not have a spell or two for Dexterity.  Maybe a small one at lvl 22 similar to Dextrous Aura and another one (hopefully near a Kitty Feet upgrade!!) at lvl 39 or 49 similar to the spell Spirit of Monkey or Rising Dexterity.  We also have a few spells that are outside the Druid parent class line like Kitty Feet, Jolt, and Eyes of the Cat, so this isn't necessarily a huge leap for Dex spells as well.<P>There are a LOT of things being done to change and balance the classes, and I think that Rangers should be good at what they do, most of which they are.  Dexterity is a vital part of our class and I would love to see us get even better at it!<P>Thanks for your time and thought into a GREAT class (no matter what ANYONE says!)<P>Ryallen Taur'Kalmindon</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Paladin has Armor of Faith, Shield of Words - but so does EVERY melee, all they have to do is get in a group with a cleric.  Oh yea, every group has a cleric.  <P>Also, how about the fact that Tolans (and Velious) class armors for rangers are only a TOTAL of 17-19 raw AC less than Knights equivalent armors?<P>These things plus lowered level for Jolt and new Fire Jolt do MUCH to mitigate the supposed defensive disadvantage of Rangers.<P>I'm still finding it humourous Rangers are now better buffers (call of earth, strength of nature, call of predator, even skin like nature) than Paladins after Velious and month of changes.<P>Facts here people, deal with it.  Paladins sure are forced to.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Archery<P>Ranger, of general Archery damadge. A cursory study of medieval arms and armory will demonstrate the value of long range, accurate missile fire. Quite arguably it is more effective than direct assault weapons. The crossbow, because of its high velocity penetrating ability, rendered heavy armor in many cases obsolete. The EQ game masters are of course free to do anything they want in  there fantasy game world. But, if it is an approximation of medieval technology, i would argue that arrows should do as much damadge as melee. The solution it to make arrows do the same amount of damadge, relative to level and archery skills, as their melee counterparts. For example, my Sap of Piety does 13 damdge. Routinely it hits for 35 damage, at my level and strength. My Trueshot longbow, which does 20 damage, does on average ...20 damage. Axe, 16 dam, does 52 at the present time, and has increased as I have gained in level. This bow, would do 60 or better, based on weapon damage of bow, analogously. One well placed arrow will accomplish what 2 minutes of parrying/slashing will not. Neck or eye shot... crippling blow! So add that in too. It makes Rangers important, and useful. Makes fletching useful; and many complain about the useless cost of obtaining this skill. Who wants to buy a bow? Not many,i'll wager, when their melee counterparts are so incredible. Keep the Rangers offensive melee skills below the warrior.. they should be.. His/her major area of endeavor should be Archery and Magic use(isnt that the significance of the Ranger symbol?) not hacking and slashing. EQ Rangers are weak Fighter/magic users,... not Rangers,  with out this skill. I remember reading Lord of the Rings, long ago, and Legolas would down most beasts with a single arrow. Now that would make this a worthy class. Forget everything else.. its small potatoes compared to this single issue.. arrow/bow damadge. (Targeting with z axis is 3 dimensional game problem, and should clearly be improved. However, agree that obstructions from group members, should make a Ranger less efficient.. slow shot rate(by choice, more selective, is more realistic). Example, aiming high to avoid hitting friend  double delay.. 'aimed shot'.) <P>These are my thought, Thanks for reading<BR>Pliskin, Ranger, Seventh Hammer server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Abashail, if that is the case (and I haven't convinced myself it is) then Knights need MORE AC, not Rangers needing less.<P>But to be honest, with a modest Defense bump, I think Rangers need more HP more desparately than AC.  I was talking to a Shadow Knight last night (he was 50 and I'm a 56 Ranger).  He was amazed at how low our HP are.<P>I don't want as much HP as a Knight, I'm not trying to infringe on their tanking, but we should be closer to a Knight than to a Druid.  Currently we have almost the same self-buffed HP as a self-buffed caster class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>one other item about rangers i just remember<BR> 1) tolans boots and gaunts dont seem to be dropping as much as the normal flow of loot would in this world,can get a lamentation blade which is  in a harder dungeon moreo ften from a player by buying it that you coul tolans boots from looting it,i know weapons and armor two differnt items,but  i have never seen since kunark came out someone selling tolans boots.please look into this.<P>2) make effect on the boots self only,so that the ranger in middle of fight can hit them for invigor,you say it is a group spell? well change it to something that would not be a group spell,i.e. rename it.why would we want to use boots on group,when stamina only matters during a fight,would we stop fighting just to use this spell? heck no,but making it self only gives us stamina during battle without having to take off target,worry about getting hit while targeting somone else to use this spell,and admit it,i bet not one ranger with these boots uses the effect,all they wanted is the ac,in my opinion,this making of the effect self only and targeted to self automatically like self buff spells,would add to value of boots and make them more usefull.<BR> thanks,i hope your still reading these,please do.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Faust,<P>Rangers are warriors to a degree, but they are also druid to a degree. If you read any fantasy book, play any fantasy RPG, check into anything concerning fantasy rangers, they have always been trackers, archers, and animal handlers. It's their thing. Unfortuneatly, It seems their thing is now becoming everyone's thing in Norrath. <P>Give Rogue's tracking, <BR>Give Necros backstab,<BR>Give Warriors Complete Heal<BR>Give Bards EXP rez's<BR>Give Clerics Ice Comet<BR>Give Shaman's ports<BR>Give Rangers Illusions<BR>Give Mages plate armor<BR>Give Wizards pets<BR>Give Pally's Duel Wield<BR>Give Knights mage spells<BR>Give Monks Hide/Sneak<P>Verant's idea's on balancing classes are unbalancing Game Play. What will we have in 6 months? 13 classes who all wear plate, duelweild, port, complete heal, backstab, track, deliver crippling blow, summon, rez, hide/sneak, feigndeath, DD, DoT, self buff, sing, have pets, and can illusion themselves to look like anything.<P>I, for one, don't want that. I like individuality. If we all have the same skills, weapons, stats, spells, armors, etc. Then why bother having classes at all? We can get rid of 12 of the classes and all play Super_Character_ 01. So what if you have blue armor and the other supercharacter has red armor, this game isn't quake. It use to be a FRPG, or a similarity to a FRPG. Now, it's barely RPG at all, it's more of a FFPS. Lets just make a fantasy skin MOD for quake and all go play it?<P>Verant. Stop balancing by giving all classes each other's abilities. That's not balancing the classes. What it is doing, is actually making it to where there is no individuality. Nothing making a class that class. Hell, why not just drop all the classes down to Warrior, Rogue, Cleric, Mage. At least that way, you can see the definition that needs to be inplace. (that was sarcasm btw).  You had/have a great idea for a game, too bad the more you try to improve it, the more you are actually screwing it up.<P>Jarethe Ki<BR>44th Ranger (or what ever)<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I just made 45 and I enjoy playing my ranger immensly,,,  When I first started I was told by some rl friends that I should pick something else that rangers dont get groups and cant solo and a bunch of other nonsense.. I have found that the ranger is good in both respects.  I have also read most of the postings here.  I primarily get inot group and become puller if we have a warrior I pull and let the warrior engage b4 I start meleeing. I use a carved darkwood bow and routinely get 13 to 30 dmg hits, and occasionally up to a 57 critical.  I have and probalby will in the future play the part of a warrior if none available,, only if the healing power is behind me .. so I dont manage the damage i take I trust that my healer will tell me when not to pull or engage because low on mana.  The other nice thing is that if i happen to pull I can very easily kite with littler or no mana and use the bow as my weapon of damage..  I have recently dispatched a sand giant when he hit 1/4 life with my bow and about 70 arrows..  I know a druid or other pure caster could have dispatched same giant much faster and a whole lot less expensive but the fact remains if you play your ranger with a little skill and forthought there is no reason that you should die in most situations.  talking levels that have sow available or in a group where sow is available,, because you have casting ability and also the bow which i say get your skill up on..  thank you for listening to my long winded speech,  Good luck all and enjoy the game dont analyze it to death<P>Wargold<BR>45th ranger</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Please give us more defense, give us more HP's, Please stop us dying.  So what do they DO?  Up our offence.  This is about the best way to make our situation worse than ever. Why did we post on this boards, why did we waste our time even expressing an opinion when the final outcome is the exact OPPOSITE of what is required.<P>Absor, is this some kind of sick joke, you will never raise our defense after giving us an offensive bonus as you will see us as too powerful.  You have just destroyed a whole class in EQ.  All the other classes have got something related to their requests, check out Druids already arguably the most overpowered class in EQ, you just made them healers as well.

</FONT><HR>   To whom it may concern,<BR>   I'm a fledgling @ this RNGR bit, let alone the grandness of EQ, so please excuse my ignorance.  I've a played time of about 2 days & am only lvl 12.  My 1st time reading these postings I appreciate such a device indeed, sum I agree sum not.  During part of Absor's postings was mentioned how RNGRs should be equivalant to KNGTs in a deffensive measure, this I disagree.  I'm finding it very challenging the balance between armour, labouring items, & such yet nonetheless;  historically KNGTs have better armour.  Upon the issues of foraging food/drink, it doesn't make sense if a RNGR foraged such that he/she couldn't use, that makes no logical sense, also I'm unsure of the duration one could go w/out nourishment.  Lastly,  the bow/arrow situation, which I was booned such yet haven't used.  Again, RNGRs should be more capable than WARs.  Accuracy though of course I believe should be better :-)  But I have not experienced the hit/miss of such.  I appreciate the time & effort of all N EQ!  Attempting survival ACLORA(trial mem. Order of Virtue) upon the RATHE :-)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hmmm.  Well I played a ranger before I left it to be a cleric so when I went /ooc LFG....I'd get some  responses.  Flat out overall all hybrids get the shaft on finding a group. Most of it is just the viewpoints of other players that does this but it is attributed to the skills/abilities of the other classes.  And really VI is in a bind here cause if they make the hybrids as good at tanking as the warrior why be the warrior blah blah?  Well there is no fix.  Face it (and believe me I hate it, cause damn being a cleric is about as fun as watching paint dry on the wall...which I really do as I play as a cleric cause god knows we are sitting on our butts most of the time) but starting around level 40 most people view you as a ranger as useless (I don't but yes most do) and at level 50 and beyond it just seems that unless yer one of the "pure" classes: Cleric, Warrior, Monk, Wizard, Rogue, Enchanter, and maybe Mage (maybe) well guess what go play that twink cause yer not gonna have any easy time moving forward, and god knows the game is hard enough as it is.  <P>A group needs a tank... Rangers are the LAST option if an option at all.  Group needs a puller? Last option hell no monk...we can't pull without a monk.  Group needs a damage output?  well rogue and monk...what? a ranger bah they suck.  Flat out that is what pops to ANY non ranger mind it seems when you first utter that word.  Ranger? Bah they suck.  <P>I dunno I still think hands down they are the funnest class to play in the game, but it's too bad no one thinks they are even worth the trouble.  Of course now that i'm approaching that Level 50 mark with my cleric I'm really starting to wonder if Post 50 EQ is even worth my time since really it's a matter of not even your choice as a player but factors way out of your control (class abilities, player conception of the class).   I dunno I know there are plenty of rangers out there that are above fifty but god...hats off to em cause A: that exp penalty was lifted not too long ago and B: unless they made some close friends early on that were willing to stick with em no matter how much they "sucked", that road had to be damn near impossible.<P>Ok now what I think they need to do is make a ranger equivalant to a rogue as far as defense SKILLS  are involved (buffs make up AC).  Instead of Backstab they have spells.  So overall damage wise they rank just under the rogues.  Ok rogues sit down quit screaming.  There is still reason to play rogues...if you don't want to worry about mana, boom be a rogue, if you like the fun of being able to cast spells play a ranger.  Rogues also get Duel wield earlier.  It's just if that is done when people go to look for that damage output guy (cause that is what rangers should be looked at as) and can't find a rogue they won't overlook a ranger cause: Bah They suck.  To me I can understand why people want archery looked at, but...it's so pointless.  Just the way the game is set up.  I got a trueshot bow with my ranger early on and I barely have used it...yeeha...unless the thing is far far away heck you can't even shoot the darned thing. <P>Binding.  Jeeze people we are tanks/melee.  Give up the "Role Playing" to try to get a cheezey way to get a GREAT benefit to a melee class no other would have.  If that is the case then you really should be wearing leather (metal is man made and produced in cities.)  and only be equiping weapons made of wood so no swords, maces or anything for that matter. Nuff said that is silly sorry.<P>TPing yes this is something I've been saying since I found out palys get rez.  Paly's get 39 rez in the end I only think it's fair that rangers get all port spells that a Level 39 druid has, maybe minus a few but at least the major places being BB, WC, NK, DL, Sro or Feerott, and Iceclad or Great Devide, (not all at once mind you but by level 60 all these options are available with at least one major port available for group in a continent by level 51 or so).<P>One last thing (sorry this is so long but I love rangers..and by god I want to see them prosper) Hps.  Ok this is a joke.  Minimum the same as a rogue..but I think they should at least be the same as the other hybrids.  That has nothing to do with AC or anything.  Hell other classes should really want that too.  Clerics won't be burning so much mana keeping a melee class that doesn't have much more hps than a caster alive.  BUT I'm just saying this assuming that they have less HPS than a rogue or a monk.  Not wanting to trod on their toes at all.  I also think taunt should go out the window, or at least a low cap since I'm seeing a ranger as mostly a magic based rogue.  See to me it's a differant style of rogue, and that is how they should be regarded and they should have the skills to match it.  Cause seriously I think a person should pick a class that they want to play based on their style, not oh god will I be able to do any fun raids post fifty with this class? Nope, better pick a Cleric, Monk, Rogue, Warrior, or Wizard.  Why even have the other classes?  Now I'm sure there are things to improve paladins but I have no where near the experiance playing them as I do with playing rangers so I couldn't help at all there (heck I've never played an SK).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>rangers problems = low hp,low ac,low defence,uber mobs role(major).<BR>these problems are in a nutshell what i see as MAJOR to the ranger, fixing almost any one of them would be a great benefit, but saying we do more damage so have less defence benefits is not right. we are none plate class accepted, HP should be based on race/warrior , defence should be race/class.<BR>Uber mob encounters, rangers for a short while had a role in some of these, till trueshot disc got 'fixed'=neutered either a true fix on this or maybe another ability would be good. An idea i had on this was comparable to the paly loh or sk harm touch, and before people start the flames please read and think about it:<BR>Rangers are a damage dealer endeavoring to kill the opponent before it harms their friends, to throw him/herself into the fray wholeheartedly, why not give an ability to reflect this ie; ONCE per day the ranger can'frenzy' :mad :mad :mad on a single opponent and return all damage done to him/her back at the opponent as well as the damage normally done, i would include magical damage in this equation. this would reflect the 'gods' smiling on the fight and allow the ranger to 'sacrifice' for the group. This would not in any way replace any of the other classes abilities, nor would it usurp the prerogatives of the other hybrids loh etc. In effect the ranger would be sacrificing self for the group, since the mob will almost certainly agro and remain so till the ranger dies. Death for one or the other will be certain and the ranger is the one most likely to die, but UNLIKE most uber mob situations at least will have been able to deal significant damage before doing so.<BR>this ability could be given to rangers from lvl one up, since the limiting factor is the hp's of the ranger, ac would have no effect because it is only damage TAKEN that is mirrored back at the attacker, it would also not be unbalancing since heal casting times on rangers are mostly too little and too late. But i say again this would in my honest opinion a least give the ranger a feeling of acheiving something on major encounters and other people involved the idea of the true worth of a ranger!!!!!!!!!<BR>Moderate problems as i see are bows,hate levels, defining skill/abilities.<BR>please give bows procs and replace the line of sight limitation with the same limits as spells.<BR>the changes to track look good, grats let us see how they work out.<BR>defining skills/abilities if the suggestion on bows,or similar is taken i could happily accept track and bow as that ability.<BR>On ranger binding, as outdoor class rangers have been calling for self bind outside cities, why not make is bound by others outside cities ?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Only been playing a month or so and max ranger is lvl 16, so limited experience but i have played a lot and read a lot of these discussions too and i think there are three strands of opinion.<P>1. People who want to be tanks but think dual wield looks cool - GO AND BE A TANK, I don't want you to be a ranger. Verant please make changes to keep these people away.<P>2. People who have an idea about how a fantasy ranger should be: wilderness, archery etc and want stuff that makes it easier to play a ranger the way they visualise a ranger. Similarly ppl who play paladins, rogues and SK's seem to have a strong 'role' element in their discussions. I think this is VERY GOOD.<P>3. People who want rangers to be more group-desirable especially at higher-levels. This seems to me to be over-shadowing the 2nd concern because EQ is group-centric. I can't comment on ranger desirability from personal experience but i've heard it said a lot.<P>I personally think rangers SHOULD be 2nd rate tanks with good utility spells. I think we should be relatively CRAP in a dungeon. BUT what i think we should have to make up for it is a DISTINCT and MAJOR advantage over all other classes in wilderness zones.<P>I think this might be one way to balance the grouping problem people with the fantasy ranger people. Instead of changing the class tanking abilities for dungeon-crawling, change the class wilderness abilities and create more wilderness zones where those abilities can be used to good effect - both solo AND with a group.<BR> <BR>From my experience so far:<P>Tracking is obviously number one, it was good at low levels before and is now better - thanks. <P>Archery should be MUCH more useful - i don't even use archery for pulling anymore, i use flame lick and you can only kite stuff that is really slow anyway and it takes weeks to kill anything. I still shoot at gnoll pups just cos they are the only thing i can kill in less than an hour. It's a defining skill for us fantasy ranger ppl and it is mostly useless.<P>Fletching: related to archery. At moment the cost of fletching trade skill is outwieghed by everything except people's desire to do trueshot quest. You can't make money at it as no-one wants bows - because they are so useless. Yet it costs an absolute fortune to increase skill. If archery was more effective then the cost of fletching would be less of a problem because the demand would go up. Otherwise the cost should come down.<P>That would be my view, don't make rangers better tanks, make them better rangers and create areas where ranger abilities are valuable to a group. This seems to me to be something u can do at any level without unbalancing the classes at all.<P>What else: I think classes should have a distinct flavour. I think zone and quest design should be used to bring out the flavour. If u keep tweaking classes to get rid of class weaknesses then ends up every class is the same. However this requires work by Verant at char creation time - making sure classes are described well enough that ppl pick a class that suits them.<P>Ranger quests:<BR>AAARGH - do you know how painful the qeynos ranger quests are. Gnoll poachers - rare spawn - long wait. Gnoll hunters rare drops off rare spawns - looong wait. Skulking gnoll - seen once in all time i've been in surefall - rare drop i assume - infinite wait. CLOAK OF JAGGEDPINE - the most painful experience of my life (exagerate a little there). Same cask as wanted by higher level rogues - means price offered for one by rogue is 3 or 4 times what u would pay for cloak. You do it anyway cos u want guild/ranger specific stuff. You maybe new to game - rogues aren't cos higher level - you get rogues KSing u on brewers before you know what KSing is. You sell casks for next to nothing because you don't know how rare they are. Rogues need one for something cool, rangers need 3 for something they want but wouldn't pay 30pp for if it wasn't ranger-specific. I did it - i don't want other ppl to suffer - don't make cloak better - split quests so rogue and ranger are after different item. Make casks common drop off brewers. An AC6 cloak with dex + 3 is cool for fighting 3 brewers and all the guards in between - a qeynos ranger's rite of passage at lvl 9 or so rather than nightmare it is at moment.<P>Again thanks for tracking<P>Wolfrunner<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Some intersting ideas on this thread, I'd like to add my views ont he subject. I have a Ranger of the 51st season on MM server. IN my opinion Until about level 45 or so rangers are very well balanced. Aside from a very few dificult camps groups do not NEED specific classes other then healer, melee ,caster types.  Above level 45 is where the problem comes in mobs start to become very difficult, specific classes in groups and being part of a group is essential to gaining exp and enjoyable gameplay. The game is supposed to be played in groups, rangers are often overlooked for groups in faor of other classes, because we dont offer anything unique to contribute, especially indoors, where a lot of the 45+ game is played. <P>Consider a group or multiple groups going on a dragon raid, Vox, wuoshi, Naggy. You know where they are(static spawn). You need warrioirs to take damage,and defeclt damage from casters. You need casters to DD the mob, you need clerics to buff and heal, you need an enchanter to buff and debuff. When these spots are filled a group has 2 to 3 spots left. The question becomes what would you prefer the last class to be? invariably in thsese situations its better to take a warrior with a higher mr and HP.<P>Rangers are let in groups not NEEDED in groups, we do not do one thing better than any other class that is useful to a group at higher levels, smae goes for SK and PAl classes. What evrant needs to do is make a skill for each class that is useful in any group, a skill unique to the class, that a group needs. That is really the only way  classes will be balanced.<P>This is not to arbitrarily dismiss the issues pre level 45, but honestly most problems hybrids have before this level is a perception problem, and has little to do with playabiltiy.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>72 MINUTE SKILL FOR RANGERS:<P>I've always thought that rangers should have a class specific skill like paladins (Lay on Hands) and ShadowKnights (HarmTouch) have. Here's my idea:<BR>CALL OF THE WILD<P>This skill could be used once per game day like the paldin and SK skills. It would call to the rangers side a animal of COMPARABLE LEVEL to the ranger. I say this because a level 50 ranger using this skill isn't going to get much help from a Black Wolf. The animal summoned to the rangers side would fight for the ranger until one of the following occurs:<P>A: The CURRENT monster the ranger is fighting when the skill is used is dead (CURRENT meaning once THAT monster is dead, the animal departs).<P>B: The summoned animal dies.<P>C: The ranger dies or zones out.<P>In the cases of "A" and "C" the animal would simply disappear, its service to the ranger completed.<P>The summoned animal should not argo on party members or other PCs (unless the ranger is fighting one, ie: Duel).<P>I know this skill may seem to some as giving rangers 'pets', but since the animal only stays around for ONE FIGHT then is gone and the skill can only be used once per game day, I don't think it's too unbalancing.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've read so many posts on this, and other related threads, I think my brain may fry and I just can't read anymore.<P>The 'list' looks like a good start, but how much of it will get implemented, and to what extent? /cringes at the likely outcome<P>I play a ranger for one reason; their depiction in all fantasy settings that I am familiar with is what I like to see myself as, or that I would strive to be, in a RPG setting.<P>What is this picture fantasy paints rangers as?<BR>1)They almost unequaled at being 'at home' outdoors.<BR>2)Because they spend so much time outdoors, the must wear lighter, more flexible armor.<BR>3)Not having the protection, weight and constriction of plate armors, they not only HAVE TO BE more 'agile' on their feet, they are ABLE to be more 'agile'!<P>The only other melee class I can see being 'more' defensive is monks, and MAYBE rogues. Defensively, no one in plate should ever equal a ranger with the exception of the above 2 classes. And by 'defensive' here I do NOT mean AC, it is a skill based on agility and the 'lightness' to use that agility. I.E. Dodge, parry and reposte, AND the char's AGI actually affecting those 3.<P>Scenario:<BR> mortal enemies meet for single combat. ranger in chain, leather, or yes, even less and a knight in full plate.<P>Conclusion:<BR> indeterminate: I do not propose the ranger or the knight would win, but you can be sure of a couple of things. It would be fight that would last much longer than either of them would care to fight. Knight pulls his hefty blade all the way to the 'Back 40', then starts to swing. Once that blade it moving, it's NOT changing course! But if it lands a blow, it's going to hurt, and hurt bad! Meanwhile, the ranger has taken a number of swings at the knight's undefended mid section, unfortunately, he couldn't get any to penetrate that massive armor. It truly would be a long painful fight to watch!<P>Rangers are NOT weapons masters! That's for warriors, if they desire to pursue that! Take my 1h & 2h blunt skills and quit creating weapons 'out of character' simply in an attempt to get players to spend more time learning new skills in order to slow their level progression (don't even want to go there).<P>As other 'rangers' have proposed, I do NOT want more hp's! If that's the solution, just let Neanderthal barbarians be rangers too. I don't want to be Conan the Barbarian, I want to be able to evade his big 2h blade.<P>Take my DoT's, DD's, damage shields, self buffs, the added offensive skills we just got, yes, and even take my SoW... just give me the defensive ability which I should logically have due to lighter, more flexible armor and the added advantage a higher agility would give me in those types of armors (read 'make agility actually count for something'). Of course if you take away the spells that I mention away (which you won't?), rangers become even more unviable as 'soloists', which also happens to be one of their 'defining hallmarks' in most fantasy settings.<BR>Holy crap!!! did I just maybe hit on why rangers are so hard for Verant to deal with? The 'classic' ranger doesn't 'fit' their foundational philosophy that 'group work' is the only real way to advance (this also just happens to rub against the basic human nature of a good many of your customers who are ‘soloists’ at their core, who, like the leopard, are being asked, nay forced, to change their spots). I can't believe writing this post took me here, even though that is another issue I have with EQ. No, I’m not proposing that a ranger should be able to solo a dragon. Interestingly, fantasy often DOES portray rangers having difficulty integrating into groups, even when after the same goals. I am only mentioning this in regards to Verant’s stated logic that at higher levels, a player wishing to group ‘should’ already have ‘group skills’ and integrate without a hitch. This does not necessarily fit the role-playing model laid out for ranger in most fantasy settings. Is this a RPG? or a game system which continues down the path of ‘synthetic equality’ of the classes?<P>It is obvious from the 'facts' that rangers can NEVER replace a warrior even with equal or better defensive skills, even taking into consideration our offensive spells (which take valuable time away from melee), self buffs and utility spells (which are almost always meaningless in groups).<P>God, oh please dear God let someone with common sense, an understanding of human nature and who has even a little say in these matters read this post.<P>Kynoss<P>Over 385 combined level with approx. 7.8 months ONLINE time on 3 servers.<P>45th Wood Elf Druid<BR>39th Human Ranger<BR>27th DE Warrior<BR>25th Wood Elf Druid (deleted)<BR>23rd Erudite SK<BR>22nd Wood Elf Ranger<BR>20th Human Monk<BR>19th Barbarian Shaman<BR>16th Barbarian Shaman<BR>16th Barbarian Rogue<BR>15th Wood Elf Druid<BR>15th Half Elf Ranger<BR>15th Wood Elf Rogue (deleted)<BR>13th Erudite Chanter<BR>12th DE Necro<BR>11th Half Elf Bard<BR>10th Troll Warrior<BR>10th Half Elf Paladin<BR>9th Wood Elf Ranger<BR>8th Barbarian Warrior<BR>7th Erudite Mage<BR>… plus  numerous other more minor and deleted chars<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>How about sneak archery?<BR>See if this scene sounds cool: a solitary ranger, sneaking from tree to tree, striking fear into a dozen orcs as his arrows kill one after another. <P>Now look at a similar scene with the EQ ranger: the ranger's first shot does NOTHING. Second shot does 4 damage. Third shot does 23 with a critical. Fourth shot does 4 damage. Melee. Ranger is overwhelmed and dies.<P>It would be nice if you could stay sneaked and still fire arrows, and if you could actually kill stuff with more than 10 arrows. It would not unbalance the game, because 80 arrows would only kill maybe 10 creatures, and would cost more than the loot from the 10 creatures.  Sneak archery would also give the Ranger that mysterious, scary feeling that he SHOULD have- invisible killer, like a sniper. With the z-axis fix, this would make the ranger a valuable scout and a long-range bodyguard- imaging shooting that minotaur just before it disrupted your wizard's spell!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>More on archery.<P>Apart from the axis & missing problems the main issue with archery is utterly crap damage. Verant are reluctant to increase damage on archery for 2 main reasons.<P>a) it would create an unlimited source of damage (ie no mana)<BR>b) creates a kiting problem<P>To limit the situations above and enable archery to be what it should i propose the following.<P>a) if more then 50% damage done to a mob is archery/thrown the corpse poofs (no exp). We can kite a mob for 3-4 shots then close in and melee. Perfect!<BR>b) make sure archery has a good chance to break root. Same as any other nuke...for obvious reasons.<BR>c) make damage a multiple of bow damage & arrow damage. To do the best damage we would have to use the best arrows which cost money, have to be made, take up a lot of room, require a highly trained fletching skill and run out fast.<P><BR>Arrolas Lendel<BR>57 Outrider<BR>Torv</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Unfortunately for some this game is not set up to be a roleplaying game in the sense of playing out your part.  I'm not saying it's a good thing but it's the way the thing is set up.  And let me tell ya after 45 mostly all zones that give exp are indoors, with really tough mobs tha pack a wallop.  I totally understand what yer saying about a ranger's role in "fantasy" worlds.  But this is EQ.  It has it's own rules and styles.  EQ is a group game will always be a group game infact post fifty most of the major things take multiple groups.  I guess I must be a munchkin and a power monger, but really If I choose to play a ranger I want to be able to do those major things.  Meaning I want to have the same CHANCE at doing em, not the same ability.  To me a warrior is a great class tons of AC, Defense, and HPs and no a ranger shouldn't have ALL of those AND spells no.  All I'm saying is just get them to the point that when a said group sees a ranger ooc for a group...the group looking doesn't automatically say "next".  Or when it's time to do those people don't look at a ranger and say nah rangers are useless.  I play a ranger cause they have melee damage abilities with nukes and stuff for their "crit hits"...a little of magic and melee for damage.  To me that's a perfect mix.  Does that mean we should have Plate? Heck no.  Now i'm not going to go on about not wanting to be a barbaric warrior blah blah (rolls eyes sorry) but that would be horridly unbalanced...I do like the agi thing mebbe like a  monk somewhat? but not as good...maybe a lower agi bonus to AC like half that of a monks.<P>I dunno this isn't a flame, but a lot of you people coming against the people who are desiring more AC and hps seem to be lower than 50.  Ok fine take the "high ground" as you will, but man it really sucks to work yer butt off all the way to fifty, then HAVE to stop cause yer just not wanted.  And trust me Post fifty it's HARD to get groups as a ranger, it's not cause they don't have anything special to offer...it's just that they are way watered down druids and warriors.  Not enough of either to create desire.<P>I never really took the skills into effect. BUt I saw the balance this way (leaving out the casting end cause really I think that could stay the same the ports are just bonus hehe)<P>Warrior= All weapon skills, duel wield, All armor<BR>         (excluding class specific) and all melee <BR>         skills def and off.<BR>Paly and SK= More defensive types so all the armor<BR>             all weap skills more focus on the def<BR>             melee skills, but no Duel Wield and <BR>             no kick<BR>Ranger= The damage machine of the hybrid duel <BR>        wield, kick, all offesnsive melee skills.<P>I think that if you brought their defensive skills up to the Knights OFFENSIVE skills (NOT defesnsive since that is the knights forte), and made their HPS comparable to a Paly or SK, then that would be good balance.  Then to me they'd be looked as more of a magic alternative to a rogue.  Yes I know that makes classes more the same, but seriously bud they need to kinda do that in some way or another.  Basicly so when people want a rogue in their group they can see a ranger and go oh that's an alternitive, and the ranger cann play the game and enjoy it as a ranger.<P>I dunno guess i'm not a role player, but i'm not all that much of a power monger.  My only desire is to make this game fun and accessible to ALL who play the classes they WANT to play not HAVE to play just to enjoy the game past a certain point.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Nammy, and others,<P>Ok, maybe the way I wrote my post is was easy to miss my point, and I apologize for that.<P>As many posts from rangers will attest to, they are getting hammered by mobs agro’ing on them which the warriors can not taunt off of them. This is because the code that determines agro, or ‘Hate’, is based on the number of attempts to hit the mob, instead of who is actually doing the most damage. The code is broken, but would take more cost in time than most people understand, and to fix it would change EQ at it’s core.  Rangers in EQ (and most fantasy settings) wear lighter, more flexible armor. Their defense in fantasy is their agility. My main point was that if you ‘fix’ the problem of agro for ranger in EQ by increasing their defenses (dodge, parry, reposte, the Defense skill and/or their agility affecting those four areas), you actually just ‘happen’ to be following the ‘fantasy role’ of rangers at the same time. Currently, rangers actual Defense skill is cap’d at a max which just happens to also be the max cap for druids, shaman and clerics (not positive on clerics). This makes absolutely NO SENSE AT ALL!  Rangers’ caps on dodge parry and reposte are also all way below that of warriors. <P>How in the world does increasing rangers’ Offinsive skills (as was done as of latest patch) even remotely ‘fix’ these problems? Rangers are 4th in line for damage output behind warriors, rogues and monks. Do we, or Verant really want rangers to start doing more damage than warriors? And still have the defensive capabilities as druids?<P>Nammy wrote:<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;EQ is a group game will always be a group game infact post fifty most of the major things take multiple groups.

I am simply advocating that BEFORE Verant comes up with another clugy ‘work around’ like the Jolt spell, why not try something that is much more simple to change and maintain such as upping the defensive ability max’s of rangers? All that is required to test/fix this is change a number in a field, no need to change existing code, write new code or create an new skill or spell.<P>This seems so straight forward to me. I just do NOT understand how their course of action addresses the agro problem for rangers. It simply makes it worse.<P>And for those of you that want personal ports so bad? I suggest Verant make a new button on the patch screen… ‘Rangers Optional Patch’.  If a player down loads that patch, they can use personal port spells, but they don’t get ANY fixes to the agro hate list problem and no increases to defensive abilities…. Port all you want, you’ll just have to deal the fact that high level groups won’t want a ‘ranger mana sink’ such as your self.<P>Oh, and yes, archery is all but usesless.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif"><P>Hopeful, but still /cringing,<BR>Kynoss<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I dont even know if EQ staff will come to read these responses after the patches but i would just quickly like to add my 2 copper. Please just tell me if Rangers are supposed to be a Priest class or a Melee class. I know its a rhetorical question but my God, why do the Priest class still have equal or better defense than a Ranger, Im not sure about the Cleric class but they get Plate armor. And dont even try to compare the other Melee classes defensive abilitys to Rangers. Its a Joke....Im not talking about letting Rangers wear Plate people just a increase in Defensive caps to 230 or 235, Whats the big deal, explain to me how this is going to make the Ranger class too powerful. The patch concerning Rangers was a for the most part a joke, with 1 or 2 decent bones thrown to us.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It looks like druids are going to have a tracking skill cap close to or equal to ours. Since Rangers are supposed to be the masters of tracking and not druids or bards, I would suggest that the tracking skill cap for rangers be pushed up to 252.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000668-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000668.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000668-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000668-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000668-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000668&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000668&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
