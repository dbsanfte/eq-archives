</FONT><HR>Nice post Atrian except the 44 pet does some decent damage (I logged over 50 fights with snow cougars while I was camping for Lodizal a couple weeks ago and the pet ended up doing MORE damage than me) we should get an offensive upgrade instead of a pet upgrade instead (I realise were defensive but when your pet was able to outdamage you... btw I was using an exquisite vleium brawl stick with peg belt/capt nalots quickening for haste, pet had none), like you said removing the skin line and replacing it with the shielding line (giving us minor-arch) would help.  Harmshield is also something that would raise our efficency as you put it by good deal, and would probally still be the better choice to use instead of a defensive type discipline because even if we had the damage reduction were still lacking the hit points, the other thing being the lich line would be great, and if drain soul when we get it (if not ill just live with drain spirit) has its casting time reduced enough to be useable in battle this line would help alot with our efficency</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My roleplaying view of sk is to protect team members as casters and help monk to pull mobs.<BR>So i dont think that sk need to be a damage dealers as rogue monk warriors and paladins.<BR>Moreover i think that SK will have more closed combat  spell oriented than necro kitting oriented.<BR>So i think that add some spells with vampiric effect( hp, stats, AC steal effect) will help sk to suit with idea of what a sk must be.<P>Your pet (walking dot) is just good to taunt a mob when we are medding.<P>Your weapon specific line is limit to darkReaver ( perhaps a multi quest as monk with headband   can help us to get some better weapon).<BR>Lots of sk use a 1HS and a shield. i think that some 2HS with AC will help to fix it.<P><BR>Sk cant deal damage as monk , rogue or warrior do.<BR>So Sk role could be to pull and protect caster but your defense,taunt and bash skill will need to be increase.<BR>In other hand , if sk may have some abilities to pull, i think that the cast time of feign death should less longer than FD of necro ( i see necro FD as an ultimate chance to survive)<P>HT should be see as a lifetap/vamiric touch and have a heal conter part ( or a discipline could turn the heal part on ).<P>Add a usefull shield line spell with resistance to spell bonuses ( to help sk to pul mob and protect team members )<P><BR>Thanks<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just a thought here.  I have noticed a lot of people would like the idea of a skeletal form, or ghost form for the SK.  I kind of like the idea myself.  Something that would be part buff, part illusion like druid wolf form or necro lich form.  Of course there are considerations on which graphic to use and not to take a unique look from necros, etc.<P>So would it be possible to have a "phantom form"?  The look would be to take the image that would be displayed normally, but apply a certain level of transparency to make you look like a "ghost".  So you would look like yourself, in your armor, but in the same style as a spectral mob.<P>I know, it doesn't have much to do with balancing, but it is a neat idea.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here are my opinions based on: what I have experienced through 41 levels, what I have heard and seen , and what I agree with from previous posts.<P>1. Upping the offense skill cap for Shd to be the same as warriors is wrong.  Warriors are made to inflict melee damage.  Upping defense skill cap for Shd to be the same as warriors is right.  Shd's have hardly any defensive spells, but rather offensive. This is balance.  <P>2. Upping the piercing, 2hb, 2hs skill cap for Shd to be same as warriors is right.  1hb, 1hs, wrong.  Again, warriors were made to inflict skillful, massive melee damage(florentine fighting style is the calling card of War/Ran).  <P>3. Upping bash skill for Pal/Shd to that of warriors is right.  (remember there are MANY more Pal/War shields than Shd. That is another issue)<P>4. The delay for bashing with arms for large races should be lowered.  Delay for all shields should stay as is.<P>5. There should be more SK quests.  Quests could be given in the Innothule/Feerrott areas, Paineel, Nektulos, and Qeynos Hills/FP(or EC).<P>6. Riposte/parry/dodge caps should be upped in general, except for warriors, who were given the most concern. (more people play warriors than SK's)<P>7. Str should give a larger damage bonus. (for all classes including Shd)<P>8. Casting times/recast times should be lowered for SK's because they are difficult to cast when tanking.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>To the above poster.. Although I do not belive that our offensive caps should be that of warriors or rangers you do need to realize that even if they were the same we don't have dual wield or tripple attack.

</FONT><HR>We taunt better than any meleer we choose to group with.<BR> <BR>Why on earth would I want upgrades to any of my weapon skills? The cost would be in Verant's eyes a lack of defense to "compensate".<BR> <BR>Bash is defense. Bashes stun. Stuns mitigate damage. Shields up my AC. AC reduces damage as well. This is good. Upped weapon skills just mean I do more damage. If I do more damage,Verant won't give me defensive skills,and I NEED them to live when I hit 50+.<BR> <BR>Give me the defense to tank and the spells to do the damage while I do so,and the spells to allow me to survive close combat. The increased casting speed is a great step towards this. A top-cap Defense skill also helps. Add in Bash,Parry,and Dodge and I'm a happier SK. Riposte would be even better-since we fight longer times with our style,we'd get in more ripostes,which would help compensate for overall lower offensive skills over time.<BR> <BR>Again,the name of the game here is BALANCE. SK's are solid at lower levels. If we get a bit better making sure that we function ALL the way up as a benefit of balancing both SK's AND what we fight,as a class we're set.<BR> <BR>We have a chance to temper the class into a unique and viable class-within the limits of reason and the game engine. Take it,but it's not going to be a fundamental reworking of SK's. Think of ways to improve what we have to fill the gaps in the class,not things that will have to be grafted on.<BR> <P> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, great idea's on what you have mentioned, I like all the item's you have suggested.  I would like to see peircing skill given the same cap as the other weapon skills that we are able to use.<P>Lastly as a final wish, if shadow knights at 60 could have their disc changed from leech curse to the evasive disc that warriors recieve at 52. This change would help out ALOT more then the disc we currently have.  I have used it all of ONE time since I bought SoV. This would in no way change the fact that warriors are the masters of tanking, but would only give the SK the ability to tank even if for 3 minutes or less, that much more versatility. <P>I would also contend if we get it, Paladin's should be able to make the point that they should recieve it as well.<P>Thanks much, and have a good day.<P>Level 60 TSK<BR>Member of Da`Kor<BR>Emarr server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There are only a few things I would recommend.<BR>First: Make Harm Touch a lifetap spell, since SKs are defensive, and HT doesn't inflict enough damage to really 'harm' most mobs it should at least give us some hitpoints back.  If gaining 800 or so hitpoints back is too much then make it regain 2/3rds or so hitpoints of damage dealt.<BR>Two: I really like the idea of giving weapon specialization.  It would allow a SK to better do damage (fairly)<BR>Three: Possibly look into giving SKs and / or Paladins the ability to wield a shield AND a 2h slash weapon. Or allow special quests to get shields that could be used in this manner. "So an so will craft you a special shield yata yata yata . . ."<BR>Four:  Give us the ability to make our pet dance, since it doesnt do any damage in combat we might as well have fun with it.<P>Twollotta Big'Luvin <BR>Troll SK of Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>So it seems that sk will not be getting any more offensive skills, fine in that case give us some spells that make up for it. After all with spells we should at least match a warrior if not surpass one (i mean when we use our spells) currently though this is NOT true.<P>1. Vampric Embrace needs to be completely redone<BR> a)casting cost X5 and duariation X5 , as it is now u have to recast it almost every battle making it very anoying.<BR> b) The amount vampric Embrace drains for shoudl be equal to HarmTouch damage divided by 10. : As of now my lvl 37 DE SK procs vampiric touch about 1.5 times per battle and the pathetic 19 damage that it procs for makes the spell almost worthless.  Cmon my SK hits for an average of 40s to 50s and gets hit for at least 60+, 19 damage is nothing at that point.<P>2. All SK spells especialy the lifetaps and DD should be redone. Id like to see a SK be able to drain his mana for one battle on spells and do VERY nice damage that one battle, as well as gain some life. What this calls for is life taps that can be cast in between swings with out interfering with melee. So we need lifetaps that hit harder and faster, and cost more mana<P>3. SK are NOT palies nor clerics, WE DO NOT NEED DISPELL UNDEAD TYPE SPELLS!!!!<BR>Replace this whole line with either poison, deases or lifetap dots.<P>4. Finally SK needs more self only buff type spells maybe a upgrade to Grim Aura, and other stuff along that line. As of now sk have all this mana and all its good for is fear kiting when solo or FD when gruped, paladins and rangers both get healing spells and buff spells, even if there heals and buffs are weaker then a cleric or druid they are still alot more usefull then our lifetaps or dots. <P>5. On a minor note just for RolePlay value SK could get a AE fear spell.<P>I really liked the changes i saw on the test server, the pet buff and the Defense cap are two nice size steps in the right direction.  But switching the spell lvls around wont solve much, it dont matter what lvl we get a spell if its useless. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It's pretty late in the game for new ideas..  (If these are in fact new.. This thread is beyond long and I've not read all of it.)<P>Anyway, I'm trying to think in terms of changes to the SK class that a) would help the classes survivability, and b) would stay in tune with the vision (and reality) of the dark knight the SK is.<P>Ok Necromancers are born to be liches.  They control army's of the dead (well one badass collection of bone chips, anyway), and their role is to sit back, rot, and drain the life force out of every creature they find.<P>With SK's being necromantic/warriors I envision them as the knights of darkness.  Who else but the vampire fits this description?<P>Whereas the necromancer experiments and plays with all aspects of death and disease, the vampire exists for one sole purpose... To feed.<P>Ok, with this in mind here's the reality of the situation..<P>Hybrids in general are lesser version of warriors (in hp and attack ability).  This is made up for in different ways for each class.. Rangers have weak hitpoints but are the quisinarts of the forest.  Paladins have lower damage but can pretty much heal themselves, allowing them to stay in the game almost twice as long without assistance.<P>SK's are also defensive tanks in that we don't hit as hard, but we taunt very well and are meant to hold the mob's attention while other classes chew it up.<P>The problem in my eyes is that our spell selection is not focused at all towards what it is we do or what we're about.<P>Although it's too late to change I don't really think we need pets.  Our pets are basically a DOT with legs.. Like all our spells they're about half our level so they're generally better against low blues than whites, yellows, or god forbid reds..  <P>We have a smattering of DoT's that taunt well, but aren't very focused.. They're hard to get off, and most seem to feel that in the time they're cast we can do more damage with our weapons.  Other than that we have a mix of useful/useless (or at least oddball) utility spells.<P>Now with pets and DD spells I understand the concept of keeping the spells gained at half the level of what an equivalent caster gets.  A pet at equal level to an SK would probably make the SK feel secondary to the pet, and overpower the character.  DD spells are designed to do damage in line with what any other class might be doing (theoretically).. So if a warrior could pop off the damage of a wizard while beating up the MOB with his twig of mighty thumping, that would be off balance.<P>DoT's on the other hand are not designed to be devastating by themselves.  A necro's DoT's are deadly because they are stackable.  He keeps the creature off him and piles up 5000+ damage in maybe 5 spells.. Then he just has to stay alive while they take effect.<P>If a necro only had one DoT.. Even a really good one.. And had to chain cast it, end to end, to kill a creature.. He'd be dead long before the creature.<P>Well SK's have a situation similar to this.. They have One or two lines DoT's instead of half a dozen, that don't really hurt the mob as badly as the damage they'd do just fighting anyway.  What's worse.. These DoT's are about 10 levels behind the power of the MOB they're expected to use them on.<P>What I propose is a change in the spell line that would in line idea of SK's as taunters, defenders, and life stealers...<P>One (this is old): Make HT a lifedrain at exactly half the level of an equal level paladin's heal.  (In other words if a paladin heals 500 pts at level X a level X SK does 250 damage and heals 250 points).  How this could be out of line or unbalancing I do not know.<P>Two: change the SK's DoT lines to things that add utility to the character and fit the vision:<BR>Darkness is perfect.  Vampires often beguile their opponents before going in for the kill.  But the rest?  Disease (Disease Cloud and Asytole), that's not us.  Heat Blood?  Heart Flutter's nice in theory.. But we only get the one spell.  <P>We're vampires.. We drain the life power from our foes and use it to beat them up!  All of our offensive/defensive spells should be in that vein..<P>The spell line that's missing, and would fit more than any other is the LEACH line..  Being able to sap life from an opponent is one unique ability that is not out of line with who we are or the power we should have.  It's also the DoT that makes us most group friendly.. Darkness is often overridden by snares, and thus useful for solo but not as useful in groups..  The other lines are too small and go unnoticed (and often are less useful than just plain attacking)..  Lifetap extends the life of the person who's purpose is to taunt the mobs.. Hurts the mob.. and lessens the amount of healing the clerics need to do to keep the SK going.<P>Now I get the feeling that Verant was afraid they were going to overpower SK's creating a tank that has no downtime, but this simply isn't the case.  Give a SK leach spells, even at the same level as the necros.. And they're still going to get beat down severely.  The leach spells are designed to mitigate the damage a necro does to HIMSELF in the course of a combat.  No spell in the game will mitigate the damage a like leveled mob does.<P>Ok, after all that ranting that's my suggestion..<P>SK's are the vampire knights of EQ.  They don't need DD, increased damage, or in my opinion even pets.  But give them say darkness and leech DoT's of comparable level to the necros who get them (feel free to remove the other DoT's that don't fit the class), and I think you'll have a class that people can sink their teeth into.. (Ba dump bump).<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Hello, I have been playing a Shadow Knight since nearly the day this game started. I love the concept of the lawful-evil type class that wears armor and uses swords in addition to spells. I play a human SK and have a lot of fun playing the class. I would love to send in some ideas on how to change the class. <P>1. Druids the parent class of Rangers give rangers the wolf form spell. A spell that adds running speed and attack rating in addition to....well turning them into a cool looking wolf for roleplaying. <BR>Necros get spells that turn them into skeletons and although the side effects of those spells wouldn't benefit a Shadow Knight I belive Sks should get a variation on the spell for roleplaying purpose. As opposed to HP-Mana or attack rating and running speed, I belive they should make a spell that is HP self drain-Attack rating and self haste. Kinda like an intensify death self only spell. We don't really need the intensify death spell for our pets. I wouldn't waste the mana. But if we could cast it on ourselves it would prove much more useful. Might want to drop the shroud of hate spell to even it out. That spell adds so little attack rating it is negligable and it isn't useful as a taunt like shadow vortex so it is somewhat useless. <BR>If this isn't possible how about just plain Illusion Skeleton for roleplaying sake. <P><BR>2. Drop the somewhat useless heat blood, boil blood line. The damage generated it so low at the level it is given one melee during the casting time and outdamage the DoT. For the most part the only DoTs a SK would cast we be used only for the effect(snare, debuff, or taunting power) and the negligable damage done by the DoT only a minor non-intentional bonus. <P>3.  In the end if you compared a SK to a necro or warropr you notice small problems with balance if that is what you are looking at. We are supposed to be a hybrid with a Warrior and Necro. Necros have high damage tank pets along with high damage DoTs. Warriors have high Ac high HP and high damage yield. If we are to be a mix of both of these classes we should still have high damage yield when you add our melee damage and our spells. A necro does more damage than a Warrior by far due to the pet does roughly the same damage a warrior does if not more, and the pet can tank to a high degree. I say we should be a mix of warrior and a necro, yet we still do not have the high damage yield that should be be somewhere between a necro damage yield and a warrior damage yield. We sacrafice AC for the extra damage afforded by the necro spells, yet the necro spells given to us are as far as damage capacity, utterly useless. I agree that Sks should not be given duel wield(it wouldn't be good for roleplaying), but I think that we should be given superior skill in 2 handed swords as we are supposed to be more offensive than paladin yet we do no more damage than a paladin and we lack the buffs and healing paladins provide. The additional 2 handed skill would move SKs from using swords and shields and should make us superior to warriors as 2 handed swords, as is, do not compare equally to a warrior with 2 1 handed weapons. If not this then I belive that several more SK only weapons with much higher damage output should be implemented to even out the massive loss of both defensive and offensive capability SKs have in comparison to it's parent classes or any other class for that matter. Hell monks and some rogues have higher AC than SKs do with DOUBLE the damage output and even if not more evasion capability (i.e. Feign without a 15 sec recast time, and hide/sneak). I do know that the warriors belive that they should be the masters of armed combat and I can agree with that. To keep them appeased, make several more  powerful SK only weapons(A way to make more useful weapons would be to log a level 60 warrior using 2 one handed weapons and a level 60 SK using a 2 handed sword and raise the damage ratio on the 2 hander until it evens the damage done by the warrior. Equal ratio's alone won't due it because of 1 handed bonuses)and mabye new FA quests that change depending on the diety of the Shadow Knight.<P>4. Make the drain on the Vampric Embrace proc for a Shadow Knight equal to that of a necro. What does a Necro need to melee for? This spell is an excellent idea for a Shadow Knight, yet the damage done/healed is so small and it goes off so rarely that it is pointless to cast. Mabye if you had it proc every swing it would be useful but otherwise.... not much use. <P>5. Different spell effects on the pieces of Blood Ember. There aren't that many high level suits of SK armor. I just now finished my suit of Noctivigant and I do enjoy the 90 pt heal on the breastplate but it is GOLD; NOT very evil looking(I keep getting asked for buffs). Blood Ember looks awesome if not a little undecorated. The effects on the Helm, Bracer, and Legs are totally useless. Deadeye? I have Shadow Sight by the time I am high enough to cast it. Gather Shadows? I could mem the spell and cast it twice then remem another spell within the casting time on the Bracer. Ok this is the kicker....Feign Death with double the casting time. Ok we are taking a spell that fails 75% of the time when under attack(when you would need it) and DOUBLING the casting time.....pass. I think the effect on the Helm be changed to permanent Deadeye or Shadow Sight. Effect on the Bracer should be made instant like the Crown of Shadows effect. Lastly the effect on the legs be changed to Death Peace or mabye even Gate.<P>6. More roleplaying quests and diety specific items. Our FA quest weapon is called "Innoruuk's" Curse. I don't worship Innoruuk, I worship Bertoxxulous. Change the name on the Soul Leech, Dark Sword of Blood to just Soul Leech. The sword drops off a god and yet the proc on the weapon is so useless now that you nerfed it to the same proc that comes on a bloodpoint. It isn't the dark sword of anything. Mabye  the Dark Sword of licking blood off the floor(Cause it isn't doing any real damage in combat). The sword was nerfed because people were soloing Lava Beetles. Well the sword should never have been allowed to be used by warriors and SKs are supposed to be able to solo without having to go outside and kite like a ranger(but with fear instead). The sword should have been SK only to begin with and the sword should still do a 280 damage Drain proc. <P><BR>Well those are just a few of my thoughts on the class. I am a very well known, very old SK and I am tired of feeling totally useless when compared to even level people of other classes.<P><BR>Forelorn Nightedge level 54 SK Aynoen Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I may be going a little off topic here, sorry about that. I just want to point out that Charisma is extremely useful to Shadow Knights. It helps Feign Death to be more Believable. I suggest you test it out by getting a charisma buff from a chanter or shammie and see how FD pulling becomes so much easier....Also try lowering your charisma and test it out also.

</FONT><HR>Unfortunately, I haven't the time to read all the pages of posts, so if I repeat something, I'm sorry, but I felt that I had to post before this one closed on me.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>My main character is currently a level 32 Human SK, which I started after playing a ranger for a few levels.  One of the things that hit me hardest at first was the fact that my ranger had an extra attack (kick) while using a 2h weapon, but my SK did not.  I got over it, but still wonder why, every now and then.  Oh well.  But, from an RP perspective, I've always seen kicking in a swordfight as a sneaky way to throw the opponent off balance.<P>As for pets, I haven't used one in I don't know how long, unless it was to work up evocation.  The reason why is that they don't do anything.  I haven't seen my pet hit a mob since level 20. IMHO we could use a slightly stronger pet.<P>Spells.  I wholeheartedly agree that they take WAY too long to cast, due to the fact that we ARE involved in melee most of the time, sometimes in the role of main tank.  I think the mana penalty is a great explanation for a faster casting time.  i.e. We use more mana because the incantation was done hurriedly, so not quite perfect. Otherwise, why have a mana penalty.<P>Speaking of that, why do I Lifetap and use a bub of mana?  Seems like a lot for only 45 points of health that get taken away in the next hit, and then some.<P>Like the idea of frenzied undead discipline... we still die, so exp is still taken away, but maybe the group lives to fight on and win.<P>God specific spells.  Druids have them, why don't we.  I serve Bertoxxulous, yet I only have one plague spell, that I got at level 9, plus I get a penalty to poison and disease resistance.  You would think that the servant of the Plaguebringer would have a higher than normal resistance to these things.<P>I also like the idea of a single weapon specialization. I currently use a dark reaver as my main weapon, but find myself switching to a 1hs and shield combo to stun the casting mobs.  I've also found that this allows me to taunt more effectively, but would still like to be able to use my large sword with effectiveness.<P>As for intimidation, I like the idea, it could replace the fear spell in our lineup.  C'mon, we deal with the dead 24/7, just the mention of our name should strike terror into the hearts of strong men.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>That's all I can think of right now, already late getting back to work.<P>To recap:<P>Small race second attack while using 2h.  Need it.<P>Pets, stronger, between what we have now, and what necros have.<P>Spells, take too long to cast for our situation, considering we are getting beat on at the same time.  FD could be a little more instantaneous, please.  Not like monks, but closer.<P>God specific spells and saves.  Give us a reason to choose one god over another, etc.  <P>Weapon specialization.  Single skill.  Not unbalancing considering no dual wield.  More reason to use 1h slash and bash combo.<P>Fear me!<P>Praise Bertoxxulous!<P>Lothorn Lightslayer<BR>32nd Rank Shadowknight<BR>Children of the Craft</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>I would like to thank Verant/Sony for a wonderful product.  I have <BR>enjoyed playing this game for over a year now and would like to continue playing going forward.  There are a few minor changes I would like to see take place with the current shadow knight class structure.<P>If I may draw on the 'vision' (The evil twin to the Paladin class) that <BR>Verant have proposed for this class to explain some of the changes that <BR>I would like to see implemented for class balance.  Even though we are considered the evil twin, we are not identical nor are we polar opposites.  The weapons that have been available for SK’s post lvl 50 dictate that we are better at dealing out dmg then our twin the Pally.<P>Spells<BR>If you just take our line of spells and look at them, you will see only <BR>3 spells in the entire line that can be cast on group members (group <BR>friendly).  ITU, DR, CR (I am not considering Locate corpse nor summon <BR>corpse, either one of these are not group friendly spells, they are group already dead friendly).  Everything else, is either self only, or mob only.  What does this tell me?  That we are a utilitarian self only <BR>class.  Self supporting maybe?  If a few things were changed such as:<P>Lifetaps:  when we get the spells, the ratio of mob dmg to heal is <BR>extremely lopsided.  Either increase the lifetap or reevaluate the spell lvl that we can use them.<BR>Cast Times:  These are not appropriate for the higher lvl SK's, with <BR>the fizzles and interrupts that occur for hybrids very unlikely that we <BR>could get a spell off that takes 5 or more seconds to cast, anything <BR>over 2.5 seconds is not very efficient for shadowknights.  One of the best lifetap spells we can use is the lifeleech quested spell.  Unfortunately, the spell has a 2-minute recast time.  The recast time does not make sense due to the fact that we don't have the mana pool our parent class has.  I could only cast this spell at the most 3 times for a total of 840 dmg/health.  Is this really overpowering?<P>Resistance:  Our lifetaps are supposed to be a way of healing <BR>ourselves.  Mobs post lvl 50 have very high resistance towards our lifetaps.  I would propose we make the lifetaps less resistant higher dmg per mana ratio.<P>Self Buff Line:  AC for a SK is still very low considering platemail <BR>classes.  I propose we have a shielding line with AC/Hps/MR.  I can <BR>compare the line of spells with any of the hybrids, the fact that our line of spells are either self only and not group oriented, dictate personal buffs.  As it stands we have no MR/HPs/AC buffs, we need a line post 50 to accommodate class balance.<P>Harm Touch:  The changes made to harm touch are nice.  But, I would like to see us being able to harm touch a mob and do 1501 dmg without wasting a discipline to do it.  The limiting factor is the ability to only do it every 60 minutes.  If we have to use a discipline to do this, then change the length of time it takes to re-cycle make it 30 minutes.<P>Pets:  What can I say?  2 schools of thought here – a steady dot or useless.  Adding Mini Intensify Death is an excellent idea, I would like to also see an update to the spell for the post lvl 50 pets or make a quest for a new lvl 60 pet that will give us a little more dmg output for most situations.<P>Armor<BR>This is a very touchy subject.  We have the same AC on our armor as the plate wearing classes yet have the lowest AC out of all the Hybrids (sans Bards).  Primarily it has to do with the other platemail classes being able to self buff and the natural abilities of monks/rogues to not get hit.  I propose this is changed, up our armor or go with the spell line of self buffs I suggested above.<P>Blood Ember:  Nice armor.  But, the spells associated with them are very trivial.  I do not understand why is it that the spells we get with our armor are watered down so much.  A 10 second cast time for a lvl 15 spell is just wrong. The Blood Ember BP has major shielding.  This spell should be part of our line of spells see above for personal buffs.  Class balance?  I do not understand how shadow knights should get such a weak spell for the lvl attained (I would personally have liked to see a self only gate spell such as the one on the rangers breast plate).<P>Damage Output:  The weapons available to us dictate that we are better at dealing out damage then our twin the Paladin.  I still feel this is lacking.  This becomes a major issue post lvl 50.  I have yet to see any shadow knights make a major contribution on a high lvl raid.  I would like to see some type of weapons specialization to occur.<P>In summary, I would like to see the following administered to the shadow knight class:<P>·	Lifetaps – less resistant, faster cast time, higher dmg and mana ratio for lvl attained<BR>·	Harm Touch – change the need for a discipline to get 1501 dmg<BR>·	Pets – Add the pet buff line including a better version for post lvl 50 pets or add a new pet lvl 60<BR>·	Armor – Up the AC or give us a line of personal buffs<BR>·	Blood Ember - .  Decrease cast time for spells and/or change the spells.<BR>·	Damage – Increase the damage output – weapons specialization<P>I enjoy playing a Shadow Knight.  One of the hardest classes to play.  You hardly ever see mor than 10 50 + logged on at any one time on my server.<P>Icher<BR>Lanys Server<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>HARM TOUCH -&gt; LIFETAP<P>There are several very good suggestions I've read so far but the one I like most is to convert Harm Touch into a Lifetap. Even if it stayed at the level it is now (i.e. ~300 Lifetap at Level 30) I think it would be balanced by the chance of having it resisted like Harm Touch is now. Pallies heal WAY more than 300 HPs at Level 30 with their Lay Hands skill and need not fear having it resisted - also it's not self-only like the HT/Lifetap would be. Sounds balanced to me.<P><BR>THROW PETS OUT!<P>Yes, this is radical, but hear me out. (Note this does not apply to the 50+ pets, since those seem to be a lot more powerful compared to those of SKs that are not in their 50s. Balancing the high-level game is something different anyway, so just exclude that part from my suggestions).<P>Right now SKs get pets that mostly aren't worth summoning. They are considerably weaker than necro pets even before the necro proceeds to buff his pet - something a SK can't do. If I were a necro I'd probably find it quite offensive having someone walk around with such wimpy undead at their bidding :)<P>Since the SK pets are designed (most likely) to be a low-level DoT to increase the SKs offensive ability, replace them with offensive necro spells from the appropriate spell level:<P>spell rank 1 at level 9 (necro spell level 1/2): replace LEERING CORPSE with GRIM AURA<P>spell rank 2 at level 15 (necro spell level 2/3): replace BONE WALK with POISON BOLT<P>spell rank 3 at level 22(necro spell level 3/4): replace CONVOKE SHADOW with SCENT OF DUSK<P>spell rank 4 at level 30 (necro spell level 4/5): replace RESTLESS BONES with INFECTIOUS CLOUD <P>spell rank 5 at level 39(necro spell level 5/6/7): replace ANIMATE DEAD with SHADOW VORTEX<P>spell level 6 at level 49 (necro spell level 7/8/9): replace SUMMON DEAD with TORBAS ACID BLAST<P>50+ Spells: leave alone (as stated above)<P>Here's the reasoning behind every single one of these suggestions:<P>GRIM AURA:<BR>Yay 6 ATK self only buff. Not much, but at level 9 I think this would really help. Also something like Vampiric Embrace I can keep up all the time to have another nice spell icon in my bar :)<P>POISON BOLT:<BR>A DD with a minor DoT component - good for pulling/opening a fight or to help take down low-health runners.<P>SCENT OF DUSK:<BR>The most minor of the necro debuffs. Also good for opening/pulling and by no means overpowering since most likely another debuffer is around in your group - if not then SKs could shine with this little spell.<P>INFECTIOUS CLOUD:<BR>A disease based area effect DoT. It prevents mezzing of mobs after you cast it. Yes, the group enchanter will hate you if you cast this. Then again, you don't always have a group enchanter. And if you want a mess of mobs to attack YOU instead of those soft caster targets this spell WILL get their attention. They escape - you feign (in theory lol) and you get to be the hero of the day for once instead of the pally with his LH :)<P>SHADOW VORTEX:<BR>Drains 12 AC and gives them to you. This spell has 'Shadow Knight' written all over it. <P>TORBAS ACID BLAST:<BR>A 200ish DD - poison based. Sort of like what rangers get, just not fire based and less damage. Balance: A 200DD at level 49 is most likely not unbalancing even for a hybrid. It's just another way to reach out and touch someone you want to hate you (translation: another spell-taunt).<P>Overall none of these spells are REALLY powerful at the LEVEL we would get them. Sort of like our pets. Many SKs will want to kill me for even suggesting touching pets I'm sure, but overall this change would add to our versatility and take away the liability that comes with having a greenie pet following you around.<P><BR>FINAL SUGGESTION:<P>Have a login poll on these or other changes, but try to limit it to the accounts that have a SK of a meaningful level (i.e. 20).

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>First off...I agree with Malgorzata completely,  but there are some things that I'd like to add as well...<P>I think it is sad that we cannot Bind or Gate ourselves at any lvl in the game.  I think that somewhere mid lvl's like 30ish there should be a self-only Bind & Gate spell available.  Make it through a Quest, no drop even so it goes to the people who actually need it.  After all, its not like this is a high lvl spell.<P>As far as spells go I just think that it would be nice to see a quest spell at lvl60 for a new pet.  Necro's get a Spectre at 59, which I think is around a lvl 48-50 pet but not sure so don’t quote me on that.  Back to my point...Make the pet some sort of similar creature, not just a skelly, I thought perhaps some form of Ghoul would be nice, just a thought.  Again make the spell a no drop item so only the people going for the quest can use it.<P>I use the spells I get to the best of my ability and max my combat skill with them as I can.  One thing I do not understand is why Engulfing Darkness resists easier and more often than Clinging darkness.  I thought the process was as you get better spells, they replace the older ones b/c the older ones are not as effective/useless in comparison.  I mean after all, why would a SK use lvl9 Lifetap at high lvls when you have much more effective and powerful Tap's?<P>I think it would be very in character to add a SK only spell.  To me nothing would be more fearful than a Dark Knight in full armor, a big nasty sword, and a Creepy looking pet.  Why not try testing a Fearful Intimidation spell, where it would in effect root/snare the target in place and slow it down a bit, perhaps to a -5 to -10 across the board for Str, Dex, Agi...etc, again I think this should be for High Lvl's 50+<P>I am pleased with the way Verant/Sony has developed the game and making it to where no one class is just so far superior & incredible that nobody plays anything else.  A SK is a very difficult class to play, add that to a Dark Elf who gets stunned and is rather smallish and it makes for a very interesting game and.<P>A final note...It’s just my opinion but I think specialization should come in to play.  It’s my belief that if a Character is Defensive they use Blunt weapons.  If they are offensive they use Slashing weapons.  Let the player decide which they are going to be.  <P>Say at lvl 50, maybe even do something interesting with it.  After hitting the magic lvl where you must decide have a popup saying you have been summoned to a meeting with your guild master, go now? &lt;yes&gt; &lt;no&gt;  And play around with it, Greetings Dark Knight, you have a decision to make...Are you going to become an Unholy Knight fighting on the front lines of battle...etc etc etc...  If you choose Defense you use Blunt Weapons, you choose Offense you use Slashing Weapons and your skill cap is higher than before and you cannot use the opposing weapon any longer.<P>Who knows, maybe even do a split Spell listing for Defensive Skills and Offensive skill followers.  <P>Just throwing around some ideas.

</FONT><HR>Many interesting ideas have come forth in these talks over the lst while i guess ill add my 2 coppers aswell.<P>Alright the Shadow Knight is designed to be a Defensive Tanking class ( ie we are better at takeing hits then dealing them out ) with some melee ability )( we are better then many classes but all the other melee classes can surpace our melee dmg output excludeing Paladins of course they are about our equals in melee dmg output ). Alright i can deal with that but why is it the case that on many occasions ive seen non defensive melee classes ( ie rangers , monks, and rogues take less dmg from a mob that agroes on them then a Shadowknight or Paladin would take when agroed? ) the answer is simple yes our armor class may be higher then those of the other classes and we may take less damage pur hit but our ability to avoid the attacks of monsters is less ( our parry, dodge and riposte skills are less then those classes and therefore we take more hits that could be defended against ).<P>If our role is to be a defensive tank class then we should have our Defense skills adjusted to make us do our job ( up not only our defense skill but all the defensive skills that we have to a level where we can stand and tank a mob without beeing mauled ).<P>Our Disciplines should reflect both our evil natures and our role in a group.<P>Lvl 51 the discipline of the Resistant <P>Lvl 54 the Discipline of the Fearless<P>Lvl 55 the Discipline of the Unholy Aura ( I myself Hate this one yes it can do some nice damage but hey why do we need to use 2 skills at once Harm Touch should be affective anough by the time yer lvl 55 to not need to use a Discipline with it ) the should just up the Natural Harm Touch damage when you reach this level by the amount that the discipline increases it as a natural improvement and replace this discipline with something like the warrior discipline of Defensive.<P>lvl 60 the Discipline of the Leachcurse ( was a nice idea but not practicle in combat with the sk after all we are a defensive tank we miss alot on the high level mobs and because of that this disc is not effective a better version would be to make this disc act like the warrior disc defensive but on every repost add a 75 hp life drain proc that goes off on every repost even if you miss the repost attack ).<P>Ok now that ive talked about the discs id like to talk about the vision that all sk use 2 handed weapons. I myself think if they did a pole on what<BR>type of weapon style shadowknights prefur i am willing to bet that almost all shadowknights above level 40 would say use a good 1 handed weapon and shield. Its time that they took some notice of this and came out with some interesting 1 handed weapons to fill this role ( the particle weapon for both shadowknights and Paladins would have been a hell of alot better if they had the stats they do now but where only 1 handed instead of 2 handed ).<P>Heres something ive noticed that i find bad about the sk weapon selection. Almost all the weapons that proc evil spell effect ( ie life taps and drains or damage over time spells castable by necromancers that are 1 handed are usuable by Warriors, im sorry but why should a warrior be able to command the will of such a evil weapon such as these im sorry almost all of the life tap procing weapons can be used by warriors aswell as sk where the majority of our sk only weapons dont have evil effect procs like this ). A side note on this topic in no way do i feal that warriors shouldnt have cool weapon effects but i feal they should not have had effects on there weapons that mirror spells that shadowknights pay for with bad faction and other class drawbacks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I just want to make one small weapon request.<P>The Green Jade Halberd is currently 28 damage, 38 delay.  The 38 delay puts this weapon just below the 40 delay damage bonus.  I request the weapon's stats be changed to 29damage 40delay.  That would not raise the damage per second ratio, it even lowers it.  But it does put this weapon into the 40delay bracket.

And what skills are our "defense"?<BR> <BR>Verant speaks of us as a "defensive" hybrid. This should be a pointer towards which way on skill caps things are going to swing,as there's as many SK's posting for defensive cap boosts as there are offensive ones(if not more,IMHO).<BR> <BR>We're NOT going to get both.

</FONT><HR>"Raise our skill to match Warrior"<P>i Dissagree with this...<P>I suggest Raising our skill to a little below Warriors...  By only 10 points less... And Making Bash cap same as warriors...  Bash is a Defensive Skill to stop casters. not an offensive attack...<P>Here is my reason for my suggestion...<BR>We still lack in a few Def / Off Skills (IE: Dodge,Perry,Ripost,Double Attack) But raiseing our Melee Skills will decrese the number of Misses, thus upping our dmg output some...  Since SK/Pallys are limated by out other offenfive skills we can'r match a warrior/Ranger/Monk/Rogue Dmg output or even get close to it... And as we draw closer to L60 and Warrior/Rogues/Monks get Triple attack we fall behind even more in comparison to a thes classes and thay become More viable and wanted.. <P>Raising the Skill cap does not make us more powerful... just makes us more viable in upper levels</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>THE SHADOW KNIGHT AND PALADIN HAVE REALLY GOOD CLASS ONLY 2HS SWORDS.  HAVE YOU EVER SEEN BRAVE HEART? IN THE MOVIE, william wallace uses a 2hs sword, and sometimes, he hits someone with the butt of his sword!  WHY doesnt verant make a new skill called butt, and when you click on it, it does small damage, smaller than bash or kick, because we have mass damage from 2hs.  THIS SETTLES some of our issues with offense.  If we have this, the issue about not the hybrid class bashing, but getting 2hs swords will evaporate.  THIS IS A SIMPLE SOLUTION, though higher levels wont have a high skill in it, im sure verant can do something to change it.

</FONT><HR>While its good to see problems with the Sk addressed, and all the fixes recently im not sure they are going in the right direction. If the SK is a defensive-hybrid class why do only a few SK spells and defensive caps reflect this? my SK is lv55 and i couldnt imagine seriously playing another class (not one without FD anyway) so i think its fair to say with 170 days on the /playtime-O-meter that i have some experience in SK-ology and would suggest these changes:<P>-First, ditch the pets, while ok for soloing in wide-open zones they are difficult to manage in dungeon-like zones where trains are easily started and even when they arent so difficult, the extra risk factors these green-conning, mana-wasters present will never justify the damage output they do. summoning a green pet that will chase a running mob deep into sebilis and bring back 12 bok knights and jin shamans to the party is hardly the spell a "defensive" class seems like it would use. ive tried hard to put my pets to good use in many different situations but im disappointed by the results 90% of the time. <P>-Second, if SK is a defensive class, why cap their defense skill below the warrior? with capped offensive skills they will never come close to a warriors melee abilities anyway, why the fear that this will unbalance them and somehow make them superior, it wont.<P>-remove disarm, my SK's disarm is maxed and yet at 55 i can barely disarm a lv3 skeleton and to be honest im not sure why i would want to. <P>-the unholy aura /disc is stupid--i dont want to waste a /disc to enhance an ability that most people agree has always been too weak even after the recent damage increase (harmtouch) anyway. <P>-EQ encourages group play while discouraging soloing, yet they give a party little reason to invite an SK into the group over a warrior or a rogue (heh--i find it bizarre that a rogue can outdamage a "knight" in melee combat). they cant outdamage either of these classes, they have no group friendly spells and despite what theVision(tm) had envisioned the SK as, they are most useful as pullers or corpse retrievers--hardly "defensive" roles IMHO.<P>-give us a poison resistance spell<P>-give us the shield line of spells (minor shielding etc.) youd think a defensive type, hybrid tank class with spells might want to consider learning a spell that buffs AC and HP--especially since he/she will be pulling and meleeing<P>-get rid of dumb spells like shadow step, and those crappy "numb the dead" type spells --by the time we get them, they only work on green mobs and with blue and higher mobs, using them to pull is risky and stupid considering how often they are resisted. <P>-SKs get endure disease at lv30 -wish i wouldve had that 15 levels before when mummy's were a problem. i couldve buffed my group as well if we didnt have a cleric handy and felt like i was more than just 3/4 of a tank.<P>-whats with all the undead DD spells? if i wanted to nuke mobs id be a pure caster. they dont do any significant damage to the target anyway at the level we get them.<P>-give us dark pact at 15 or 22--with the bigger manapool and our job as a tank/puller i cant sit on my ass and med all day.<P>-un-nerf dark empathy for SK's --it could be helpful in a pinch and it should be able to heal much more than 30 hp. after all the SK is sacrificing hp on a 1:1 AND spending mana--dont add insult to injury by making me stand there and click that damn spell button over and over 500 times like a shaman using 'canabalize' or a cleric with a new manastone who feels the need to click it repeatedy at every opportunity.<P>-other spells like bashee aura and grim aura (the latter is still on test) should be offered at earlier levels.<P>-give us cure disease--duh that shouldve been a given<P>-why shadow vortex at 39? will that 12 ac tap do anything? i dont need uber-powerful effects, but at least a measureable effect would be nice.<P>-shroud of pain? didnt i get this spell at 39? only it was called shadow vortex? nice that they stack but im not loading, then casting 2 spells for 30 point ac at 50+ level.<P>spells to consider (possibly in nerfed or modified forms ): allure of death (at 39th or 49th), dominate undead (at 39th or 49th), shadow compact(at 39th or 49th), spirit armor or shielding (at 49th), scent of shadow (at 49th. <P>more to consider for lv51+ spells: screaming terror, call of bones, scourge, pact of shadow, corpal empathy, chilling embrace, counteract disease, scourge, venom of the snake.<P>Im sure most will see most of those as ridiculous because they will unbalance the game and make necros obsolete--hardly, most of these spells were being used by necros 10-15 before the SK and they have since recieved upgrades or superior spells, not to mention the fact that necro     (along with all classes) need no longer worry some stupid SKs green pet is going to pull a train of 20 froglok ghouls on to them because said SK cant accept the fact that his pet is useless.<P>I dont want to play some kind of super-hybrid. my intention is not to suggest that SKs should be able to tank like a warrior and sling 1000point nukes. what i really want is spells that are useful. spells that have a measureable result (ie a buff that adds 30ac instead of using that ridiculous shadow vortex/shroud of pain combo), spells that are logical-like cure disease--we're necro hybrids--we kill with disease, not die from it. Well rant over now -excuse the typos and stuff but im in a hurry--im going log on now and summon my lv52 pet in nektulos and send it around to K.S. skeletons from noobies (gotta have plenty of bonechips!)--who knows -i may even load up shroud of pain and shadow vortex and treat myself to a little buff...=)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I am very familiar with my class/race combination, and it's strenghs and weaknesses.<P>What I've read about what you're doing, and people's complaints about our class is a little bothersome, as with over 130days played time, I don't like the direction you are heading personally.<P>The biggest problem with the shadowknight I play is simple, my AC is fine, as being around 1040 with a 2hs weapon, and nearly 1080 with a shield, and depending on the circumstances, I use both, mainly using a 2hs.<P>In the year and a half that I've played EQ, I've never been a powerleveler, mainly doing whatever seems fun at the time.  I've participated in killing all of your Kunark Dragons, your gods, Yelinak, Dain, you name it. In a whole, I enjoy my class very much so, and the game.<P>In my honest opinion, the ShadowKnight needs more offense.  I'm one of the few SK's that use their pets often, I use my spells, I use everything you've given my class to it's extent.  Any battle, excluding Yelinak never lasts over 30 seconds, wether it's daily grindage, or taking down a dragon.  currently, the best DoT my class has is at my level is blood boil @ 53.  Around 600ish points of damage over 2 minutes.  Hence, for 300 mana, our best DoT does about 150 points of damage in the fight.  Not even worth casting.  Our drains are pitiful at best.  You could talk with any SK that's 55+, and I'd bet they still have lifeleech memorized.   It's fast casting, and deciently manaeffecient.  Our best spell for mana to hitpoints until level 57, but due to an extreme recast time, the only thing it's good for is buying an extra second or two until the cleric can get the Cheal casted in a difficult situation.<P>Over all, all you need to to do to make me happy with my class is either increase weapon skill/ATK, and possibly better lifetaps.  I don't care to get a whopping 60AC by level 60 for the increase of the defence skill, with a miss ratio over 50% in melee, I'd rather hit a little more instead.<P>Do you really think it's pertenant to give us back useless spells like voice graft, or spells like Diamond skin, that has a reagent of a 12p gem, and is about half as good as a Rune?  For a character that is supposed to be a "feared denzien of evil", I don't picture my assscratching self too intimidating compared to any of the duel wielding classes with rediculous damage output that you've now created.<P>Gozbax Da'Elfeetur<BR>58 Revenant<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I hope I responded in time that my thoughts maybe counted. Since there has been a huge amount of emphasis put on grouping from Verant you have to look at the class from the perspective of how it can contribute to a group. First though the defining features of a shadow knight is the appearance of warrior/necro. When compared to a damage dealing/absorbing warrior the shadow knight falls so short I wouldnt classify them as warriors, shoot rogues, and rangers can deliver more damage then a shadow knight a class by definition is a warrior. They have to have all the combat abilities of the full fledge warrior as it currently stands they arent even half the warrior (dual wield,kick,beserker frenzy,critical hitting). The balance for a shadow knight and warrior seems to to be simply give us higher pets,life taps, and harmtouch reset times down to like 10mins and here why: a more effective pet to offset dual wield, higher life taps to help us offset the warriors crit hitting (remember mana is limited so its not like we can cast continously but it inflicts damage not nearly as much as critical hitting and allows us to effectively see a necromancer type of skill that is useful. Right now lifetap helps so little compared to the mob that is inflicting damage that why try to cast.), and finally Harm touch reset time is so long that it is useless. If harm touch was useable once every 10mins then it would offset warrior kicking. Do those three things and you have a warrior/necromancer. It is balanced with the warrior and has useful but not nearly as powerful spells as a necromancer of the same level. Rearrange when a shadow knight gets other spells also. Damage dealing/absorbing shields need to come way sooner then they currently do. (Banshee aura helps offset berserking but again that offset comes from necromancer ability. Balance is again made while mixing two classes hehe.)   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, hope you look this over one more time? )<P>Just wanted to give my 2cps as well and haven't read all the post.  Sorry, if any of this stuff threads upon others.<P>As an SK player for sometime now, don’t have a clue as to what VI’s version/vision of the SK should be.  By increasing the defense cap do NOT forget about the defensive abilities and increase those accordingly as well Bash, Dodge, Parry, Riposte, Disarm, Taunt.<P>Getting rid of the inflated mana cost for pre level 50 lifetap spells is very nice.  That still leaves SK’s with the horrendous cast times for spells that do NOT do much.  As an SK player if the inflated mana cost is removed please do NOT forget to look into the cast time of those spells as well.<P>Last bit, there appears to be little group participation or not much group contribution or the lack of from the SK other then melee.  Not talking about the SK’s 40% (+.02% with pet) ability to melee mobs just the spells in general.  No buffs for group members no healing for group members, etc.  As VI claims that EQ is suppose to promote grouping but a glance at the SK spell list shows majority of the spells are self only.  Not going to list all the spells as seen VI should know them or be familiar with them, I hope?  <P>So, would it be possible to add new spells that could benefit the group but still remain harmful or deadly to the group as well the SK?  Here are just a few group spell ideas these spells are ONLY useable in a group:<P>&#61623; Vampiric Communion:  Spell siphons health, stamina and mana from target and shares with the SK as well as all party members.  Proc type spell just like Vampiric Embrace.<BR>&#61623; Yulp of Atonement:  Spell siphons health from group members and gives to the SK which then increases attack, strength, AC and adds haste for a short duration.  Spell works just like a Paladins Yulp spell<BR>&#61623; Demise:  Spell that creates a bond with all group members transferring damage done to the SK on to group members.  Functions in same way as Necromancers spell Pact of Shadow.  Remains constant till anyone member breaks the bond or killed. <BR>&#61623; Vampiric Dissolution:  Spell randomly siphons 1 character attribute from target and shares with the SK as well as all party members.  Proc type spell just like Vampiric Embrace.<BR>&#61623; Fey:  Group ONLY Feign Death spell.  This spell uses a LOT of MANA or all MANA.<BR>&#61623; Indemnified Malignant:  Spell adds a special damage shield to all members including the SK.  Any creatures to hit any group member will get stunned, damage done to the member is then transferred onto the damage shield of the SK.  The stun factor 1 sec/per 10 levels of the SK.  Buff type spell very short duration time limit or until SK’s damage shield is depleted.<BR>&#61623; Pernicious Yulp:  Spell siphons stamina from all group members and gives a damage shield to the SK also increases all resistances to SK for a short duration.  Spell works just like a Paladins Yulp spell.<BR>&#61623; Vampiric Internecine:  Spell randomly siphons resistances from the target and shares with the SK as well as all party members.  Proc type spell just like Vampiric Embrace.  <BR>&#61623; Martyr:  Spell creates a bond that then drains the SK’s health and stamina and gives MANA back to all group members much similar to Shamans Cannibalize spell.  Functions in same way as Necromancers spell Pact of Shadow.  Remains constant till the SK or group member breaks the bond or SK is killed.<BR>&#61623; Sacrifice:  Allows the SK to exchange places with a fallen group member or a group member exchanges place with the fallen SK.  5% experience loss to both members when used.  The exchanged member returns with full health, mana and stamina only works if a member is dead or SK is dead.<BR>&#61623; Apparition Metamorphosis:  Spell that changes all members into ghostly apparitions.  While in ghostly form members can NOT attack or be attacked however creatures WILL still see them.  Ghostly members are also granted with minor levitation for traps and pits.  Spell requires a component to use/cast (component does NOT get depleted) however constantly drains mana to use.  Spell functions much like Bard songs where members must be close to the SK to remain in ghostly form.  Component and spell could be a random drop or made as a quest.  Quest for the main component would involve other components that will then make up the final required item.<BR>&#61623; Quietus:  Spell creates a bond with members that magnifies damage to Harm Touch, when used drains all members health, stamina, mana to 10.  Functions in same way as Necromancers spell Pact of Shadow.  Remains constant till anyone member breaks the bond is killed.  Damage magnifier determined by health of members, full health when used equal full magnifier, etc.  If used when anyone member is at half health or killed including the SK, random death or death for the entire group.  (This might be to much but added it anyway)<P>NOTE:  Vampiric spells will overwrite each other except for the normal Vampiric Embrace.<P>These are just ideas as to where the SK spells abilities could be or go.<P>Speaking from a RP perspective, personally want to do without disciplines an here is why.  An SK may spend little or no time learning a new discipline however that would be a hinder to the magical skill knowledge trying to be possessed.  An SK would spend a lifetime to get familiar with the magic knowledge possessed  but never devote countless hours to mastering the magic.  Learning new spells to use in combat but never to master in addition spend rigorous physical training to improve current melee skills be it offensive or defensive.  It is the learning of new spells and continuous training that would hinder an SK’s ability to learn new disciplines and vice versa.  It is in finding that balance between might and magic that the SK spends his/her lifetime achieving and may never achieve it.  Only the most dedicated of SK's find this balance and becomes the most feared and famous creature to ever stalk the lands.  The SK’s ability to balance magic knowledge with combat skills makes him/her a deadly and fearsome adversary in any situation.<P>Thank you for your time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055531-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055531.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055531-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055531-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055531-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055531-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055531&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055531&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
