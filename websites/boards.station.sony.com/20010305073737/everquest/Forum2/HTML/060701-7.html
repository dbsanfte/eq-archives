</FONT><HR>well, checked the main board.  The tanks and healers seem to be quieter; so i doubt you hear from Absor.  And while the thread is now 6 pages long; there might not be a need to rinse and repeat some nice flowerly language and start a new thread, as this one has slowed. <P>Guess we get to talk about it in another month or so, unless Verant does another wierd patch they need cover fire for of course.<P>See ya in another month or so, then again after that, then yet again after that; until the next game comes out.

</FONT><HR>Driuds and Necros please look at the facts here.<BR>1)Winged death and splurt are unresistable and deal more damage then any other spells in PvP BY FAR in the game.<P>Just because they are pumicible does not mean that they are not effective, and you know it or else you would not be using them.  <P>Harmony and lower level dots are constantly used in prelude to a winged death to cover the first buff slots.  If winged death is not in your top buff slots YOU HAVE TO RUN!  There is no other way to win.  It is a complete trump card and that is why, it like HT, must be nerfed.<P>My two possible solutions are posted above.  1 of them keeps the dots very effective if the druid decides to stay and fight.  <P>In addition to the range rule, where the DoTer must stay in range of the person they doted for the dot to stay in effect.  I also suggest harmony be disabled for PvP, and all magical DoTs become overwritable instead of stackable.  Thus making current destructive tactics such as this unusable.<P>Arkons</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My perspective on PvP.<P>I've been on RZ for about 18 mo. now and have played a couple chars to mid lvl, one caster and one tank.<P>To me, PvP isn't about getting someones items or coins for that matter.<P>My desire of a PvP encounter is to evacuate an individual from the area.... property control.  What is most frustrating to me is to be pestered by the same individual every 5 to 10 minutes even though myself/group has won every encounter.  I suppose you could look at that as being like any other NPC spawn in the zone.<P>To me PvP is about removing an individual from an area because they ticked ya off for some reason...  stole a kill, caused a train, said something nasty, or for RP reasons.<P>Item loot from my perspective is just wrong, I don't understand the desire of anybody to maintain this.  Some arguements I've read suggest "nothing to lose" encounters would not be fun, yet mostly all we kill in this game is without risk of item lose.. eg, NPC kills.  Also, I'm not a random PK (yes, the PvP servers are for lawfully aligned people too) and I only PK those that have PKd or tried to PK me or my friends.  These encounters have rarely resulted in getting any item back let alone an item you may have lost, because they wear NO DROP or are without armor.<P>In my opinion, some of the problems recorded on this topic are related to item loot.  Zone camping, portal camping are in part because someone  wants to loot you and get your item.  This practice is done not for RP, or because you have offended them.<P>The penalty if a NPC kills you is exp loss, ie. x-amount of time.  The penalty if a PC kills you has potential of being much much greater.  Since PC kills have the potential to be very easy, the death penalty should be more in line with the NPC  kill penalty.<P>That said, I still feel RZ is the best server there is.  If nothing changes it will still be the best server though at times it gets pretty rough... but that is the fun )<P>My most important request as a result of these discussions, I ask, I plead, if changes are to be made that affect the operations of the PvP on RZ to significant degrees.... please please please give me an option to move elsewhere should those changes not align with my playing preference.  All other requests are insignificant to me compared to this.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First off WD and Splurt ARE resistable. Just not easily resistable. DoT's only do 66% damage in pvp(or about that). WD and Splurt are SOOO easy to pumice/nullify off if you don't know that then you need to be on a blue server.<P>About hard coding 4 teams on tallon. DON'T. I suggest you simply put in a code that makes the invul healer attackable by all other races for a short time or until they zone. So anytime an elf casts a benificial spell on a non-elf he/she becomes attackable by other elves for a short time or until he/she zones. That would give everyone a shot at taking down the invul healer and it would make them think twice before doing it.<P>Invul healing is lame. But if its hard coded out....I wouldn't be able to do anything with my guild anymore(the only short healer is a pally LOL).<P>Zoibrysi<BR>Necro of Tallon Zek<BR>Officer of White Dragons</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Selphie_CN,<P>How can you say that hard coded 4 team will ruin the server? I play on the dark team and it will make the dark teams fight more reasonable. I will still only be able (if the faction gods are good to my troll) to walk into the four towns on my own team in my characters life. The only people who would be effected by this change are the 3 teams that cross team. I might also add that the teams were never intended to cross team from the beginning, so if they stop it, wouldn't they be restoring the intended balance of the server?<P>You also noted that the dark team is more organized than the lighties.. Well, yes we are. But I don't feel that the dark team should be penalized for being organized and intelligent in how we use our team’s power. I would think that the reasonable option would be for the light teams to organize themselves, but I tend to find that lighties squabble amongst them selves more than they fight with darkies. Again, that's a problem that the light team has created and should deal with, not the dark team.<P>If verant creates a GvE or LvD server then that's great, but lots of people joined the team pvp because that was what they wanted. That's what most of the members on the dark team on VZ want. it's the people from the blue servers that don't want to deal with risk, or are afraid to be on equal ground during a fight because they are afraid they might loose that need the GvE. What kind of a coward considers 9v4 races a reasonable fight? That's weak if you ask me. If they do make a GvE (which I believe has potential) they should make it 6v7 to even it out.<P>All I’m saying is don't apply the hang-ups that lightie teams have to the dark team. We're doing fine and lighties could to if they took the pacifier out of their mouths for a while and actually got organized.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>follow up on experience loss as a penelty in PvP...<P>This would be damn hard to code, as it could be a serious tool of the grief players if done wrong.  It would require at least two factors to have a chance of being anything less than a nightmare:<P>1. the ratio of levels of the victors vs the defeated, factored by % of damage caused/healed to the amount of damage done.  Complicated to run the math, and I question where these values would be stored and just how they could be tracked over a period of time.  <P>2. A limitation on just how much exp loss a character could face, based on a percentage decay timer.  You get PKed, you start with a 25% reduction in exp loss, that decays 1% per x amount of time.  So if at 10%, you get PKed again, and it goes to 35% and the decay starts again, etc.  <P>These two factors combined with a decent Res Effect upon PvP death could work.  Alot of work though.<P>Above all else - one single change could do wonders to bring some sanity back to PvP on Rallos...<P>51% damage MUST be done to receive the PvP kill. <P>No more cheap ass wanna-be pks portal camping and thinking they are 'killa elite'.  I am sick of the children being given the false ego boost just cause there was no balancing point after Factions failed.<P>-tera<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I hope so much that one of TZ or VZ is converted (with a movelog of course).<P>Just because there are 4 races vs 9 races doesn't mean its not 5,000 players vs 5,000 players.

</FONT><HR>I started playing EQ on PvP and have never had characters on another server until recently.<BR>There have been plenty of times when I thought about going to a blue server, but with all the time I have spent on my characters on Rallos and the friends I have made, I just couldn't do it.<BR>I would love to enjoy PvP the way naked casters can, but because of item loot I need to bag my gear before I can even think about fighting back. If it was all about the spirit of PvP and not about the items, then make Rallos coin only. The people that say item loot is good are generally the ones that would like to take your valued treasures. "It's not about the item loot, it's the PvP that I want…" Yea, right! The people that say that have never had their best item ganked after they spent weeks camping it or questing for it. If you want to fight me for the PvP of it, you wouldn't care if you could loot me or not. You should enjoy the thrill of victory, not the BP you loot off me for your twink….<BR>Item loot makes Rallos a frustrating place to play. PvP should be fun for everyone, including those of us that want to keep the gear we worked so hard for without having to shove it in a bag.<P>Wyfovgog Ironforge<BR>Ring of Cobalt<BR>Reverant </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think a majority of people, if not all, have said that immortal/invulnerable healing is a major issue on TZ and VZ.  The contention lies in how to fix this problem.<P>GvE, or "Good versus Evil" proponents want the server hard coded as two teams, a Light and a Dark team.<P>Single team proponents want it coded as 4 teams.<P>4 teamers seem to all want it to be guild based.<P>Yet, all of them seem to agree that invulnerable healing is at worst an exploit and at best something very undesirable.<P>Verant has never taken drastic steps in anything related to pvp, with the possible exception of cancelling charm/fear usage on players and removal of egg shaped pumice, so I dont see them doing anything major here.  Maybe I'm wrong.<P>What I think is that a compromise should be reached that will please everyone.<P>The 3 team ("light alliance" or "good team") people want their alliances, mostly because of roleplaying reasons, and the fact they have played this way almost since the inception of Tallon Zek. They say hard coding the servers as true teams would alienate their playstyle. I agree, it would, but if it isn't done, invulnerable healing against 1 teamers still is possible and still will happen.<P>The 4 team people want the same thing. They have made an unholy alliance between all teams because of PVP, and ultimate PVE goals such as slaying uber dragons and creatures that have never been killed before (on TZ anyway).  They see hard coding 4 teams as a threat. Rightly so, it would dismantle their guild.<P>The single team adherents (99% of Darks "orange tags", and other single team guilds as HR, LOTU, etc) want 4 teams hard coded. Why? They play that way already, and they like it.  Is it in their self interest to have it hard coded? Yes, because then they cannot be invulnerable/immortal healed against.  <P>The root of these team problems is the fact that anyone that is NOT on a single team has an advantage which a single teamer cannot defend against or do anything about, unless they abandon their single team style of play for a 3 or 4 team style. Most single teamers would rather quit playing then do that.<P>I want to see invulnerable healing go away.  In my mind, the simplest solution is an Aggressor Team Flag.  If you heal or buff ANYONE not on your own team, it makes you attackable by any team for a short period, of say 10 minutes. This means that the person doing the healing is now hittable by their own team-mates, thus eliminating all invulnerable healing issues.  They can become fair game. Of course, faction issues are still a problem, but at least the offending person who immortal heals can pay for their treachery.<P>Instituting this Aggressor Team Flag also means that the PVE style of 3 and 4 teamers who have made alliances for various reasons, will not be affected in any manner.<P>The exploit will be over.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Some of these comments are just silly. "Fun" or "success" is determined by people in very different ways. Many people feel that loot is the be all end all of the game. Others feel that leveling is the ultimate. Some have fun with "friends" regardless of teams or GvsE. Some like the roleplay as the ultimate. etc.<P>You will not get agreement on these issues no matter how long you argue. Thus the answers really involve having multiple environments to choose from. There should be an item loot server, there should be a team server with no crossing, there should be a GvsE server. etc.<P>However, there must be a viable economic base to support a number of environments like this. Unfortunately Verant does not believe that such a base exists. At least not strongly enough for them to dedicate the resources to make it happen. This is the real reason that it has not happened yet.<P>So, unless you have the ability to bring enough players to the PVP servers to justify enough servers, split code versions, and means to enforce multiple sets of rules, you will not end up satisfied with the results.<P>Since I doubt there is a finacial basis for yet another PVP server, we should work with what we have now.<P>I suggest then that you start to define 3 groups of rules. Get them as accurate as possible and consult with the Verant folks to ensure that what you propose can actually be implemented in code in a reasonable timeframe. Then present the clearly defined options to Verant and let them poll of the servers to select the environment for each.<P>It is clear that Verant does not have the resources to do this on there own. You can either keep on complaining about PVP or you can help them do something about it.<P>This is the only real method of resolving many of these issues. <P>Oh, and if some ganker ruins your day, get your friends together and make him pay. Most thugs get off on preying on others, not being preyed upon. You would be surprised what you can do when you try.<P>So any volunteers to compile the rulesets? </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This time next week my guess is that we will  be looking at the two Team servers being reduced to one and the other being made blue. Verant are not interested in PvP, they do not like PvP, and certainly won't introduce anything to make PvP 'better'.<P>All you people who want 4 team reinforced as opposed to GvE, you are insane and your own worst enemy. You are going to destroy the server. <P>Without the cross-teamers to make up the numbers, Team PvP simply would not exist. Do you really think Verant will support a server so that the 300ish (an estimate I admit) hardcore Team players can play each night? You NEED the players who choose GvE, they are the servers lifeblood and provide the numbers it needs to exist.<P>Verant will next suggest a /movelog test like they did with coin only to see who wants to move to a designated GvE server (probably Vallon), the majority will choose to go. Verant will then say that the remaining server is either underutilised and abolish it totally, or that to save the effort of a /movelog both servers will become GvE. I suspect the abolishing of an existing server is the way they will jump, we all know verant hates the fact we have low server populations and dont earn them loot like the big blues.<P>You are your own worst enemies, but I for one hope it goes through and both servers go GvE. The nightmare situation (and the most likely) though of course is that they will herd us Team players onto a single server and convert the other to true blue.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It seems to me the easiest way to stop cross-teamin is to make it so that only people in your group can cast beneficial spells on you.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I play a Wiz on Vallon. <BR>Here's the biggest problems IMHO with PvP<P>1. The 8 level difference on The Team PvP servers. A PC who is 8 levels above me can continually kill me over and over, with less downtime than me, on the same note, If a person is 8 levels lower than me, I can kill him as many times as I see fit. No real challenge here. They should have to con something *OTHER* than red or green in order to fight then. If someone cons red or green, they shouldn't be attackable (maybe one level either way is ok). It's some what difficult for casters to beat a Melee Class 8 levels higher when no spells will work, on the same note, if I root a person 8 levels below me, they won't be going anywhere soon. I would suggest a 5 or 6 level gap, that would make for great PvP.<P>2. No Loot And Scoot Rule please. It's a PvP Honor 'rule' so it is said. But there's no reason I should have to be forced out of the zone because someone killed me once. If I am harassing someone, or someone is harassing me, they can be /petition-ed. Typically the ones who whine about Loot and Scoot are the scaredy cats who want to PK for money, and take very little risk doing it., After all, If you go into a zone<BR>killing the natives, expect to get a bad reputation. <P>3. Would it be possible for perhaps, one of the Servers to have PvP zones, rather than every zone being PvP. Perhaps certain zones should be Non-PK, particularly home towns for races, such as Neriak, North FP, Halas, Felwithe, etc.. This will allow players a place to rest at ease for a bit of time. IT would also serve to eliminate 'zone camping' in some instances. I play a Dark Character and I am not KoS in Freeport, if I wish, I could wander throrough the town killing Greens cons at my leisure-At places such as the bank.<P>4. Faction hit for PK's of same race, BUT please remove all faction hits in PvP arenas. Afterall, why can we not practice without penalty? Just because I best a person in a arena, doesn't mean I am becoming an enemy to my people. <P>5. Allow Spells to hit PC's just as hard as NPC's. It shouldn't matter WHO a person is, when computing damage. Just use the same math to compute damage in either case, or at least make it fair based on stats. A level 10 NPC warrior with the same stats as a level 10 PC warrior, should resist and take damage the same. <P>6. DON'T change the AoE effects on the crossteamers, on another PvP server that's light vs. dark that would be fine, but PLEASE leave this be on VZ and TZ. The crossteamers can deal with it. It's 4 teams on these server, please keep it 4 teams. <P>From my view the big problems with the PvP servers are the ability for someone to just kill you with no challenge whatsoever and get a reward (your loot) If The level gap is lessened, or the PC's are made non-lootable if out of a certain level range; that would fix this. If you don't get this, go play a 22-30 Dark Race on VZ in SK and fight the treants. The lvl 30-38 Lights will wait an hour and come in groups just to stomp for loot. NO challenge for them.. I have had one 'Uber Twink' wipe out a full group, just for the loot. And of course we can hunt elsewhere, but is that the point? The PvP is supposed to be a bit fair/fun and it's not that in many cases.. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

So are all the dark team and current 4-team guild members.<P>The current game world is split between light and dark sides, not the race divisions set up on the four team server. Typically, "good" team members are not KOS in good cites, and vice-versa.<P>My primary is still low-level (34), and I'm not guilded, but many of my rl friends are members of one of the cross-teaming light guilds, Knights of the White Rose, on TZ.<P>If such changes were to occur, I certainly hope that a /movelog would be made available, though I don't know where I would want to go.

</FONT><HR>Wow...<P>It's been months since I was here, and here I am.<P>ONE change, and this is of course MY opinion, but ONE change...<P>The person or group that kills a player in PvP MUST do at LEAST 51% of the slain players unbuffed hitpoints worth of damage to that player in a single encounter.<P>I have talked this one part over with many many folks and the logic is clear.<P>I don't mind if suddenly, in the middle of a zone that I am foolishly travelling alone through I get jumped by six pk'ers and die.  Ya, it stinks.  I travel with the combat gear bagged BUT a full set of resist gear on for these times.  It's like getting jumped in the park at night.  It COULD happen.  We all pray it doesn't, and in reality we shouldn't have to.  We don't have the ability to cast spells and hack our opponents either though!<P>This type of change, which would require HARD CODING on the PvP servers, specifically Rallos, would effectively stop the arguably most grevious activity there: The zone/portal gank.<P>There would be more escapes by the victims, at least in the loot department, so less incentive to gank.  It would encourage meaningful PvP more than removing item loot for sure.<P>For the most part, I think the classes on Rallos really are pretty balanced, but I have only risen to level 43 in the past 18 months there.  The post 50 game may be different.<P>I encourage ALL of you to post MEANINGFUL posts...not the typical name calling that the first page had repeatedly.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Since we can't edit, I have a few more things to post hehe. <P>Unresistable DOT's. The spells I have no problem with myself, they ARE BALANCED. They can do a lot, but anyone in range of either spell is smart enough to level that far, so will have pumice on him, or cancel magic up. All I propose is to make them easier to resist. As it stands, I have seen NO RESISTS of Winged Death, and ONE RESIST of Splurt. I have PvP'd nearly every day since kunark, are these odds right?<P>Coin loot issue - Unfortunetly, it seems the higher level crowd gets no say? That majority of players here are NOT in major high level pvp guilds, but just people whining for coin loot because of low level zone campers. If zone camping/corpse camping etc went away, then you would have NO REASON to whine about losing an item. I believe Grairage said it best. Whoever does the most damage should get looting privledges. If a mob did the most damage, then no one can loot, now, can they? Would this fix it? I'm most certain that you can't complain if you are nuked for 50%+ damage by someone. That's your own fault for not wearing resist gear when an known enemy is in zone =). All in All, I love item loot. At high level battles it is USUALLY err SEMI fair. Everyone has resist gear on, not their leveling gear, or no drop planes armor. I for one hate my planes armor, it has horrid resists (except bracers and boots). So when you loot that diamond ring from a corpse, you feel just great =). <BR>      <BR>         Peace,<BR>              Ach<BR>&gt;_&lt; tells you,  "How'd you kill me?

</FONT><HR>Dr_Fate,<P> I guess it's possible that the dark team outnumbers the lights but to tell you honestly i am having a hard time believing it. I would like to know where you get your numbers from.<P> I on the other hand (using some basic logic) would think that if there are about as many lighties in the 9 races as there are darkies in the 4 races, that there would be generally equal numbers of guilds on both sides and there would be equal numbers of large guilds on both sides. Granted this is a general assumption based on percentages. However this is not the case there are generally more lightie guilds and they generally have larger populations than darkie guilds. That is a fact, and it is obvious if you look at a somewhat up to date guild list on any web site. (there are lots out there for VZ) You are assuming that for every person that plays a light character (as a main character) there are 3 that decide to play a darkie. If you believe that YOU'RE crazy. That is absolutely wrong. I would like to see where you get your number for the 4 darkie races being equal in number to all 9 lightie races. Unless Verant posts some hard numbers i think you would be hard pressed to prove that to anyone that plays on the dark team. I think lighties use that as a convenient excuse to endorse cross teaming. If darkies did outnumber lighties that badly, please explain why Sebilis, Howling Stones, Cobalt Scar, Sol B, many other high level zones, and most of the planes are OWNED by lightie guilds? If we were of equal numbers and strengths, shouldn't the darkies own half of those?<P> I think you need to check out some facts before you make excuses for cross teaming... because that's all they are.. Excuses. Post numbers to prove what you say. Even I hear lighties saying that we are grossly outnumber but make up with it in organization. You can't have it both ways.<P>Gile Gutripper<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Basically here are the primary problems that I see on Tallon Zek.<P>1.  The Guides/GMs either do not have the power or the desire (maybe both) to do anything to the exploiters.  Warnings do nothing.  When there are several petitions a day about a person that does nothing but try to xp kill people yet the worst he gets is a slap on the wrist (if that), something is wrong.  I was even told a few days ago by a guide that she had received 5 petitions about a person that day because he continually stunned others in front of mobs until they were dead and they never had a chance to fight to save their own lives.  This is the kind of BS that Verant has to stop.  Most people truly don't care about dieing at the hands of players.  The most you lose is a wee bit of time and maybe a couple platinums.  I enjoy PvP action.  I'm not particularly good at it, but I do like it.  But if it comes to being crapped on by people that are 8 levels above me (AKA you haven't a chance at any level) or not playing, I'd rather not play.  <P>2.  Absor wasn't around (at least publicly) when TZ went coin only and the huge outcry that without risk, there is no fun.  This game in my mind is really not much fun any longer.  I realize that this is the normal progression that after playing the same game for so two years that some things would be difficult.  So the options for me are simple.  I play when I have nothing else to do and there is nothing I want to see on TV.  I'm impatiently awaiting the upcoming competition games to EQ.  Now, the reason that I'm ready to quit EQ isn't because of EQ, it is because of Verant.  I truly never expect to purchase another game that is put out by VI.  I think from a customer service aspect, we get no where near our money's worth.  The game is great and perhaps the greatest game ever written.  Sadly, there is not enough control over those people who's sole purpose in EQ is to make other's lives miserable.  <P>3.  I know a lot of people want the two teams servers to go to 4 teams.  We know that almost all of the dark quests do not involve having to go into any of the other teams cities, but a great deal of the lights quests do.  So, it really isn't logical for anybody to go and ruin faction with a race that they very well might need later.  This is another reason for GvE instead of 4 teams.  Not to mention that VI never gave us a storyline that would indicate why Elves and Dwarves hate each other.  And why the Dwarves and Gnomes sided, etc.  <P>4.  Class balance - basically there is none.  I play a class that post 50 I know of few people that are great at PvP - Shaman.  Its been stated many times that Poison resists are horrid and our DD is a very inefficient joke.  I've been killed by one spell (well 2 if you count root) by Necros, Druids, and Wizards.  I've seen a single Necro pet completely rip apart a group of people while the necro is floating around splurting everybody faster than we can nullify it off.  The PvP aspect is really not great unless it ends up in a good battle of groups where a test of tactics actually comes into play.  Personally, I think that all spells should probably be resisted less (other than lifetaps/WD/Splurt who should be resisted a bit more), but they should do less damage than they currently do.  Notice that I didn't talk about pets.  Shaman don't get pets, we get companions.  And all you have to do is see my green con pet miss and miss and miss against any tank my level to see that in a PvP encounter, they only give the aspect of distraction to the fight.<P>5.  Heck, I think that the following would be good for the PvP servers as a whole.  Make PvP not function from levels 1-9.  At level 10 you can PvP to your hearts content (that means nobody can hit you, and you can't hit anybody).  This would address the stupid newbie preying that goes on now that is responsible for probably 50% of the low level petitions.  I also think that unless VI does something to address the post 50 game, I'd rather not have the PvP aspect in it either.  Just because I know the shaman life well, I'll list my "Normal" scenario.  I see say an iksar monk.  I run up to casting range and lead off with e-bolt (resisted unless he's way blue) and then try and stick Turgurs (usually resisted as well).  Once he closes the gap, I'm dead.  The shaman spells take SO long to cast that getting one cast is a virtual imposibility.  Sad to say, but my best defense against a monk is to drink a damage shield potion and start healing myself while he kills himself punching me.  It usually doesn't work though.  Casters in general are easier to kill, but only if I take the offensive.  I'll never stick e-bolt on a necro as they always have DMF.  Do you know how hard it is to kill a level 50 necro while having to use cold damage spells that take over 5 seconds and a lot of mana and do about 300 hps of damage?  All of this with a necro pet trying to beat and cast the life out of me.  Lets just say that Shaman do not have the tools to compete in most 1-1 machups.  I make a lot of people run, but almost never get a kill.  <P>- sidenote - For all the people saying how easy it is to get rid of Splurt and WD, there is a certain way that you have to set your buffs, etc for that to be effective.  It isn't easy to keep them that way and if you are a buffing class (Shaman, cleric, druid, and enchanter to some degree) you basically can be dead by the time you get to the 10th or 11th buff spot.  Now, if Nullify took off damage spells before it took off buffs, then this would work.  As it is, only those that are out on raiding parties typically have their buffs set just right.<P>6.  If given the chance to move my characters from TZ to another server where I have friends playing, I would do it in a heart beat.  I would even go over completely naked and have no money if that was the only option.  I won't start over to move however, so that option is probably not realistic.  My thoughts are that VI doesn't have the fortitude to do the things that would make the PvP servers even as good as they were pre-Kunark.  <P>7. Lastly, define in print what the rules of engagement are.  There has always been a long list of interpretation as to what was acceptable and what isn't.  Is it ok to attack people that are engaged in combat? etc.  There are a ton of ideas that can be used on this to make sure that there is little room for interpretation.  Since most people truly do not know what is and isn't acceptable, make a /rules command that will bring up the general rules for the server.  <P>Well, I've gone on long enough.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
