</FONT><HR>Bump<P>I received confirmation that my order had been shipped on the 14th.  I realise I live in the UK but I send and receive items with a two day turn around all the time so fail to understand he problem here.  It is now the 20th and still no RoK.  We have a holiday weekend starting tomorrow so the earliest I am going to get my copy is Tuesday.  Sure enough they charged my credit card on the same day they received my order.<P>Thanks for nothing Verant. You guys couldn't organise a p**s up in a brewery.  Abashi should also be hung out to dry for not checking his facts before retorting publicly.  But this is no surprise I have yet to encounter another company who employs as many incompetents or who has a worse customer service record.  EQ addiction is a horrible condition. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>This idea is totally untrue. We are in fact offering refunds on shipping costs AND a free month to anyone that ordered by April 19th and doesn't have it by Monday April 24th. The idea that we're in any way trying to delay shipments is absurd (to say the least). We had a problem with our order processing software. It's as simple as that. It's ugly, we don't like it... but that's the truth.<P>John Smedley</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Overnight means OVERNIGHT right?&lt;Happy feeling has left and now Im grumpy!&gt;.<P>I understand shipping dates, cost effectiveness, publishing and getting out an order on time as well as CS. I also understand Credit Card charges on overnight deliveries that are not sent overnight when charged the hard way....<P>No need to reply on this board. I'll not have time to check back but I figured "hell, this MIGHT work"<BR>-- A guy who just wanted to have fun after work--</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I just wanted my two coppers worth here. (it's about all that verant is worth)<P>I ordered RoK the day it was available in the online store.  For some unknown reason it came back insufficient funds.  Might have happened, might not.  When I checked the funds there was plenty there.  The fact that it did not go thru was not known until I spent the 18th and 19th calling there oh so informative shipping line.  I sent an email to cs and that is when I was informed of the insufficient funds error (on the 20th). I received email notification that the transaction went thru and the charges to my account at 9:40am est today.  At 1:40pm est I recieved another email telling me that it did not go thru due to insufficient funds again. So I sent email back.  No reply to those yet.  I started dialing the 1-888-782-8466 and 801-579-2300 tech support numbers. Only to listen to busy signals.  At 8:15pm est I finally got thru on the 2300 line.  Listened to the nice elevator music for 25 minutes at which time the gentleman told me that my order has been placed (no eta on arrival date) and that the second email is in regards to my first order (no idea why it was sent).  To top off my wonderful evening they did a nice surprise patch again which I am still trying to download after 7 hours.  It is a good thing there are decent people in the game that I actually consider to good friends because NO GAME is worth the BS that verant dishes out and expects us to just accept.<P>Hope to see all of you in Norrath and maybe Kunark sometime in the near future.<P>Korinthal Orcbasher<BR>33rd Paladin<BR>Bristlebain Server<P>on a side note: at this point wouldn't it be easier for us that have gotten screwed on the whole shipping fiasco to go buy the game off the shelf?  it only cost a few more dollars than the overnite shipping and you would have it in your hands on Monday.  Instead of waiting 3 weeks for your overnite package to arrive.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>woops.  after rereading my post i realized i forgot to mentiont that i placed a second order on the 19th after finding out the insufficient funds error.  that is the order that went thru.<P>Also something that has been bugging me since it was stated by Verant.<P>How could you idiots over there NOT expect the demand for the software?  The last numbers I recall hearing were you had 200,000+ subscibers of which 120,000 play daily.  Those numbers could be wrong and may be excessively conservative.  Doesn't matter.  I get on at all times and very rarely does any server not have at least 600 people on it.  I would have thought you would have been paying attention when the christmas rush bumped servers from 1800 to 2200+ ppl on line.<P>Kor</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I'm in the same boat here. Almost the same situation as a couple of other posters (well, a couple on _this_ thread only. Heh.).<P>Order placed likely within a couple hours of the "store" coming online. Dum dum dum... wait until the 17th before getting a confirmation email.<P>Confirmation of what, you ask? Beats me. It's three days later and there's still no shiny new CD anywhere on the horizon.  Likely could have called to find out but, dang it all, there's a little something called work that gets in the way of that. So, all in all, I'm more than a little confused over the meaning of "overnight shipping". I obviously thought that it meant something considerably different than it does...<P>Oh well.  We'll see what happens during the day today (the 21st). Not that it really matters anymore, really. Whatever enthusiasm I had built up about the expansion has pretty much been squelched by this whole fiasco. Maybe I'll get to see something of the new lands in a few months...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>As usual Gordan says a lot about nothing, You Verant made a written promise &lt; contract &gt; to your customers that they &lt; us &gt; would recieve the upgrade on time for the release date. On all things a holiday, then come to us whinning about problems you are having. No you have no credibility you lost that a while back, no one takes you word for much anymore because most believe you are just blowing smoke anyway. You have not delivered on a promise, then give a number that has no one there. verant trys to be so secret it acts like school children hiding their toys. I think as some do Verant needs a little better pr dept. than someone that thinks he is god and could not give a straight honest answer if his life depended on it. just a view from a paying customer, remeber what that is Gordan, if not look at your paycheck and think whom it comes from.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

God forbid you can't play it the day it opens, oh yeah thats right so you can be on the continent with all 200,000 players that are going to try and start Iskars or take their high level chars over there.  It will probably crash from lag for the first three days anyways so you won't be missing much.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>First off, I for one was when i learned of all the problems they were having with shipping.  It never occured to me, however, that Verant is planning any kind of deception into staggering the shipping orders.  So you ask for answers and Abashi gives you one, granted not in the manner you wanted, but on the message board.  Well of course what he tells you isnt good enough because you have received word/seen screen shots of/ a GM telling someone that they are staggering shipping to help ease the pressure of the new zones that will be bombarded with what will mostly likely be Farmers/e-bayers(nothing wrong with that, if you can get paid playing this game more power to ya),which i personally see nothing wrong with.  Would you rather have the game on time and keep crashing because of overpopulation or receive the order a little late, get REFUNDED your shipping cost AND received a month free, and not have to worry about as many people at the entry zone.  One day will give people the chance to explore out into other zones, allowing the entry zone less congested. I for one am in no big hurry to get any special item first over anyone else, nor die at the hands of some new mob.  Well, you say, thats not the point, Verant made a promise that we would get the order on time and by golly, since nothing else has screwed up in my life, and ive received everything i was promised on time, then damnit Verant should not break this incredible string of good luck ive had all my life.  ok, so they offer us the before mention free month and refund of shipping cost for those who do not receive the game before release.  Well wouldnt you know it, someone has already posted that they are worried they wont receive their refund.  Come on people!  Do you honestly believe we would let them get away with not refunding our money or giving us the one month free.  It is all over 100 or more sites, saved in files, and any other way you can think of, the message of them refunding.  This is a dead issue.  It doesnt matter what some person saw or what their friends have seen or who saw what screenshot.  If you get the game before the 24th, everything is ok, if not we get refunded. Its as simple as that.  IF we dont receive the refund, THEN action should be taken.  In the meantime, play the game, have fun, and dont let this "issue" of dates and ordering and refunds give you an ulcer over it.  Of course, I will no doubt be accused of receving a check from Verant for saying this, even though i in no way approved of the way they handled this, like the other poor player who spoke out about this.  Oh well, people just like to stir up trouble i suppose.<P>Korce Spiritbear<BR>45th shaman<BR>Blood Tide, Solusek Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Obviously Verant and Microsoft went to the same Customer Service school!  One thing is for sure all this rhetoric isn't going to change anything.  Verant and The Station have one goal...get your money from you!!

</FONT><HR>Hail,<BR>The part that is most upsetting, is they are going to refund the shipping if it does not come by the 24th???? myself and my roomate both paided for OVERNIGHT!!!!!!! that does not mean, 2 dam weeks.  If i wanted to wait and pray i got it by the 24th then i would have paid the dam ground shipping.  So, IMO.... i could careless about a refund IF it comes.  Verant broke an agreement with me, about the shipping.  Overnight does not equal 2 weeks.  period.<P>Arcangell Dethbird<BR>50 Enchanter<BR>(over 100 days played)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>quote from Gordon..."We are committed to doing right by our cusotmers in this matter...."<P>Well Gordon, if you are so committed to doing right by the customer then why is it that you are only going to offer a refund to those that ordered the CD before the 19th and did not get it on the 24th.  I ordered the upgrade on the 11th with over night delivery and never got a email confirmation until AFTER I called Zomax on the 19th and spoke with a rep who after 10 minutes "found" my order and said, "Oh, its being shipped tomorrow and you'll have it no later then the 21st"  EXCUSE ME!!!  The 21st is a Holiday and UPS does not ship.  Even if I were to by some miricle get my upgrade by the 24th you should "AT THE VERY LEAST" refund the over-night shipping charges.<P>Secondly, since when does a customer orientated business charge its customer's for a product SIX DAYS BEFORE the product was supposedly shipped??  This does not even sound LEGAL!!!!  I ordered the CD on the 11th and my credit card was charged on the 13th and I have YET to receive the disc (with so called over night express).<P>So Gordon I have a question for you if you and Verant/Sony/Whoever wants to step up to bat and answer it....<P>What are you going to do for ALL of us who had to put up with this HUGE screwup???  Do I hear refund of the shipping fee for ALL those that did not receive the CD when they should have???  Do I hear a free month for us putting up with the hassle and the toll-free numbers that give us the run around??  Do I hear postponing the launch till we all get our discs???<P>I am betting that we "valued customers" will never see any of this since Verant/Sony thinks of us all as nothing more then mindless slaves who like throwing away $10 each month.  Hell, without us they would have NO EverQuest.....Maybe they should think about that and then come back with a DECENT offer for this headache.<P>Signed...<BR>A very upset mage who wishes he could sick his pet onto Verant/Sony...<P>Zaymot Silver of Fennin Ro<BR>a.k.a Ray Barber<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Here is the email from Abashi. It's also posted on another thread in this board:<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>Upon further investigation and contact with JC-Smith on the subject, I was able to obtain the name of the GM that made the comments. It does appear now that the comments were in-fact made and I'd like to extend my apology to JC-Smith and EQLizer for my abrupt comments on the matter. It is apparent that JC-Smith's first email inquiries on the matter were overlooked among the many others we've received in regards to shipping. I've provided JC-Smith with my email address to increase our ability to respond to issues such as this in the future before they grow to these proportions.<BR> <BR>I would like to stress that the GM involved is new to our company and is still becoming familiar with the way we operate our business. He evidently misunderstood the situation and his comments on it were mistaken. The problems associated with shipping the product late last week definitely were not planned, nor do we consider them acceptable as attested to by our CEO John Smedley in his several posts on the subject. <P>As mentioned by John, we continue to apologize for the problems associated with shipping the expansion upgrade pack, and are committed correcting the situation in the eyes of our customers. <P>-Gordon<BR>&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033510-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/033510.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=033510&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=033510&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
