</FONT><HR>Overall, very disppointing.  Feels like they rushed it for the holiday season. Too many quests are unfinished, many NPCs were there but served no purpose (Bloodmaw and bloodied gnome, broodmother, etc).<P>Iceclad:<BR>  Hunting here is patchy, mostly a run thru zone.  Portal is too dangerous and without SOW or invis I prefer boating.  This zone is huge and there is almost nothing useful here.<P>Eastern Wastes:<BR>  Camper's heaven. If anything drops an items 5 groups are /shouting over who gets next kill or who was there first. Ugly place, I hunted roamers that drop nothing with moderate xp.<P>Crystal Caverns:<BR>  Decent zone, needs a way to impove faction with dwarves.  I suspect there are quests there but were not finished so everyone was made dubious with no adjustment until they finish...just my theory.<P>Great Divide:<BR>  Hunting roamers is fun.  Pathing in caves is awful, things pop out of nowhere, ago from a room that is a long tunnel away, so pulling one is a crap shoot, as others may or may not pop right on top of you.  Guardian wurms are overcamped and so far 1 spell dropped in 4 days of playing.  You can keep your spells I don't want to waste days here doing same tedious things.  Whoever thought that spells should be rare drops is a retard plain and simple and I will say it to their face if I ever meet them. (I'm not upset that I can't get any velious or 50+ kunark spells and my research is 180+ and not being used after 49).<P>Thurgadin:<BR>  Nice city, almost complete with lots of useless quests that are impossible to finish  Gems are a very rare drop from 55-60 MOBs, torn/tainted/etc compenents drop deep in Kael and requre sevearl full groups, rare drops.  Shawl quest started well but is unfinished.  Another holiday release sign.<P>Kael:<BR>  Other than a zone for Rallos Zek followers this place sucks.  Tons of greens on the path to WL, but one wrong turn and 55+ reds that see invis.<P>Wakening Lands:<BR>  Woushi...no much needs to be said.  I have dubious with dragons and died twice zoning in because of faction loading problem.  No more ports here for me.  Green go are agro and hit harder than most blues.  Holgresh caves are horribly pathed, they pop under the world, above the caves and in the walls,while still casting on you.  Another useless zone, poorly designed.<P>Skyshrine:<BR>  Too tough to raise faction even with giant toes.  Like Kael it feels unfinished.  I expected the dragons to have some nice quests, but they are no different than Kael or Thurgadin...what's the use.<P>Plane Of Growth:<BR>  A zone with nice drops if you hunt here and enough faction screwing to never go to any druid/ranger based town again.  Indifferent about this zone.<P>Siren's Grotton:<BR>  No thank you, I got this far and all I saw were people outside who needed help getting their corpses and people zoning out because they could not loot their corpses and cleric hoping to get in to rez.  Total waste of a zone.<P>Western Wastes:<BR>  Never go this far<P><BR>Overall: I give Velious 3/10...<P>The fun factor is non existant. After a frustrating two weeks, the novelty factor went away and I returned to Kunark.  Some day people at Verant will actually play in these zones and build them correctly.  At this point the zones that are good are that way due to sheer luck because there are twice as many zones that are horrible and almost never have people in them. Oh and one more thing, the faction system sucks!<P>Thank you.<P>PS. Adding this to a long list of ignored posts...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Vellious,<P>All in all, very beautiful, very well done zones, lots of neat new concepts.  For the most part I like it.  I really like the way faction was done.  The zones are gorgeous, mobs look great, equipment is really cool, good spells.<P>Problems:<BR>1) it tripled the general lag in the entire game.  And the zones are notorious for dumping people.  <P>2) Mobs have 3 times the hps and hit 10 levels higher than they did before.  That really isn't a big deal, you can cope with that.  The big problem is you removed casters from the equation in vellious.  Almost everything is completely MR.  Yeah sure, lures still stick, and of course heals work, but the rest of us are sol on casting on 1/2 the stuff (dorfs in thurg, kobolds, giants in kael, the list goes on and on)  and its even a lot of mobs that are level 30 and such.  Its easier to cast on Cazic Thule himself than a lot of the mobs in vellious.  That was a serious design flaw. I can understand some of the higher level encounters being more magic resistant, but level 30 mobs?<P>4) Lag, lag, and more lag, please read the myriad of posts about mass LDs in the QA/Bugs boards.<P>5) Lot of general bugs with mobs dissappearing, tracking into walls and getting stuck under the world and killing you (siren's, holgresh cave).<P>6) Balance.  You claimed when vellious opened that the stats on the quest armors was essentially the same across all 3 races (dorfs, giants, dragons) so there would be no advantage to choosing one race over another.  Well there is a huge advantage to being on dorf faction.  The armor drops in Kael.  If you are on giant or dragon faction it drops from Veeshans temple (the hardest zone in the game).  Just to get there you have to go through 2 other zones that rank in the top 5 for hardest zones in the game.  That is insanely unbalanced.  That means that only the most elite can take advantage of being on dragon or giant faction.  Giant armor should drop in skyshrine or thurgadin and dragon quest armor should be the exact same as dwarf if you want to claim balance.  Otherwise you should have said, if you are a casual gamer who wants to do the quests you should be on dwarf faction.  <P>7) There is no way to get faction with the temple of rallos zek so those on giant faction cannot wander the entire town no matter what they do.<P>8) Lag lag and lag<P>9) Constantly changing drop rates (PoG, coldain missionary books effectively removed (about 0.3% from 5%), quest armor drops).  <P>10) Zones are way to large, adds to lag.  Throw in all the trees in Wakening Lands and it is almost un-navigable even with clipping plane turned all the way down and a fast computer.  Trees are a real problem.  Please do not have heavily forested areas in any new zones, it makes them a royal pain and keeps people out (swamp of no-frames, Burning woods, Wakening Lands)<P>11)  Lag Lag and server dumps<P><BR>Malase</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I’ve come to see Velious as kind of an uber-guild playground.  If I was a high-time-commitment player who could easily assemble multi-group fighting forces, Velious would be great: lots of uber-mobs to take down and two new planes.  And I’m genuinely happy for people who meet that description.<P>I, however, am a fairly casual player who plays for 2-3 hours at a time and often relies on pickup groups.  Within those constraints, there seems to be very little to do in Velious, at least in the low 50’s.  Everytime I find myself over there, I run around for a while searching in vain for a group, then wind up looking for a teleport back to Karnor’s (ugh).<P>The Thurgadin armor quests have been disappointing.  When I first heard the concept, I thought, great, finally there is a way to get top-end armor for people who can’t make the 8+ hour time commitments needed for plane raids.  Well, not quite.  The alternative to participating in repeated multi-group, multi-hour plane raids is … engaging in repeated multi-hour, multi-group raids on high-level mobs in Kael Drakkel.  If I had the time to do Kael raids (killing the mobs dropping corroded armor), I could just do plane raids and get the stuff more directly.<P>I wasn’t expecting a fast or easy way to get planes-type armor; these quests should take substantial time to complete.  I was just hoping for a way to get it that is feasible for a casual player (i.e., step by step over a period of time).<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First let me start with the good. Overall I like all the zones. Mobs, Terrain, Climate (weather). I love exploring and Velious makes it a very nice challenge and very interesting for me as an enchanter. The new creatures are great and makes it worthwhile over all to group. <BR>Now the bad. Let me start with Waking Lands. Holgresh Cave is a major bug. If you engage a mob and move from the room into the tunnel the Holgresh tend to "disappear" under the world and unable to kill unless it is hitting a caster. If hitting a caster the caster can target and nuke it. Wuoshi needs to have agro radious reduced or he needs to be moved from the portal. I understand the risks that are supposed to be when zoning into a zone via a portal. But how are you suppose to port into this zone without a dragon tooth that you can't get anyway? Maybe completely get rid of the portal? <P>Snow Dervishes at the Iceclad portal need to be moved out a bit further. They attack you before you fully zone into the zone thus allowing them to possibly kill you.<P>Many mobs in Velious are seriously under /con. Mobs hit way too darn hard for the level that they /con. If this was the intention then rewards need to be increased for general population. This also wroks into the problem with mesmerize line of spells for enchanters. On raids to planes and higher level zones it puts enchanters out of their roll as being only able to buff in many situations as many mobs have very very high Magic Resistance or completely magic resistant.<P>City of Thurgadin: Only one Water and food vendor? For all them Dwarfs? I think this needs to be reconsidered as well. <P>This goes for many of the zones throughout new and old Norrath. Mobs agroing and attacking through walls and ceilings needs to be fixed.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Overall, I would say the expansion is very nice graphically, and introduces some very good new ideas. I think perhaps the main fault is that instead of expirementing with new -alternative- approaches to making areas difficult, the new ideas are too often stacked on top of the existing crutches of more hp, unreasonable resists, and underconning.<BR> <BR>Iceclad<BR>-------<BR>Like it. Druid ring isn't too safe, but I find that a positive feature. <P>Tower of Frozen Shadow<BR>----------------------<BR>Like it. Haven't killed the top mob, but I've heard shes way tougher than anything else in there...We had one group crawl through basically the whole thing, and we had some notion we might fight the boss as well, but did not end up doing so. If it turned out the boss needed a big raid to beat, when one group had no trouble  with the rest of it, that might not be appropriate. But what I've actually seen of  it was very nice. Love the torches.<P>Eastern Wastes<BR>-------------<BR>Like it. Several fine camp spots, at least one (orc camp) bringing out the worst in people. Always good to have a stress test to expose any ***holes you might have thought were decent people  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> Some very nice quests involving this area as well.<P>Crystal Caverns<BR>---------------<BR>Love it. Although it was pretty much all green, the layout and look of it was excellent, and as far as I could tell nothing was absurdly hard for its level. Now, I don't know the levels for sure, and if it was all level 15-20 greens and not 30s greens, that would be a different matter. The orc section is very scenic as well.<P>Great Divide<BR>------------<BR>Not bad.<BR>One thing: the guardian wurm drop rate. In the first few days when spells were dropping at a reasonable rate, I thought this was a great idea...somewhere you had to camp to get your bottom level dropped spells, everyone had to go through it, but you got your spells fast  and moved on. This was nice. If you wanted to stop the farming, make the scrolls nodrop, enforcing the 'camp your spells fast and move on' effect. Axing the drop rate was not a better solution. <P>Velkator's <BR>----------<BR>There is a lot of merrit in the idea of making a dungeon difficult by having slipery ground, and bizarre falling-levitation effects moving you about in odd ways. However, the first attempt at this probably should not have been combined with abnormally difficult residents. If the creatures here had been of say lower guk or karnor's toughness level throughout, this probably would have been an excellent dungeon. Also, this is the first area (on my list anyway) that we encounter creatures that both have a ton of hit points for something their level, and far too much MR. Some encounters through Kunark had to have abnormal MR to avoid being annihilated too quickly, sure. But when you have something with well over 32k hp, I can see just about no reason it needs to have extreme MR. Unmezzable flag...sure, enchanters can still contribute directly. In fact, extreme resistance wasn't  even a good solution in Kunark. The desired effect was to require more people to succeed in a raid, but the implementation did so by making X% of the avaliable classes contribute minimally,which was not very nice. With the potential for extreme HP totals on the new creatures, there is no reason to retain that class-unbalancing crutch of unreasonable resistances.<P>Thurgadim<BR>---------<BR>I have not yet betrayed the dwarves trust, so I can't really comment on this as a dungeon. As a town I find it perfectly reasonable. The scene with the tolerance-preaching dwarf in the tavern is excellent. The special method for addressing the Dain is amusing as well.<P>Kael<BR>----<BR>The giants have too many hp, but then giants always have, so no big deal. I tend to think, that if you don't want a quest mob to be killed, making it a green that fights like a 65 isn't really a good answer. If you must do this, you really should make it nonaggresive and non-assisting as well. Other than that, I like it so far.<P>Wakening<BR>--------<BR>With dragon up, zone is half. Not because the dragon is half the zone, just because that seems to be his aggro radius. Annoying, but not terminal for the zone quality. Most of the creatues here I like. Unfortunately, some are in the vague general area sort of near  the dragon, which means for the most part, players aren't going anywhere near them ever.  Which is a shame, because the creatues are all interesting (the armour and geonids in particular ... making up for the 'clone of emerald jungle' textures from a graphical standpoint) but at least the half that does get used is good. I do like that the zone portal is guarded, although it does mean you really need to make sure the 'base faction on zone-in' bug is fixed.<P>PoG<BR>---<BR>Haven't been there, they tell me its nice. <P>Skyshrine<BR>---------<BR>Like it. Haven't fought cubes and beyond though. The random quest thing is interesting, although if dragging my enemies corpses offended me, you'ld think someone standing around begging passerbys to kill me so they could get a different quest might also bring out my aggresive side.<P>Cobalt Scar<BR>-----------<BR>Acceptable, if dangerous to hunt in. The drakes may be excessive.<P>Siren's Grotto (going by heresay)<BR>--------------<BR>Fighting clerics = fun. Fighting enchanters = fun. Fighting gating mobs = fun, if stressfull. Fighting multiples of those three = fun. Fighting multiple unstunnable gating clerics and enchanters who easilly charm even targets with maxxed MR and gate = not fun. In fact any uninterruptable gating mob likely to be encountered away from its spawn point at all is pretty much wrong. Unsplittable multiple pulls = fun. Unsplittable unmezzable multiple pulls = fun and challenging Unsplittable unmezzable multiple pulls that path onto you from nowhere without warning = bugged. Getting attacked while zonning in by fear-class mobs = stressfull, but doable. Getting attacked while zonning in by unstunnable gating enchanters who can auto-charm you = just wrong. If and when we discover tactics that allow us to fight here with skill and luck, as opposed to simply bringing more numbers than the engine will support being in one place at one time, you can go ahead and tell us we were wrong. Untill then, this zone needs to be rethought. <P>Western Wastes/ToV/Sleeper's<BR>----------------------------<BR>Haven't been, haven't heard, don't know.<BR>Suspect when I do I'll be able to reiterate my previous point:<BR>1. With a 32k hp cap extreme resistance may have been a necessary evil.<BR>2. With a hp cap much, much higher than that, all retaining these extreme resistances<BR>does is make multiple classes nigh-obsolete, which is in no way a good solution. Make things unmezzable if needed, unstunnable altogether if necessary (but do NOT let them gate and summon if they are roamers in that case) and, if absolutely necessary (and you've thought it over at least twice) make them insanely MR if you can't stand the thought of them being fought slowed or snared, but at least leave one elemental and preferably poison/disease resists at low levels. A wizard should be able to land at least one lure at near 100% on just about any creature in the game, and preferably a normal nuke well over 50%. A necro should be able to tap something within about 5 levels of them. An SK should be able to land 100% HT on anything short of a god :P (And I mean thematically, lord Doljonintollerablename is 'short of  a god' by this measure...as is, basically, anything that doesn't have a server named after it) <P>Ksetrel said:<BR>"Nothing new there, of course. Kunark was a good start to hindering enjoyment.  "Oh sorry, YOU have to bind in Overthere, and YOU have to bind in Firiona Vie...  what, you wanted to adventure together? LOL, Hard Cheese, schmuck, but thanks  for the cash... Oh, and you'll be happy to know that you can't fight in several  of the dungeons your friends do because of faction booby traps we inserted in  the game, isn't that a hoot? *We* thought so, and we are gaming gods..." " <P>This really bears repeating, as its a counter viewpoint VI really needs to recognize. Many players seem to think linking outpost and dungeon factions was just wrong. Not clever, not a necessary evil required by your overall storyline that noone really knows, but simply wrong. If an idea you had, no matter how keen it sounded in the staff meeting, is interpreted by any significant percentage of your players as you saying "LOL, Hard Cheese, schmuck" then it has failed in practice, and should be immediately reexamined. <P>Now, if by 'going back and revamping old world zones' according to some of the new ideas in Velious means that various mobs in Karnor's will someday offer quests for equivalents to ALL the evil-race usable equipment that drops there and in Charsis then this is a mighty good thing. Or, for that matter, that they'll put equivalent items on reasonable-difficulty (doesn't even need to be as easy, just sub merchant-trainer-uberguard level) in Cabilis. Why do I suspect that this isn't the case?  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>*********************************************<BR>Everytime I find myself over there, I run around for a while searching in vain for a group, then wind up looking for a teleport back to Karnor’s (ugh).<P>The Thurgadin armor quests have been disappointing. When I first heard the concept, I thought, great, finally there is a way to get top-end armor for people who can’t make the 8+ hour time commitments needed for plane raids. Well, not quite. The alternative to participating in repeated multi-group, multi-hour plane raids is … engaging in repeated multi-hour, multi-group raids on high-level mobs in Kael Drakkel. If I had the time to do Kael raids (killing the mobs dropping corroded armor), I could just do plane raids and get the stuff more directly.<P>I wasn’t expecting a fast or easy way to get planes-type armor; these quests should take substantial time to complete. I was just hoping for a way to get it that is feasible for a casual player (i.e., step by step over a period of time).<P>**************************************************<P>/AGREEE VERY STRONGLY WITH THIS STATEMENT<P>EQ has become KarnorsQuest for pick up groups and if you get lucky you go to the hole or sebilis</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I would be much happier if there were a bind point somewhere where people actually spend time.<P>It is very disheartening to beg for 20 minutes to get a gate to iceclad, run for another 15 across two zones to get to Thurgadin, only to find it completely uninhabited and have to 1) beg a guildie to break from their hunting to run there and bind me, 2) camp and hope someone's there when I return or 3) run back to the boat and make the long trip back to Kunark, seething mad.

</FONT><HR>Far too often in Vellious, particularly in Wakening Lands and Cobalt Scars, mobs that are low in life and attempt to flee get stuck in a pathing bug.  What happens then is that unable to become "un-stuck" they instead port back to their home location, often causing trains.<P>This is NOT an example of mobs casting the gate spell.  It happens with non-casting mobs and there is no "xxx begins to cast the gate spell" message.  It also does NOT happen if the mob is snared and thus unable to flee, nor does it happen (usualy) if you are w/in melee range.  It primarily affects people that are kiting and using range affects to take down the mob.  Note that this includes TEAM kiting as well as solo kiting.<P>Mobs I've seen this happen the most often with are: Giants in Wakening lands.  Sentient armor in Wakening lands.  Raptors of all shapes in Wakening Lands.  Wyverns in Cobalt Scars.  Ulthorks in Cobalt Scars.<P>One other problem in Wakening Lands:<BR>At lvl 42 Tar goo is blue and cons about right.  However, when you kill it, two "baby" tar goos spawn.  Each "baby" is green at 42 but seems to have about double the hp of their daddy and hits for about twice as hard.  Additionaly, they seem to have higher resistances.  In a nutshell, the babies are MUCH tougher to kill but yield no xp for the effort.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Iceclad:<BR>Lots of wasted space.  Once you step off the islands there is NOTHING to do in this zone.  Would have been a great spot for that underwater city everyone always wanted in OOT.  Not even any easter eggs like in Tim Deep.  Good zone otherwise, just wish more of it was useful instead of filler.<P>Tower of Frozen Shadow:<BR>Oh my god I love this place.  Level 4 is a deathtrap though, the shadows are too hard.  Level 5 is a pushover except for the enraged relative and unless you are camping the rings you usually just kill til you get that no-rent key and pass on through.  Again great dungeon, just please make it to where the keys work like the dragon teeth (once you get the next one in sequence you don't need the earlier ones) I miss that half of my handmade backpack and would like 4 inventory slots back =)<P>East Wastes:<BR>Good zone, no complaints.<P>Crystal Caverns:<BR>Yummy goodness.  Two thumbs up.<P>Great Divide:<BR>Again, good zone, no complaints.<P>Thurgadin:<BR>God of Cities, hands down.<P>Icewell:<BR>Too many mobs too close together in the dwarven keep.  Never been down below to hunt personally.<P>Kael Drakkal:<BR>So-So city.  Needs vendors a'la Thurgadin.  Not much to do here and half of the quests you'd want to do in the city can be done by slaughtering the quest giver and prying that prize from their cold hands.  <P>Wakening Lands:<BR>Wuoshi Bad.  Panthers are annoying.  Nice Quests.  Flying Monkeys go below the world if you try to pull them outside of their cave.  Having to zone because the monkey is below the world and still trying to kill you is NOT FUN.  Sentient Armor was nice but someone else said it was nerfed, and come to think of it I haven't seen anybody hunting any lately.<P>Plane of Growth:<BR>One way zones are annoying, I had to gate all the way back to Emerald Jungle the first time I came here.<P>Skyshrine:<BR>Find whoever designed Thurgadin and let them loose on this "city".  Note the quotes... this is BARELY passable as a city.  Only thing that makes it a city is people can bind and oh yeah there is a bank in here.  This zone is VERY dissappointing if you want to keep your faction in here.  The five vendors in the secret room sell USELESS spells (except for the ports which are a recent addition)  I recommend jewelcraft vendors (gems are used for a lot of spell components) and someone to sell tiny daggers in that room instead as well as maybe some alchemy vendors too.  The bar downstairs doesn't even have a bartender that you can buy beer from.  My recommendation is take that area in the basement and instead of putting mobs down there that nobody will kill anyway, put the merchants down there and some trade areas.  There is as much if not more room than the hall of trade goodness in thurgadin (aka the bank area) and there is more room in the room with the banker, and the small room beside him.<P>Cobalt Scar:<BR>Where is the sky?  Great zone otherwise =)<P>Sirens Grotto:<BR>I'm afraid to even zone in here from the horror stories I've heard, so Cobalt Scar is as far as I've gotten.  Please make this zone someplace that might be possible to 1) zone in without dying and 2) hunt in.  Sounds like a cool place.<P>Faction (the key to the zones):<BR>You guys went way overboard in the nerfing of faction, either that or whoever designed the skyshrine quests had no clue.  Lets take one quest for example: Sentry Emil's report.<BR>* Time to do the quest once: 5-10 mins depending on zone time (you have to zone) and if you have jboots / sow<BR>* Okay so whats the problem?: Time running quest: 8 hours, yep you heard me right.  <BR>* Starting faction with Tunarian Court: Dubious<BR>  Ending Faction with Tunarian Court: Kindly (the best faction you can have)<BR>* Starting faction with dragons: Threateningly (have to use faction up spell to talk to them) <BR>  Ending faction with dragons: Threateningly<P>Yep thats right no change over 8 hours of running this quest.  I did this quest so many times I got two blue bubbles of xp, but I am STILL at the same faction level with the dragons as I was before.  Something is seriously wrong here.<P>Overall thoughts:<BR>I love the npc interaction, and the quests given by strange creatures (gnolls, othmir, etc), but the three main factions are not equal.  <BR>* Dwarves have the city from the gods and good quests (shawl and ring are examples of GOOD quests and the way more quests SHOULD be)<BR>* Giants have good quests, but drop armor for Dwarf quests and also drop most of the quest rewards for the quests that they give.  City needs to be more in line with thurgadin as far as trades and vendors.<BR>* Dragons have.. um.. well I can buy wizard portals for my wizard friends.  City needs to be more in line with thurgadin as far as trades and vendors.  Quests need to be existant, also having to ask the zone to kill someone to get him to spawn with a different quest is .. sadistic.  Thank you for at least allowing all versions of the same named npc to accept the items for all the quests even if they aren't currently giving that one.<P>Well those are my thoughts.. out of it all I primarily wish that the cities were more equal.  The ONLY reason I am still allied with the dwarves instead of the dragons and giants (IE I'd be actively killing the dwarves for dragon / giant faction) is that they are the only source in the entire game for velium bars.<P>=- Remelio Gemweaver - Lvl 53 High Elf Illusionist - Tarew Marr -=</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First thing I would like to say is that most of the Velious zones are gorgeous. There was a lot of attention to detail in places like Thurgadin and Kael. The NPCs that talk amongst themselves, the quests, alot of little things that show polish. <P>Now for the bad. <P>Gameplay.<P>This expansion seems to have been designed for 2 groups of players: the level 55+ multiple group type, and the level 35-45 single group xp type. Why is there nowhere that a level 50-55 group can fight as a *single* group for xp? <P>This brings me to the next point. Green mobs that are insanely difficult for their level. I am of the opinion that if a character stands a significant chance of dying during an encounter, that character should recieve experience for successfully defeating that encounter. <P>As an example, I was with my usual group exploring skyshrine. We had been there for about an hour, slowly working our way in. All of the mobs we had fought had been green for everyone in the group, except for the 42 warrior. Most of the mobs were blue. These encounters were roughly as difficult as fighting blue, ~level 45 Drolvargs in Karnors. We end up fighting a mob that is green to the 42 warrior, but is hitting for about 135 damage a pop. The fact that it was at least 10 levels green, and that I had almost 1000 AC and full shaman and cleric buffs did nothing to help me tank this MOB. It hit at or near full damage every swing. Why would a group that can handle multiple white MOBs in a dungeon setting (constructs in Karnors) almost get owned by a single green mob in Velious?<P>Faction.<BR>There should be compelling reasons to ally with any of the 3 factions in Velious, but currently the benefits of allying with one faction over another are immense. The giants give out much better quest items than the coldain do. The city of Kael Drakkel is also an important highway to later Velious zones. If you had to choose simply a faction between coldain and giants simply on needing to get through Kael Drakkel and not being a class that can self invis, the choice is obvious. <P>Having good coldain faction gives easier access to Icewell Keep. Having good giant faction enables easier access to Wakening Lands, PoG, Skyshrine, Cobalt Scar, Siren's Grotto, Western Wastes, Temple of Veeshan and Dragon Necropolis. That's 1 zone versus 8 zones.<P>In the rest of the game, there are alternate ways to get just about anywhere. In velious, there is only one way to go anywhere. There is no "underground" for KOS people to pass through a city. There is no way to go around. Classes that can't self invis, can't port, and are KOS to the giants are completely dependant on the good graces of someone else to go past Kael Drakkel. If they do go past this point and hunt in zones beyond, there is no way at all for them to get out. NONE. They are completely reliant on someone else. <P>I was talked into going to skyshrine one time to fight, went LD while fighting and couldn't get back on. For the next 3 days, I would periodically log in and see if I could get a port out or an invis through Kael. It took 3 days, during which I could not go anywhere. I have never been so frustrated with a game in my life.<P>Give us places for a single 50+ group to fight and get experience. <P>Give us alternate methods of travel that allow us some freedom in choosing which faction we ally with. <P>Bring the rewards for choosing one faction over another closer to parity. <P>Get rid of green mobs that can take down a whole group.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I spent most of 30 to 39 in Velious, so my comments only reflect zones that fit those levels.<P>Iceclad: Fine zone, decent introduction to the continent. Nothing special, BUT: Please please please synch up the timing of the raft and the boat. For that matter, add another raft. I understand the concept of having a big ocean and requiring a long boat ride to make it seem like the zone is far away. But for heaven's sake, it's really common for me to wait 10 or 15 minutes for the raft to show in North Ro, then another 10 or 15 minutes (or even 20 plus minutes) for the Icebreaker to show at the the docks, and the exact same thing going back. For heaven's sake, the boat ride is long enough, why do I need to burn 30 minutes to an hour of just WAITING for the boats to even show when making a round trip?<P>Tower of Frozen Shadow: Great ideas, and fun, in the parts I've seen. It's way too hard to get keys, though, and so it's seriously underused.<P>Eastern Wastes: Fun, seems to be well balanced, no complaints (although it's mentally disturbing to kill snow bunnies in order to get other stuff to spawn).<P>Crystal Caverns: Woo hoo, what a fun dungeon! This place is great! No complaints, other that being tired of level 50+ folks camping it.<P>Great Divide: Fun layout, and a real hoot to walk around dragons all the time. No complaints or suggestions.<P>Thurgadin: Decent city, and yes, I too love the character interaction and folks moving around, living their lives. Great work! My only real complaint is a severe lack of muffins (who doesn't love muffins?) and shurikens that cost less than 2 GOLD each.<P>Overall, what a blast. And if you ignore everything else, please, for heaven's sake, fix the damned boat timing. It really drains a lot of the fun out.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>----------------------<BR>Skyshrine:<P>Great zone in my opinion. Has really good loot if you're going to raid it, and it has both mid level to high level difficulty<P>It caters to the soloer, to the invidual groups, as well as to the guild raids depending on where you go.<P>Loot is great...might even be too good for the level you can attain it..but most of it is NO DROP which may help to offset it.<P>Not too much to say really...I like it for the most part. (although why do some of those green mobs summon.../shrug).<BR>------------------------<P>Tower of Frozen Shadows:<P>Great zone. Gets harder the higher you go, nicely designed...great concept, very nice loot, cool NPCs.<P>Problem:  It's designed for one group at a time...or one raid at a time. If there are two sets of people in the dungeon...you end up competing for a key to get to the next level unless the other guys already have the key.<P>It's also VERY annoying to have to carry around 7 keys if you want access to all the levels. Inventory space is a premium. However this may be as intended. <P>----------------------<BR>Velketor's Labyrinth:<P>The biggest problem with this dungeon is that the loot is SUB-PAR for individual 50+ groups (and too many green mobs for 50+ groups).<P>It's also so difficult that generally the only people willing to go here are 50+ groups...so it is a turn off to be fighting green mobs.<P>For a guild raid this zone is awesome. Very cool layout...plus you get to find out who the ones that keep stepping on the traps are heheh. <BR>Awesome loot from the tough mobs in the dungeon..again that's for a guild raid.<P>Conclusion: This zone is empty unless there's a guildraid. For an individual group it's fun to look around...but like I said, to a 50+ group, the loot here from the mobs doable by a single group is sub-par (on average...I think there are two or three nice pieces that I've heard of from friends...havent seen them myself yet.<P>----------------------------<BR>Siren's Grotto<P>Horrible horrible pathing and agro problems. Mobs in the zone in sometimes agro on you when you're going through one of the tubes below the zone-in for example.  And guess what happens when they run to you....yeah they tell their buddies!!<BR>Instant death sometimes for no apparent reason. This zone might be a good xp place if the loot was good (why would one bother to go to a no loot place for xp when you can go to sebilis and get xp and awesome loot).<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Me and my friends (51+) have decided that Velious mobs are way too hard for their level.  If we want experance we go to Kunark.  Velious loot is not that much better than Kunark.  So for loot we go to Kunark.<P>The question we keep asking ourselves is why did we buy the Velious expansion.<P>Wakening lands: Woushi being at the port in site.  Sorry, we will NOT be wasting our time killing 200+ mostly non-exp giants just to use the port.<P>Shame on you VI for putting the wizard port spells in Skyshrine.  <P>Velious = lvl 60, uber guild, "i'm board" play ground. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well I was pretty disappointed in Velious.  I guess sitting in Kael killing green giants for faction doesnt appeal to me.  Oh yes, I could go deeper with 2 or 3 groups and get no faction, sub-par loot, and no exp.  Nah, I wouldnt do that either.<P>Anyway I went a couple of times.. you can have it, I'll stick to Seb, Charasis, and Chardok.<P>/em shakes head wondering how she got suckered into buying velious<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, this zone is just one of those that really appeals to me. I'm not sure why... maybe it's the invis spiders or something. However, just a few days ago I set foot in it and probably won't be returning for a long, long time.<BR>We had a full group of level 40ish folk and almost everything on tracking con'd blue (all of the mobs near the zone).<P>The typical pull wasn't too extreme as 2, maybe 3 mobs would come and attempt to smack us down. However, the difficulty of the mobs compared to the rewards given was HORRENDOUS.<P>For a Typical encounter of this level, the mobs were too tough and the xp given was a complete farce, hence the reason I will never go back. Did our group handle them fine? Yeah, for the most part. But each fight took 2 times as long as normal fights that could be found in, say, Great Divide for our level and the xp given was probably half. We spent several hours in here with no deaths and my experience bar hardly moved.<P>The treasure found on these was non existant. Yes, I realize they are the mobs on the very bottom floor, but given the difficulty and sheer amount of HPs these things had, we thought at least SOMETHING useful would drop.<P>As for fun, I think I covered that when I said I wouldn't return anytime soon. Will I probably go back? Maybe in 10 levels but only with a purpose in mind (ie Velk raid). I wanted to go here as just a general fun and intriguing place to hunt, but it wasn't even close to filling my expectations.<P>"The zone would be fun if it wasn't for...." the difficulty of the mobs and the loot/experience they give back for the hard work done to kill them.<P>Suggestions? Just go back and look at what the idea for the zone was. I would suggest sending in a group of level 38ish players and have them fight at the zone. You will realize that there honestly is no reason for them to stay there. For one, they could get more xp one zone-wall away, and two, they would get various loot to increase their bank balances.<P>I just have to say though, I love Velious thus far. I had a 51 ranger but quit a week after Kunark came out. I haven't left Velious for over 10 levels now and really feel like I'm at home in these new zones. Exploring Kunark is fun too, but Velious just does it for me =) But PLEASE look at the faction issues......<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>First off, about me:  Lvl 57 Rogue, in one of the larger/more-uber guilds on our server.<P>The mobs in SoV are underconned nearly flat out across the board.  <P>a) Also, Risk/Reward is sorely out of whack in general.  <P>In the old world, you generally had 3 "classes" of mobs in any given lvl range - <BR>1) Poor, but best exp (based on mob hp/resists/dmg, and zone modifier) - e.g. Specters (sp)<BR>2) Very rich, but poor exp. (based on the same factors) - e.g. Hill Giants.<BR>3) Balance between the two - e.g. SolA.<P>In Kunark mobs were more underconned than the old world, but gave higher Exp.  Of course, most of the mobs have very poor loot (cash, FS, etc.).  In SoV mobs are even more underconned, but balanced the other way, 50+% of the random trash drops a FS equivilent, and good plat; but very poor exp.<P>The questing (when not broken/unimplenmented) is good; at least the ones that don't require the mass slaughter of green crap for nodrop components.<P>b) Quests that span large lvl ranges just never work out.  It seems like they are designed such that a player will get the first part early in his career (see pre 12 for original soulfire quest, and for mid 30's hunting cougars and coming upon Stormfeather), and then have bank space taken up by the pieces untill some later date (45+ for killing Lucan, lvl 50+ for killing the turtle).  Reguardless of how it is planned, what ends up happening is folks wait untill they are sufficient lvl to do the whole quest, then do it.  Folks screamed about the Soulfire quest, and you gave them an entrance to the quest for higher lvl folks.  Waiting gives them appropriate risk/reward for the harder end of the scale, but reduces the rest of the quest to camping green crap.<P>c) Quests requiring trade skills, but eather having nodrop result (of the Tradeskill use) or having the components of the item being nodrop.  Now I realize that these quests were intended to give folks that had the skills a bone for following the (generally) time/cash sink skills.  However, with the results (and midquest bonuses) being as good as they are, alot of folks want to do them.  If I could, I'd be happy to supply pelts to a tailor to make a blanket, likewise the parts for a knife to a blacksmith. (same with cooking/brewing  components for the prayer shawl quests).  This gives them some income and validates the hard work they did getting to where they are.  However, do to either the materials or the result being nodrop, insted I'm becoming a serviceable tailor and a master blacksmith (and my necro is becoming a master baker and brewer).  While this sucks alot of cash/time out of the player economy in the short term, it harms it in the long term.  Later down the road if I need some smithed armor, rather than buying it off someone who truely loves the skill (again gaining them plat and validation for all the carpaltunnel, time wasted, plat wasted on working up the skill), I'll just make it myself since that is faster.  I may even try my hand at making some cash off it, untill the market is so flooded as to make it unprofitable (see Jewel Craft).<P>d) Keys, all the stupid keys.   Give us a combinign  box to make a "keyring".  Give us a quest dude on newtral faction to turn in individual keys to get a "keyring".  Give us something.  My keys should not take up the equivilant space in my tinkers bag as a suit of resist armor.<P>e) The General Butt-Uglyness of the SoV armor sets.  Obviously this wont be changed, and is completely subjective anyways.  All I have to say is THANK YOU for the "turn off SoV textures" switchs in the ini.  5 Days after I got my SoV disk, those were turned off, and I've not regretted it since.<P>f) All the negative things that have been said about Sirrans Getto are true, no need for me to rehash them.<P>g) The high lvl game will default to being non-kos with Giant faction, or being kos with all three of them.  Why you ask?  1) WW/DragonNec/SkyShrine/Random Dragons are superior places to hunt, or are fun, or have superior loots.  Some may hunt the giants also for quest armor.  Does this matter much? not to your player base, and probably not to you guys.  I feel sorry for all your guys that put time/effort into trying to give us "choices" for which faction to follow.<P>All in all, if I want exp (with the occasional named loot), I'll camp HS/Seb (what about chardok you say?  hehe you funny man.).  If  I'm part of a 24 man raiding party, I'll go do WW or Woushi or Turtle (thought 24 is way overkill) or CS SeaMonster.  Otherwise, the only time you'll find me in SoV is camping Green crap for quests. (day 6 of Stormfeather watch, and then I get to farm kodiacs for HQ pelts, wee.)<P>Ninen of Saryrn<BR>The War Council</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Velious Issues -<P>1. Sirens Cove sucks. I normally party with 3-4 groups of 53-59 folks (avg. 56). We tried to go through with 4+ groups and were totalled immediately. Tried again with the evacuate scam, lost 30%. Insanely difficult for no reward. Bad pathing. Critters out of wack with the supposed levels.<P>2. Waking Lands marginally ok. Interesting critters and things to do. However, after have 1/3 of my guild Woushi'ed we basically avoid this zone. I habitually abscond rather than run here. Would love to go hunt the corrupted critters but every time we tried the Woushi range just ate us.<P>3. Kael - Makes no sense at all. If we chose to give up giant faction, theres no way to hunt here. Drops of quest items are way too low. Reward = risk issue here. Ill take the risk and manage the faction but right now its not worth it.<P>4. Great Divide marginal. Not sufficient reasons to come here at any level. Just a transit zone as far as I can tell.<P>5. Icewall Keep. Has potential. Single largest problem is that theres no easy way to learn this zone. I have yet to find a group that will do Icewall by choice. <P>6. Vel. Lab. Has potential but the critters are over powered at the bottom. Single biggest issue is the critters that summon. We kept finding critters falling from the ramps, living, and summoning folks into a nest of 6-10 aggroed greens. Noone has yet lived through this.<P>Most of the rest of the zones follow the same pattern.<P>1. Critters overpowered.<BR>2. risk vrs reward outof whack<BR>3. bad pathing / construction <P>The most telling comment I can make to you is that we moved our entire guild out to Velious for the first 4 weeks. At the end of that time, by unanimous vote, we move as a whole back to Kunark and are doing (in order) Charasis, Chardok, Kaesora (for keys), COM (for the caster shield), KC, and Sebelis. Thats 42 folks at lvls 45+ (guild minimum).<P>Lanath T'Vyl<BR>Wiz 55<BR>Vallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Some Solutions<P>I'll try to list some simple problems and simple solutions here.<P>Problem: Faction, it is more tedious then fun<BR>Solution: If you want to retain the faction triangle in place, some major tweaking is going to need to be done. Take all giants not inside or near kael off of kael faction. This includes great divide, and most of easter wastes, possibly even wakening lands. Take most of wurms/dragons not in skyshrine/ToV off of that faction. Raise the amount of posotive dragon faction given by giant kills. Lower the amount of negative giant faction given by dragons and dwarfs. I will give you a specific situation to explain why.<P>I myself am a founding member of a very old guild, the oldest on our server and probably one of the oldest in EQ. I am a druid, I always have been. I do not solo, I am a grouping druid. I like to do things with my guildmates. We are not a huge guild, we are a nicely sized guild who's sole charter is to have fun and be a family. We are part of a large alliance on our server in which we have the oppertunity to participate in "uber" type raids constantly. However I like to plan the spontaneous raid and get everyone together to do something. As this week we got a good group toghether and deafeted the Tower of Frozen Shadow (Awesome Zone, just like crystal caverns). At this point this is all we can do in Velious. CC and ToFS... The reason? I as a Druid, and generally raid leader and organizer cannot fight anywhere else. We cannot go to kael because the stuff we can fight gives poor exp, bad faction for alot of our evil people (we are about half and half), and without them we are not strong enough to fight farther in. We cannot go to skyshrine because of the exact opposite. I like the quests in Thurgadin/kael/skyshrine but you have made it nearly impossible to complete 90% of them. It is sad really, I am tempted to go to skyshrine and just forget about faction, but then what? It's a viscous circle that is more tedious then enjoyable. It is a good idea, but a bad implementation. Make it so that we can tip our factinos back and forth fairly easily, so we can work our faction back and forth and be able to fight with our friends, not stand around and watch frustrated while they die and I can do nothing to save them. If you want to keep the factions "permanent" then make them less volitile so we have more places to fight on special occasions atleast.<P>Problem: Resistences. They are simply insane, I as a druid am left to buffing and healing. Nuking by myself or most other casters in most of Velious is a joke. I understand you are trying to keep people challenged, but now you have verged no the unbalancing and the frustrating. Further widening the gap between the usefull(Warriors, Rouges, Clerics, Chanters) and the sometimes hazerdous (the rest of us). <BR>Solution: Honestly at this point we are in a pretty deep hole. You have continuously made broad changes throughout the life of the game to make this a problem. How? you made the classes that are best at what they do necessary when you made things more challenging. Why would you want to risk bringing a druid on a raid, who cannot do a whole lot to help the group that another class could do considerbly better. Not that I dislike Druids, I love being a Druid for many reasons, but I use us as an example of pretty useless raid members. I really feel bad for the SK's and Necro's too, talk about feeling useless on a raid... How can you repair this? well in retrospect instead of trying to make "jack of all trades" classes, you should have always thrown in something unique. Even if it meant having less classes, EVERY class should offer something unique and truly valuable to every party. I could go on for days on this, but I think you get my point. Still, I respect your current efforts to look into this, so what can be done past that? How about making the individual mobs a little less resistent to some of us then others. Although being a Druid I cannot offer what a Wizard or a Cleric can to a group, if my resist rates were lower then them, atleast I would then be offering something (again using druids soley as an example as i know them best). This would hold true for all classes, but more so for some then others. Although overall I think Wizards should be less resisted, those poor guys cant do a damn thing against velious mobs, next to useless  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>Problem/Solution: The Single Group Solution. Try it for yourselves. Make a single group, of whatever you want at whatever level you want and see how many places in velious you can conqeur and/or atleast fight in. <P>Eastern Wasters: sure but besides orc fort what is there to do.<P>Crystal Caverns: Kudos! Awesome zone! Now just let us raise faction here!<P>Iceclad: Nothing to do<P>Great Divide: Well done zone although broodmother is horribly bugged when she is quest activated to prowl the zone, and end up becoming an NPC pet.<P>Velk's Labrynth: Lol... you try and take a single group anywhere past zone, its insane. Resists are nutty, rewards are few, CR is near impossible without a necro, and the 1200 point uncureable poison off the green mob at the zone is rediculous. Beautifull though, just repopulate it.<P>Kael: Wonderfull zone, terrible risk/reward, agro/trains from hell. This zone needs to be reitemzied to match skyshrine as well as be tweaked. Allow a small group to fight a certain distance in without too much risk, as is now a "insta death" mob can come running right through where you are trying to fight, one that would be tough for a raid to take on let alone a single group. Move the NPC's around so this zone has a place for the single group to fight as well as the raid.<P>Wakening Lands: Make Wuoshi low agro, smaller radius. Just makes Druids/Wizards teleporting ability worthless in velious. Re itemize this zone as well, nothing usefull drops here.<P>Thurgadin: Wonderfull City! Just incredible. My complaint honestly is in including them in the triangle. Again as nice an idea as it is, it just alienates people. Its totally against what Verant has always promoted, being social. Just seperate some of these faction, more later on this.<P>Skyshrine: I would so love to fight it in this zone, but only because the risk vs. reward is nice, but alas I am a Druid and have pretty little choice. Do something about this faction, it just alienates me from friends.<P>Sirens Grotto: I think you know this one. What went through this designers head? Good lord this isnt even situational. Nuke this zone and start from scratch, its screwed.<P>Cobalt Scar: Again make the portal more useable. Good zone otherwise. <P>Beyond: I'll let others speak for me here, some of my more global comments apply here too.<P>Faction Idea: How about something along these lines.<P>Giants vs. Dwarfs<BR>This makes sense, you can bind both places, bank both places, and travel through both places reasonably safely. Make it so that you can work your faction back and forth though. Maybe neither would ever love you, but atleast they would tolerate you as they would a bounty hunter or similar. Maybe make the Dwarfs hate the Giants, but the Giants on the other hand dislike the dwarfs, but brush them off as a small threat and to be dealt with at a later date. This way you could fight both places as long as you kept your faction balanced! I could fight with my friends knowing I could set things back to center with some easy effort later on.  <P>Dragons vs Giants<BR>Make it possible it bank and bind in skyshrine, for everyone. Make it the same situation as the giants vs dwarfs, but do not attach dragons to dwarfs. They should hate each other, you should not be unkos to both ever, but it should be possible again to flip/flop.

As such, while they attended the raids, they did not participate. <P>Some of the druids did tp people in/out, but that's about it for them.<P>A few of them, while they took no visible faction hits, went from amiable to KOS. GMs refused to reset their faction.<P>This is unacceptable. If you are going to take a faction hit...we want to see it!

</FONT><HR><BR>Think I spent all of 2 nights in Velious.  Overall the zones look great but in terms of content for the high-level (55+) semi-casual gamer, it's just not there.<P>Where's the zones like Sebilis or Karnors where you at least have some slim hope of getting in a pickup group?  Please remember that not everyone is in a guild, or has the desire to spend their night rounding up 12+ people just to be able to do things in a zone.<P>Sebilis is a good example of a zone done right IMO.  If you're lucky you can get in a group, go camp a spot for a few hours, have a decent chance at some good loot, and get decent xp while you're at it.  I was terribly disappointed to find not one single zone in Velious similar to this.<P>Aside from the new spells made available, Velious was just a waste of my $30.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Kael Drakkel:<P>Not everyone wants to align themselves with the dorfs.  Other than the novelty of it there's really no reason to pick this side.  Thurgadin has merchants out the rear while there's a few Kromriff merchants and some Kromzek that still won't deal with me.  The few merchants there are sell nothing of value.  <P>Things I'd like to see done to the zone:<BR>-Add more merchants with trade skill materials.<BR>-Add forge/oven etc..<BR>-Either lighten the faction requirements to complete quests, make faction easier to gain, or leave the first 2 and seriously beef up the rewards.  A good example of this is Giant Scalemail armor.  Some pieces are chain only classes can wear,  some druids can wear, some all classes can wear.  Only 2 good pieces are the sleeves with AC 11 +3 wis that druids can wear and the legs AC 11 +3 int -3 wis +20hp that ALL classes can wear.  Also looks like Blacked iron from Runnyeye.<BR>-Kromzek faction raises far too slowly compared to Kromriff.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I went to Velius with the hopes of gettting into a good group (as a 50 bard I can solo but I enjoy my time in a group better than running around backwards aggroing everything in the zone). <BR>The problem is this, everywhere I went (I play after Midnight PST to around 3-4 am PST) I couldn't find a group, there we're no melee's in sight apart from the occasional warrior or monk begging to be invised inside Kael.  As I was heading into Kael (on the path not the wall) I fell for 10k damage, got a Rez and said "Screw Velius".  Look for me in Karnors.  Velius sucks for melee types, (even when you can invis/adjust faction) I ended up leading several groups of people through Kael with bard invis, and me factionsonged.  And even that was buggy.  Fix the bugs and give melee's somewhere to bind (forget about that dwarf town, who wants someone in their group that has to travel 5 zones to do CR everytime they die?) then I'll check out Velius.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Individual NPC difficulty:<P>Other than they hit 10 levels harder than mob's of that level everywhere else in the world?<BR>A huge percentage run faster then Jboots?<BR>Most can see through Invis?<BR>VERY little is available for the solo 50+ person. I know that the Vision dictates that grouping is good, solo is bad. I hate the huge inefficiency of grouping and almost never group. Get over yourselves. Give me something to hunt other than farm greenies for loot.<P>Typical Encounter Difficulty (single group? two or three groups? full raid?):<P>Well, since almost everything is GREEN to a lv 50+ they are not too difficult for a solo person, let alone a group. I have noticed they hit WAY harder than they should. Obviously this is a attempt to increase peoples recovery time. You must think people are stupid to not notice this stuff.<P>Since grouping is EVIL and INEFFICENT I do not have much in the way of grouping experience, let alone 2 or 3 groups. The difficulty of these areas is just stupid when we are forced to use the aging technology of the EQ system.<BR>Massive link deaths, mob's poofing. 30 people fighting in a zone can cause it to crash? What a bunch of bull! You can keep it.<BR>No uber loot for me! My connection can't handle the load.<BR>Absolutely NO encounter should require over two full groups AT THE MOST!<P>Treasure quality given the typical encounter difficulty:<P>You ARE kidding right?<BR>I harvest lv 38-42 dragons and all they carry is a hand full of change. One in a thousand will have a spell that is invariably useless to me or one of my numerous twinks.<BR>So, a lv 40 mob can't afford more than a burger from the local McDonalds. I'll pass.<BR>Gnolls carry armor that is better than the old class specific armor, is far easier to get and sells for far more. Since I can't make money on stuff my level guess where I hang out and "bottom feed"? DUH!<BR>If I want to make cash and not subject myself to the insanity of eBay I go to the giants of Permafrost or Rathe Mts.<BR>I got my robe from Skyshrine. Why should I go back? No reason? That's what I though.<P><BR>Fun:<P>Define fun.<BR>Sitting on your butt watching a spot on the snow for a known mob, carrying known loot, to spawn after a known amount of time, at a known level in NOT fun.<BR>Your alternative is to roam hundreds of square miles of colorless wasteland looking for something worthy of your attention and skills. Notice that you have to avoid numerous greenies that can kill you in 30 seconds (they give nothing BTW, are just a danger that you can easily avoid by sitting on your butt at a X in the snow). BTW, almost nothing that roams compares in loot to that known mob with known loot.<BR>You want to do a raid. Fine, now spend the next 2-3 hours collecting 30+ people from all over the world, having them run through very dangerous areas, re-connecting from numerous link deaths due to server over-crowding and CR. You are all set to go. Sorry, took too long. People have to start going now. Raid is canceled. Maybe next week. Boy, that was fun! Wasn't it? NOT!<P><BR>Anything that jumps out as a big problem in the zone, such as "The zone would be fun if it wasn't for....":<P>OMG, where to start! Notice Eastern Wastes. Notice where all the people are? Roaming around having fun? Nope.<BR>How about clustered around the few static spawn points farming for loot, bored to tears?<BR>Yep.<BR>This usually involves KS'ing, bickering and all of the other negative things associated with too many people, not enough places for them to be.<BR>Are you people BLIND! This is the way it has been since Beta 1 and you still stick with this model. You put in MASSIVE zones and 99% of it goes to waste.<BR>But, oh, see this area? It chock full of wandering mob's just waiting to be engaged. Too bad a somewhat safe place to pull to is half the zone away! Nothing like being fully engaged and have a couple roamers join in the fun. Hope a 49+ Cleric is in the area. Boy, hope I can get back to my body so I don't lose all my equipment. Good thing I have my hand-to-hand skill maxed. I sure have to use it a lot on all the naked Warrior CR runs Verant has decided I like. /rude Verant<BR>You NEED to populate these areas like the Orc camps in South Ro. The occasional roamer is OK, but not when you can not engage the stuff you are camping because the roamers come by every 30 seconds and hit like Hill Giants!<P>Big problems:<P>Not enough Vendors, both in Kunark and Velious. Put in some damm Gypsy camps. Look at Rathe Mts and copy it. Good, Neutral and Evil vendors all over the place. Whats wrong with that? You know why people call most of the drops crap? Because that 13lb Bronze BP is not worth carring three zones to get a couple plat for it, that's why. It's just gets dumped on the ground as, well, crap.<P>Ever wonder why the world is crawling with Druids? Duh! Teleports and SoW. Travel aids. If it is going to take me a couple hours to get somewhere and I can't bind close you think I am going to have ANY interest in going there? I DON'T THINK SO!<BR>And you wonder why so many zones are under-utilized? Sheesh, just ask a player about travel. SoW and TP potions? Talk to my hand on that one.<P>I can take on a mob that has 3k HP and hits for dual 65's and that's all they do. Or I can take on a mob that has 3k HP and hits for dual 65's, casts 700 point nukes, Poison DoT's, SoW, Gate's and has a pet.<BR>They both have exactly the same loot, lunch money. The caster does NOT hit for less, does NOT have less HP, does NOT have better loot.<BR>Ever wonder why Lake of ill Omen and The Overthere are so popular. DUH! No casters! And you can see them farther than a few feet away (rocky, wood zones). Even then, where are the people? With their back to a wall where they can be reasonably sure that they wont be jumped every 30 seconds by something that hit's for dual 90's.<BR>Now look at Droga. No escape, twisty tunnels, everything social agros, casters galore, crap loot, horrible pathing. You think I am going in there with less than some 50's? Pshaw, yeah right!<P>This game has such great potential to be so much more than it is.

</FONT><HR>1) Was it your intention to make casters useless? The resists are ridiculous -- unmezzable, unrootable, blah blah blah.<P>2) Do an experiment. Take a mid-30s group and grab a blue mob from Mistmoore, a blue mob from FV, and a blue mob from anyplace in SoV. The Kunark mob is anywhere from 30-50% tougher than the MM mob. The SoV mob is more like twice as tough. Your /con system is a joke.<P>3) Please, please please stop designing 25% of the new zones to service 1% of the server population.

</FONT><HR>I only have a few points to make.  First off is Siren's Grotto, too much like Kaesora, no wait, you could actually kill things in Kaesora without wiping out 3 groups first.  Revamp the zone into what could be a popular hangout like sebilis or guk.<P>Secondly comes East Wastes, probably the most populated zone on SoV.  Making exp viable for 50+ again would be cool to see (more oracle-style camps, or roamers of a similar difficulty running around a small section of the zone).  The bridge camp by the bridge was my only reason for coming to the zone.  My server isn't known for uber-level raids, we only just cleared air yesterday, killed Wuoshi once about a few weeks ago. <P>My only other gripe would be to have a few more accessible mobs or soloable quests for king faction (Dain, Yelinak, and Tormax). I really want to explore Kael, but fear of running into one of the giants on Tormax faction is keeping me from doing so.<P>Thanks for listening (reading, whatever)  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
