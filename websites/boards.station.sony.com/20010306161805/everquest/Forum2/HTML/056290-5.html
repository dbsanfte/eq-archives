</FONT><HR>We dont WANT to be mana pumps, dont reduce to this, there are many good ideas out there that will make us more groupable, yet not unbalanced. Group FD, and targetable life to mana transfers (their life to thier mana) would both make us highly desireable in a group without giving us more soloing power. Above all DONT nerf us, leave our lich line be! Look into making our post 49th level pets worthwhile. Lower teh resistsance on either our dd or a tap line so we feel we actually can do something vs uber mobs. WE DONT WANT OT BE MANA PUMPS, DONT REDUCE US TO THAT, if we wanted to be in the background as a support character we would play a enchanter cleric or bard. Dont force us out of our role, the masters of life death and the undead.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here's some suggestions I wouldn't mind for necro's.<P>1. Nothing is more discouraging than playing a character knowing full well that when you reach your max potential you'll be next to useless in an uber raid.<P>2. Since ignite bones is nothing but a real anoyance to tanks it'd be nice if you could at least cast undead only spells on those mobs while they are still in bone form, that way, it'd eliminate the people complaining that you can't chain nuke.<P>3. Defoliate, a lev 34 spell, drops off a 50 mob. I realize it's a high lev spell for some other class.<P>4. There are so many necro items that give minuses for a LOT of things... it'd be nice at least if all those minuses to charisma would benefit in some way, like making undead charms last longer instead of shorter, improved fear... that type of thing. I mean... are we supposed to look good?<P>People think necros are the most powerful class. I think people just don't know the potential of their own class, perhaps once that was the case but necro's have been nerfed so much in the past they aren't any more powerful than any other class. I've seen good players in many different classes solo for a long time and do very well.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Of all the idea around here, I think the reanimation of the dead is the most interesting one. Unfortunatly just having any NPC pet without the risks that come with charming a pet would be a little too powerful. So I propose one of two things.<P>- Have the pet poof after a certain amount of time. This way the pet would pose about the same risks as having a charmed pet during a fight.<P>or<P>- Make the spell have a side-effect of either draining hp or mana over time. This way you have control of how long you keep the pet, but you might end up getting rid of the pet after a while because the maintenance cost would be too high to continue. So you would end up having a stronger pet compared to the old skeleton pet, but there is higher risk to keeping it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'd like to comment on the first post again.<P>&gt;&gt;And, well, the necromancer is a pretty powerful class as they are now.<P>Do you honestly believe with all your heart that that is true? Close your eyes, take a deep breath, check out the message boards at http://necro.eqclasses.com/forums   look into the mirror, look at yourself, and say it if you have no shame.<P>&gt;&gt;The primary issues that I see revolve around the battle with the boss monsters.<P>This issue just tells you that the necromancer is a pretty useless class as they are now.<P>&gt;&gt;I have to warn you that since we will be looking closely at this class we may very well feel that something needs to have its power reduced to achieve balance.<P>Remove the 22 spells I mentioned. Those are all powerful spells, and removing them will reduce our power that will achieve the balance you seek.<P>&gt;&gt;Lifetaps: The number one request is to allow Lifetaps to land on the big monsters.<P>This is probably the solution. There are details in my previous posts.<P>&gt;&gt;If we are telling necromancers that they have a valid place at the final encounter because they can give mana to other casters, then they will need a way to regain mana.<P>Remove that mana transfer spell, it is too powerful.<P>&gt;&gt;Perhaps, if made in conjunction with the fixing the bug in Lich, then perhaps this could be balanced.<P>Remove the spell and its line completely, no need to fix the feature which you insist on calling a bug. It will all balance out.<P>&gt;&gt;Mana transfer: Again, if their ‘place’ against the boss mob is to transfer mana.<P>From day one, beta phase 4, when the game was released, necromancers could not transfer mana. 1 year and a half later, they could. I sincerely believe that was a mistake. Remove the mana transfer spells, and you will reduce our power.<P>&gt;&gt;But this could certainly be considered if we fix the bug with the Lich spells.<P>Persistent ignoramus (fact, not a flame, not an opinion, just stating that you don't know what you are talking about). I do not see a bug, you need more than a pair of glasses my friend, or perhaps a better optalmologist. Remember that the line of spells has been in place for more than 2 years, or more than 730 real time days, or 17520 hours.<P>Let me show you what I mean by the above.<P>Persistent:<BR>Refusing to give up or let go; persevering obstinately. <BR>Insistently repetitive or continuous <BR>Existing or remaining in the same state for an indefinitely long time; enduring<P>You seem to be extremely persistent about a bug.<P>ignoramus \ig-nuh-RAY-mus\, noun:<BR>An ignorant person; a vain pretender to knowledge; a dunce. <P>He is a tedious fraud and ignoramus, a cheap rogue and hypocrite, the eternal Jack of the human pack. He deserves all that he ever suffers under our economic system, and more. Any city man, not insane, who sheds tears for him is shedding the tears of the crocodile. <BR>--H.L. Mencken, "The Husbandman"<P>I do believe that you don't play a Necromancer, even if you converse with people in the team that claim to play Necromancers. You simply do not have first hand high-level experience of the class.<P>In any case, a reduction of the necromancer power by the elimination of 22 spells should balance the class in exchange for the single most requested enhancement: bring back Lifetaps the way they were when the game first started. At the very least, for characters above Level 45.<P>Of course, there are other notable ideas (either from myself or other people) that have been discussed previously. Just don't put "bugs" into the picture or you will lose more respect from the community. You've already lost some, don't lose it all.<P><BR>Dadok (Rodcet Nife)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Saying that the tranfer rate of Lich is bugged 2 years into the game is absurd. Lich is one of the essential spells of the necromancer. The mana that it generates comes at a terrible cost--our lives. And yes I have died from it many times out of carelessness and because once I gated within the same zone to some guards and they promptly killed me. This spell is dangerous and risky to use and is not FREE mana at all.<P>Lich has contributed to the totality of what people perceive as the power of a necromancer. We have suffered more nerfs than any other class in this game in the name of balance. I believe we have already paid 10 times over for the power of Lich.<P>Another problem with Lich is the fact that when I meditate it causes me to see the graphics "under the world" and is very disorienting. I have to use Dead Man Floating on myself just to be able to med and see the chat screen.<P>I just don't think it's fair or appropriate to hang this potential Lich nerf over the heads of the necromancer class at a time when we as a class are on the brink of extinction post lvl 50. There are fewer and fewer people playing necros post lvl 50. Every necro I've talked to is getting exasperated with the fact that we are not desired in groups or on raids post lvl 50.<P>Go ahead and nerf Lich and I guarantee you will kill the necromancer class. Why does this have to be like "Let's Make A Deal"? Why do we have to consider getting a defining spell nerfed just so we can contribute in uber raids? Character advancement should be about becoming more powerful not weaker. Sadly, this is the path the necromancer is heading down unless something is done soon.<P> Dornette<BR> 54 necromancer<BR> The Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>some suggestions:<P>Make convergence able to resurect bodies older than the 2 or 3 hours limit the cleric line now has. <P>Raiding bossess: give us a special pet you can only summon using an EE. Give it total resistance, and a high damage output and let it suicide after the death of his target. At that cost you can bet we will only use it for those really special encounters. Just don't make it a washed out level 49 pet, make it good please. PS. also don't make this a level 60 spell, drop only. Make it 55 or so and attainable by a reasonable quest.<P>Make coffins more available, I'm KOS in Neriak and have never been in PoS. If possible, move Conjure corpse down a few levels. 57 is rather high.<P>Make a targetable FD, with consent of the target. Like the resurection line, so you can't abuse it.<P><BR>Thank you<P>Duister, 54 gnecro of Brell<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>In making these change please be careful not to unduly effect the pre-50 necro game experience.  I'll admit I had a lot of fun as a necro pre-50, I think others should have that same chance.  Also, it should be noted that necros can increase thir level incredibly fast....there has to be a prenalty for that somewhere.  I assumed the post-50 game to be that place.  I think we need to ask whether the 1% or so of the server population should be trying to change the game for all necros because they have trouble with less than 1% of the MOB's in the game.  To be quite honest necros are fine as they are...leave us alone.  The only neat thing I've seen on here is the Gruop DMF idea.<BR>Abashi, Verant, whomever....keep yer grubby paws off our class!

(As for those of you who say they're never for sale, they are...they're just very rare.

If they're very rare, people would save them for special circumstances.  <P>Of course, they shouldn't be so rare, as to make their cost more than 500-1000pp, since that's what essence emeralds sell for these days.<P>Also, dear God, please do not put the drops on a static spawn that will be camped 24/7.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Looking back at being a level 50 necro before Kunark came out I would say our class was too powerful. I think that is a given. Although we still sucked the big one on Uber or Boss mobs there was only a couple of those and it didnt matter all that much.<P>With the expansion being released and geared towards grouping we lost quite a bit of our desirablitiy. Then once SoV came out the post 50 and especially the post 55 necro really took a hit.<P>If this is a grouping game should you be able to just grab 6 peeople and head out for some exp anywhere? Sure a cleric is the best healer and the chanter is the best at crowd control but the alternatives arent anywhere near as effective. A good Bard is effective and a cleric is irreplaceable because no one can rezz because the component on a necro it too expensive to rezz in a group situation.<P>So that said I think we should get 2 upgrades to screaming terror. One single target and one area effect. Anytime a necro has to replace an enchanter in a group they are unlikely to keep their pets which makes us not a damage dealer anymore.<P>If we are screwed for life and suppose to be a mana battery on Epic or Uber encounters then I think we should have a spell like complete heal for mana. It would take half our mana and completely fill the targets mana. That would solve the need for a ton of clerics on Epic Encounters and would also allow more than 1 or 2 necros on a raid.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>While I would like to be more effective in boss encounters I DO NOT consider this the most important issue facing Necros post 50, nor do I consider it enough of an inducement for me to give up the effects of Lich as they stand now. In my mind the most important balancing issue facing Necromancers is making their presence more compelling in GROUPS in DUNGEONS. Our dots work too slowly, we have few direct damage spells, and the ones we do have hit for low damage and have an effect that the group would rather us not use. Someone has already mentioned fast acting dots which would only work INDOORS, thus not effecting the balance of power with regards to fear kiting outdoors. I would urge you to consider these as a possible enhancement for my class.<P>I would propose that by altering the way lich works and merely changing the way drains or bond of death work on boss encounters, you will have effectively made Necromancers even less demanded by pickup groups in dungeons. It is the necromancers mana pool and self sufficiency that by and large make them useful in a group. The ONLY reason to invite casters of any sort into a high level dungeon is to assist the cleric, tanks, and enchanters by taking down the mobs faster. Necros can not do this well. So except for our pets which are not always wanted, our role is better handled by another caster class.<P>I do not think it appropriate to focus so much on the very vocal MINORITY of level 60 Necromancers who are willing to give away the farm to merely be effective in the only encounters left for THEM. I am level 53 now and with my play style I dont expect to be level 60 for another year if ever. The purpose of these balancing discussions should be to make the class better and easier to have fun with by all levels of a particular class not just level 60's.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here's some simple logic:<P>Necromancers do not have mana transfer spells when the game first started. It was put in one year later, and not by the choice of the necro community either. Thus, this new ability that 95% of necros do not like is forced upon the class. To make mana transfer their sole role at the end of the road when 95% necromancers do not willingly choose to have it is to tell everyone Verant is worried it's earning too much money.<P>But this may be Verant's only chance to right the wrong before too much damage is done. This 95% of the necro community is now telling you straight in the face: TAKE AWAY the whole line. They did not choose to have it. It is forced upon them. Now they tell you to remove it. Is this not reasonable?<P>You can ignore a paladin that complains he doesn't like LoH ability and would like it replaced. You CANNOT ignore a necromancer that complains he doesn't like mana transfer. He did not choose to have this line when he first started his character. If 95% of the necro community liked this new spell that was put in half way through the game, it would've been a completely different story altogether.<P>More on bias to the necro class. I feel compelled to agree with recent posts that say if you have to nerf a class to improve it, then simply leave the hell of it alone. I need say no more.<P>Thanks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>If Verant is looking to 'balance' the necromancer class yet again, then actual testing should be done against uber mobs, high reds, low reds, yellows, and blues found in the game in relation to the other classes.  If we are to be one of only two primary pet classes in the game, then compare our success rate, damage dealing ability, survivability, group contribution, and pet effectiveness as compared to a magician of the same level.  In addition, since we are also a caster, we should be able to hit any given mob with roughly the same percent of success as any other caster.  If, in a situation, we necros cannot hit jack squat but lower level magicians, wizards, and enchanters are sticking almost every cast, then something is seriously broken with our class.  If our pet or even a 50+ necro pet gets wasted by 40's level magician pet, then again something is seriously broken with our class.  Also, make the 56 and 59 pet scrolls drop a bit more easily, otherwise you get uber guild ownership of them and since we can't group very well, we don't get them very often.  And lastly, having us necromancers be a 'mana battery' is absolutely wrong, it would be like having a wizard or druid along only because they could evac...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have seen several posts saying that maybe Necros should get some group buffs to make them more viable in the end game. While it is true that this would make them more attractive to a group, I don't want to be a druid casting damage shields, or a shaman casting group buffs. I want to be what a Necro was meant to be, a master of terror and damaging DOTs. I haven't personally experienced corpses poofing due to DOTs, I don't know if it is specific only to raids. If it is happening, fix it. Then make the DOTs more effective in group roles. Take the Heat Blood series. Decrease it's duration, keep the same damage and increase it's mana cost. A caster with a 500 point DOT at 29th level that deals out all of it's damage in 48 seconds or even 30 seconds, would be a very valuable member (which in a good group, very rarely do battles last much longer than 30 seconds).<P>Another problem I have with this game on a whole is why are some damage spells fully resisted at all? Sure if the mob is several levels higher than you, it should almost fully resist some stuff. Of course the mind affecting spells have to be an all or nothing effect (fear, mez, screaming terror). But if a spell deals out damage, it shouldn't be an all or nothing proposition, it should do no less than half.<P><BR>Troy<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I want to reply something to Eduin who provides some of his ideas why necros should be nerfed.<P>First of all I have to agree with him that necros were designed very poorly in the first place and have been way overpowered in the past. I would say this was pretty much true until Verant removed the delay 19 daggers from necro pets (a year ago).<P>From then on necros have been pretty much down to earth and their popularity in groups declined rapidly.<P>The common belief was that necros very still vastly overpowered so the following thing happend: With RoK Verant gave necros 2 very important spells at 51 (Envenomed Bolt and Splurt) and NOTHING afterwards. I am serious on this....necros basically get NOTHING IN COMPARISON TO OTHER CLASSES past lvl 51. This leads to the fact that the necro class reaches its peak at 51 and drops off FAST. A 60 necromancer is a whimp!<BR>My own necro is 57 now and I am used to play with lots of 60 necros. They are simply a joke. All they do is powermed and twitch the cleric while their funny weakling pet is fighting. Remember that tests showed no difference in power between 49 and 59 pet!!!!!! DoT is too slow for groups!<P>To everyone who thinks that necros are overpowered and way too strong I suggest the following:<BR>Go to character selection screen and make one!<BR>I suggested this to many people and they usually quit the necro pretty fast. <BR>Necros SUCK!<BR>Why play a necro when you see how strong magicians are at 55+?? I don't want to get into the epic thing here....just look at the size of the mage epic pet!<BR>If I had the choice again I would never go through 110 days of wasted time again and start a mage instead!<P>Neric Soulstalker (57 nec Xegony)<P>here is a list of my other characters:<BR>Shandrax Illuminis (60 enc Xegony)<BR>Crono (51 mnk Solusek Ro)<BR>Selias Evenstar (49 dru Xegony)<BR>Tarok Vanguard (23 mnk Xegony)<BR>Turiel Selo (20 brd Xegony)<BR>Torge (9 sha Xegony)<BR>Torge (9 sha Rallos Zek)<BR>Xeran (9 cle Xegony)<BR>Yzmael (8 SK Xegony)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Another thing about ST:<BR>Necros are enchanters vs. undead (charm undead line) so IMO we should get undead mez like chanters too! -&gt; with Dazzle undead at lvl 55 for example.<BR>ST working on non-undead is WRONG! It is as wrong as cleric nukes vs. non-undead. From a role-playing perspective necros rule undead and nothing else and cleric give live instead of taking it!<P>Neric</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Couple things...<P>I'll be honest, although I've played a necro up to and including the 50+ levels as a grouping necro,  (probably 90% of my played time is grouped not solo) I do find Verant redefining what my class can do as just mana feed in uber raids rather depressing.<P>What should the focus be on?  How to make necros more group friendly in general, and how to allow them to actually participate in the uber monster raids in the final fights? (without changing the ability to solo positively or negatively) That should be the focus of this thread.<P>I still didn't see such simple modifications as a group dead man floating on your list.  Doesn't affect soloing...is useful in group situations only.<P>I agree some great changes were made to the class, I do use the 'scent' line to help land my own spells and those others in group using fire/dis/pois.  I think screaming terror was both a great grouping spell as well as it was a great addition to my soloing ability if I choose to do so.<P>I also wanted to voice my opinion about a change to the lich series.  First off a change now...at least a year + down the road since the PvP spell damage change would majorly throw things out of whack.  Also, I really fail to see why it needs to be labelled as a 'bug' now, when it could have been fixed long long long ago.  Why are we giving up something that works ok as it is, in order to get the ability to actually do something in an uber monster encounter?<P>We get to land lifetaps, but change lich series?  Um, I really fail to understand the logic.  I still am taking damage, I still need to lifetap to heal myself or be healed while I mana feed. <P>I've heard the argument by some that well, you're a necro...you can solo levels 1-50 and now at 50+ you should pay for it.  Guess what?  Wrong...I played a grouping necro levels 1-50, why should I be penalized now at 50-60?  I choose to use my versatility (2nd really only to enchanter) to help my group do things they could not normally do and I did that for 50 levels.  Please PLEASE Absor put some time into working on necros as far as group usefulness and let us participate in these uber raid encounters.<P>Thanks,<P>Mindreaver<P>P.S.  Also, reading back at some of powerbaits comments, I believe some of them borderline on not only inflamatory but antagonistic towards other posters.  Either add something productive to the thread, or stop posting.  Someone at Verant should send him a warning.  We need constructive thinking here on this thread, not what he's bringing to the discussion.  A good 7 day vacation from EQ and posting might cool his heels a bit.<BR>   <P>  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Necromancers are powerful.  In terms of "class balance", I do not think there is much that should be added or detracted from Necromancers, as they currently stand.  Necromancers do very well soloing.  It stands to reason that they should do less well while in a group because of their obvious benefit when alone.  However, it is really quite a tragedy that more necromancers are not able to enjoy deep dungeon hunting and well balanced groups as frequently as the other classes.  This more social aspect is really what makes EQ the great game it is, and even arguably becomes a necessity to really enjoy the higher levels (epic quests, large raids, etc).  I recommend these minor changes:<P>1. Allure of death line of spells may be "broken" from Verant's point of view, but is, in fact, better implemented the way it is now, than perhaps originally intended.  Currently, the loss in hit points is painful, and fact the spell is self only is painful, but this is offset by the accelerated gain in mana --which can make the spell worth it.  By increasing the hit point cost, you increase the risk of the spell, and as it stands there are already times I have gone with clarity over the allure line when in a group, either due to risk or pull speed.  If the life loss was even more severe than it is now, the spell line would only be a "use when no enchanter is present" solo spell, which actually takes away from one of the very FEW desirable group advantages a necro has, slightly less downtime.<P>2. Like Shamans and druids received increases in healing to make them slightly more group viable, Necros need increases mezzing to make them more group viable.  Screaming Terror helped get into a few groups when I first got it, and this adds an interesting new role to the group Necro.  Necros should not be as a good as an enchanter at mezzing.  However, it would make them MUCH more group friendly if the disparity between the two classes were not as severe.  Groups might look for an enchanter first, but if they couldn't find one, maybe would consider a necro.  As it now, if they can't find an enchanter, groups just assume "it can't be done" and go hunt somewhere safer, and more boring.  <P>3. Transfer mana line of spells is a very "necro" like ability.  Necros generally don't like the transfer mana role in groups, because it is very boring --but it is also very in character.  A necro's enhanced mana generation from eh allure line is bent to aiding others generate mana faster.  The necro contributes further by tapping mobs for life, to feed his life hungry mana generation spell.  However, these line of spells could be powered up a bit, to make groups a little hungry for them.  As it is now, it is more of a novelty rather than something a group would seek out.<P>4. Necros can heal others by helping themselves.  This is role most necros HATE, because lost life means lost mana ...but it is an interesting group role.  Necros have very interesting methods of generating life, perhaps a few more ways to lose it by giving it out might make them  more group friendly.  As it stands now, the transfer of life is inefficient, and relatively slow to the point where it makes it almost pointless to use it, and not something a group would seek.  Perhaps a few tweaks here could give the necro a very in character thing to do.<P>Finally, and nothing to do with group balance, I think the necro resurrect spell (which I haven't used yet), would be very in character if it turned its target into a skeleton for the duration of the resurrection effects.  This would just be neat. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The new (on test) pet control spells are a good idea. But I don't have another spell slot for it, and if a pet gets lost I don't have time to mem it and cast, I'll be dead by then. <P>Since this is to fix the bug of lost pets can it be an ability? Since pets shouldn't be getting lost in the first place I can't see this being too powerful, pets would just be working more as they should have been intended. Right now I just invis myself and cast another, so being able to summon this one back merely saves me two bone chips and the annoyance.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
