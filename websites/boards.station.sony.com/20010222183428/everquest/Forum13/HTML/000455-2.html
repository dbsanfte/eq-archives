</FONT><HR>I am glad to see several good ideas collected on your list, BUT I miss one of our two major problems. <P>FD<P>a) Why keep a lot of mobs beeting on us, even after we feigned successfull (1, 2, 3 or more times).<P>b) Why are we forced to /q to wipe the agro list? Its after all the same effect, but it sucks to be forced to do it this way. Whats THAT bad as it is below lvl 32 ? If you really need a change that bad, reduce the chance for a agro list wipe from 100% to lets say 80%, but not to 33%.<P>The FD problems are really a MAIN issue for almost every monk and that fact really doesnt show up on the list.<P>Thanks for your time</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Rather than continue the endless debate about what we want/need, how about correcting the list as it stands?  (Directed towards those who will still be complaining when monks can T-kick for Ice Comet damage and CH themselves on a Mend.)<P><BR>Great list, Absor.  Just a couple minor corrections so that you'll have it all straight when you take these to the team.<P>ITEM: Appearances.<P>--  Remove.  The between the new tailored armor (for the high level monks) and gnome skin armor (for mid level monks), there are different appearances out there.  Sure, it might involve sacrifices stat-wise, but you gotta pay for fashion.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>ITEM: Treant Fists.<P>--  Typo.  Should be "Gem [b]E[/b]ncrusted".<P>Possible addition:<P>-- I've always thought it would be cool if monks could get a mask like the Guise of the Deceiver, but that would make them the opposite monk race. It wouldn't give human monks the benefits that the Iksar have, but it might allow them the faction to do the Shackles quests.  A mask to allow Iksars to appear as humans could allow them to do the sash/headband quests as well.<P>Great list;  if you get even two of the items on it implemented, it would be great for us.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Kienster<BR>56 Master<BR>Xegony<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I am happy to see you have compiled a list which contains the most important elements from my point of view.<P>I feel most monks 55+ simply want a solid increase in damage output, not defensive abilities, and we could care less excactly how it was given to us. That - and fixing FD vs. high level mobs.<P>In the first post you questioned whether monks needed a damage increase or not. As a result you really scared the vast majority of high level monks. I do hope you hope you have concluded that we do, and I look forward to again be a viable group member for the right reason : High damage output. We'll leave the tanking to the War/Pal/SKs.<P>Anyway, I think you did great sifting through all our whining and not-too-great ideas, and ended up with the better ones on your list.

</FONT><HR>I am only a lowly monk but the thing I feel is missing is an ability to interrupt casters. Obviously I dont know if we can do this later in levels but reading the posts it appears we cant. I know at my current level (16 - one from the glories of Feign!!) I have trouble taking down an orc priest. I would get him low on health then he would heal. I am not even going to go into the green madmen in Oasis - I see them and run away QUICKLY. This shouldnt really be the case as you would have thought it would be quite difficult to cast with a monk punching you in the head. <BR>Just my thought  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My one thing is on the chain kicks, why wait till 50?  At 36 I can't solo blues successfully without burning thru 6 bubs of health (after mending) and great luck, why? Because I am not uber geared up. The thing is that the twinked ubers will always be  MOB killers but the casual player will always be a step behind no matter what. That is what really needs to be addressed (besides fd of course), why wait for 50 for the fun stuff, why not like 40 and  give the casuals something to hope for, getting riposte at 35 was something to strive for, now really whats next besides the disciplines at 50?  I seem to have more fun on my shaman or warrior going for that next skill/spell, where now I have 14 levels of hoping to beat farmers to a mob or killing greens for loot to try to buy the uber armor and weapons that I cant get because I don't have a big brother watching over me. I like my monk character but it is just becoming less fun overtime, you max your skills but it doesnt seem to matter.<BR>Just a chain of thought rant, maybe someone agrees but maybe just a game mechanic thing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>The two greatest points of balance that I feel need to be adressed as a high level monk are damage output and "evade" ability.  Both, while already present in some fashion are not up to the standard that I feel they need to be.<P>Regarding damage output, while monks still stay ahead in terms of weapon ratios (Bo Staff of Trorsmang: 40/35 2hb -Veeshan's Peak drop-, Tranquil Staff: 29/30 fx: 120 dmg-stun 2hb, Celestial Fists: 9/18 h2h), warriors and rouges (without backstab) can get very close with weapons of equal or less difficulty to obtain (Willsapper: 13/20 piercing, Exquisite Velium Warsword: 12/21 1hs, Exquisite Velium Brawlstick: 32/36 2hb).<P>The best way to resolve this issue is to simply give Flying Kick a minimum damage by level.  Why is that?  It allows for an across the board increase in damage regardless of what weapon combination you go with (h2h, 1hb, 2hb).<P>The monk's need for an enhanced "evade" type ability is the issue that definetly needs looking at.  Unlike other damage dealers, monks do not have a way of directly lowering themselves off the hate list.  With feign death, a monk forces the mob onto another person, but it does not lower them on the hate list (others have to build their agro higher than the monk).  While rogues can use evade to reduce their agro fairly quickly (step back, evade, re-engage), monks have to sit fd'ed and wait for people to rebuild agro around them before they may re-engage, thus lowering their overall effectiveness in large-scale encounters.<P>A few examples with a monk, rogue, and warrior:<P>The warrior has already established agro and the monk and rogue are just coming in...<P>Round 1-<BR>Warrior 1200<BR>Monk 0<BR>Rogue 0<P>Rogue lands a huge backstab.  Coupled with his melee, that bumps himself up the list past the warrior.  The monk is slowly working his way up the agro ladder due to his higher damage output than the warrior.<P>Round 2- <BR>Rogue 1700<BR>Warrior 1600<BR>Monk 700<P>Rogue steps out and evades, reducing his hate to a number lower than the warriors and possibly lower than the monks.  Monk keep batting away and <BR>is catching up to the warrior.<P>Round 3-<BR>Warrior 2000<BR>Monk 1400<BR>Rogue 700* Out of fight<P>Rogue with lowered hate comes back in.  The rogue has essentially lost 1 round of combat for ducking out.<P>Round 4-<BR>Warrior 2400<BR>Monk 2100<BR>Rogue 900<P>Later in the fight, the monk has gotten ahead of the warrior and needs to fd.<P>Round 412097-<BR>Monk 3000 *fd'ed, out of fight<BR>Warrior 2000<P>Because the monk fd'ed, the agro is shifted to the warrior.  However, becaues fd does not lower the monk on the hate list directly, the monk has to sit and wait for the warrior to catch up.<P>Round 412098-<BR>Monk 3000 *fd'ed, out of fight<BR>Warrior 2400<P>Round 412099-<BR>Monk 3000 *fd'ed, out of fight<BR>Warrior 2800<P>After 3 rounds of no damage output.  The monk can stand back up and start attacking.<P>Round 412100-<BR>Warrior 3200<BR>Monk 3000<P>However, look what happens if the monk starts attacking again off the bat:<P>Round 412101-<BR>Monk 3700 *fd'ed, out of fight<BR>Warrior 3600<P>The monk got ahead of the warrior again and needed to feign.  In order to avoid this, the monk would need to stay out of the fight not only to let the warrior get ahead in hate rating, but also SIGNIFICANTLY ahead so the monk continue a stream of attacks unmolested.  The monk needs some sort of hate reducing factor so he/she doesn't have to make him/herself ineffective by being down a good deal of the fight.<P>The easiest way to accomplish this is by giving feign death an evade-style hate reduction component.  By doing this, feign death can be used more effectively in a fight as a means of avoiding agro, as it was meant to be.<P>Everything else that isn't bug related - chain attacks, stuns, improved/new disciplines - are just, frankly, just bones.  Several things are worth heavily considering in terms of asthetics (spreading out the weight reduction, monk looks), but the only main problems I see with monks in terms of balance are the two things listed above.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Conclusion:<P>-Giving monks triple attack with skill 100.<BR>-Making FD have some of the evade effect on targeted mob.<P>Reasons:<BR>Pre kunark, after the rogues got fixed, monks were doing damage somewhere between warriors and rogues, with an AC not too far below that of a warrior in superb gear. After some of the new kunark and velious weapons, (example, the best a monk or warrior can get at lvl 55 is jaded maces.. and with those, both classes will suddenly do the same damage, that leaves the monk.. out of buisness) with a skill in triple attack, monks would be able to do around 25% more damage than warriors, given the same weapons, and that part would seem fixed again.<P>As it stands now, if a monk aggros too mutch, he dies, feign dead is currently broken, so if someone is hitting a mob, it will see past your feign, and still hit you, and without the enormous AC upgrades the other tank classes have gotten to their ac/hp, monks goes down very fast.<P>So, without some way of reducing aggro, giving more damage wont change anything past lvl 50 (pre 50 monks are fine), this could be solved by giving an evade like skill.<P>Stuns and whatsnot that has been up would suddenly give monks new abilities, what most monks wants as far as i can tell is their old role back, as one of the damage giving classes, not second rate warriors, with the only advantage of pulling better with feign.<P><BR>-Painbringer, lvl 50 cleric, 49 monk, 48 shaman, 40 mage, 39 necro, and countless lower chars.<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Aoeldyn, not only will giving monks half of this not overbalance monks, giving monks TWICE as much as this probably will not overbalance the monk, given the recent balancing ("improvements") that have been made to the other classes.  First with how all fighting classes but monk received drastic improvement with the release of Kunark (and its improved weaponry and the class changes 51-60) and then Velious with how Velious mobs handle FD (FD is broken in Velious).<P>Anyway the most important thing to me on the list is the ability to STUN.  This is very very important for the monk; every other fighting class has a much better chance to stun (and thus interrupt casters) than monks are.  From a PvE perspective, the ability to solo as a melee is one of the, if not THE, most gratifying things about choosing monk (instead of insane dmg dealing rogue or meatshield coolest toy getting warrior) and yet, BOTH of those classes do MUCH better interrupting casters.  This is broken and monks need knockback or stun effects on FK (their final special is FK), and ability to stun/knockback with their regular attack or other low lvl specials.  <P>Incidentally this change if done in a powerful enough fashion will also bring monk up from the currently placed BOTTOM of the melee pvp class list (because of their inability to wear any heavy armor their resists (MR,DR,FR,CR,PR) SUCK relative to all other melees, combine this with their almost total inability to effectively stun/interrupt casters makes them CASTER FODDER in pvp; warriors for example get both bash(stun/interrupt) and many huge dm weapons that interrupt (either from the proc or just from the sheer damage), plus ability to wear extremely high resist armor, PLUS the hps to absorb the spells that get through even if they DIDN'T have the resist gear-stun/interrupt skills too!!)<P>Any give monks much improved ability to interrupt casters through stun and you will fix a very broken part of the game, and give us more low low weight but high resist gear too, make it hard to get I don't care, some of us will cross the ends of Norrath for this stuff so we can stand a fighting chance vs the naked ganks and other casters. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, here is my take.  Yippe yip, most of you claim monks are the "masters" of hand to hand...  it seems to me like you guys dont want to work to make the money to get the decent weapons, and therefor complain about having h2h damage being better.  get a good weapon and i bet you will immediately stop complaining, 'nuff said.<P>Second, the feign death issue.  Now, when something fakes its death, you believe its dead =P so if the enemy believes your dead, when you unfeign why should it come back =P  if you look like your dead, why should the mob come running across half the bloody zone to come get you? <P>Thats my take.<P>Kestrel</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>About fixing some of the monk quests:<P>1) Treant Fists: I will refrain from detailing the extreme work reqd to get these, it's now been discussed in posts about 300 times probably. So give Treant fists a reward much more commensurate with the often 100+ RL hours needed to get them. I suggest the following changes: <P>a) reduce weight from .7 to zero or .1 (.7 believe it or not is very heavy for a monk who has to stay at 14 or less or lose AC; try to put gear on and stay at 14, much less carry food/water/bandages or anything else at all, not even counting the weapons we get which are all overweight)<P>b) place one of the following two effects on them, or both effects: Serpent Sight, and/or Summon Bandages.  Serpent sight allows us to blind humans to finally see (at least when not on corpse run) and summon bandages will save us an extra trip to the store every now and then, a fitting reward for an extremely long (100+ hour) and difficult at mid level quest.<BR>Whether or not you place serpent sight on them please upgrade the Shiverback armor (planes armor) from its current status; no monk is pleased with it; one guy said if you give Treant Fists serpent sight it takes away the tiny benefit shiverback gives over treant fists (shiverback sucks); this is wrong, upgrading shiverback and making treant fists worthwhile, though, seems the right thing to do. <P>c) Give it higher AC (say, 12AC-same as the super easy to obtain Iksar Scaled Gloves) and better stats, say 7DEX or AGI or something.<P>d) Change the graphics to the "wrapped fists" look, but keeping the same crimson color it has now; this would give these a nice unique look.<P>Other quests: give us more quests!! There aren't enough monk quests.  We need quests that reward us with high resist armor, monks are sorely lacking in resist gear vs the other melees since we can not wear the heavy stuff, meanwhile rogues, warriors, pallys, sks, even bards get to use such things as the runed bone fork (10SVFire, 10 SVCOLD, 10 SVMAGIC) in range slot, the bloodstained mantle (good AC 10 SVMAGIC shoulder slot, costs about 30 plat !!) and tons of other high resist things that monk can't equip.  Arguably monks need high resist gear even more than the other melees since one of the huge appeals of the monk class is the possibility of soloing as a melee (well low blues and greens anyway, that still is a blast); as it stands their resist gear choices are very very slim, much LESS than all other melees.  In pvp, this places monks near the bottom of the list, go surf the pvp server message boards, monks are usually never mentioned as effective in pvp, and are often on the lists of the most broken classes-to give them a fighting chance vs casting mobs and players, PLEASE give them more resist gear. And give them the ability to be adept at stunning, they are masters of the body they should be adept at stunning their opponent. These two changes will make monks once more able to at least hold their own a little better in pvp AND make them more viable for one of their main draws as a class, the ability to solo(all the other melees can stun, monks should be able to stun and stun slightly better than other melees due to their monkish mastery) <P>Finally fix the monk quests that ARE out there, for example change weight of Collar of Nikesha from 1.5, to zero or .1  (This is a quest for a neck piece, neckslot items in EQ are usually less than .5 and here's a MONK ONLY one, the class of all classes that needs no weight/low weight armor, and it weighs over 3 times the norm for a neck piece-this is bonkers!)  Add alot more Velious monk quests with low weight rewards, give us a reason to venture to a land in which our main skill (FD) is hopelessly broken ( and fix that too please, heh.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The stun should do no more than iterupt casters. Maybe 1/10th of a second.<P>Our offhand should at all times have the same damage tables as our main hand.<P>Strike/kick specials should be unhooked from each other. Thunderkick should be a native ability from flying kick like a crippling blow but can happen at any health level.<P>Each of our special attacks should get an added benifit at various levels. Perhaps a slightly longer stun/proc could be added to strikes for example.<P>All of our equipment should be seriously evaluated for weight and AC. Treant fists should be usable by iksars and they should have a definate benifit for the length of the quest. (117 hours for me).<P>The Collar of Neshika should aslo be looked at for its weight and benifits for a Monk.<P>They should reevaluate the regen abilities of monks. Getting a bonus to regen while fd etc at the highest levels is pretty useless compared to an overall increase in regen over the entire course of a monks career. This would be the same rate whetehr sitting, standing, or fd.<P>We should get increased vision skills such that at lev 20 we get infravision, 40 we get ultravision, and 55 we get see invis nativly.<P>Our running speed should naturally increase as we level from normal at level 1 to SoW at 60.<P>Our natural AC should be reavaluated compared to the armor usable by other mellee classes.<P>Gillead De'Paten<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I like the minimum damage idea.  I also like think the celestial fists need to override buffs maybe that would work.  And I agree at 60 fists should be a monks best weapons.  I think alot of the monk armor/ weapon items wt those that are around 2lb and over should be reduced so that we can use them.  Definantly more diversity in appearance I'm sorry the armor looks great but it gets old after awhile.  Planar armor Stats on all planar armor need severe help our armor in planes stacks up to that of crafted or other quest armors of the other classes.  That should not be the case.  I think also the other attacks previous levels should still be utilized in later levels.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Thanks for your work Alan.<P>There are TWO main issues that must be worked on. There is a THIRD issue that would be nice if it was addressed as well.<P>ONE: Please fix Feign Death. You've read enough examples of why it's broken (resisted spells, Velious monsters not seeing it, under two bubbles of health, can't move...). This is the number one concern I have since this ability more than anything defines my class.<P>TWO: Increase our damage post 50. Minimums on Flying Kick and Thunder Kick will help, but not by enough. Add increased damage bonus to the off hand when no weapons are wielded to minimum kick damage and you'll be close. The first two items on your list (Unhooking Feet and Fists & Chain Attacks) a. seems silly to me, b. wouldn't really help that much, c. would probably be a waste of programmer resources that I would rather see used elsewhere. <P>THREE: Items. I would rather you leave Monk items out of the equation when trying to balance Monks compared to others. The reason for this is because if items ARE part of the equation then you only help balance those people who have those items and the rest of the Monks remain left out. Having sid that:<P>* Shiverback - please make Monks want to wear this instead of destroy it. Upping the AC or stats of Shiverback will not do anything for balance but it will put this armor at the same level as other class armor.<P>* Celestial Tranquility - allow this to stack. You seem to have a good understanding of this issue. The AC and ATK enhancements should still stack even if we have a pure speed buff on us, and likewise with the other attributes.<P>* Celestial Fists - should be closer to 15/24. When a Monk is able to earn their status as a member of the Celestial Brotherhood, their fists are already 14 dmg weapons. Why must they step backwards? I realize the overall damage is greater with the CF, but with damage as low as 9, it's like we're slapping things to death.<P>Keep up the good work and keep listening to our good ideas. I know you have a lot on your plate right now so please focus on the TWO key points that the majority of us Monks are asking for:<P>1. Fix Feign Death<BR>2. Increase Monk Damage Post 50<P>Thanks!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The only comment I have about the things that absor mentioned is that I'm not sure how important unhooking the special attacks from eachother or allowing chains are.  I mean, it sounds cool, but I don't know that it will add a significant amount of damage, and it seems like it would add a decent amount of taunt.  If it would add a significant amount of damage without increasing taunt dramaticly, it does sound like an interesting idea (as watching battle spam is fun...especially different types of attacks...punch+crush+kick+strike sounds like it will be ammusing, at least)<P>As far as other peoples comments:<P>Yes, I agree that fd needs to be looked at.<P>No, I don't agree that fists should be better than ALL weapons.  Monks should have the ability to increase their damage output over just their fists.  If fists are better than ALL weapons, it will render monk melee boring (remember the days when ALL 50 warriors had 2 yaks?  Now that there are monk weapons, they should have a use).<P>Yes, I agree that if an offhand bonus is given for monks, the 2hb bonus should probably be increased.  Verant should increase damage across the entire board for monks, not just for the monks who chose to use 1hb/HTH.<P>Someone commented that they were against an offhand bonus because they were in support of monks just using their fists, but YOUR SECOND FIST IS STILL YOUR OFFHAND AND ITS DAMAGE IS DIFFERENT FROM YOUR OTHER FIST BECAUSE OF IT.  Please, you help nobody by oposing a beneficial change because you think it won't affect you (even though it would).<P>Yoso<BR>50 Iksar Monk<BR>Saryrn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Besides the FD fix, there's only two things I've been looking for as a monk.<P>1) The ability to do significantly more damage than warriors. <P>2) The AC to live long enough to do that damage. I focus intensively on AC when it comes to gear selection, but monk equipment is so shaddy that I get more hit points than I do AC from my entire suit. The alteration of Silver Moon and Shiverback into something other than bank bait would help this, as would the introduction of a Kunark armor set comparable to the other melee class armors there. <P>On your list, I see a grand total of one item that addresses these concerns: the proposal to make the melee damage bonus apply to both hands for a monk. <P>Remember, damage is the ONLY thing a monk brings to a high level group. We need to have the tools to deal it out, which involves superior weapons to any other melee class (without ridiculous weights... you don't see warriors paying a penalty for high AC armor, why should monks pay a weight penalty for high damage sticks?) and armor that allows a monk to have a competitive AC with their warrior brethren.<P>This will not infringe on a warrior's position as tank extraordinaire: a monk lacks the controllable taunt ability, the hit points, and the useful defensive disciplines that a warrior has. What it DOES do is make it a CHOICE between a warrior and a monk, rather than relegating the monk to a second rate melee, useful if there's no warrior available.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think that one important way of increasing monk damage has been sadly left off the list.  Critical Attacks, Crippling Blows, Deadly Strikes on unarmed attacks would not only raise our damage substantially, but would reduce the need to arm all monks with heavy expensive weapons to keep up with the warriors in damage.  I've seen a warrior 4 levels lower than me with an 8 damage weapon in offhand, 5 damage in primary, crit for 50, 39, and 60 in a combat, whereas my most powerful blow with my 14 damage weapon is 33, averaging 22.<P>Even with my twinked weapons, the untwinked warrior 4 levels below me outdamages me half the time.  It is my understanding that monks were supposed to be the masters of melee, dealing out massive amounts of damage with their fists, only outdamaged by rogues backstabbing.  In practice, i find that this is not the case.  I find that i have fewer hitpoints and less ac than a warrior of my level, and i deal less damage.<P>Monks need to get back to their roots and begin using their bare hands again.  Adding critical attacks to their unarmed combat seems to make perfect sense to me.  Monks are highly skilled un using their fists as weapons, why shouldn't they command the same kind of skill in occasionally landing a critial blow as a warrior does with his weapons?  I know I would sell my twinked weapons in a heartbeat if i started critical attacking with my fists.  I think many other monks would agree.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Um FD needs the frenzy code fixed as you stated, our dm output REALLY needs increases...your new weight idea looks GREAT Absor, just a tad bit more work, probably more AC is needed on the bonus portion, or make it armor AC as opposed to flat out 100+ ac for a guy under 5 weight.  Here's what I mean:<P>At 30, I put on my Azure Sleeves, 12 AC.  Because I'm a monk they aren't really 12...something more along the lines of 24-25 AC (not sure exactly).<P><BR>Also, a neat little thin you could throw in would be deity quests...As an iksar monk, my only choice of deity was Cazic-Thule; however I'd personally like the idea of going to Kael or something, meeting with some cleric of Zek, showing my loyalty and switching my deity over to Rallos Zek-based...in turn receiving the faction changes that this implies.<P>The same thing could work with a lot of NPCs currently in-game.  Such as Brother Estle in west Karana being turned into a missionary for the Prime Healer, or any cleric/shaman religious guy in any of the cities across Norrath.  This would of course be a change that affects everyone, not just monks. =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>It is truly refreshing to see that we do indeed have a list and that it will be getting reviewed thoroughly for any viable changes to the monk class.<P>One thing I would suggest is that you look at making any newfound abilities, such as stun or even the natural armor class progression, quest oriented. It makes far too much sense that a monk would seek out knowledge or skills that would make him, well, a better monk. It would be a logical way to insert these abilities into the world and would also provide a quest that actually resulted in something usable.<P>Please keep up the good work my friend.<P>/bow<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I currently play a lvl 25 monk on Teris Thule. My reason for choosing the monk is the unarmed martial arts aspect. I'm hoping that I can carry my plans of a pure empty handed combatant throughout the full carreer of my character. After reading several postings and much of the experience I've had so far, I'm starting to feel that I don't want my monk to get above lvl 30 because of all the unnecessary limitations. I have seen many of these equipment dependant monks and I do not want to have to resort to those means to be able to be a viable participant in a group. If VI is going to keep monks as undesirables in grouping situations, then VI better do something to make the monk an unparalleled force in soloing.<P>On the martial arts aspect...<P>Monks should have hitpoints and I mean alot of them. They train their bones, ligaments, muscles, respiratory, and cardio vascular systems for endurance. Thus they can take more punishment. Hence the escalating fatigue bar much like the mana bars for casters. You'll come to that farther down this post.<P>Monks should have an escalating AC bonus due to their training to be able to "roll with the punches". I figured this would be an apt description here since, from my understanding, damage taken is based on one's AC.<P>Monks should do more damage in hand to hand. After all, they are trained in methods of punching and kicking to get the most efficiency from their bodies.<P>Monks should be able to stun. They are trained to strike weak points.<P>Monks should be doing critical hits. Once again we come to the point of being trained to take advantage of an opponents weakness.<P>Monks should be doing crippling strikes at higher levels once again because of their intensive training on where the weak points are and how to strike them.<P>Monks should have triple, at lvl 20, and quadruple, at lvl 40, attacks. Compare the striking rate of a master martial artist to that of a swordsman wielding a hand and a half sword. This shouldn't be a problem considering that, as far as I've seen, EQ doesn't take reach into consideration in melee combat.<P>Monks should have crits on throwing. Trained for accuracy in darts, shuriken, knives, spikes, and even spears. But don't give the throw crits unless you give the hnd to hnd crits too. That would just be dumb in my opinion.<P>Monks spend years, or even lifetimes, honing their bodies and atuning themselves to their inner natures thus, monks should have high resistances at least to elemantal and natural based attacks, magical and otherwise.<P>Slash and Pierce skills.  Monks train in a variety of weapons including several types of knives, forks(sai, jite/jute, etc),swords, axes, pole arms, and spears of both the one and two handed nature.  It puzzles me why this wasn't thought of in the game.<P>Defensive skills...<P>Monks have a good start with dodge, block, and ripost.<P>How about adding iron skin/shirt where the monk has a chance of reducing the damage to mabey 20% if not negating the hit all together.<P>There's also a technique called Maka Wara where the monk hardens his arms and legs to possibly damage to an opponent while blocking. It could function like an intermitant damage shield in game.<P>There are also reversals where an opponent would make an attack on the monk and have that attack redirected to damage themselves. I've seen it done, done it, and have had it done to me.<P>There are even monks who have trained their senses to such a degree as to be aware of someone's location and movements even though the monk can not see the other.  Translate this to having a chance of seeing the invisible in game.<P>Monkly Magic...<P>If one must go there, then consider the possibility of special abilities that affect the fatigue bar. Of course this means that there's a possibility that a monks fatigue bar would increase like the mana bar for casters.<P>Lasting Breath. Once the air bar runs out, the fatigue bar starts to reduce. After the fatigue bar is depleted, then the monk would start drowning. Say 30 seconds per base bubble.<P>Feet of Wind. Like SoW. The level of the skill would be the percentage of the speed of SoW. How long it last depends on the drainage rate of the fatigue bar. At least a minute per base bubble.<P>Grasshopper. Jumping where the level of the jump skill would determine the safe height of the jump and landing. This does not need to be based on Safe Fall as the monk has to prepare for the jump and expend fatigue. Suggestion of 1.25 base bubbles per jump.<P>Healing. The monk expends qi (fatigue) to heal self or others. Percentage of damage healed equal to the monks level. Succeed or fail, entire fatigue bar is depleted.<P>Drifting Smoke. The monk expends qi (fatigue) like breath is normally expended while swimming underwater to gain the ability to move through small openings from one room or passage to an adjacent room or passage. Getting caught in a wall when qi runs out would kill the character of course.<P>The list of abilities and how to implement them can go on and on.<P>Feign Death really needs to be fixed. Once you've convinced someting that you're dead, it should completly forget about you. After all, you're dead. You're no longer a threat. And fix the bug that makes it to where FD doesn't work well in a group. I was being chased by 4 Sarnaks on 7/15/2001, I was nowhere near my group and I was outpacing them by a good margin via SoW. I FDed successfully 6 times in a row and the Sarnaks kept comming and were still beating on me if I let them get close enough. This is not good.<P>Most of the things I've mentionsd here are practices and disciplines that are persued in real life by many practitioners of the martial arts. Then there's the monkly magic section which is based loosly on the Chinese wire dance fantasy kung fu movies. LOL<P>Monk gear needs to be light weight. Assuming a stone to be 7 pounds, a really, REALLY, strong wooden staff would not weigh more than 0.8. A pair of gloves that weigh 10 pounds (1.5 stone)? I've worn plate gauntlets (SCAdians know what I mean) and they don't weight that much. Monkly gear weight really needs to be looked at. It needs to be lighter and stronger based on how hard it is to get. Based on that formula, from what I've been hearing, the RotWF alone should be almost impenetrable to anything but a god. Make the item match the quest or the quest match the item.<P>As far as the special attacks go. I agree that the hand strikes should be unlinked from the foot strikes. And a flying kick for an average of 3 points at lvl 60, the gist I'm getting from reading these posts, would really suck the wind from anyone's sails after doing a tail rake/dragon punch for and average of 18 points at lvl 25.<P>Lastly, the changes to the monk class should be made throughout the entire level range so as to benefit all players, not just the post 50/powergamer group.<P>Good luck and good hunting.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Couple of things:<P>a) Celestial Fists need more than just the effect stacking.  That is just a start.  They also need an upgrade in damage.  9/16 just brings me to the top of the hate list, and is very poor compared to weapons you can find dropping on monsters in western wastes/dragon necrop/sleeper's tomb.  I find it sad to see people who have achieved their epic not even use it because the damage is so poor.  Warriors/Rogues etc get 13/20 weps with +5 to all stats/saves and +50 hps...makes our fists look pathetic.  I understand that monks can use the 1hb's and 2hb's that are dropping, but the point is, if i've achieved my epic, i shouldn't HAVE to go farm weapons.  <P>2) /agree with all on FD.  It needs to be fixed.  I basically don't use it anymore except for feigning stuff off me when im running between zones.  Its useless in a raid/group situation, because nothing believes feign anymore.  Me feigning = me getting beat on more by mob.<P>3) Black Pantherskin armor.  People have mentioned the weight factor, and yes it is too high.  What people have failed to mention is how poor the armor is.  Look at Rogue armor compared to ours.  Ignoring AC for the moment and just looking at stats, Our tunic is 10str/dex/sta, theirs is 14str 10dex 10sta 20agi 5 to all saves.  Umm..is it just me or is that ludicrously unbalanced?  Our bracer is 3str 3CHA??? 10 hps, haze pantherskin is 5str 4sta 8agi.  Black Pantherskin Shoulderpads 4str 6dex, hazepanther skin shoulderpads 7str 10dex.  Our gloves 7str 7agi, their gloves 8str 10dex 10sta.  They get better stats on every piece.  With only 7 of their pieces found, compared to 11 monk pieces, they outdo us in EVERY stat but hps, and by a significant margin.  Why is their armor so incredibly superior to ours?<P>4) I agree with the poster who gave the fist progression that led to 15/26 at 50, 16/25 at 55 and 17/24 at 60.  Our fists are very underpowered, and even 16/26 at 60 is underpowered.  No monk would use his fists at 60 with them being 16/26 weapons for two reasons: A) there are way too many weapons that are far superior, and b) They'd have to unequip their epic.  If you make fists 16/26 at 60 like you suggest in your post Absor, then Celestial Fist must significantly upgrade fists beyond that, 9/16 just doesn't cut it.  I like the 15/24 that one monk posted, but that still pales in comparison to droppable weapons.  15/22 would be more comprable, and would give me an excuse to use my fists, though i'll still use priceless and primal velium.<P>4) Overall damage:  Unhooking punches and kicks is fine, but that really doesn't increase our damage much.  Dragon punch does a maximum of what, 25 damage or so?  Absor's post mentions giving monks checks for multiple specials to occur, ie if a flying kick lands, give a chance to hit a dragon punch, and if that lands, a chance to hit an eagle strike, etc, saying "this would be a fun way to increase monk damage".  Yet again, this wouldn't really increase my damage.  It would just make me "look cool".  Most of the high level monks aren't playing to "look cool" when they are fighting a mob with 250k hps.  Damage increases needs to be substative and actually increase damage.  Adding a minimum damage to flying kick would be nice.  At LEAST a min of current_level.  Would also be nice if it hit once in a while.  I shouldn't miss with my flying kicks nearly 50% of the time against blue monsters.  Thats pretty poor compared to backstab which does many times more damage.  Best flying Kick i've ever had was 131, and i've seen rogues double-backstab for over 900 damage.  <P>Thanks for reading,<BR>Cymorg<BR>53rd Disciple of the Celestial Fists.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ITEM: Feign Death Bugs.<P>DESCRIPTION: [snip] There is also a claim that feign death is less effective if the monk is under two bubbles of health. That seems like a bug.<P>------------------------------------<BR>Absor, I was the one who first posted about this in the origional "monk talk" thread and I have some more information for you.<P>from Cey on monkly-business:<BR>"under 2 bubbles really has only one thing to do with feign not working.<P>If you're under 2 bubbles of health a mob is more likely to frenzy on the monk, correct? Well what happens (which is a bug) is that if other people are melee'ing/damaging a mob when you try to feign, you will never be successful if you are in melee range of said mob. If you leave the mob's melee range to feign you will find that unless you get the fail message or are being cast upon, your fd will be successful. The reason people seem to think it has something to do with your health (getting back to the whole frenzy/two bubbles thing) is because when you're low on health mobs frenzy on you, therefor making it nearly impossible to leave melee range in a closed area. When you get to higher levels, mobs summon you back to them the minute you leave their melee range, thus making it even harder to feign. This makes feign death a totally useless life saving technique in battle...and it really doesn't have anything to do with having low health except for the frenzying factor"<P>Thinking about it, I belive this to be a more accurate description of the group fd bug.  The same, or similar bug may exist when your soloing but it doesnt seem to happen nearly as often.<P>I just want to make sure that the dev team doesnt roll a monk, give him 1 bubble of health, engage a moss snake, feign, and say "yup, feign works fine".<P>I believe you will get the best results testing it like this:<P>1) monk is grouped with at least 1 more melee character<BR>2) the group is engaged with a mob.<BR>3) melee characters are in melee range of the mob<BR>4) monk feigns in melee range of the mob.<P>The feign should not be successfull (internally, Im not sure what happens, a mask is set to ignore the monk on the hate list but not removed? either or, the mechanics of a fd dont happen). If a monk is the highest on the hate list, they will continue to get pounded on.<P>thanks<BR>-lotek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok... here's my spiel as a warrior and a monk owner :-).<P>FD needs to be fixed<BR>Damage needs to be enhanced for monks<BR>Overhaul has to be done to taunt<P>FD we all know about. Although I agree with the statement that FD was never meant to split mobs, I think it would be extremely beneficial if more groups could get by without REQUIRING an enchanter in every situation. Splitting mobs is a time consuming and dangerous occupation, so keep it in. Now, I do agree that SOME... a very special few NPCS who are meant to be guards to named mobs should not be fooled by FD.<P>Damage and taunt go hand in hand. Personally, I don't think monks fists should do the most damage. I think they should do equivilent to the average warrior with average weapons. If the monk needs to  do more damage, then go get some fancy gloves, guantlets, 1h blunt weapons, etc. Make some guantlets or gloves that use hand to hand skill and have great stats. Put some interesting procs on them (hell, anything can be less unbalancing than hundred blows).<P>As for taunting... figure out how much more damage a monk should do to a warrior, then modify their hate list by an equivilent percentile. Either that or make warriors taunts stack rather then simply put them to the top of the list + 1.<P>All specials, not just the monks, should be SPECIAL. They really don't add much damage wise, so give us a bone and make them eye candy for everyone. Warrior crits and cripples should do more damage then the maximum for a weapon in all situations. Flying kick at high levels should always do close to max damage.

</FONT><HR>This was taken out of the list you posted absor<P><BR>************There is also a claim that feign death is less effective if the monk is under two bubbles of health. That seems like a bug.*************<P>I guess people have already commented on it just like I've been commenting on it for a long time now.<P>People don't understand the way feign works...most monks don't feign in battle if they're not low on health so they only notice this bug when they're 2 bubbles or under.<P>Now I'm not going to get into other glitches with feign death (failure due to client or server lagging etc), I'm just gonna explain part of this one.  Please read, and I'll try to elaborate.  I apologize if this has already been addressed with the same explanation.<P>How feign works:  We'll name the monk in question 'Wu.'<P>Wu is a monk.  He has the feign death skill.  Wu is soloing at level 20.  He's in oasis and takes on a deepwater crocodile that's level 19.  Poor Wu can't seem to solo the croc, so he must feign.  As he is the only one who has engaged the croc, he simply turns off attack and feigns death.  Wu is a good monk and has maxed his feign death skill, and as luck would have it he doesn't get the failure message.  The croc stops attacking him and walks away even though wu has half a bubble health left.<P>Now let's pretend wu has gained some levels.  He's in solb fighting fire giants.  Wu is attacking a fire giant warrior in a group.  Unfortunately the cleric is oom and Wu is getting beat on.  What is he to do????  Well, Wu is a smart monk so he decides to turn off attack and feign death (or just make a hotkey to do both).  Wu gets no message but the FG continues to beat on him, eventually leading to death.  Wu thinks that maybe he was just unlucky so he gets his reviviscence (he's grouped with a cleric who has a ress stick, aka limp noodle) and continues fighting his way through the fire giants.  Well whadda ya know?  a couple fg's later he is again in a situation where the cleric has run out of mana and Wu is near death.  The fg won't stop attacking him so he feigns death.  Again, he doesn't get a message and again the fg starts to pound on him.  Again, poor Wu dies.<P>So Wu becomes curious and starts to do a little research.  A while later, after new raids and experiences, he notices a trend.  He remembers the time at the fire giants and notices that there was a warrior and rogue in his group.  He notices that in all the times feign death has failed there has been someone else melee'ing the mob of choice.  This leads Wu to believe that whenever someone else has enganged a certain mob in close combat, he cannot successfully feign this mob off.  for some reason the mob will see through feign every time.  Wu is almost correct.<P>Even more time goes by and after trying many things, Wu learns that he can successfully feign these creatures off if he leaves their melee range before trying to feign.  Why this works he doesn't know.  He does, however, realize that when he becomes low on health, many mobs will attack him and try to finish him off, even if he is no longer attacking said creature and other melee'ers are taunting/smacking it around trying to save Wu's life.  This action is known as a mob 'frenzying' on a player...this is when a mob will ignore other players and go after a party member of low health.  Some mobs will even leave their current target to finish said player off.  The only way to get a mob to stop frenzying, is if a) said player is healed b) said player dies c) said mob(s) are killed.<P>This being the case, it is very hard to leave the melee range of a mob that is frenzied on you.  Doing the math, Wu realizes that if such a thing happens to him, and he cannot leave a mob's melee range, he can't feign death successfully.  Wu then takes this a step further and thinks about the level 51+ mobs that he fights.  They will summon him back to them the moment that he leaves melee range, making it nearly impossible to feign successfully at all.<P>so that's my story of Wu.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>to elaborate, here's what I'm getting at:  when a monk tries to feign a creature off, there can't be anyone melee'ing it or feign will fail unless the monk is outside of the mob's melee range.  This can be nearly impossible and makes no sense.<P>I have no clue why people attribute feign failing to having low health.  My only speculation would be that they've been "frenzied" on (and I don't know what's so hard to understand about that word.  Half the people over on monkly-business had no idea what I was talking about with it), and have been unable to get far enough away from the mob to feign.  The natural reaction is to back away and then feign.  When you can't get far enough away from a mob to leave its melee range because it's frenzied on you, feign will fail.  And of course, some mobs will frenzy on you when you're low on health (not all do), rough estimate seems to be under 2 bubbles health.  Thus the notable increase in feign failing at low health.<P>Now I don't even know how to get into feign failing on rooted mobs that summon and other stuff.  If you (Absor) have any questions feel free to ask.  This has been my main issue all along and I'm glad that it was somehow brought to light...even if it was totally misunderstood.<P>Anyway, I love the ideas of the offhand acting like the primary hand, and that of natural ac bonus being re-evaluated.  Thanks for lookin into all this.  Even seeing that you've acknowledged these things is so good to see  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>So yeah, it's late and I hope this makes sense.

</FONT><HR>oh hah, someone used a snipit of something I said on another board.<P>that's right Cey, read the thread first before you post.  /bonk me.<P>Sorry all...but I do believe my last post was a better representation of what I've been trying to say.<P>Oh, and as a clarification.  I'm aware that sometimes when you solo a mob will see through feign death.  My 'soloing' example in last post was just to show that failing has nothing to do with low health.  I have no explanation for feign failing when solo at all though.  sowwy =(</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
