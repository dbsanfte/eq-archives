</FONT><HR>Hey all,<P>I've noticed recently that the F8 key doesn't seem to work very well anymore.  I have had times when I have to hit the F8 key about 10 times before it targets the mob.  I've had times where I can press it 20 times and it never targets anything, even when the mob is standing right in front of me attacking my party.  I don't remember having a problem with this before but recently it is extremely bad to the point where it's a major hinderance because if F8 doesn't work, then I have to try to CLICK on the mob....  Which brings up Part 2.<P>What's up with the Click interfance of this game.  I can click on a mob on my screen and have it target something next to me.  There are tons of times where there is a corpse on the ground (out of my vision) and I click on a mob in front of me and it targets the corpse!?!?  Also when trying to loot a corpse and my pet is standing next to it, I right click on the corpse and I see that my pet is Amiable to me.  I am NOT clicking on my pet, no where near him, but he's what gets targetted.  It is really not working well and should be changed.  The other part of the Clicking is in the trade and inventory windows, the interface is set to 'pick up' an item when you RELEASE the mouse button instead of when you CLICK the button.  This means that if I am trying to move things around really fast, half the time it picks up the wrong things because I Click the mouse when I'm on the item I want but I move the mouse before I have let go of the button.  This is also very annoying.  <P>Since F8 doesn't work well, and clicking doesn't either, that means I have to try to ASSIST.<P>Assist should realy be changed.  It doesn't always work.  Assist should allow you to assist someone as soon as they have started attacking something.  As soon as someone casts a spell on a mob to pull it and that mob goes aggr to the player, the player should be assistable.  It currently seems that I can only assist if the player has auto attack on and is melee with the mob.  This is useless in trying to target the mob your puller just pulled before it gets to you and starts hacking away at him.<P>Please have someone take a look at these things and make whatever changes are necessary.<P>Thanks,<BR>--Kel</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

And not just the closest mob, sometimes i have to target 4 different mobs for mezzing while the rest of the group beats number 5 to a bloody pulp.<BR>Yes there are some peoblems with targeting, and yes it is annoying at times.

</FONT><HR>Yep I experienced this too. When in a good group I use f8 while the fighter is being beat into pulp, mez the closest thing, the fighter backs off a little, I press f8 and mez again and so on, until all but one are mezzed. But often F8 doesnt work and our fighter just gets beaten to pulp while I try to move and move to be able to click on the traget and actually get it selected. If Im too slow with this the party just dies. Also it would be handy when we would have some kind of cycle list. For example you press the 'erase target list' button, click mob1, then mob2 then mob3. Then press the mez button, then the 'cycle in target list, then mez again etc. This will make sure you can always select the mobs well even if they are standing practically in the same spot. Maybe a 'next closest thing' select button would be handy for those cases too  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>BHehe - comments such as "Voila! Wasted manna... more downtime.. more money for Verant!" don't help us get legitimate problems fixed. Verant doesn't make extra money when you're medding - they still make $10 a month. Bandwidth is the same because they have to update mob locations whether you can see them or not. Verant only makes money when we are happy enough with the game to give them $10 a month.<P>I hate it when someone supports a cause I care about with irrelevant, poorly conceived arguments because their idiocy taints me by association. Kelemvor33 brought up my single biggest complaint with the game in a way that MAY get it addressed, then you have to start spouting conspiracy theories.<P>Absor: Please ignore the troll posts and respond to this issue. As a tank, I often have trouble taunting MOBs off my casters because of this problem. This is the single biggest playability issue in the whole game for me.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As a monk this becomes a real problem…especially with the assist key problem.<BR>I like to drag the mobs into camp, let the tank drag one of to get pounded, and let the chanter mez the rest. The faster the mez the less healing I need.<P>HOWEVER, those that are asking for a cycling f8 key, somebody at Varant responded to that a while ago. From what I remember it was an issue of having to load the position of every mob into a buffer, and then constantly update position for every pc vs every npc in the area, and keeping that in a buffer too. That kind of algorithm could make a Cray explode with enough people and mobs in the same area. That’s a whole lot of calculating going on…could (don’t know, just guessing) cause major lag due to the extra burden on the processors of all the extra computations necessary to fix each mob to each pc, and send that constantly updating information out every time it changes to everybody in the zone. That was the impression I got from what I read, now I may be wrong…I have been before at least once, so don’t be surprised if a similar explanation is given for the reasons it can’t be done. Or maybe somebody from Varant replying, “um…you missed it by a mile, but nice try”* hands the silly monk a cookie*.<P>Smile<BR>Monk 54th belt<BR>Test Server<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree here.  The target nearest NPC button could use some work (should probably describe the buttons in question for remappable functions... it's Q for me!).<P>..As well as clicking.  That's a pretty big problem with the interface.  It's ESPECIALLY bad in 3rd person, which I use 99% of the time.  Not only is the clicking bad, but because of this you click on yourself way too easily.<P>This is because you are in the center of the screen, and you take up much more "clickable" space than your image (the clicking problem).  I've been asking for a way to disable clicking on yourself (the only reason I've ever clicked on myself was to change the inspect message, which means once every 6 months).  I've accidentally clicked on myself and accidentally "looted" myself (changed inspect message) thousands upon thousands of times.  Right-clicking yourself in combat or running near a ledge (or lava) can even cause damage.<P>We have 2 hotkeys to target yourself.  Even if the click interface is fixed, I'd still like to disable clicking on myself, but because it's semi "broken" it makes it twice as hard to target other things.<P>Over 2 years you learn workarounds, but sometimes I have to even jump to first person for a second these days because f8 doesn't work and I can't click on the target sitting in front of me.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
