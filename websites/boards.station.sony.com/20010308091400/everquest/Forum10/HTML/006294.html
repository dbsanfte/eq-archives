</FONT><HR>Couple threads have talked about this lately, some are hidden under other topics.  Tirra mentioned hide-and-seek, and how it unfairly is won by rangers all the time.  (I was witness to a GM event that involved finding someone, but it was before I had tracking, so I didn't bother.  Winner got 100pp)<P>Here is a variation on hide and seek to make it balanced for rangers: (and us Druids over level 20  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> )<P>Drop something that isn't expensive and unlikely that anyone would have in that zone.  Person to return it wins.  Need to have a decent prize to catch the interest of the newbies.  Maybe a basilisc eye stalk hidden in G Fay, for example, with a FS or Tarnished weapon as prize, or a set of patchwork armor.   Don't make it too hard to find, 'cause then it will probably just poof.  Or drop several and have 1st 2nd 3rd prizes based on number returned or first to return.<P>In Misty Thick one night, someone (with SoW) had dropped single plat, gold, silver, and copper coins all over the zone for a treasure hunt.  Man, you should have seen the newbies scramble!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif">  I don't know if it was a GM or just someone generous.  But from the tells after the event, they must have dropped something like 50-100pp.<P>You could probably do that with all the patched leather you would like to give away.  Just sweeten the pot with at least one "Grand Prize" that you can announce.  I'd guess most of the (real) newbies will keep and use what they find - or sell/trade it for something they need.  Make the prize something uninteresting to a twink.  They should be more interested in continuing killing for exp than running around, picking up little bags, looking for that one tanished sword.  <P>Next time I collect six derv rings, I'm going to try this in W FP.<P>Can you drop stuff while invis/camo?  That would sure make it easier to set up the game.  I think you can, because I know you can pick up a dropped item without breaking camo.<P>nikkon</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I was waiting for Tirra to chime in.  Would your hubby monk join too?  <P>We have almost 10 active Xev posters on this board. (based on Nikkon's list subtracting people already in guilds)<P>I know the steps to actually physically create the guild...but is it difficult to really bring a guild a life?  <P>Like Tirra posted the other day, there are always people trying to find 10 people to start a guild.  If you have to beg and bribe to get the first 10, doesn't seem like that bodes well for the future.  <P>Guess Nikkon's posting about give aways got sorta hijacked here.  I still will help with your game this weekend if I am around Nikkon.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wow, did that thread take a left turn somewhere or what?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I think newbies might want derv rings because they don't know any better  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  <BR>But seriously, the quest isn't that good, the market around FP is flooded with them, and they are far from the best thing to put on your fingers.  So the twinks wouldn't be too interested in them, nobody under level 10 would likely already have any, and the newbies would think "cool, I got some magic jewelry".  And the +Dex will help their combat skills increase a tiny bit faster (right?).<P>The sad thing is I just cleaned out my over-full bank account of junk I had collected.  (Junk relative to a level 20, but some of it would have been useful to newbies)  Two or more people cooperating to run a contest would make it go smoother, don't you think?<P>No, I don't think it is difficult to start a guild.  Not relative to the effort it takes to keep one alive, anyway...  <P>I'd be happy to help start one with a charter based on the ideas Tirra mentioned.  <P>The name, as pointed out in the surname thread, is something we have to be able to wear proudly over our heads.  So "Ninja Newbie Twinkers of Norrath" is definately out.  And I'd want the membership to be at least a little selective, for the same reason.<P>It seems that Saturday night would be a good night to try, because of the volume of folks available to recruit for the initial 10 members.  If we had 10 people without having to resort to random recruitment, that would be very cool.  <P>TNT, maybe we should hold off on the derv contest until we see if we've got a guild.  It could be our inaugural event - camping the newbies  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>nikkon</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hey guys, if you decide to create a guild on Xev for TNZ folks, let me know (if you'd like me to join).  I looked for some of you last night and couldn't find anyone, so I spent about an hour and a half helping a newbie learn about basic tailoring, showing him around ec and freeport, and getting him a backpack.  He was so excited when he made 20 pp on a HQ bearskin he looted and was gonna sell to an innkeeper before I stopped him.<P>I really like the idea of a new guild of the TNZ people 'cause although I haven't played with may of you yet, I know from your posts that I would instantly feel comfortable to group with any of you.  I also like the idea of guilding with others who are as interested in helping others as leveling.<P>So, if you're gonna do it, send me an email and I'll see if I can be on when you do it.  My address is halmarden@mcfarlain.com.<P>Thanks,<P>Baraslan<BR>Paladin 15<P>PS My vote for King of the guild is Holyhawk, if he would grace us with his presence.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Tirra,<BR>I visited Seibwen Dekan's web site.  OMG!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/eek.gif"><P>Well yeah!  If we can find someone as skilled in web design and graphics for our guild, it would be great!  I'd love to put "the best of TNZ" that I have been collecting on a site like that, rather than the lame HTML I am capable of.<P>Also, I read their guild charter.  OMG again!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/eek.gif">  I thought a charter was one paragraph that said (in perhaps more eloquent terms) something like "Our guild is for roleplayers from Sony's TNZ that like to group together, and occationally run contests and otherwise help newbies".  I didn't intend to ask you to write anything as beautiful and detailed as what Seibwen Dekan has.  Do we need something like that, or do we start with a more simple statement to please the GM and add details later???<P>Nikkon kneels in humility and reverence before Tirra<P>I had assumed that guild names couldn't be TLA's like "TNZ", but just last night I noticed someone with a TLA guild tag.  TNZ is easier to spell and nice and short.  But Enoz Eibwan has more class.  Guess that is something we vote on.<P>The link to the EQ FAQ for starting a guild seems to be broken.<P>Klegore - I believe TNT was the first to mention starting a guild.  I am just trying to push the ball down the hill...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/redface.gif"><P>I'm really happy to see the offers to start alt's on Xev just to join a TNZ guild  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> That would really help get the guild off the ground without random recruiting.  <P>I'm kinda nervous about putting email addresses on a public BBS.  I guess it is unlikely the address miners for the spammers are watching TNZ, so I will post my "EQ email" address.  Those that don't want to post their addresses public, just send me an email and I'll start a mailing list.<P>Nikkon <BR>nikkonxev@yahoo.com</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Tentative Charter for the new guild follows. Yes, It was lifted heavily from the charter of Siebwen Dekan. Comments are appreciated.<P>--------------<P>We started as a guild on one of the official EverQuest forums known as The Newbie Zone. This forum can be found on the official web site of the on-line multi-player fantasy game, EverQuest, located at www.everquest.com. All guildmembers are strongly urged to read this site at least once a week, and active participation is appreciated. We owe much to our predecessors of Seiban Dekan, and all guildmembers should visit their website once to meet these marvellous people. The official web address of the Seibwen Dekan is http://www.luclin.com/SeibwenDekan. Their web address is case sensitive. Much of this charter is lifted directly from theirs- Thank you Naked Newbie for allowing this.<P>Player and Character<P>It is important to understand the difference between a player of EverQuest and a character of EverQuest. A player of EQ is the real life person who plays the game EverQuest using their own personal computer and Internet connection. A character of EQ is a figment of a player's imagination and is that player's persona and adventurer. There can only be one player, but that one player may have an endless amount of characters.<P>Roleplaying<P>The TNZ/Enoz Eibwen (TNZ/EE) is considered a roleplaying guild. The characters that we play are based on roleplaying. This is a concept where creativity and fantasy come from our minds and our hearts. All player characters who are a part of our guild should have some knowledge of what roleplaying is and how it works within the game EverQuest. From day one, a player is to think of their character's background and life story and then effectively act it out while on-line in the world known as Norrath. When dealing with other player characters (PC) inside and especially outside our guild, it is highly recommended that the player roleplays to the best of his or her own ability with the other PCs. As a whole, we do not roleplay non-stop amongst ourselves. It should be noted that continuous roleplaying on-line can burn a player out. Although roleplaying is a requirement, it is not required every moment you are on-line. But whenever you are interacting with an on-line EQ stranger, it is required that you fully roleplay because you all are a representative of our guild. It should also be noted and understood that a player does not go too far or overboard with his or her roleplaying style. Roleplaying must never defy anything within the charter of the TNZ/Enoz Eibwen, or the End User Licensing Agreement (EULA) of Sony/Verant's on-line multi-player fantasy game known as EverQuest. Roleplaying is never an excuse for being rude.<BR> <BR>Family Goals<P>The primary goal of the TNZ/Enoz Eibwen family is to promote roleplaying within the game of EverQuest and to assist naked newbies whenever we can. It is not a goal to seek out every person out there and take away our own time for this. It is understood that all of us have the right to hunt on our own or as a group. We all have the right to not go out of our way to help others. No one may require you to help them. We all cannot play 24 hours a day to level up our characters. Therefore, it is a goal for all of us to occasionally set aside time for helping others rather than hunting. If any player character of TNZ/Enoz Eibwen does a service for any other player character of TNZ/Enoz Eibwen, absolutely no payment must be given or accepted. The receiver of service must not offer any form of payment and the giver of service must not accept any form of payment. We help our family members out for free absolutely. However, it is required to say the universal two words of appreciation and gratitude, “thank you”.  Roleplaying is a goal that must prevail above all else. We must all be creative and we must act out our own character's life in game. Whenever we interact with each other, roleplaying is highly encouraged. Whenever we interact with others outside our family, roleplaying is required. It should be understood that we all cannot roleplay non-stop. Too much roleplaying can produce stress upon a player. There is nothing wrong with taking a break and interacting with fellow SD members out of character.<P>It must be known that there are no beggars in the TNZ/Enoz Eibwen family. A beggar refuses to work hard, and a person who refuses to work hard has no place within our family.<P>Player Character Initiation <P>It is required that all players of EverQuest who wish to join the TNZ/Enoz Eibwen family must pass a handful of steps before becoming an official regular member of our guild. From here on, any unique EQ player who wishes to join the Seibwen Dekan family shall be referred as the “candidate”. There is no minimum level requirement to become a regular member of TNZ/Enoz Eibwen.<P>    1.All candidates must visit the official EverQuest The Newbie Zone forum prior to joining. They should read our charter and agree to its terms.  The candidate must read thoroughly this charter prior to joining and if any questions arise concerning our charter, the candidate is strongly recommended to contact the guild master or any officer of TNZ/EE. The candidate must also fully understand and accept the charter prior to joining. <BR>    2.All candidates must have two unique players, who are already active members of the guild, nominate the candidate for membership. The purpose of nominations is to familiarize the candidate with our guild and to allow the candidate to interact with two unique players who are already members of our guild. This gives the nominating members a chance to get to know the candidate better. A primary goal of the  nominations is to hopefully eliminate time-wasting, ridiculous, and illegitimate initiations. Once the candidate has two unique players who are active members willing to nominate the candidate, the two nominating members must notify the guild master (GM) or any officer personally to officially nominate the candidate. The candidate is not allowed to officially announce who nominated him or her. The  nominations must directly come from the two unique players who are active members. <BR>    3. The GM or the officers reserve the right to cancel or deny regular membership into the our family. Only the GM or any officer may officially invite a candidate into TNZ/EE Once a candidate becomes an official regular member of TNZ/EE, the new member must abide by the guild charter for as long as he or she remains a  member. <BR>4. Once a unique player has been successfully initiated and invited into the TNZ/EE family, all characters of that player are automatically initiated and invited to join TNZ/EE. No nominations and initiation quests are necessary or required for all future characters of a player who is already an official regular member or high rank of TNZ/EE. <P><BR>The Rules of TNZ/EE<P>Note: Rules containing * may result in immediate ejection from TNZ/EE if violated. All other rules will result in at least one warning of ejection if violated.<P>    1.*All player characters of TNZ/EE must abide by the guild charter. All PCs in general must abide by the official EULA of Sony/Verant.  If ever an issue arises between this guild charter and the EULA of Sony/Verant, then the Sony/Verant EULA shall prevail and override the guild charter. <BR>    2.All Xev server players of EverQuest who hold a valid and paid EQ account may be eligible to join the TNZ/EE family. The TNZ/EE family does not discriminate real life players based on age, gender, handicap, race, color, national origin, ethnic background, or physical location. The TNZ/EE family does not discriminate EverQuest characters based on level, race, class, or deity. <BR>    3.The personal real life of all players in EverQuest must remain private and undisclosed unless the player chooses on their own free will and without coercion to reveal anything. No one is ever required to reveal personal or sensitive information about themselves. If a player tries to harass another player into giving out personal information, the offender will be ejected. <BR>    4.*Exploitation of bugs within the game of EverQuest is a violation of the EULA of Sony/Verant. A bug is an obvious in game error resulting  from the programming code of the server and/or the client. For example, let's say you kill a very low level mob and it drops a high valued  item that it would not normally drop. The correct procedure would be to immediately report the bug by /petition or email. If you purposely do it again, you are exploiting a bug of the game and the GMs of Sony/Verant may ban you from EverQuest. <BR>    5.*Kill stealing is not roleplaying at all and is not acceptable within TNZ/EE. If anyone accidentally kill steals, immediately notify the victim and apologize to him or her. <BR>    6.*Scamming another player character inside or outside TNZ/EE is not allowed for any reason. If any TNZ/EE player is proven guilty to even attempt a scam but was not successful, that player will be ejected immediately. <BR>    7.No player of TNZ/EE shall put another player into what is known as tell hell. “Tell hell” is to send numerous tells to another player without respecting the other player's right to play on-line without being bothered constantly. However, if the receiving player accepts your tells and does not feel bothered, then this rule has not been violated. <BR>    8.All TNZ/EE players shall never do anything that would tarnish the reputation of the TNZ/EE family as a whole or any individual player in or out of TNZ/EE. This includes but is not limited to libel, slander, ridicule, or any false expressions of any kind. <BR>    9.*Sexual harassment of any kind will result in immediate ejection. Think before you speak or act. Think of the other person first before you say or do something that may offend the other person. <BR>   10.If any TNZ/EE character does a service for another TNZ/EE character, no payment of any kind shall be offered or accepted by both parties. All services performed by a TNZ/EE player character are done absolutely free of charge to another TNZ/EE player character. To clarify, if a TNZ/EE player character performs a service to anyone outside TNZ/EE, then donations or gifts are allowed to be accepted. <BR>   11.No one is ever required to go out of their way for another. You have the right to decline assistance or service to another player character  who requests it from you. We must all understand that we all have the right to our own fair amount of hunting time. However, if you are known to constantly decline services requested of you, then you are defeating the goals of our family and you may be ejected. <BR>   12.One of the biggest problems of EverQuest is that spamming is rampant and plagues us everywhere. We must always try our very best to  never spam the /shout, /ooc, /auction, and /guildsay channels. Do not have a conversation with one player using /shout, /ooc, /auction, or /guildsay when the /tell channel can easily be used. One of our goals is to limit spamming if we cannot eliminate it. The TNZ/EE shall not gain a reputation as a spamming guild. <BR>   13.Twinking is allowed within TNZ/EE. <BR>   14.No one in the TNZ/EE family may beg for money, armor, or weapons from anyone inside or outside the guild. Our family shall never  produce beggars to be let loose throughout Norrath. However, if someone gives you a gift on their own free will, that is fully acceptable. For example, let's say your character is a young wizard and you really don't have much. A stranger comes along and offers to give you the Robe of the Oracle as a gift. By all means, that would be acceptable. But to go out and start asking people for handouts is a violation of this rule and this family.  Beggars must be given nothing at all.<BR>   15.No one is obligated to stay with the TNZ/EE family for any minimum amount of time. Any current TNZ/EE player may leave the guild without any reason and does so on their own free will. However, the guild officers or the GM reserve the right to at least ask the departing member the reason for leaving. The departing member also reserves the right to leave without giving reason. <BR>16. Swearing will not be tolerated in guild chat.<P>Character Promotion<P>Only the Guild Master of TNZ/EE may promote a regular member to officer status. Promotions are based upon the following:<P>      Your pride of being a member of our family. <BR>      Your goals that you wish to accomplish for our family. <BR>      Your personality as a person, not necessarily as a character. <BR>      Your respect and honor for others inside our family and outside as well. <BR>      Your roleplaying ability and skill. <BR>      Your communication skills. <BR>      Your length of time as an active member. Having more seniority does not matter. <BR>      Your devotion to the game as a whole and to our family. <BR>      Your character's experience level. <P>Arbitration<P>If any player of TNZ/EE has a problem or issue of any kind, please contact an officer or the GM of the guild immediately. The high ranks must be fair to everyone at all times. There shall be no favoritism and all of us are equal. “Officer” or “GM” is merely a title, but in actuality we all are the same as individuals. No one is better than the other. <P>If you have a problem with any member of TNZ/EEor any issue you wish to resolve with our guild, please contact a high rank immediately. Please treat the high rank the same way you wish to be treated. Explain carefully your problem or issue to the high rank. Email is a recommended form of communication because the /tell channel is limited. Always understand that we are all human beings playing an on-line fantasy game. Nothing is to be taken too seriously even though many of us are serious players.<P>One important note: If a player is causing a problem for you and you rather not choose to reveal who the offender is, then in all honesty and fairness, nothing much can be done. This is due to the fact that no action can be taken against the offender if the offender is not known.<P>After grieving your problem or issue, please give the high rank a fair amount of time to act and resolve the matter. Although it is the duty of the high rank to resolve matters as quickly as possible, things still do take time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Tirra,<BR>Some feedback on charter.  Seibwen Dekan has got this pretty well refined and there probably isn't much we could do to improve it.<P>Rule #10 - I interperet this to mean that I can't charge for teleporting a member, but if I have a nice item for sale, I can sell it to a member.  The intent is to make help free within the guild, and not to prevent us from selling stuff to each other, correct?<P>For initiation, how about requiring the initiate to complete an officer assigned quest?  This would be some form of helping other players, such as standing in a newbie zone and giving free buffs for 30 minutes, or helping to run a newbie contest.  What do folks think about this?  Of course, charter members wouldn't have to do this.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>nikkon</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
