</FONT><HR>MORE BIND POINTS AND THE ISSUE WITH RESPECT<P>This is a very good idea. Although at this lvl we usually get atleast a revive from clerics, sometimes a cleric isn't around. And for example if I am at SoV and die in Iceclad while being bound at Thurgadin, it leaves me to run through 3 zones with mobs conning from blue to flaming red and everything agros on me. Without SoW and camo I will be as good as dead before even getting out of Great Divide. I acknowledge that SoV was meant to be hard but this just don't cut it.<P>MY SUPERIORITY AS A TANK<P>I may have slightly more HP than a same lvl paladin or shadow knight. But with 2HS I make the same damage as they. While warriors are the defensive class we should also excel in dealing damage. Currently, I feel that a paladin can tank just as good as I and can also heal as a bonus. Takes the point from playing a warrior away.<P>MORE HP AND BIND WOUND<P>Warriors can't solo. Not even with more hp and better bind wound skill. But giving us a hp bonus at higher lvls sure wouldn't hurt. As for binding wounds, my party pack I take on travels with me consists of atleast 4 stacks of bandages, which go really quickly if I get into serious trouble. Using bandages over or having them give back more hp wouldn't hurt either.<P>TAUNT<P>It's worth absolutely nothing. I can't taunt a mob off no matter how hard I try, no matter which weapons I use. And I have it maxed at all times. Even when I am the only one with taunt in group, I can't keep the mob on me.<P>SKILLS POST 35<P>Disarm is fun only in duels. Getting improved attack skill like a sweeping blow or something would be nice. Or headbutt. =)<P>That's just my 2cp.<P>-------<BR>Aniela Winternight<BR>Dark Elf warrioress of 35th circle<BR>Cazic-Thule server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't understand how some people expect a warrior to be superior by asking for a cap 5 or 10 better than the hybrids.  Personally, I think Warriors should have almost double the hit points of a hybrid.  In any Role-Playing System that I've played they've always had at least 30% more hit points that the other classes.<P>Yes, critical hits need to be better and minimum damage needs to be higher.  <P>How about a weapon mastery skill at like level 40 or so. Where you can go above the skill cap to a degree???  But maybe you could only do this once at 40 and maybe once again at like 52 or so.  Making your Warrior only able to be a master in two weapon catergories.<P>Sweep Attack is definately something I would like to see.  Something with a recharge time but maybe not something too crazy high.  But it should have a chance to hit every target with normal damage.<P>My two cents...see yaz</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here's something that's wranckled me for some time and doesn't seem to get a mention was the fact that once a warrior get's past 20th their Consider is less and less reliable.  What I mean is this from lvl 1 to 10 (roughly) I could solo up to whites and yellows, granted a yellow was a risky fight but below lvl 5 I would almost always come out on top.  Lvls 10-15 I could solo a white at great risk.  Past lvl 20 all I can solo a blues and greens (and there are some blues that can still easily kick my butt and send me back to my bind point).  I'm lvl 33 now and have since lvl 20  I have been unable to solo a white, been killed by blues and greens (griffon-esk, which apparently mis-con terribly) while watching cast of equal level to me (mainly casters with pets) solo whites, yellows and even reds.  Someone once told me that the reason behind this is that the warrior's con at higher lvls assumes he is grouped, but that makes no sense a group should allow you to take on much more powerful mobs not just survive against the ones equal to you.  It is in effect an exp cap on the warrior, how many blues will I have to kill, with downtime in between to equal the necro/mage w/ his pet soloing yellows with probably the same amount of down time, less if a wandering enchanter giving them a breeze or clarity.  Which seems more likely to happen than a wandering Cleric, I'm a DE warrior and I've gotten more free breezes than I have mercy healings.  If this exp cap is in place the class exp penalties should not have been removed.<P>My 2cp<BR>Kellavon Fennin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I saw your comment on taunt, indicating that a "smart" high level MOB wouldn't be fooled by a warrior's name calling.<P>Taunt is a "fix" to poor game design, in that MOBs can pass right through the bodies of the biggest, toughest warrior.  It is the ONLY way we have  to control aggro.<P>If you want to get more realistic, put in a GUARD ability, letting warrs get between the MOB and its target, blocking the MOB and taking the damage instead.  Making the war sacrifice his attacks while "guarding" seems fair, and it would let us "rescue" party members in trouble in a more realistic fashion.<P>You want reality?  Come up with a way to let us do our job without feeling like ghosts when a MOB frenzies.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>AoE Taunt: This would be an interesting addition, but I think this would be considered more of a wish-list type item. I would not want to see this added as a discipline...to do so would make sure it would see limited use, and would likely not replace Defensive as the discipline of choice. <P>Increased Hit Points: At high levels, the supposed hit point advantage of warriors becomes less and less significant. Fighting giants in Kael, for example, a few hundred hit points can be lost in mere moments. It ceases to be a defining class advantage, especially considering the nature of NPC's in Velious. If this is going to be considered a great advantage for warriors, a significant boost in our hit points needs to be made. <P>Bind Wound Improvement: The idea that increasing our ability to bind wounds at high levels would reduce downtime for a warrior when fighting solo is somewhat off base. At those levels, we're not going to be fighting without a healer  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> At level 54, I can solo the occasional blue, but I'm not going to be doing so unless I'm simply trying to survive a run across a zone. I'd like to see an improvement in this area; it reduces downtime, yes, but it's not going to affect a warrior's desire or ability to solo in a significant way.<P>Two-Handed weapons and taunt: Barring the rare weapon with a proc capable of drawing major attention, two-handed weapons just don't provide the punch to taunt effectively. Perhaps the taunt value of any hit from a two-handed weapon could be increased, with the current values being multiplied by X to make them effective. <P>Cobalt Helm and Bracer: I'd really expand this to cover all cobalt armor and beyond. AC is considered one of our greatest assets; keep in mind that a warrior's AC depends almost entirely on equipment (with a minor contribution from agility). To truly consider AC the advantage of a warrior, such equipment needs to be obtainable. The warriors in my guild can claim 2 bracers and perhaps 3-4 helmets have dropped for us since Kunark was released. The total number on the server (and likewise on other servers) is not much more than that. The other cobalt pieces are somewhat more common, but not by a great extent. Most warriors of high level are going to have lesser equipment, and as such, won't enjoy the massive AC advantage attributed to warriors. Look at the drop rates for these pieces, and consider adding additional pieces to help ensure we do typically have a higher AC than other classes. <P>Critical hits for low damage: I certainly agree with the sentiment that's it can be annoying to see a critical hit for less damage than we might do with a regular hit. Warrior's don't rely on critical hits as they happen all too infrequently (and for too little damage overall) to have any big impact. We typically consider them eye candy, and we're used to it. I'd love to see improvements here (more frequent with a raised minimum damage value) but this isn't what I would consider a burning issue; taunt comes well before this one.<P>Better Taunt: DING! As some have said, knowledge is the key to using taunt effectively. However, the best comment I've seen on this topic came from a paladin who said they had the advantage here. With the taunt key, melee weapons and spells, they can control their position on an NPC's hate list far more effectively than a warrior can. I think that applies to any other taunting class as well, giving them a significant advantage in this area. Give warriors the tools to exert this same level of control. My suggestion would be a taunt skill that adds a concrete value, not +1 above the next person. Allow that value to increase as the warrior increases in level. By no means do we want an automatically successful taunt...we just want to be at least as effective, if not better, at the job. Currently, we're not. <P>Piercing Skill Cap: As masters of weaponry, and with a supposedly greater selection of weapons available to us, I think having the higher cap is justified.<P>Berserker Frenzy as a skill: My vote would be no on this. Unless it were made FAR more effective, it would not replace Defensive as the discipline of choice. If any changes are to be made to this, go with the idea of making it more than mere eye candy. I liked the idea put forth above by Milena, I believe, increasing the health-percentage at which we start 'zerking, with that percentage increasing at higher levels. As a discipline, this would not be used and would have no impact unless, as I said, it were seriously beefed up to justify regular use.<P>Iksar Planar Armor: Personally, I think the Iksar, in terms of quests, available equipment and general apathy from Verant, have long gotten the short end of the stick. For the purposes of this discussion, however, I'll just say that yes, planar armor (not counting the higher end PoG equipment) should be added for Iksar warriors (...and SKs and Shaman). <P>Respect: It's a point of annoyance that we're the only class without any inherent means of avoiding conflict while traveling. We have to rely on an escort, spells cast by others or equipment to assist us. To an extent, this is something we sacrificed in choosing the class, but Kunark and Velious have upped the scale of these incidental encounters. This may not be a matter of balance, per se, but rather an issue of a particular part of the game being very tedious and time-consuming, far more so than for any other class. <P>Nothing to look forward to from 35th to 50th: This was always a general beef for me, though not something to which you can easily give an answer. Discounting Disarm (hehe), there is really only one skill from 25th to 50th, and that's just boring. The suggested idea is interesting, giving value in some situations. I'm sure other ideas could be suggested as well, to simply give us SOMETHING new at these levels.<P>Equipping shields on the back: A question, do cloaks currently provide an AC bonus only from the back? I like this idea, if only for the fact that it would give me a chance to actually use that silly Nautilus shield I picked up and promptly stored in the bank. My personal opinion is that some/perhaps all shields should be usable in the back slot...without the limitation you suggested. I don't see how this unbalances anything; heck, if this were a warrior-only addition, it gives you a potential way to increase warrior AC in general, a category we should dominate, but strangely do not by any great margin due as I mentioned above. <P>Riposte damage report: I think this is already reported, though perhaps not in the order some would prefer. This is cosmetic, and really has no bearing on balance. <P>Things you failed to list, but should have...<P>1. A question, is there a soft cap on AC of 1100 in any way? If there is an artificial limiting factor of any kind, please factor that into your stance that warriors have a significant AC advantage. A high-level hybrid can reach 1100 AC fairly easily, and if such a limit is imposed, you essentially eliminate any AC advantage warriors should have at high levels. <P>2. Disarm: It works on a small number of NPCs, and I've never seen that it has a significant effect on ANY NPC, with the exception of those NPCs who dual-wield. It's been said that it contributes slightly to taunting...perhaps slightly, but not enough so that I've ever seen it as a  true bonus to taunting. Perhaps removing this skill isn't an option, but I would suggest either boosting it's taunt ability or allowing it to disarm magical weapons into the NPC's inventory. The latter would probably still be a very minor detail, but at least then it would work on Velious NPCs. <P>3. I touched on this earlier, but please accept the idea that equipment DOES in fact have a great deal to do with the balancing of the warrior class. There is no inherent AC bonus for the class, except by virture of our Defense skill...and if said value is increased for Paladins/Shadowknights that ceases to be a warrior advantage. We rely on our equipment for our AC advantage, but there is very little warrior-specific armor (remember, cobalt is extremely rare) for us to get that helps make AC a defining characteristic. Furthermore, I don't see the problems with spells on our armor...for example, the invisibility on the cobalt legs is a luxury; it simply means we won't have to run to a vendor to buy a bag of potions. At the highest levels, I don't see that as a bad thing, but rather a justifiable reward at those levels. Keep those ideas in mind when evaluating a warrior's AC advantage and the available equipment for us. <P>Other items have been brought up as well, that may have been missed...this is what I had time to post this morning  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Back to work!

</FONT><HR>Let me preface this by saying I cut and pasted the whole first thread of the warrior class balance posts. It was about 160 pages + in lenght.<BR>I read your comments and think you missed some things and I also disagree with your reasonings. I have tried to hit the highlights of my thoughts on your thought and hope you take the time to disregard that fact I flamed you earlier in this thread.(Oops shouldn't have brought attention to that.)<P>Warriors:<P>Quote:<BR>============================<BR>ITEM: AoE Taunt.<P>DESCRIPTION: The ability to 'taunt' all of the creatures in your combat range. This would have to be a high level ability, most likely a discipline.<BR>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<BR>My comments: Please please please not another discipline! I can only use one of these at a time. They are nearly useless as it is except in very limited circumstances. If you are not going to make it so we can use more then one whille another recycles then DON"T DO THIS!<P>An AE tuant would be great. But make it  HIGH LEVEL SKILL, NOT ANOTHER DISCIPLINE! I think that is enough emphasis on that. Read Battle Cry comments below(you should have read further into the thread you would have found it)<BR>=========================================<BR>---<BR>ITEM: Increased Hit Points:<P>DESCRIPTION: Some warriors feel that their hit points are too low, at least at the high levels.<BR>++++++++++++++++++++++++<BR>My comments: Agreed. I play a half elf. I have 1920 hps unbuffed. I'm up to 2050 with gear on unbuffed. When I stat'd my player(my fault) I didn't put points into stamina because after playing a half elf ranger I knew that I'd be begging for strenght when I got armor. My fault not yours. But since a warrior/ranger/paladian with the same stam all start out with the same hps I think that in and of itself is wrong. Warriors don't start creating a gap between themselves and hybrids until the bonus levels show up. 25, 30, 35 etc. <P>Since mob hit in the 100's at the levels 45 plus at 51 we should get at least double our normal hps per level. If you're going to take away our ac advantage and our weapons advantage at least gives us something that makes our smallest warrior better then the best hybrids, hit points is the only thing you haven't taken from us. <BR>========================================<BR>---<P>Quote<BR>====================<BR>Bind (Wound) Improvement.<P>DESCRIPTION: An increase in the ability to bind wounds would reduce downtime for a warrior when not grouped with a healer. Of course this would also reduce their downtime when fighting solo.<BR>+++++++++++++<BR>My Comments:  You seem to have a big problem with warriors soloing. Here's news flash, warriors can't solo effectively. Upping the BW ability will still mean they have to sit at 50% to heal up. Even if a warrior can find a blue he/she can kill he still have a 7 to 10 minutes sit. <P>Warriors are very equipment dependant. We are only as good as our weapons and armor. If our weapons are not significantly better then our opponents ability to deal damage we usually lose. <P>Who cares if it takes me 20 bandages to bind to 50% or just 7. Point is until I make a 200 skill I can't bind to 70% anyhow. If fix it so we can't reach 200 BW's until level 50 you don't have to worry about us soloing much. Why? Because unless you're a warrior with the best uber weapons most high green can kill you. If they don't they run now and bring back friends.<P>You give this to monks who are supposed to be masters of mind and body. They can fear feign death, sneak, and mend their wounds. A monk can get his ac darn near close to a warriors and in many cases(because the rarity of warrior armor's) get better ac. Most importantly they can heal themselves past 50%. Their BW skill maxes prior to level 51 at 200. <P>I purpose that warriors are also masters of mind and body. But warriors are not evaders, like monks. However, we are of this same fighter class as monks. Ergo, we should have the higher BW skill like the monks.<P>I would as a warrior like at least the option to keep on raising my BW skill after level 20. As it stands I have to wait 31 levels to do so. I do not see this as a class balance issue like based on your comments it is. I see this as something that would enhance the game for the players and the groups.<BR>============================<BR>---<P>Quote:<BR>===================<BR>ITEM: Furious discipline is bugged.<P>DESCRIPTION: Furious, the level 56 discipline, appears to be broken. It seems that it allows ripostes on all attacks, even those that come from the rear. Against attacks from the back, it prevents the attack and the damage, but then reports the 'you can't see your target' message, and fails to deliver damage to the attacker.<BR>++++++++++++<BR>My comments: If it is bugged fix it. But make sure the part you are fixing is that part about the "you can't see your target"  when you try to attack a mob.<P>Actually, I'm not sure this is really broken. If I'm in a furious rage I am seeing and sensing all things at once. You don't necessarily have to see a mob to block his attack. You do have to see him to hit him with your own attack. <P>Think of riposte/parrying/dodging attacks from behind as using periferal vision like a linebacker in football. First those that played alot developed eyes in the "back of their heads" or a feel or a sense of what is going on around them. When chasing a running back down the line of scrimmage you have your eyes on your quary but are aware of what is around you with your periferal visions. If someone tries to block you riposte/shed the blocker him but keep your eyes on on the guy with the ball. You can sometime feel too from behind what is about to happen. That is what riposte is. <P>Eye contact is important but even in the martial arts you are trained to sense all around you. So even if attacked from behind you can defend yourself and minimize or even prevent the damage from an opponent. <P>So you should be able to riposte even things that attack from behind. And even if they are targeted they you shouldn't necessarily be able to attack with your own offensive melee without first facing your opponent.<P>I'd say there is not need for change on this.<BR>===============<P>---<BR>Quote:<BR>=====================<BR>ITEM: Cobalt Helm and Bracer.<P>DESCRIPTION: Players feel that the drop rate on these two items is far lower than it is on the rest of the Cobalt armor, and they would like it increased.<BR>++++++++++++++++++++<BR>My comments: Drops are too rare. I won't get into the buffs but I am not a fan or warriors having procs on their armors either.<BR>==================================<P>---<P>Quote:<BR>===================<BR>ITEM: Critical hits for low damage.<P>DESCRIPTION: When a warrior gets a critical hit, having it hit for less than a normal hit can be distressing. Perhaps putting a minimum damage on a crit (or raise it if there is one now) to be close to their normal maximum damage would be a good idea. So, if the damage generated is less than their normal maximum, raise it to that maximum.<BR>+++++++++++++<BR>My comments: Could we get an extra tuant built into the crits and crip hits too? May be stuns for Crits too?<BR>==========================<P>---<BR>Quote:<BR>==============================<BR>ITEM: Better Taunt.<P>DESCRIPTION: Warriors want to be able to taunt more effectively at the higher levels. It may be, though, that the problem isn't with their ability to taunt, but with the taunting of other classes. Also, players are not supposed to be able to dictate the actions of higher level monsters. They are supposed to be smart enough to kill who they think needs killing, and they are not supposed to be tricked by simple name calling… But this should be looked at along with the big picture, perhaps warriors should have a greater ability to taunt.<BR>++++++++++++++++++++++<BR>My comments:  Have you ever wondered why Rangers have such a high tuant factor? And why you need to put in ways for them to lower it? I think it is very easy. <BR>1.)Look at their weapons. Most have a group friendly proc with a serious tuant spell and now. Make an honest comparison between warrior plane weapons and rangers. Warrior get great 2h weapons(but ultra rare) and a crudy 1hs weapon(whip) which is little better then a barbed leather whip. Rangers get several very good 1hs proc'ng weapons. They can actually use these. Notice a difference? Is painbringer(Trainbringer) really a group friendly weapon?<P>2.) Ranger weapon skills are very much like warriors and now you're making it equal. The other thing I noticed is rangers don't miss as often as warrior. (Impirical observation) That coupled with the fact that their weapons are more common, better, and faster make their skills more "tuanting". You are fixing to increase their skills more. You're going to get an even bigger disparity in tuant now.<P>3.) Spells they have snare flame lick can piss a mob of any level off until it is nearly<BR>"untuantable." Warrior have zero spells to offset that.<P>If a warrior isn't getting hit they aren't doing their job. This point has been made over and over. With all these agro abilities by hybrids the warrior has to rely on pure luck to get a mob off a hybrid for at least one melee round. <P>I also don't think any mob should be untauntable. I think if there's a someone who should be able to do it it should be a warrior. I will say more later because there were several suggestions made to help fill this tuant gap.<P>Solutions: Add new skill mentioned below and raise our tuant cap to 225 or 250. We are the best we should be the best with out any question.<BR>===============================================<BR>---<BR>Quote:<BR>===================================<BR>ITEM: Berserker Frenzy as a skill.<P>DESCRIPTION: This has the potential to be significantly overpowering, but it's certainly interesting. The idea is to turn berserking into a skill or discipline with a recycle time and a duration that balances out the fact that they can do this at will. This might also mean the removal of the berserk code for low health. Perhaps the berserk skill would drain stamina and then, when stamina was gone, hit points.<BR>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<BR>My comments: Making this a skill is a very big mistake I my opinion. Leave this alone but if you do anything to let it be triggered earlier and last longer after you're healed. But making it a separate skill is going to ruin it.<P>This is the only time a Warrior can stun, crippling hit, an opponent and make sure it sticks. I have used this with the Discipline: Mighty Strike and Survived a major trains in POH before. <P>Example: Someone pulled a train. my healer goes down and I have one of several mobs on me. the necro is mez'ng everything in site. I go beserk and a gargoyle attacks. I turn to fight it while the group kills a cleric. I am near dead(under 200 hps) I hit the skill and boom, the mob is stun for the next 10 seconds while the group finishes and comes to help me. If my crippling hits weren't stunning the mob I would have die. It's nice to finish the fight for once.<P>I like this the way it is, although crippling hits are way too in frequent. Please try to use some of the suggestions if you want to create a new skill. Don't take an existing ability and ruin it because if I know you all, you will put it on a 1 hour cycle like HT or Lay Hands. That's just wrong. This is the result of our rage building during the battle, not something we can just trigger ourselves.<BR>====================<BR>--<BR>Quote:<BR>=======================<BR>ITEM: Respect.<P>DESCRIPTION: The idea here would be that a deadly warrior shouldn't be jumped on by little green beetles when wandering back to his corpse. They should fear his dangerous fighting power. The gameplay point here is that warriors have no way of travelling safely among otherwise annoying greens. Where a caster would go invisible, a warrior has to fight off hordes of weak enemies.<BR>++++++++++++++<BR>My comments:  This and several other comments were made to address a warriors ability to travel. I'm not sure you can do this so I wish you'd consider the others. Logically speaking if a mob sees a naked warrior known and feared throughout the land running to retrieve their body that mob will say "now's our chance to rid the land of this scourge" and attack. It would be nice to not have greens attack but not really possible without major recoding. So lets look at things at things that are possible.<P>First New skills were presented in various but to summarize them, they fall into the catagory of AE fear/tuants/stuns and sprinting. These can be combined into two new skills at level 40 and 45 to bridge the gap between 35 and 51.(Told you I'd solve this problem.<P>1.) AE fear/Stun/Tuant can be handled by a skill called Battle(War) Cry. This is an enchanced  tuant(handles tuant) that will Fear & Stun a mob(not send him fleeing like instill doubt) and after it recovers it becomes very mad(mega tuant). It can be on it's own timer liek tuant but I'd like it to have a recycle only slightly longer then regular tuant. May be more like 1 minutes instead of every 30 to 45 seconds like tuant. This would be a useful skill and address several of the problems warriors have expressed.<P>2.) Sprint, (this is not my favorite) the way it works is you have the ability to run very fast (SOW+) speeds. I would alter it so that it can be a zone only and leaves when you hit the zoneline  or like spirit of the cheetah duration. It should stack with sow but when it's gone not remove sow. I'd consider putting a stamaina penalty on it. Finally, since it's for corpse recovery make it's effectiveness based on the amount weight you are carrying. Say 15(monks weight limit) so you can at least carry one 2h weapon.<BR>====================<BR>---<BR>Quote:<BR>==================<BR>ITEM: Nothing to look forward to from 35th to 50th.<P>DESCRIPTION: There are no skills for a warrior to gain in this level range. One suggestion about what could be added is some sort of sweeping blow skill that would allow a warrior to hit multiple targets within his combat range. This should probably only work with a two-handed weapon. The skill would be linked to the Bash and Kick timers, and would probably not do full damage to each creature, perhaps only doing a comparable amount of damage with Bash.<BR>++++++++++++++++<BR>My Comments: Sweeping Blow Skill? You made that one up Absor. I read the thread and your comments and you liked the idea of a warrior hitting multiple mobs but no one from what I recall suggested this.<P>&lt;Looks into my Crystal Ball&gt;I see many groups dying from this. Hit at the wrong time I see many many angry enchanters and guildmates while they hope a cleric camped out. I hope this is put on its own timer and leave bash and kick alone. <P>You are trying to do something innovative but you are not thinking about the group the way you think this skill should work. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;One hit on a mob even with an AE way to tuant will not be useful to a group. It doesn't raise the agro enough to make you the "most wanted man".&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; In dungeons you need to minimize the number of fights going on at a time, fd pulling, mez'ng mobs etc. This skill would break every AE mez. <P>Actually all I see you're new skill doing as proposed is the Three Stooges effect. A whole lot of mobs get hit but no one hurt. And lots and lots of dead Enchanters and clerics.<P>Maybe it would be nice to have. Put it at 50 then but give use at least one of the two I have suggested. previously before it.<BR>=========================<P>---<BR>Quote:<BR>=====================<BR>ITEM: Equiping shields on the back.<P>DESCRIPTION: Allowing shields to be used in back slots. A popular idea, and it makes some sense, assuming the shield only gave an armor class bonus from the back.<BR>++++++++++++<BR>My comments: No flames here. I got a lucky roll and love my new Lodizal Shell shield! I wear it on my back.<BR>=====================<P>I hope you read this one and try to use what I have said.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor.  I think your summary is great thanks for addressing our concerns.<P>Can you just please verify that two items are going to come up in the general summary you reference.  <P>First the concern about the warrior epic.  I know you did say this but we it really does need to be re-vamped.  Its hard enough to do withou the drops being super rare.  I think you said you would address epics in another summary so please do as this is really one where we have gotten the short end.<P>Disarm.  This pertains to a few classes and not just warriors.  Again I hope in your general summary you address this issue.  It really is USELESS.  I mean it does nothing.  Not only does it not make any difference in how hard a mob hits, sometimes the disarmed weapon disappears completely.<P>I think if you could just re-verify that these issues will be addressed at a later date that would be great.

</FONT><HR>Shadu1, Disarm works. I know I've used it alot. It's effectiveness is a function of your dexterity. I have been buff up and the higher my dexterity the greater my frequency fo disarms, tested pvp and against mobs. I have dropped 2h weapons in people's inventories with my dex at 250 plus. I can even at 110 dex disarm most every mob in norath not counting magic weapons. So disarm works. Get a dexterity buff and see.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I would agree that disarm has a greater utility in PvP combat...until the target is able to re-equip, their offense is significantly affected. This is not the case in PvE, as mobs seemingly hit just as hard without a weapon. In Velious, I don't know that anything carries a non-magical weapon making it entirely useless. It has been said that Disarm helps taunt; I would say I've not personally seen that this is the case, at least to any significant degree. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Yes, in Velious Disarm is completely useless.  The only changes would be to NOT knock a weapon on the ground, but simply drop it into the MoB's inventory,(like is does in PvP, or duels)  and then make them hit for less dmg, say a 10% drop in damage.  I don't want Magical weapons dropping on the ground.  Since half the time I disarm one from something I leave it LAY there, or overlook it.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Disarm does what it is intended I think. But needs improvement. Like not dropping a weapon on the ground. If we could get them to drop in the mobs inventory, then we could disarm those nasty magic ones that proc. <P>But it does work. The problem is that Velios is mostly all magic weapons. So all disarm is good for is raising your tuant agro some more. But if we could drop the weapon in thier inventory then that would be nice.<P>Sadly, many times you are better off not disarming a mob. If they are swinging a slow 1h or 2h weapon then you want them to keep using that. I can't count the times I regreted taking a weapon off an NPC to find it hit so much harder without the weapon. But this is not the fault of disarm. It's how they programed the damage tables for mobs.<P>Summary: Disarm does work but needs improvement.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Why bother playing a warrior when you don't get anything special all the hybrid classes have SPELLS added to there arsonal..Come on guys..<P>The rest of you good warriors reading this please bump these issues over and over again so we can be heard and no longer ignored..Remember all the other classes got fixxed after they complained like hell now its our turn! add a coment like this to the end of your post so this gets going like wildfire its the only way to get others to keep bumping.   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here's my input.<P>*** AoE Taunt ***<P>I've been talking about this since my level 30-somethings.  Very important to use if crowd control isn't working or available.  Also great for hasty retreats on foot.  I'd rather see this as a SKILL, not a DISCIPLINE.  It should have a hefty fresh rate compared to our normal taunt, but not on the scale that the disciplines have.<P>*** Increased Hit Points ***<P>Sure, why not?  I can always use more hit points.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>*** Bind Wound Improvement ***<P>This would be nice for emergencies, but not as high on my list.<P>*** 2H and Taunt ***<P>Adding some kind of extra taunt effect to using a 2H weapon would give Warriors a reason to actually use them on a regular basis.  The only 2H I use anymore is my Nathsar Greatsword, and only because it has a very low delay for a 2H.  (17/30 btw)  It's still not as efficient as dual wielding a Crystallized Sword (11/29) and a Smoldering Brand (9/22).<P>*** Furious Discipline ***<P>I wouldn't know, I'm not 56 yet.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>*** Cobalt Drops ***<P>I got a pair of Cobalt gloves on a lucky drop; amazingly enough the very kill that gave me 49th level dropped them.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  As far as the rest, I'm not very concerned myself.<P>*** Critical Hits for Low Damage ***<P>There's nothing sillier than crit'ing for less damage than you normally hit.  And yes, I know to check the actual text line that tells you how much you it for.  A minimum damage for crits and crippling blows would be great.<P>*** Better Taunt ***<P>This is such a broad category, that most fixes for this general category have been mentioned in Absor's post.  So many factors go into making taunting effective.<P>*** Piercing Cap ***<P>Sure, why not?  I can understand how Rogues would be able to surpass Warriors in piercing skill, however.  Daggers and the like are really secondary weapons for a Warrior, traditionally.  And spears/pikes/etc. really should have been made a 2H Piercing.  I want to laugh when I see a Rogue carrying around a huge spear.  Yeah, right...<P>*** Berserker Frenzy ***<P>Unnecessary.  I think keeping it how it works now is just fine.  I love roleplaying my Halfling Warrior as a mindless, berserk killing machine after a tough fight.  Those who know her know to give her a wide berth until she "calms down".  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"><P>*** Iksar Planar Armor ***<P>Give them some!  If there had been Iksar around when I started my Warrior oh so long ago, it would have been a tough choice between Halfling and Iksar.  My scaly Warrior brothers and sisters deserve this.<P>*** Respect ***<P>YES!!!!!!!  YES!!!!!!  YES!!!!!!!<BR>It's extremely frustrating to just stand there at your bind point whilst everyone els ein your group can do -something- to help with CR.  And when it's just you getting your corpse back...well...you're pretty much screwed.  Perhaps give us an ability to create a "bubble" around us that will scare off anything green to the Warrior for a certain amount of time, with a LoH/HT length refresh.  It won't give Leata an excuse to get sloshed in a bar while CR goes on though...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif"><P>*** No Skills 35-50 ***<P>Yeah, nothing cool for 15 levels, but it doesn't bother me much. /shrug  Probably a good place to stick all these extra skills/disciplines mentioned here.<P>*** Equipping Shields on the Back ***<P>Another awesome idea!  There really -are- no really good cloaks out there for Warriors that are not god/dragon/uber loot.  Hell, I still wear the Cloak of the Ice Bear I got in the mid 20s.<P>*** Riposte Damage Report ***<P>Ummm, well, it does.  Just above the text line reporting a riposte.  Put it below, maybe?<P>*** Leata's Recap ***<P>Very Important<BR>--------------<BR>AoE Taunt, Low Crits, 2H Taunt, Iksar Planar, Respect<P>Important<BR>---------<BR>Increased Hit Points, Bind Wound, Better Taunt, 35-50 skills, Shields in Back Slot<P>Don't Bother<BR>------------<BR>Piercing Cap, Berserk Frenzy, Riposte Reporting<P>In addition, I've no real opinion on the Cobalt Drops and the Furious Discipline problems.<P>==========<BR>Leata Amberthorn<BR>51st Warrior<BR>Champion of the Dia Luxa<BR>Guild Evoluxa, Brell Serilis Server<P>"One who knows the enemy and knows himself will not be in danger in a hundred battles."<P>-- Sun Tzu, "The Art of War"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>When many of you think of taunt what do you think of? HEY YOU #*&$# COME GET ME!! YOU STINK #(*$(#$?<BR>It's not what I think of, and it's not what I'd imagine a Warrior doing. Perhaps a warrior could be saying some foul things in ear shot of his enemy that is right next to him. But mostly a warrior will be shoving, pushing pulling an enemy, which realistically would do no damage but would get an enemies attention. I actually think Taunt should be removed or at high levels be replaced with something like "Provoke" which may actually do something like a Force Shock and push the enemy away a bit (without doing damage of course). Warriors are a good class, I have a 52 warrior myself, but they can be a GREAT class without giving him spells or changing them a whole lote, just need a little imagination</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This post doesnt really belong here but I wanted to give some input on having the bracer and helm increase in drop rate. What I think is that cobalt drops as it is supposed to drop... Its the other class armors that drop to often. I cant give away a deep water helm or singing steal arms, we camped the chef in seb one night for about 4 hours and everyone in the group got singing steal arms, now this is rare but it happened - 6 arms in 4 hours... These items are truely worthless and have become twink items, I gave the arms I got away. I really think the bracer and the helm should stay as is. I think the other kunark armors should be halfed in drop rate, maybe even more than halfed.<P>If these drop rates do increase, I think a new form of armor should come out. Instead of making lore or no drop...  make the item warrior drop - meaning that only warriors can drop this item. If another class loots it then it is no drop... if a warrior loots it then it is droppable. Basically making the kunark class specific armor only tradable within the class. <P>Reduce all class specific armor drop rates to the same as the cobalt bracer. These items shouldnt be worthless.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>To reiterate, do not raise the HP amount.  Clerics and other healers have enough to heal as is.  Increase the worth of AC, that is our bread and butter, and get rid of the infamous soft cap.  Give an AC bonus or something based on a percentage of certain items.  If AC can't be improved then yes, by all means, give us more HP.  But need to remember that even if you give us more HP, it has to be significant amount since higher lvl mobs tag for 300-500 dbl attack so a little more HP would be meaningless.  Increasing AC is the best answer to missing those hits and decreasing the dmg of those blows.<P>Make ALL class specific armor NO DROP and as for quests, make the hardest piece to get No Drop also.

</FONT><HR>RE: Cobalt helm/bracer drop rates.<P>I would MUCH rather they increase the drop rates of the quest items necessary for the Kael/Thurgadin/Skyshrine armors.  This would help out everyone, not just warriors.<P>Cobalt helm is only useful to 2 of the 11 races that can be warriors, and cobalt bracer is nothing but a novelty to 8 of the 11 races.  Additionally, Berserker's, Warlord's, Myrmidon's, and Champion's armor are better for nearly every other slot.<P>Cobalt gauntlets?  Pfft, the effect is awful, I have never encountered someone who actually uses it, and I don't even bother making a hotkey for mine.  10 second cast time, can't remove your own buff, and warriors have no channelling ability so anything interrupts us.  Yeah, that's useful.  I'd gladly take any of the velious gauntlets.<P>Cobalt boots?  I'd prefer one of the velious boots over a non-stacking self-only str buff.  Str doesn't do a whole lot anyway and when it matters, there's someone available to give you a better buff than the boots can do.<P>Cobalt bracer?  If you're not a large race (and despite what some large race warriors think, there are many non-large warriors) it's just a novelty.  I'd much rather have one of the velious bracers, similar AC, and stats + resists.<P>Cobalt helm?  Possibly the most short-sighted warrior-only item they've ever given us.  Infravision is only useful to humans and barbarians, and there are more non-human, non-barb warriors than there are human and barb warriors, making this helm's effect useless to the majority of warriors.  Any of the velious helms are better.<P>Cobalt arms?  Nice effect, admittedly, though it has some stacking issues.  Velious arms are quite nice, too.<P>Cobalt breastplate?  Nah, berserker's is easier to get and is way better, just uglier.  Same effect, better stats, better AC, more HP, and resists.  Cobalt BP sucks compared to berserker's.  The other velious breastplates should be very similar to berserker's, but apparently the items needed are insane drops, which is why they should be increased.<P>Cobalt legs?  These are a matter of opinion, I suspect.  While invis is a cool effect, I can get the same thing from an incarnadine breastplate (usable from inventory) or 10 plat invis potions.  At the level where cobalt/velious armors become feasible, 10 plat for an invis potion is nothing.<P>To be honest, if I could choose my armor (yeah, like that's ever gonna happen) I'd not select a single piece of cobalt.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The biggest problems I see for the warrior class is the armor issue and the taunt issue.<P>I will not comment on the taunt issue as it has been covered very well by other warriors in these threads. My concern is armor. Cobalt drop rates have been mentioned a lot, but that is just a small part of the larger problem.<P>The problem is that there is not enough variety of armor for warriors (and all armor wearing classes honestly) and availability of what armor does drop.<P>The average warrior probably has full crafted by the mid 30s and has little to upgrade to. The next meaningful step up is Indicolite armor from the Plane of Hate. This is no drop armor that many players are never going to see as the planes are typically packed. The next step up is the new Velious quest armor or Cobalt. The Velious quest armor is difficult at best to get and Cobalt has its own set of problems. There is no good armor set in between crafted and planar. This is a huge problem for most warriors who will probably not see Hate armor and will, at most get a piece or two of Cobalt.<P>So, Verant has created a situation where there are a lot of warriors attempting to get high level armor that is rare. Link that to the way hogh level monsters are designed (to hit hard and fast and require the tank to have high ac.) and there is a problem. The game has been designed so that high level encounters assume the best of gear. Yet the best warrior gear (Cobalt) has the worst drop rate of any class armor and the new Velious stuff is as hard or harder to get and does not address the armor gap between Crafted and planar.<P>I have two suggestions to help with this problem, and I do think it is the biggest one that effects warriors. Armor and weapons are to a warrior what new spells are to a caster. Yet until the 50s a caster can feel secure that they will get new spells every few levels in a constant manner. Warriors (and other melee) must get equipment to stay in the power curve. Good weapons are not a problem. They are very available at all level ranges. Armor is not. <P>My two suggestions-<BR>1.) Make a new set of armor quests targeted at the AC range in between Crafted (22ac on the BP) and Indicolite (25 ac on the BP.) A breastplate with AC 29 or 30 would be in line with this sort of armor. Make it difficult and expensive, but make it so that more warriors can get armor that will at least give them a moderate armor class as they approach the 50s.<P>and/or<P>2.) Make the older planar armor tradeable. I understand why it was originally made no drop. It WAS the best armor in the game till Kunark. It WAS a huge status symbol. With the different Velious quest armor and Cobalt armor now much better than Indicolite, it would make sense that it was tradable. That would open up a new armor market that a savvy 45+ character could work with. I suggest doing this for all Fear and Hate class armor. <P>Please take this into consideration when making the final list. More armor options helps all the classes and gives more flexibility to the melee classes.<P>Thank you,<BR>Baarak Orchammer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One of the annoying things about mobs is that they can run straight through you, and will if you don't taunt well enough.  How about changing the taunt like this:<BR>old taunt skill becomes an ability to root one target as long as he is facing you (you are in his riposte arc for example).  You are now blocking his path.  This would be unresistable save for extreme size differences (difficult for a halfling to block a dragon's way).  Because of the limitations (you need to form a defensive line) virtual auto-success,  or at least no check against the mob's lvl, is appropriate.  This would allow the tanks to save the casters.<BR>Then disarm would become some sort of hate list modifier (add some fraction of the skill value in hate?) to save the rangers/rogues.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Milena, you make some good points on the Cobalt armor. For myself, I'd love the bracer (though I do have a pre-nerf Deceiver mask that essentially covers the same purpose...I just like being Mini-Mongo) and the legs (while I can buy the potions, I'd love the invis effect so I could free up a bag for all this dang resist gear <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ). I guess I'd like to see the drop rates for Cobalt examined simply because there are indeed people who don't want to go to Velious (or may not own it) and also because I like to see the variety. As warriors, we should have more options in terms of what equipment we get. You make a good point (that as you said, benefits all classes) in that quest items for the various Velious armor should be looked at and probably increased. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oli I think you summed it up in your second post and others said it as well. I did not mean literally that disarm does not fuction.  Sure you can disarm a mob with a FS weapon.  But I meant that it does no good.  Like you said many times a mob will hit HARDER without their weapon than they did with it.  It either needs to be revised to make it useful or removed and replaced by a skill that actually does some good.  I didn't spell all this out in my post because it had been detailed out in many previous posts when the warrior discussion was going on.  Absor should know the concerns about disarm from reading those posts and probably from other classes that have the skill and have similar issues.   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Lots of good ideas, warriors.  Besides the taunt concepts (most of which I like, including the AoE taunt), my favorite is the idea of specialization in a specific weapon skill to give the weapons more oomph.  However, I think it could just about be covered by increasing the 1HS/2HS cap(s).  After all, what warrior is going to pick anything besides one of these two considering the epic weapon is both?  If you're going to leave the effects of melee damage/speed the same in regard to what taunts more, then obviously 1HS would be the best place to increase the skill cap (a lot).<P>This method could also be useful in increasing the number of crits (which a few warriors have noted, accurately, are mainly eye candy), perhaps by coding so that once the current cap is passed the critical hit frequency goes up significantly, perhaps even with a very small chance of a crippling blow now and again.  This would allow those warriors who have been "stuck" with using two fast weapons instead of one or two high-damage weapons feel a little better about it, AND it should result in higher taunt effects with the weapons at high levels as well.<P>By making this *one* (well, two if you count increasing the cap and increasing the crit frequency as two) change, you could theoretically address several concerns at once, including:  idea of activatable berserking skill (made irrelevant by increased crit frequency), taunt problems (eased by doing more damage), dissatisfaction with low damage on fast weapons that are virtually *required* by most warriors and hit points (in the sense that battles are going to be that much shorter, thus increasing the *effectiveness* of their hit points, with the warrior getting measurably more critical hits at high levels).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I would like to see something to the effect of a controlled crit. Mainly because Warriors have the most basic play style... even Monks have more variations. Anyways... here's my suggestion.<P>Mighty Blow: Activatable skill with a 30-60 second refresh. Upon activation you stop attacking as a 3 to 5 second wind up time ticks down similar to a casting time. The skill can be interupted, with less interuption chance with higher levels. Works with 2 handed weapons only. Damage should be similar to a backstab.<P>I believe a skill like this would put warriors slightly closer to Monks and Rogues in damage dealing, but only when the group already had another warrior filling the Primary Tank role as well as give warriors a new play characteristic and motivation to use thier 2 handed weapons.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I feel that the "crit and crip" feature should also be looked at due to the reason, we can waste it on a bash or a kick.  I mean..i have always thought that they where like a sudden burst of energy that makes them hit harder, and I would think that if I had a sudden burst of energy i would swing my big ass blade at the enemies head rather then punching or kicking him.....<P>just my 2cp...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>AC - Soft cap of 1100 - Change the curve for warriors to make 1300 AC mean more than it does  as we are by far the most item dependant class.  Perhaps the 'soft cap' could raise along with levels post-50?<P>Weapons Vs. Taunt - The suggestion of each taunt attempt helping to add to the hate-list just might make the most sense and HELP the weapon situation where low delay and procs are a warrior's best taunt.<P>AOE Taunt - Would be a great SKILL.  Make it a longer reuse time perhaps?  Combine it with actually 'fixing' taunt in general or it'd be mostly worthless of course.  Make this in the level 35-50 range?<P>Disarm - Perhaps a successful 'disarm' should 'weaken' a foe?  I'm not sure there really is a good use for this other than pulling without getting DT'd or duels as you can't even disarm a magic weapon in a non-dueling situation ... not that NPC damage/delay will change much anyway.<P>AOE Melee - Velious NPC's can do it and this is really a better option to obtain a 'taunt'.  I would see this as a potential 'ultimate' high level discipline.  Hell, make it a level 60 questable skill we 'learn' and can then improve.  Be creative!<P>Stats - Soft caps should be reexamined or increase the bonuses given on 'high-end' items such that instead of +25 HP's we would receive +100 or instead of +5 xx stat, it might be +15.<P>1H/2H Pierce - Should max the same as all other weapon skills.<P>2H Max/Min Hits - I still firmly believe this is not comparible to dual wielding.  You miss too much and swing less often.  There should be a higher minimum hit and more of a chance of a 'bigger' hit for wielding a 'bigger' weapon.<P>Berserker SKILL - Leave it the way it is or make an entirely new berserker skill to do something such as aoe melee, invincibility, increased damage output (not just on rare crippling blows), etc.  Perhaps as a SKILL, it could be a way to do something similar to a discipline where you risk increased damage taken in the hopes of dealing more damage quickly?  Alternatively, it could be a defensive skill to stay alive longer until help is found.  If nothing else, raise what HP % going berserk occurrs at with levels +50.<P>HP's - An absolutely uber-equipped level 60 cleric can self-buff to nearly the AC and HP's of an unbuffed average level 60 warrior (Cobalt is rarer).  Paladins have nearly a warrior's HP's and can just stun to taunt.  Sure warriors can do more overall, but the HP differential SHOULD be larger considering the overwhelming power that spells can bring to someone who is truly SKILLED at using them.  IE: The HP differential should be reexamined to set warriors further apart *if* other issues with hybrids and casters are similarly being fixed.  To do otherwise will put warriors back to the afterthought they were pre-Kunark.<P>Warrior Epic - Add Haste and/or lower primary hand delay.  Consider changing drop rates on parts of the quest or adjusting Epic weapon power versus the difficulty to aquire them.<P>Archery - Target too high/low should be looked at.<P>Bind Wound - Getting to 201 should not magically be where the percentage raises to 70.<P>Respect - To some extent, this is already in place and allows for single pulling in areas that lower levels could not.  I see no reason to do this ... find an invis or risk death like a true warrior!<P>Disciplines - Reduce the reuse time across the board, especially on one-hour disciplines.  Perhaps combine or replace this request with death resetting these times.<P>Skills - Let a warrior 'master' a particular area such as reposting, offense, 1HS, dodging, etc and go beyond the normal mastery cap.  This would further the ability for warriors (and melee) to create a more individualized role in the game.<P>Cobalt Wrists - Way too rare but still an item no large-raced warrior would pass up.<P>Cobalt Helm - Way too rare but there is now better out there, especially for those already with night-vision.  Perhaps change this to Ultravision at the very least?<P>Cobalt Gaunts - SOV gaunts are now better stats on top of this having a useless spell.  Someone posted suggesting different spell variations on the same armor type.  This might be cool and a good way to add some uniqueness to a high level warrior's arsenal and choices.<P>More bind spots/teleport spots - The lack of reward and incentive to visit less-used areas would be lessened in this way.  Still, people will always flock to zones that are crowded when they want to find a pickup group, but this should help more than it hurts.<P>Protect/guard skill - Saw this post and I see good and bad but ... Designate one group member to 'protect' via switching targets to defend.<P>Bash door? - Saw this posted - why can't a melee have a chance to bash down a locked door?  You say that nothing should be 100% dependant on one class's availability yet look at doing a COM, Chardok, Howling Stones, OS Rare Hall, etc raid.  100% dependancy on a 201+ skill and on ONE particular class.<P>----<P>Manna shield for wizards: Targetable - Spells cast on that target are absorbed/mitigated up to a point.  The way wizards stand now, they do not do much that druids don't already do just as well.  I suggested something similar to Translocate over a year ago in a warrior thread that discussed something similar to disciplines heh.  Would love to see a 'manna damage shield' implimented too.<P>Ariakis - Warlord of Fenin Ro<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hey guys,<P> I have played a warrior on CT for 55 levels. The one major problem i really have is boredom. I mean..taunt kick disarm gets pretty boring after  the first 50 levels. I tried mixing it up..ya know...kick taunt disarm...and yeah even disarm kick taunt...but it was no use. When i first made my warrior about 14 months ago i thought warrior...god he is gunna kick so much a$$ be the awesome heavy hitter damage dealin guy. Then after months of playing i find out my job is to take damage??? ***...what fun is standing there TAKING damage while doing mediocre damage. I can deal with not beina  damage dealer..but please give us something that will break up the routine. I have been playin a monk for the past few months because of boredom. How bout sumthin fun for warriors that will make em fun to play</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1) All good warrior equipment is hard to get, not just the cobalt helm and bracer, even though the warrior is the most equipment-dependent of any class.  It drops more rarely than any other classes equipment, and costs much more when bought from players.<P>2) At very high levels in actual gaming situations, warriors don't have much of a hit point advantage over other tanking classes, and many of these other classes can self-heal.<P>3) If there is a soft-cap on ac over 1100, this totally negates any ac advantage warriors may have over other classes at high levels.<P>4) I like the idea of giving warriors the ability to 'guard' other players.  IE, I guard PlayerX, and I can parry blows aimed at them, or take hits that would otherwise have landed on PlayerX.<P>5) Warriors need some way to avoid getting killed by green mobs that most other classes could either easily avoid or easily kill.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Everyone agrees that Taunt is broken, but is it the skill or the action that is the problem? I agree with Absor when he states that just by using the Taunt skill (ie yelling insults at a creature) shouldn't put you at the top of the list all the time. It just doesn't make sense. Another way a Warrior 'taunts' his opponent is by the damage and rate he hits the said opponent. Unless you've got super-weapons that extremely fast at dealing damage, a average Warrior cannot fulfil his role properly.<P>Looking at this problem from a different angle, a Warrior is supposed to be a fighter who is THE master of melee both in regards to offence and defence (not necessary the  greatest damage dealer though) but this is not the case. Warriors get the Double Attack skill at Level 15, which at that time helps us taunt even better, but it isn't until 45 levels later that we finally get a Third attack. From a Roleplaying perspective, wouldn't it seem reasonable that as a Warrior became more experience at his 'craft' he would find ways to utilised his weapons better and be able to hit quicker by adding extra attacks in? Why is it that only right at the end of our careers we finally get given a 3rd attack as some token reward?<P>Looking at the 3rd Edition D&D rules, Fighters are given a 4th attack at Level 16 (might be 18 not sure, haven't got my rulebook here) but the way it is implemented is that the first attack has the greatest bonus and then each attack after that becomes gradually weaker, implementing something like this into EQ would be quite possible. What I propose is that a Third Attack skill becomes available at Level 40 (or at Level 35 by replacing the Disarm skill) and then a Fourth Attack skill is given at Level 60. Having these extra attacks will help Warriors tremendously in keeping mobs onto us, yes it will make us more powerful but the sliding damage/attack bonus for each attack would lessen this effect.<P>I would hazard to say to give Monks, Paladins and Shadow Knights a Third Attack too sometime during their career (but not Thieves, by their very nature they are not suppose to be fighters) but never a fourth attack.<P>From my point of view, this would be the best way to make us as Warriors be able to 'taunt' effectively and do our job properly.<P>Kullnan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000458-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000458.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000458-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000458-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000458-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum13&number=13&thisthread=000458&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum13&number=13&thisthread=000458&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
