</FONT><HR>Since a big problem of having pets is pathing, which is a technological problem.  And the ultimate goal is to have a pet that in theory stays close to its master for example a 15 meter range.  This can be solved and I don't think it will make balance worse just better.  Remove the aggro range for a pet that is not in combat.<P>  For example: You summon a pet in a dungeon or even just a hallway then you take one step forward.  Then due to a pathing bug the pet goes down the hall around the bend... and aggros half of the dungeon.  Well removing the aggro from the pet would solve this problem.  The pet would just wander off and you wouldn't have to worry about it being attacked.  Then you could recall the pet to your position.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, i want my old group role back and the abillity to solo in the "new" worlds.<BR>Before i did hit 51 i was an damage machine, in a group with 2 warrs and a monk in SoLB and i just sit back and smile while my pet is adding the most melee damage in the combat. The item upgrades for the melee classes in Kunark increased there damage output by so much that im happy if my pet does 50% of the damage they do. Please look into the increase of pet power vs mobs in the expansion, you will find some silly figures there im pretty sure. Magician ARE the class with the most damage output before 51, even a rogue couldent come close with our PET/DS/DD. That was why we was group friendly, we made the group able to kill more in less time. Now im gonna solo in the old world (since Kunark and SoV mobs have a ton of HP's) for one more lvl so i can scribe the CoH i had to trade all i got to get and might be wanted in a group once again. Our dmg output is way to low for the encounters we need to fight in Kunark, SoV. WE DONT NEED ANY NEW ESCAPE SPELL LINES (root,stun,etc), we need our damage back, if you increase the pets to what they once was (i mean pets dmg/hp vs Mob dmg/hp) im pretty sure all mages will be happy and wanted in groups again. The DD's should be looked into aswell, i think the wizards need something done here too.<P>Give me my role back!<BR>I was enjoying my magician until i lost my status as THE dmg dealing class.<P>/raise <BR>got a Warr and Cleric going as twinks now<P>/Zelar<BR>54 Magician </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I cannot belive that Alan thinks we are balanced.  Please play a mage past level 50, then see if you agree with your own statement.  Ever since Kunark came out, the mage class got demolished past 50.  The only thing anyone cares about in a mage os CoH.  Pets are too weak and we can no longer solo effectively (not even going to velious, some greens had kill my pet rather quickly).  Some gripes:<P>1. 50+ damage spells do not keep up with the difficulty of MOBs and are no more efficient.  Making rains less resistable and taking pet out of the picture will help.  The DOT spell has to do more damage than a shock of the same mana cost (DOTs always do more damage for the mane due to over time effect).  We need bigger nukes, almost as much as wizards (they get snare, root, evac, port, etc)<BR>2. 50+ pets are not much stronger than level 49 pets.  Not much to say here, the pet power levels at 49 and with Kunark/Velious mobs, the pets cannot keep up.<BR>3. 52, 58  fire pet is as useless as it gets, cannot find a situation when I like using it, even on very low greens 49 fire is way better.<BR>4. Out of the 10 or so weapon summons, I have yet to use anything other than fang and SoR.  Even newbies don't want the 2HB staffs at level 1, they would rather get a worn great staff.  Make us summon more types of weapons with different procs (remember these are no-rent items).  Make them weapons that people will WANT not take out of pity for us.  We need proc against undead, fire, cold, summoned, etc.  We need summoned weapons that people will want to use and will want us in groups to summon them. People pay for sow, clarity, port...we have nothing worth selling.<BR>5. Spell drops are way too rare forcing spell prices to be unreachable for any mage who is not in a strong guild.  Vocerate water costs 10kpp, Call Of Hero costs 5kpp on my server, I will never see them probably.<BR>6. There is NO useful mage only equipment, we get items with our own spells (most of which are reclaim energy, enough with this spell damnit!  I have 6 items with reclaim energy, have you guys run out of creativity?).  Other classes get many of our spells in their items, we get the All/All items.<BR>7. Did I mention we are not needed in groups after 50 (unless on a rare case someone needs a fire immune elemental for the boss mob like Rak'Ashiir or Ixblat Fer?)  We need more creative spells in our lineup.  CoH should be level 50 and a group version of CoH (summons the entire group) should be 56.  There is more, but nothing that has not been asked in every other post.<BR>8. Pet control spells are needed and since test got pet speed spell and pet summon spell, it's a good step.  We need an upgrade to renew elements (maybe a CH pet only).<BR>9. Travel and escape spells, we have NONE!  Gate is not an escape spell.  Since pathing is so bad in many dungeons and we do not have improved invisibilty, if in a dungeon our invis drops we are pretty much dead unless gate does not get interrupted.  I never understood why we did not get improved invis when wizards got invis to undead.<BR>A. Phanton line uses 4 cat's eye agates... Tis makes the spell tough to use in long raids.  Please upgrade it to use a more expensive component.  And what is the brain dead idea of using lapis lazuli in the teens and reverting back to malachite?!<BR>B. We need increased drop rates on elemental staffs, simple.<P>This is in addition to many other valid concerns voiced here.  I don't expect earth shttering changes, but we need help after 50.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The pet is level 49... not a pet from the level 49 spells, the pet IS level 49. The pet hits for 67 damage, has a proc that can go off on every attack and casts a stun spell. The pet also has a damage shield that does alot of damage.<P>The epic pet adds about the same ammount of power to the mage class that Ragebringer adds to rogues, it is a shame that the mage epic is so much harder to obtain.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>- Add in Cold Based spells into our arsenal of Damage spells. Make them approximately 5 levels higher than the previous Fire Based Spell but keep them at the same damage level. Hell you could even start them off at the same damage as the previous spell, and then incriment the damage per level at the same rate as the previous one did. Just give us a bit more variety. This would make Mages a bit more useful on Nagafen and Talendor Raids. As it is we can't do anything at all (pets get feared).<P>- Power of Pets post 50 is rediculous. After the patch to make Pets Duel Wield and making them Pets instead of NPCs, I have noticed a substantial decrease in their power. Add that to the fact that the 49 pet costs 200 mana, maxes for 56 (earth pet), and has ~2500 HPs, and then the next upgrade (for earth) costs 300 mana, maxes for 58, and has ~2600 HPs. Umm, we get an additional 2 damage and ~100 HPs for 100 more mana? How is this "balanced"? At the very least lower the mana cost back to 200. Or increase the Max damage by 4 and add 500 HPs. If a Mages pet is his focus of Power, then as it stands we have less power at 60 when compared to others at 60, while when the cap was 50 we were among the more powerful classes available.<P>- Malo-line spells. The main idea behind this series of spells is to lower overall resists. Well being Magic Based it is useless against things that are of High MR. We get an Unresistable one of these at level 60, but by then it's too late to be overly useful. Please add in another version of this spell at or around level 53 that is Lure-Based. Make it Double the Mana cost of the level 51 version, and take off 20 points of Resists, making it -40 instead of -60. Upgrade the Mala spell (level 60) to take off -40 instead of -35 but leave it as is in the case of Casting Time and mana cost.<P>- Magician Spells being given out like Candy to other classes.<P>You yourself said the following: "DESCRIPTION: Perhaps there is a story reason for giving bards the ability to turn into werewolves. But we should be very careful when we give the more class defining abilities to other classes. The ability to look like a werewolf is the signature illusion for enchanters. Even if we don’t remove this lute, we most certainly should think twice before giving such abilities to classes in the future."<P>Here is a list of some Magician Abilities given to other classes:<BR>Summon Arrows (Level 29 summon) - Tolan's Darkwood Bacer<BR>Pouch of Quellious (Level 55 summon) - Silver Moon Wrist Wraps<BR>Eye of Zomm (Level 8 summon) - Singing Steel Helm<BR>Shield of Flame (Level 20 Damage Shield) - Singing Steel Bracer<BR>Summon Throwing Dagger (Level 16 Summon) - Mrylokar's Bracer<P>And this is but a few. The big one there is the level 55 spell being on a mildly common drop from Plane of Growth (not to mention the ability to be quested for via Velious Armor quests). If you are going to go ahead and do that to us, then give us that spell on a vendor. As it is, I have not seen in yet, and this is from about 5 eight hour Jugg Raids, and countless hours in Skyfire. If you worried about Enchanter Illusion Spells being given out then at the same time worry about Magician Summon Spells being given out. It's only the right thing to do.<P>- Resist Rates on Rain Spells. <P>A scenario: Single pull Sea Fury. I sic my pet on him and let him build up a little aggro. I decide to use a rain spell so I Malosi. I then cast the Rain spell. Wave 1: RESIST. Wave 2: FULL DAMAGE. Wave 3: PARTIAL DAMAGE. I nuke twice, FULL DAMAGE on both. I cast Rain spell again. Wave 1: RESIST. Wave 2: RESIST. Wave 3: PARTIAL RESIST.<P>You see a pattern? I could spend a day in OOT hunting Seafuries for you and log all my Rain Spell Damage if you want. And let's not forget that the Seafury could move out of the way, virtually negating 1 or even 2 waves. Whereas if I decided to use just straight DDs then I would almost never get resisted after casting Malosi (95% of the hits are Full damage. 4% are partial. 1% is Full Resist).<P>- Call of the Hero. I think an upgrade should exist, and that the current version should be scaled to level 52. The Upgrade should be level 56. For the Upgrade it should have the ability to summon group members across Zonelines. Make the component cost 4-5X the cost of the first. Double the Mana cost. Make it so that Mages would only use this spell on things like Complete Group Wipeouts. Make the Recast time like 5 mins or so. Adding all that into it would offset it's power. Moving the first one to level 52 would insure that many more mages would be able to get groups. If your focus here is to increase the viabilty of classes in a group, doing this would be enough for plenty of mages.<P>- Elemental Armor Series. We get the first spell at level 20. It gives +20 to Fire and Cold resist. The upgrade is 24 levels later. It gives +30 to Fire and Cold resist. No other Upgrade exists. This seems a little but much for a good series of spells. Magicians command the Elements so they should get protection of sorts from them, but ony 2 spells in the series, 24 levels apart and only a measly +10 to both resists is a joke. Move the Elemental Armor (level 44) spell to level 34. Make an Upgrade at level 49 that gives +40 to both resists. Make another upgrade at level 55-57 that adds +50 to both resists. Make it so other Resist spells that offer less of a resistance rate do not overwrite it.<P>Add in a counter line that gives us the ability to bestow this type of spell on others, at a higher mana cost and reduced resist. Like +20 FR and CR for 100 mana at level 29. +30 FR and CR for 200 mana at level 44. +40 FR and CR for 400 mana at level 54.<P>This is not an unreasonable request given that Druids and Clerics get a similar line of Resist Specific spells, both that are targettable and, in the case of Druids post 50, which adds it to the entire Group.<P>- Modulation Rod. Good spell. I have my own version of crack (clarity) to give people. Too bad it's useless to me. Make an upgrade that adds in an additional Charge at level 57 or so.<P>- Mana Regen. If anything add in a quest at around the level 49 level (make part of it Planar specific so only 46+ can complete) that would get us a Magician Specific Robe that had virtually no stats (About the same as an Oracle Robe) and Effect: Summon Modulation Rod. Make the cast time like 20 seconds. This in itself would be a form of Mana regen, and it would be specific to Mages above level 46 so it wouldn't be as overpowered as people would think it is, especially given such a long cast time.<P>- Magician Epic. I know you said no Epic item discussion on here but I have to add this. At 500 mana this thing is a pain to summon. What increases the frustration is the fact that even after summoning it we have to wait 20 seconds for our Pet to arrive. This is obviously an oversight. If we have to spend the time to cast it, that should be enough. All the other Right-Click Epics take less overall time to summon and in some cases can be done twice in the time it takes a mage to Summon, Equip, and Right Click, then wait for the pet to arrive. Make the Right-Click instant cast.<P>That is it. Thank you for your time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I will agree with you that there is very little overall that is wrong with the balance of this class....pre-50 anyways. Post 50 is a different matter. For one thing our 50+ spells are rather bland and unexciting for the most part. Summon Booze and fireworks? Summon a bag full of arrows. Uh...yay? Mages are not always welcome either, as you state, because of their pets. In fact there are instances where a Mage's pet is specifically prohibited(Hate for example). The reason is usually terrible pathing and aggro problems. Without the pet the Mage is a poor second to a Wizard although can still be useful to the group because of damage shields, dispels, and Malise. In fact the only time a Mage is considered essential to a group is one that has Call of the Hero. It is for that one spell alone that Magicians are invited into a group. You state that we're all the more welcome because of the Malise line....not if it gets resisted all the time. I can't use it in Hate at all at level 52. This is a minor complaint though. Let's address some other issues.<P>Fear: Yes, pets get feared and run. I don't find this a problem. I take preventative measures against this by having someone cast Magic Resist buffs on the pet. I keep a focus item with Reclaim Energy Handy to desummon it if it gets feared. If it's out of range of the focus item I use the effect on Earthen Boots. Pet gone...no more problem. Resummon it and send the new one in again. I don't see the need for any anti-fear buff that is castable by mages.<P>No Rent Items/LD: Doesn't bother me...much.<P>Rain Spells: I find that they are too mana inefficient for the damage they do, especially since I am almost guaranteed to have at least one wave resisted...and more often than not multiple waves resisted. An extra wave as well as tuning the resist rates a bit would help. Resists on this seem to usually be all or nothing. Very rarely do the waves ever hit for partial damage. <P>Summoned Procing Weapons: We had a summoned weapon that procced for a very long time. We got used to it. Then you took it away. Yes we can still summon it but it's not practical or useful anywhere outside the Hole. The idea of being able to equip pets with weapons is very intriguing to me. I'd like to see more weapons that are pet only with procs on them. Stuns, DD spells, Self Haste, Malise, Fear, Renew Elements, etc. I'd also like to be able to equip my elementals with 2 handed weapons please. The 50+ spells are pretty barren of any useful summons spells. This would largely solve that issue. Don't tell me Summoning arrows or shurikens are useful. It's convenient but hardly anything worth getting excited about.<P>Pathing: Needs improvment. 'Nuff said.<P>50+ Fire pets: I recently acquired this spell so I was able to finally get some first-hand experience with it. Yes, it's very situational. No, they can't out-tank the 49 firepet. Damage output is less overall than the 49 pets and it really isn't useful when soloing. Was it intended the 50+ firepets do less damage than the 49 pets? Anyways, what they do well is interrupt casters. I love this pet...just wish it wouldn't move into melee range immediately. Can you make it so the 50+ fire-pets hang back and cast until something moves in to melee with them or attacks the caster?<P>Spell Drops: I like the idea. I hate the implementation. They're far too rare and too random. I can spend hours killing monsters that are supposed to drop spells and only see 2 or 3 if I'm lucky. Some areas are better than others true. What's worse is the spells that drop aren't likely to be ones I can use. It would alleviate some of the frustration if I knew the mobs were going to be dropping ONLY spells for my particular class. Either increase the drop rates quite a bit or else have mob X only drop class X's spells. That way it sitll takes time to get the spells but I know if I stay there long enough I will come away with something for my effort that I can actually use!<P>DoT's: I love em. Yeah, they aren't the most mana efficient but they're something different...if they aren't resisted they do full damage. They don't generate the aggro a full nuke would either. <P>High level Pet Healing: As much as I'd like it I'd have to say no. It would make Magicians too powerful.<P>Beneficial Buffs: Sometimes I get beneficial buffs cast on me by well meaning players...for example clerics, that overwrite my own or I simply don't want...but can't remove them! I should always be allowed to remove benefical buffs.<P><BR>There have been a LOT of other really good suggestion given which, unfortunately, I did not write down. I hope you've been taking notes. There are other issues on my mind but those have largely been discussed already.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057784-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057784.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057784-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057784-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057784-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057784&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057784&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
