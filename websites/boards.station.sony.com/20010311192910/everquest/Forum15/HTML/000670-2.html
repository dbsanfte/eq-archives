</FONT><HR>You guys must all be bluebies. It would be really fun to have the disarm cap raised for PVP. the current cap doesnt work at all at lvl 40 when we get it, and even less though it seems at lvl 50 now that ive reached it. i dont think it should be up to par with warrior, monk and rougue disarm but id like to think there was actually a chance id be able to disarm someone when theres a rougue and a ranger happily pounding away on me. Also what makes everyone so convinced that an SK is a defensive class? We get necro spells, and a necro is an offensive class. Paladins get cleric spells- your a moron if you dont think clerics are a defensive class. We need to be able to dish out more dmg IMHO not be able to absorb more of it. what do you think lifetaps, shadowstep, and fieng death are for? to kep from dying thats what shadowknights are not the brave selfless warriors that paladins are this is a roleplaying game start playing your role and quit asking for a piece of everyone elses.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>hi absor, <P>just writing to let you know that the most important issue for SKs at least for the lvl 55 players ( and most had to reach 60 without the "unnerfed" xp curve ), is the ability to contribute in uber mob encounters. Uber mob now means just about the vast range of yard trash in velious. <P>The defensive and parry raise do help us and we thank you for thinking of improving us, but in the end without a proper discipline we cannot tank such mobs. Why tank? because verant has envisioned us as a defensive tank with some offensive spells. But take away the offensive spells and you get a defensive tank with low melee potential . We can taunt, taunt is fine but that is no use to us if we cannot tank. Defensive skill and AC incrrrease will help us abit but without a discipline for those 5-20 minute encounters this is little use to us.<P>We have a low melee potential against mobs of equal or higher lvl , our spells are unused for majority of encounters just like many of the casters in the game. BUT our spells are 10-25 lvls lower .<P>Spells are not what we want in such encounters, we just want to be able to contribute as much as a warrior. Unfortunately your game designers has made melee as the only option in such encounters. Which is why we are asking for an increase in our melee tanking and damage capabilities and the disciplines to allow us to function as the tank ( since damage dealer seems to be for the ranger ). The problem is that to be able to tank effectively a tank has to be able to deal melee damage effectively as well...<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>For the love of god, don't touch summon corpse.<P>All role playing issues aside, the easiest spells to not have to worry about when it comes to balance are the utility spells.  For some reason, a number of fellow sks seem to feel that they should be damaging their opponents with spells.<P>If that was the case, they should have chosen necros, imao.  Spells are for torturing yer enemy to the sk.<P>My opinions about our spell lineup.<P>We whack things.  We torture things.  We debuff things in a manner that makes us stronger.  The only reason I find palatable for us to have the life tap line at ALL is the life gain utility, not the damage output.  The ac reduction of heart flutter and asystole make sense to me.  The snaring of the darkness line makes sense to me.  The outright damage of the heat blood line makes no sense to me.  If there was a new line of spell I'd like to see, it would be one which cost my party hp and increased my attack based on how many hp my party took.  Sacrificing ones friends for personal glory makes all sorts of sense to the sk in me.  (an exact implementation of that would be, for instance, a 20 point non-stackable stamina debuff to target player in group for a 20 point stackable attack increase to self.  Numbers would have to be adjusted for balance, of course.)<BR>Another spell I could see would be "Soulbond" where you target a player in group who takes all melee damage you sustain while the spell is up.<P>Feign death is a class defining spell.  As is gather shadows and invis to undead.  Summon corpse is a MAJOR utility spell, as in you can save someone elses game who thought all was lost.  Shadowknights who don't realize the role play value of someone owing you their livelyhood...well, lets just say that it lets you play more dangerously.  <P>Everything else.....whatever...it would be nice to not get laughed out of my guild when I suggest that I tank an ubermob.<P>About pets...if there is one way to help them out in a group friendly manner, give us a pet buff which increases their odds to succussfully land a bash on a mob.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor and Company,<P>  All  tho I do feel that some Changes are in order for the Shadow Knight, I dont totaly agree on  everything I have been reading. Let  me take a moment to  give my experiences on the bertoxx server. Yes I realise  some  of these have been covered and  or taken care of but here they  are anyways.<P>I  currently play a lvl 45 SK  on bertoxx. I wore Banded armor till I was  big enuff to hit Cazic Thule to begin my quests  for the  greatly saught  Dark Forge.  I do have to say that  by the time you manage to get all the decayed pieces from crusaders, you are already planning on getting better  gear from somewhere else.  This  armor isnt hard to get, it just takes forever.  I went from  lvl 29  to lvl  36 getting my suit if that gives  any idea how long it took. <P>I havent tried to yet  but  from what i hear on my server and  these msg boards  is that if we kill stuff in Sebilis, Karnors and a few other places  we become KOS. Well  We DO support Innoruks Ideals  but my questions is, Why should we take a faction hit  for it when  we  defend or retaliate?  I dont expect Innoruk  to give me  flowers when I see him but if he can kill us with no penalties, then  Why cant  we kill  the stuff we need to kill without taking the faction hit. <BR>*just my opinion tho* I do feel it does give  us DE's a bad  rep by asking  all these goodies out  here  to give us a hand couse we  cant kill something  couse  we wont be able to get  into the evil city afterwards.  <P>As  for the 2 hand weapons.  I got no problem using  em.  After baking  tons of  goods and selling them I finaly  got my  Dark Reaver at lvl 20 and have been using it  ever since.  Now the highest single  hit at lvl 45  ive seen  is  80 points.  In my honest opinion  theres  weapons  all over the place its just a matter of getting  it and using it  to your  advantage.  <P>The bash I  havent used my  1hand slash  or bash skill  since I got my reaver becouse at level 20  I  failed in finding a  1 hand slash  weapon  I could aquire at lvl  that did  as much dammage as the reaver or  swqung faster  to equal it  out. so  those skills  are lacking. <P>As for the Pets. I have to  say  at  lower levels they  kinda come in handy.  from  30  to 40 they worked  great using the fear/kite tactic.  So if ya  want to  be pure hack and slash  no spells.   dont  bring  a pet it wont last at higher levels.<BR>Although I do agree the Sk pets should be  modified   for better lasting power.  Im  a great  fan of  getting into groups and  trying to  solo  still even  at higher lvls. <P>as for  the spells.   some of em need work<P>I use heat blood, Life tap, fear,  Engulf darkness, shadow vortex and shield skin. <P>I think the spells  are fine  but then again im not a hack and slash  quake  powergamer either. * no offence meant to anyone*<P>Here is what I feel is wrong, or questions.<P>the epic quests.<BR>How come the  epic for clerics  get lvl 30 mobs to kill?<P>the sks  get  lvl  50 +  mobs?<P>and   the mages  have to aquire a item  that only  drops 1 time  every  6 months?<P>no in my  opinion  that should be fixed.  All the  epics should be equally  dificult to get. <P>IF  we sks  are made to more defensive or  tankish  like the warrior.  then what  reason is  there for becoming or making a warrior?  Why not become a hybrid  and get the  effects of a warrior with spells, true?<P><BR>the idea  is  to use what is givin   to us to our advantage. Not  to  get  the  the stuff changed to the point where  all ya go do is have a  powergaming hack and slash  group  and you can get anything. <P>I am having fun with   the sk  just  the way it is , so what if I gota work a litte harder becouse my  spells are weaker and I  dont like my  lame  pet.  BUT  hey I still use   em to my advantage when i can. <P>I had  some  points when i started this  but seemed  to have lost em so ill end  it now. Start slammin me if ya want to  ;ppp<P>IF  ya want to get  stuff  fixed.  here  are a few  issues.<P>1) the overcrowding  of  some server  where you have to wait  till under 2500  on it  before it lets you in, Like bertoxx.<P>2)  like  when  you  go to hit  assist and it targets  the critter and it tells you , you cant  hit it. and its RIGHT IN  FRONT OF YOU . <P>3) or other bugs that should be adressed.  <P>anyhows..<P>Axe high and ill cyas all in game. <P>Tojamn<BR>45 Shadow Knight<BR>Bertoxx..<P>( wait  maybe i shoulda been anon  so i wouldnt get slammed  hehehe)<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It is my experience that shadowknights are at the peak of their prowess in the mid 40's. However at these levels one's skill caps reach their maximum and even though the mobs get higher, we do not have the innate skills to match them, so by the time you hit the 50's you are still meleeing as well as you did in your low 40's but against mobs that hit harder and have more hpoints.<P>Go to any of the planes or high level zones and you will find that your weapon barely connects, in fact you will feel like a lv1 sk endlessly missing with your practise sword.<P>At 49 we get nice fear/dark/pet upgrades which makes soloing blues viable; but soloing is a lonely life and I'm sure we'd all much rather be in groups. Trouble is what we can contribute to a group is not enough to warrant them taking us in over a warrior/rogue/monk etc., which are much more group friendly classes who can contribute in tangible ways.<P>Tryst</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Man, would you guys quit whining about summon corpse and just be glad we got something to the equivilant of the pally rez. Man, I was overjoyed to hear that we got this spell. No, it isnt the best of spells, but it sure beats having to run through the zone to locate your corpse and drag it back to the zone to loot it if there is no cleric available for a rez. And, yes it would increase your chance of going on a raid, IF no necros were available to participate. I expect other classes to shout nerf SK's, but not the SK class itself. Vernat gave us something good, but you had to complain that it wasnt as good as a nerco's so know they might remove. How short sighted can you be? Why not just ask them to remove harm touch because it isn't as powerfull as ice comet. <P>/shakes his head in utter disgust</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>/boggle some of the stuff on that list<P>Voice graft? umm why even waste time talking about this<P>Arhcery? please ignore the lvl 25 Sks that brought this up, archery is useless for almost everyone post 50 except rangers, and that is fine by me.  our post 50 concerns have nothing to do with archery its a waste of time to bring this up with the live team, archery is a waste of a good range slot and any SK that is worried about archery isnt playing the class correctly.<P><BR>Lifeleach.  - correct it cost 3000pp to do, which is absurd for a lvl 50 SK, not to mention you have to turn in a white gold necklace., which is a VERY nice resist item that is a rare drop in guk, and that piece alone made me hunt and try and buy it for months, I have finally completeed my quest for a lvl 50 spell at lvl 55, there is NO way you can solo the mob that spawns he resists all fears and has a super high magic resist, although a shaman might be able to solo him, a SK could NEVER do this quest solo with a full group of 50+ the zombie is still a ver tough fight unless you have a mage/shaman 55+ then it is much easier.  But why should a lvl 50 spell quest from the old world (non kunark) require lvl 55+ people to kill the mob?  Oh well the money sink got my 3k and I got mylifeleech, but i feel bad for all these lvl 50 SKs that think they are going to have an easy time of it<P>The way to fix lifetaps is just make lifeleech do more drain/heal per lvl after 50. so 280 at 50 310 at 51 340 at 52....<P>also a 2 min recast time is a little excessive, i mean 280 pts is not a whole lot after lvl 51 and a 2 min recast time means a wasted spell slot for 90% of fights<P>Improved pets? maybe a pet haste buff like on test, other than that pets are fine, a minor dot for SKs mostly when soloing (which i never do past lvl 55)<P>Sheild procs? i like the increased AC idea better<P>Bash cap and taunt cap ..good idea<P>Defense cap increase - Best thing on the list<P>Disease cloud- actually disease cloud does 5pts DD and cuts regen in 1/2 of so.  Not sure what a high lvl disease spell would/should do. maybe an Area affect disease that negates any mob regen? <P>Evocation line? why bother, ward undead spells have such a long cast time that they arent worth casting at any lvl </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Like many others, this list disappoints me.<P>ShadowKnights just can't do enough damage and the idea that we are a defensive class is a joke. At present, our AC/HP aren't anywhere near where they need to be to be considered a defensive foundation for a group. We may be able to tank well in a typical XP group, but as I close in on 60 that seems less important.<P>I use a Noct Blade and I've been watching some of my brothers use IC lately, and I'm in no rush to trade in my shield for my epic. The stats look great on paper, but when I watch the sword in action it makes me wonder.<P>When my guild raids Trak, VS and various other dragons, I tend to offer to play a friends monk instead of my SK. Why? My SK does around 250-350 dmg against Trak in about 60 seconds. The monk does closer to 2k.<P>How do we fix the class? I'm not sure. SKs are great for XP groups when their job is to keep the mobs off of rangers, rogues and monks (even though most of the monks in my guild have higher AC than me). Whenever I raid, my job becomes much less defined. Hell, I'd take a warrior, monk, rogue or ever a ranger (if we lacked damage ability) over myself.<P>-Adding AC is a great idea. It will help.<P>-Adding HP is a great idea. It would allow us a lot more power in SoV.<P>-Find someway too increase our damage output. Our spells are good for mega-taunts, but compared to warriors/rogues/monks/rangers, there is no possible way we can compete.<P>-Give us a niche in epic fights. You gave rangers the gift of reposite /di. Warriors have an awesome defensive /di. We have nothing.<P>-Improve IC. I've heard many great stories about how hard it hits for ogres/trolls, but most of us don't play those races. The disparity between human and troll warriors isn't even as close as between the human SK and the TSK.<P>-Come up with something. =) I remember in early 1999 I started my SK, and someone told me to give up on him. I still remember the words he told me... "they should kick ass, but somewhere in develop they just didn't work out." I still remember the Boil Blood nerf... how Verant could have nerfed SKs is beyond me.<P>But hell, at least I'm not a paladin. I've enjoyed my SK for over 18 months now, but as I near 60 I'm really not sure what to do with him. My troll warrior twink is doing well, however. =D<P>57 Revenant<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>-Dr:  I disagree with you on a couple points there, archery for an SK can be useful at times, I have a Skydarkener for my bow and I actually use it a decent amount in certain circumstances, not to mention the fact that its great for pulling (better than spells often).  Lifeleech quest is easy, any SK can do the entire quest in a day, its also something thats designed for multiple groups of 50's (think it took me 18 to do it when it first came out), its also the best tap you have until 57 even with the recast. Disease Cloud, how can people that are 50+ not even know what the simplest spell they have does? 10 mana 5dd+1 dmg a tick for 5 min (55 dmg)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hello, I play a level 52 SK on the prexus server and here are some of my thoughts.<P><BR>ITEM: Better Shield Stuns.<BR>Great idea, for example fighting the trents in POG<BR>which gate towards the end of their health and other similiar mobs, because as of now I seldom get a stun off on a high level mob, and boy do you want to stun them when they are gating )<P>ITEM: Shield-based discipline.<BR>Great idea, if it would be implemented right be able to tank an uber mob, again in Pog when you get hit for 750 damage with one hit you are not going to last long..i.e get hit.hit.hit try to feign or you just die. Also let it effect the 2hs swords that have bash as they were weilding a sword at that time.<P>ITEM: Taunt. <BR>Great idea..I agree we are the best taunters but what about the mobs that are immune to disease cloud etc ..what are we going to do then with out a higher taunt.<P>ITEM: Archery.<BR>Great idea...for pulling...it has its place at the right time as you can pull mobs better with a lower agro range effecting the other mobs and there are good bows out there..and hopefully more to find<BR>Double Recurve Velium Bow<BR>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM <BR>Skill: Bow  Atk Delay: 37<BR>DMG: 30<BR>WT: 2.0  Range: 130<BR>Class: WAR, PAL, RNG, SHD, ROG<BR>Race: ALL<P><BR>ITEM: Summon Corpse.<BR>Please leave it..im my guild we have just a few necros and a few sk's on raids many times its just us 2 Sk's ...and at times our spell is needed and if we did not have the spell..would mean a lot of wasted time finding and getting a necro. Besides the necro's get to carry the stacked coffins..Sk's can carry one coffin per slot.<P>ITEM: Grim Aura.<BR>Many Sk's say why do we need it...well at lower levels this will help and 5atk is 5atk you did not have before.<P>ITEM: Disease/poison spells<BR>agree one of my most used spells is disease cloud/and posion based spells would just add to the role playing atmosphere.<P>ITEM: Shield Procs.<BR>Really Really want this...it would help out a bit with our offesive ability and make that 12 damage which we hit with bash a little more exciting.<P>well those are the items i had comments on as other posters posted my opinion on other parts of your post..<P>thanks in advance<BR>Redstorm<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor I think this sums up what experienced shadowknights feel.<P>"An amazing list Absor generated of things to change *without* improving the balance of the SK class. Yes, with 252 archery SKs will suddenly become...ummm...become..well, I can't think of any impact this change would have. But once we have grim aura, whoa! Watch out! We will see 'group looking for SK' in ooc and 'we need more SKs for the raid' in guildsay. <P>My 2cp are this: Everyone who spent time saying we are not balanced until we have xxxxxx, and then generated a Christmas list of wants rather than needs really diluted the whole discussion. The idea that we need some special illusion to be balanced is absurd. If you think for a second that a well played SK isn't an assent to your group I would highly recommend you re-think how you use your skills. The areas where a SK has trouble no matter how they use their skills are in the area of uber-mobs and large raids. Here the specialists (warrior, cleric, rogue) are all that is needed. Here is where attention should have been focused. <P>Failure to read instructions I guess. 'Class balance', 'not things that would be neat to have' was the original subject. I am deeply dissappointed that real issues got buried and the whole thread turned into nothing more than childern at a toy store before Christmas. All this accomplished was to allow Verant an easy out to addressing the real issues by giving them ducks to shoot. <P>mt 2cp on real issues: <BR>1) Offensive skill caps, too low to do effective melee damage on even con mobs and better post 50. <P>2) Defensive skill caps, too low only because the bar was raised with rogues having warrior defense caps. <P>3) Discipline that mitigates damage for the all too common mobs that hit for 300+ and cannot be slowed (Lower Sebilis, Siren's Grotto, Sky, , , etc.). <P>4) All pre-50 lifetaps are way too little too late and cost too much to ever be effective. Post 50 they cast too long. <P>Things like the bash cap is something that is nice and can be validly argued why we should have a higher one, but really, if you had to choose only 4 items that *need* improvement to balance the SK class in EQ after Velious, is this one of them that will make a difference? <P>Overall, after seeing Absor's list my response is dissappointment. <P><BR>__________________<P><BR>Dakker Turambar<P>Teaching the power of Hate, one soul at a time."<P>I reposted this from another forum.

The improved FD is a great spell, but it should really be available at a lower level.  /begs<P>=================<BR>Questions:<BR>=================<BR>1. Why are warriors allowed to be the best at offense and at defense, they get all sorts of uber mob useful disciplines, yet still find a way to get experience bonuses?<P>2. Why SK's and Palandin spells are basically useless in most cases?  The only spells I ever get to use are used only for taunt value. The only other spells I use drain too little and cost too much mana.  Can you give us some really strong group usable / uber mob usable spells or disciplines? <P>3. Why do our spells need to cost more mana, come at a higher level, have a higher cast time and have a lesser effect? The only valid point I see here would be to get the spells at a higher level then necros would.

Sure a tanking DISC. would be great and sorely needed, but that does start to infringe on warriors.  IF we have the unique ability to stun these types mobs, even for spell casting, to a significant degree then all of the sudden we have that desired element for these types of encounters.  How to balance that without making the encounters too easy will be the challenge.<P>not the list i would have generated, but then you would have a different list for every person who made one i am willing to bet.

</FONT><HR>How about this spell at level 52: Servant of Unholy Darkness<BR>This self-only spell would give +5 SV Magic, Fire, Cold and +10 SV Disease and Poison.  The spell would give +20AC and +30 ATK Bonus with +15Str, +15 Sta and -15Cha.  This spell will also give the effect Illusions: Skeleton (probably Dread Skeleton) Finally, the drawback to the spell should be 3point DoT.  Not too much to actually hurt but enough to be an annoyance. However, I know Verant has stacking issues with DoT and regens.  So if there is a problem then let it drain Sta instead. I wanted to put in a haste too but by level 52 you will most likely be grouped with an enchanter and than this spell couldn’t stack.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, <P>Unfortunately I did not read the early parts of the SK discussion, but starting at part Five, I read many wonderful posts that sounded like perfect ideas for balancing the class.<P>I appreciate the time you took in creating these discussions, and making these lists, but I feel that this list really falls short in BALANCING our class.<P>As I said above, I read many fine posts with great ideas, but none of these ideas seemed to even get mentioned in your list.  To be honest, and not disrepectful at all, your list has many things in it that I would have never asked for, because they don't fit into what I believe, and what it seems to me, many other SK's believe, to be the way our class is designed.<P>I do not feel we should be a defensive class.  We should bring the pain and hate and disease and fear of our respective gods.  We should bring death on all who oppose us, and if we should happen to die in the meantime, so be it.<P>Give us offense.  There is no way we can ever do as much damage as a warrior, because we do not get dual wield or have the chance to crit hit.  Think about it.  A warrior can possibly dual wield, double attack with both hands, and crit with both weapons.  Massive damage.  <P>I do not want these ablilities, but do want to do more damage.  <P>I think our taunting ablility is fine, you just have to know how to make the mob mad.<P>We need to be better in the endgame.  We are fairly well balanced in the early to mid game.<P>Take a look at the first few posts on this thread, and then look at the last part of the SK discussion.  (Parts 5 and 6)  <P>If you do this, I believe you will get a better idea of what should be done to balance this class.<P>Lothorn Lightslayer<BR>Human Shadow Knight of the 32nd Rank<BR>In Servitude to Bertoxxulous<BR>Children of the Craft<BR>Prexus<P>P.S.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>The list is lacking what I think is the most important thing needed for High level players and that's something that allows us to contribute to the Uber Mobs.  <P>You've increased the difficulty of creatures in Velious, particularly boss mobs.  Because of the recent nerfs to manaless heal items it can be assumed that using fewer people and augmenting them with these items is not the way you want to go.  So the other route is to throw more people at the creature until it dies.  There is a problem with this though, Your system can't handle it.  You've shown us that we need numbers to overcome these creatures yet your system won't permit the numbers to gather in the same place.  So...in order to make the raid work, the organizers have to pick and choose what will be most effective in this case (what takes damage, what puts out damage, and what mitigates damage).  Those three roles are filled by the Warrior, Rogue, and Cleric respectively.  These creatures are pretty much what we have left to kill at this stage of the game (55+).  Shadow Knights aren't the only ones that don't fit in that equation.  You've made these creatures pretty much totally magic immune too, so what are the casters supposed to do?  You've basically increased the difficulty by making about half of the classes in the game largely ineffective.  I wouldn't be suprised if you were seeing some form of this complaint in nearly all of these class talk threads.<P>As to how we should contribute to these battles in a maner such that we can justify our lag inducing presence, we don't fit in to the damage mitigation category which leaves us with damage taking and damage dealing.  Ideally we should be a combination of both, but as you saw from logs posted earlier, our damage output is pretty low compared to the other classes.  As for damage taking, at this point and against a flurrying quad hitting creature our defensive capabilities are laughable.  Those two areas are the areas that need improvements though since those are the ones that fit into our class description.  But increasing our defense stat by a few points won't cut it.  Warriors who don't use their /defensive discipline aren't so much better off then we are when facing the likes of Velketor.  There's no reason to believe that this increase will be the solution to our problem when it already doesn't work on someone else who has higher parry, riposte, and dodge skills then we do, unless they use their discipline.  <P>Even though you've divided class abilities up into pieces that fall into categories like solo-ability and group-friendliness, I think when it all comes down to it (and it's all  coming down to it now), each class would like to have something significant they can contribute in most all situations.  At this stage of the game, most all situations = Multi-group encounters against named HIGH level creatures that drop some amazing items.  Shadow Knights (and many other classes) just aren't viable when it comes to these encounters.  We hinder more than we help.  Clerics are pretty much better off saving their mana for the Warriors and Rogues.  And for the sake of the actual battle participants, it would be better if we didn't go as the additional server lag caused by our presence can cost significant contributors their lives, and doom the assault.<P>The flagship SK ability, Harm Touch, isn't effective.  It's resisted on most all of these creatures.  We might be worthwhile as the cleanup wave or the initial suicide wave if we could land our HTs (Discipline enhanced or not) on these creatures, but we can't.<P>As to the other improvements suggested:<P>Shield skills - sounds pretty good, but I've got my epic weapon and I'm wondering do any of these apply to someone who's supposed to have the only weapon they could ever want?<P>Archery - personally not interested<P>Bash Cap increase - nice<P>Defensive and Parry Cap increase - not significant enough to overcome the problem elaborated on<P>Taunt - Upgrades to our ability to taunt are entirely un-necessary.  We have the tools to be the best taunters in the game.  If people can't taunt enough, they just aren't using these tools.<P>Pets - They're already fine in my opinion.<P>Casting Spells - I'll agree with another poster who indicated that we (hybrids) should be the kings of distracted casting.  By this I mean casting while having to deal with other things like swinging one's sword or dodging that giant's attack.<P>Lifeleech - the cost is fine<P>Summon Corpse - somewhat usefull<P>Voice Graft - rather not waste time on this item as it doesn't do anything to balance our class<P>Skeletal Illusion - see Voice Graft<P>DOT Style healing effects - The stacking issues need to be resolved.  We should never be asked to bag our EPIC weapon in favor of something else because of some incompatabilities with cleric spells. I worked my (and my guild's) butt off to get this sword, I shouldn't have to put it away for anything.  Since Soul Consumption will stack with Celestial Elixir if the CE is on first, I feel confident in saying there shouldn't be some programming limitation preventing this from occurring if the effects are applied in the opposite order.<P>The two most important things I want to get across with this response are the ineffectiveness of SKs in uber mob encounters and the stacking issues for DOT style healing agents.  We tank well against most creatures, but can't tank AT ALL against these upper level encounters.  The frequency with which these are tried (at the 55+ levels), and the significance of this experience to the gamer, require that each class have some role to play in the ACTUAL battle.  These small defensive changes aren't nearly enough as it stands currently.<P>Selenar Xllyveryn<BR>Shadow Knight of The Rathe<BR>Crusaders of Plilo<BR>www.raarcentral.com</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>See,I can deal with pathetic melee hits(by warrior/rogue standards),if I could see at level 50 or so my VE proc at the right amount,for example-that'd be what,62 points a hit and proc the right number of times(I'm lucky some days to get ONE proc off the casting at 30th. If this stuck like it should. I get procs of about 16hp right now at 30th. Should be closer to 42 if I was a necro,right?<BR> <BR>I see our lifetap line as a damage mitigation effect. But if we can't cast it,and it won't stick-does it matter that we have it? Yes,it reduces downtime. Great. But why can't we use most of our spells in direct combat,where we need them as tanks-especially at the highest levels?<BR> <BR>Yes,our spellcasting shouldn't be of the damage levels a comparable necro can deliver. But we SHOULD be able to deliver a spell at the same mana and damage effectiveness of a necro of our level,even if the spell in question is gained at a higher level by us. And because we are expected and needed to cast these in close combat,we should  have the speed and capacity to do so,and the expectation that we will get an effect when it's done.<BR> <BR>So yes,we can be called "defense" hybrids. We should be able to use our spells and physical stuns together to produce a tank that can hold a mob in place and keep the SK alive while doing so in a reasonable manner. Our combat ability in this form is NOT infinite,since it's limited by our mana capacity. We will never be able to lay down a barrage at full effectiveness against Velious mobs-but we will be able to do our share until mana burnout occurs. Further,because our full combat capacity is limited by mana,we will never out-offense or out-defense warriors in melee combat,but will be able to contribute in an effective manner without over-writing their efforts or that of pure casters,who have more mana and more potent spells to toss into the combat.<BR> <BR>That of course leads to discussing why high-level mobs have obscene MR/HP balancing towards straight melee encounters,but Absor has asked that to be another thread enitrely. I defer to his request.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

(But archary was right? LMAO) We constantly miss, and this is not just a high level problem, this is a very consistant problem throught our entire lives.  Since our damage done is overall nerfed, i think having a class that has the word Knight in the title, being able to at least hit their target is in order.  I saw nothing mentioned about the hideous drop rates of Decayed armor in CT. Alot of sk's just skip this quest altogether because it is a complete pain in the @$$. I remember when i was really young i looked so forward to doing that quest, and when i was of age to do it, the drop rates of the stuff made me decide to forget about it. You could spend all day in there and come away with basicly nothing.  How about the soul leech.. has anyone in VI tried to get this blade on a live server?? It is basicly impossible. These ommisions sacre me because it means that glaring flaws are being overlooked, and it is obvious VI has nottaken any steps to look into the SK class on their own.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> I've been reading these threads and others and this is the first comment I am making on the SK thread because my SK isn't yet 50. However, I feel this maybe the last chance to affect how the staff at Verant views SKs. A defensive Hybrid....***?? In one of the offical EQ guides SK are described as the most offensive class in the game for which they pay a large xp penalty. Then in these threads we are told SK are a defensive hybrid. Those two facts plus the fact that Absor said that there needs to be some give and take to balance the classes, leads me to the rest of this post.<BR>  Give me my xp penalty back and make me the offensive power house Verant's own guide to the Kunark expansion told me I would be.<BR>  Here is my take on the give and take that should take place. Keep your defensive cap increase...as a matter of fact go ahead and lower it to around 230 and lower the dodge and parry caps by a similar margin. And any spell that doesn't cause fear, do damage, or steal life or stats you can take those too.<BR>  In exchange I want a maxed out offensive skill 260ish if the game mechanices can handle it( yes higher then warriors), also a 10 to 15 point skill cap raise for all weapon skills, double attack, and repost, as well as a large increase to bash.<BR> Give us unwatered down lifetaps( including Vamp Embrace), more siphons( preferrable stackable ones that proc with long durations). Also more point blank AE DDs, actually replace the ward undead line with those. And maybe a couple AE lifetaps.<BR>  Also I would suggest 2 new lines of spells( actually 1 new line and one other spell). First a self only lifetap style damage shield with a decent duration. At ninth lvl it should tap 1pt and increase by 1pt per lvl( or maybe every other lvl) after that( as well as a duration increase up to say an hour or more a 60. Next a new spell line the only one we should get castable on others as it won't directly help them all that much and causes damage to mobs. A lifetap DS. High mana cost, long cast time, and duration shouldn't be more then say 15 mins or so a lvl 60. It should tap about half as effectively as the self only version.<BR>  As far as pets go I would only suggest 3 gameplay changes. One when a mob "cons" them the con message should be the same as if it had conned the master, so all them stinking greenies don't make us SKs mad and kill them. Two we tank for our pets not the other way around which means quite often they are behind the target....so let them backstab, with a fairly low skill cap for the pets lvl. And third and aggro the pet gets should be transfered to the master. A non-gameplay issue....a different graphic please.<BR> I would also like to see the apply poison skill added( but NOT the make poison skill), as rogues could make much cash that way I don't think they would mind too much, but I could be both wrong and asking for too much there.<BR>  If you make these changes no need to up the taunt skill as some suggested we will have way more then we can probably handle as is. Which means we might want to let us keep FD, and keep that as the ONLY way to reduce aggro. Not really reliable, takes mana, is interuptable, and with other considerations, but hey if you want to be the scaries Mofo around you got to take your chances.<BR> Also many comments were about ubermob fights, with the higher offense and weapon skills SK will hit more often and harder then anyone else except maybe warriors using a discipline and that combined with the lifetap DS should make SKs more useful in such encounters.<BR> Now as I said my SK isn't 50 yet( my main is btw) and I made 90%+ of my lvls before the xp penalty change, so I may well be full of it, espicially about the SK in ubermob fights and I am sure to get many many flames over some( or all of what I said) and everone who does flames me maybe right, but I am a ShadowKnight and I don't really care what people think of me...as long as they fear me.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't think you've quite contemplated what happens if we get all the offense without the defense.<BR> <BR>But,if you don't know what results,ask any 50+ or so ranger. Ubertaunt+ no defense= dead meleer.<BR> <BR>When it comes to tanking,defense beats offense,hands down. And if our offense is stealing HP and buffs from the opponent,so much the better for our lifespan in melee combat.<BR> <BR>We will NEVER get melee caps above a warrior's-the maximum the code can deliver is what warriors get,and no class will be allowed to exceed them in straight up fighting capacity.<BR> <BR>Spells CAN make up for our inferior melee capacity-IF Verant improves casting times and effectiveness to necromancer-equivalents(though not the spells at the same level the necro gains them,as before) and gives us better mitigation tricks(functional lifetaps,superior physical stuns and perhaps even a stun discipline) along with it.<BR> <BR>We go from being second-rate against 50+ mobs to masters of endurance-match melee. Hitting them with our swords regularly does nothing for increasing our combat lifespans at any level,as we will always do pathetic damage vs. a warrior or rogue with a weapon. <BR> <BR>Sucking the life out of mobs with our spells,slowing,drain-buffing and VE'ing it as we go(and if we get disease/poison spells,we will REALLY punish targets over time with spells)...we'd have a unique method of war here.<BR> <BR>And unique is what I want to be as an SK. No fancy graphics discs. No skeletal illusions. I don't want to donate mana-I want to torture the living. I want to take hits by getting the life out of my opponent to do so. I want my opponents to give me everything I desire to kill them.<BR> <BR>Fancy graphics and sword accuracy do nothing for making me able to survive when my game hits 50+. I see no trouble in living to that point,only being worth it to a party after that.<BR> <BR>As warriors,rogues,monks,and rangers even all are "offensive" meleers,I will gladly take "defensive" as it will mean I'm GOOD at it as opposed to trying to compete for the same slots in a party.<BR> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm going to continue crying 'Fix 2handers!!' until I'm blue in the face - hang on I already am blue in the face being of the darkelven kind, but you get my point...<P>The knight classes are the ONLY classes in the game that use 2handers! Everyone else either has duel-wield or uses their free hand for a magic focus item of some description. 2handers and 1hand/shield are the stock standard weapons for the knight classes so they should be equally desirable by shadowknights and paladins of all levels. <P>I applaud you doing a lot with the shield requests, but I ask that you make the 2hander equally as attractive. A shadowknight of any race ought to be able to regularly stun with a 2hander in much the same way we can bash with a shield. I mean shields are pretty heavy (you ever carried one? because I have) and the weight of a 2hander Vs 1hand/shield would be about the same. So a darkelf sk equipping a 2hander or a shield/1hand should have the same strength and chance to stun/bash and interrupt casters.<P>So what would be the reason to choose one over another? Well currently 1hand/shield is the flavour of the month because frankly 2handers are pathetic. But if 2handers were fixed you'd have the following choices...<P>1hand/shield<BR>Pro: increased AC, bash, lots of small taunting hits<BR>Con: You'd never have big hits, and getting off those spells would be problematic because you'd forfeit spell casting damage, also mob damage shields would be something to consider.<P>2handers<BR>Pro: greater melee damage, stuns, able to time spell-casts in between swings, less mob damage shield issues<BR>Cons: you'd lose AC, and you'd have to rely on your spells to act as taunts, also you swing slower.<P>But each combination SHOULD be as viable as each other! I mean the warriors have a plethora of weapon choices, currently we have two with one only being really viable.<P>I state again that the historical EQ sk swords have been 2handers - yet you have to be a large race in order to properly use them. Yet Innoruuk's (darkelven's God) Curse is a 2hand weapon with bash. Dark Reaver is a 2hander. Verant obviously sees shadowknights wielding 2handers, yet fails to understand that a great majority of the shadowknight class is small to medium race and they can't even properly use these weapons.<P>Please fix 2handers so they are a viable weapon choice, because at the moment shadowknights of small to medium size are being pushed in the direction of 1hand/shield and frankly I dislike being pressured into this weapon combo when it is NOT my choice to go that way!<P>Tryst, lady Reaver getting angry again<P>Oh, and please fix the swing/miss, swing/miss, swing/miss offensive fiasco!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My guild tried to take on Velkthor tonight.  The plan was, warriors would take turns running in, taunting, and using their "defensive" skill so clerics/healers would have time to cast a heal before the warrior died (Velkthor double hits for 850 WITHOUT Frenzy . . .).  <P>The role of the Clerics, Shaman, Druids, and even the Paladins would be to heal the warriors and keep them alive (pallys casting heal spell and using LoH especially).  Monks and Rogues would do there massive damage, using disciplnes when warriors ran out, especially "riposte" discipline.  Casters would run in, nuke, run out.  "Other" melee would stay back as far as they can and still be in range to attack, to avoid aggroing Velkthor.  Bards would play mana/speed songs for casters/melee.  (no rangers on raid).  <P>But what was the role of the Shadow knights?   . . . NOTHING!! NONE!!!  NADA!! ZIP, ZILCH!!  We HAD no role.  Although I'm only 52, the one other SK that went was 55 and he used his HT discipline and 'smote-away!'  Well, let me tell ya, he was RESISTED (like you thought anything else would happen).  So the ONE thing we are known for, the ONE thing that is SUPPOSED to be our SIGNATURE ability was TOTALLY USELESS!!!! <P>When the warriors' defensive discipline ran out, they lasted NO longer . . . well, maybe one more attack round longer, than I did.  Their higher armor class items, parry, riposte, dodge,  AND defensive skill STILL didn't make them last any longer.  Do you think if our defensive ability is raised to that of a warrior's we would be more effective?  NO.  We would die just as quick, quicker actually, than a warrior.  They only survived long enough for heals with their DISCIPLINE!!!!<P>People at Verant have said that SKs are a "defensive" class.  But our defining ability is an OFFENSIVE ability.  You want to make us defensive?  Give us LoH.  If not, Make it so  Harm Touch is Lure based.  Make it so we can LAND stuff, HT and magic as well.  And speaking of landing, the amount of time I actually HIT the mob was PATHETIC.  I do so little damage I might as well not even be there.  <P>Oh, if you DIDN'T notice in the very first sentence, I said we TRIED to take on Velkthor.  Twice.  WE could not do it.  In fact, we didn't get him past 60% both times.  The reason we couldn't do it?   We only had 4 warriors in the entire raid.  That's it.  Four.  And because of this, we all died twice and had to do a C-R.  <P>Now, if SKs had defenesive (bards, monks, paladins and rangers as well) We WOULD have been able to kill this guy!  I am conviced of that.  We could have stepped in and taken the "hits" when the warriors were out.  My dad used to say,  "You are only as strong as your weakest link."  "Well, we're a weak link."  We can hardly hit, can't cast spells (all of mine bounced), can't buff, heal, or even HT because it resists.  WE SKS are the weak link.  If you dispute me then tell me, what good are we?  We've gone from a fairly decent class pre level 51+, to falling ever so slightly . . . about as far and as fast as as lead ball sinks to the bottom of the ocean.  <P>Disciplines are not saved against.  They are either on or off.  Our spells, the reason for the old "exp penalty" are useless.  Our less than inferior tanking penalties are useless.  Please Verant, if you don't give us defensive discipline, give us a similar but equally as effective discipline if you want us to be Defensive.  Or make HT lure based.  Make us feel needed for our SKILLS, not just because we're friends with someone.  Don't make us the weak link.<P>   - Vorrek, 52 TSK, Quellious.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have been playing my SK for around 1.5 years and started the game the same week as Quellious started.<P>Defense Cap - this would certainly help with everyday tanking and I believe this is a good start.<P>Parry Cap - This should be looked at the same as our Defense cap.<P>Hit Points - Would be nice but you will have to make us different than warriors in some respect when it comes to defense as a whole.<P>Bash Skill - This certainly should be raised to equal a warrior.  Pallies and SKs use a shield for bashing more than any other class.<P>Better Shield Use - Sounds like a good idea.<P>Better Shield Stuns - This is a pretty good idea. <P>Shield Based Discipline - If it works in uber encounters then it is good.<P>Better Two-Handed Use - Well I do agree with your statement.  Out of the melee classes the Pally and SK are most likely to use a two-hander.  BUT this hurts us way too much to do it.  The GREAT loss of AC and losing the ability to stun(small races) just doesn't make it worth it.  Early in a SKs career(pre kunark) 2-handers were fine but that has all changed.  The benefit of shields are WAY too great to pass up. <P>Taunt - Hmm  I won't argue with you if you want to increase it.<P>Archery - Won't hurt to increase this.<P>Pets - Lower level pets are pretty useless<P>Spell Review - Certainly this would be helpful.  The lifetap line of spells I very rarely use aside from Life Leeche.  Many spells just use too much mana/time to make them worth while.<P>Casting Times - The casting time on spells are awful post 50.  There are way too many spells that I will never use.  The life taps, cascading darkness, etc..<P>Life Leeche - only problem I have is the 3k but I did it so I am sure others can too.<P>Summon Corpse - This is by far one of the better things we have been given.  I love this and think we should have it.  If a pally can revive someone there is no reason we don't have a staple spell from our parent class.<P>Vamperic Curse and Soul Consumption - Well seeing how it used to work and now doesn't leads me to believe it is a bug.  I think this happened the same time the heal over time spells were fixed to stack with regens.<P>Lifetaps - The use of our life taps is awful.  Life Leeche is the only one I keep memed.  The rest either don't heal enough or take too long to cast and are a little too late level wise. ie we get them at a level that makes them not as useful.  (casting time is still a problem)<P>Voice Graft - Don't think this really matters.<P>Vampiric Embrace - I don't use it.  A upgrade may change my mind.  The thing I dislike about it is that when it does proc you actually cast the spell taking away time for swings.  I think just a way to make it proc like a yak would be nice so it doesn't interupt our swings.<P>Grim Aura - Won't hurt anything but certianly isn't a big issue.<P>Low level evocation spells - Would be nice but again not a big deal.<P>Disease/Poison Spells - A upgrade to disease cloud would be great but again not a big deal.<P>Blood Ember Armour - They are heavy.  What are the weights compared to other classes armour? I think they should be compareable.  If anything comes up with BE armour it should be the drop rate.  These items are very rare compared to the other classes.<P>Unholy Aura - Nice idea to improve our 55th level discipline.<P>Leechcurse - Reduction of reuse time and in all honestly we need a defensive discipline.  It  doesn't make much sense to have a rogue tank for us.<P>Ashenbone Shield and Shield of the Stalwart Seas - I certainly agree that this should be changed to more closely fit the vision of a SK and pally.  Not really a balance item but worth looking at.<P>Innoruuk's Curse - Inny rules.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  OK I can understand this but again not a balance issue.<P>Skeleton Form - Just for looks nothing more.  Not related to balance.<P>Sheild Procs - Nice idea.<P><BR>That is my 2 cents.<P>Kae</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Thanks Absor but like a lot of people I feel like some important issues were missed and too much attention given to some trivial ideas.<P>&gt;&gt;ITEM: Defense Skill Cap.<BR>&gt;&gt;ITEM: Parry Cap.<BR>&gt;&gt;ITEM: Hit Points.<P>Yes to defense and parry skills being increased, but where is dodge?<P>While it pains me to say this more HP would take away from warriors too much IMO however. Give us the same defense as warriors, let them keep the offense and hp advantage.<P>&gt;&gt;ITEM: Bash Skill Cap.<BR>&gt;&gt;ITEM: Better Shield Use.<BR>&gt;&gt;ITEM: Better Shield Stuns.<BR>&gt;&gt;ITEM: Shield-based discipline.<P>A better bash skill would be nice but there is no need to make the game more complicated. The reason SKs go two hand is that they do so much more damage with the 2H weapons available. Instead of doing cheesy things like making 2H weapons bash enabled, what you really need to do for SKs (and Paladins) is have a lot more good 1H weapons available, with damage output close to 2H options. And PLEASE take SKs and Pals off of 1H weapons that were obviously made for dual wield classes, example exquisite velium 12/20. <P>&gt;&gt;ITEM: Better Two-Handed Use.<BR>&gt;&gt;DESCRIPTION: Realistically, it is the &gt;&gt;shadowknight and the paladin that are most &gt;&gt;likely to use a two-handed weapon. So perhaps &gt;&gt;we should make them better at using them than &gt;&gt;they are now, give them more incentive to use &gt;&gt;them.<P>Dude. Read the boards. Most SKs and Pals believe they are the shield classes and want 1H weapons. They go 2H because they have no choice.<P>&gt;&gt;ITEM: Taunt.<P>SK taunt is fine. Warrior taunt is fine. Everyone's taunt is fine.<P>&gt;&gt;ITEM: Archery.<P>I do not believe SKs are an archery class. If you want to make this better I might use it but it's sure not an important hybrid balance issue.<P>However, raising the disarm cap would be useful and in line with our role. I am a lvl 58 SK, disarm often to help taunt, maxed it long ago and have NEVER successfully disarmed any mob.<P>&gt;&gt;ITEM: Pets.<P>Low level pets need help (pre 49), the higher ones are fine.<P>&gt;&gt;ITEM: Spell Review.<BR>&gt;&gt;ITEM: Casting Times.<P>An important issue to me is that most high level SKs simply do not use mana in group/raid situations. This should tell you how useful the spells are. IMO the biggest issue is lifetaps, they take far too long to cast at all levels than for what you get from them.<P>&gt;&gt;ITEM: Lifeleech.<P>Not a big issue but having this spell and the Epic Quest weapon take so many plats seems kind of unfair when it happens to just SKs.<P>&gt;&gt;ITEM: Summon Corpse.<P>Hmm, show me an SK who doesn't think this is in line with our role? And it does not take away from necros in any way, in fact it helps them (and all other players) with a utility spell that can become a chore. <P>&gt;&gt;ITEM: Vampiric Curse and Soul Consumption.<P>Please for the love of evil FIX THIS. Celestial heals are HEALS not regens, they should friggin stack with these two effects.<P>&gt;&gt;ITEM: Lifetaps.<P>Life leech is the only life tap type spell that SKs use. Obviously there is something wrong with the ones you have given us. We need better ones or what can I say, we still won't use them.<P>&gt;&gt;ITEM: Gather Shadows.<P>Actually what needs to happen here is that you need to take away ALL invis items from pure melees. I puke everytime I see a monk invis from an incarnadine BP from inventory, please this is what we gave up our offense and defense for.<P>&gt;&gt;ITEM: Voice Graft.<P>Ridiculous request, let's focus on balance issues please.<P>&gt;&gt;ITEM: Vampiric Embrace.<P>Yes an upgrade would be good, note same needs to be done with Shroud of Death.<P>&gt;&gt;ITEM: Grim Aura.<P>Sure, but again trivial.<P>&gt;&gt;ITEM: Low level evocation spells.<P>Not needed. We have our undead line of spells to work with.<P>&gt;&gt;ITEM: Disease/poison spells.<P>I use boil blood. I would like more dots and think that's an important aspect of what SKs should be.<P>&gt;&gt;ITEM: BloodEmber Armor.<P>I am Erudite SK and the weight is not a problem for me, but if you want to make it lighter I won't complain.<P>&gt;&gt;ITEM: Unholy Aura.<P>I like the idea of adding a lifetap aspect to this. But of course what we really want is for this to work on all mobs.<P>&gt;&gt;ITEM: Leechcurse.<P>It needs some help yes.<P>&gt;&gt;ITEM: Ashenbone Shield and Shield of the Stalwart.<P>Fixing graphics would be good, not a balance issue. :P<P>&gt;&gt;ITEM: Innoruuk's Curse.<P>This is getting stupid, please ignore this request, the sword has the name for a reason and it is irrelevant what deity an SK worships with respect to it.<P>&gt;&gt;ITEM: Skeleton Form.<P>I do not want skeleton form.<P>&gt;&gt;ITEM: Shield Procs.<P>Ok, but I still just want better 1H weapons.<P>And finally since we're talking, PLEASE reconsider the Venril Sathir faction debacle in Kunark. All we need is a way to up the faction from KOS, just give positive faction on some mobs somewhere.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

NO need to give it to us.  <P>One other item that has nothing to do with class balance but I will mention it since there is the item about the ashenbone vs stalwart graphics.

</FONT><HR>Make it hurt to hit me.  Since mobs can usually hit me for max double/quad damage, make it hurt, don't let them do it for free.  Banshee aura should be in the SK list already at level 22 and I think significantly improved at each of the spell levels, 30, 39, and 49.<P>I agree with the poster who mentioned this was the biggest "do nothing" list for adding class balance.<P>Tryst, I am with you.  Imagine the joy I had obtaining the "Deathbringers Rod".  I have to laugh at all the air I have killed since I got this bad looking 2h blunt.  I find it pathetic that players of this level are hitting with less frequency than when they were trying to hit their first rat at level 1.  A shadowknight with a 30/40 weapon should be making some mush out of a mob.  Instead we use it to hypnotize mobs so the rogues can use metal toothpicks to poke holes for mega damage (the best weapon of which I think is 13/30 for backstabs, 10/21 for regular melee, may be wrong but still, insignicant ratio compared to 30/40).  Something is a little backwards here.<P>I too have to believe there is nobody at VI wasting their time trying to play a SK.  Archery?  I use an arrow only when I don't have a SoW for pulling as I need the longer head start outdoors.  Otherwise I would never use it.<P>Do you realize that harmtouch has its most significant impact when your are level one?  On an even con you can do almost 50% of the mobs health in damage with HT.  That percentage continues to shrink with each level.  The same is true when you evaluate your spells for battle effectiveness (damage per mana second).  The worst battle mode spells we receive are actually our spells at 50+.  Because the casting times are so long, the mana so high, and the damage so insignificant, most all high level SK do not even mem them.  People who play SK would know this yet VI seems to ignore this lost use of what should be our most significant spells.<P>The most heavily used spells in my levels post 40 were darkness, fear, disease cloud, and vortex.  Darkness is always dropped in favor of more effective and laster longing snares when available.  Once in a dungeon, fear is forgotten as well.  THE SPELLS OF THE SK DO NOT FIT THE VISION OR THE NEW IMAGE ABASHI HAS PUT FORTH FOR SK!  To be honest they simply have very little utility in the game that has been created since Kunark.  The best use of my mana in this game is to darken, fear, and try to melee when I am in a group with no healers outdoors.  Indoors my mana bar is almost always full as my spells contribute almost nothing to a dungeon experience.  To use my mana on anything else means I miss melee attempts.  In dungeons it is too ineffective to try and cast and be interrupted or resisted to opt for a spell over melee.  To burn mana on heat blood or heart flutter at this level is simply inefficient and a waste. SoV has only made this issue more so.<P>Also, what is the fettish with all the enhancements being needed after you obtain level 51?  Don't you realize that all the post 51 stuff created is virtually unused?  The spells have casting times so high they cannot be effectively used in battle.  The melee/tanking skills are so low that neither is significant.  The disciplines aren't getting SK raids.  The entire spell list of the SK, not just 51+ but from level 9, has nothing to do with enhancing a group or for affecting a battle IN progress.  There is nothing that exists or is proposed that makes the SK attractive in the higher level game.  If you want improvements, drop the casting times so all are less than 2 seconds.  You can avoid chain casting my simply increasing the recast time.  At least let there be honest attempts to cast what should be our best spells in battle.  This can start with spells already showing up at level 22 I believe.  I also believe that the number of high MR mobs in the upper game is excessive.  I can understand a few mobs having high MR but too much of the game has boiled down to melee only.  What hurts the pure casters goes doubly for us.  I also think that in light of the pathetic melee we have, the spells we cast need to be taken up a couple of notches.<P>Bash is a pathetic, overly rated skill.  Why can I say that?  BECAUSE NO WARRIORS USE THE SHIELDS ONCE DUAL WIELD IS OBTAINED.  Warriors use kick for stun now and disciplines more than make up for the little AC the shield gives them.  Do people realize that goblin warriors in Butcherblock have a higher stun/interrupt rate with their bash than a high level SK.  Bash needs a higher interrupt rate and also more damage assigned to it.<P>It seems you are trying Absor but if this list is the result of the threads, either we did not communicate them well, you misunderstood many of the posts, or Abashi is filtering this whole discussion.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000670-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000670.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000670-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000670-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000670-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000670-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000670&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000670&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
