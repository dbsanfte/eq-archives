</FONT><HR>I think what you (and I, and most of us) are looking for is possible.  But it won't be EQ.  It's too late for that - the core of the game is too well established and too expensive to change.  <P>The lower levels of EQ are great.  So my solution is simple - when a character gets to a high enough level to stop being fun for casual play, I start over with a new class.  My third character just hit 30, and I'm having a great time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think you are right on the money. People not being able to do things "fun" unless they have uber chars with uber balance with SEAL like precision will be the downfall of this game. I took a 2 month break seriously contemplating quitting this game. It just wasn't/isn't fun anymore. I didn't buy Velious cause I thought it would be a waste of money. Friend told me it was just $20 so I went out and bought it. How many times have I been there? Twice. I've had it since 5 days after release. Biggest waste of $20. After you play a game so long you start to think WHY you play so much. Think hard and the game is pretty pointless. <BR>1. Mad dash to level 60 <BR>2. Get uber-loot<BR>3. Get on huge raids...oh wait, can't do that anymore, everyone is 50+ now, planes and all have gone FFA and uber-guilds rule<BR>...point is, this game is getting pointless.<BR>VI might answer by saying that EQ offers a community in which you can meet new people and past the time together in a dungeon cracking jokes while swiping at mobs and laughing. Occasional CR..nothing bad, you laugh at the mistake of dying and start over. Now it is different...you can't past the time swiping at mobs and laughing. It is all sweat and concentration now...that is IF you can find the PERFECT group. No time to chat, only time to hope that your cleric can get the heal off in time or that your wiz/dru can get that evac off. This is depressing, I'm gonna stop now. GREAT post though, truly great.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>BUMP AND AGREED!!!!<P>Any random mix-match of any 6 people should be able to perform ALMOST as well as a well balanced 6 man team.

</FONT><HR>I think there's a solution. <BR> <BR>Monsters are made "magicproof"<BR> <BR>Untouchable,obscene HP to prevent nukage,high resists in every type,and doubly so in MR specifically. Hit like freight trains.<BR> <BR>Where are the "meleeproof" monsters?<BR> <BR>Can't effectively be struck,obscene AC to prevent such and defensive skills doubly so. Cast like wizards or necros. Reduce average tank to flaming debris without meleer getting in a soild hit edgewise. <BR> <BR>These mobs should be magic-vulnerable the way the average high-level mob is melee-vulnerable,if not more so. And they should be mixed in with "magicproof" mobs. Heck,"magicproof" mobs should be summoning these things in battle if they're uber enough.<BR> <BR>Vox should be calling up a few frost critters when she isn't using the breath or such things,and watch those tanks get frozen solid unless the wizard taunts them off(and can then fry em before the monsters freeze THEM up instead). A few Lure of Frost-chucking creatures should inspire a little more diversity in who goes on a raid.<BR> <BR>Double or triple this for Velious ubers. Heck,there are some mobs in Velious that are 100% resistant to magic. Where's the melee equivalents? Why aren't such creatures drifting around with the magicproof horrors in many Velious zones?<BR> <BR>The concept can easily be extended down the line to merely "tough as hell to hit,but easily tagged by spells and fragile" at lower levels. It'd get people used to it.<BR> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I totaly agree.  The classes dont have to balanced, but the game should be.  If character A can solo a low blue at lvl 1 then character should always be able to solo a low blue.  If a blue dangerous is, just that, dangerous for character for Character A, but Char A usually wins it should stay that way to lvl 60 and beyond if that ever happens.  A green should always be a green, a blue a blue, a white/black a white/black, a yellow a yellow, and a red a red.  And no more underconning.  That is just a pathetic I want to kill you character the first you meet the mob that is underconned at blue and should be yellow or red attempt by VI.  An example is Dorn in NRO or Gix WC.  Dorn was blue at 16 and Gix at 18, they both whopped my rear when I tried to solo for some payback at those lvl.  They did not whoop me like a blue dangerous should, but more like a yellow or even a low red.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yes, I'm afraid a lot of the things we're talking about here can't be fully realized in EQ. I sure do hope they make it more like what we're talking about in EQ2 however.<P>But I think they can still make it fun again for us casual types in EQ1. But first they will have to recognize the PROBLEM in which we're pointing out. I got a feeling they don't think it's a problem. I have a feeling that they think it may be us with the problem.<P>Possible Verant retorts.<BR>Verant:"If the level 50-60 enviroment is too much for you what does it matter? If you're having fun pre-50 just stay there then."<P>--What? Delevel myself constantly? Start a new character over every time I reach 50? I know that's what some people do. <P>This is the typical EQ Players game life. Start a Class you want. Level it to 50, can't get groups. ReStart a Group Desired class (cleric,enchanter) that has a low population. <BR>Why must we be forced to play 2 classes? I just want to play one. The one I want.<BR>What if I'm lucky and I picked the Cleric the first time out? What if the Cleric population quadruples? Can I still get groups as fast as a I used to? <P>Verant: "Can't get into regular groups? Join an organized guild."<P>---I'm in a fairly large organized guild and I still can't get groups with them (except for the occasional raid every two weeks). Want to know why? <BR>a.&gt; Time zone differences<BR>b.&gt; Play time differences<BR>c.&gt; Level differences<BR>d.&gt; Class compatibility differences<BR>e.&gt; Faction differences, some of my evil bethren cannot hunt in Karnors, some of the Giant friends I can't hunt with in Skyshrine.<P>Your game has too many requirements and conditions. And only uber power gamers that can abandon any RL responsibilities at the drop of dime for at least 8 hour time slots like firemen responding to a 911 call get to enjoy your game.<P>To play your game you have to be in a GUILD that all plays at the same times, has players that play each of the classes in a balanced faculty staff ( guild members:24, 4 Warriors, 4 Clerics, 1 Paladin, 1 SK, 1 Ranger, 2 Monks,1 Wizard, 1 Shaman, 1 Druid, 4 Enchanters, 1 Necro, 1 Mage, 2 Rogues,), the staff ends in a number divisible by 6, you are all "on-call" status should something spawn, and you are all selfless and love to spend countless hours taking turns helping each other camp insane hours for equipment.<P>(sarcasm) yah, like I'll ever be in this guild.<P>These guilds do exits though, they're called The Mystical Order, Fires of Heaven, etc,etc....<P>I think the game should be designed around the common casual player in mind. That means the uber guilds get to get everything real fast and kill anything anytime though right&gt;? So what? They're uber. They sacrifice a lot of RL stuff to be that way. They deserve it. Let them win. I don't care. Then they'll get bored and move on. Or they tackle those 1 or 2 zones you designed for them over and over. BUT....BUT, leave 95% of the rest of the world tuned to normal players please.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree completely with this thread. I can stomach raids maybe once every 2 weeks, barely that. Its just dull. I prefer a small group. And yes, SoV was a waste of money really. Its just a big guild mall.<P>I don't think they will do anything about it however. They are too stuck in a rut. I think the best we can hope for is a game from another company, because the same people behind this mess will be the ones behind any "EQ2". Their philosphy doesn't appear to be changeable, therefore the game design style is unlikely to as well.<P>And As one persone said 30, to 50 is the best portion of the game for a lot of people. And yes, you can always start a new class. Well, I've run out of classes that are remotely interesting.<P>Necro, cleric, rogue, enc, shaman, warrior... 2 over 50 who have nothing to do (cleric and necro) and the rest either halfway to 50 or higher. So i guess I've just about used up the game thats playable to me.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>AMEN!!!!<P>I think this is the first time that I have read a post where everyone agrees! VI if you ignore this one you have some serious customer relation issues. This has been the problem since day one of your nerf/enhan quest. This game has gone from fun to stressful, tedious, redundant. I agree 100% for longing back in the days of old when it was an adventure for you and the people you grouped with or picked up along the way. If you had a full group you could charge and conquer with an awesome feeling of accomplishment. This has been long over due to get back to basics and stop trying to throw us a bone thinking that’s going to solve the problem. You have turned us against each other with your “Class Balancing”.<P>This thread must not die and NEEDS VI attention!!<P><BR>P.S.

</FONT><HR>I have to agree with this thread.<P>One solution (and its too late probably) is to cap damage at a certain level. Like, say at level 35 a rogue shouldnt be able to do over X damage per attack or tick, or not over Y when backstabbing as fast as possible. So, using internal formulas, if the character's damage meets or exceeds the value, it caps. You could even cap hit points and other attributes by level, and you could have a buffed and an unbuffed cap. That way, if you could twink your rogue or whatever enough, a lot of items would be wasted.<P>But its too late to do this on EQ.<P>On a mud I used to code on and run, damage might be capped to your level. A level 50 warrior could not do more than 50 points of damage in a hit, and that value was factored in with his highest attack rate in mind, assuming he hit every time. THEN, a certain percentage of that max damage was guaranteed, because of the warrior's skill with weapons. He would have (for example) an innate +25 damage. So, even with an off-the rack sword with no magic on it, and with minimal or no magic items, he might do 30 points of damage. So, a warrior with off the shelf equipment was a force to be feared, and the variety in weapons in the game allowed a warrior to easily make up the difference in the damage he could do between the 30 base and 50 max in any way possible. So most warriors would float at 40-50 damage. Even buffs from other classes couldnt let him exceed 50, and the game was balanced vs the number 50 as far as monsters are concerned. That way, it encouraged variety in weapon choice. Clerics were capped at 35 on melee damage for the intervals they were hitting at, and they got 20 of it for free, at level 50, say. And when spell effects of clerics were considered, they had magic effect caps also, and these were hand tailored to work with their melee caps. Etc etc.<P>It wasnt easy, but you *could* have many combinations of groups, even an mostly-melee group could do well.<P>But that has to be done at the design level up front.<P>The only solution I see for EQ has to be done by players. a) voice your complaints in a rational manner and b) dont play over level 50.<P>Yes, many of up paid money for the expansions. Maybe that is our loss, though Kunark can be enjoyed from 1-50. But, I have found much pleasure in playing at the lower levels, and all the fun of getting groups of practically ANY combination of classes works in the lower levels, especially pre-35. Anytime I find myself frustrated by lack of balance or mudflation, I retreat to a low level character with a group of friends and work up again and have fun with it.<P>So twink all you like, or dont, but enjoy the lower levels. If you cant resist twinking yourself, have everyone start their seconds (or thirds or 4ths or 16th) on another server where nobody knows anyone else.<P>Or try team pvp for a change from level 1 if you are up for a real thrill.<P>Either way, you CAN get that fun and friendship going someway or another. That doesnt mean you shouldnt insist that Verant fix the problem, but it does mean you can have fun and avoid being mad.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Works for me.<P>AnimatedU<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The problem isn't really one Verant created intentionally, its the side effect of the player-driven economy and the age of the game.  As players get higher in level, they accumulate more wealth.  They never go backwards in level (except the occasional death.. and let's face it, no matter how many times in a row you die unreasonably, your overall experience gain is positive over time).  So what happens?  The average player's level increases... some get bored and start others... but then over time, they get higher as well.  I'd be willing to bet the average player's highest level character is well over 40 now, including the casual gamers.  I'm considered casual by "uber" guilds, and I have 3 characters over 40, and 2 more in their late 30s.  Verant is forced to add more content for higher level players and don't add any mid game content, simply because there are so many more high level players.  As time goes on, it only gets worse.<P>The same applies to equipment.  Equipment is all worth money, and money is slowly accumulated over time.  The amount of money in the game is ever increasing.  The amount we give to merchants for food, spell components, etc, is very minor compared to how much is gained each day.  Why is a Yak going for 500 pp on my server now?  Probably because I'm on the Rathe (which is in DESPERATE need of a split btw, we are close to 3k users every night and ALWAYS #1 on the total user column).  The main cause of this is that the amount of PP always increases and never goes down, so its relative value decreases.  This can NEVER be fixed, except to destroy plats and items owned by players.  Why is Velious so hard?  It HAS to be, because if it wasn't, people would kill everything there with the super high-level characters and equipment they have.  Within the next year, most every player will own items that are terribly valuable by current standards, and so the MOBs must be beefed up to meet that challenge.  It's a natural progression of the game, and its not fair to Verant to say "YOU DON'T FIX THE REAL PROBLEM"... they CAN'T, its like growing old... it just happens... the best you can do is enjoy the game until it everyone is so high that its unplayable.  Once that happens, we will be ready to move on to the next game.<P>My personal preference would be a brand new server, with only the 3 original continents, that we could start over in.  Maybe move all the loot around so people wouldn't know exactly where to camp, and make it fun to play again... back when bronze armor was something to be in awe of.<P>The only real flaw in the game was the types of items that were available at your current level.  The strength of the MOBs in the game are such that a Yak is only a mid-level weapon, yet it drops in a 40+ location.  At the level the Yak is appropriate for, I think Fine Steel is the best you can hope for to drop.  Had the magic items available followed a natural progression up to 60, I think there would have been less twinking overall... and if not, then there should have been minimum level requirements for weapons... keep in mind though, that minimum level only works IF there are sufficient weapons of good enough quality at the level you obtain them.<P>In conclusion, don't blame Verant for the state of the game.  It was originally a strong, healthy, powerful game, and now past middle age and is starting to suffer from arthritis and minor cancers.  It will eventually die, all games do.  They can't fix it any more than a doctor can stop death.  Its a natural consequence of the game design.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wanted to add a big comment here.<P>Are you familiar with the parable of the three blind men and the elephant? It's an excellent life lesson. Essentially three blind men are presented with an elephant and asked to describe it. They all were examining the same elephant. One man found the elephant's trunk, and said "elephants are like snakes!". The next man found the elephant's leg and said "no no no, elephants are like trees!".  The third one found the tusk and said "no no elephants are like spears!"<P>My point is that I don't want us to latch on to specifics and miss the bigger picture. Perhaps the easiest way to label the problem without the "mobflation" label are these two simple facts with very far reaching consequences:<P>1) Ever since Kunark, Verant has made it a point to further "diversify" the classes (ie, make the specialists better at their specialties)<P>and<P>2) Then they design encounters based on whether or not the specialists can pull it off, and whether or not everybody else can simply find something to do.<P>The easiest way to describe this is "mobflation", but specifically it's a double-standard in the mob/dungeon design process, over which we as players have really very little input on.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Kynara, I think you're missing the point of this thread entirely. Please don't take that as an insult.<P>It's not the age of our characters and it's not the falling rarity of items or money. It's the gameplay we're talking about.<P>This concept is hard to explain if you don't understand it in the first place.<P>You're trying to say that the disatification we have with the gameplay stems from the fact that we've played to game so long that we're wearing out the life of the game. Like as if it had a regular cycle of attention it gets from us like other games.<P>That's not the problem. Whether I've only played this game two months or two years, the game still has these issues.<P>Now in the beginning, most of us thought that as newbies we lived in a small world. Adventuring beyond newbie zones meant death. As you leveled, new zones and places were open to you. So naturally a player would begin to deduce that as you level, more options of things to do will open up to you. That's one of the many reasons why people level. Or at least initially.<P>But the catch is, it's not true. As we leveled we arrived to the uper-ranks of our enviroment (the 50+ enviroment) only to find we have less options available to us (and when I say "us" , I mean the normal gamer, not the power gamer).<P>Based on statements I've read here on the boards from Verant, the 50+ enviroment was designed for the more hardcore player. If the normal gamer cannot thrive in this enviroment, then simply it is not meant for him.<P>This condition, (intentional or not) actually hurts their player base. That essentially means that once a normal/casual gamer reaches 50, he is done with the game. He has reached the curtain between "coach" and "first class" on an airplane. <P>This is why so many people come to the boards to complain to Verant about the 50+ game. They don't want to stop at 50whatever. They have a sentimental attatchment to their much invested characters. Why would they want to stop just at 50? What if they want to see more?  Start a new character? Why? I like my first character, that's why I play him. Start again with same class? Why repeat myself? Start another class? What if I don't want to play another class?<P>However, realistically speaking, Verant is safe from these regular gamers that reach 50+. They are safe because of several reasons. <BR>1.&gt; Some of these players will simply start a new character they "feel" will make them more desired and thus take them to the 50+ enviroment. ( Cleric or Enchanter).<BR>2.&gt; Some will putz around like zombies thinking that in a few months Verant will hear our pleas and re-tune zones,gameplay, or whatever. " I'll hang around a little longer and see."<P>So these disatisfied players won't quit. So Verant is safe from them. That's a shame though. Because if all of them did quit, Verant would really act quicker on addressing the gameplay issures.<P>For most of us (and this is a repeat of what's been already said basically), the source of our disatifaction isn't that we can't get our epics, or our uber plane drop, or we can't see Veeshan's Peak, etc, etc.<P>For us, it simply the fact we can't play. Period.<BR>A lot of us just want to simply log on, get into a group in a realistic amount of time, see sights, kill monsters, maybe side track ourselves in some nice quests.<P>But right now we can't do any of those 50+.<BR>--Grouping: if you're not a Cleric/Enchanter you sit at a zoneline shouting for a group for Hours and Hours.<BR>--Quests: they are all designed to limit the rate in which the reward enters the world. Thus, they require idiotic camping. A lot of these camps don't always yield results. It is quite possible that if I camped Raster, that I could be there for 3 months. It IS possible.<P>Re-Read what I wrote previously in this thread and some of the others posts too.<P>Our disatisfaction DOES NOT come from the age of Everquest game. I myself didn't play EQ until it had been out for a year.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>BigJP24, I agree that there is a fair number of places where 50+ players can go to hunt. But only a few of those places are zones where people can get into a pick-up group.<P>There's three types of zones.<BR>1.&gt; Pick-Up Group friendly zone.<BR>2.&gt; BYOG (Bring Your Own Group) zone.<BR>3.&gt; Raid Zone (Bring Multiple Groups with you)<P>Skyfire- low population.  BYOG zone<BR>Burning Woods- low population.

</FONT><HR>I agree wholeheartadly. <P>The only thing I would add is that this does not mean make every place require even 6 people. A 2, 3, or 4 person group should be able to have fun as well. Even a solo player deserves some fun. Everyone is paying ten bucks to have fun. It aint right to exclude all but the uberguilds. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I feel the solution is making mobs that do not require only one brand of "specialists". That brand,BTW,is melee.<BR> <BR>Could you imagine the average L60 warrior getting out-"tanked" by the wizards? Or relying on the wizards to keep his butt clear of the incoming stream of melee-impervious mobs? Or watching the killer TreeBeast_001 in PoG laugh off his sword but wither under the shamans disease DD's?<BR> <BR>I think the primary flaw in monster design is that all of them are hackable. A warrior can kill EVERYTHING. He's the swiss army knife of damage delivery.<BR> <BR>Yet there are magicproofed monsters all over the place. Where are the monsters that warriors run away from,yet casters meet with lesser dread?<P> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Agreed.  Class balance is only a step in making this game fun again.  Whatever happened to wandering around Everfrost with 3 or four friends and having a great time?  Or how about camping out in Erud's crossing.  I know the most fun I have had recently was with a small group of friends just outside Karnor's.  This of course was right after we had all just been slaughtered because we just couldn't get enough people together for the old Dungeon Crawl.  How can anyone be social in a social game when a real friend is to busy trying to help organize a group of 30 or more to even have time to say HI!....?  I fondly remember the days when 5 or 6 of us could go anywhere we wanted.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What you think of as twinking is just basic game evolution.  In a game with no item decay where items are constantly coming into the game what was once considered uber eventually filters down to lower level players.  Take the ykesha for example, once a legendary weapon now something any lvl 20 with 1kpp can easily obtain.  Level limits or skill limits on items would only lead to most items ending up in the bank, sure you wouldnt see a lvl 15 with dual lammies and full cobalt armor anymore, but you would just trading one problem for another.  I think the main problem with eq right now is you cant just log in and do something productive with a few friends, you need 20-30 people with the right combination of classes to do absolutely anything.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Innoruuksk i just had to comment on this because you are just so way off.  Casters are already way overpowered compared to melee classes, sure on big mobs your spells might get resisted alot but you can still land them or do other things to help. Mob resisting your wizard spells? try lures, or try another kind of spell.  Mob resisting your druid nukes? heal, buff, try snaring.  Mob resisting your mage nukes? dmg shield the tanks, send the pet in, debuff. Mob resisting your necro lifetaps? let the cleric borrow your mana, send the pet in... etc etc etc.  As to making a mob that makes warriors run but casters can fight? you are kidding right? 99% of the mobs in eq already do that.  Casters got plenty of things to do if a mob resists their spells, melee classes only got one thing, their weapons (and im only talking about pure melee here).  If anything needs to be done is give melee more power compared to casters.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
