</FONT><HR>After playing clerics for a while, i've decided to start a warrior. Could anyone help me create a warrior close to this ideal? :<P>I'd like to him to master his weapon skills FAST. I'd like to be proficient in as many weapon skills as possible. I don't care about strength or stamina- those can be brought up by items. But I DO want my little guy to be smart. (Hehe, i guess i have been spoiled since both of my clerics are Erudites. <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif">) Can anyone help me with this?<P>I've also got a few questions about warriors:<P>1. I've heard they can use this really cool type of armor called "crafted." What is this type like? Also, is it better than fine plate?<P>2. It seems that warriors always seem to be VERY well off, compared to my clerics. Is this true? Is it easier to get money as a warrior, either through loot or other means?<P>3. Are warriors easier to level than clerics?<P>4. Do warriors naturally get more hitpoints, or is it just a factor of their stamina? If it's the latter, i plan on getting some stamina gear for my clerics soon <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">...<P>5. Do pallies naturally get more HP's than casters? If so, is it as much as warriors get?<P>Thank you again for any help <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Balkor where are you?  Balkor is our resident warrior expert on this board, but I've played a warrior til lvl 25 and know a little something about it and I can tell you that discounting the strength stat in creating a warrior is a big mistake. Armor weapons are heavy, VERY heavy and even an ogre warrior with his str stat maxed has precious little room for carrying anything once he's suited up in full bronze. <P>Ignoring stamina is a big mistake as well because it affects your AC and armor class is God to a warrior. I know what your're planning, you're thinking if you max out your warrior's wisdom and intellegence stats he'll learn new skills more rapidly and be able to master more weapons. There is some truth to this, but all the int and wis in the world won't help a warrior if he doesn't live long enough to use them. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1) Crafted is warrior-only armor created by some centaurs in South Karana.  You can find details on the quests at everquest.allakhazam.com.  It is much better than fine plate.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>2) ROFL!!!  No way!  No spells to buy, but you live and die based purely on the quality of your gear.  Unless your clerics are very high-level and can subsidize him, he will always be poor.  No, what you're observing is the fact that warriors are the alt of choice for most casters since it's apparently such a nice change of pace for them to just stand up and swing; and it's common practice to give a lower-level alt some, err, "advantages" to make the beginning a little less painful.<P>3) Well, that depends on your playing style, the quality of their gear, and luck.  All else being equal, clerics are easier to level since warriors have zero escape or damage-avoidance abilities (clerics have ITU, stun, root, atone, and gate).  Also, at higher levels clerics are never in a group without someone who can give them an xp rez (themselves hehe).  However, with some judicious twinkage (good armor, a couple Langseax, an Axe of the Ironback or similarly low-damage low-delay 2h weapon because there's a damage cap below 20) warriors can fairly zing through levels 6 to 20 or so (I recommend against twinking before level 6 in case something happens and you can't get the corpse right away).<P>4) Warriors get a steadily-increasing level-based bonus to their HP.  It isn't terribly significant at first, but regardless of stamina, warriors can expect to hit 1khp somewhere around level 30.<P>5) I believe that paladins get a bonus too, but warriors get the highest HP bonus, period.<P>6) People here speak highly of 7th Hammer and Luclin for general server friendliness.<P>7) I've heard great things about Balkor.  Unfortunately, he left the board before I started posting here.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">  Since then, we've had to make do with some mid- to high-level warriors such as Ashara, Balkin, Ordith, Raaj, Brania, Tarelil, myself, and a host of others (what can I say, it's a popular class  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> ).<P>8) Str is good because it adds a little to ATK, but it isn't the end-all and be-all.  Bronze is heavy, but higher-level armors such as crafted are much lighter.  Plus, str items are fairly common and cheap.  I've done just fine with a base str of 115.  However, it's one of the stats you'll want to look at for your "smart" warrior since it determines offensive skill raises (except weapon skills).<P>9) Sta has no effect on AC.  However, it would be good to make it at least 100, since that way the only effect of running out of the yellow bar will be that you can't jump -- low-sta warriors with heavy, fast weapons end up needing "zing" (Invigor) to refresh their yellow bar and get rid of the associated stat penalties and decreased swing speed.<P>10) Agi is the stat that improves AC.  Since it has a very small effect, you really only need 75 (where there's a bonus).  However, for your "smart" warrior, it's agi that determines defensive skill raises.<P>11) The real stat for a "smart" warrior is dex, which determines weapon skill raises.  It also influences proc rates, and the rate of crits/crips.  It's a fairly unconventional choice for a prime stat since most people only keep up a couple weapon skills and learn the others when they have to, and crits are random and unreliable, but a coworker of mine has a 50+ warrior with around 200 dex, and it's worked out fine for him.<P>For more info on warriors, see this thread:<P>http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum10/HTML/005366.html<P>For more info on stats, see this thread:<P>http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum10/HTML/004582.html<P>Tudan &lt;Flux of Chaos&gt;<BR>a_barbarian_warrior35<BR>Torvonnilous</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Increase in weapon skill depends on DEX, so you better chose a race with a good starting dexterity. I highly recommend dwarven warriors, they have the highest starting DEX of all races, 90. You get 25 bonus points of which you should put 20 in STR and 5 in AGI. Your starting AGI of 75 is just below the a border value where AGI affects AC more than before.<P>It is technically impossible to maximize a warriors weapons skills below level 10. If you hit greens, your skill doesn't rise. If you hit blues or whites, your level goes up faster than your skill. But by level 10 you level slowly enough to have at least two weapons skills maximized (most people chose 1HS and 2HS).<P>Crafted armor comes from a series of quests, but you have to be around level 30 to do them. For example for Crafted Bracers you need a Sapphire (which you can buy for a little over 100 PP at every jewelery supply shop) and a bunch of optic nerves which drop from the Evil Eye lords in the Gorge of King Xobb. So unless you buy the optic nerves from a caster who camped the Evil Eye lords for a polished bone bracelet, you have problems getting them before level 25 to 30. You can buy Crafted Bracelets on the East Commons tunnel market, but as the Sapphire is already so expensive they cost about 130 to 150 PP each.<P>Warriors get much more hitpoints than clerics. Paladins are hybrids and get less hitpoints than warriors, but more than clerics.<P>Warriors make the same money as clerics, but they only pay for weapons and armor, no expenses for spells. On the other hand warriors are VERY dependant on their equipment, much more than a caster. Get a good weapon first and then armor with the highest AC possible. If you have the choice of an armor with cool looking stats boni and one with higher AC, go for the AC. If possible, even get earrings and rings that increase AC (Jagged bands that give AC plus STR are nice). Your not called a tank for nothing, dress like one.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Put one skill point into Taunt early and start practicising it even if you just solo. A smart warrior is a warrior that knows all the dirty orc jokes to always keep all of the mobs taunted on him.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'd like to add a few things to a few of the answers.<P>3) Until fairly recently, different classes had radically different exp tables, with Warriors needing the least exp to level. This is no longer the case - all classes are now on an even playing field. Other than that, it depends on your skill and style of playing the game. <P>4/5) Every class has a different formula for how many hit points they gain per level. STA has a tiny impact on this formula; if you were to trade in all your WIS gear for STA gear, you might gain 1 more hit point per level. Clerics if I remember correctly gain about 19 hit points per level; Paladins have been increased since I played mine regularly, but I think it's about 28 per level; it's been even longer since I played my Warrior regularly, but I think they started at about 30 per level, with large bonuses at regular intervals.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi, im playing a dwarven warrior right now, and like people said previously they "rock" :O)<P>What you really need as a fighter is a good combo of agi str dx and sta forget iq, forget wis, you will regret having wasted some points in those stats in the future...<P>When choosing items keep only those 4 stats in mind, theres even some cheap items that will give you nice boost like the grotesque mask (+7 dx -9 cha) i think you can get it for like 40 pp and what warrior would care about a -9 cha... <P>I also founded my lumberjack cap (altought its ugly) to be a vey nice item same ac as bronze weight a lot less and gives sta bonus, so thats the kind of equipment you shoulkd be looking for, but overall the main should be STR, STR and STR  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>And as for money LOL forget it, warriors are always broke ! Always changing some piece of armor, changing weapon for a better one etc...<P>Oh and one thing, dont do the mistake ive done previously, get yourself magic boots (i had bronze) so you can kick any creatures!<P>As for skills, try keeping as many weapon as you can maxed, also taunt, kick and bind wound maxed a fighter cant perform witouth those!<P>Did I mention brewing ? lets face it how can a dwarf survive witouth brewing ?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Lots of good replies already. I'll give my thoughts, though they've mostly been covered.<P>As stated, weapon skill increases are based on your Dex. My dwarf started with 90. With gear, I'm at 100 now hehehe... No complaints. You will NOT max all your weapon skills until in your teens, at the absolute earliest. Garanteed. And that's if you twink with the fastest weapons of each class you can come up with!<P>1) Crafted = warrior only quest armor. With a group, you can kill regular evil eyes at 20th or so. With just a partner, you can hold a camp at 24 or 25. As a warrior, I solo'd both evil eye spawns and got XP for every kill at 28. One side only I could do at 26. Most crafted you will be able to get the pieces for in your late 20's, or of course, you can buy it. It's good XP, even in hell levels, so many people do that to help them through and then sell it, often for the price of the gem pretty much.<P>2) ROFL! *gasps for breath* Sorry  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"> Not true. Ask Ordith *evil grin* He's borrowing money from his twinks, so he doesn't feel broke! LOL *holds his sides* You will ALWAYS be trying to upgrade. Saving a couple hundred here or there, selling a piece of armor, buying another. I make more money tailoring and smithing than I EVER have fighting and looting. *shrug* I'm down to under 200PP myself now, after last nights purchases, and cash set aside for another.<P>3) Yes and no. I'd say they're pretty even anymore. Both have limited solo ability, so rely on groups. I can solo a warrior into the 30's because I know what I'm doing, but many would have trouble doing that.<P>4) YES! We have the highest base HP in the game, and the highest increase per level. 30 per level up to 29, then over 100 at 30, etc. WE get regular large boosts as we go. STA affects HP. Again, my dwarf started with 100 STA. No complaints from me. It's sitting at 110 right now.<P>5) Yes, Paladins start higher than casters, but not as high as warriors.<P>6) Friendly, I'd say honestly, that Luclin or 7th Hammer seem to be the friendliest overall. <P>Now, Balkin's guide to being a warrior.<P>1) AC IS EVERYTHING! I'd give up any stat boosting gear, just to get a higher AC. Any day of the week and twice on Sundays. There are so few acceptions to this, that it's almost not worth mentioning, but I will. <P>a)Skull shaped barbute (13ac 35hp 10vs magic) over a crafted helm (14ac 5cha 5wis). Don't argue, just do it.<BR>b)Cloak of the Ice bear (8ac 10hp, 20vs cold), or Lizardscale cloak (ac8 5dex) over a FS plate cloak (10 ac). Plate being one of the more affordable, high ac cloaks available to you. If weight is an issue, the lizy cloak is the lightest.<P>1) STR is number one for a warrior, Agility, Dexterity, and Stamina being tied for second. Many will argue that, but hey, that's their philosophy, and this is mine. I personally love my Dwarf. 20 points into STR, 5 into AGI looks like this.<P>STR 120<BR>STA 100<BR>AGI 80<BR>DEX 90<P>Make sure your AGI is at an absolute minimum, 75. No other stats besides those 4 matter. <P>If you take up trade skills, you want to get WIS items to help you. Your wis starts at 83, and your INT at 60. Much easier to build the WIS.<P>I see a lot of halfling warrior twinks, due to their higher AGI and DEX. Interesting thought, but not sure I'd go for it. They say they get hit less, My logs say it's a very marginal difference at best *shrug*<P>Anyway, that's the basics. Good luck with your new warrior!<P>Balkin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

At higher levels you really start to notice the difference in HP between a low stamina character and a high stamina character.  At higher levels you are a meat shield, there to protect your group, and  if an extra 300HP gives your cleric that little added margin of error on healing you it's a good thing.<P>Fekko of the Scale<BR>Druid of Karana<BR>All around good guy</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Smart warrior! Bah! You need to be strong, fast, hearty, brave, and daring. Leave being smart to those dress wearers. <P>I mean, is Conan smart? Seriously, I agree with almost all that was said here. Because I used the manual as my reference for creating my warrior, I did not put any points in DEX and I wish I had. I started with STA and STR over 100, and put points all over the place. I now have 140+ STR but only 82 DEX (and that is with the Grotesque Mask).<P>I also do use the items Balkin mentioned - Cloak of the Ice Bear and Skull Shaped Barbute. Hell, I do not even know what I need for the Crafted Helm quest.<P>Like everyone else has stated, yes, we are mostly broke all the time. Maybe something changes at some point, but not yet for me. Even if a nice item drops, and we sell it, it is usually just to get an upgrade.<P>I would also like to comment on what Fekko said regarding STA. The Best of the Best for warriors does seem to support his principle that STA is #1. Most of the "Champions" from each server were - Ogres. The race with by far the highest starting STA (132), not to mention the highest STR (140). The end all winner of the BotB was - tada - an Ogre. Considering BotB is mostly for "uber" players, all gear would have been within the relative ballpark of eachother, and in the end the most HP won.<P>Tarelil Aesirborne - lvl 33 Wolf of the North -<BR>&lt;Soul’s Dominion&gt;<BR>Torv</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think there's a real benefit to being smart as a Warrior.<P>If you want rapid skill increases, you'll want high scores in INT, DEX, and AGI (for Defense).  I'd recommend a Dark Elf or Gnome for this.  I play a Dark Elf, and I can vouch for the viability of this combo.<P>You will need to get STR gear as you level (otherwise you won't be able to carry your armour), but STR gear is reasonably easy to find.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I would suggest a troll warrior.  Or in Iksar warrior.  Why?  REGEN.<P>Intelligence?<BR>You don't need this stat.  There will be plenty of time to raise your skills as you level.<P>High strength and high stamina is what you need.  High agility and dexterity is nice as well.<P>Now think about this.  SK's are int casters.  An Erudite SK is a smart mofo.  And he can cast.  AND he can fight...hmmmmm<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think the major issue/argument against Iksar warriors is still that they are a *no plate armor* class. Terrible limitation for a warrior.<P>As far as what I said regarding INT, any race can make a great warrior. In the end though, there are HUGE differences in ability to tank.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum10&number=10&thisthread=006196&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum10&number=10&thisthread=006196&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
