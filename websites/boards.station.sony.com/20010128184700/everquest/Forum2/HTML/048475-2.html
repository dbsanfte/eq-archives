</FONT><HR>Just a sign that the game has been horribly broken from DAY ONE. This is a pretty major change to a game at this late stage. It does nothing to change the fact that the game is too group oriented to the point of punishing many classes.<P>Basically, you need a warrior, rogue, cleric and chanter. Situationally you might want a wiz/druid for evacs or a monk for pulling, but usually you are better off added more clerics and chanters or a druid for dmg shields and regen. <P>Other classes are not necessary and are generally a non-optimal solution. <P>Now since EQ is to group oriented this puts those other classes at a massive disadvantage in high level play (if they ever get there). On top of that, if you are not a member of an uber or semi-uber guild structure, most of the new multigroup content excluded even more players. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wow, that took awhile.  I had to read a great deal of posts on this topic.  I was surprised at the people who are complaining about this stuff.  The seem to be able to be lumped into a couple groups.<P>1.  People who have played Hybrids up and are concerned that the people coming behind them will have an easier time of it.<P>This is, of course, a legitimate complaint; but, if you think about it, you're complaining not because it hurts you; but because something you did is easier now.  Most of you (not all) have complained about the penalty in the past (or about not being able to find a group) -- that problem is gone.  I can't tell you to be happy; but, you should be at least more relaxed -- your grouping problems are over.<P>2.  People bad at math.<P>I've read several people's "expert" math equations that point out how this is all smoke and mirrors.  Um, let's make it simple.  You will get MORE xp for hunting in a group than you did before from the SAME monsters you've been hunting.  If you've been smart enough to learn how to hunt in dungeons that aren't normally full, you'll get EVEN MORE XP.  There is absolutely nothing bad about this.  If you can come up with why getting more xp is worse than getting what you've been getting, I'd be glad to hear your reasoning -- and then snicker at you.<P>3.  People who just don't trust VI.<P>Well, I'm definately not a VAK.  I've played since Beta 3 and have no problem complaining about things when they're broken.  I do give full credit to VI for this change.  I'd be doubtful too; BUT, they gave us the numbers.......this makes things pretty easy to verify post patch.  It'd be dumb of them to do so and then screw us over.  I'm going to have to say that no matter how many times things have gone wrong here, this is probably not going to be one of them.<P>4.  People who think that other people's success makes them less valuable.<P>Just because someone else has something or gets something that you don't doesn't make you ANY worse off than before.  You might suffer a "realitive" power drop; but, not an actual one.  Everything you could do before, you can do now.<P><BR>Thank you VI.  I appreciate the changes and especially the grouping xp bonus as that is the one that directly affects me most.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Now, I am not saying that the changes are a good thing or a bad thing, but they *do* nerf non-hybrid trolls, iksars, and trolls, who now get less XPs in groups than they did before. They get the same XP solo as they did yesterday, but less in groups, which runs counter to V's claim that these changes promote grouping. anyway....<BR>Lets say a troll(1.2 xp mod) shaman (1.0 xp mod) is in a 2-person group with a 1.0 mod character. <P>Yesterday, the troll had a 2% bonus for the group, and a 10% penalty because of his race (20% divided among the group). <P>Today, the troll still has a 2% bonus for the group, but a 20% racial penalty. <P>He now gets 10% LESS XP than he did yesterday for the same kill in the same group (his partner gets 10% more).<P>In a 3 person group, he is nerfed 11 1/3% XP<BR>(+2% extra group bonus -13 1/3% more in <BR>racial penalties)<BR>In a 4 person group, he is nerfed 11% XP<BR>(+4% extra group bonus -15% more in <BR>racial penalties)<BR>In a 5 person group, he is nerfed 10% XP<BR>(+6% extra group bonus -16% more in <BR>racial penalties)<BR>In a 6 person group, he is nerfed 6 1/3% XP <BR>(+10% extra group bonus -16 2/3% more <BR>in racial penalties)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Will he get extra XP since his lost XP will be calculated with diferent numbers?”&lt;<P>Sorry, no.  We thought of that one too, and we’re making sure that doesn’t happen.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  You will get experience upon resurrection based on the way you were receiving experience on death.  So if you die before the patch, resurrection after the patch will give you the same experience return that it would have before the patch.<P>Drysart wrote:<P>&gt;”I believe they've said the new experience system is up on the Test Server right now.”&lt;<P>/em waves at Drysart<P>Yup.  Been up for nearly a week.  Testing the heck out of it.<P>Serril said:<P>&gt;”What two classes have you decided to leave with experience penalties? Hazarding a guess I'd say druids and necromancers, but I'd like to know for sure.”&lt;<P>Actually, we’ve decided to leave the two classes that had bonuses (warrior and rogues) as they were.<P>Saeul said:<P>&gt;”There is still penalty for soloing imposed on all classes except warriors/rogues, but that penalty is now very small (~10%??).”&lt;<P>Nope.  The ‘penalty’ is completely gone.  It doesn’t matter if you group or not, there will no longer be any more experience needed for one class over another, with the exception of the Warrior and Rogue, which will get a slight bonus.  The experience change for hybrids and other over-costed classes is a separate thing from the group experience bonus.<P>Mai029 wrote:<P>&gt;”I think these changes are great Now I can finally have my Pally shout out for a group and not be responded by the ominous sound of Crickets chirping.”&lt;<P>Verant is unfair to crickets.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Mordenkanen,<P>You lose so much experence when you die because of the intense amount of experence you gain on a hell level.  The loss of experence is always a percentage of your total experence.  Using the below as an example, because of the HUGE amount of experence gained at level 30 compared to whats required at 31, your exp "loss" at 31 is only visually disappointing.  Its not a different percentage based loss.<P>I dont guarantee the following is correct, but it sure seems like it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> --<P>Experence to complete a level is done by the following formula (High Elf Cleric for example):<P>exp needed = Level^3 * 100 (CLR Modifier) * 10 (HEF Modifier) * Level Modifier<P>Level Modifier RISES at level 30, 35, 40, and 45, and I think each level 51 and after.  Therefore at level 1, use this formula:<P>1^3 * 100 (Race Modifier) * 10 (Class Modifier) * 1.0 = 1,000 XP needed<P>Hell levels work like this:<P>Level 28: 28^3*100*10*1.0 = 21,952,000 Exp<BR>Level 29: 29^3*100*10*1.0 = 24,389,000 Exp (Dif of 2,437,000)<BR>Level 30: 30^3*100*10*1.1 = 29,700,000 Exp (Dif of 5,311,000)<BR>Level 31: 31^3*100*10*1.1 = 32,770,100 Exp (Dif of 3,070,100)<P>Thats how hell levels work, therefore what you are seeing on 31 is a large VISUAL loss, but your actual loss is static percentagewise based on your race/class.  You require more than 2 times your experence to get through 30 than you do at 29.<P>The way experence is with a warrior/rogue at level 50 vs. a high elf cleric at 50 (XP requirements) are:<P>50 Wood Elf WAR = 50^3*100*9*1.4 = 157,500,000 XP<BR>50 Dwarf ROG = 50^3*100*9.05*1.4 = 158,375,000 XP<BR>50 High Elf CLR = 50^3*100*10*1.4= 175,000,000 XP<P>Therefore, with them not changing the modifier, the Cleric requires a lot more work to get to level 50 than the warrior or rogue, HOWEVER, in my *PERSONAL OPINION* with the headaches of downtime, traveltime, etc involved with a warrior/rogue (No regen HP, rare bind spots, etc), Their bonus doesnt bother me, but thats just me.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>To all of you who are bellyacheing and boo hooing.....stop. i cant believe my eyes. wasted time? it is a game not an investment. it is fun to play. all the time that you were able to play is not wasted that is foolishness. if you enjoy this game as much as i do then all the time you get to play is just that...playtime.honestl the only thing i could see about gripeing about is if eq bugged us all because of negligence of some sort on their fault, and as a big creidit to them that has not happened.<P>(this from part 2 of the closed thread)<P>So as far as you're concerned, you could care less if they did a character wipe to make everyone happy at level 1?  You don't care about the time you invested, you don't care about your character's current status?  You don't care that level 30 took you 4 months and with the same playtime put in a newbie can be level 35 in 4 months after the patch?<P>Let me break this down for your tiny little mind.  You worked at your job for 10 years to become office manager.  Now a person his hired right off the street with no experience and in 1 year he becomes your boss.  You have more worked time, more seniority, and he slides in on top of you?  How would you feel?  Possibly like an incompetent fool who shouldn't be working there in the first place.<P>**************************<BR>This is a general discussion forum.  What is to discuss about this?  The patch will go through.  You aren't going to run it on multipart locked threads only to change your mind.  I doubt very much 5 days is enough time to thoroughly test it on the test server, but since you don't properly test anything else before it goes live it doesn't surprise me.  Discussion is futile.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>drzero: But you can kill mobs a heck of a lot faster with 6 than with 1 or 2. heck, when our guild groups, it is literally non-stop combat.<P>This is true, but in most zones where a group is constantly pulling you'll get to the point where nothing else "out there" is left alive, so you'll have to wait a few minutes here and there for things to respawn. This puts in a limiter to large group "area camping" in most areas.<P>Agnonymous: most of the changes are good. but verant can go to HELL on the group thing. I should be able to do quests solo.<P>You can do some minor quests solo, but the core of EQ is  group-based. We all learn to live with this sooner or later.<P>Bubkuk: Adjust the ZEM (Zone Experience Multiplier) by the number of people in a zone...Create a way for players to find out which zones are not crowded, and currently have the best ZEM?<P>Great idea in theory, but in prectice you'll end up with a bunch of peeps who TP themselves around the world in an effort to min-max their experience. By the time the rest of us non-TP'ers get there, Unrest would have 100 peeps in it and be back down to a ZEM of +0%. Better to just let people know that some zones are better for experience 24/7 while others are better for loot 24/7 and leave the ticker tape out of it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Bouke put this correctly.<BR>.....<P>Solo'ers, still solo, or have a partner and you have to kill twice as much but it evens out with two people. (cleric&war?)<P>or have 6 people, .. nothing in between.<P>Now as for...<BR>&lt;&lt;2 person group - 2% total bonus.<BR>3 person group - 6% total bonus.<BR>4 person group - 10% total bonus.<BR>5 person group - 14% total bonus.<BR>6 person group - 20% total bonus.&gt;&gt;<P>If mob A has 100 xp then...<BR>1 person gains 100 xp per kill<BR>2 people gain 51 xp per kill (100*1.02/2)<BR>3 people gain 35 1/3 xp per kill (100*1.06/3)<BR>4 people gain 27.5 xp per kill (100*1.1/4)<BR>5 people gain 22.8 xp per kill (100*1.14/5)<BR>6 people gain 20 xp per kill (100*1.2/6)<P>So two people have to kill twice as much, 3 almost 3 times, 4 a little less than 4, 5 almost 5 and 6 exactly 5. So if you are smart and can solo this will still be better. Same with a two man group. It's a great change overall, It makes sense, but the bonus is not as big as everyone thinks, and it isn't a nerf to soloing.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I look forward to going into a dungeon and never hearing the words "camp check" again. Droga and Nurga and Kaesora are three of the best dungeons I have ever been in, they are lots and lots of fun to geta  good group and roll through the whole thing, exploring and havinga blast.  The only drawback is the folks who are camping a particular spot for a particular item.

</FONT><HR>I agree with all the changes (except maybe for the warrior/rogues not been treated as the rest of the classes).  What I don't agree with is the % of increase in group exp.  I don't think it will make any difference with the numbers given, soloing will still be by far the fastest way of getting exp.  The new exp bonuses only really make a difference on groups of 4+ members, which means you need to kill 4x times more monsters (which means you have to find 4x times more monsters in same amount of time).<BR>Is grouping more fun? hell yeah!...

</FONT><HR>"just thinking with new increased death exp loss ( hybrids still being penalised moan moan)"<P>*sigh*  Hybrids are NOT being penalized.  Reread the letter again.  Read the following example.<P>Prepatch, a soloing cleric (no penalty) and a soloing prepatch hybrid get the same 100 exp off a low blue.  After the patch, the cleric will still get 100, but the hybrid will get 140 exp.  Now, when they each die, if they both lose 1000 exp, then the cleric will need to kill 10 mobs to get back to where he was, while the hybrid will be back to where he was in between 7 and 8 kills.  <P>This doesn't penalize hybrids, it makes them -even- with everyone else.  It would be -hugely- unfair to everyone else if a bonus was applied to gaining exp but no penalty applied when losing it.<P>This was described with INFINITE detail in the producer's letter.  They made it very clear as to why they did it this way.

I have a question about how this multiplier thing will work though.<P>When I am grouped, say with one person, how will the multiplier work? In other words, is the modifier going to be applied to the total group experience or to only the experience I personally recieve? (Say the creature killed gives 100xp, 1.4x100=140, 140/2=70xp each, now on the other way it looks like: 100/2=50xp for each, but with my modifier MINE is turned into 70 while my partner remains the same)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I believe you are looking at the existing experience penalty as an actual percentage detractor that is applied to all experience gained.  This is not the case.  What IS the case is that in order to progress to a new level, a hybrid needs to have earned 40% more than a cleric would have.  The new 40% offset is free experience designed to make the hybrid gain levels as fast, but there is no detractor on experience gained by a hybrid.<P>This is why the hybrid needs to lose 40% more on death...  he is in actuality gaining 140% of the experience as the cleric right next to him.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Be happy soloing if that's your gig, but regardless of what you may think almost ANY group with competent members is capable or performing better than the sum of its parts.  Add to that the small - but ultimately substantial, long-term bonus, and grouping's much more appealing than it was.

I wish everyone would just realize that Verant would not release information this detailed on an important EQ system and then not make sure it worked.  That would be like telling everyone about some huge quests and then having them not work.  Oh crap, Epic quests.  OK, besides that hehe.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P>My main point though is about the dungeon improvements (the ZEM).  I am very happy with these increases.  However, I know that with one dungeon it isn't going to make a difference.  Kaesora is one of my favorite dungeons, but I have never walked inside without seeing overly-high level players camping the quest key off xalgoz.  Is it possible to move items that high levels would be prone to camping somewhere besides a dungeon you are trying to get people in?  Tonight on E. Marr there were 4 groups of 50+ lined up to get at it.  I am not upset with the people for camping it.  I am upset about it being there in the first place.  Until the motivation for farming is taken out of the dungeons you wish to improve, then these dungeons will always be filled with high-levels camping mobs far beneath them, and as such discouraging younger adventurers who are meant to be there from going to the dungeon in the first place.

</FONT><HR>What the happy people and the people complaining about the people complaining don't seem to notice, is the basic thing thats wrong with these hybrid exp. changes.<BR>Verant always said it was supposed to be harder to play a hybrid, but that it would be worth it in the end. Special abilities, or just the versatility of a hybrid should make it worthwile. Now, instead of making it worthwile they make the playing easier.<BR>So obviously, these changes are not meant to solve the problems of the people playing a hybrid, they are only for the people not playing a hybrid because they didn't want to put the extra effort in the game (those people had no problem though because they can choose a lot of other easier classes), and for the not hybrid players that whined they got a little less exp when grouped with a hybrid (those people will always whine about anything anyway).<BR>The solution to the problem should have been: 1. fix it so other people don't suffer from inviting a hybrid to their group, and 2, give the hybrids something back for the extra time they have to put in advancing their characters. Then everyone can chose for themselves what would be the right class for them to play, and the people that choose the harder way would have been rewarded in the end.<BR>The current changes will just make the game a lot less challenging for the people who wanted a real challenge =(</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think racial penalties should continue to be shared across the group. Unlike hybrid penalties(which had no relationship to grouping value), racial penalties DO indeed help the group. <P>Racial exp penalties should be shared for 2 reasons:<P>1)Non-exp-penalty races get hurt in pickup groups.<P>A Troll shaman will benefit the group more than a Barb will. <BR>An Iskar monk offers more to the group than a human monk. <BR>An ogre warrior helps the group more than a gnome warrior.<P>In all of these cases, it is adventageous for one to select the exp-penalty race in their group even though they would have to share some of that exp.  The better races will lower group downtime and thus the group will get more exp overall, negating the exp loss to other members of the group.<P>This makes xp penalty races MORE popular to group with(at least in pick-up groups) than non-penalty races. This is because the person without the exp penalty gets the benefit of grouping with the exp-penalty of the race, but no downside.<P>Why group with a human monk over an iskar? Before, the iskar would take some of your exp, but his natural regen and AC bonuses made it worth it. But with these changes, there is no reason not to choose an iskar over a human to group with, since there is no trade-off for grouping with one.  The iskar benefits you more, but now you don't have to pay for the benefit you are getting.  <P>If I'm a human monk, I now bring no advantage to a pick-up group over an Iskar.<P>2)This change hurts tight-knit groups that try to keep everyone together in exp as closely as possible.<P>I have one char that I only play once a week with 5 friends.  This is a dungeon-crawling, well balanced group.  It does everything Verant expects people to do under "The Vision".<P>Unfortunately for me, this char happens to be the only one in the group with a racial penalty. This means that in order for me to keep pace with the other group members, I will have to either solo or be powerleveled to keep pace with the other members.  I think that making me do this to keep up with the group goes exactly against "The Vision".  My friends would prefer to share my exp with me, and I don't really want to solo this char or be power-leveled.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>While I aggree about the intent of these new rules, it dose address a grouping issue with hybrids that have seriously harmed them in the past. I have a few questions that I would appreciate the answers to.<P>#1 - Does the additional exp only apply when the hybrids is grouped. If they solo do they still recieve a exp bonus per kill?<P>#2 - It seems to me that the new rules are very much a death nerf to Hybrids. Am I wrong?? here is my logic for thinking that.<P>OLD RULES:<BR>-Group kills mob<BR>-Hybrid still receives extra exp per kill....albeit extra exp is taken from other members in group.<BR>-Group gets wiped out everyone loses same exp.<BR>- Group resumes killing hybrid will regain lost exp faster because he/she gets more exp per kill while group members gain exp back slower because exp taken from them. <BR>New Rules:<BR>-Hybrid still gets the same exp per kill... albeit not by penalizing other group members.<BR>- Group gets wiped out... Hybrid loses MORE exp then others, but will regain the lost exp at exactly the same rate as if they were grouped using the old rules. <P>The way I see it the net result is a death will mean it will take much more kills for the hybrid to make up then current rules. What about the Hybrids who gets ambushed/killed while traveling or doing a CR or death by LD. These would now be major hazards for them especially considering that they are performing hazardous tasks that have no chance of exp gain. <BR>Again I could be misinterpreting the changes so a clarification would be very much appreciated.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The way I understand the change is that any class with a penalty (particularly hybrids) will gain more exp per kill. The game will create exp out of thin air to give the character whenever he kills something grouped or otherwise. <P>If cleric X gets 100xp for a kill then pally Y will get 140XP for the same kill. Let's say a group of 6 kills a mob that gives each person in the group 100 base xp. (I'm &gt;NOT&lt; factoring the grouping bonuses or race penalties)<P>Ok Cleric X gets 100 exp, Pally Y gets 140 exp, Chanter Z gets 110 exp, Warrior A gets 100 exp,<BR>Rogue B gets 100 exp, and Druid C gets 100 exp.<P>Now, let's say we have a TPW (Total Party Wipeout)<P>Cleric X loses 100% of the base number of exp he'd lose for his lvl, Pally Y loses 140% of the base number of exp he'd lose for his lvl, Chanter Z loses 110% of the base number of exp he'd lose for his lvl, Warrior A loses 100% of the base number of exp he'd lose for his lvl, and the same goes for rogue B and Druid C, they'd lose 100%.<P>Now about lvling. Rogues and warriors only need 90% the exp everyone else does. so if characters X,Y,Z,C need 100,000 exp to lvl, characters A and B only need 90,000 exp unless my brain is foggy today.<P>The bonus exp races with previous penalties got does not come from anywhere. **&gt;&gt;IT IS MADE OUT OF THIN AIR.&lt;&lt;** If you need a better answer, I had a magician summon it out of his hat. If only he could summon boats then we could avoid the wait at the docks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There is one part that I don't understand:<BR>"Since everyone currently loses experience as if they are a warrior of their own race, we do not want anyone to lose more relative experience(e.g. experience such that recovery from death is more difficult).  Hence, we further multiply the experience loss on death by the class experience modifier for warriors(0.9).<P>OK you lost me on this.  Does this mean that after xp loss has been modified by any xp penalty for INT based casters or hybrids that all xp loss for death is then multiplied by 0.9, where it wasn't before?  What do you mean "Everyone currently loses experience as if they are a warrior of their own race"?  Do you mean that everybody currently loses the same xp as anybody else of the same race?  Or was there already some distinction of "Losing experience as if they are a warrior"?  Because from what I interpret from what you said, Warriors and all other classes from the same race lost the same amount of xp if they were the same level.<P>If I am a warrior and I used to lose,say for example, 1000 experience points on death, do I now lose 900?  Or did I already lose 900 and now everybody else's loss is now multiplied by .9 as well?<P>Sorry but this part wasn't worded well, or was not explained properly.  Everything else made good sense.<P>Mysharra<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>In all of the posts I have read, the talk has always been concerning exp. given as the result of killing a mob/npc.  What about quest exp ? I am assuming that quest exp was done the same way for hybrids ( they paid a penalty ).  Will you now award a bonus out of thin air for quest exp.  Or am I wrong ?  Was there never an exp penalty for hybrids with respect to quest exp ?<P>Thanks in advance for any response.<P>Gilgalon Inglorien<BR>Ranger of the 41st Season<BR>Council of Discord<BR>Vallon Zek<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>just read all three threads on this topic... took me just over 4 hrs... hehe. This change is absolutely great! I am a very green player, been only playing EQ since November 2000, and I was getting worried about the exp. minus my paladin had, since I loved the idea of a holy warrior. Now, I can go back to him again, and not worry about that screwy exp. thing anymore.
