</FONT><HR>This is the way it is.<P>The characters are unbalanced.  Some are reaching the point of redundancy, have been ignored by the design team, and really in many ways don't offer many advantages over some classes in the same 'category'.<P>Wizards, Rangers, Monks.<P>1000's of lvl 50+ Wizards, Rangers, and Monks, who play these classes as their primary characters, agree.<P>A viewpoint that kinda seems to be emerging is that these are 'secondary' or 'support' characters.  If so why didn't you mention it in the manual or something?  Something like, 'Rangers and Monks, like the farmer and merchant class, are difficult to play and not very powerful.  However they can be interesting to play.'  Or, 'Wizards, due to their narrow view of magic, never really reach the depths of power some of the other magic-users do.  As such, they are best suited as lackeys to powerful Necromancers and Druids.'  Then of course, it would be my fault for choosing to play one...<P>And don't tell me that the fantastic advantages to these classes are the 'role playing possibilities'.  <P>So wakey wakey, Verant are not the gods of game design!  As much as some VAK's might want to believe that everything is fine, there is a purpose and reasoning behind the current rules/design, it's not.  The hard truth is that tens of thousands of paying players have dissected this game in and out, more so than a team of a half a dozen programmers ever could.  Case in point..Moss Covered Twig.  How did that even get into the game?  Throw a list of all the EQ equipment on a table in front of 6 seasoned EQ players, and they would pick that out in a heartbeat as unbalancing, even without testing.  Yet somehow this, and the barbed scale whip, got in.<P>Sure this is a great game, but it could be made so much better and one of the ways is through improving class balance.  <P>YES THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE WRONG.<P>As far as the monk holding off the hordes and saving the group?!  Uh, no.  You know how hard it is to successfully feign with more than one mob on you, in close range? How are you even going to attract all the mobs onto you without taunt?  And do you know how few hps monks have?  Even if you meet the first two conditions, you might buy your group an extra second or two.<P>Rant off,<BR>Chrome</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Some things some morons seem to be forgetting here... Verant mentionned FD pulling was NOT a monks purpose. <P>Abashi said about monks utility: TO inflict the best toe to toe damage dealing PENDING ON APPROPRIATE EQUIPMENT.<P>now the only true monks damage weapons are :<BR>TOn pos staff of understanding<BR>Rune fighter staff<BR>Tranquil staff<P>Lets anylize those closely...<P>TOn po staff of understanding =<BR>damage 44 delay 40  procs 100 blows<BR>Dropped off = Trakanon<BR>Reminder for ignorants = Trakanon has a loot pool of I heard 130 items, dropping about 4 items every time with a particular preference for classes Bp. So what are the odds of a monk getting that staff in his life?  Close to 0.1 %<P>Tranquil staff<BR>damage 29 delay 30 procs a 110 damage spell that stuns for about 12 secs.<BR>Dropped off = Skeletal warlord (RARE) in KARNOR castle <BR>Drop rate = close to none <BR>Average number of staff of servers = 4<BR>Facts for ignorants = Half of them are in the possession of monks. Monks have weight limit of 14. this staff weights 10, remember to include a tinkerers bag AT LEAST of 1 pound. so leaves 3 pounds for ALL equipment. ALso keep in mind this staff is close to THE RAREST DROP IN THE GAME. Usually traded for 150 k of stuff, and remember monks have a VERY BIG PROBLEM ACCUMULATING LOOT DUE TO WEIGHT PENALTY. I have seen 1 of those staff on the server was in the possession of a monk twink. Thank you Verant for not making it No drop and yes id rather see one rot than 1 in the possession of a twink.<P>Rune fighter staff<BR>Damage 19 Delay 20<BR>Dropped = In Old sebilis level 50+ zone In the disco (one of the most dangerous part. <BR>By = Frenzied Scarab a RARE mob that drops the rune fighter staff as his RARE drop.  (Why a staff is THAT rare in such a difficult and powerful place is beyond belief)<BR>Drop % = just a little higher than tranquil staff<BR>number on servers = around 10<BR>Half of them in monks possesion or close.<BR>Tradable for around 100 k in items. <BR>Of course, not no drop so tradable to any TWINK. (saw 2 of those yet, 1 in possesion of a monk, another of a twink monk).<P>So now maybe some of you idiots (Abashi included) will think twice before saying "monks only need to get their best weapons" and make it sound like a walk in the park. THe rate drop on these weapons are close to NON EXISTANT AND ITS IN VERY BURLY DUNGEONS. Why oh why is the drop rate so freakin rare? And the excuse: "Well we dont wanna see every monks with one of those" DOESNT HOLD A CANDLE, ITS NOT EVERY MONK THAT HAS THE POWER TO GO GET ONE OF THOSE STAFF! <P>Damn it Verant, you give us weapons but put so many restrictions on them that they aint getable!<P>And btw people Abashi meaning of properly equipped monk is a monk with full set of POS, Veeshan peak and wherever the hell monk armor that aint gettable with one of those HORRIBLY rare weapons.  Im still wondering why he still doesnt understand why he looks like a complete morons everytime he says : "Monks rock". <P>So I ask you, how do you want a monk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>not to nitpick, but if there's a rogue and a monk in a group, the rogue will outdamage the monk if they both know the dynamics of grouping with a rogue.  I think that this is the way it should be.  However, I still think monks need an increase in h2h damage.  that post by chickenlegs or whatever his name is, is something that would please me immensely, and I don't think it would unbalance a thing (his post about Gordon's response to monks).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I have not played?  I have played every single class in the game, thanks.  You have taunt because its usefull at lower levels.  You have almost the same defense as the other hybrids pre-50, but it was obvious to me even before Kunark that a chain-based class with full double and dual attack was geared more to offense than defense.  Are you just now figuring this out?<P>Oh, and I play with a high level ranger at times, and he does just fine thanks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Cerra:<P>And paladins and SK's are more geared toward defense, right?<P>So why, sir, did pallies and SK's get a good 60% of our own increases in offense, while we got 0% of their increase in defense?  On top of the fact that our armor already has significantly less AC?<P>If you actually looked at the pre50 and post50 skill caps, I think you'd rethink your stance.  Pallies and SK's went up (these are rough approximations, understand) about 40-50 points in defense and 20-30 points in offense.  Rangers went up 40-50 points in offense and ZERO in defense.  All other classes also got TONS more parry, dodge and riposte - we got ZERO.<P>A naked level 60 rogue next to a naked level 60 ranger will have 150 more AC.  NOT A PALADIN, NOT A SHADOW KNIGHT, NOT A WARRIOR.  A rogue.  <P>I fully disagree with Abashi's statement that we are equal to monks and rogues in defensive capability now.  Not even close.  Hell, I'd be DELIGHTED to get rogue defense - their cap is now 250, and ours is 200, while our armor class has the same ac and is chain based on both counts.  But we're not asking for that.  Rangers are only asking for 220 or so!  And the same sort of proportions to parry, dodge and riposte.<P>We are not asking to be equal to pallies and sk's.  We are asking that we get the same percentage increase relative to theirs in defense that -they- got to our offense.<P>That is NOT unreasonable, no matter how much you want to paint it as such. <P>Qwinn Windfletcher<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>What pisses me off about the way rangers have to play in the current environement, is that they have nothing to help a group more than any other class.  They no longer can take ANY damage, they much worse at taking damage than even a monk.  <P>So they are a support class in Kunark.  This means they are not to take damage, only to help with their spells and some damage.  A druid can do EVERYTHING a ranger can do for a group, and do it MUCH better.<P>Ranger does melee and spell damage but druid does a lot more damage with spells, and since neither one can take damage, there is very little difference in that role.<P>Druids can cast every spell a ranger does and a lot more.  They can evac too.  They even out track a ranger.<P>The point is, a Ranger does far less damage than any of the pure melee types, and have FAR less defense and lower hp than any other melee type.  Their spells are not even up to par with the other hybrids who get up to level 49 spells of their parent classes, but rangers don't get spells past the druids 39 spell list.  They get a little more offensive melee skills, but FAR less defense skills with inferior armor.<P>I'm more than possitive that any ranger in the current environment would take a few less offensive skill points to that of even the other hybrids to have equal defensive skills.  The Ranger, inferior in every way to a hybrid, but closer in defense would still be far more useful to a group than their current state.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>You guys just need to remember Gordon doesnt have first hand knowledge of the majority of EQ.  He gets this info from 3rd parties, hardly any of it from seeing/testing himself.  Hence some of the more ridiculous and ludicrous responses he has given in the past.  He does have a necro, so his responses are somewhat pro-himself, but any other class he speaks without reason.<P>Yes, life would be much better for Gordon if he  admit some things were wrong when they are wrong instead of waiting for Verant 2 years later to find out it's wrong.<P>But I also see that Gordon is just a barrier to impede people from getting the truth akin to  someone who is trying to stop you from reaching the other side of a bridge.  So next time you see Gordon, you shake his hand and said Good Job at what you are doing.. then slap on a "Kick Me" post it on his back  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Cerra,<BR>What you dont seem to understand is that after 86days logged on as a ranger, i now have to play my character in a TOTALLY new way, not even remotly similar to what i used to do, even pre 45. <BR>Am i supposed to be offensively geared? yes thats why i gave up the AC/HPs for the plate wearing classes, am i supposed to be a "light tank" who avoids blows most of the time but gets hit hard when he does get hit, yes, is this what is happening post 45lvl? NO.  Does that explain it better for you? Im not trying to be a smart arse but until you have put in the time yourself you really shouldnt evaluate what people who have lots more time logged in on a class then yourself are saying about THEIR class.  In this case more time=better understanding. <BR>Example lvl 49, fighting a green skele in dreadlands.  I reposed/parried or dodge 2 times the whole fight, being hit for 80+, by a green mob.  that means two blows avoided do to my light tank status, and countless blows landed for 70-84.  Only 2 defensive skills the whole fight?

</FONT><HR>I just wanted to get back to what Abashi used as his reasoning that things must be balanced, because everyone is complaining.<P>First, if all the customers that attend a certain restaurant order food, get billed for that food, but didn't get served all the food they paid for, they're going to complain.  Just because they all complain, doesn't mean every food order must have been served correctly.  It does not work out that if everyone says something, it must be the opposite.  At least in the real world -- how you all handle yourselves at Verant HQ might be a different story.<P>And if this restaurant is the only one in town then, occasionaly, people are going to eat there despite the bad service.  It's a monopoly.<P>As applied to EQ, just because every class complains, does NOT indicate that they must therefore be in some kind of logical balance.  The only thing balanced is everyones' feelings that Verant has broken things and ignored complaints.<P>EQ enjoys a monopoly now -- most people prefer a non-PvP game, and right now EQ is the only one offering such a online 3D beast.  Well, Diablo II did cut into that, didn't it?  Just wait for the other RPG 3Ds to come.  But, for now, you all have some breathing room.  Luckily for players, not too much.  <P>Secondly, if you get as many complaints as you say, doesn't that clue you in that there are problems?  I realize Verant claims a large userbase, but aren't 90% of your board enough complaints for you to take it seriously? <P>Lastly, about the closing of these Official boards to non-current players -- I bet you all thought that was a necessary, or even brave, step.  But using your own ideas, I guess if you all agreed on it, it must really have been pretty cowardly and not necessary after all.<P>Now that's something I can agree with.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well I disagree that this is the case. Perhaps 90% of the ones on this board claim otherwise, but that doesn't represent 90% of the actual population. Please keep in mind that I see complaints in varying numbers from week to week from every class claiming that they aren't balanced. Is everyone correct? If everyone is correct that their class is unbalanced in a negative way, doesn't that in fact mean that they are balanced? The later is a philosophical question.<P><BR>Uh, bud, i was under the impression you were somehow an official here.  And this is the best you could come up with? "perhaps here, but, duh, i doubt there.  And SINCE I doubt it, it can't be, so there!!"  I mean, are you insinuating that there arent any more *****es from one class than another? and if, as  i presume to be the case, there ARE more from one particular class or even to apply the logic inversely, less from one particular class, wouldnt that be to say that there ARE problems?  can u say you have more playing time or analysis than the thousands of rangers (for the sake of this thread, as i am a ranger) that DO seem to think there is a problem?  what audacity.  btw, lets REALLY break it down here.  this is OUR game, WE bought it, and WE'LL tell you what to do to continue getting paid.  what REALLY pisses me off is as a newbie til level 30 or so, i defended verants stance in the innoncent naivety i was prone to. and now after investing SO much of my time in my char, and most of time joyfully so, i have less and less fun, spend more and more time wishing my ranger was different.  wishing my ranger was a bit more independent, as was what a ranger was, i thought when i created him.  an independent, outdoors, tough, lithe, and deadly persona that, by the time he reaches maturity, will be strong enough to at least make most want to consider leaving him alone.  instead, ive had to forget what soloing something thats my peer (that IS what an even con is to insinuate is correct?) will ever feel like again.  yeah, if i lost half the time, id consider it par.  but no, the odds of my totally self sufficiently killing any mob my level or with in 5 levels, hell, 8 if itsa caster, is pretty much void.  and now im to understand your main is a necro?  interesting...  on the Necro note, ive been beat dueling by necros, without a pet, 6 levels beneath me.  Very Balanced class there....  i guess its our fault though, your right, we should ALL have been nercros......<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Gordon,<BR>Please remove the rose colored glassed that you use to view the game and take a look at the real numbers. I have several points to make since they will be intelligently put and not full of profanity I am sure you will not read this post.<P>1. Question on the live testing team. By what means do you test class balancing? Make up characters with the appropriate class, and assign differing levels? 10, 20, 45, 55? is this the way you check out class balancing?<BR>2. Have you ever played the Game on a live server? I think not otherwise you might be a bit more perceptive to the people that the problems or a shortcoming they have encountered in the game playing 100’s of hours.<P>Gordon I would also like to know where you received your training. Your selective sight seems to be a rather wonderful skill is there any way that I can learn it? Monday a wonderful post was made by SunMoon, he backed his argument with logic some hard numbers and sound research methodology. You have yet to respond to the well though out posts supporting that one. Yet you respond to the ones that allow you to dismiss complaints with "you don't know the game comments". I am glad you are able to support the Pro Verant movement.  This was how Ultima Online’s PR guy reacted to many posts. I believe that many of their former customers are now playing EQ. If we receive the same smokescreens when the next game comes out you will most likely be playing second or third to the new game… I hear UO hast lost lots of revenue.<P>In closing I helped to beta test this game, we were listened to our cases heard and measures were taken to correct things. We came to expect this type of support. It is sad that it is not the case anymore. Oh and one last thing Rangers = ¾ fighter ¼ druid, if that is the case why the hell should we be equal to a Rogue as a tank? That is the most idiotic answer I have seen. Rogues are not melee class Rangers are!<P>Araglais Dunedain<BR>Ranger until I Die<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Saying 'everyone whines about class balance' doesnt mean that some classes arent balanced.<P>As to the monks efficacy in a group, the only reason people want monks is for feign pulling, something which you guys feel shouldnt even exist.

He'll send in the pet, stack a DoT or three, and Fear, then turn and write up a few replies, assuring us that Rangers and Monks are perfectly balanced and that there are compelling reasons to play them over other particular classes in particular situations.

</FONT><HR>I mourn the loss of mathematical ability and deductive reasoning on today's youth.<P>Cerra, you can not say taking from defense and giving to offense is balanced.  You simply can not infer that!  If they were increased/decreased proportionally, that would be fine.  But it has and will again be shown to not be true.  Taking from defense 3 times and giving to offense once, I'm sure you would agree, would take a balanced class and render it unbalanced.<P>It drives my insane to see simple minded folks push rubbish onto these boards and flex there pro-Verant muscles.  The 'Verant, I'm with you because I'm so much smarter than these buffoons who think they have actual concerns' stance is almost as frustrating as Verants white-washed poor customer service policy.  I've quit playing my Ranger, and if they become some Uber class, they'll do it without me.  I'm playing a necro now as a primary and blowing through levels like a madman...cake class.  <P>Want proof to the plight of the ranger?  Try to auction off your ranger equipment.   After over a week in ecommon, I was finally able to get 500 for my Ivy Etched Tunic.  The market for Ranger equipment is bottoming out fast...if things ever do get fixed, there are plenty of baby ranger twinks that will take advantage of it.<P>Personally, my character of choice for every game I have played has been a Ranger.  I have never had the troubles I had in EQ.  Even when it was a week class I was able to overcome and have fun.  EQ Rangers are not fun.

</FONT><HR>Hey guys,<P>Well I have to say at first glance I was finding the arguement here hard to swollow. I play a level 30 ranger, and honestly, I love it. I wish my tuant was more effective from time to time but on a whole I like the class. So I see something about Rangers being unbalanced and think "what the...their kiddin right?". However, after reading through everything here, I realize you are basically saying that Rangers are fine or even great....untill you hit level 50, then the problems start. The way I am gettin it is that rangers are basically balanced on offense and deffense pre-50, increasing at a proportional ratio, and that post-50 only the offensive side goes up?? tell me it ain't so. If it is, you are effectively UN-balancing a balanced class. If you were a professional runner, with highly developed legs, who was reentering training for the new season would you only work out with one leg?? Of course not you have a balanced machine each side doing it's job, only exercising ONE side throws off the balance.<BR> This news scares me as I am having a blast with my ranger now, I still solo a lot (in fact enough that some of my guild members are surprised I have gotten as far as I have) but I solo by choice. Gettin a gruop is only as hard if there are no people in the zone I want to fight in. I have continuously been tank for many groups, even ones in which I was by far the lowest level character there. All this though is speaking in the context of a level 30 ranger. My fear comes with the idea that at 50, while my friends run on to finish the marathon, I will be left in the breakdown lane limping on an underdevoloped limb.

</FONT><HR>I honestly can't think of a possible niche that a Ranger fills better than any other class in EQ.  For any situation that I can think of, I believe that there is another class that performs better in that situation.  IMO, this means to me that there is a problem post lvl 50.  Basically when I bought Kunark I got next to nothing for my money.  I went from a positive contributor to my groups to a hinderance.  From 51 to 60 there is a serious problem with rangers, and someday you guys will finally get around to fixing that problem.<P>1.  Primary Tank.<BR>Warriors, Paladins, Shadowknights, Monks and Rogues are all better Primary tanks.  Monks and Rogues both have much higher AC than similarly equipped Rangers at high lvls.  Unless a Ranger is the ONLY melee class in the group, then they should not be the primary tank.  They are quite frankly the worst of all the melee classes at tanking.  This is new as of Kunark.  Before Kunark I was often the main tank in my group with a monk.  Rangers are #6 in this role.<P>2.  Puller.<BR>Monks and SKs obviously make the best pullers because of their ability to Feign.  A Warrior is #3 because Evasive and Defensive are just absolutely amazing when pulling multiple mobs, and their hit points and AC allow them to tank multiple high lvl mobs long enough for Enchanters to Mez or another class to root and back away from that mob.  At best you'd rate Rangers at #4 because traking makes it easier to pull once the spawn is broken, but it doesn't make you a better puller.<P>3.  Pulling in outdoor zones<BR>You would think that a ranger would be the best at this, but it's not true.  In fact a BARD is the best because they are way way faster than rangers.  I've been in situations with multiple groups pulling the same types of mobs and it seriously sucks to track a mob and find the bard already is pulling it back because he beat you to it.  Rangers are #2 in this role.<P>Secondary Tank/Damage Dealer.<BR>Well Monks, Rogues, and Warriors all deal more damage than a ranger.  If I want a secondary damage dealer all three of those classes are better.  Rangers are #4 in this role.<P>Scout.<BR>Rogues are the undisputed kings of this.  Sneak/hide is amazing at high lvls and lockpick is also helpful.  Monks are better because of Feign death as well.  At best Ranger is #3, but sadly a Warrior in Full kunark armor will have all the special abilities of a Ranger so that will drop us to #4 eventually.<P>Support Spells.<BR>Well Paladins are clearly the king of this.  At high lvls they can take over some of the buffing that a cleric does and Superior healing is fairly effecient.  Much more so than the Greater heal of a ranger.  Paladins are just about a lvl 50 cleric when they hit lvl 60.  The only significant thing they can't do that a cleric can at that lvl is complete heal.  I'll rate Rangers as #2 here.<P>There is just nothing that a ranger can do best, and they aren't good enough in general to really be sought after.  This game has boiled down to around 4 or 5 almost essential classes (Clerics, Enchanters, Warriors, and Rogues).  Then you need an evacer and you are set.  Clearly the weakest of all the classes in the game are the three hybrids.  In a rush to give pure melee classes something to be happy about in the expansion, the hybrids were left out in the cold.<P>Of the three pure melee's Monks got the least, but in relation to hybrids they got a lot.  Their damage table is so much higher that it's ridiculous compared to hybrids.  And the ability to feign death pull always makes them attractive.  Take that away and they would be completely one dimensional and would drop down to the hybrid level of poopiness.<P>Laters,<P>Charron the Scaled Claw<BR>Lvl 53 Ranger of Tunare<P>Fumin Drachejager<BR>Lvl 56 Warrior of Rallos Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>&lt;&lt;&lt;Abashi says: this is for players to figure out&gt;&gt;&gt;<P>Abashi the players HAVE figured it out. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to play this game. The players figured out exactly what rangers are talking about.  THERE IS NO NICHE for them high up.  More melee classes can outdamage rangers, and ALL melee classes have superior defense.  There is NO circumstance that would warrant a ranger over ANY other melee class in the high end zones.  PERIOD. Now please don't make it seem as if we players are "missing" something when you say "figure it out for yourself."  NO ONE at Verant has played a ranger MORE than me. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Look im sorry to the monks out there of an opposite opinion but when you are quadding for 60s with the highest haste cap in the game and kicking every 3(?) seconds for over 100 damage I think you are doing plenty of damage.<P>Secondly, you tank better than rangers with more defensive skills and equal hitpoints. Your huge DEFENSE skill evens out the AC if not give you an advantage in AC along. Rangers defense is the EXACT same a druid, capped at 200.<P>Monks have a lot to offer to a group, and more to the point, you GET groups. No one groups with a ranger because they can snare (sk, nec, bard have snare + dmg or snare + atk speed debuff, druids have longer lasting slower snare, and every caster in the game can root) SoW? Come on as if that gets us a group. One word. Jboots. Direct Damage? You quad for 60s. I take 3 seconds out (2 combat rounds.. maybe 300 damage for a monk on average?) to cast a possibly resisted spell that does 99 damage. Yeah that helps so much against a mob with 10,000hp...<BR>Dot? BWHAHA and HA. Im using stinging swarm. 120 damage and overwrites a druid spell. By 60 i get the level 24 druid DoT Creeping Crud.. maybe 250 damage? Shadowknights have two stackable lines of DoTs and at 60 they can do 2000 dmg with them, on top of life drains which nuke for more than a ranger's not to mention the fact that they heal the SK.<BR>WTF are monks complaining about?! Boohoo you have to camp for a weapon. I've been camping for every single thing that I have since phase 4 beta. And I still can't kill a green. Today in sol B I saw a barehanded (no, no weapon) monk SOLOING the right bat room in Sol B for xp!! He was level 51. I won't be able to do that at level 55.<P>Monks have known what they were ever since you created one. Rangers have undergone a role change from a balanced tank (slightly more offense for slightly less defense) to a useless peice of crap that sits at the zone edge begging for a group. (not ONE point of increase in defensive skills, and only a total of 30 points (offense + weapon skill) in difference between a paladin.<P>Skill.........Ranger.............Paladin & SK<BR>..............Pre50/post50.......Pre50/post50<BR>Weapon........200/240............200/225<BR>Bash............-/-..............175/200<BR>Defense.......200/200............200/230<BR>Dodge.........137/137............125/155<BR>Kick..........149/205..............-/-<BR>Parry.........185/185............175/205<BR>Riposte.......150/150............175/200<BR>Offense.......200/240............200/225<BR>Dbl Atk.......200/235............200/235<P>In fact rangers have fallen 83 combat skills behind their hybrid counterparts. If we were going to be offensively oriented then where is our damage? If we are going to be light tanks where are our skills for wearing light armor? Thats the philosophy for giving monks and rogues the best defensive skills in the game alongside warriors isn't it?<P>Rangers have neither damage nor tanking ability. Every melee has some role in this and are good and bad at these to varying degrees. Monks have the BEST dmg and weaker defense for instance. Rangers have the WORST defense and are tied for the worst damage. How are we of any use to a group? Go camp an item. At least your's still drop. You hear about the drop rate nerf on the swarmcaller yet? <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I can't speak for Monks (since I never played that class) but as for Rangers, I KNOW they need fixing.  Not only do I know this, but it seems everyone else does too!  Heck, even people who have never played a ranger know this.  They have probably been in a sufficiently balanced and skill full group, and still know that rangers are FUBAR!!!!  Stop smoking that Vision(tm) Crack, and at least test some of these ideas.  Isn't that what the friggin test server is for?  Swallow some of that missplaced pride and admit that this issue could possibly, on an outside chance, require some looking into.  I can't beleive your stubborn insistance that everything is okay.  You're worse than my 4 year old when I try to get her to eat her vegetables (and I look forward to that task more than dealing with your high handed approach to customer service and relations).<P>I see that a lot of the more intelligent posts that I told all the folks in my guild to read have been deleted.  You know that this commonly came to be referred to as the Ranger's Flameplay forum.  We are a united community (with many backers from other communities), and we want to make sure that you hear our LEGITTIMATE concerns.<P>Sorry that I'm rambling, but I'm just so mad that blood vessles keep popping in my head and derailing my train of thought!
