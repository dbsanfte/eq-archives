</FONT><HR>A few comments and ideas...<P>Warriors are extremely item dependent. This is neither good nor bad, but it's true. While other classes sift through their spellbook AND their item collection, we can only prepare differently for a battle by changing out equipment. <P>This is compounded by the fact that we have absolutely no variety in the skills we use during a combat... Taunt, Slam(if you have it or until kick stuns), Disarm (for the hell of it, might aggro the MOB more). Positioning our character and timing the use of these scarce few skills is ALL we have to differentiate ourselves from other warriors.<P>Since the taunt skill itself is fairly useless at higher levels, this also means that the only effective method of taunting is through weapon selection. This forces higher level warriors into a narrower selection out of the pool of weapons out there, which sadly leaves many of the better two handed weapons unused (have you EVER heard a warrior seriously consider using the epic as the two handed version?).<P>So without proposing an exact solution, here's some things that could help:<P>Give big hits more staying power on the MOBs hate list. Make two handed weapons viable at higher levels, and make the bigger hitting, higer delay one handers useful.<P>Create some variety to the taunt skill. Give us more strategic choices. Introduce a higher taunt that has a negative such as an attack debuff, introduce a faster one that has less chance of working... Who knows, it's up to you to determine what has the least impact to the game engine, but as this is our class defining skill (keeping the MOBs on us) it would be nice to have some variety to it.<P>One other idea... a few folks have been requesting that certain shields be back equipable.

Would be like dual wield - once you have the skill you can put the item there. This would add a HUGE amount of variety to the viable equipment for warriors. It would allow non-large race warriors to bash without a major tradeoff in damage, and it would give a hefty AC boost to make up for the damage and taunt issues of two handed weapons.

</FONT><HR>I don't know if anyone has suggested this yet (or if it's even possible), but what I would like to see is a little more running speed.<P>Think about this.  A warrior's primary role is to tank.  When a pull goes bad, the warrior should be the one holding off the mob while the rest of the party buggs out.  When we do this, we have nobody left to support us with heals, buffs, roots or what have you.  All we see on our way to the zone is:  you are hit, you are hit, you are hit, LOADING, PLEASE WAIT.  I have never been able to distance myself from a mob without SoW.<P>My second reason for this is:  Warriors secondary function should be the puller.  We go out looking for the mob, putting ourselves at a high risk by venturing into an enemy stronghold just to pull a (hopefully) single mob worthy of our party's attention.  It isn't much fun when you die because you're getting smacked all the way back to the party's location.<P>As a class who relies on strength and endurance, we should have just a little more speed than the more frail classes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Man do I hate it when the selfishness from the games seeps into these boards.<P>I think the best thing to do is go through with a text editor and everytime you see the words POST 50 delete them.<P>Taunt - Needs major work from lvl 40 up and improvement across the board.<P>Disarm- Needs work from the day we get it lvl 35. At no time does it ever do anything sides give us a button to mash. Mobs should lose some effectiveness (damagewise) when disarmed, also a slight stun would make sense since we've just disarmed the mob.<P>Bind wound - needs to go to 200 and should be allowable to 75ish%. We're warriors we spend our lives getting beat on we shold have some clue how to patch ourselves up.<P>Regen Pipe dream here but should be raised imo 1hp per a tick for every 10 levels starting with 30. A high lvl caster can go from oom to fm in 12ish minutes it shouldn't take us 45 to get to full life.<P>Skills from 36-50, actually 26-50 since all we get is disarm at 35 which is proven useless. I really do think something to raise our base stats here would be intelligent, Casters get better med at 35 we should get something that makes us more effective.<P>Sitting and healing - why is it I can't turn my head while sitting? I can't count the number of times I've been jumped from the sides or the back while sitting. I know coding so we can turn our heads while sitting would be a pain but a VERY minor track skill while sitting would work. It's not going to be abused because if I'm out pulling the last thing I want to do is sit down. which brings me to my next suggestion<P>Laying down to heal - granted coding to have us lay down would be a nightmare but just black the screen when we do it and it would give us slightly higher regen. Casters pre 35 get more mana when med then sitting the tradeoff is while medding they can't see should we kinda have the same with our hp (our all char's for that matter?)?<P>Weapons - Casters die, they sit and mem spells and are up and running, how do they mem spells? Their spellbook is soulbound. Our primary weapon should be soulbound, weather it be a rusty dagger or a Mithril Staff what ever weapon we have at death we should retain, It would even us out with casters when doing cr. They get their main weapon (spells) after death we should have ours.<P>I have plenty more that I've listed in previous posts I just came back to these to remind everyone that they were warriors pre 50 and that this isn't EverUber. Many of the changes needed go to well before post 50.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OK, I hear alot of Warriors saying that they don't want an AoE taunt because it might be dangerous in certain situations.  Maybe you aren't getting the concept here.<P>Most skills/spells can be dangerous in certain situations.  AoE spells require very specific circumstances in order to be useful.  More often than not, you can get killed using them.  AoE taunt would be somewhat the same, except you would WANT them to attack you (hence, TAUNT).  Get it.  If you don't want everything around you attacking you, you don't use the AoE taunt.<P>I also noticed that most of you seem to think that the only place a Warrior will ever fight is in an enclosed area (Dungeon, Castle, etc).  This may be true for most higher level players (I don't really see this effecting much of the higher level groups), but some of us still fight outside most of the time (especially when you can't find a Cleric or Chanter to go with you).<P>Some of you also seem to be under the impression that this is MUST be a zone-wide taunt (a little exaggeration here).  I'm talking immediate area.  You wouldn't want to use it in a hallway,  but in any reasonably-sized (i.e. the green room in BB) room, it shouldn't aggro anything outside the room.  In other words, if you have 2 MOBs attacking your Cleric, it would allow you to stand right next to him and taunt both at the same time instead of trying to get them one at a time.<P>Again, this is a Skill.  Every skill requires a little bit of practice to figure out it's usefullness.<P>I cannot comment much on the post 50s problems because I have never been there, but this is about the only improvement I can see making for the pre-50s game.  AoE taunt would make the game much more fun and allow us to do what we are intended to do even better.  I also don't see any balance issues with this type of skill, since it really only effects a group and not an individual Warrior. (why would a Warrior want to Aggro everything around him if he was trying *laugh* to solo?)<P>Anyway, those are my thoughts.  I don't believe that Warriors need any changes pre-50s and have alot of fun playing them most of the time (when I'm not being trained or trying unsuccesfully to get a group going in Guk).  I like the Aoe taunt idea (it wasn't mine), but ,no, it isn't absolutely necessary.  Just something to make the game a little more fun and different.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ABSOR PLEASE READ AT LEAST THIS ONE--------<P>----Rangers go away.. stop using warrior thread to whine more. You are balanced! You have high dmg output + SPELLS + TRACKING and thats why you dont get warriors defensive skills. YOU ARE NOT WARRIORS! DUH! whiny little turds... Verant hands you an INSANELY overpowered epic weapon to boot and many of you whine about that too.<P>----More on topic here... Warriors are very well built. There seem to be alot of people posting nonsense *immpossible to fullfil* or *just plain retarded make-me-like-every-other-class* ideas.<P>Frankly if I see another *give me what that class gets* post I'm gonna hurl. Because we arent that class.. we are warriors.<P>Few real problems with warriors that I agree should be addressed.<P>1) TAUNT yes this needs to be made more effective. I play a 60 warrior and still have a hell of a time pulling stuff of our cleric or enchanter.<P>2) SHIELDS yes warriors shields should be allowed to be worn on our backs. Why else would a warrior carry one? noone is gonna sacrifice secondary hand weapond for a shield.<P>3) WARRIOR EPIC let me say this is just plain retarded. We have the hardest epic to complete (excluding broken quest epics) and yet our weapons suck. Existing weapons outdamage our epics.<P>4) and this is the only point I will mention another class, for a reason.<P>Warriors are suppose to be good damage dealers, with the main attribute of being able to "tank" the big mobs for a while. I have a concern regarding this that many people wont realize just yet (I'm sure some do however)<P>MONKS are as good if not better tanks thanw arriors now. After many revamps to the monk class (many that were needed) Monks defensive skills and natural AC have been increased too much. on top of this their dmg output has been increased to insane levels.<P>Put a 60 warrior and a 60 monk in a dual. Standing still just hitting each other no running or what I like to call *the best inet connection wins*<P>The warrior should ahve considerably higher hitpoints and defensive skills, however you'll see the warriors "massive hitpoints" drop in 2 seconds to the overpowered monk with 500 stacking haste items. All while the monk has more than 50% hitpoints left when the warrior dies.<P>Slightly more dmg output shouldnt tear theu a tank with massive hitpoints like that. Also notice monks defensive skill allows them to take dmg much better than  a warrior.... that just shouldnt be happening.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>***  ABSOR - SKIP THIS POST, JUST A RESPONSE  ***<P>To whoever said it was an advantage for small races to have hide and sneak....  These skills are essentially worthless.  I use sneak to get better prices from vendors, but I have to be behind the NPC for it to work.  Sure, I can sneak up behind a mob, but there's no way I'm getting in front or to the side of it without it aggroing?  What is advantageous about that?  And hide is a joke which doesn't work the way one would expect it to.<P>I enjoy being a Halfling from a Roleplay perspective, but aside from the exp bonus and infravision, there's no combat related reason to be a Halfling.  I'm not KOS in alot of places, but just about any faction can be fixed.  Large races get the innate ability to slam and cannot be stunned from the front.  That makes sense, however, small races have no innate defensive abilities which would seem to be logical.<P>In a fight, I'm picturing myself running around the mob, between it's legs, ducking, jumping, all to piss of the mob even more.  He should have a hard time hitting me.  I see an Ogre standing in front of the mob dealing damage but getting hit alot while he says, "Ow, stop dat", in a big dumb voice.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  I gave up strength, and the ability to deal more damage, because I felt defense actually meant something.<P>I liked what Mongo said (I think it was Mongo) about race advantages / disadvantages.  I mentioned that in an earlier post, but he explained it better.  Thanks...Mongo like candy?<P>This is a class balancing discussion, but talking about balance within the class is certainly a part of that.<P>Kleg, 52 Halfling Warrior</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As a monk, I think warriors need to be nerfed to the moon. They should not be allowed to out damage me, yet, as I look through the arsenal of warrior weapons and their skill caps I become concerned. After the expansions, warriors had become allowed to get a raise in skill caps, these caps was previously what allowed monks (who had higher caps) to outdamage. Now that both monks and warriors can max thier caps and both can use similair weapons the damage differential is not what it should be(I know some idiot is gonna start crying about how monks get ton po's but please remember that that weapon is uber rare and very very very few monks will ever have it).  <P>I know this belongs in the monk thread, but I sincerely believe that if changes were made to warrior arsenal (not letting them use a one handed weapon thats better than 11/20 in ratio for example) this would go a long way in achieveing some sort of balance.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>what's up with all the double posts? wierd<P>44 warrior now, dwarf. Absor, hope you are holding up well. lots to read with all this, I can't even keep up =)<P>Stats - doubt you can change this now, but what could have been =)<P>it's been raised a few times. All warrior should not have the same hp's and ac.  WE SHOULD have more than 10% more than hybrids though. Guys like Ogres and trolls and barbs should have the most HP's of all warriors and lowest AC. You grant them say an additional 10 to 15% Hp's over the base human while lowering their AC an equivalent amount that would allow them to get hit just enough more to have both they and the human dying at the same time from equal mobs.<P>the opposite for smalls. notably less HPs except for Dwarfs who are freakishly strong for being so small, but much higher AC due to their diminutive size and much more agile frames allowing them to dodge and such much more easily. Again except the dwarf, who isn't quite as agile due to being so bulked up. Just a thought to create a variance in us =)<P>MAJOR ISSUES<P>TAUNT TAUNT TAUNT  -  btw, how does it really work?<P>and this isn't only a 50+ issue, though worst there.  When a Warrior is fighting in a group of all equal lvls, or is less than the others, he should have issues taunting, as all the same or higher levels are going to create as much or more taunt than he. But when a warrior is 2 or 3 levels above the others, they should have the trouble getting the mob off the warrior.  Thing is, it seems in EQ it's the opposite.  As a 42 or 43 warrior, I get into groups often where I am 5 to 8 levels under the others. I was in Frenzy with some 49 warriors and hybrids, and guess what? I could taunt off them sometimes.  Now that's absurd, unless Verant programmed in that a mob would attack the lowest level creature close to the top of the list.  Please look into this and let us know if that is how the mobs react or if there is some other logical reason a 42 warrior could possibly taunt off a 49 warrior half way thru a fight. I'm not talking in the first 3 rounds here, I'm talking half way or more thru a Frenzy Ghoul fight that last almost a minute.  I can't do near his damage, nor should my Taunt aggro more than his, but I can still more than once in such a fight get the mob on me. I don't get how that is unless the other guy never hits his taunt key.<P><BR>HITPOINT's  -  yes, we need much more, but here's how and why <P>I want to come back to this. Seems a lot of us feel the same.  More HP's. But lets understand why.  For starters, Any plate wearing class should get the same AC from the same piece. Use Humans for a base.  Put on a Enameled Black CP on every Human plate class, and have each one have 80 str and the same sta. All should get the same AC, no one, not even us, should get extra ac from that. The extra AC should come from variances in Str and Agi and STa etc.<P>now, some would say this makes the Hybrids as tankable as us? No. they keep their 10% or so worse defense. and we get by lvl 30 or 40, 50% more HP's.  So if a 40 Paly has a base of 1200 hp's, a similar base warrior at 40 would have 1800. Sound unfair? Not really. The warrior is going to get hit the most. by removing the AC bonus a warrior gets (i think we get one) you basically make the Paly/SK have the same AC. The only part of us that allows us to tank is our slightly enhanced Defense and our extra HP's, and of course our constant hunt for more GEAR =).  <P>And another reason this isn't overly unbalancing. Buffs. Have my 40 cleric buff both with Valor and Symbol of Pinzarn.  That's almost 400hp's.  Something like 390 I think, I don't recall exact numbers.  so the paly would jump to almost 1600, the warrior to only about 2200. No longer is the Warrior ahead by 50% We've actually lost 200 hp's advantage.  But hopefully you see my point. The paly/sk plate classes should get the AC they need to be tanks, while sacrificing the HP's and a little defensive skill for thier LOH/HT and spells etc (SK maybe 5% def skill Pal 10% since paly's get to heal themselves).  We should have a LOT more HPs than they, since we can't back out of any fight and heal ourselves.  We have to make the Paly back out or have another class heal us.  So we should have a LOT more HP's. <P><BR>TRAVEL ISSUES  -  only class that has no escape options what so ever, and can't even solo some greens<P> Bind, don't need it, (though a few more small locations, or maybe a couple more GF style zones would work. A zone that is a hub to a bunch of other zones so we can at least have a reasonable run back).  Pain in the arse yes, but once my wife's cleric hit 29, if I couldn't get an exp res, I would just get a revive, and most of us could just as easily do a search of all clerics in a given range to try and locate one that could revive ( i did that for exp res all the time, didnt always find one, but it can be done).  It's much quicker than running back, safer, and you'll get most of the lost exp back in the time you are back to fighting.  (oh, could res types get a lfg style tag for when they are open to get res requests?)<P>Some form of ESCAPE. Now this is needed. I don't want to hear from the other whiny classes on this. Every single class except us gets an escape route. If I get aggro'd alone, I could be in serious trouble. many a green mob can take out a fully equipped warrior, and that is senseless. I note a fellow poster who was 51 being killed in Sro helping out others by trying to solo the lvl 35 SG. The SG kicked his butt. That should not be possible. The SG should hit about as often as I would on a mob 8 lvls or so above me. He should have been hitting for mear max every hit. <P>We need something. Someone suggested a special run skill that eats stamina. As long as it's fast, and gives us a chance to get outside of aggro range, that would make sense.  Or maybe as others suggested, some form of Instill Doubt or such. One idea was a momentary paralasis/mem blur effect. I could see something like this. Maybe it could have the efectiveness of Atone. (Atone is like memblur, but you only have about 1 sec to get out of aggro range. I keep trying to use it with my wifes cleric, and what I have found is if you are fighting 2 mobs, one must get rooted, run the other a LONG way off, and atone the rooted one. But you have to split the area the instant the Atone goes off if you aren't the cleric) So a scare skill like that would be effective. We use this skill, it gives a 2 second stun and atone, if we haven't gotten out of aggro range by then, it's on us again.  If you went with this idea, I would say it has to be non-combat initiated, and does not have a huge recycle. we get aggro'd more than once a zone often. and would need to be able to use this maybe once a minute or two.  I doubt a skill like this would have any impact in a group situation, except for the 2 sec stun. But once a minute or two would mean only one shot per fight.  that's a single shield bash that hits.<P>SHIELDS and BASHING -  yes, you can Bash and DW at the same time =)<P> Shields go into back slots, forget capes on warriors, they just get in the way.  Same with everyone probably. most capes aren't that effective, but let at least all plate classes put a shield on thier back. I know clerics would love that, being able to sling a Charred Gaurdian shield into the back for AC and Wis while using whatever else in thier offhand. Same with Paly's when using 2hs or 2hp. <P>As for BASH being useless after DW for smalls. I thought so too till 8 levels ago.  I saw a post on a Warrior board about something called Ghetto Bashing for non-larges.   When DW'ing, I now hold a shield with my cursor, and drop it into my offhand everytime BASH comes up. I then drop the weap back in and continue to DW.  This take a lot of timing and work. I suggest to those who think 35 - 50 is boring, start practicing you're Bash skill like this, it's take a lot of work to do good.  But this doesn't help when Using 2h weapons. Kick should get stun at 30 or 35 not 55 for non-larges, as they don't use kick alot and that's all we do. Ogres, Trolls, Barbs, raise your hand if you have used Kick since you get slam?<P><BR>WEAPON SPECIALIZATION  --  see my post about this on the first page of thread 2. would be perfect for us around 40. And would also help immensely with out Taunt problem<P>BIND WOUND  -  help us here<P>some have mentioned fixing our cap pre 50, this is a must, who in the world is going to have more knowledge of field dressings than a warrior?  <P>Some alternate healing.  Meditate is a mana regen, but if I'm not mistaken, it is a health regen too. why doesn't every class get meditate, that way the couple of us without spells or heals can have a slightly increased heal beyond sitting?  that would affect whom? rogues, warriors, and somewhat sk's? sk's get lifetaps, but those are so small and only combat initiated. Everyone else either Meds or has heal. Just a thought.<P><BR>Absor, HOPE to see your thoughts on our posts soon, take care and good luck with all this<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Hey thanks for the opportunity to speak up on this subject. A few things that I feel would cement the warriors role in Everquest and still maintain some form of balance are.....<P>1) Movement of the Stun Kick at lvl 55 to a much lower level. Large races have the ability to stun with slam from lvl 1. I know that is a racial advantage but the large races all enjoy many advantages as is...better stats for warriors, troll regen, ogre stun immunity, barbarian's that have no real faction issues and can wear medium armor. Shield bashing is only used by the medium/small races until lvl 13 when we get dual weild. I'm level 60 and Ive used a shield maybe 10 times in the last year. The nautilus shield from plane of fear is like ripe fruit rotting on the vine...maybe make it wearable on the back?<BR>2) Piercing seems like it should cap at 250 like all our other melee weapon skills.<BR>3) An increase in our taunt capability..either through a skill increase or higher damage output. From my experience the damage I deal has more to do with my taunt effectiveness than actually pushing the taunt key. I dont want to out damage anyone or solo Nagafen...I want to take the hits my monk/rogue/wizard friends expect me to. Many many battles end with me showing no real drop in HPs while the rest of the party are "beat to hell".<BR>4) A more compelling progression of skills would be nice...from lvl 25 to 35, we have only one skill to work for, then from 35 to 51 we see no real new content for our class. I have wanted to see the "Headbutt" skill added to the warrior since day one. My idea would be...Headbutt- a 3rd attack skill not tied to the Kick/bash timer. Headbutt would either be a success or failure...Success would mean the warrior deals damage to the target and scores a stun. Damage could scale with skill. Failure, on the other hand, would damage the warrior AND stun him. This would be similar to the monk MEND skill...low skill would mean using it is a risk. At later levels it would be a minimal damage increase and still add some risk to the combat. This would be a class defining skill...all our melee skills are shared with the other classes now. Rogues and rangers score critical hits...rangers can kick....paladins/sks/even shaman can bash with a shield. I know our berserker frenzy is class specific but in reality it means a warrior is about to die or be completely healed. That doesnt define my class in a very positive way. <BR>5) A graphical representation of the disciplines would be great...maybe a spell gem type icon. I know we can make macro's but like with the druid I also play...I click the spell gems to cast.<BR>6) A way for warriors to remove self-buffs would be super. I have cobalt greaves and I cant click off the invis spell effect on myself...same with cobalt boots, vambraces, etc. How is this a balance issue? Well the druids can do it, darn it.<P>Over all I am well pleased with the warrior class and my role on events as well as in small groups.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I do agree that warriors are pretty well balanced, but complaints are that they're simply not that interesting.  My warrior is lvl 50, but I have a high level enchanter and I have to wait for warriors to taunt off of me a lot.  It still takes a while if the warrior considerably lower in level compared to the mob, but it still happens.  Taunt can be tweaked a little, but being a chanter (biggest taunt of all classes IMO) warriors do a good job at this.  Secondly, a unique skill to warriors would be nice.  Yeah, staple class, ordinary, whatever =)  They should get SOMETHING unique, not simply best at all these different areas (taunt, hp, ac, etc).  These traits are shared by many other classes, just in varying degrees.  Lots of ideas have been posted but one thing I think would be great for warriors is an AE Taunt.  There are lots of other good ideas.  AE Melee is cool too, maybe coupled with taunt thing.  The warrior takes out his giant two-hander, yells, "Frogloks suck!" and proceeds to spin his sword about him slicing each froglok in half =)  Lets face it, two handers are pointless at higher levels cause they simply don't taunt as much.  Perhaps making two handers have more taunt to them (at least for warriors) or enabling a skill used only with a two hander will make the master weaponry (warriors) actually use more of a variety of weapons.  Warrior's main job is to taunt/tank.  If they're not dual wieldig, that's not gonna happen.  Perhaps that could be changed.  Just think warriors simply need a little refreshing addition to the mundane and non-unique roll they play.  Thanks for listening, and stay tuned til next time.

</FONT><HR>I'm a warrior on Rathe.<BR> One thing I have alway wanted to know is why are warriors ,who SHOULD be the best at any melee invloving a weapon,not the best.I mean like monks are THE best at unarmed combat.Rogues are THE best at backstabbing etc.Well why do warriors hit less often,hit for less,have no REAL attacking skils except attack (and kick/bash) and why dont we have some Str bonus that no other class can attain to?<P> Warriors should hit far harder than any other armed class.Period.We should be the lean ,mean fighting machines that we are in other fantasy worlds.Str should be given a higher cap than other class's.Thus enabling us to hit harder.This wouldnt unbalance and game issues as it would then help us when trying to taunt.More damage = more taunt ability.<P> Warriors I think need a far higher rate of regen.At the moment its really sad to watch your groups wizzy regen as fast as you  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> .If the party are jumped during dowtime then casters may have some mana with which to do battle ,be it short lived.But warriors are unable to be effective with low hps after battle and thus become a hinderance.We jump up to defend casters,get whacked,remember cleric was oom and watch as your low supply of hps drop suddenly.Bang ,dead,and grp have to get ya back to camp spot etc and arrange rez and so on.In other words casters mana is their life blood,HPs are a warriors.Cant we have our HP regen in line ,or close,to that of a casters mana regen?<P> We also need better taunt ability but I think given the chance to do more damage than rangers,monks,rogues then we would have a better taunt ability.<P> I'm sorry to harp on about it but WHY do monks/rangers/rogues do more normal combat damage than us? It really is against all reason and normal rpg sense.<P> I am not talkin about being faster and having better equipment etc just plain old fashioned better prime stats.For example in AD&D a Human warrior can atain a str of 18 the same as a human cleric(priest) BUT then the next point is split into 99 .Only a warrior benefits from this.He is able to go up to 18(99) where as the cleric(priest) is stuck at 18. We could have it that while it is possible for other classes to go above 200 str they will not receive any bonus from this.I would even go as far to say 180.<BR> <BR> I would love to see more crits/crips .This could either be the way to give warriors more damage or just increase base min damage in crits.<P> What about a bezerker str disc that actualy works.Not a 15 second thing but a 10 min etc effect.This could be a skill so that the more points entered into skill,the longer it lasts.It could be a current spell effect or a new effect.Either way it would be a str buff.<P> We really need something active to do between 30-50. Apart from learning new weapon types there is nothing.Having said that even then some other classes get a higher cap than us for some weapon types.<BR> <BR> One last thing I would like to see is a skill that lets you specialise in a particular weapon type.This could be like a clerics spec where as the first one to a certain skill level is the one a warrior would be specialised in.Or make it a chosen skill like that of casters.This could be restricted ,once a weapon type is chosen the rest are greyed out etc.What this would give a warrior would have to be discussed but it could be higher crit,better double damage/attack %,make that type of weapon faster etc etc.Nothing to unbalance the game of course.There are lots of nice weapons out there and in 'reality' warriors would be a fickle bunch and have their own favourites.<P> <BR> I hope that warriors do get some enhancements as at the moment they are over shadowed in a grp damage wise etc when grped with some other melee types.It can get embaressing you know watching a monk with a stick beat the living daylights out of a mob while said Mob attacks ranger gets backstabbed by rogue and the sad warrior is hitting away  and praying his taunt works....or that no one notices that he is not the main tank anymore  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P><BR>Be safe and good forune to you all.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>doh! just remembered one of my weapon improvement ideas.<P>i think this should go for all classes but especially melee'ers.  <P>Why are all weapons just as effective against all mobs?  Wouldn't peircing or slashing a skeleton be almost useless?  should I be BASHING a skeleton with a Blunt weapon?  <P>Ok, so now you see where I'm going. No cracks about the D2 reference please.  But in D2 and I believe a lot of other fantasy style games, different weapons are more or less effective against different mobs.  Give each weapon type a reason to be used.  <P>Slash - no bonuses or minuses.<P>Blunt - say 50% more damagae against undead, normal against usual mobs, say 50% less against something like a giant or a dragon.  I would say that because Blunts don't cut unless it's a spiked club etc.  <P>Peirce - bascially useless against undead, extra good against a chain mail wearing enemy where the chains in the mail would actually help 'guide' the point of their dagger or rapier into the mob.  something along those lines.<P>The idea would be, take various weapons and make them more or less effecient against varios mobs, so we have to PICK our weapons per fight just like casters have to PICK their spells.  This would give a lot more depth to our decision making and what we carry around and in the bank.  <P>One example.  The Wurmslayer. well duh, a weapon with a name like that should do 50 to 100% extra dmg to a wurm. That's what it was designed to do, why else would it be called a wurmslayer =)<P>Hope you like this idea<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>all and all i think the warrior isn't to bad off.<BR>though i do have a few complaints that others have touched on.<P>1. taunt.. i don't know how to fix it so it is "balanced" but it needs to work better. A SK using a lvl 4 spell shouldn't be a better taunt then me at lvl 60.<P>2.  Hit Points.. I would like to see us with a bit more HP.. post 50 we should be getting a better jump on HP gain per lvl.  Pallies have been given "extra hp spell" (devine str) not to mention increase in LoH. the warriors should see a similar increase.<P><BR>3.  Piercing..  Warriors are master of all weapons.. i can't understand how or why our piercing cap is lower then 1hand slash/blunt<P>4.  Cobalt.. all i can do is laugh at this. Who ever decided how warrior could obtain cobalt must of really hated the warrior.  Every other class armor w/ the exception of a few pieces drops off a named mobs.  besides boots/gloves/bp being from a named.. this random drop stuff sucks.. drop rate on cobalt bracer and helm? yeah don't think it exists.. i lived in seb from 52 to 60.. yeah i had to buy my arms.. no zol ever droped them for me..  the only cobalt item that seems to drop w/ good frequency is the BP off trak.. but something needs to be done ESPEACILLY about helm/bracer.<P>5.  warrior FA..  i know there has been alot of ppl wanting different things from this.. but.. if you do NOTHING ELSE .. please up drop rate on queen blade and hand of maestro.. i don't think the quest is to hard.. i like it hard.. i like to have to kill hard mobs to obtain the best weapon i can use. but making maestro hand drop rate 1 in 6 ( right now 0/6 for hands)  is just dumb.. it doesn't make it harder.. making me kill maestro 10 times for one item makes no sense.. and come on, his hand.. i should be able to cut it off after i kill him haha.. next item for fa that needs some change.. queen in chardok.. i mean come on.. does prince always drop head? yeah.. king always drop note? yeah.. queen always drop blade?  hmm.. no.. don't see the rationale there.. not to mention she is the hardest out of the royals.. again why do i need to kill her 4 times just to get one blade... isn't the idea to show i am worthy enough to weild this blade?  by killing her one time should show that i am worthy enough.. once again having to deal w/ this random drop for these 2 items doesn't make me more worthy.. just makes it dumb.. please do something w/ those 2 drops if you don't do anything else in altering the weapon it self.. this is the bare minimum you should do .. <P>Horaf <BR>lvl 60 dorf of saryrn<BR>The War Council</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The main thing I have to agree with on these posts are the hp/ac problems.  But I have also like the ideas about the shields and the post earlier about weapon specialization.  It has been said to start at for instance lvl 40, but personally think it would be a good effect for warriors starting this at an earlier lvl.  as to what the specialization would actually do, I'm not sure, say either a built in haste or higher damge output or something, but that would also help us in tuanting off the mobs either way.  Just my 2 sence.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think equiping a sheild in the back slot at lvl 40 would be great. it would solve the long period of no skills between 35-50 and basically longer then that. it would solve the issue of hp/ac and if you could use it for bash also it would give the stunn effect. just a thought.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>on my weapon specialization idea.  I still prefer the Innate haste idea proposed in the post on the first page of the 2nd thread.<P>but after a post I just read, an alternative to haste would be a dmg boost. If I remember this correctly, modal &lt;sic&gt; (the number we hit for the most) dmg is 'wpn dmg*2 +1' and the cap comes off at 20. let that formula change some<P>lvl 30 = wpn dmg*2.5+1 maybe<BR>lvl 40 = wpn dmg*3+1<BR>lvl 50 = wpn dmg*3.5 +1<BR>lvl 60 = wpn dmg*4+1<P>or some other increasing amount. we are weapons masters, as such not only do we learn how to use all weapons (and truly, there should not be a non Monk only weapon out there we can't use, except for special single class specific ones).  As Masters, we should also get better and better at doing MORE damage with a weapon the longer we use it.<P>Another possibility, take the uncapped dmg after 20, take the +1 portion and have it scale up. At +1 per lvl, that would mean +40 to a lvl 60. <P>that would seem sensible.  (I still like the haste idea, but this has some nice possibilities too =)  An exe axe at 20, dmg 25, so 25*2+1 = 51 mod dmg. Same with a Wurmslayer before the dmg bonuses kick in.  But at 40, that same Exe axe or WS would have a Mod of +19 or =70.  At 60 it would =90.  Why would that be a bad thing? An actual reason to consider using an Exe axe again =) well, maybe not but still =)   <P>and i still think lvl limits should have been put on all weaps just like the procs have.  that was the downfall of Diablo, being able to give the best weapons and armor to a lvl 1.  D2 made you reach certain stat or lvl ranges to use better and better items.  would have been great here too.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>So far, I think the very best thing I've seen suggested is Weapon Specialization.<P>Give the Specialization at around level 30 or 40... then give it some kind of effect like... Crits with specialized weapon do an additional 1/2 of the Warrior's level (equal to the Warrior's level with Two Handed weapons).  Crips with specialized weapon do twice that.<P>Example...  Stumbles Underfoot (my warrior) becomes a specialist with 1h-slashing at level 40...  She gets a crit on a giant with a hammer for 60pts.  With a sword, the crit would be 80pts.  If she were a specialist with 2h-slashing, then the crit would be for 100pts (more really, because the base crit effect for a 2h weapon should be higher.)<BR>Or make it skill dependent, rather than level dependent.  Of course doing this means you have to scale the skill so that increases fairly evenly after getting it.<P>Also, tying in with another suggestion I saw... make it so a 2h specialist can automatically use a shield when using their specialty weapon.<P>This way, you've got reasons for each specialization... rather than ending up with the "cleric trap" where everyone will simply specialize in 1h-slash because of the Wurmslayer.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Repost from the other topic since Absor did not make an appearance in it.<BR>----------------------------------------------------<P>Some other issues I'd like to bring up or echo. Weight of some of the armor is just too much for smaller races. Not every warrior is a large race and it makes it difficult/frustrating.<P>Give small race tanks some reason to play those races. We have no advantages other than not needing a shrink potion (cobalt bracers are so rare that those arent even worth mentioning to shrink) on outdoor raids. No racial bonuses and for the most part inferior stats.. we miss out on a number of nice items too yet there are perhaps 3 or so items in the high end of EQ that are SMALL only (not this small/medium crap, SMALL only - dwarf, halfling gnome).<P>Raise our HP, big one.. with the nerf of the Donal's bp it will be even more important.<P>Biggest issue, taunt. Raise our cap to 252, maybe that will make it more effective? I dont know -- but DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. Raise our piercing cap too to 252 since a number of nice weapons are found there. We are weapon masters, not good at all weapons but simply above average at piercing!<P>Second largest issue, the rarity of the epic quest pieces. You made cazic skin/slime blood drop every time (one or the other) so do it to maestro hand. Fix the queen too. We killed her 3 times the other day for no blades.. 8 hours in chardok for no blades when multiple warriors only need that (or that and the hand, surprise surprise) hurts.<P>As for the monk who thinks warriors can outdamage you.. if that is the case, your gear is VERY poor.  At high levels warriors will do (if lucky) 70% the dmg monks do and usually only about 50%.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The "taunt problem" most of us are talking about is the post-50 taunt problem.  Post-50, blue con mobs are now tauntable (after a recent patch) but at a lesser rate than pre-50 mobs.  <P>The difference is immediately noticable<BR>if you fight in an area with both high-40's and low-50's mobs, such as the hand room in Karnor's.  The hands go up to about 47, and the constructs are a little higher, but when you get a summoning construct (meaning level 51 or higher) it is much more difficult to taunt.  Karnor's doesn't have very many level 51+ mobs, fortunately, but Sebilis does, and so do the new high level dungeons in Velious.<P>If you spend any time in Sebilis you'll run into krup knights.  They are just a normal warrior frog, but they range from 49 to 52.  Assuming a normal level distribution, 50% should be level 51 or 52 and therefore much harder to taunt.  If you are grouped with someone who can even slightly outdamage you (i.e. every similarly-equipped or higher level monks or rogues, and well-equipped higher level rangers) you'll spend most of the fight NOT tanking, which is frustrating.  Additionally, formerly-routine maneuvers such as taunting off of a shaman after a Togors, enchanter after a mez, or cleric after a heal, become more difficult and therefore more frustrating, not to mention the extra healing the cleric needs to do, lessening the overall efficiency of the group simply because taunting post-50 mobs is HARD.<P>Compounding the issue of just plain getting the Taunt key to work is the WAY it works.  It only places you at the top of the list, but it sure as hell doesn't KEEP you there, and if someone is out-taunting you through damage or speed or a combination, they'll immediately re-take the top spot while you fruitlessly bang on the taunt button until it recycles.  Certain class/weapon combos are extraordinarily difficult to taunt off of, such as a monk wielding a runed fighters staff.<P>It's a a vicious cycle that forces all warriors into the same path, which should be sufficient to tell the developers there is a problem.<P>In the interest of, well, FUN, it should be possible for warriors (and all melees) to use the weapon type of their choice, and provided their actual weapon is good enough, they should be able to do their job.  We shouldn't be required to dual wield the fastest weapons known to man in order to tank.  Players should be able to taunt well enough to tank even when using a high quality twohander.  Since we can't, there's clearly a problem with the way the hate list works and the way the taunt skill interacts with it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ah huv been thinkin' of ways tae improve tha tauntin' abilities fur awhile now.  Ah'm glad tae see Ah'm not tha only one that has thought of an AoE taunt.  Ah've also come up with several other ideas in this area.<P>AoE Taunt - Seperate skill from tha normal taunt.  This "taunt" would huv at LEAST tha same area of effect as tha warriors melee range (if not greater).  i.e. if Ah kin smack it from where Ah'm standin' then it will be in tha AoE of tha new taunt skill.<P><BR>Rescue Discipline - Basically this discipline would huv a duration.  Durin' it's duration tha Taunt Skill (including AoE Taunt skill if it is implemented) would get an added bonus.  Some ideas on these bonuses are:<P>   MEGA Taunt on tha target(s)<BR>   Reduced refresh time of the skill(s)<BR>   Wipe of the mob(s) current hate list<BR>   Combination of the above<P><BR>Taunt Refresh - Reduce tha refresh time fur a target that is invalid or too far away.  Ma opinion is that tha refresh time fur those instances should be automatic.  Similar to usin' range weapons on targets that are too far away.<P><BR>Taunt Message - Please add a message for everyone tae see that Ah'm usin' ma skill.  It use tae drive me crazy hearin' people in tha group yellin' "Taunt! Taunt! Taunt!" when Ah'm tauntin' like a mad man.<P>Ah've since made a hot key that uses tha /doability command tae issue tha taunt an' then created an /emote taunts %T mercilessly! tae let EVERYONE know that Ah'm tauntin'.  Ah've also had to put in a pause to match tha refresh time er else people may git tha message when there really wasn't a taunt.<P>The PROBLEM with tha hot key solution is that I can NOT use any other hot keys until my custom Taunt recycles (which is 5 seconds).  Five seconds can sometimes seem like an eternity.<P>Ah've had many people tell me that they like ma emote an' huv wondered why Verant never made message fur in tha first place.<P><BR>2 Hand Damage - 2 handed weapons still need to huv thier damage output increased.  Thay simply do NOT match tha damage ootput of dual-wieldin'.<P><BR>Improve Summon Corpse - Because of melee classes inability tae bind close tae dungeons, thay are ineffective for CRs.  Even when casters with tha summpon corpse spell are present, it's most times a huge hurdle tae git melee classes back to tha dungeon in order for thier corpse tae be summoned.<P><BR>Lincus<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok... here's a summary of thoughts on the warrior.<P>1) We do plenty of damage and have a great selection of items. Cosmetically at 50th level I'd like our critical and crippling hits to do a minimum damage and even have a very small percentage chance to do way more damage. I really don't think this would do much in the way of increase our damage output but would be fun.<P>2) 2h weapons need to be looked at, and not just for the warrior. Lets make them a bit more usable. Currently, even the best 2h weapons can't outdamage standard post-50 1h weapons.<P>3) Do something with shields. Not sure what, but make them so that a warrior would actually use one on a regular basis. My idea is for a continous discipline at level 50 that halves our damage output, increases our taunt factor, but makes greater and superior heals far more effective on us. Perhaps you need a shield to do this? It would make it so that groups may not need a cleric in order to go anywhere, although they would not be as effective and the risks due to dying would be far more dramatic.<P>4) Taunting. I don't think we have too much a problem between 45-55. Below 45 the discrepency in weapons between players can make an average equipped warrior unable to taunt. I can't comment on high level warriors, but I hear they can have problems with the new epic quest items people have.<P>5) Epic Quest item - well, I'm sure you've heard enough about this. I'll add my two cents that it's perhaps one of the toughest weapons to get and really isn't that wonderful (although it is a nice weapon). Maybe ease down a bit on the drop rates of epic components.<P>6) I'd like some sort of mid-high level range warrior only armor that drops that can replace crafted but isn't as good as Indi or Cobalt. Cobalt bracers and helm are nuts to get too.<P>7) Cooler weapons that maybe aren't as damaging as Jade Mace, Jarsath trident or the standard post 50 weapons. Make it so the warrior can do a bit more damage with these proccing weapons if they are fighting the correct opponent (sword of skyfire is a good example of great weapon design IMHO - not the best in many situations, but fantastic in others).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Taunt: I haven't pushed a warrior past 50 myself, but if we can get a stronger taunt hey great.  If I don't want something on me I just won't taunt for a bit.  <P>Bind wounds: I'd like to add my voice to those asking for an increase in the skill cap.  Either that or allow warriors (hell maybe even everyone) to bind to 75% or so instead of 50%<P>AC:  Having a higher AC would be great as well of course.  What you all (Verant) may want to do is just wait until you have everyone else balanced out then make sure our AC is balanced with the other tank type classes.  Make sure to keep self buffs in mind when doing this balancing though.  <P>Just for the record my Warrior is currently only 35 so I think I may just be running into some of the problems discussed here.  <P>As it stands now I can solo certain select mobs that people my level hunt and still have over 50% health left.  <P>I know after hanging out with one of my friends last night who plays a paladin that I can taunt off him pretty much at will (he was using a Ghoulbane and I was playing with my Mith 2h last night.)  <P>As far as AC I have around 10 less than he does when he has his buffs up. We're both in armor appropriate for our levels.  I mainly have Crafted with some other pieces thrown in for flavor, he has a mishmash of various pieces of decent armor with nothing that would be considered "twinked."  No paladin quests armor though if I remember right.  Last thing I remember him saying about it was, "It sucks and it's a major pain to get and just not worth it." (Yes consider this a bone thrown to the paladins.) <P>Concerning hps when we both have his buffs up (on even footing) he has a little over 100 less hps than I do.<P>With these (very) rough figures also keep in mind that my warrior is a troll and his paladin is a half elf.  I don't know if maybe I should be doing a bit better in the hp department considering this, but hey I'm still doing okay.<P>All in all I like my green skinned tank more than any other class I've played.  He's just fun.  <P>Oh final thing.  Toward the beginning in Part Two of this thread (sheesh) I saw someone mention that all warriors should get access to Slam instead of Bash.  Might I say FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT'S GOOD AND PURE NO!  <P>Large races have various prices to pay for their benefits.  the horrendous weight.  For example having trouble getting though many areas, ever try the hedge maze in Unrest as a young Troll or Ogre?  We tend to get trapped in trains easier, we can't move around the mobs due to our size.  I could continue the list of penalties we pay in exchange for our benefits, but I'm sure we all already know them all by heart.  Please don't give away our Slam.  <P>(Note: I do have to say even at 35 thank God for regen...saved me in a fight just recently where I did the old pass out, stand up, pass out, repeat...I won that one.  It's not all about getting stuck in doors and taking damage jumping down a slight grade as a troll, we have our benefits too.)<P>Completely from a logical standpoint larger races get slam simply because their fists are HUGE.  A troll's hands are about as big as it's head.  Heck...one finger on a troll is about as big as a Half-elf's entire hand.<P>Anyway that's all from me...over and out.<P>And Absor...if you've read this far man I'm impressed and pleased that you've read my post.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First, a few of my observations about warriors (you need to know this so that you can correct me where I'm wrong).  As the 'base' class that other combat classes are built around, it should be very hard to find anything that is in need of change for the warrior.  I'm reading things like more hit points no.  If we change warrior hit points, then we have to change all the other classes hit points, since the basis for hit points, at least on tanks, is the warrior<P>I really don't expect to find too many things that need to be changed about warriors.<P>Also, I actually hope to see as many suggestions for 'nerfs' as for improvements.  Keep in mind that the warrior is pretty much the base class, so it is very unlikely that we will be improving something that has any major effect unless it addresses some deficiency.  If not, then this might actually be one of those cases where we need to do a sort of give and take.  I guess I'm saying that by their very nature, warriors just about have to be balanced, and an improvement to them might necessarily require a change to all other fighting classes to match them.  And that's not really what I'm looking for.<P>And, well, just like every other class, I want to warn you that a close examination like this brings the possibility that we will see something that needs to be nerfed.  For example, I really don't like the idea that warriors have so many spells available to them through items, especially things like invisibility.  I intend to ask that these things be looked at.  My suspicion is that they won't be removed, we don't like to do that.  But as a matter of class balance, I think it should be looked at.<P>My most powerful D&D character, by far, is a warrior.  He's not powerful because he fights really well, though that's part of it.  He's powerful because he has a lot of items that allow him to act like a caster.  He isn't that high level, but he is more wanted in groups than my higher level characters.  He's obnoxious, too, so it's not because of his personality<P>Anyway, don't be too surprised if I don't pick a lot of suggestions from your lists.  There might not be too much that needs changing.<P>Filo wrote:<P>&gt;"Another nice addition would be the addition of an "AE Taunt." In multi-MOB situations it would be nice if the warrior had a skill that would attract the attentions of more than one mob in the vicinity. Of course, this skill would have it's own drawbacks . . . be careful what you wish for."&lt;<P>Ok, that's not such a bad idea.  It has it's own drawbacks built right in.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  I'm even willing to suggest a version of this that might allow the warrior to attack all creatures in the area (one swing).  But it would have to be very high level and very limited in re-use.<P>&gt;"Another area where Warriors seem to be a little lacking is in the AC and HP department. I am not suggesting that a huge move is needed in either of these areas, but in the high level game, there is precious little difference between a warriors AC and HP versus the hybrids and melee "wizards" (Rogues and Monks) "&lt;<P>That's exactly the opposite of what the hybrids, monks and rogues say  A lot of them think that there is too wide of a gap between their hit points and/or armor class and that of a warrior, and they want more.<P>&gt;"This is further compounded by the relative difficulty of the warrior epic as compared to the others. Why the double whammy?"&lt;<P>I don't know  I really don't think that the warrior epic is relatively harder than most.  It seems to be pretty middle of the road, to me.  But I'll add it to the list (along with the request that we give it haste).<P>Aanya said:<P>&gt;"Other classes getting to close to warriors <BR>I believe that warriors should be able to tank better than Paladins and Shadow Knights. I see that you "noted" those classes wishes for higher hp, better defensive skills, higher offansive skills etc etc. What they asked for, was for you to make their tanking ability close to the warriors. Our tanking ability vs most normal mobs is fine (except for taunt), but if you increase the tanking ability of the SK and Paladin, keep in mind that there would be no real reason to play a warrior at all. Why play a warrior without spells when you can play a warrior with spells."&lt;<P>We will keep that in mind.  Remember, the warrior is the basis from which their skills and such are balanced.<P>evilsofa said:<P>&gt;"I've been watching the SK talk, and part of the problem there is that an improvement of the SK's defense (and, I'm sure, the Paladin's, when their talk begins) would be an intrusion on the Warrior's role as the ultimate defense. One way to give the SK and Paladin some wiggle room to improve their defense would be to improve the Warrior's defense in tandem."&lt;<P>Actually, even if knights had exactly the same armor class and defensive skills as a warrior, they would be worse tanks, since they have noticeably fewer hit points.  As I said earlier, improving warriors would almost by default mean an improvement in those other classes, so that the gap would not close.  If we choose to close the gap, then warriors will have to remain where they are.  I'm certainly not going to advocate an increase in warrior power _just_ so we can give more power to the hybrids.  That seems sorta backward to me.<P>ErikTorvald wrote:<P>&gt;"BIND WOUNDS.... <BR>Please allow the percentage healed to increase with level. Start at 50 and by 20 let the tank be at 70% then at 30, 80% then 40 at 90% then at 50 at 100%. Do you really think it will effect balance? Heck no.. I will still be screaming for a clearic. The bind wound is nothing more for the times when you have no cleric, druid, shaman, or necro handy."&lt;<P>Well, I'm not one to advocate something that is specifically intended to improve the solo ability of any class.  But I'll add it.<P>JazyaVechette wrote:<P>&gt;"2. (More of a general thing) 2h weapons not only do less damage overall, but taunt is laughable. <BR>Solution: Warrior hits from 2h Weapons generate 3x the 'taunt' factor of similar 1h damage."&lt;<P>Interesting idea.<P>Banzai wrote:<P>&gt;"*********************<BR>FURIOUS (Level 56):<BR>When using this discipline, the warrior will automatically riposte every attack landed on him by the opponent he is facing. This discipline lasts for 9 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 60 minutes.<BR>*********************<BR>This one is ok. My only real issue is that compare to:<BR>*********************<BR>FORTITUDE (Level 59):<BR>When using this discipline, the warrior cannot be hit in melee combat. This discipline lasts for 8 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 60 minutes.<BR>********************* <BR>Those 2 make no sense in that order. At lvl 59 Im basically invincible for 9 seconds AND I can repost but at lvl 59 Im only invincible for 8 seconds and have to wait LONGER? Ummmm, what? Im surprised no one has brought this up as lvl 59 is surprisingly lame. Especially since if you are running for zone and hit this you most likely will be summoned anyway so really, why bother? My take would be to refresh each at 15 min and swap them in lvl order or get rid of the lvl 59 one and give us something else."&lt;<P>That does seem odd.  So, Riposte prevents the attack from hitting AND does a return attack  Ok, this is on the list.<P>&gt;"This is FALSE of broken. The description read like you hit for 30, 35, 40, 46, 70, 80, 89, 95, 100, 200, 300! But that is not the case. "&lt;<P>Hehe, no, I don't read it as meaning that your damage will increase progressively.  It isn't broken.  The description could be reworded, perhaps, but it's not broken.<P>DurgoECI wrote:<P>&gt;"2) Cobalt Helm and Bracer -- Again, ditto what everyone else has said about the drop rates."&lt;<P>I'm not really looking for this kind of thing, but I'll add it to the list.<P>Thrakki wrote:<P>&gt;"What I propose, aside from the usual epic, cobalt drop increase, taunt increase, hp, ac, yada yada suggestions is an upgrade to how critical hits work. Currently critical hits still can and do less than your normal maximum hit. I know this complaint has been seen before, but why not fix it now? C'mon, it's a CRITICAL hit...it should do no less than at least 1 point higher than your normal max damage hit. "&lt;<P>I'm not sure that I agree with your logic.  I see a critical as a chance to do a lot of damage, not a certainty of doing max damage.  But I'll add it to the list.<P>gregory2000 wrote:<P>&gt;"I love the warrior class. The only thing i would like to see is the piercing cap to be raised from 240 to 250."&lt;<P>I'll add this to the list too.  But I disagree that warriors have some innate right to have the highest skill with all weapon types.<P>a_burly_gnoll00 wrote:<P>&gt;"1. The level 60 warrior discipline (aggressive) is bugged. It is supposed to increase your damage output by about 30-35% and also increase the damage mobs do to you by about 15%, and last for 3 minutes. Based on quite a bit of my own testing, it does not add ANYTHING to the warrior's damage output, but mobs do hit the warrior a lot harder (It appears to me that the damage the warrior takes may be increased by a lot more than you guys intended). Basically, we get the bad part but not the good."&lt;<P>I can certainly ask someone to look into it.  But I'm always a bit surprised when someone says:  "It's supposed to do"  I can't figure out how you know what it is supposed to do<P>Valshea1 wrote:<P>&gt;"2) Disarm.

Alan you just posted this yesterday and there are 248 response. So you thought we would not have much to say eh? hehe jk."&lt;<P>Well, having a lot to say is one thing, having new ideas is another  I respect the fact that you all have a strong desire to see changes made in favor of your class.  But I've got a few dozen pages of threads to read today, most of the posts in them say what every other post says.  My head hurts<P>But at least it's pretty clear what warriors want.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>&gt;"2. I know some folks have already voiced this here but put berserker frenzy on a timer. (maybe equal to a pally's loh or an SKs harm touch) And make it a bit more effective so that crits and crips go off a bit more."&lt;<P>Like this.  I gather that the idea is to have 'berserk' as a skill (or discipline) like taunt.  It would have to have a long timer, perhaps on the same scale as Lay on Hands.  I'll add it to the list and see if it floats (or something like that).  If it seems too powerful, perhaps we can replace one of the high level disciplines with this one.<P>Trana said:<P>&gt;"So please add some Iksar (race only) armor to a plane so we have alittle better chance of getting somthing."&lt;<P>I'll add it to the list.<P>Mongo Baroogar scribbled:<P>&gt;"As has been mentioned (Remf covered it specifically in terms of the greenie horde, and others mentioned related ideas), I would propose an inherent 'respect' effect. Green mobs (with perhaps specific exceptions due to location, etc) would not automatically agro on the passing warrior. I haven't thought this one all the way through, but I really cannot see anything truly unbalancing about this. There are probably other options for this as well (quests for items that would help, etc)."&lt;<P>I am really leary of this idea.  Very unwilling to add it to the list.  But I will.  It only seems fair, since I also want to see invisibility removed from warrior armor<P>Terq terrified me by saying:<P>&gt;"Repost"&lt;<P>Please, please, PLEASE don't repost things.  If you start doing that, I'll have to stop reading altogether.  These things are more than long enough already, with suggestions repeated over and over again.  But if you guys are going to start reposting things  I'll tear out what's left of my hair and do something crazy like having all warrior hit points cut in half.<P>I mean, not only did you repost something I'd already read, but it was a HUGE something that I'd already read<P>Anaxagoras drove me mad with this:<P>&gt;"For reference: <BR>By Huktonfonix:"&lt;<P>Aaaaaargggh!

</FONT><HR>I don't want to post any paladin issues on this thread but instead look at the tank side of things. There have been alot of nice suggestions.<P>Taunt - agree. of the three main tanks, and I mean taking damage ie PAL/SK, warriors need an upgrade in taunting to match PAL/SKs.<P>AC increase - not sure, Absor stated that balance is not done through equipment availibility. But a drops on cobolt should be made easier. An increase to base AC would be over powering for people who already have cobolt.<P>Stun - Not sure on this either. This is mostly the pally area if play until post 55 that is hehe.<P>As for some of the posts complaining about what hybrids have - wow! I have seen a lot of pal/sks wishing for what warriors have but this is the first time I have seen warriors wanting more of what hybrids have. Maybe in the levels below 50, hybrids spells seem cool, but there nothing special after 50. I think I saw one guy post that in choosing a warrior he gave up the right to cast spells - I beg to differ. Warriors are a parent/primary class. Hybrids gave up the ability to tank or melee as good as there parent class- not the other way around.<P> I plan to start a warrior soon and look forward to the enhancements to that class. I just hope they are made to the lower level game also. I can't speak for monks or rogues, but my image of a warrior is easy to play, well rounded, character that can take damage and deal it, but not be the best at it. After all, wizards and such are should be the most damage dealing class. As for warriors being knights, I don't think that image fits right - Paladins are knights : Shadow Knights are well... knights.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi Here is my suggestion Alan for warriors. <P>Nothing at all.<P>Warriors are balanced to be honest. <P>Balanced in the fact there is ALOUT OF SWEET equipment that makes your modern warrior look like junk. The problem is ... which is something varent leaves to the players is obtaining those items. And well thats not a warrior issue as far as mobs go. Its all players issue. Items in general take too long to get and the quests are too hard. But that isnt the case if your in a big guild. If your in a big guild you can have lots of fun and get lots of cool items and your classes as you will see are balanced.
