</FONT><HR>What about the possibility of adding a specialization for bards at lvl 30? They would be able to specialize in one of the types of music, percussion, wind, etc, and this would improve their effectiveness.  I.E. give them the bonuses that an instrument in that area would have but not have to have the instrument equipped?<P>Just a thought<P>Menemas Songweaver<BR>Vazaelle</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think specialization would be great if there were a) some sort of rhyme or reason to the assignment of instruments to song types, b) assurances that instruments won't be randomly swapped again, and c) a fix to songs that can use, but are not currently enhanced by instruments. As it stands, specialization would probably be "balanced" by reducing all non-specialized instrument use, and be relatively worthless to boot.<P>While a nice idea, I'd personally rather see song ranges and durations increase, along with lower song-resistance across the board.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This post is mostly to bump the subject back to the first board.  <BR>A quick question for Absor though.<BR>you seem to agree that bards really loose the ability to contribute to raids post 50.  Yet you don't expect the hastes to get a change in the way they stack.  You don't like upping offense, and only minimal changes are likely to defence.  What do you see our role in raids as, our balanced contribution would be what if there is no change to the haste stacking?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The only thing I see that is unbalanced with bards is the inability for our stongs to stack with other spells.  As the ultimate grouper(SP), our songs should add to what the other casters do, not replace or hinder.  That is the problem I seem to have in getting a group and keeping a group.  They get frustrated with my songs not allowing them to buff the lure or me.<P>My two CP.<BR>Rob Hall</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Some comments on previous posts from fellow players:<P>1. Rogue type skills: I agree that those skills could be removed and left to the Rogues, they are pretty<BR>useless for someone who plays a Bard, and useless in general in the game anyway.<P>2. Feign death: I think it'd be simpler to leave it to Monks, since Bards apparently received a Instill<BR>Doubt skill, which I havent been able to test yet. That Instill Doubt should work well, and shouldn't<BR>'fear' but make the target confused and so there shouldnt be any trains, and no need to zone, but of<BR>course it should work only on one target, on blues or lower, and only every xxx minutes like the<BR>forage skill. That could save the Bard's life many times when soloing, and help a group that becomes<BR>outnumbered by blues by removing at least one. If the Instill Doubt acts like fear (I'm pretty sure<BR>it does, havent tested), then it creates trains and I'd rather not use it than have to waste another<BR>10 mins to zone and zone back.<P>3. Increase forage cap: I suppose yes? It takes forever to get it up, even longer than the Sense Heading,<BR>and is so boring that I prefer to buy food/water.<P>4. Parry and riposte: definitely, in my mind the Bard should be agile like the monk, a real 'grasshopper',<BR>and should NOT wear plate armor but rather have 'dancing' skills that can be triggered every once in a<BR>while during fight and give temporary agility or defense of any sort. That should trigger something like<BR>the male half elf dancing animation. Think 'drunken style kung fu' : that idea posted earlier aboiut alcohol<BR>being useful to Bards was a good one and fits the Bard well, for every bottle of alcohol, can trigger<BR>the 'dancing skill' , or just increase a bard's dancing skill for some time ? I like the idea of a Bard<BR>being fun and if Bards get a reputation of being 'drunken Bards' that's for the better even more fun!<BR>Of course it means we'll need a good cap to alcohol resistance cauze we dont want to fight with the screen<BR>view completely distorted ! And I'd rather have fun increasing my alcohol tolerance skill than the forage/<BR>hide(boring)/sneak(even more boring)/safe fall(extremely boring)/sense traps(unimaginably boring)<P>5. Song effect time: the song timings are good and twisting is fun, only small easy improvement is to<BR>allow to automatically stop current song while starting another so we press once for each song and not twice.<BR>Thus pressing the same song twice stops it for good without starting another. Pressing another song while<BR>one plays stacks the second one. Hence twisting cycle takes 3 buttons presses instead of 6. I.e.<BR>start/start/start instead of start/stop - start/stop - start/stop. VERY EASY to implement and certainly<BR>appreciated. And doesnt remove my fun of twisting songs.<P>6. Specialization: I agree on previous posts it's not very original to say the least but it makes a lot<BR>of sense to specialize in some instruments.. though to be fair.. a Bard should be good at ALL instruments<BR>that's the purpose of the Bard so it's not that good of an idea. Also the way songs are grouped per<BR>instrument means you'll be good at either dots/ or speeds/ or heals and nothing else so it's a bad idea.<BR>Plus after specializing you'll get increased effect of all songs within range which means considering what<BR>increased effect can have in game for every Bard song, just forget it ! EQ designers will never do it<BR>or do it badly. It's one of those ideas that every one thinks is good but in effect will not work.<P>7. Charming/mezzing: ok, seeing the concurrence with enchanters, I think to make Instill Doubt really good<BR>as suggested in point 2 will give a unique ability to Bard : to get rid of just one blue without creating<BR>a train so useful to groups in dungeons even high levels. Of course that must work like 50% of time at<BR>max skill cap and on lower level monsters (lower level of mob to Bard's = better chance of success). This<BR>is unique to the enchanter in that it relieves the party outnumbered from unexpected 'adds', when party is<BR>in bad condition and that could save someone's life. It wouldnt work again then for another 5-10 minutes or<BR>so, preventing soloing Bards to use it to avoid death vs strong blues and levelling quicker. i.e. the time<BR>it takes to be available again would be greater than time to pull and kill one blue in solo making it not<BR>so attractive to use to 'cheat' in soloing strong blues. It has to be said though that for a good party<BR>even in a bad condition, one extra blue will probably rarely be such a problem that the Bard having this<BR>skill will be valuable to the group for that skill... I leave it to other posters to comment on that ?<P>8. If a new song increases party damage it should affect the Bard as well !<P>9. All those ideas of songs that help other casters not being interrupted, or any other class to be more<BR>succesfull _AT THE EXPENSE_ of the Bard player's fun are just VERY BAD IDEAS! We've got enough with that<BR>terrible mana song. Any new buff type songs that help the party should help the Bard get into melee or<BR>into mezzing or into healing and have some responsibility, not everyone EXCEPT himself !<P>10. New graphics: I totally agree the Bard should look more fun and have colourful jester type armors<BR>that are lightweight and not as good as plate (which the Bard shouldnt wear at all), and have some nice<BR>effects on it. To me the best effect is just to increase a Bard's 'harmony' i.e. do like those magic<BR>instruments increase singing/string/drums/whatever, hence not doubleing up with any other class 's effects.<P>11. I am sick to death of seeing all the Bards in that ugly dark blue lambent armor! A bit of variety<BR>please ! And why is it that I see SO MANY twinked Bards in full lambent ? Other classes's armors are full<BR>of details in the texture, the lambent armor is so dark blue basically you could just draw it untextured<BR>it wouldnt make any difference.<P>12. Using instruments as weapons: yes.... but no. It is one of those few things left to a Bard to decide<BR>for himself, and shine in strategy whether it's best to use weapons or instruments in each and every<BR>situation. Some combos as epic weapons, sure, but not to be generalized. Now to be fair.. we don't really<BR>have much choice anyway since meleeing becomes pretty useless after level 25 or so with our ridiculously<BR>weak melee ability.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>1 small point: The big problem is that bards seem to be designed to enhance parties over being individually useful. However, the conflicts with spells turn grouping into an exercise in frustration as you try to determine which two or three songs won't overwrite a better spell, or keep a spell from casting effectively, or even have ANY decent effect on the proceedings.<P>If necessary, make the stacking component less than the unstacked version... so that a 10% haste song would add 5% or even 3% to a haste-buffed character. Enough to make it worthwhile and the bard an obvious asset, rather than a distant choice for filling party positions.<P>Hastes are not the only songs where this is an issue, however. Chains seems to overwrite snare, letting a creature free after as few as a second or two, even if it has been snared previously (in this case, being used by a bard who wants to use the slow component in a non-AE song). The psalm of warmth seems to add to heat-based damage shields, but conflicts with thorns for no obvious reason. Heck, there's no good reason why a person with Spirit of the Wolf cast upon them should run as fast as the group if Selo's Accelerando is being played.<P>Besides Selo's I can't think of a single effect we do that is nearly as powerful as the caster version of that effect, so either we stack them, or become the partial-party class... since we can perform adequate (not great, just adequate) fill-in for a misformed party.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Because bard songs use no mana (well, the majority of them in any case), they have been deemed to be extremely powerful, and as such the spells themselves have been greatly nerfed from their similar counterparts that casters have.<P>This is bad, because it makes the songs worthless pretty much.  The songs should have the same effectiveness as the equivalent caster ones.  But how do you offset the fact they use no mana?<P>Simple.  You MAKE them use mana.  Most songs that bards have a problem with are the one time effect songs, like mez and stun.  It seems to me it would be pretty simple to start using mana for those songs.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>By the way... some bards seem to confuse the fact that we, as players, have risen to the challenge presented by a class with eccentric, yet mostly inferior abilities with being a well-formed class mechanically. It is fine to be proud of what you, and in fact, most of us have accomplished, that doesn't mean that there are not issues to be dealt with, and that we should not be adjusted to serve a more useful role in the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One, don't make songs use mana like someone suggested.  They should be powerful as the spells, because their weakness is in their super short duration.<P>Also, please look at the disarm/sense traps ability before it becomes as apparant as a defficiency as pick locks has with kunark.  I noticed in charasis that my rogue friend with 140 or so sense traps could pick up a rug pit trap from across the hallway, but me at my maxed 75 skill couldn't sense it when I was standing right on the edge of falling into it.<P>Also, since hide/sneak are so low, I think we should get the confirmation on success/fail like rogues have.  With that low of skill, it fails 75-80% of the time anyways, so it is not like we could use the skill to save us from a train for sure, and it also does not hide us from undead like the rogue's skill does.<P>Dolphin Oceansinger<BR>58th Bard on Prexus<BR>Leader of Domus Divinae</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OK I have to make this point, and hopefully it will be read!<P>You say that because our songs are manaless, that they become inherently powerful.  But though we have no mana restrction on our songs (which isnt really true but i will go into that later), we have a time restriction.<P>I can only twist 3 songs at a time.  Unlike most casters, I can only give my party at maximum 3 buffs.  If i choose to buff I can not snare, and vice versa.  If I choose to do damage I can not buff.  As it is, bards have the weakest spells, and the largest time constraint.  If a shaman wants to Buff, slow, DoT, and heal he can.  He can do all of these things and at some point during fights and down time say Full Mana.  At best I can do three things.  That right there balances our class, and SHOULD take away Verents need to nerf our oh so poweful songs...which arent.<P>As far as the mana issue goes, I experienced the perfect example.  Last night I was killed in Kael.  Because I am higher lvl then the enchanter there I was in charge of charm Crowd control.  However, due to my rez, I was OOM.  Because it takes me almost 15 min to gain back a bar of mana, I was unable to keep our foe charmed.  My party was wiped out because Bards are seen as a manaless class.  Well, if we are manaless then make our songs just that, manaless.  If we are not then at least give us some way to regain a resource we need to do our job.  I cant even get mana back as fast as a lvl 4 caster...and I am lvl 54.<P>Finally, please raise the cap on charming/mezing of mobs.  If you can make certain mob's unmezable then I dont see the problem.  But this cap often hinders simple game play.<P>Please listen to the people who play this class, who play it every day and who play it well.  Seems to me we should know what we are talking about.<P>Shyelok<BR>Level 54 Minsterel<BR>Ayonae Ro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok...PLEASE make it so that the early healing song, hymm of restoration, has a cut off message...For example, chant of battle's cut off message is "you pulse slows" or something to that effect..  The beginning message for the hymm is "Your wounds begin to heal", so I was thinking something along the lines of "Your wounds re-open" or "Your wounds stop healing".  This would make twisting this song in transparent and regular mode a lot easier, because we wouldnt have to keep looking at the icons to see if hymm has worn off...<P>-Thank You<BR>--Denalae Thistlewind of Bertoxx</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I disagree with making these songs use mana.  Half the reason that I picked my bard is that I did not want to sit down and have to med all of the time.  Having bards use mana is a bad idea, as we are not using magic, we are singing songs to our group/enemies.  Mana is a very silly thing if you think about it.  "Whoa, I would like to sing a song to charm this moster, but I just don't have it in me.

</FONT><HR>I wanna start out by saying that if our bard class is a grouping class and are designed to enhance a group then why do a lot of our songs have stacking problems? we ENHANCE, so common sense is to let our songs stack and do there enhancing job. If that is to strong in Verant's eyes introduce a new line of haste that alone it does nothing but when used when people in the group(or yourself) have a haste on them(or other song) have the song enhance that effect. That way we can atleast be more group friendly, which we are the grouping class supposedly...yet enc seems to be that.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'll keep this simple:  <P>Twisting: <P>I don't think Verant will look at making this easier, in fact isn't twisting technically an exploit to begin with?  And for fumble-fingered folks like me with carpal tunnel...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Offense: <P>Maybe have a choice for bards once they hit 17: you can gain ONE of these: dual wield or double attack.  <P>Defense:<P>Parry and Riposte, both capped at 75, not gained until the 50's?  Useless to 99% of the bards out there and a 75% cap on a defensive skill in the 50's is pretty much worthless to begin with.  I'd say drop 'em.  <P>Items:<P>I don't want a specific new item added, new item arguements are at best moot for most bards because only high-level or uber guilds can farm them to begin with.  <P>Spellsongs: <P>Casters gain specializations that reduce fizzles and mana costs at higher levels.  Could there be a bard equivalent?  Pick an instrument type (wind, percussion, etc.) and those type of songs will have a reduced fizzle and *PERHAPS* increased duration or effectiveness. Say a for duration a linear increase up to a maxiumum of double duration by level 50 and triple duration by level 60 (in that 'specialization')?<P>Medding and mana...would it be too much to bring this ability up to the level of the other hybrids?<BR>Or perhaps a modest increase (cap med at 25 or 50?)<P>Utility: (group buffing, healing, speed, recovery)<P>Granted, no other class can do ALL the things we can.  But the specialists do it much, much, much better.  (More efficient, longer duration, more targets, stackable).  The point is here is the bard supposed to be the 'group-only' class at upper levels?  Then what one group ability should be improved to the point where bards are actually *WANTED* in a higher level group?<P>I'm at loss which ability I would want emphasized over the others because==&gt;<P>Vision:  <P>Before we go any further in saying what we as players want added, perhaps we should see what the bard class is actually supposed to do, per se.  Are we supposed to be offense tanks?  Then up the offense...if defense tanks, then up defense.  If songcasters, then improve song casting.  Just because we have a broad range of abilities, does that mean they all have to suffer?  Are we rogues?  (no I don't want the rogue signature ability backstab)<P>In terms of balance, other classes with a broad range of utility functions still can excel in one field or another, bards excel at none.  <P>Make the bard better in offense, defense, utility/songcasting and EVERYONE will want a bard...on the other hand right now the class past the middle levels is way underpowered with regards to other classes.  <P>Some could argue that bards are the forgotten utility (wide range of abilities) class.  Does the fact that bards are better at meleeing than other utility classes (druids and shamans come to mind) warrant that their magic area suffer to such an extent?  No I don't want druids or shamans nerfed either.  The point is to make the bard *MORE* effective, not other classes less so.<P>The real question is, a more effective what?<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Anyway, just my humble opinion and 2 cp.<P>Cheers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I have read or skimmed most of the messages up to this point, and because many of them seem to be focused on the high levels (50-60) I wanted to make sure that the lower levels get covered too. So here are my comments on the level 1-45 life of the bard. I play a level 46 bard with over 85 days logged. (No comments on efficiency please, I play for fun not power leveling.)<P>BARDS ROCK. This class is really fun to play. The fact that a bard gets a new song every level, while the power of older songs increases, really makes playing a bard a lot of fun. I have played other classes, and no other class has been as fun to play as my bard. In addition, I have found it very easy to find a group as a bard, as all melee types want haste, and all casters want the mana song. <P>So if "fun factor" of a class can be considered as part of balance, as I feel it should, then the bard (up to level 46) is excellent.  So please keep that in mind as you read these comments. Up to level 46, my bard has been nothing but fun to play.<P>I do have a few comments on various songs from level 1-46, which may help in balancing and fine-tuning the class:<P>Level 6 : HYMN OF RESTORATION : Great song! But once you get in a group with a druid or shaman, it can be a pain to use. It *does* stack with other regen spells, but they will not take hold if you are singing this effect. I always have to educate druids and shamans about this, and it would really be great if I didn't. Not really a BALANCE issue but certainly one that affects me a lot.<P>Level 15 : KELIN'S LUCID LULLABY : Area Effect Enthrall. I honestly cannot figure out how to use this song. It seems that this may be one of the few bard songs only useful for a very short period of a bards life, say from level 15 to 25 or so. This seems inconsistent with most other bard songs, that either get an upgrade or continue to be useful. I have tried singing this song full time while using weapons, singing this song full time with a lute, twisting this song with a lute and the healing song, and in my personal experience none of this works. Monsters either resist the song outright, or "throw" the song off immediately after it takes effect. In practice, my group does much better if I use other combinations of songs and weapons, and just forget about this song entirely. As a suggestion, perhaps make it require a string instrument (can currently be sung),  lasting only one pulse so it must be constantly refreshed, affect a maximum of 4 creatures (like rain spells), and decrease it's resistance. This would allow a bard to use this song for small crowd control, at the expense of his other benefits to the group (since he could not melee and would have to sing this full time.) Enchanters may feel that this infringes on their ability, but I would point out that a group with an AE Mez enchanter is much better off in this situation, because the Enchanter can provide other buffs (haste, etc) for the party during the battle and still Mez, whereas the bard could not. <P>Level 16 : TAREW's AQUATIC AYRE : Party Water Breathing. In practice this song is only useful as a backup if someone's water breathing spell wears off, simply because of it's low range. Even auto-follow does not keep people within adequate range to receive the benefits of the song, which means as soon as you start moving several members of your party start to drown. Increasing the range of this song would make it more useful, particularly in "quick water transit" situations. <P>Level 21 : MELANIE's MELLIFLUOUS MOTION : Party Random distance teleport. (ie- Yonder)  I admit, I cannot find a good use for it in combat situations. The several times I used it in an emergency, it only served to scatter my group to the five winds and make a bad situation even worse.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> But this is a WONDERFUL song for getting people unstuck. I am frequently receiving requests from people to come help them get unlodged from behind an oven or a small hut. Whereas normally they would have to wait many hours for assistance from a guide or GM, this song allows players to receive more immediate help from their local bard. Please consider this before making any changes to this song. (I've read a few).<P>Level 22 : ALENIA's DISENCHANTING MELODY : Party Strip Enchantment. I have had nothing but bad experiences when using this song. I believe its design was to strip negative magical effects that have been cast on your party, at the expense of also stripping buffs. So in a situation where someone had been rooted, or has heat blood (DoT), the bard could save the day by whipping out this song. Unfortunately, I have never been able to use it for this purpose. In the time it takes to communicate that someone needs the song, get out my lute and beginning singing, strip off all BENEFICIAL buffs first, and then FINALLY strip off their negative buffs, that person is usually dead, or no longer needs to be stripped. In fact, I may have actually killed them by stripping off their valor, or their symbol spell.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> This is a really bad way to make friends. My only suggestion here is to have this song strip in reverse order, so that the last buff/debuff to be cast on a player is the first one to get stripped. Or perhaps have this song strip ALL BUFFS AT ONCE from everyone in the party. This might still go very bad, but at least I could get to the source of the problem quicker. <P>Level 24 : LYSSA's VERACIOUS CONCORD : Party See Invisibility. Originally this song was a bard's only way of seeing invisible. However, a while back the Level 19 bard invisibility song was changed to also give the see invisibility component. Since that addition, I have had no reason to memorize this song. Perhaps giving it an additional minor effect (glimpse?) would give this song some sort of use. <P>Level 27 : SOLON's SONG OF THE SIRENS : Single Target Charm. This song feels a bit overpowered, at least up to level 38 or so. The reason I say a "bit" is that I have used this song to good effect in party situations, where it was basically a damage control song. In those cases, I do have to suffer the few seconds of taking abuse from two or more monsters as I try to get off a re-charm. It is the solo situation where this song really borders on being overpowered. This won't be a popular opinion. But here's why - A level 35 bard can solo two hill giants (not 1, not 3) using this song. It definitely takes practice, and has a definite risk associated with it, but it is very doable. I am not aware of any other class that can do this at this level range. Note that the later charm, which uses mana, deals with this fairly well. You can get off about 30 "pulses" of charm and then you are DONE singing charm for the next hour and a half. Perhaps adding a mana requirement (5 mana?) to this 27 charm would deal with the problem in a similar fashion. (I can hear the screams now.)  However, I do feel I should reiterate that the bard LOSES the power of this song at about level 38, where monsters become too high level to be affected by this charm. In the interest of balance, you should note that this is about the same level where some other classes GAIN the ability to solo two or more creatures (Quad kite, etc.) Just wanted to throw that in for reference.<P>Level 31 : AGILMENTE's ARIA of EAGLES : Party Levitation. Great song, but limited in usefulness by its range. When a party follows you on bard speed, they go just outside the reach of this song. This means we usually just get someone to cast levitation (spell) on the party instead of using the song. Increasing the range to that of bard speed would let a skilled bard move his party across rocky landscapes very quickly, by twisting levitation and speed. This seems like it would be a good thing.<P>Level 34 : CANTANA OF SOOTHING : Party Mana/Health/Stamina regen. I am confused about this song. It requires a stringed instrument, but does not stack with hymn of regeneration. So if you need healing, you are better off singing Hymn (healing) that has a much greater effect. It stacks with clarity (although prevents it from being cast, see level 6 song), and also stacks with manasong. However, it's not as effective as manasong, so if you need mana you are better off just singing manasong instead. If you need BOTH healing AND mana, you are better off twisting hymn and manasong. As for stamina, we have a stamina song too.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> So either this is not a very useful song, or there is an important detail I am missing. My suggestion would be to make it stack with Hymn of Regeneration, as this would give it a definite use when the party needs additional healing, at the cost of requiring the bard to get out his string instrument.<P>Level 35 : DENON's DISSENSION : AE Mana Drain. This song is in the back of my book, I was very excited to get it at level 35, and I have yet to figure out a use for it. Does this song really do anything? =) I did a test with a goblin firedrowser in the frontier mountains, where I alternated between mesmerizing him and twisting this song. After 3 minutes (via timer) of doing this, I let the mesmerize wear off, hoping that I had drained a significant portion of the goblin's mana. The goblin then pumped 12 (!!!) fire direct damage spells into me before I decided to get the heck outta there. I have spoken with other bards, and nobody I know can figure out a use for this song. It seems that creatures regen mana faster than this song drains it? I guess if you had two or more bards doing this it might work better.. but when was the last time you were in a group with two bards? =) My apologies if I am missing something about this song, I'm just trying to convey my personal experiences.<P>LEVEL 42 : McVAXIUS BERSERKER CRESCENDO : Party Haste + STR. Another song I'm confused about. This song appears to give about 18% haste and a strength bonus. (There are some that seem to think that this song makes your dual wield and double attack improve, but I have not observed this.) Using a horn increases the strength component significantly, but does not increase the haste percentage. The reason I am confused about this song is that bards get a similar haste song at level 36, VILIA's VERSES of CELERITY. The only difference I can see is that VILIA's gives agility, not strength. The haste difference seems to be minimal, if any at all. This begs the question, why would a bard use McVAXIUS? The extra armor class provided by VILIAs is considered preferable to the extra strength (personal opinion). And if I really want strength, I can twist in chant of battle (level 1 song) and get haste, agility, strength, and dex, an awesome combo. Was this song supposed to provide a progressive haste upgrade from Vilias (18%) to Verses of Victory (level 50 – 30%)? If so, increasing the haste percentage a few points (23%?) would make it seem like a clearer upgrade.<P>LEVEL 43 : DENON's DESPERATE DIRGE : Target - AE Direct Damage, one use. This song requires full mana to sing, and drains my entire mana pool. If you sing it, you are unable to sing it again or use your level 39 charm, and it takes almost 80 minutes to gain back a full mana bar. Because of this, this song is at the back of my book. With the things I am fighting at level 43, 313 damage just isn’t enough to warrant the cost, no matter how desperate I am.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> I just can't spare the slot.  Perhaps eliminate the mana cost, and put a recast timer on it, like a 20-minute timer? That might get it used once in a while, and it would still require a big commitment (initial memorization time and use of a slot) in order to use. Also, I think the damage component should increase much more significantly with level. (What is 313 damage to a level 50 creature? Less than 2 percent? Guessing here but seems like that’s pretty insignificant.)<P>LEVEL 44: CASSINDRA's ELEGY : Party- Increase INT and WIS. This song does what it's advertised, it increases wisdom and intelligence of everyone in your party for the next 15 seconds. In combat, this just isn't enough to make it useful. It can be used to give your casters some extra mana, but I have to keep twisting it (without even one fizzle where it wears off for a second) until all casters have burned off that extra mana. In practice, this is just more trouble than it is worth. You should be doing other things during the start of combat. The song is nice to help people learning trade skills, but otherwise has little use. My suggestion would be to increase its duration to something more like a minute, and it would become a more useful party buff  - Enough to start combat and burn off the mana before the effect wears off. <P>OTHER BARD ISSUES:<P>SONG INSTANT WEAROFF BUG: I know others have mentioned it, I just wanted to say that this is an everyday issue for me. I have reported it many times. My last posting to the bug board with more detail is http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum3/HTML/005472.html<P>EFFECTS: As a comment about current bard armor effects (Singing Steel, etc), please remember that a bard is ALWAYS singing- before combat, during combat, and after combat. If a bard takes the time to use an armor effect, he has to stop singing to do this. This means the effect has to be worth this time. Therefore my recommendation is that bard armor effects should be fast casting and long lasting, so we can get back to singing. What they do is an issue I leave up to Verant. (I like the idea of longer lasting versions of songs we already have, to save slots.)<P>POST-50: I am not level 50 yet, and so I cannot comment from personal experience. However I will say that even at level 46, my groups are starting to prefer Enchanter and Shaman buffs to my own, leaving me scratching my head as to how to best help the group. It sounds like this gets exponentially worse as the levels increase, leaving the bard less and less useful as our songs take second fiddle (Sorry) to other buffs. Charm is capped at 51, Fear is capped at 53, Mez is capped at 55. Haste goes to the enchanters.  I use all of these songs extensively right now, along with my party hastes. If all of these go away post-50… and my melee stays where it is… what’s left? =) If the answer is just manasong… aieeee!<P>Anyway this has turned into a HUGE post, and I apologize for the length. I just hope that some of these comments might prove useful. Remember, even after all that, Bards rock.  Thanks for a memorable few years, Verant.<P>-Belark Songstrider, Loremaster of the Red Maces 46th Bard of Drinal<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just took the time to print off the entire thread. I have noticed a lack of response to alot of it (especially in part 2 and 3). I will be reading through it and see if I can make some sense of what is being said. There seems to be some disparity between what the pre-planar bards and the post-planar ones actually want to see. Perhaps we can consolodate everything into one(long) post and see if we can get some answers.<BR>I personally have found that there are some thing I find lacking about the class.. <BR>1. There are very few songs that have remained useful throughout the life of my bard. Most seem to be songs that I will memorize and use maybe one or twice then forget I have. The ability to Identify objects is nice when doing the Tamborine quest but I have found little use for it beyond that. The lore on most items have little to no practical use. I can go on.. but I'm sure you are tired of hearing bards complain about the usefulness of their songs. <BR>2. Risk vs Reward and retuning. The Plane of Hate is a prime example. Mobs that take multiple groups to drop are dropping weapons like Evensong, Dawnchaser (God loot, 11/25, no effects or stats), and Six-note blade. Which were wonderful weapons Pre-Kunark, but to be honest, I had better before I went up to the Planes my first time with weapons I looted while in a single group. As these weapons are already no drop. Perhaps you can implement them as quest items in the currently broken bard weapon quest in Sol Temple. That would be a simple fix.. perhaps have Genni make a lambent diamond for the additional component.<BR>3. Pick Locks... Once again talked about alot. the current locks are well above our meager skill. I would be happy to be able to get in the north and west wings in Howling Stones. I'm sure others have named what few locks we can do, this would at least give the higher level people a lock they could get to.<BR>4. Quests... I am still a bit disapointed about the whole Fabian issue. It seemed like a bone thrown out to appease the bards while you worked on other projects. Problem was-- the quest was broken.. and to my knowledge still is. The Sol Temple Bard weapon text is still in place with no followup. No quests or items for bards that follow Veeshan... (No clerics to imbue gems for them either for the new jewelry-- perhaps add an imbued Veeshans Gem in Skyshrine?). Not a balance issue, but if there is a chance you are listening-- why not.<BR>5. Haste stacking.. no need to go any further there. It's been done to death here.<BR>There are alot of valid points in this thread. Hopefully some of them will be addressed and soon. I will honestly say that I had never thought the bard was underpowered.. I thought it was my ability to play him effectively. I would think that over time I would get better at playing my chosen class.. that perhaps I was at fault for not being as effective as I can. I see now that is not the case. If you have not reviewed Thott's data. Please do. I live to group.. I want to be an asset to my party, no matter what classes it is composed of. I do not want to be relegated to one or two effective songs at higher level, or to have my choices limited by the composition of my group.<P>Vesperr Honeytongue<BR>50 Bard, Dies Irae, Tribunal   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just read the stuff about the changes being tried on test, & had to post about them.<P>First, the defensive skills. I don't really think this will allow bards to be a 'defensive hybrid' (our hp are too low, & we get way too much agro from our songs in multiple pulls). However, this change could allow us to stay alive better, thus providing more benefit to our groups. Although I've only played to 35 so far, it seems to me that the main levels where 'smash-the-bard' occurs are the earlier levels -- by the time I was in my 20's, I'd learned stategies to avoid getting too much agro. Perhaps this will allow new, more agro-producing stategies to be effective for a longer period of the bard's career, but I'm not certain of the benefit at higher levels. *shrug*<P>OK, now the idea of giving Clarity at 20. ARE YOU INSANE?!! My gods, who came UP with this one? We spend PAGES & PAGES on these talks, & EVERY bard thread before this saying that we are SICK of being viewed as a manabattery. VI's solution? Make us a manabattery EVEN SOONER!<P>AAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!<P>I am SO upset about this! Probably bards' major complaint, even more than the manabattery thing, was the feeling that we aren't LISTENED to. Well, thanks for CONFIRMING that one!<P>OK -- I know it's test & subject to change, yadda, yadda. But that's exactly why I posted now, & as strongly as I did -- so you can STOP this INANE idea from reaching the live servers!<P>Snapdragyn Feybaerd &lt;Mystic Alliance&gt;, Bar... no, MANABATTERY of the Thirty-fifth Song<BR>'If a bard sings in the woods, does anybody at VI really listen?'<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Our class is not wanted in a group to tank... and this change will not rectify the L50+ bard problem where we are unwanted in groups, and basically such at L50+.<P>Moving clarity to L20? Who cares? Pre L35 bards are ultra powerful to start... this definitely doesn't help us L51 bards who sit LFG all day.<P>I mean, considering the SIGNIFICANT POWER INCREASE of the other hybrids, especially SKs and Palies, who are ALREADY SIGNIFICANTLY MORE USEFUL IN A GROUP, you'd expect a little more...<P>I mean, if you moved DA song to L52... and double the effectiveness of L34 mana/heal song as well as the L55 song... THEN I could see that there were improvements.<P>But as a L51 bard who avoids tanking in the first place, these changes don't HELP me get into groups, rather make a bunch of other classes MORE EFFECTIVE in group, thus widening the gap between bards and the rest of the classes.<P>Thanks for the indirect nerf verant.<P>-Cueller</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>At early lvls, bards are very limited with whom they can effectively group; specifically, there is no real benefit from us grouping with casters before lvl 30, when we get our MR debuff.  This makes it difficult to get invited into a group which isn't mostly melee.  Part of this is due to the fact that we dont have any good taunt effects, and it is difficult for us to outdamage the caster, so we cant very effectively take a tanking role.  This has been alluded to in earlier postings, but I'd like to give one idea I haven't yet seen that would help remedy this problem. <BR>Would it be possilbe to make our songs effect pets?  This would make for much more interesting grouping possibilities with the pet classes, specifically necros and magicians, and even the occasionall druid and enchanger who really like to use their low lvl charms.  If it would somehow be imbalancing, maybe make the songs have a lesser effect on our pets than they would on a true tank class.<P>Another major problem is the uselessness of our levitation song.  Sure, we can use it to travel alone, but whats the point of being a bard if your not in a group, particularly by the lvl we get this song.  We cant even just have it available and use it for the rare short distance uses (running along, group comes to a chasm, turn on lev and go across carefully) because it takes so long to mem it :<BR>     (Another issue thats already been brought up; I personally agree with Verant's stance on bard mana regen, its used to regulate our unusually powerful songs, and it doesn't infringe on our function otherwise.  However, we absolutely need a faster memorization rate, escpecially for our little emergency songs (cure poison/disease etc).  It cant be a balance issue; Some may argue that a bard being able to mem songs like a caster would give them an ability they do not currently have, the ability to sit down and mem a song they need in the middle of battle.  However, this ability is a necessity to make a slew of our songs really usefull (the ones that would only be brought out under unusually circumstances), and how unbalancing could it really be when one keeps in mind that we can really only use 3 of our spells at once.  In summary, plz determine some way to raise bard meditation without increasing mana regen rate.)<P>Back to Lev<BR>Unless lev is to be delegated to the rare random use category as discussed above, it needs one or several changes.  Again, if the point isn't to be able to use it for those long dangerous runs, what is?  However, as it is, its area of effect its way to small, and there is a horrible risk of lev wearing off of group members and them falling to their 10,000 hp death, due either to lag or negligence(I told you to /tell me if I got too far ahead of you  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> ).  An increase in the area of effect would help alot, and the delay of the song lasting once the group member is out of the bards radius is actually pretty good.  The problem is that even once they are out of range, and the song has about 3 more ticks before it drops them, they are given no warning that the song is about to go.  A simple "you feal you're about to drop message" given on the last few ticks and only once they are out of the bards range would fix this problem nice and easy.  I heard at some point that it was removed by user request, but honestly I believe those users need to be shot  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> .I don't see how it could be a problem if implemented correctly.  <P>Thanks for letting us be heard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hello again,<P>I was a wee disappointed that what I felt were some quality suggestions on my part way back in Part Two of this discussion, but by this time I have little cause to feel singled out.  Ah well.  One wonders if Absor had any notion of the can of worms a Bard Revamp would open.<P>Anyway, the purpose of this post is not to condemn Verant further, but to ask for a "wait and see" view of the new Test server Bard stealth enhancements that went up today.  Sure, if they comprise the sum total of steps that VI takes to balance our class, I will most assuredly retire my 52nd level Bard in disgrace and seek my gaming elsewhere.  However, surely that will not be the case.<P>The main problem I have with the new defense cap is with actually attaining it.  Am I required to pay a Cleric to sit back and simply heal me while I tank ultra-low blues until my defense skill is raised?<P>During normal combat, there is simply no way that my defense will raise on its own.  I can't do enough tanking in a regular party to justify my being hit, so I either leave that to a real tank or I sit at the very furthest reaches of my Chant range and shake my drums at the monsters.<P>So, while I would be absolutely mad to tell VI to take their defense skill back, I just don't know how it will benefit me or any of the other Bards I know.  Unless maybe we get some sort of enhancement to our improvement speed or credit to our Defense skill based on how high it is now...<P>Oh, and one last suggestion regarding the Pick Locks issue.  The problem at hand is how to reward Rogues for being essentially the "masters" of picking locks without removing our ability to be useful in high-level locked dungeons.  My solution is this: make the length of time it takes to pick a lock dependant on the strength of the lock and the amount of skill you currently have.  The lock on the First Floor of Befallen, for example, should take just about as much time as it does right now to open, even for a beginner in the skill.  The most challenging locks in the game should take a Rogue no more time to open (with his skill maxed out) than it does right now, to simulate his enhanced abilities.  But if a Bard with his skill maxed out were to attempt to open that door, it would take perhaps 10 seconds to do so, maybe even 20 seconds.  Still incredibly useful, and still a reason to have a Rogue in the party.<P>Anyone else agree?<P><BR>Thanks,<P><BR>Alto HalfElfis the Craven</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Offense vs. Defense<P>As it stands, bards are 3rd tier tanks due to the ac on armor (warriors being 1st, pally/sk being 2nd) Since any one mob can only hit one person at a time, which is generally one of these other 3 classes, what use is more defensive skills to a bard? Even if we were given all 3 warrior skills up to the same level that a warrior has, our lack of pure ac still puts us somewhere around the tanking ability of sk/pally.<P>Bards are also 3rd tier on offense, ignoring weapons (which would help the other classes anyhow) warriors have dual wield/double attack, pally/sk with just double attack get the added primary hand bonuses. Unlike tanking abilities, offensive skills is something anyone can use to help a fight. Even wizards when fighting magic immune mobs get in there and whack the stuff with their staves, its not much, but it adds to the fight. So adding a low capped double attack will allow us to add more to a fight. Personally, I'd give up all my defensive skills to have double attack, since the rare occasion when I'm tanking, I'm usually dead anyhow, or at least backing right out of the fight.<P>In a 'perfectly balanced' group there should be 1 of every class. With the warrior tanking, everyone else should be able to go into a fight naked and not change the outcome. So if we're going to give something, please give us something we can use when theres 20+ other people in our 'group'.<P><BR>BurninSun</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>All these complaints about chain. Jeez.<P>I have zero problems with the way chain works. None.  I can sing chain and snare a mob that a Druid can't because snare gets resisted.  I don't have huge problems with it getting resisted and when it does get resisted, I sing it again.  At the point in the fight, my group doesn't need the other buffs, except for haste, until that mob is dead.<P>I also don't have big problems with it wearing off immediately.  Only certain mobs have a quick recovery from it, and a second chain usually sticks.  Bard snare is not supposed to be like other snares.  It stops runners when they run.  It is not meant to work like druid snare, which can be cast at the start of a fight and last until the mob is dead.  It is all about strategic use of your songs. <P>Chain is just fine the way it is.

</FONT><HR>Bards have ways of taunting that aren't explicitly taunt.  Crisson's Pixie Strike is a decent taunt.  Two of those can taunt a mob off off a caster (except maybe a wizard).<P>Anything that raises you on the hate list of a mob will lower the caster's position.  With tanks beating it up, a couple of Pixie Strikes and the caster is all but forgotten.<P>Charm is yet another excellent taunt device.<P>It amazes me how much people don't know about their own class.<P>And if I hear one more request for a bind affinity song...if you can't make friends as a Bard, then what good are you?  I never have a problem getting TPs, Rezes, or TLs.  Maybe your poor playing style that is the reason you feel underpowered.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As far as I can see, there are two routes for Verant to take to handle bards correctly (Hint - more mana songs ISNT ONE OF THEM &lt;slaps whoever thought that was a good idea&gt; ). Both of them would make us more useful in big raids. <BR>You could improve the damage we do. Personally, this doesn't seem to fit in with the definition of bards, but this is one way to help us. It's already been shown how badly ALL songs scale up, ESPECIALLY post 50. We all also know that bards do not dish out particularly good melee damage. You have shown you want us to be "defensive hybrids" (more on that later).<BR>Or you can make haste (and to a lesser extent, slows) stack. When there is an enchanter in the group, the usefulness of a bard RAPIDLY decreases. You don't want us to be able to help with CC effectively - our inferior mezzes always overwrite enchanter ones, and cannot themselves be overwritten. Haste is the biggest thing, along with mana regen, we have to offer a group. When an enchanter joins the group, out direct effectiveness drops RAPIDLY. No other two classes are so incompatible that when one joins, the other class is reduced in what he/she can offer the group so dramatically!<BR>Because in EQ, hastes add up, rather than multiply, the addition of bard haste to enchanter haste would add the same amount of extra damage as adding bard haste to a completely non-hasted party would.<BR>Also, coming back to the bards as defensive hybrids thing...if you are really serious about it, then parry/riposte need to be moved to a normal level and given decent skill-caps, as must dodge, never mind about pitiful HPs....<BR>Its all very well calling us defensive hybrids, but we need to be treated as them too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053745&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053745&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
