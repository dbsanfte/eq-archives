</FONT><HR>One final thing for now.<P>Sometimes even if you leave a monster's melee range feign won't work for no apparent reason.  Sometimes when you're soloing feign won't work for no apparent reason.  Sometimes when you're pulling feign won't work for no apparent reason.  I know this mostly happens when I'm lagged or if my screen freezes for a second right as I feign.  I don't think this is related to the bug I talked about in my long post.<P>aight.

The most important things for monks to have fixed in my oppinion are FD, stuns, AC, resistances, and equipment weights.<P>For personal play reasons, a reduction to the delay of fists to be equal to the lowest weapon dealy would be greatly appreciated.

</FONT><HR>Many of my areas of concern have been covered. But in the looks department, I have a strong suggestion:<P>Give us gear that looks like Darth Maul, and I would be happy with the look of a monk. Just do it once, for two races(iksar, human) and tint it for variety. That's only four sets of graphics(two races times two sexes). C'mon, you can do it! You don't even have to rip off the Darth Maul look close enough to get Uncle George mad...just model it off an actual gi.<P>Oh, and while your at it...everyone knows the range and effectiveness of throwing stars is a joke. You need to add poisonous throwing stars and, using the black pearl model, stun and/or fire-based explosive spheres that look like the fire-based caster attack and do moderate damage. <P>And while your at it, why not give monks the ability to make thier own projectile weapons? Monks are always broke because they cannot hold cash or loot treasures. Shamen have alchemy...why not give the monk the ability to make poisonous and disease ridden stars and explosive and stunning spheres. <P>Any Ninja will tell you it's part of a martial artists kit. One advantage is they don't have to chase a fleeing mob all over kingdom come if they can toss a stun at them from a distance. Another advantage is that they can create these items and resell them to anybody for a little pocket change, and they won't always have to be beggers.<P>I have 20 stars in my inventory that I haven't used in 6 levels, because I have to get so close to tag them I might as well tag them with my fist.<P>Oh, and while your at it, how about increasing the range that you can throw the items? Like half again as far?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A slight amount of inherant monk haste needs to be added.  Monks should be able to use the same 1h blunts and 2h blunts faster and more effectively than other classes.<P>Chain attacks and putting the kick and punch on different timers are very good ideas. With time give all attack specific effects that makes them worthwile. Greatly increase the learning rate of secondary attacks so that it is possible to make all secondary attacks useful.<P>Add additional perks in damage for the hand to hand skill that will come over time.  Add additional monk weapons that will increase the effectiveness of the hand to hand skill. IE: Add a serious of gloves that give various stats and haste on monk hand to hand ONLY.  Therefore, you have an item that will have benefit throughout the levels.<P>Personally I believe that all quests require too much time.  A rare 72 minute spawn is torture from every angle (*cough* treant fists quest and lets not even go into the 200 hour AVERAGE camp for Raster).  If you are high enough to obtain the item through killing the appropriate mobs you should be able to obtain the item. PERIOD.<P>All the headbands and sashses need to be made worth wearing.<P>Give all melees the ability to be boound outside a city.  Why not?  This would make melees go to those horribly underpopulated zones because bind points are too far away and soften the blow of bad faction to some races.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Disciplines have too short of a duration period.<P>Thunderous Kick should be in effect for multiple kicks throughout the duration of the discipline.  Minimum damage for this has been discussed already.<P>Feign Death is broken when grouped and you feign near or in the battle.  Somehow the hate list modifications have introduced a bug that let monsters see through successfull feigns more so than regular saves vs feign.<P>Fist Damage should increase more per level than they current do.<P>Celectial Fists should stack with other speed buffs.<P>Treant Fists deserve to be upgraded due to the difficulty acquiring them.  They used to have an effect on them that was removed.  Put it back or some other effect.  The Gem gauntlets that are now flooding the game are just as good and 10 times easier to get.<P>Shiverback armor has pitiful AC for Planes Armor.<P>Monk natural AC needs to be increased or somehow monks should get bonuses for AC from agility and dexterity.<P>Stun chance added to special attacks.<P>The quest monks in Rathe Mtns. and South Karana(Zephyl and Quinn) should NOT drop the quest Robe of the Lost Circle.  This shortcut belittles the quest for those of us who do it and is indeed an unfair shortcut to the Epic, Celestial Fists.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It is about time Verant has finally fixed the monk problems and bugs, but with our luck Verant wont do anything. They have turned there backs on us monks far to long, and only recently after a couple of years do they face us once again. We are the class that were forgotten and cared little for. We are no longer pullers, dmg dealers, or do we evade shots. I have played my monk to lvl 40 and I have quit him. He no longer is any fun, hes is a chore that i do everyday when i get on to play my favorite game. Our FD is bugged, and so we usually die trying to pull for our groups. We bring back 2 mobs to the group only to have 7 more come in. We wipe out groups, we are the leading causes of trains. We no longer deal any dmg, because warriors have much better weapons then us, and our hands can not keep up. We cant defend ourselves because we are weak. We have no hp/ac/and not as much atk any more. We are the class that verant forgot about and cared little for. Im glad that Verant finally looks back on us for once.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor -- Suggestion for a revision to the "Monk Combo Attack" idea.<P>Instead of firing the various attacks off of some fictitious triple attack kind of thing, why not require mastery of an attack before it has a good chance of working?  <P>Something like:<BR>1) Flying Kick<BR>--assuming a successful Flying Kick<BR>2) ((Double Attack + Dragon Punch)/2) / 252 percent chance of a Dragon Punch<BR>--assuming a successful Dragon Punch<BR>3) ((Double Attack + Eagle Strike)/2) / 504 percent chance of an Eagle Strike<P>Naturally, you'd want to mess with the numbers (especially since the numbers I just rattled off give a 100% chance of triggering a DP on a successful FK) but this way you must be a true Master of an attack before you can chain it in combat. <P>Seems to make more sense to me, anyway.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I saw an earlier suggestion that we somehow be allowed to change our deity.  I especially like this idea, since I have always role-played my Iksar monk as being opposed to Cazic Thule's hold over the Iksar.  Unfortunately, I am not given a way to play this out to its logical conclusion.  I realise that changing deity's within the game would be difficult to implement, and it should be difficult to do, but you have already done something similiar with the Book of Discord.  In my opinion, it should be a mid-level quest, and while it would give some small amount of faction with followers of the chosen deity, it should cause a massive negative change with followers of the char's original deity, and all that deity's followers.  After all, I think a follower of Cazic Thule would have a great amount of resentment and hatred for someone who has turned his or her back on Cazic.  And the bonus faction for switching would not be enough to allow a convert full access to, say, Freeport or Qeynos, it would be a good start down that path.  The reason for only a small positive change would be that the followers of the new deity would still distrust a recent convert, especially if that convert was one of the hated races, such as Iksar.  <P>Personally, this would be the most fulfilling quest I could think of in the game, because it would allow for more RPing.  Again, I know it's not likely to be implemented, given the nightmarish requirements involved in balancing it all out, but isn't it strange how things that are difficult usually end up being the most rewarding things we can strive for?  <P>BTW, I would also like to see lower level (20+) monks be able to stop spellcasters.  It's not fun when you're running Kurn's, and a green burynai excavator caster can still waste you.  Even less fun at 25+, when the sappers get DoT and disease-based spells.  And yes, I solo.  A lot.  Almost exclusively, actually, because it is not easy to find a group willing to run the places I want and need to.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This list has MARJORLY left out various issues that monks have!  Please! Re-read the monk discusion.  The concerns on the list are at best understated.<P>There is a lot of focus on messing with the special attackes but none on fixing various things with Feign Death!  Like the fact that it does not work at ALL when there is an NPC/pet hitting the mob, and how it almost always fails when our health is low... and that is when we need it MOST. (it should be the other way around)<P>Forget about post-50 for a moment.. monks are already depowered post 40.  All the classes have cheap terrific weapons they can have, and good resistances.  Look at who's getting taken on most raid lists... one monk.. maybe.  We are looked at as a liability since now we can't pull, we can't do good damage, and we are three times the mana sink of any other class if a caster is involved because of our bad resistances, and lack of resistance armor.  <P>We do not want to have a couple diffricult to code things that will *possibly* make us look slightly neater, but in the ned not really help us.<P>We want to be able to NOT outtaunt a warrior while he is doing barely less damage.<P>We want NOT to be such utter and complete caster bait we are pretty much told not to get involved.<P>We want to be useful to groups.  We do not want to be warriors who can't take hits (our current role)<P>We want to be able to viably use our hands!<BR>This means:<BR>A) Increasing the damage<BR>B) fixing the skill cap level pre-50<P>We want to have class specific armor that we would actually WEAR.  That means AC and resists.<P>We want black panther armor to NOT weigh more that most ALL/ALL things that we could find.<BR> <BR>PLEASE take a look at what monks are wearing!  A great many do not wear ANY class specific armor.  Maybe the Shiverback boots adn gloves, sometimes the jerkin (though rarely) and that's about it.<P>Look at what monk gear often looks this:<BR>-Gem Encrusted Gauntlets -(much easier to get than Treant fists, plus can always be sold if the monk stops using them<P>Azure Sleeves- easier to get, and twice as good as any other monk sleeves out there.<P>Gator scale legs, much better AC than almost any monk leggings.<P>Froglok Crown - It has resistances, it has AC.  Our other armor has neither.  (crecent headband anyone?)<P>Players wear ALL/ALL armor rather than their PLANAR gear.  We are talking Plane of Growth here? I mean what gives?  How about making some decent items?<P><BR>Please look at the our request list again.  There are a lot of things which have been left out.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I like this list, but I have another suggestion for helping a few issues. I would like to see the Celestial fists changed to make fists ~20/26 weapons. I really would like to see us doing more damage per attack at a slower rate. <P>The overall average damage output should be approximate to our current epic, although a slight upgrade might be warrented. This would give us a damage upgrade as well as serve to keep us lower on the agro list.<P>Of course, the stacking issues with the effect need to be addressed as well. I love our epic, but I think it could be improved to suit our needs a bit  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>20/26 would barely increase the primary hand performance of celestial fists, but would greatly improve offhand performance (unless our offhand is made to act like our primary hand in the future).

</FONT><HR>I have to agree with Grizzly down there about 6 post ago.  The monk should be based off real martial arts.  They should be comepletly reconstructed.  Yes this would make a big change in the game.  Now maybe if this were to take place a whole new class would be made, like a ninja class or something, but this is about the monk.  In martial arts you use resources around you, and your fist.  In the game monks now use weapons.  I am one of the only monks still using my fist.  Also monks in the game have no way to interact with their surroundings.  The monk should be able to run while attacking and use surronding resources as weapons and ways to help in  their attack.  I know this may sound no possible but i think if it is possible either the monk class should be reconstructed or they ninja class or some sort should be made.  Which everyone occurs it should be based off the true martial arts,  and when designed the designer or assistant designer should have a background knowledge of martial arts.<BR>55 lvl monk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Kunark has imbalanced the entire game. Where classes were balanced the manner in which “Kunark” was implemented was poorly done and simply ruined some major melee classes.<P>This comparison gives some hard core data on pure melee classes– although some commentary are more based on personal experience, I have played the game since the inception. Some comments are meant to be funny and should be taken as such – there is no intent to flame anyone and when you read it apply the humor where it should be applied.<P>Defense Pre-expansion<P>Monk	Warrior		Rogue<P>230	200		200<P>Expansion<P>252	252		252<P>Increase in skill power.<P>9.6%	26%		26%<P>Compensation <P>Monk - No new armor. Warrior -New insane Ac armor WITH SPELLS. Rogue new uber chain armor with spells.<P>Evaluation:	Substantial decrease in the defense power of the monk without ANY compensation compared to other pure melee classes.<P>What should have happened? A significant increase of the Monk’s Hit points to increase tanking/defense ability. If the regular skills did not go up, the AC, HP, new defense skill or a combination of all three should have taken place.<P><BR>Offense Pre-expansion<P>Monk	Warrior	Rogue<P>230	200	210<P>Expansion<P>252	252	252<P>Increase in skill power.<P>9.6%	26%	20%<P><BR>Monk and Warrior (high level) duel wield items of the same exact same type. Thus, basically producing a warrior with monk like damage with incredible Hit points and AC. Enter the Warrior “God class” of melee. The Rogue getting new weapons and skills having incredible damage output with virtually no penalty. The rogue can solo on a guild events and receive zero damage and still get the kill versus multiple groups of 6. <BR>Expansion - Monks were introduced with high damage “two handed weapons”. There is a reason warriors use duel wielding weapons over “two handed weapons”. (Paladins do about 25% of the damage of a well-equipped duel-wielding warrior). It’s pretty incredulous to place a 2 handed weapon on a class that has always had the premier signature duel wield attack. What were even more unthinkable were monk only weapons that weighed more than steel two-handed weapons.<P>Background – Monks were the “King of Offense” they paid the price with low ac items, low hit points, and a significant weight restriction but were balanced with much higher defense skills to compensate. Post expansion destroyed the balance.<P>Monk weapon/offense skills<P>1st number pre-expansion skill caps. 2nd post expansion skill caps. 3rd number percentage increase.<P>HTH	<BR>240,252, 5%<P>1HB<BR>240, 252, 5%<P>2HB<BR>240,252, 5%<P>Kick<BR>200,250,25% (never used)<P>Tiger Claw<BR>200,225,12.5% (never used)<P>Eagle Strike (Hardly ever used)<BR>200,225,12.5%<P>Dragon punch (Hardly ever used)<BR>200,225,12.5%<P>Flying Kick (Signature special attack)<BR>200,225,12.5% Still trying to understand why our signature attack was only increased to 225 instead they raise kick to 250.

After the expansion, not only did they exceed monks damage ability “one” rogue could easily out damage a full group with a couple of monks being in the group.  Although the damage a Rogue can do can’t be seen via this evaluation, the “skill” of back stab is almost to the point of being unbalancing.

However, it allows the Rogue to do unlimited amounts of damage without every worrying about the “hate list”.  Poor rangers begged for something like this but got a horrible spell version versus a Rogue’s simple click.<BR>Click!!  Hear that? That’s the Ranger hitting the ground dead.<P><BR>Melee classes that need to be fixed is:  Monk, Paladin, SK and Ranger. Even though I did not go into the hybrid versus parent fight, these classes need some significant improvements. Paladins and SK must get a significant improvement on the damage dealing side. Rangers need evade or “gasp” a little more defenses. Its good to have a “Vision” and to make a class offensive and defensive but you have a bad tendency of over applying your “Vision” by giving double, triple and quadruple penalties.<P>Since my post was over looked and none of my suggestions even looked at by power to be – I felt more was needed.<P>My suggestions:<P>Pre-expansion monks could tank but in a different way. We tanked with the use of our superior defense skills via the huge skill gap.  Unfortunately, this was reduced significantly – making the warrior have Monk like – Evasion skills. Warriors needed the extra Hit points to tank, we did not. This statement no longer holds true.<P>Example:<P>Monk		   Warrior			<P>230(1000hps at X)  200	(2000hps at X level)				<P>Expansion<P>252(1000hps at X)  252	(2000hps at X level		<P>It only stands to reason we should be at 2000hps because we now have the SAME defense skill<P>However, this is not the only Defense skill set so lets continue.		<P>Monk		Warrior<BR>Dodge		Dodge<P>200		140<P>Expansion<BR>Dodge		Dodge<P>230		175<P>Since our dodge skill is better we should have a reduction in Hit points. However, lets continue before we attempt this.<P> <P>Obviously Block and Parry are not the same but they do the same thing. However, a Warrior’s INSANE ac should cover any difference a block advantage over a parry skill check.<P>Monk			Warrior<BR>Block			Parry<BR>200			200<P>Expansion<BR>Block			Parry<BR>230			230<BR>As far as final defense score they are the same, therefore we will not modify the hit points.<P><BR>Monk		Warrior<BR>Disarm 		Disarm <BR>200		200<P>Expansion <BR>Disarm 		Disarm <BR>200		200 <BR>Another push.<P>Monk<BR>Riposte		Riposte<BR>200		200<P>Expansion<BR>Riposte		Riposte<BR>225		225<P>Another Push.<P>Now lets balance the Monks and Warrior skills versus hit points compared to pre-expansion when things were balanced to post Kunark.<P><BR>Lets add all the final Defense scores:<P>Defense + Dodge + Block + Disarm + Riposte<BR>Monk total =  1137<BR>Vs<BR>Defense + Dodge + Parry + Disarm + Riposte<BR>Warrior total =  1082<P><BR>Now its basic math to figure out what the monk hit points should be.<P><BR>(1082/monk hit points) X (1137 /2000hps)<P>Monk hit points should  = 1903hps Versus a Warrior with 2000hps at X level.<P>Or<BR>1082 / 1137 = 95.16%   A monk should have 95.16% hit points of a warrior at the same level.<P><BR>HOLD IT!?!?!

</FONT><HR>Absor, just had a thought on the Celestial Fist stacking problem. Before Velious there was two areas of haste: item and spell/song. Now another one has been created so that the Eyepatch of Plunder stacks with all other hastes. A simple way to fix the Celestial Fist stacking problem would be to put it on the same haste tree as the Eyepatch.<P>This would give a monk a large advantage in haste, but we have no advantage with our effect on our item anyway due to the fact that we aren't a soloing class and 80-90% of the time we're gonna be in a group with either an enchater or bard (which all melee classes are going to get the same haste). Other classes gain combat effects on their items, a superlitive haste for the monks would be a defining ability.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It has been asked that monks recieve a specialization like spellcasters do.  Now everyone agrees that monks need a damage upgrade, but noone can agree on how this can be done. So, how about pleasing a lot of people via this route?<P>Specialization: Tiger Claws<BR>Unhook Fists and Feet from each other.<P>Specialization: Thousand Blossoms<BR>Allows chaining attacks (Sucessful Flying Kick triggers a chance for Dragon Punch, etc.)<P>Specialization: Sticks and Stones (Hey - I'm running out of ideas for names, k?)<BR>Allow a monk wielding a weapon to have either a mild haste effect or a damage boost (or both) but only to the weapon being wielded.

</FONT><HR>I just posted a message about 3 hours ago.  I have gave this whole monk thing thought.  In the mist of it i just saw a movie based all on monks, and monks moves.  Monks should be given more damage, and some new moves, like we should be able to use surrondings for help, and use the enemies(when multiple) against each other.  Monks need to be reconstructed to be more like monks, we are just almost like a poor warrior in the game.   We use to be able to say we just use our fist cause they are the best, but now we cannot say that since there are better weapons.  If there is going to be weapons for a monk, they should be monk weapons(numchucks and sticks).  Monks just need to be able to get better in the game.  We should also be a soloing class since monks or in modern day martial arts, you never see a grouping of people they solo.  We should solo for this reason.  I really think that the whole monk class should be reconstructed and that some of the thinks are ok, but we just need to be better and relate more to martial arts.  If anyone has a comment on this though please do a reply post.  I would like some feed back on this topic.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ABSORs latest comments about rangers shows his concern on balance:<P>Rangers are complicated. Give them enough offensive power and not enough defense, and they die a lot. Up their<BR>                    defense and they start to be more valuable in any group than a warrior. Neither solution works. Therefore, Jolt.<P>                    But if Jolt is too good, then the low defense of a ranger is no longer a drawback, and they again become overpowered...<P>                    It's very complicated. But I suspect that I understand it as much as almost anyone.<P>                    What you need to understand is that just because you have great offensive power does not mean that you can just use<BR>                    it as if it was a fire hose. Rangers need to learn the lessons that Rogues and Wizards learn early in their careers. Just<BR>                    because you CAN do a ton of damage, doesn't mean you should.<P><BR>he is afraid of taking away from warriors roles<P>WELL THE MONK IS THE ONLY MELEE CLASS THAT CANNOT TAUNT... so you never have to worry about us replacing as TANKS... i have been turned down NUMEROUS times for main tank position because i cannot taunt... which means death for casters if they get aggro<P>there is NO REASON why you shouldnt increase monk damage 50% above warriors... we will never be able to replace tanks due to our lack of taunt<P>WHAT YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT is monks being replaced by other melee type classes as a secondary melee class!... if warriors and rangers do so much damage then there isnt a need for a monk, if rogued do SO MUCH MORE damage then there really really really isnt a need for a monk<P>remember... we dont have a TAUNT skill... that automatically screws us for MAIN TANKS even if we have awesome armor class and hit points</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Both of our wars were sam lvl as the other groups war.  All the warriors were 7 lvls above the rogue and i was 4 lvls above the rogue.  Our group never got the exp.  Eqip was all high end stuff with the rogue using ragebringer of course.  That means the Rogue outdmged myself and a warrior.  I felt so useless...cause no way i could take dmg like the warrior.<P>With warriors doin 1-30 dmg kicks, monks doing 3-130 kicks, and rogues doing 60-400plus backstabs...I'm getting behind the monks need A LOT more dmg bandwagon =).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ridge your post was great, acouple things i would like to amend/add to it...<P>1st off i am strongly for leaving feign as itis (except fixing the under 2 bubbles thing) as it is now it isnt 100% which seperates those who spend time learning to play their class from those who dont, and you dont need to be any lvl to play your class well just using thought.<P>now the skills etc, i think it ws a nice breakdown, only problem is due to their coding 252 is the highest they can make a skill go.. since they already have warriors there how can they upgrade us? and ac has a soft capof 1100 also keep in mind.<P>well more hps would be one thingfor defensce, better yet... entirely new skill (defensive) maybe something like:<P>toughness, works like block<BR>i.e. such and such hits YOU but YOU shrug itoff. or something like that. cap 252.<P>more ac past the cap isworthless, hps are so so but kinda are blending usmore so with warriors. another skill that involves us somehow completely blocking out/not gettin hit ismore in character for us quick nimble fighters and will be a lotmore useful than still inferior hps ormore useless ac.<P><BR>and for offence, one more thing to add to your argument.. <BR>our epic weapons make our fists 9/16 ratio of... 0.5625, <BR>warrior epic is 14/25 ratio of 0.56. <P>or we can look at the top end stuff...<P>monk 2hbton po bo stick of understanding 44/40, ratio 1.1 (veeshans peak)<P>war 2hs: tempered vellium claidmore 32/35, ratio 0.914.... (this thing is usable by war pal rnd sk btw!!!) but one triple attack from a war more than makes up for this ratio deficit in a round, an ability we dont have. (necropolis)<P>in the 2handed variety monks have the advantage in ultra high end stuff, but lets look at the 1handed (where the real damage is)<P>monk 1handers (no not our fists silly, those suck)<P>neb's warbone 15/23 0.652... guess what... warrior can use it too. (necropolis)<P>and this isnt even touching on the insanity that is dropping in sleepers tomb (ofwhich i couldnt find ratios for) their weapons are just as good as ours! our fists suck, even WITH the epic boost, they were good in kunark, but in SoV high end game noperoo. <P>solution, change the monk damage tables, have it say add on an extra 3 dmg to our weapons, that 15/23 club for a war, is 18/23 for us.<P>most of these changes, no offense guys, but they suck. using our whopping 20 dmg lvl 5 melee skills in tandem with our flying kick isnt gonna do jack to put us where we should be damage wise. making shiverback better isnt gonna help, they arent going to makeit better than kunark/pog/random dropped stuff in sov. a new skill will help us (as i described above) no matter what kinda armor is there or what our ac is compared to a warrior, and better yet.. you dont even have to LOOT it, its an innate ability (isnt that what monks are all about?) same with damage tables with an extra 3 dmg 9/16 -&gt; 12/16 is suddenly lookin really nice right on par with high end weapons (thats monk epic fist btw with a +3 dmg modifier) anda monk can choose to go with fists over weapon, while still not as good the difference is negligable, and i would loose an extra 10 dmg a round for not looking stupid carrying what has to be the ugliest weapons (most monk 1handers) in existance.<P>1)fix the fd bug (the under 2 hp one) and leave the rest as it is.<P>2)give us a new and unique additional block<P>3) triple attack at 60, or "triple weild" maybe would be more monkish (i.e. instead of a max combo of {triple attack} right right right left left, you would have {say flurry or someting} right right right left left left, and it woudlnt affect 2hb at all.<P>4) increased dmg tables, while our weapons would be almost the same ratios we would do more damage with them.<P>5) maybe toss in more scaled weight incrase also instead of lumps at 55 and 60.<P>addendum: if adding another defensive ability is out of the question mechanically, maybe just make block go off 2x as much would do the same exact thing.<P>anyway i think those are about the only real changes that would put us squarely where weneed to be.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Something that seems forgotten by everyone is that monks have a difficult standing against spellcasters. First monks have no resistance boni against spells. Second a monk have much lesser HP than a warrior. Result: A monk goes down much faster than a warrior. And because of the lack of light resist stuff for monks. The monks are mana sinks for the healers.<P>Solution: Give monks the skill "Iron Will": Available at lvl 10. Cap: 200/250. Increases all resistances by 1 point per 5 skill points.<BR>Remember that monks have a strong will being able to negate damage at all.

</FONT><HR>Some nice ideas here.  Thanks for listening.<P>I like the idea also that has come up of our own damage tables for HtH.  Please makes fists better or at least on par with weapons, relate this with level.  I want a reason to use my fists!  Either that or give fists abilities over weapons depending on level maybe.<P>I also like the idea of natural AC progression with low weight; this helps the casual player a lot.  Not all of us have hours to get the uber armour or go on raids. I have a 53 monk and play 10 hours a week and still spot 3 bits of cured and a foreman’s tunic :-)  <P>For those at all levels wearing just say cured which has a low total weight this helps those who spend time on EQ without the agenda of loot.  High-level gear requires hours that casual players don't have and eventually casual players now after 1-2 years are getting high level chars.<P>With this we don't necessarily have to go out and get that better gear.  Yes the better armour will give you a better AC, but with this you are not so penalised for having less time to play EQ or spending your time on EQ in a non-acquiring loot way, which is a good thing for the monk class.<P><BR>On FD, you have made the changes because of abuse and this is a sensitive kind of area.  Would you mind opening up on VI issues with it?  Yes some encounters you have set-up are meant to be hard and were never intended to be FD split but maybe with all your designer issues and the players issues put out this community could find some neutral territory?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I know it is a little late in the game to make suggestions but unfortunately I was unable to do so when the original thread was running....<P>It seems to me that a Monk is a Martial Artist, that being the case why not make it so that once a Monk reaches a certain level at which it could be assumed that he has learned all of the basic martial arts skills, he could specialize in a specific discipline or style. Much like in real martial arts where you have Kick Boxers who do stun their opponents with certain (although difficult to land) attacks, or Aikido where you have mostly defensive training like locks (monk in party may be unable to attack until lock is broken but mob cant either) , or throws (interupt casters). Just a couple of thoughts, it may be a good way to implement some of the other suggestions...<P>Ginsudo Ueshiba<BR>20th Season Monk<BR>Seventh Hammer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok this is the first time for me to post here. I am a newbie both to the realm  of EQ itself and with my lv 27 iksar monk. Maybe the thougts of a midlevel not uber/nolife player are interesting to anyone? Or maybe not it's too late i already posted this =)<P>1) Monks are masters of UNARMED combat. This is true since nobody can do more damages than we do with their bare fists (besides Harm Touch =þ)<P>A warrior with a cheap (rusty dagger) weapon still outdamages me with all his fancy crippling blows, critical hits, ...<P>I wonder ... how are they supposed to know how to hit ANY enemy at crucial parts of their body (if any ... also wonder how to backstab a Wisp) using ANY type of weapon ANYTIME?<P>I mean ... we monks did train our fists only (feets don't count yet) for YEARS. We should know how and where to hit those MOBs a lot better than they do right now. A monk hitting a (insert some caster name here) for 4 blows in a round on the head should have a good chance to interrupt casters. Also nobody can tell me a warrior (can use his weapons (e.g. a 2hadend sword with the same precision that i could apply to my bare fists. Ever tried to use a sword? Ever even LIFTED one? Even with good and excessife  training a monk will for sure hit a lot more often, more precise and -by hitting critical areas- with additional effects.<P>Imagine a fight unarmed monk vs. a warrior using 2handed sword+heavy plate mail + .. + ... + ... (lots of AC items)<P>1st thing i would do would be to trip the warrior. No matter how many muscles you have you WILL trip, you WILL need time to get on your feet again. <P>Besides that ... i will NOT hit him on the chest where a big plate of metal will protect him. I stab his eyes, crush his nose, anything that CRIPPLES and SLOWS him down. I can't defeat him by hammering on his platemail. I need to defeat him using his weaknesses. I am talking CRITICALS here.<P>Let me hit the MOB (or player hehe) for really critical things. I want to blind him. I want to choke him. I want to cripple his hand wearing the weapon, ... you get the idea (hopefully, excuse my bad english)<P>Furthermore (to continue the monk-warrior duel)<BR>The warrior doesn't care that much if he gets hit since he got armor. And lots of it.<P>Monk doesn't want to get hit AT ALL. Never. HP + magic resistance is a joke already (even now while FD still works fine i die all the time ... damn casters), but in pure melee combat i am not supposed to be hit at all (in theory)<P>Maybe adding some additional defensive skill (like dodge, block, ...) will help. Right now i can't solo anything that con to blue to me.<P>Being blasted by a green caster also is no fun.<P>Summary<P>1) give us criticals<BR>2) give us multiple attacks<BR>3) stun, blind, ....<BR>4) defensive skill<BR>5) monk needs a natural way to increase resistances<P>(as seen on previous posts)<P>I hope this post wasn't 100% senseless. I was a little in a hurry too and as mentioned above my english isn't that good /me cries</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My 2cp...<P>More damage on fists at ALL LEVELS....make them faster too (or just make the delay really low to increase overall output--smaller damage dealt out faster for a net increase overall--but I prefer BOTH...lol!)...no way any weapon in a monks hand should be faster than his fists.  This dependency on 1HB to me ruins the whole class--if I wanted a dependency on weapons I would play my Warrior more.<P>Increase resists for spells--monks get murdered by casters because their resists suck...<P>Interrupt casting--specials should do this...nuff said...<P>Bonus AC for low weight--great idea, just make it worth while...<P>Throwing weapons--make stars lighter and have a longer range...they suck as it is and it makes sense to have them go father and do something other than weigh you down...eventually you give them up (as a newbie) as a waste of weight for no benefit.
