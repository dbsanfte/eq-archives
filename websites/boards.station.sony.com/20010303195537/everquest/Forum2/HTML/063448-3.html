True, a player could do that, but if the person they are reporting has a name that doesn't violate the rules, then they won't have anything to worry about really.  GMs can tell which names are against the rules and which names are not, just like you and I.  On the other hand, if the person being reported really does have a bad name, then the reporter is doing the right thing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Regarding the naming policy...<P>That is the most stupid and anal thing I've ever seen. Talk about take the fun out of the game. There is an incredibly small percentage of RPs hardcore enough to be bothered by idiomadic names or the like. So as far as that goes, you're improving the game for a very small percentage and ruining it for a large percentage. Kinda backwards thinking. Why restrict such a fun part of the game? I can't tell you how many times people have come up to me and complimented me on my name or joked about it or just had fun with it, much less how many times I have enjoyed others' names. I had the ability to remember others' names again because there name was a common spoken word, as opposed to something unpronouncable like Kzrzth. The vast majority of names aren't offensive but the vast majority of good names are "illegal." Who exactly would want a random and boring name like Oorek Dze`Crake. Who the heck would remember something like that or want to be named something with such a lack of creativity. BORING. This lack of freedom reminds me of grade school. Naming your character is important in the game because it gives you a sense of personal identity. You can be more easily remembered and it makes the game fun. Taking away this would definitely take a significant portion of fun and personality away from the game for a majority of the players. <P>Names can be stretched pretty far phonics-wise. If it's not impossible to police something like this fairly, it is definitely not anything as clear-cut as you make it out to be. I know I could come up with some pretty crude names that could be considered both "legal" and vastly "illegal" at the same time, because the english language can be stretched so far in prononciation. Are you going to police all languages? Are illegal words in English also illegal in other languages? If so don't you have to find them as well, and then ways you can represent those? Do you know Turkish? See the problem? Some people will have names which should be considered very "illegal" and others will have names that are borderline or not "illigal" and have their names changed. This is impossible to do fairly, so you shouldn't do it at all. <P>As a side note, a large portion of very high level charater names are what you deem to be illegal. Are you going to tell these players who have put hundreds or thousands of hours into a character (and hundreds of dollars respectively) who has become well known and liked by that name, that you're going to change their name because it doesn't fall in line with some overly restrictive policy? That of course would be rediculous. Let's just see how many of them are happy with that. Potentially you could overlook them preferentially, but then where is the justice and fairness in that, and where exactly do you draw the line? <P>As far as it goes, you, Verant do have the right to do something like this. I personally won't like the change, and I know a lot of other people won't either. Sure this policy could, in theory, make the environment more RPing friendly, but at what cost, and why? This type of freedom restriction is haunting, and something I want nothing to do with.<P>Nameless for fear of name change...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Something that's bothered me for a long while about naming policy:<P>Why force a name change or arbitrarily change a player's name at all?<P>If a GM has found a surname to violate policy would it not be seen to be fairer all round for the SURNAME to be reset to blank (as if surname had never been made)?<P>There could even be a second tier here, perhaps placing an asterisk or double asterisk after first name for players who have had surname removed for category 1 violation (eg vile, highly offensive, etc) set so that they can only make a new surname by petitioning a gm, in the same fashion that a name with a ' is done now.<P><BR>On the milder "violations" points I also have problems with the statement.<P>1) For example, it looks like "Faiza" would be read as "in violation" because it sounds like Phaser?  Hmmm, I happen to know a RL Fijian(Indian) lass who has that name IRL, and it has NO relation to the SF weapon apart from coincidence.<P>2) Similarly, while a name like "Merllin" might (might) be taken to be akin to "Merlin", the example of "Murrlin", while not a RL name afaik, sure reads sufficiently distinct to me.  I mean, ok, it may sound like "Merlin" when spoken aloud, but I don't see "Merlin" and all that is associated with that name by looking at "Murrlin" on the screen.<P>This kind of makes me wonder where the line is drawn on the #3-#13 violations?  <P>Is it a case of, someone who tries hard enough can warp their mouth enough to pronounce someone's name to sound like something that would seem to be in violation, so boomfar, name changed or worse?<P>3) Managirl Beachbum...hmmm, "mana", "girl", "beach", "bum"...the name in full fits policy fine, and of the base words that make up the descriptive compound words of the name the only one that could be said to definately be "non-fantasy" might be "bum".   So that last part is contemporary-ish.  Well, I suspect many equivalents from middle english might be less complimentary...though I guess an alternative might be worked out (eg "Managirl Beachvagabond"), but that would depend on the player being given TIME to think up an alternative!<P>(I imagine a name like "Managirl Beachvandal" would not be approved because of the contemporary meaning of "vandal" regardless of the origin being from the Vandal people...perhaps best known for sacking Rome.)<P><BR>On the subject of #1-#2 violations...well, I certainly approve of action taken to remove vile and highly offensive names, but I would not want a player permanently BANNED (and that's what deleting a high level player will basically amount to) over a "name".  <P>To my way of looking at it, it is the "name" that is the problem here, not the player necessarily.  If the player themselves is vile and offensive, that is a different matter.<P>Incidentally, if implemented, I can see the troll and ogre population halving in size overnight.  How many characters of these races DON'T have anatomical references as part of their names directly or in homonym form?<P>"Bignoze Smellydoze", "Doogooda Bashemgud", "Azwomp Stinkytroll" etc, etc, ad nausem.  Do we really want all these to vanish?  (Perhaps the examples here aren't the most appealing, but you all have seen similar names, some appealing, amusing, or disgusting yet regarded by many (most?) as fitting.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yes, I know.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>That example is stetching things to (if not beyond) the limit. (as I inferred, even if I didn't say it)<P>Although I suppose popular media is as subjective a term as 'offensive'.<P>Probalby only 3 people in the world ever saw it for all I know, but what happens if tommorow it becomes a cult hit, and then in a a few months years actually does become popular? (very unlikely I know  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> )<P>All I'm saying is that with the right motivation people can be vindictive enough to try anything. (and that with twisted enough logic almost any name can be made to seem, superficially at least, like it is against the rules)<BR>Now if that senario happend 1000 times and 999 times the GM was sensible, then all is well and good.  But if the 1000 time the GM wasn't so sensible or having a bad day or had just been annoyed by a player...<P>I'm sure there are enough people out there with the "If you don't do what *I* want, I'm telling teacher" mentality to make it a valid concern.<P>Maybe not, perhaps I have too little faith in human nature.  But these sort of posts do make me vaguely worry that one day someone will tell me Fopoode is offensive in Russian, or worse (as is now suggested) they might tell the GM's and they delete it with out my knowledge.  After all something you have put days or real time into (even if it is 'just a game')is not something I'd wish to see go up in smoke for something I didn't realise.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Nowadays I see ppl running around with these names:<BR>-Iluvtreez<BR>-Iama Treehugger<BR>-Tuscony Texas (or some other city that IS actually in Texas, escapes me at the moment)<BR>-Clarity (yes, an enchanter)<BR>-Anchanting<BR>-Breeze (or was it Breezy?)<P>I mean, we're talking, car lovers....blatant phrases...Verant wasn't even looking, LOL...my friend managed the name: Glazd Dohnut !!! LOL<P>I'm GLAD Verant is cracking down...too many dumb names out there.<P>Krytal &lt;--- I don't think a "Krytal" exists in the real world.<BR> <BR>-------------------------------------<P>The rule is all subjective, and that's why I mainly disagree with it.<P>"Oldrak" can be viewed as offensive. Like maybe to someone, it means an old woman's breasts.<P>Or "Krytal" can be viewed as a variation on the fast-food restaurant, "Krystal". Or heck, suppose your full name was "Krytal Hoomies" which could be a valid name. But someone could view it as a variation of "Cry, Tall Hummies".<P>When the law/rule is subjective to the whole community, then you can find faults in almost anything. There's a lot more problems in the game, and people quitting/getting frustrated over, than just a simple name.<P>I agree, some are offensive, and need to be changed : "Hitler", "Bigdiddies", etc etc... but what the heck does it hurt you or the game if someone is named "Smashor Grumblebelly" ? <P>And it's been my experience for 2 years, and over 150 levels in 4 main characters that the ones with the colorful or imaginative names are usually the funnest to roleplay with, and to enjoy the game with.

</FONT><HR>After seeing the producer's letter on improved customer relations and also reading the re-phrasing naming policy, I had some questions and concerns.<P>The first place I looked for someone to reply to was .. the bottom of the letter.  I expected a link to Mr. George Scotto's email address, or even a statement of it if a hyperlink is too much to ask.  Not seeing one, I checked the bottom of the naming policy for a contact address for queries or concerns (i.e. naming@everquest.com).<BR>None was present.<P>Thinking "This is interesting ... ", I examine the sidebar for a "feedback" link and spot "Contact Us".  Instead I get the Everquest FAQ page and think I misclicked.  before going back to try again, however, I check to see if my question is mentioned in the FAQ - it wasn't.<P>So I go back and click on "Contact us" again, only to get the FAQ again.  "Hmm, okay - they want people to check the FAQ before sending in questions, makes some sense" - Then I spot the line at the top of the FAQ "The questions on the FAQ either come from email, us, or the newsgroups. The answers come from the EverQuest team. If you would like your own questions answered, please visit the Contact Us page.<BR>" (where this "Contact Us" is another link)<P>Aha! Another contact us link. Yet when I clicked on the link yesterday, and still today, I get IE's lovely default "The page cannot be found." message.<P>Isn't better customer service (as mentioned in the Producer's Letter) great?<P>Cheers,<BR>  Gygar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This should be a lot of fun to watch.<P>It will please me to no end that the "Ashkatchum"s of Norrath will be repressed, at least for a bit.<P>On the other hand, there is a significant amount of subjectivity in the rules.  My dorf has a high-fantasy first name (so I'm safe there), and my handle as a last name.  I think that "Beerquaffer" is pretty in-tune with a fantasy dwarf, but it’ll be interesting to see if it survives the inquisition.<P>As for the folks shuddering over the "auto-deletions", I doubt there will be too many gray areas there.  Anyone remember the guy who got the name "Nigor" out of the game's generator and then whined on the boards that he was banned?  Lots of support for the guy until it was revealed that a buddy had created "Whity" and the two were spamming the server with dueling results.<P>I will admit, however, that the example in policy notice has me a bit worried.  I had to look at "Hugeaz" for a few seconds before I could figure out what was allegedly offensive about it.<P>Ah well, the new "My Name was Changed and I'm Gonna Quit" threads should be a blast to read; I'm really looking forward to it.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Aerna has been alive and well on many servers, in many forms and since beta 2, the name chosen by moi.<BR>As for this nameing policy, I have always liked it.  Of course, I've always been confused as to why a few names I've tried never made it through (and names with three letters, that should change imho), when people have names such as snugglebunnies, Lewtdrood, et all, which in all honesty, do move foward to destroying any (and there's little to find now) Roleplaying from the environment.<BR>As for comparing, a naming policy to Nazism, and communism, thats just plain wrong, rude and EXTREMELY distasteful.  There's a thousand better ways to compare a naming policy to something else, but to compare it to Nazi's is disgusting and unnecessary.<P>Aerna Silverthorne &lt;Brell&gt;<BR>Aerna Ru'earthtae &lt;Fennin Ro&gt;<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Okay, here's my take.<P>Deleting for violation of category #1.  How can you not see this is beneficial?  Look, if someone is going to name themselves something that is "Vile, profane, rude, or racist names including common swear words, anatomical references, racial slurs, and homonyms of these words", can you understand why it wouldn't be desirable for them to profit from their efforts under that name?  If someone made a name "Killalljews", I would damn sure want to see that character VAPORIZED.  Heck, I think category #1 is deserving of account deletion, they're being generous!<P>Category #2 should be reviewed by a panel of GMs.  Offensive is highly subjective... mind you, some names are less subjective than others.  I don't care if your real life name IS Richard and you ARE 6' 9", Big&lt;Bleep&gt; is not an acceptable name, and anyone with double-digit years under their belt knows this.<P>#3, this is also a no-brainer.  If your only contribution to the game is calling yourself Nappoleun Boneappartt, then you need a spanking with the clue paddle.<P>#4, come on.  This is too simple.  If you call yourself Mownten Doo, you can bet Pepsi wouldn't be too happy about trademark infringement should they find out.  And if Pepsi isn't happy, Pepsi's lawyers aren't happy, and if Pepsi's lawyers aren't happy, then Verant's lawyers start ordering Rolaids by the case.<P>#5.  Even if you don't agree that names should be SLIGHTLY original, then only because a world populated by copycat names is going to get annoying, fast.  That guy in your group named Ahnuld Shwarzenegger may not seem so bad, but just imagine the fiftieth time that night he goes out to pull, every single time sending to group "I'll be back".  Puke.  <P>#6.  If you HAVE to name your Warrior "Bazuka", then maybe EQ isn't the game for you. Quake would have no trouble with that.<P>#7.  Yes, you may think it's cute to name your High Elf maiden Feerioana Vee, but I'm sure the elves on your server named Fieriowna Vea, Feareeona Vie, Fereiowna V, and Feeriona Veeeee all think it's really dumb.<P>#8/9.  Making a Troll named Abbashi and KSing everyone in sight in an attempt to discredit the real guy is bad, mmkay?  Tell your buddy Absoar that too.<P>#10.  Calling yourself Kinglouis Thefourteenth may sound really cool, but it's not.  Trust us.<P>#11.  Your Wood Elf named Lukatmybunz may be cute to you, but it jerks us out of the game quicker than a server crash.<P>#12.  Your Barbarian named Conann may be cute to you, but we've seen the name about 50 times today alone.  That goes for Rastelinn, Aragoarn, and Billbow too.<P>#13.  Look, simple enough... these are supposed to be names, not chat handles.  If you know anyone actually NAMED Ratts Beehinde, I'd like to know how they made it through gradeschool without taking a 30-06 to the playground one day.<P>As to the whole "I know somebody in real life named that!' arguement... I know someone whose last name is Hood.  They actually named their kid Robin.  They guy's name is, no joke, Robin Hood.  That's innappropriate for EQ, but real life has no naming policy.<P>Of course, Verant doesn't own Real Life, either.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Er, pardon me, but how can anyone (VI or Player) ever mention this game in the same sentence and context with the word: 'role-play' ??? Since WHEN has EQ become a RPG? Maybe it happened during the most recent 'emergency maintenance' downtime.<P>While I generally tend to agree with the removal or alteration of idiotic names (Chuggly Wuggly comes to mind) I'm going to flatly disagree, even vehmently disagree with this 'new policy'.<P>Anyway, that was an aside. My primary point is 'hypocrasy runs rampant'. Verant, if you're going to enforce this policy on us, then you had better go through all of your 'cute, corny' NPC names and alter them as well. Many are clearly referencing real people or groups.<P>My secondary point is: don't you have anything better to do? Stupid player names isn't what nullifies role-playing in this game. YOUR mis-comprehension of role-playing is the problem. You have no theme or story to your campaign world! You have no logical rationale for ANY of the Classes you fabricated (or if you do, you refuse to let us read it). We players are not role-playing because you didn't design a role-playing game. On the one hand (as an example) you demand we have 'role-playing names' yet at the same time, you conduct Best of the Best or Champion contests which completely violate any possibility of role-playing whatsoever.<P>So why are you NOW, suddenly, concerned with a 'role-playing environment'?<P>Someone PLEASE explain this to me cause one of us has got to have some relief!<P>Alc</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>LOL, that is pretty funny considering how they currently treat CS.  Let's see, we're group gating out of the 6th floor of the Frozen tower after killing VherSera and everyone makes a mystical portal, not one person should have been left behind.  However one person zone crashes and ends up, where?  Oh yeah, right back where VherSera spawns.   Good thing we had cleared the area, because the GM online refused to port him out.  LDs aren't their issue, even though this person did make a mystical portal before going LD.   Oh well, we'll have to see what they do.  Knowing their track record, might be more of a joke than anything else.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Verant's Naming policy should ONLY be there to curb offensive names PERIOD. Have you seen the stupid naming policy page on this site? It’s utterly ridiculous. It reads more specific and complicated than my friggin apartment lease. What a disgrace.<BR> <BR>Some of the name changings that the GMs have pulled are so shameful, arbitrary and inconsistent it’s sickening. I had a good friend who had his FIRST name changed at 54 because some lamer /petitioned him and said it was in some fantasy novel. This crap needs to stop and it needs to stop NOW.<P>The policy is so specific that you CANNOT have a creative name whatsoever. Verant doesn’t like people with creative names, they want your name to be unidentifiable and consist of only consonants. Anyone that is able to make a creative name that manages to get past the Gestapo GMs and their Caesar like whims, will eventually get petitioned by a player in retaliation for some previous grievance as revenge. <P>Since any name that doesn’t violate the rules is either pure consonants, taken by someone else or borderline as to be the subject of interpretation by a staff that repeatedly makes horrible and grievously poor decisions, most likely will be changed. Furthermore, it will be changed with no manner of appeals, audits, or committee review whatsoever.<P>As you can see you have a customer service department that is notorious for grossly mishandling the most common of situations, creating a hostile atmosphere for the players in which a name with no obscenities is changed on a whim despite the destruction of a long career and well build reputation.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor -<P>The letter has an error in it which you need to fix.  When explaining what will be done in the case of certain categories of offense, it lists what will be done for category 1-2 offenses, and for category 3-10 offenses.  You added some categories, though, so you have 13 categories, and this letter doesn't say what will be done for 11-13 category offenses.

</FONT><HR>Ahh, crap you have discovered their escape clause.  You see they were going to use those other 3 categories as catch-alls.  It is not public notice, but for category 11 through 13 Verant has decided you will spin their new "Wheel of Fate."  The wheel has punishments randomly placed on it.  For instance:  If found in violation of any of these "undefined" categories you may win such privileges as<P>1.  Random Character deletion:  Verant will just pick any of your characters and hit the delete button.<P>2.  Random Character nerf:  A favorite of Verant.  In this punishment they will look at your character and take away one vital action enjoyed by the character.  Perhaps your enchanter will no longer be able to mez, or your druid will no longer be able to cast sow.  Warriors will no longer be able to duel wield.  Necromancers will no longer be...uh...hmm.... appears they have already taken everything away from them...<P>These are just a few examples of what can happen you you if found in violation of rules 11-13<P>The trick is that Verant also has a mystery rule, rule number 14.  Nobody knows what it is, but if your character's name violates it, Verant has the legal right to come to your hometown and burn your house down.  (sorry its in the agreement you signed)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It sounds like Verant is making an honest effort here, to clarify both what they expect of the players, and what the players can expect of them.  That's obviously a good thing, and I take it as an encouraging sign.<P>I am of course, like everyone else, slightly hung up on the concept of deleting characters for what are considered to be serious name violations.  It's not clear to me why it's necessary to be so confrontational about it.  Possibly the thinking is that people will say "hey, if the worst that can happen is they'll change my name when they catch me, why not go for it?", so they feel there needs to be more of a penalty. <P>That's understandable enough.  But no matter how smart you are, or how much you're certain that something is obvious - it is possible to be wrong.  Verant has been wrong before, when they were absolutely certain that they were right initially - everyone is.  The point is, you aren't always going to be right - put in some safeguards for times when you're wrong.<P>Another point about names - a lot of people come here from other games, where the kind of names that are unacceptable in EQ are not only perfectly acceptable, they're almost de rigeur.  When you first load up and start Everquest, you don't know anything about the game, or conventions, you've never seen the message board, or the last 2 years of name discussions, and you maybe use, in totally good faith, the name you've used for the last couple of years in quake or tribes or UT.  By the time you DO figure it out, policy says you aren't allowed to change it (if you petition yourself).  A little understanding may be in order here, rather than immediately scaring newcomers off the game by deleting their characters.  <P>And yes, I'm sure it's in the user agreement, and if everyone at Verant who ever loads a new piece of software on their PC sits down and peruses the license agreement in detail before they run the program fine, but honestly, you have to expect people to be human and treat them the way you'd want to be treated yourself.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063448-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063448.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063448-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063448-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=063448&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=063448&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
