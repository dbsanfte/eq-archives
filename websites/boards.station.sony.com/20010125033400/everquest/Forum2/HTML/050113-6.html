</FONT><HR>I am not a magician.<P>I like the idea of summoned Bard instrments and a nice bag of summoned leather or a robe would be nice for the naked, but would also like to add Shurikens for the Monk pullers.<P>Most of these ideas doesn't help the Magician themselves.  For the Magician trying to join a group deep in a dungeon, how about a self summoning spell that takes them where their targeted group member is?  That would allow the group leader to gate out, invite the Magician and the Magician summons themselves to the group, then summon the group leader back to the group.  I realize this is a potentially exploitable ability, but I can't see how this is different than gating which is a lower level spell and easier to cast.  Make it slow casting and high mana cost to help offset any exploit potential.  This would help Magicians to get groups, which is the idea I think.<P>Clerics getting a summoned bandage spell?  It would step on Magicians' toes.  It isn't as if I want to spend my time summoning them as soon as I get online either.  Please do NOT give Clerics this EVER.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, ideas for new magician summoning:<BR>I read once that everquest is based on a lot of RPG games and the card game M:TG (can't help but notice the similarities of the ice age expansion set and SoV) so I took a look through my old cards and came to the conclusion that magicians are loosely based on the artifact cards so with that in mind here are some of my ideas (plus some of the good ones I've read)<P>*I really like the summon armour idea, make it  like the pouch spells now so you can hand somone  a bag with just 4 major pieces of armour (bp,  legs,arms whatever) this may not be usefull for  planes CR but not all of us are planes capable.<BR>*Some new decent weapons, maybe just weapons for  our pets.  But make them along the elemental  lines-spear of ice w/ Water pet DD 1hb w/ earth  pet like spell and so on<BR>*A lot of M:tG cards are along the lines of  sacrafice X to gain X/X so a spell that you get  at say lvl 20 and use a regent and the more rare  or expensive the regent the better the item   summoned that you can give/sell to other ppl that  they then r-click(sacrafice) on to give them  hp/ac boosts   until camping or death<BR>*ok maybe this isn't exactly new but a simple  renaming of the higher lvl pets spells w/ new  skins would be nice i.e. summon: Golem for earth,  Fire golem for (duh) fire and what not.<BR>*To improve class interaction how about magicians  summon some form of container with a combine  button and have the other pure caster each be  able to summon a different item that when each is  put in the container and combined it creates  something good for mana regen or a one time full  mana recharge (powerfull I know but it would be  nice along the lines of Urzas  mine/powerplant/tower for those that know what  I'm ranting about  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/redface.gif">)<BR>*A sword or other weapon that stops regen/healing  would be very nice but maybe not so balancing<BR>*More rings would be nice, like a 1 charge regen  (just like the druid spell, or maybe less for  balance issues) for when those pesky clerics  aren't in your group<BR>*Some spells that are r-clickable that give some  stats boosts but do have a time limit like buffs  but making items instead so in raids you can  summon everyone the buff the want and still have  time to med for when the mayhem starts and  everyone can activate the items when they need  them-buff in a bottle so to type<BR>(can you tell I'm big into the r-click/sacrafice thing)<BR>*Anything, and I mean anything that helps our pets</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Its annoying to sit and stare at the buff from a necro or enchanter etc, which you CANNOT remove by left clicking, when you want to slap your regen armor on.

</FONT><HR>Hummm, let's see...<P>Ring of Invis: Use the icon for a gold ring.  You can't say that such a ring has no place in a fantasy game/setting like this.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P>Ring of Flight: Can we have the level lowered a bit on this, please?<P>Summon Rod/Summon Bait: to make down time more fun.  We can all sit around, fish, and talk about how we once summoned a pet *this* big!<P>Summon Ale: A lower to mid range spell.  It gives us something to drink while fishing.<P>Summon Spit/Summon Sweing Kit/ect: You might want to make them No Drop, but it's a great way to use summonings to help with some trade skills, without really adding to our power.<P>Summon Chainmail: Several summons for various bits of All/All chain armor.  You might want to make it an odd color, and stats befiting a mid-level summons/buff.  Maybe make it for the visible parts of the armor only?<P>Summon Crystal Chainmail: High level upgrade to the chainmail spells.<P>Summon Robe of the Gatecaller: No Drop robe that has stats slightly worse than the Robe of Elements.  If possable, use the Robe of Elements look, but change the colors (bronze and teal would be noteworthy).<P>Summon Cadamus: I think I misspelled it, but it's the staff that Mercury (the god) carried, that became a symbol for doctors/healers.  Have it 1hb, and carry a charge or 2 of a pet healing spell.<P>Other summoned weapons: it would be nice to have a range of different weapon types (axes, scythes, maces, ect) to choose from.  Also, is it possable to have them proc against more "unusual" groups/types of monsters (Gnolls, Froglocs, big cats, ect)?  I would love to be able to summon a Scythe of Gnoll Slaying, a Frogloc Hunting Spear, or a Treent Bane Axe.<P>Summon Bindstone: Yah, I think we need one.  Make it level 30ish.  That way, they have a better chance of finding a lower level caster to bind them, but this option still exists.  As summoned items count as someone else casting a spell on you, it will automatically restricted to the normal areas for binding others.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oh yah, almost forgot.  On the subject of a spell that summons a runaway MOB to you, I think that could be abused too easily.  However, if you combine that with the idea of some kind of resistance to *being* summoned, you get this:<P>A self only buff, that only takes effect if something tries to summon you.  When this happens, the summoning backfires, and the MOB pulls itself to YOU (and your group), instead of the other way around.  Risky, but it could be interesting...<BR>(mind you, I'm not really high level, so I don't know for sure what kind of chaos that spell could cause)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1. Summon Guardian:  Level 24.  Cast when targeted on a party member.  Summons a lvl 12 enchanter pet that is linked to the targeted party member.  Since it is a chanter pet, the party member cannot control the pet in any way, it just hovers near them and protects them.  Wouldn't be very helpful to the tanks, since it's so low in comparative level and would die quick, but would be a help to the casters in the party, watching over them while they med.  Could have upgrades at 36th and 49th levels.<P>2.  Summon Cloak of protection.  Beginning at level 12 with upgrades at every other spell rank after that.  summons a lore norent cloak, all/all, ac=one-quarter the caster's level, with always-up damage shield, damage=one-sixth the caster's level, stacks with all other damage shields.  Nice item to hand out to party members, not unbalancing, as many will already have cloaks that are better.  Also good to give out for CR.<P>3. Summon Pet.  Level 16.

</FONT><HR>Summon pit: creates a pit under the targeted mab that the mob can not escape.  No one can attak or otherwise effect the mob in the peit and the pit pasts for a set amount of time.  The time can get longer in upgrades to the spell and a spike pit can be introduced at higher levels to case damage to the mob in the pit.<P>Summon Chains: The mob is wrapped in chains and restrained for a set amount of time, time can increase with upgrades and Summmon Choking chains couls cause damage at higher levels.<P>These of course are root-like spells and as such they would have to have fast casting times to be of any use.  In the past Verant did not want to give mages root spells because of "cahin casting pets"  If a mage had root then it would be easy to root a mob, make a new pet and then hand it weapons.  But now we have pets that automatically dual weild so that is not an issue, chain casting is very simple.  The only thing a root-type spell does is give us an escape option like all the other classes have  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>a few ideas.<P>a whole range of weapons. Covering all types up through level 60. They dont need to be good enough that people would use them over weapons they would already have, but be good enough to be semi effecive at the given level. These could be used to twink newbies sort of, but we need them for doing CRs where we can fight the way back to the corpses. Just give the melees the type of weapon they normaly use and go do some ass kicking.<P>And along those same lines, the ability to summon armor. The best way would be to make the AC on it level dependent, so maybe one spell for each peice(or a few peices) where thier AC is based on the level of the caster. Once again not having it so good as to be better than the armor they would be wearing at said level. So for example maybe at level 60 you could summon armor the equiv of planar armor(ac only, no stats) and at level 50 maybe get the equiv of class armors. Could have one spell for plate classes and another version of it for chain.<P><BR>A few other things, probably out of the question.<P>  A summon mob spell that would bring a targeted mob in the zone to the mage, have it with a high taunt effect to make it hard for the group to get it off the mage after use, or give it a component cost... or both.<BR>A pet spell that doesnt take a component, once again to help with CRs. Just have it a weaker version of the pets from that same level range or maybe have it with the stats of a pet from the lower level spell without any special effects.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>/em scratches his chin and leans back<P>1.  I would love to be able to summon a mob.  I have been summoned a couple times by badies when I smacked them a good one, just seems like something a magician should be able to do.<P>2.  I would also love to be able to recall a wayward pet that has gotten caught up in some bad pathing.  I truely hate to see "taunting attacker master" and have no clue as to what/where/how many will soon be coming to add pp to the nearest clerics coffers.<P>3.  How about a weapon/rod/staff that has a few charges of some updated pet healing spell?  Or apply the retrive lost pet effect to one of the items. <P>4.  My fondest wish would be to summon a tentical whip that procs life tap, NORENT would be just fine.  <P>I have read an awful lot of requests to summon armor but I got to say that after playing a magician for the last 18 plus months this would be such a hassle.  Log in for the day, summon your food/water/pet, buff the pet then begin to summon armor.  What as many as five six maybe even seven peices.  Wasn't there a major thread just last week concerning down time?  I want nothing to do with summoning my wears and I am certain that your awaiting group wouldn't either if you went LD in enemy territory.<P>Oh none of this will come to be anyway right?<P>"This does NOT mean that I am promising that you will see new summoned items in the game! We are just fishing for ideas here, not promising any sort of new stuff. In fact, maybe you should just ASSUME you’ll never see any of this stuff, just to make it easier on everyone’s already over-stressed hearts.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">"<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Proc could be something akin to a velium weapon, with a tiny dd.

</FONT><HR> Id like to see maybe a jboots type summons heck we get levitation ring make it have the jboots effect (which is slower than sow) and have like 1 or 2 charges like the ring does. We wont be infringing on any class because everyone knows sow is better and it will cut down on the cyclops camping cause now you will have mages that have no need of these and this will answer our prayers for escape and for being more travel and group friendly (sow runs out on group member in the middle of the pull clicks on item and speeds up gets back to the group healthier or if no druid or shaman available is a decent replacement spell.) Call it Ring of the journeyman and make it a really high mana summons like the mod rod and has to be worn on finger for effect so people will have to do inventory changes to do it. Make it high level like 49 and that takes care of our missing 49 summons.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A line of new weapons that can ONLY be wielded by pets, kinda like how the muzzle can only be used by pets.  I can think of 4 different swords in this line that would be nice but they should probably all be 51+ summons.  Ask any mage over 51 and they'll tell you that out pets get signifcantly weaker COMPARED to the progression of the other classes' power and RELATED to the difficulty and amount of hitpoints that all the mobs you'll be fighting in the higher levels have.  If you don't want to make our pets progress like they did in the pre 50 levels to keep up with the mobs and other classes then at least you could give us some summons that would spice up the diversity of the pets in these levels.<P>Basically they would be pet only wieldable weapons with different utility procs on them.  Here are my four suggestions.<P>1)  A sword that procs a self damage shield.  Probably lava shield but if you wanted to make it a level 57 summon then go ahead and make it cadeau of flame.  This is in no way overpowering since the mage can already cast this on his pet.  Just saves some mana and some hassel.  And since it's a proc it's not like it's even very reliable.<P>2)  I was first thinking of a snare sword but that would be a bit too powerful so i think it would be better to use the weakest version of snare out there.  I'm no expert on the different snare spells but the lowest level necro darkness spell would be a good contender.  Very weak movement slow down rate and a small amount of damage but still better than nothing.<P>3)  A slow proc.  Pure and simple.  A weak slow, not to be anywhere near equal to shaman or enchanter slow but maybe 15-20%.  Just so that the mage can throw the group a bone in the event that it doesn't have a real slower.<P>4)  A weak level tashan spell.  Maybe one that does -20 to all resists.  This would also be nice as a taunt spell.<P>At first glace this might seem like a bit much but let me add this.  First of all, these are procs which if you haven't noticed don't go off too often in the hands of a pet anymore since that fix.  Second, they in no way step on the toes of any other classes since they are extremely obsolete to the spells that are currently used by those classes at those levels.(simply adding a pinch of utility to mage pets incase your group is lacking one of these functions but in no way shape or form a substitute for them)  And third, something has really got to be done about our 51+ pets.  No, really, something has got to be done.  Our pets become powerful at level 49 following a fairly consistant rate of advancement but then in the final 10 levels of the game, the 10 hardest levels of the game, they are simply given a few more levels.  Meanwhile melee classes are getting weapons that let them hit for 2 and 3 times what they could before kunark came out and we're fighting mobs that 200% and 300% harder than the ones we were fighting at level 49 while our pets get about a 10-15% boost in power.  If the mobs i'm fighting have about 4 or 5 times the amount of hitpoints as the ones i was fighting at level 49 then why should my pets only have about 5% more hitpoints than the ones i summoned at level 49?  If you check it out you'll find my numbers are pretty acurate.<P>Like i said, i don't care if you don't want to buff our 51+ pets to a respectable level but at least give them a whole new angle while keeping with the theme of the class.<P>(PS - 54 water pet excluded from rant about pets but should still have more hitpoints)<P>-Thank you  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>BTW, when i said that they in no way step on the toes of the other classes i should have that they don't do so any more than a monk being able to right click a level 55 mage spell and summon throwing stars or a bard, cleric, and shaman being about to summon food and water or a ranger being about to right click himself some arrows, or anybody in the world being able to summon bandages with that dagger etc, etc......   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>And seriously, please check out the progression of those pets.  Compare the difference of the level 39, 44, and 49 pets to the difference of the 49, low 50's, and high 50's pets.<P>If i had to rate the pets' power between 1 and 100 in those levels it would be something like this:<P>39 pets         *40 power<BR>44 pets         *65 power<BR>49 pets         *95 power<BR>low 50's pets   *97 power<BR>high 50's pets  *100 power<P>There's something seriously wrong with that power curve.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
