Fear is CHA based and as a dwarf cleric I rarely have my fears of low blue mobs last longer than 3 seconds if that long.

This nerf does not really effect low level clerics and I am one that is not really effected directly, but I am bright enough to see the writing on the wall.  Anyone that wants to tell me clerics should just adapt, adjust, and cope should just play a cleric to level 30 and tell me how easy it it.<P>I mean if clerics are so "Uber" it should be easy for all of you to build a cleric twink to 29 so you can save yourself CRs.

</FONT><HR>Absor, this is just sad.  You've stated that the change was made because clerics were bored with the old heal/med routine.  So I guess this change was to benefit them, to make things more fun?  lol... you've got to be kidding.  It's been made abundantly clear that the majority of clerics HATE the change, as do many other players.  Clerics would love some variety in what they do.  Dying many times more often in 51+ encounters is NOT what they had in mind for variety.  Who said CH was broken?  Bah... you'd tuned the whole high level/uber mob game around CH being used and used frequently.  Then you decide that CH is broken. Huh? *boggles at Verant, shaking his head and looking confused*  <P>There was some goal of reducing the dependency on one class.  That has failed.  Now you just need MORE healers than you did before.  You still want a cleric if possible so you can rez, it's just that a backup healer is practically required now too.  Also, enchanters are even MORE of a requirement than they were before.  So much for that goal.  So there we have it.  <P>Goal 1: reduce dependency on one particular class: Failed.<P>Goal 2: Relieve the monotony of being a cleric, making the game more fun for high level clerics:  Failed (unless you equate "Loading, please wait..." with fun).<P>To have any realistic chance of dealing with this change successfully, ALL high level encounters will have to be retuned along with tank taunting abilities increased.  Even if uber mobs are retuned, clerics have still been screwed over.  Their claims to fame are rezzing and complete heal.  Now they can't CH hardly at all during big battles without dying.  Other good heals can be cast by druids/shamans.  So play a druid or shaman.  Log in clerics when someone needs rezzed.<P>Before some clerics just felt like a portable medkit.  Well no longer clerics of Norrath!  Now you get to just be a portable rez kit!  woohoo!<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>For me the new heal changes have totally taken the fun out of grouping with my Druid. Why would I want to spend 80% of my playtime in a group meditating only to stand up and have whatever we are killing beat me senseless ?? I'll stick to root-kiting thanks.<P>I helped a few friends out last night by casting Greater Healing on them when the (lvl 20ish) MOB was down to about 20% health and it jumped all over me.

</FONT><HR>I must say that Absor is much better at spinning then Abashi was by a long shot.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>This statement really caught my eye though:<P>"I know that many people don't like to hear me say this, but it's the truth. Healing aggro was broken. We need to fix it to make the game right. I hold to the truth that a game isn't good for anyone if the mechanics aren't right."<P>I'm glad you hold to that truth sir and I can but hope that the rest of the team holds to it as well cause there's a lot of mechanic issues that have been ignored since release in EQ.  Pathing being one of the major ones that comes to mind.  Now with that statement I'm positive you're all going to put your little heads together and fix them ALL yes?  But I pray when you do it you actually do a thorough test and determine exactly how the fixes will affect all aspects of the game and take those into consideration cause you failed miserable at doing that on this 'fix'.<P>And honestly sometimes you have to step back and weight the good with the bad then determine if it really needs to be fixed or can you work with what you have and still achieve the same results.  It seems that since release you felt the problem could be worked around because you left it alone AND coded new content around it.  So honestly did it really NEED to be fixed?  <P>And if for some odd reason you say it was a necessity then wouldn't it have made much better sense from a business/customer relations standpoint to discuss it with your customers first especially seeing how much of a change it would make in gameplay/style for the highend encounters?  <P>And if you tell me you didn't foresee those changes then I'll tell you that you just didn't test it thoroughly enough and through all levels of gameplay.<P>But why should you test it?  You've got all the live servers to test it for you... <P>an_LTM_00: "Come on you clerics and tanks!  Die some more out there we don't have enough test data!! Oh and throw a couple casters and a hybrid or two on the dead pile while you're at it!"<P>an_LTM_01: "And where's that log from FoH's last raid?  How'd they take Dain down again?  Geez we gotta put a stop to that one!  Abashi!!!  Get over here!"<P>Shear genius or incredible stupid?

I have no desire to play anymore when I just die 20 times each time we try and kill something.  Since the patch I’ve lost over a bubble of exp in 60 with 56s resses each time.

What a joke. As a druid, my worst crime, you claim is that I can solo. Well you know what, you learn a heck of a lot when you have to solo. You learn how to react to a situation and how to use every spell at your disposal.<P>Well, refute me, she said she was in an outdoor area, why didn't the rogue INSTILL DOUBT? Well? What was more important, survivng the battle or standing there like a N00B and dying so she could whine on this message board. I might be controversial and contentious but in this situation, I have a point.<P>&gt;&gt;Also you say root the mob, sow to run etc. Lol, there are many things you can do. <P>Yes there ARE MANY THINGS YOU CAN DO - that's the difference between a good player and a bad player. The patch didn't cause her to die, her lack of quick thinking or having been carried by the non functioning CH for too long caused her to die.<P>&gt;&gt;MObs resist root (root resist killed me in Karnors the other night), mobs debuff you. <P>Root, Fear, stun, RUN! Couldn't root it, run. You say mobs resist root like it's a given, there is a similar chance that it won't resist. <BR>She could have told her husband to fear it. <P>Clerics also get FLASH OF LIGHT. Flash it and step the hell back and watch it run off. Do what it takes to live, or die. MOB magic resistance exist for all of US (quad kiting, one resist can be the difference between exp or zoning) - learn to live with it like every other caster has had to.<P>&gt;&gt;I dont know Kat personally, but I know from her reputation that she is a very experienced player, as are most of players that get past 50, you do learn a few tricks and you do use them. <P>Rubbish, go to Karnors and the VERY first thing you'll learn is how clueless a lot of post 50 players are. Train after Train after Train after Train. A lot of people, and especially clerics get carried by their group.<P>med, heal, med, heal, med, heal ad infinatum - Clerics, it's not enough to be a trained monkey anymore. <P>Ub3R encounters, I'll get back to you, fighting an Orc in Vellious. No excuse.<P>One more time, for Kat - it's called agro kiting, learn how to use it!

I'm one of the few clerics that figured out how to solo high lvl stuff with that stupid PET (not telling how are they will do another nerf ... involves edge effects on terrain to the kernel engine in cunjuction with fear).  That took me eons to figure out and many deaths ... and this change makes trying to figure out how to solo with the pet seem trivial ... and even if i didn't figure it out ... what i would do IS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A GAME ENGINE ERROR ... which is fun i guess but totally messes up role playing.<P>... I've figured out area cleric nuking ... and undead soloing ... Like many other competent posters here ... and this change is just pure crap!

</FONT><HR>I've been killing in Karnor's Castle for a while now(I'm level 50 now) and I've noticed that clerics are dying often and that trains have increased since with no cleric/healer the group is dead. I liked how things were before when I could CH someone without the worry of being killed. CH was fine the way it was, maybe it need a LITTLE more argo affect. As it stands now I'm play my monk more than my cleric. Why? What's the point of leveling up to kill in higher level areas just to get killed and spend all my mana on rezzing people? <P>Fix Complete Heal, Give Clerics a better version Complete Heal around level 55(7 cast time or so) since druids and shamans have all of our heals other than Complete Heal. Maybe even after you give us a better CH throw us a bone and give us invis at 39.<P>I'm not going to quit playing EQ after all this time, but I will(along with others) continue to complain about the nerf on Clerics as long as I'm paying to be a beta tester I mise well give some feedback.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The following question was asked on another EQ message board.  I thought i would post my reply to it since it pretty much sums up my feelings on this whole issue.<P>&gt;&gt;Do you think that having to rework strategies constantly is something which should be expected in an MMORPG, or is changing world dynamics of critical importance something which should not be altered after an MMORPG goes live?&lt;&lt;<P>As far as this question goes there can be a lot of answers.  VI has alway said this game would have "a changing and evolving world" I think that when I read "a changing and evolving world"  I think of a world that actually changes.  By this I mean that Qeynos is over-run by corrupt guards, cabilis is rebuild, empires fall and rise...ect.  <P>What verrant interpitation seems to be a world where the characters change.  They get smarter, stronger, and so forth.  To me this kind of change offers challenge, but is not nessisarly as fun.  <P>I would love to go to qeynos after beeing away for months to find that it is run by the plague bringers.  Or go to Kunark and find the iksar have rebuild some more of there lost empire.  This to me would be fun and offer adventure to the game.  The changes they make, though they offer a challenge, may seem fun to some.  But to most they seem frustrating.<P>One thing that VI has a problem of doing, not that i am all that frustrated with them, is they seem to change the game into a game THEY would love to play, more than ther CUSTOMER would.  I think when VI does those polls when you log in, is a great thing.  It gives them and idea of what there customer whants, and that is more important than what they want.<P>My opinion on the Healing agro, is that it has been broken so long that they should of left it that way.  The game has been out for two years+ and most of the player have been playing all of that time.  Now that they are comfortable with the game, VI goes and makes a big change that really would of went over better in the begining of the games life, not the maturaty of it.  I think that they should do a better job prioritizing there bug fixing.  I have seen some things that go into a patch that to me are not as worthy as attention as the Healing agro for instance.  I know what i think is more important is differnt from many ppl, but big changes should be done first.  Unless the little change affects the game in a big way.<P>Just my 2cp on this issue.<BR>Thanks for reading<BR>Senidyen</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, this has nothing to do with clerics but Alan went all off on tactics and how players will learn blah blah blah.<P>Charm.<P>Yep, its an ability that is great in thought.  And you even gave a few classes fixed duration charms at the highest levels.<P>Now I use it, and I use it a lot but with that said there are termendious problems with it.  And I'm not refering in any way drops at any waking moment.  To me that is what makes it a challenging skill to use.<P>I'm refering to the decrepid AI charmed pets have.  Here are some specifics.<BR>1.  Telling pets to sit down causes them to sit down for 1-10 seconds.  Then they stand up and start walking away from you and dont stop until you say follow (i.e. they try to wander to their spawn point and then decide to sit).<BR>2.  Following charmed pets won't cross arbitrary points in zones, instead they choose to take their own path (typically backtracking through the nearest AI path aka railroad track) to get to where you are.   Often training the whole zone on you.  And once they are next to you they often pace rather then stand stationary.  Typically running between you and the nearest railroad track and back again.<P>You can try this in lots of zones but for specifics you can try Rathe, and Overthere.<P>Basically pets use "normal" wandering monster AI (meaning they follow the railroad tracks you plant in the zones).  They also won't take the shortest distance between it and you, they will take the shortest distance between a railroad track and you.<P>Forcing players to learn the arbitrary points in a zone which charmed monsters won't cross is NOT something you can claim to be a feature of the game.  It is a flaw, a bug, and a needless headache to players that charm.<P>You should try any zone which has alot of internal pathing lines and walk across them to see what a charmed pet does and tell me it is as intended.<P>Now before you discount this completely and say "charm was meant to be difficult" keep in mind that the AI is easily abused.  You can use the fact that monsters walk to railroad tracks before moving towards you and keep a monster at maximum casting distance.  Allowing you to easily charm it again when charm fades.  And this is not something you intended.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Most 55+ clerics I know have 50+ twinks that they play. Most of those players seem to be playing thier twinks now. They just dont want to be the "Guinee Pigs" and die 10 times a night while Verant Shadows them to learn from thier own mistakes. Its not the way to do things, and they know it, and I cant blame those clerics. Id do the same with mine if I still played him.<P>Our guild usually does VP on saturdays. Didnt go this time. Not enough VP Key clerics online. <P>Ah well. <P>At some point the already dwindling high lvl cleric population had to die down. Nerf after nerf after nerf they all complained, but many just grudgingly trudged onward. This seems to be the straw that broke the camel's back. <P>The highest lvl clerics that do play still will do many of the mundane normal grinds. But ask them to go to a huge raid? Why would they? Ask yourself that.<P>Verant admitted as much as they would be fodder for thier "ubermob" testing. <P>This change was not finished. They finished a few parts of it, and I agree that it made sense to do, but they never prepared the cleric to handle the new playstyle. They didnt re-tune the ubermobs, they didnt add new defensive skills or skillcaps to the cleric, they didnt adjust the evade type spells so the cleric could actually use them, and they didnt give clerics any positive changes at all. <P>Just shared clerical abilites with the other healer classes, lowered the aggro on all taunting classes, and hightened the aggro severely on clerics. <P>Then they say, well... we dont know how its going to be like... we will just watch you guys die and we'll evaluate it then. <P>/rofl. Sure. <P>As if playing a cleric was all that fun to begin with.<P>Surprisingly shortsighted and condescending view on our players this time by Verant.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, all I can really say at this point (as a 54 warrior who can't really taunt, with a 54 cleric fiance) is that the changes were not for the better. <P>We were in PoF last night, the vast majority of our 50+ attendees being experience players who have been there many times before. I'd say we had 20ish taunters, and we thought this would be a fairly routine run. With that many people, it's rare that a CH would be necessary...big heals for the pullers sometimes, small heals to top off the tanks. <P>When such minimal healing causes a mob to aggro our clerics to the point that those 20ish taunters could not budge the mob...something's wrong. Two of our clerics had 10 deaths between them, not coming from horrible pulls but rather from normal pull situations that pre-patch, could have been dealt with fairly easily. <P>Absor, you know me and you know that I've been playing long enough to have some sort of a clue. These changes do not convey a sense of new challenge, of something to look forward to defeating. They feel like a completely artificial attempt to change the dynamics of the game, make things harder for uber-encounters and essentially slow everyone down. In my case, as a 54 warrior with little ability to taunt in the first place, you've made my job even harder. <P>You say that you're truly affecting only a small percentage of people in epic encounters. Once we hit 51+, it's those epic encounters that we're interested in. I think you're affecting a larger  portion of the player base than you might think, and in such an artificial way that it adds nothing positive to the game. You're telling clerics that they should stop healing as much, or as effectively so that they may live. I'm sorry, but I think a wizard can turn it off FAR more easily than a cleric with a near-dead puller heading into camp. Comparing the two situations doesn't work. Clerics are healers, which is a bit more time sensitive; if I'm near death, I need that heal NOW! whereas a nuker can probably wait a few more seconds for the next spell and not watch a group-mate die. <P>To close, we've only had a few days to see these changes. Hopefully the rest of your class balancing will place things in a better light. I hold little hope of this, considering your posts in the warrior forum tend to focus on the loudest dissenters, ignoring the more well thought out posts. But I'll bite my tongue to wait and see. I'll only say that artificial handicaps, such as making our healers the best taunting class out there, don't increase the challenge...they increase the frustration. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor/Abashi whoever.. yours is the role of the Dungeon Master whom all your 'players' have figured out some of your best tricks. You want revenge, but if it's direct attacks it'll look bad. But a little nerf here and a little nerf there and all will work out nicely.<BR>Well the extra aggro on healing wasn't a very swift move.<P>IE:<P>Queen in Chardok = Death Touch for any cleric that casts a healing spell on a warrior. And no one can taunt the queen off at all now. Not even a wizard nuking. Cleric hits DA.. DA wears off .. queen resumes.. DB.. repeat.<P>It's a very bad change since you never bothered to even give it a shot on the test server. Why bother even having a test server? If you had put it on the test server, I can guarantee you would have gotten feedback about it rather quickly.<P>I know it really isn't your fault Alan, but Brad shouldn't be driving anymore. He lost his license to game design a long time ago.<P>Anyone with at least a margin of experience in design knows that a drastic change after a game has been out for at least a year has no foundation at all. Unless it is a major exploit such as duping, patching gameplay such that it affects a majority, if not all, of the player's in the higher levels (and in some cases all of the player's even though they don't know it yet) is a very bad idea. It shows to everyone that Everquest does not have the gusto to cut it. It shows that if your design is proven flawed by any 0.01% of the game's population you must change it such that NO ONE can see a flaw in the game play.<P>You call for challenges.. trying to leap 10 storeys without a jetpack about covers it. There are acceptable challenges, and risk vs reward that you talk about. There is no risk vs reward. If it's too great, it disappears quickly.<P>Verant's design of EQ (now) can be summed up in one word:<P>Flawed.<P><BR>UO was the same way, when they started make it less 'fun' to play. M59 was the same as well. Alas, even now EQ may be hitting the 'not fun to play' stage due to developer's patching gameplay which has been around since the start of Norrath.<P>I don't care who your investors are, if you gave them creative control.. well you do know what you are.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Have a nice day.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First of all, I'm not a cleric.  I'm a rogue.  Lvl 57, all that jazz.<P>Every time "we figure out some trick you didn't know about", guess what?  You come down on us with a change and a form letter "we did not mean for this encounter to be fought like that."  Again and Again you do it.  So everytime you change things (to "keep things dynamic") its like sticking your hand into a dark pit that may or may not have a snake in it.  Do we get bit by the 'Dur, we didn't mean for you to kill him like that, NERF!' or do we get the "enjoyable" change in tactics?<P>Anyways, besides that obvious (to your players at least) side note, I've been grouping fine since that last patch.  Of course, of the 20+ odd hours I've logged in random camps, only like 3 of them had a cleric.  And I'm actually happy about that.  The lvl 54 cleric we had got tired of dieing do to CH aggro off of karnors crap and logged.  We got a lvl 48 shaman and exp went faster.  We actually had Less downtime, even though the heals were much much more suckass.  Why?  A) no waiting for cleric to zone back in, rez, med, self buff, etc.  B) Shaman slow actually kept up with the shaman heal output.  Even when the shaman got aggro'd by the heals and lower lvl, at least the mob was slowed.<P>After that, between happenstance, and choosing druid or shaman over the cleric (but having to save a slot for a paly/sk since warriors in no way, shape, or form can taunt off me now) exp has been flowing steadily in.  Slower than before the patch, faster than when I bothered to get a cleric.<P>Rezes were never a problem on the few times someone in the party died, there was always a cleric at zone-in LFG.<P>WTG Verant!<P>Ninen of Saryrn<BR>The War Council<BR>-Note: I have no problems with clerics at all, and would prefer to not have to exclude them, like pre-patch.  But EXP is king, and that king requires minimal downtime.

</FONT><HR>&gt;I know that many people don't like to hear me say this, but it's the truth. Healing aggro was broken. We need to fix it to make the game right. I hold to the truth that a game isn't good for anyone if the mechanics aren't right.<P>Alan<P>Why has this been the mantra of late? I swear you keep saying this about changes your making. Oh gee its broken and we are fixing it. Its NOT broken if thats the way the game has been forever. Maybe you need to get some decent QA so you don't "break" things and then leave them forever so people are used to it then all of a sudden yank it from under us.<P><BR>&gt;We are pretty happy with the change. There may be some fine-tuning needed for a few encounters. We'll be looking at those specific encounters and making decisions about them. We might make changes to those encounters. We might make changes to the aggro effect. Or we might leave it as it is. But those specific areas will be looked at. Over all, we're pleased with the way things are working.<P>Of course YOUR happy you just pissed a bunch of people off and made the uber encounters less er unkillable.

</FONT><HR>Absor/Abashi,etc..<P>I want to respond to this quote:<P>"I encourage you all to get used to the new mechanic. Try out some new strategies. There are some tactics that clerics can learn from wizards here too."<P>As you progessively level, the variety of things you can do in a battle become greatly limited or specialized. This follows the high end game design you have made that requires certain classes for groups (and one that people hate because its huge downtime to find the "proper" group makeup).  Anyways, my job at higher level is strictly heal and buff. <P>Now, you have taken my best heal spell and made it a downtime heal only. If I'm fighting shrooms or some other mob encounter where the mobs hit like they are on roids and summon players then I'm not going to complete heal and get whaled on by the mob ( I could live with divine aura/barrier but then i have to heal myself and the seconday healer has to waste mana on me).  Thus, I have to use my less mana efficient spells to fight. What does this lead to? MORE downtime. Also, you have eliminated any use of any other spells I have besides heal and buff. I can't spare the mana to keep up a good killing pace. Not to mention casting a nuke and then following up with a heal on a player is big aggro now. Nobody wants to sit and med after each battle because the cleric is low on mana. Is this what you had in mind? to slow the game down more? Grinding through higher levels is bad enough already.  <P>Could I live with this change? Yeah I suppose. I just don't use complete heal in combat much anymore. You wanted to nerf complete heal and you did it good. There are no new "strategies" as you make it sound. You either heal the player when he is low on health or you don't, it's that simple<BR>I don't have the option like wizards to hold off on my spells because it might aggro. I HAVE to heal. I could use hp buffs to heal to avoid aggro but that's even less mana efficient.<P>Secondly, how come you didn't change all the high end uber encounter mobs when you put this change in??????  You knew this was gonna happen with the boss mobs. How much FUN do you think it is to cast one heal spell and then instantly die. I'm pretty much speechless on this. I don't blame people for saying they are just waiting for the next game now. I'm ticked off to.  This whole nerf was designed for the boss mob encounters because of what you saw FOH do and then you totally neglect those encounters in your nerf solution. I just don't get it.<P>Please explain<P>A ticked off customer.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Anthrax,<P>Since you obviously don't know, let me enlighten you.<BR>Unlike wizzies, Cleric's don't ALWAYS get to cast when it's best for us.<BR>For instance: Some Velious encounters (Velk's comes to mind) require CHeal to be cast, PRIOR to the pull.<BR>It would be easy to cast CHeal, after the tanks have absorbed much agro, but that isn't the case. Sometimes, CHeal is cast 2 rounds into the fight, just so you can hit the tank, when he has a bub and a half of red left.<P>Point:<BR>CHeal agro is ridiculously impossible, during semi-uber mob encounters. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As one person pointed out, we heal when needed, not becuse it suits us.  Offensive casters may have that luxury in most situations, a cleric does not.  If that what you guys were thinking, then wake up.<P>You guys didn't FIX anything.  You just broke it worse than it was in the first place.  You just shafted the cleric class even worse and made them MORE boring and you want to pat yourself on the back for "making the mechanics right"?   TWO years after release?<P>Thanks for addressing the "cleric issues", because now all I can do is heal, can't afford anything that may cause even more aggro, even if my mana does permit.  Wonderful fix.<P>On the Druid and Shaman issue, that was a good one.  You spent all that time making them very versatile classes with great soloablity, then realized there were not enough healers.  Now you strip the core spells out of the cleric lineup and give them to them.  Leaving clerics with combat effectiveness that pales in comparison and heals like that of a Druid and Shaman.<P>If you think that even comes close to balancing the 3 preist classes, you are sorely mistaken.  All you have done is relagted the cleric class to Res mules and Uber encounters where they just res stick each other after they die from a CH.<P>People have played it, they think it sucks, why do you bury your head in the sand and say all is well?<P>Find the right middle ground, sooner not later.  A take a long GOOD look at the cleric class and ask "Why would someone play this class over the other healers".  Res is not the answer.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The healing aggro changes seriously harms uber-encounters in Velious.<P>The only tactic you leave us is to chain CH heavy tanks.  With the new rise in mob hitpoints, a wizard dumping his full mana bar and doing 15k damage means jack squat.  You're forced to basically go all out melee beatdown...A druid quickly pointed out that with a shissar buff and his epic he actually did more damage doing MELEE than using spells!!  <P>The problem is you guys seem to have lost the ability to make a mob unique and require tactics.  From Nagafen to Venril Sathir.  But in Velious, its like you got lazy.  You know those homemade quake levels where the guy just makes a square room and puts 10,000 shamblers in it?  Thats what Velious is.  Its no thought given to the epic encounters beyond sheer numbers...those numbers being the damage the mob deals and the hitpoints it has.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Let me enlighten you, instill doubt only works a small percentage of the time.  On the off chance you succeed, your fear spell has a high chance of being resisted.  Factor in the 5-6 sec cast time and you have a fairly unreliable skill.  It’s not a necro spell where you get to fear on demand.

</FONT><HR>I apologize to all of the ppl who have been in combat. I don't know. I've just listened... <P>+++<P>As a former medic in the US Army, playing a cleric is particulary enjoyable above all other classes. Saving lives, RL or EQ, feels good. I'm sure many of the other 'Docs' out there randomly heal as they travel from one place to another. It is the nature of the beast. We learned, though, that it was necessary to take the Red Cross arm band off since sniping the medic was more demoralizing than hitting any one else on the team ("Rumors of War" Caputo). We are seeing this now in EQ as these posts attest. But medics understand part of the job means putting yourself in front of the harm that just caught up with one of your guys. You just think about what you've got to do and you pray it's enough. It's why they call you Doc.<P>But in RL, the guys in a medic's group have the ability to lay down covering fire. There are medevacs which come with gunships that will deter all but the most determined foe. There are even more options from air strikes and close air support. It's not as though they're always asked to dodge all of the bullets (not that it would stop them).<P>The medic is hardly ever exposed to the full force of the foe his guys are facing. Units would refuse to into the field knowing the medic would be slain the instant he tried to save one of them from certain death. LTs would tell their captains to issue their orders themselves or issue kevlar cots.<P>Where is the group's ability to preserve the cleric who does the same for them? Do clerics become the same as wizards waiting for the mob to be weak enough to survive using their abilities; meanwhile watching their tanks die one by one and hoping there is one left to heal? Was the game really this far out of balance in terms of game play? (read: not including business concerns)<P>I am adjusting to the change (where are those high green mobs?!) but I think there is a Phase II patch that needs to address the defensive skills a group has at its disposal. I remember in "Dragon Slayer" one kid with a fire-proof shield fought an Ancient Red Dragon to a draw. The only reason the dragon backed off was it couldn't slay the kid in one shot. It knew this was no simple-minded tasty morsel from the nearby village. This person had defenses and certainly a weapon. One does not risk the damage of dragon's breath to commune with nature. Dragons are very intelligent creatures as defined by the very nature of their magical abilities. Why would one EVER stick around to face a foe that could slay it under those circumstances? Why not wait until they are out in the open and it can slip up silently in the air to catch the party by surprise? That sounds like a dragon to me, not the lobotomized, compliant versions in EQ (my apologies to the dragon's designers but the dragons should run when the percieve mortal danger). Don't we all run for the zone the moment we know the battle is lost (ok, all of us except for a dear friend we named Custer who goes too far and stays too long...)? [*gotcha* and you thought you were untouchable now. never mess with Doc, Marine!]<P>So, I think VI has several options to quell the retirement of clerics:<P>(1) provides groups or the cleric a means to surpress the damage or its source in some way. Perhaps a clerical damage shield or a group DA spell.<P>(2) Install intelligence in the AI so the mobs react appropriately to a perceived threat. I don't think a dragon, god, or other high level mob sticks around if it knows it's going to die if there is a means of escape. Face it, the moment a dragon sees a group of high level casters with megga DDs it would be gone unless it had an indelible advantage to exploit.<P>(3) My guys would like this option the best. Leave aggro as it is today. Enhance the duration or effects of DA/B spells. Let the aggros run blindly past the tanks, casters, and pets to beat on the cleric. Now, apply the level of frenzy created by the heal (diff b/w #1 and #2 on the hate list perhaps?) against the mobs active defensive skills leaving it to rely on only its AC and HPs. Give +50% for anyone attemting a back stab (stacks for rogues with their skill) against a frenzied (beserked) mob and let the tanks deal with the being who dares to harm their Doc.<P>There's good reason to take out the medic first. We do it if we can against our foes in EQ. But in RL, the Docs have a chance of surviving their job. Not so in EQ, not by a long shot...<P>Armeedoc Curesall<BR>33rd Dwarven Cleric<BR>"Your Guild Name Here"<BR>Rodcet Nife<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I hope that this wasn't what the dev team camp up with to balance the cleric class with. Looking at the classes that were effected in the patch got some helpful spells and abilities updated. What did the cleric class get the shaft. Oh...we won't fizzle so much with remedy.... big deal!! My skill is over 200 and I ask myself why would I fizzle on a spell type that I cast 95% of the time. <P>VI stated that the update was to make the druid and shaman more useful in high in raids. What about the Clerics usefulness in  those same riads?? Why would you need a cleric when you can have a druid that can Buff better Evac and do DD verus a Cleric. Shaman can debuff MOBS buff PC better than the cleric. But it is felt that the cleric class is fine. How is this balanced when the shaman can SOW invis regain mana thru spell get a pet. VI thinks that cleric Buffs and healing along with out way the Druids and Shaman other traits. VI thinks that just because cleric can rez out shines those traits one thing is when was the last time any cleric rezzed someone in  the middle of a fight??? You wait until it's over!! Then you can try an find a cleric that can rez your friend you don't need one in your group at that point all you need to do is found one in the zone that would come an rez and I as a cleric have been asked this many times. WHY you say cause those other groups didn't need a cleric in there group and was I offered a split in there looting?? NO, but I was needed when it was over and that's when you get the calls that you are wanted when other don't want to go to the trouble of regain EXP. <P>If you look at it from a gamer point of view clerics are only in the game so that other classes don't have to go to the trouble of regaining exp at high levels. Is this fair as a in game practice?? Is it fair that VI is using the Cleric class to of set the the needs for guides and GM for doing rezs being that they are  the only one that can. If all cleric stopped REZZing and siad find a Guide or GM that's not our problem any more. We can rez but LIKE VI and we aren't thought highly enough in the other thing we do or would like to be able to do for our class to be fixed. Until our class is looked into for something more I'm only rezzing myself. bye and have fun.... If that was said by me and every other cleric on the server guide gm would be having a field day in petition. Look at the problem before it out group your IT FINE statements.   <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><P>Wow. Four pages of responses to my little teeny comments, including two by Absor.<BR>I'm honored.<P>OK, some more things I've noticed:<BR>First of all, I do use complete healing on Rangers and Paladins and SKs (oh my!). The hybrids I group with are generally 55+ and have enough hit points when fully buffed to justify using it on them.<BR>The Rangers, Paladins and SKs that I group with regularly have NO problem taunting mobs off me after a CH. Yes, I take a few more hits than I did prior to the patch. Yes, my guildmates have had to adjust their strategies. We went to Fear yesterday, I got pounded quite a bit more than I usually do. But I didn't die once, because we adjusted and tried different tactics until we found what worked.<BR>One detrimental thing I *have* noticed though is warrior taunt.If you wanted to give hybrids a more valuable slot in a group, then you did it. But now warriors can't do their job.<BR>Even a warrior with two jade maces, an FBSS and enchanter haste has a problem taunting a mob off a cleric, whereas a Ranger can just snare and a Paladin can stun and an SK can stack DoT upon DoT.<BR>A warrior's job is not to deal damage, we all know that other melees are better at dealing damage than a warrior. BUT a warrior's job *is* to TAKE damage. And now they can't do their job.<BR>I'm still fine with the changes to healing aggro. It keeps me on my toes and makes life more interesting.

And I can't see the difference between fighting a new NPC that acts differently and fighting an old NPC act differently.*<P>I agree 100% with that statement, the problem lies in you are changing the game. What you need change is the overall sweeping RP story you have in the game, that is the Dynamic world I had hoped for. Instaed you have decsided to make two extremely soloable healing classes more group friendly and make the healing class that has had to rely on grouping near imposible to play.

</FONT><HR>I was in Karnors lastnight and noticed no real problems with clerics that us warrior could not handle ( yes I am not a cleric, this is just my opinion only ) except on a couple of occasions. However, I did notice alot less cleric's playing lastnight and I mean alot less. <BR>I can also see some concern with CH in Velious. The clerics have got to Chain-CH warriors and others there and with the new aggro changes it makes fighting there a mute point all togther. Yes it may be do by some, but it will mean alot of deaths. If anything, this shows you how unbalanced the NPC's are in Velious towards PC's. Its completely redicules that a lvl 50 Warrior, Ranger etc., can be a**kicked by a green con NPC there. God, don't even mention fighting a blue con solo or with just 2 or 3 ( pre-patch with a cleric and druid this was mandatory minimum for the SoWing and CH's ). Wonder what it will be like over there now.<BR>Also with the changes to Defense and such, us warriors have had our "tank" status stripped of us. I see so many warriors wanting a group now all the time and just cannot find any. Most say there looking for an SK and suck. I saw 2 lvl 55+ warriors lastnight spend 4 hours looking for a group and no luck. I have had a grand total of 2 group in the past 9 days myself and I play everyday. Its so hard to find one that I would almost rather stop playing, As it has become a waste of time to even log-on anymore.<P>Lvl 48 Warrior<BR>Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What I find as the interesting element behind the patch changes is this...<P>A) Warriors taunt post 50 has major problems.  <BR>B) Every character in EQ wants warrior taunt to be fixed post 50.<BR>C) Verant stated that warriors are fine and every player out there is wrong.<BR>D) In the patch Verant makes taunting even harder.<P>1) Clerics nearly universally have expressed a need for the class to be more engrossing (versus nerve wracking).<BR>2) High end cleirc burnout from lack of enjoyment isvery high.<BR>3) Verant stated that clerics are just fine and everyone else is wrong.<BR>4) verant makes it harder to be a cleric.<P>I find it vastly interesting that Verant has the preconcieved notion that warriors and clerics are just peachy keen and nothing said by anyone, not even the vast majority of players, is going to dissuade them.  <P>Meanwhile, verant has this whole "class balance" series of discussions where they are tossing out changes and improvements like candy, but open discussions on warriors and clerics by comming right out and stating that they should expect no changes.<P>This is the problem when verant has pre-decided what classes will recieve changes.  They have no real intention of listening to the players on these topics.  They are merely using us to put public discussion out to support changes that they were willing to make.  If you ask enough, SOMEONE will support a change.  So they ask until folks support the changes that Verant wanted to make.  <P>This has nothing to do with finding out what needs to be done to improve the classes.  It's a PR effort to get the players behind changes that Verant wanted to make anyway.<P>Bah!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 9 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=061314&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=061314&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
