</FONT><HR>Ester,<P>I realized why you closed the earlier thread.  However, I think you missed the issue.  As Vendrix originally raised it, the problem was the large number of LDs that tend to happen when any 'uber' mob is engaged, especially those with AE effects and/or damage shields.  As soon as everyone attacks, people start going LD rapidly, whether they have modems, cable, DSL.  These people had no lag issues before the attack, and none once the fight is over.  It's not being caused by a random event like a line being cut  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Unless construction workers cut fiberoptic lines every time my guild takes on the Overking in chardok<P>Player speculation is that it's caused by the high number of player hits/mises, Mob hits/misses, damage shield hits, and AE effect hits that are being sent to each player's client.<P>I realize that this may not necessarily be a bug by normal definitions, but it does seem to be a flaw in game design.<P>Aganerral Pardus<BR>Erollisi Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Unfortunately turning off the messages will not solve the actual problem. The problem is that even though you turn off the messages, the server is still flooding your connection with the packets of information about all the swings, damage shield burns, ae effects and so on. It's like a denial of service attack.<P>There needs to be a way that filtering those messages in the client prevents the server from sending them to you and overloading your connection.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>We have tried everything...turning everything off, even out of game (via dxdiag removing sounds)...I've fiddled with my datarate at every setting imaginable (I play on a cable connection). While some things can make it marginally better, it is VERY noticable with repeated play what is causing this. It's the spam you're getting, even though you do not see it. Mobs that AoE show this VERY clearly. A dozen super hasted tanks with low delay weapons spamming you with their hits (even though you do not see the hits) show this.<P>It has a lot to do I think with how the game has evolved. A few tanks swinging at Naggy with yaks is far, FAR different than those same groups today taking on Velketor. We're getting spammed into oblivion no matter what we try.<P>The following URL shows you a picture of what happens SO very often at these encounters...take a quick minute to look at it. We see this so often it's become the norm.<P>http://www.legacyofsteel.com/images/screenshots/december/12_16/lds.jpg<P>Thanks.<BR>~Shaz<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ester, not to be completely rude, but you are missing the point of this by a mile.  Its not a laggy server in cincinati, or a bad isp. 30 people from different parts of the country all experiencing the same thing at the same time only when they are all beating on the same mob is not a coincidental burp in the internet, it is a easily repeatable and real problem.<P>1) since vellious was released the amount of over lag has increased dramatically.  Whether its server load, the increase of people or what I don't know.  <P>2) anytime you put 18-24 people in close proximity whaling on a mob, people are going to lag out badly and most likely have a few LD's.  Put more people together and they start dropping like flies.<P>3) turning off everything means nothing, it is client side filtering, all it does is allow you to read the chat window.  Adjusting the datarate has marginal effects for those on dsl or cable and not much of anything for anyone else.<P>4) Testing this on the test server with minimal population and a t1 connection to the server means jack.  Go home, log into a live server with a 56k and get in a group to go kill velketor, dain, tormax, trak, gorenaire or anything else that takes 24+.  See how many LDs you experience if you can even stay connected. <P>This is a quality assurance issue and it should be in this forum.  The quality is piss poor for the upper level encounters.  The connection between the client and server cannot handle the information being passed.  No amount of client side filtering is going to change that.  The game mechanics have to be changed, namely server side filtering.  <P>The end game (large scale raids, planar and dragon/god encounters) demand that we have 18-50 people standing around beating on a mob.  Through game design, you have demanded that we group in large numbers to be able to continue with the game.  Verant needs to acknowledge that and compensate for the shear amount of data that is being passed back and forth.  We have turned off every sound, spam, graphic, name, and anything else that came around and it doesn't change a thing.  Server side filters are required.<P><BR>Malase</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yes, and changing the datarate doesn't fix it.<P>There's simply a finite amount of data the server can send the client before the client is too overwhelmed. You can't fix it with new drivers. You can't fix it by turning down the detail and particle effects and clipping rate and graphics options. You can't fix it by turning off all the chat window spam. The data is still flooding the client. Whether you choose to view it in the chat window or not is irrelevant.<P>You *can* make a tiny dent in it by dispelling a monster's damage shield. Without the damage shield the server isn't spewing a zillion "soandso is burned" messages every moment to every client. However, it's not even close to enough by itself - it's just a drop in the bucket. <P>Basically it all boils down to controlling how much data the server is firing off at the clients. As players, there is VERY little we can do to reduce that without crippling our combat effectiveness, but a reasonably bright programmer should be able to develop a simple scheme that prevents the server from sending data that the client is filtering.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I love that picture  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Dozens of PPL LD, droping till the server can handle it again... Thats not a solution though. <BR>My bet is that it압 not that easily solved, Your PC NEEDS the information bout that DMG shields, hits and so on. Thats how it calculates the Hitpoint bars of you and your group members. Of course you can tell the server not to spam it, but then you will be a little surprised to hear the cleric saying "What happened ? You just droped dead !" AFTER you been rezed.<P>There might still be a way. If there would be a spam switch, telling the server that this computer does not want to hear the whole story, but just a update of the combined HPs every 3 secs. Still had a lot of disadvantages, but might be the only way really working. This would consume a huge amount of server power, though. On the other hand, its mostly some special encounters where it really counts. Make this switch working only in Plane areas and maybe dragon dungeons could do the trick. Or if it압 still to much, just make it work automatically if one of those uber MOBs is actually engaged in battle. Maybe that압 the best solution anyway, pick the uber MOBs that cause this and as soon as theyre  encountered cancel all messages but the combined HPs droping in that zone. Make a "statistics" Button for the PPL interested and let it display the actual combined DMG done or received. Nothing else...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Lets be realistic, there's a lot of data you don't need. Do you need to recieve the data for the AE hitting every player, for every damage shield burn, and so on from the server? You could substitute all that by just sending frequent health updates on the health status of the five other people in your group and less frequent updates on the people around you unless their health makes a drastic change.<P>Next time you do a raid turn off ALL your filters and log the results. Take a look at the big mess you have there.

Yes it does currently "work as intended".  That doesn't mean that it works well and doesn't need to be fixed.<P>Ralph: The client doesn't need the information at all.  Hp updates are sent from the server anyway.  And aren't sent every combat hit.  That is why you see mobs hps drop in chunks anyway.  There is no reason for everyone to get others hits and damage shield messages.

So solloution i think is to make the filters server side or to make a /raid and when you are in /raid nothing but your spells and your hits and the comunication channels like ooc auc gu are sent.<P><BR>Zipherius Thaladar<BR>Level 53 Warrior<BR>Tarewmarr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yes, putting all of the info server side will save money on bandwidth issues.  Granted it does put a little more strain on the server because it has to make 1 extra check on whether to send the info or not, but it would also make the game playable.  Please at least address the issue let us know that it is being looked into, and possibly some sort of timely update.  <P>It is frustrating as hell for people to go through this.  I know that everytime I go on a big raid with my guild I will get disconnected multiple times.  That is frustrating as hell.  If it doesn't improve, I wouldn't be suprised if high levels started dropping out of the game because they cannot do anything.  They have conquered the level game, doing the other encounters are what is left that is fun, if you cannot do them, what is the point?<P>Malase</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ester,<P>Datarate only works so much.  All the clients actually get all of the data, and the EQ client filters what you dont want to see.<P>For example:  Server is transfering 5k of data to the EQ client.  Even if you have filters on for bardsong, damage shield, hits, etc. its still 5k of data.  The packets need to be built at the server level (aka filters at the sever level) so if I don't want this data I don't get it.<P>Additionally, if this is to much of a pain, then just make a RAID filter that is server side.  This superceeds all client settings with a preset values (DS off, bard songs me, hits me, etc etc) just enough data for the necessities.  This would keep ALOT of people on slower links from being LD.<P>Istari, MT</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just from the symptoms, it sounds like the networking code doesn't have any rate limiting built into it.  The servers should have a cap on the amount of info that it can transmit over a given period and should queue or drop non-essential packets that exceed this limit (others hits and misses, others damage shields, others casting, information from outside a reduce aperture size, etc).  From the most basic standpoint, the server appears to be performing the equivalent of a brute force denial of service attack against the client during raid level encounters.  Kinda funny when ya look at it in that light, but definitely a serious problem.<P>Another point, the server code seems to use an aperture size of the entire zone for creature locations and for some reason sends information on what loot it is carrying as well.  I'm betting the massive aperture size is because of tracking ability, but it doesn't need to be sent to character who cannot track and I can't think of a single reason why you would need to transmit information about loot until a loot related event happens (pickpocketing, looting a corpse, etc).  As a side benefit, it'd reduce the effectiveness of programs like ShowEQ and significantly cut down on overall bandwidth costs.  On a product this size, reducing the number of packets sent by even a small amount can have a huge effect on the overhead.<P>Unfortunately, I can't really see Verant rewriting their network layer this late in the game, but if they're aware of the problems, they should plan their boss level encounters with the understanding that 30+ players is the equivalent of a DOS attack on the applicable clients.<P>Rashere Al'Ayahd<BR>Ayonae Ro<BR>Bunnies of Chaos</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Greetings all,<P>I decided to post a better description of the datarate.txt file.<P>The Datarate.txt file can range in numbers from 1 to 10. This is basically the size of the packets you will receive.  The larger the number, the larger the packet size.  It normally defaults to 5.0. For strong fast connections many players increase the number to increase zoning times, and speed in the game.  If you feel you have a good connection, you may try 7.0 first to see how you like it. Some people go all the way up to 9.0.  With a high number, if you ever have packet loss due to connectivity problems while playing you will lose more packets. With a large amount of packet loss you might see a lot of ghosting.  This is where things will appear to be in a spot that you see on a screen but are actually somewhere else according to the game. If you feel you have a weak connection, you may try 3.0 first to see if it helps. This reduces ghosting but can increase zone times.<P>The best way to troubleshoot connection problems is by running a trace route. Goto start, programs, ms dos prompt, or type in command.com on start run. In this command line prompt type in tracert &lt;domain name&gt; the domain name will change from server to server. Below is the domain names for the servers your tracing to.<P>In the trace route you want to see everything under 300 milliseconds. The lower the number the better the connection. You do not want to see any *'s. This usually means the packet has just timed out.<P>You can try different connection numbers to your ISP, if you have a dial up modem. Sometimes this takes you a different route and avoids problem areas. Usually routing problems are temporary and you just have to wait it out. <P>server		domain name alias<BR>  <BR>Druzzil Ro            druzzilro.everquest.com<BR>Povar                     povar.everquest.com<BR>Login                    eqlogin1.everquest.com<P><BR>Have you tried a different ISP to see if you can connect via them?<BR>If you have problems with connecting to the Internet and have bad ping times please contact your Internet Service Provider.   <P>If you have any network security programs or Firewall programs try temporarily removing them completely from your system, to see if that helps.<P>If you have ICS you will need to open your UDP ports from 1024 through 9000 and your TCP port 7000.<P>If this does not help you should also check your system for computer viruses.<P>Some of you use ICS.  We do not directly support ICS.  We do not make ICS programs and they can be rather complex.  We would like you to do some research for yourself to learn how to use ICS.<BR>Please go to www.dslreports.com and do their tweaks for high-speed connections until you have a healthy connection.

You might also want to go to www.modemhelp.com<P>There is talk about reducing your MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) size so you have an even stream of data instead of a stream of data that alternates with a big packet and a small packet.

</FONT><HR>Can verant dance around this topic anymore?  How many times do we have to say it?  WHEN YOU HAVE THAT MANY PEOPLE AROUND A MOB DATARATE DOES NOT MEAN A DARN THING.  You are sending too much information for the client to handle.  It doesn't matter if we can set datarate to 1000, it isn't going to change anything.  Those who are not on broadband cannot stay connected.  Any encounter that requires 18+ people dumps anyone who is on dial up or less.  Telling people to check on different ISPs and other stuff is total crap.  Having 40 out of 50 people go LD during a fight and it happening repeatedly is far more than conclusive evidence that it is more than an isolated incident.  <P>Don't tell us you cannot recreate it.  Testing on the test server from the verant office with a t1 connection and minimal population is not testing the issue.  Front up some money and pay for a test box with a dial up modem and test on a live server.<P>Quit dancing around the issue and trying to throw bandaids at a severed limb. We aren't asking for miracles here.  We aren't asking that all of these problems be solved by the next patch.  What we are asking for is someone to actually acknowledge the fact that an aspect of the game has become unplayable for a large portion of the customer base and that a fix is scheduled/in the works and will be along as soon as possible.  That isn't too much to ask.  Good grief you all are all over the threads about missing helm graphics and that is just a minor glitch that doesn't actually affect gameplay.

</FONT><HR>Thank you David for your post, it's a helpful guide and has some great info on how to improve your overall connection ranging from dial-up to Cable.  <P>However, it does not address the issue that a lot of us are seeing with large-scale raids.   Rashere's post above illustrates a fundamental problem with the way your network is distributing data down to the client.  The changes you've spoken about will probably help some people stay connected during a large scale battle but they still do not fix the problem.  I personally have a high-bandwidth connection and thrive in the luxury of it but have *still* had the problem that a lot of people are with going LD on a large raid battle.  The Data.txt adjustments are not going to do anything for me when my connection is clogged with unnecessary data.  Even DSL gets to this point on occasion, I've seen it, had it happen, and can recognize what's going on by looking at the log info generated from my hardware monitoring software.<P>I urge you to take a closer look at Rashere's post as he's right on the money with his observations.  And Ester, to be honest Malase is also correct if you are going to be testing this issue at Verant's offices connecting to the test server locally and over an extremely high-bandwidth connection such as a T1 or local LAN, you'll never reproduce it except on slower computers that can't take the data input.<P>You may not have the capability of testing this as it needs to be tested, on at least 30 different clients all connected via dial-up.  This is one issue that you're going to probably have to take the player base's word on.  A server side prioritization scheme or set of filters able to track and monitor the client's preferences and connection state really need to be implemented.<P>Cymbre Shadows<BR>Ayonae Ro<BR>Bunnies of Chaos<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I guess I should have expected that response.  Modifying the packet size will help some, but with the amount of information being sent during boss level encounters, it has a fairly small effect.<P>Let me lay it out.  A computer can only receive information over a network, convert, and process it in a certain amount of time.  When you overload that, it gets queued up on a client side buffer.  The buffer is meant to handle spikes in data traffic and will usually flush out rather quickly.  When you sustain a transfer rate beyond the capacities of the receiving computer to convert and process the data, you will eventually fill up and overflow the buffer.  When that happens, the client will cut the connection.  That's just the way it works.  Obviously, the better the connection and the bigger the buffer, the longer that will take to happen, but you will eventually drop anyone if you sustain the transfer rates you currently have during raid level encounters.  <P>The reason modem users are the ones who usually drop is because modems can't handle nearly the amount of information that cable/dsl/t1 users can.  Once the modem users drop, the information flood lessens, the buffers of the remaining people flush, and all is happy in the world again.  If you were to have a raid of all perfect connection DSL users, you'd still lose people to the buffer overflow until the information load lessened to the point where the people left remaining could handle it.<P>This is why you have server side rate limiting.  What this does is watch the amount of traffic being sent to each individual client.  When it reaches a certain point, it throttles back and drops non-essential information until the amount of data falls back under the set limit.  This stops you from flooding a client and kicking it off-line.<P>Let me throw out some suggestions on how to reduce the amount of data being sent to the client and hopefully eliminate this problem.<P>- Move the client filters to server side filters.  If someone doesn't want to see damage shield info, for example, theres no reason to send them that data at all.<P>- Set up a client side command that toggles a server side flag.  The flag would tell the server to stop sending all non-essential information to the client.  It would likely result in tracking being inoperable until the flag is shut off, but that would be a small price to pay for being able to stay connected during a boss level encounter.<P>- Audit the information being sent to the clients and trim out anything unnecessary, like how much cash a creature on the other side of the zone is carrying.  This would also take care of your ShowEQ problems to a certain extent.<P>- Enable/change the rate limiting on the servers.<P>I really recommend passing this thread on to a network engineer.  It's fairly basic networking information and they should be able to immediately see where the problems lie and hopefully correct them.  As Everquest ages, its moving towards more and more boss level encounters and this problem is affecting more and more people.<P>Rashere Al'Ayahd<BR>Bunnies of Chaos<BR>Ayonae Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Verant has never had much of a solution to the problem, because there isnt a feasible work around to sending all data to the client-<P>In a large scale battle when a mob has an ae effect, all data is sent to the client. Since the AE has a resistance check on all players resist/level, it cant be inferred by the client what the damage done to that player would be. Since you can click on any player during one of these fights to check their health ( assuming you arent LD anyway ) the client still has to know what that person's "status" is. <P><BR>I agree that the solution is finding a way to not send the amount of data to the client that is currently being sent.

You know, not on the office LAN directly connected to the EQ-system.<P>Vendrix<BR>Da`Kor</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>you know, there are only 3 things that need to be server side filters.  <P>1) other hits.  This is the main one.  Mob hps vs the damage they take can easily be updated in bulk (they don't update with every hit anyway).  A hit counter or 2 can be sent to kick an animation.  Players swinging speed doesn't reflect actual swings anyway, seems to already be preset with %haste/slow, duel wield etc set, if not, it can be and just send info for attack on/off and changes to haste/duel wield/weapon type as needed.  You can seperate and have mob hits to players send as normal so that player hps are always updated, a mob does not swing enough to cause extreme lag and LD issues.  Even AE spells don't cause enough lag by themselves.  Its the 50 swings a second from players that causes this problem.<P>2) Damage shields.  Player hps can be updated at the end of each combat round.  No damage shield is realistically high enough to kill that quickly.<P>3) Tree animations.  This is extraneous fluff to begin with.  If you look at zones with lots of trees, the ones where every tree has an animation are terrible.  Burning woods is mildly bad because of the number of trees but there aren't as many animations,  Wakening Lands is almost un-navigible because every tree has an animation.  Its all nice and pretty but it is fluff that makes the game almost unplayable.  <P>If you fixed these 3 things, all of these threads would go away.<P>Thanks<BR>Malase</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>David - eqcsr<P>If you actually read these posts you would see that people are not complaining about thier connections to the game dring normal game play. They are complaining about being kicked out of the game during the EPIC fights. During normal game play ( Not in epic fights) I have a very good connection. I recently changed my provider to provide me with a better connection during normal game play.<P>As Vendrix posted in his original post the amount of data being sent to the client in these fights is just too much info for connection. its like trying to force a watermelon thru a drinking straw. Turning on your clientside filters doesnt stop the data from being sent to your client, it only prevents it from being displayed.<P>I think it was Brad who recently stated that they have some verant employees in some of the more well known uberguilds maybe Verant should talk to these people about this problem as they are the ones most likely to understand where we are coming from.<P>Kizmet<BR>Da`Kor E-marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Consider that we are allowed to play the game in 640x480, with low level of detail and low particle effects because some of us don't have real high end systems.  The "experience" may not be as pretty as someone with a big, bad P3-2Ghz system, but at least we can play.  I'm sure those of us in that sitation are glad to have that option.<P>Others of us are cursed by living in an area that has NO high-speed internet connectivity.  In my area, for example because the phone lines are about 50 years old, I can not connect any faster than 28.8k.  DSL is also not an option, as I live about 19,000 feet from the central office, and AT&T (our only cable provider) "has no plans to roll out broadband access in your area at this time."<P>However, I have no options in EQ to truly degrade my connection performance to make the game playable.  Using the filters, in their current implementation, does not help - the data is still being sent to me, but my client is choosing not to show it.  Therefore, I still get bumped all the time, regardless of my filter settings.  Realistically, I'm going to have to cancel my subscription because I am now level 57, and most, if not all, of my fun comes from participating in large-scale raids with my guild. Because my link gets flooded, I can't contribute after say, 15 seconds or so of the fight beginning, so really, I can't participate at all, and this is very frustrating.<P>(Believe me, I've optimized my crappy old 28.8k connection as far as it'll go.  It's not my fault 28.8k connections top out at ~3.5k bytes/sec!)<P>The only solution that'll help me is if EQ's servers could be told not to send certain types of data to me in the first place.  Here's what some folks are suggesting as far as filtering data being sent to the client, along with a my pro/con description.<P>Damage Shields<BR>Visual Impact: None.<BR>Data Impact: Significant.<BR>Notes: This information does nothing for the enjoyment level of the game, and in fact, makes it difficult to see vital communications between party and raid members. Most people filtered this as soon as it was available, and have never looked back.  Some folks, spellcasters especially, do want to know when a creature has a damage shield active, so they know when to dispel it.  However, in most large encounters, casting annul magic a few times is standard procedure, so actually seeing this information is unnecessary.<P>Others Misses<BR>Visual Impact: Marginal.<BR>Data Impact: Significant.<BR>Notes: I'm pretty sure that if another PC misses, it does not show them swinging their weapon; if this is true, then visual impact becomes "None". However, this more than anything probably causes more links to become flooded in large encounters. Most people, by level 5 or so, have turned this filter on as to facilitate seeing communications.<P>Bard Songs<BR>Visual Impact: Depends on Particle Setting, which is usually set to OFF for large raids.<BR>Data Impact: Significant.<BR>Notes: Even with particle density set to off, most bard effects still show visually to some degree.  However, in large-scale raid situations, this information is deeply extraneous.  Granted, the bard song information will still need to be sent to each individual client to show the songs affecting *them*, but it is not absolutely necessary to show bard affects for all other members of a raid.  I would predict that most people would turn this off for large encounters, then back on for smaller group experiences.<P>Others Hits<BR>Visual Impact: Significant.<BR>Data Impact: Significant.<BR>Notes: I'm sure this is what triggers the client to animate the various meleers being rendered.  While this is pretty, and can be considered part of what makes EQ so engrossing (look at the big ogre swing his sword!), we should be able to turn this on and off when it will adversely affect our connection (again, big encounters).  <P>Auctions/OOC/Shouts<BR>Visual Impact: None.<BR>Data Impact: Significant, in some areas.<BR>Notes: On our server, I get bumped just walking through high-trade areas.  East Commons has 100+ players in it at any given time, all spamming auctions as fast as they can.  Imagine my joy when I can not even pass through there without getting bumped, which is a double whammy, because depending on trade activity, I can sometimes not even log in!<P>Something to consider also, is that by allowing your servers to filter this data before it gets sent to the client, you are decreasing Verant, Inc.'s bandwidth requirements.  This could, in theory, reduce lag for *all* customers, and might even significantly reduce your monthly network traffic and equipment bills!  I say this because WE the CUSTOMERS really do care about YOU!<P>Love and sloppy kisses,<BR>Omisan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Quit dancing around the real issue's here and ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. These LD's have almost next to nothing to do with datarates or people's ISPs, and the long-time customers/players of EQ deserve BETTER than this from Verant. The system spec's Verant gave us state that a 28.8 modem connection is sufficient for Everquest. The FACT is that in the high level game where large numbers of people are required to complete a task, a 28.8 modem is NOT sufficient to stay connected to the servers. I have a great deal of faith in the programmer's at Verant, and I really believe that if this issue is looked at seriously a fix can be made that will make gameplay at high levels much more enjoyable for everyone. Please see if you can get it done for us.<P>Mezmur<BR>Tarew Marr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
