</FONT><HR>The same arguement can be used to increase the size of the texture memory.<P>95% of the customers have cards that can support a significant increase in the texture memory size and it would increase the enjoyment of the game for those people.<P>If they are keeping the requirements down to what was originally required when the game was purchased then adding DX7 will exlude some people and is breaching that commitment anyway.<P>Should we stay in the stone age of 3dfx video technology forever?  I dont think so.  If you going to slap people in the face you might aswell not do a half-hearted attempt at it and just increase the textured memory requirement whilst your at it.<P>You could double or even triple the requirement and it wont affect many people.  Hell, you can pick up an obsolete second hand voodoo2 that could handle the increase in textured memory for peanuts.<P>If we are going to force the game to remain stagnant and limited to technology at the time of design then EQ will have a very limited lifespan.<P>Sometime in the future we will have to buy EQ2 which will just exclude all these people from being able to play it anyway.  For god's sake lets take the easier and logical path to inevitability.<P>The game will require an improvement in resources in order for it to compete with new products being designed that utilise new technology.  Lets not drag the game down kicking and screaming.<P>You dont have to ask for Voodoo5 type capabilities, just increase the textured memory so you can add real improvements to the game that will improve everyones enjoyability.<P>I want my shaman to have bears for pets.<P>I want to see magicians with cool looking new pets.<P>I want to see Enchanters in the Troll illusion not naked, please... its awful!<P>I want to see bards stop playing drums like its a flute!<P>Why do we have to run around in a horse drawn kart when our competitors have ferraris?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  Lets move on or move out.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>What Abashi said is true - They are NOT upping the system specs.<P>You needing new hardware does not mean the base system spec has changed...if you work with 'puters a lot, you know this...<P>What is considered a DirectX compatible video card by definition HAS changed. EQ STILL requires a DirectX compatible video card. Verant did NOT change the DirectX set of APIs - Microsoft did.<P>Under system requirement, the box states a DirectX compatible video card - thats what it required when it was released, thats what is required now. Nothing more.<P>Yes, the definition of what is considered DirectX compatible HAS changed. It is necessary that definitions of what is compatible with what constantly changes in the computer world.<P>If Verant seeks to remain competitive, and produce a technically viable product, they must continue to support that product - that much should be obvious. Part of supporting that product is making newer technologies available. I really don't see how they any real choice in the matter other than to migrate to DirectX 7a.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ummmm,<P>I'm not completley sure, but I think everyone that is currently playing the game will be able to play the game with DX7. DX7 is simply a free software upgrade for windows, and is independant from your card, with the exception that it must be direct X compatible. If you're playing now, then it is. All you have to do is go to microsoft.com and grab the upgrade. The only reason they made an issue of it was to give advance warning, and give everyone time to get the update before they made any changes. Bottom line, if your card will support DX5 or 6 (whatever is required for playing EQ) then it will also support DX7.<P>Rahzahm</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I am really glad they are doing the update. I am tired of having an 800mhz PIII with 256MB ram and a Voodoo 3 3000 come to a crawl when a spell is cast. Quake I runs smoother than EQ as it stands now. I am sorry for those who have older PCs, but times change, you can't run today's Windows on a PC that was made to run Windows five years ago. A new 3D card can be had for under $100, like a Voodoo 3 2000, or a TnT2 M64 card. Just get the PCI version if you don't have an AGP slot. This is a VERY positive thing for Verant to do. I considered leaving EQ because they didn't seem to be interested in improving the graphic engine. Welcome to the new Millennium (ok, so the new Millennium dosen't really start until 2001 but that's another topic).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I think if you read the statements by Abashi regarding the upgrade, they are QUITE sorry that this update changes the requirements.  I'm far from being a VAK but I think that they didn't arrive at this decision lightly.<P>But in all honesty, a video card that is compatible with DX7 shouldn't cost you more than $40 shipped.  If you're using a video card that isn't compliant, send it to the Smithsonian, it's gotta be the oldest working specimen of video cards.  You don't have to drop $200 on a GeForceII 128-bit card with 128MB of video RAM, a decent 16MB TNT2 card will work great.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>THey are not changing the requirements. They are maintaining the software that we all use. DirectX is maturing as time passes and it is the responsibility of the hardware manufacturers to provide the users of THEIR hardware with current and up-to-date drivers.<BR>Verant is (finally) upgrading their software to take advantage of what the latest version of DirectX has to offer. It is your hardware manufacturer that you should be blasting with cries of Breaking Promises etc. because it is they who decided that you are no longer important enough to put effort into supporting your old hardware that they made and sold at a proffit to YOU.<BR>If your hardware no longer functions due to a lack of updated drivers, you should voice your displeasure with them and never buy their hardware again. IMHO, most people know that the world of computers is constantly changing requiring constant upgrades to be able to play games. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
