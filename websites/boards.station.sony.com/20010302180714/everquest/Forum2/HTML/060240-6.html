</FONT><HR>People seem to forget that MANY people came to the Teams servers for TEAM PvP.  Then (like so many) were discouraged because of the balent abuse of the Invulnerable Healing exploit.  The "Light Alliance" purposefully bringing in same team healers to "suppress" any "resistance" against them.  The "Light Alliance" purposefully abusing this exploit day, after day, after day.....<P>PLEASE Verant.  Do NOT let this go un-addressed.  HARDCODE Teams, or at the very least fix it so Invulnerable Healers are a non-issue and so people can play the server as YOU created it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>For Tallon Zek, the options as I see them:<P>Option 1. Changes from 4 teams to 2, Good vs. Evil. That's how a majority of the people play anyways.  This wouldn't hurt anyone as this is generally how darks look at the server and lights xteam to make it this way.  Make it so the two teams cannot buff or heal each other.  I do say ressurections and summon corpse should be able to be used by either side on anyone.<P>Option 2. Simply, hard code the teams don't allow crossteam healing and buffing.  This in my opinion would get back to the heart of the server, pure pvp with 4 teams.<P>Option 3. Although I think diety based teams is the best idea from a roleplay perspective I don't see Tallon being changed in such a way, rather a new server built around such.  Basically you'd have 3 teams rather than 4, Good, Evil and agnostic/neutral.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First order of business: Don't EVER ruin RZ with that coin only bluebie crap please =)<P>Actually DO SOMETHING when there is a report of corpse camping, bind camping, training, bank killing going on. These are the worst people and you always let them get away with these things.<P>Don't mess with the HT ability of SK or the drain of necros. Leave them as they are, please.<P>Make FR and CR work better. These don't seem to work so well for some reason.<P>Please, please, please make bags lootbale. Not the whole thing, but one item from inside. Naked casters risk nothing and gain everything if they win, which they do most of the times against a warrior in full plate.<P>Nerf the n00b guards. Do you really need a lvl 45 guard to kill a lvl 1 bat? Keep the guards high lvl for quests such as the FP guards. Nerfing them down to the lvl of the guards in Nektulos seems about right.<P>DUELING: If someone has accepted a duel, make a tag on them so healing or killing of one or both of the players becomes impossible by others until the duel is over by a victory or someone zoning out.<P>I know there are plenty of other things but these are the most important IMO. The thing I'd like to see the most is lootable items from bags. <P>Thx for ya time,<P>Tejan Tecate<BR>Darkenbane<BR>36 Druid of Innoruuk<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>WHY DON't WE ANSWER ABSOR's QUESTIONS  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Absor said:<BR>&gt;I understand this. My question to you is, what is worse for the community, invulnerable healers and buffers or the idea that some guild members might have to start new characters? I don't think there's an easy choice here. But if it comes down to it, a game with the right mechanics might have to be the right choice over community, because without a good game how can you really foster a community. At least those are my thoughts on the matter.&lt;<P>Cross-teamers are acting like they will have to completely abanden their guilds if teams are hard-coded.  They won't.  It will add a little extra chalenge on big raids thats all.  They will just have to take race into account when forming groups.  The server is mature enough that there are enough of the vital classes spread out across the teams that this is doable.  Yes it will be harder, but I think most of us who play on PvP servers expected a greater challenge.<P>Remember when you took away item loot from Tallon Zek and the majority of people whined and complained about how this would completely ruin the server?  Then after item loot was around for a month almost everyone likes it.  Hard-coding teams will be much the same I think.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1) Egg Shaped Pumice needs to be put back into the PvP game, at the VERY least in a self only form. The reasons for this are already well documented.<P>2) Druids are overpowered in PvP, and to a lesser degree, necros. This may be an opinion question. But with the new heals for druids they're going to be borderline untouchable.<P>3) Now that you've cranked up the hp and gear curves for melees over 50, you've got to crank up the spell damage on direct damage spells in PvP to compensate.<P>4) Lesser issues with faction, which have already been well complained about.<P>5) Out of range healing by people on different teams on the team servers... i.e. a low level elf and dwarf are fighting, and a dwarf cleric comes along, and for some reason (guild crossteaming, feeling dwarf is a "PK", etc.) the dwarf decides to betray his team and heal the elf. This has to be handled for the low level scene to have a level of respectability.<P>6) More stuff I can't think of right now  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>First of all, Let me start out by saying thank you for having a thread about PvP.  I can imagine that of all the potential problems that arise in the game, the most divisive and time consuming must come from the PvP servers.<P>Here are my thoughts and suggestions:<BR>Thoughts<BR>1.	EQ is a VERY different game on PvP than it is on the Blue servers.  Our strategies, goals, alliances and tactics are ruled by our relationships with other players.<P>2.	On PvP servers, we expect that adversity can or will be the outcome of any situation.  On Blue servers, other players are there to interact with, and help you…on our servers they are there to we wary of (at least initially).<P>3.	For us, the greatest goal is being able to beat someone else.  That is why we levels, gain equipment, learn tactics, and make alliances.  Everything else is secondary.<P>4.	The best analogy between the types of servers is that EQ on blue servers is more of a game like Myst…the goal is solving riddles, and personal achievement through accomplishment.  While those things are somewhat important on PvP servers, they are only valued at all if they give you an advantage over someone else.  In other words, on Blue servers they are an end in themselves…on PvP servers, they are merely a means to an end.<P>5.	If you apply the same lines of reason to these servers when making changes as you do to others, it will not work.  For all intents and purposes, it MUST be viewed as a completely different game.<P>Suggestions<BR>1.	Regarding a true 4 team server; I love the idea, but understand the concerns that people have about relationships they have grown.  The suggestion then is that where possible, allow players an option of transitioning a characters to a race that allows that class.  I realize that make take some doing, but if we take as a given that relationships are most important (both positively and negatively) but if I am in a guild that will become all Elves, and I have a lvl 50 Dwarf cleric, allow me to turn him into a lvl 50 High Elf cleric.  As long as my equipment will transfer (and in those cases where it won’t, create some equipment substitutes), the relationships I have are much more important than my race.<P>2.	This is a big one…STOP TESTING **** ON BLUE SERVERS AND IMPOSING IT ON US.  Nothing will make people angrier than imposing rules on them that the people creating them don’t understand the consequences of.<P>3.	Create some real enforceable guidelines when it comes to loot and scoot.  I realize that it is a player made guideline, but that was because there was a void from you guys.  It isn’t a good system (hell, it isn’t even a good system) but at least it is understandable and consistent.<P>4.	Get some GM’s that really do something.  I would imagine that on PvP servers, only about 10% of the requests/complaints come from game problems (corpses stuck in walls, LD and can’t find corpse, etc.), and that 90% come from interpersonal problems.  Give them some teeth…I would rather see some of them use a little judgment and make some wrong decisions, than stand there ineffectively doing nothing.<P>5.	For God’s sake, get rid of faction hits on duels.  Duels are supposed to be honorable, trust me I think the townsfolk would understand if one of their own fought honorably and was defeated, verses being gangbanged after slaughtering a tough mob.  This should be an easy fix.<P>6.	An 8 level range for killing others is insane in some cases…the lower played doesn’t stand a chance.  Bring it down to 4.<P>I'v got plent of other items, but they tend to be race-class specific, and I don't think it servers the purpose well to introduce them into this forum.<P>Koolcat<BR>32 Cleric<BR>Tallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Okay I would first like to state that their is a second person here posting this with me... two opinions here.<P>I alone would like to cover the cleric class. As well as enchanter while Im at it. and for that matter anyone who's pvp skills depend on MR. Mostly though is clerics and enchanters. <BR>Our offensive ablities rely on all MR. Both cleric and enchanter. Now, our spells arent extremely powerful as clerics, but when they ALL get resisted by a mere 45 MR, that is pathetic!<BR>Enchanters atleast get tashan, clerics get no such line. Just take a look at MR and you will see. Perhaps you need to improve the ability to get spells off, or you need to reduce the effects of MR. but if you do so, make sure you also reduce the effectivness of some spells out there, like root, snare, and many others. Snare for one is to hard to resist and to drastic of a disadvantage. Root is lethal but it currently has a good resistance ratio IMHO.<P>DoT's are far to effective against classes that cant cure them, like rogues and warriors. They get kited to easy. And with snare/ darkness it is to hard to resist them.<P>CROSSTEAMING I want to play on a TEAM server, not on a light vs dark server. There are 4 teams, not 2. And in addition PANDEMONIUM on TZ is just plain out pathetic. they are a guild of every race on a team server...they have no RP concept and use your own race against you with healers, buffers from the same team.<P>PLEASE reduce the level difference to 4 or even 6. 8 levels is to much to even consider winning.<P>And specifically ide like to point out the abuse of the dark team. I play a light and a dark, so this is unbiased here. but all the lights own and share every non dark piece of land. The darks own one small piece of land and cant venture to any other because they are swarmed with lights.<BR>Xteaming somehow needs to be controlled. Like not allowing multiclass guilds, not allowing healing of other races. You may be thinking then yopu are on the wrong server. no! I came on a team server, if they want to guild into multi team guilds then there needs to be a server for that. dont ruin the team concept by turning us blue through  Xteaming!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I forgot =)<P>please bring fear back. Fear was a great spell in pvp. Charm got out of hand because people would exploit it and have you attack guards and crap, but what was wrong with fear? I heard it turned you into an NPC so people , no matter what lvl, could kill you. Is this true? Please find a good way to bring it back and do so.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'll probably post more on other stuff like LoS and various other PvP exploits later, but I just wanted to voice one thing that I've noticed thats been going on on this thread.<P>The only reason I've seen crossteamers give for their raison d'etre is that they can't do 'ubermobs' or high level encounters as a single team.  <P>Well, last week my single team only guild killed/farmed Queen Velazul Di'Zok in Chardok, one of the hardest encounters in the game.  And from what I have just read, over 60 4-team crossteaming players on my same server entered Sebilis last night and failed to kill Trakanon.<P>The point is *not* to boast or relish in someone else's misfortune--on the contrary, we have failed attempts at the Queen before while the consortium of crossteamers have killed Trakanon before.  The point is that much of this high level PvE stuff is circumstantial, but it had been made abundantly clear to me that with quality players, good leadership, and a good plan, a single team *is* capable of doing just about everything (although this probably doesn't apply to Elf/Shorty teams in some cases).<P>It may just take a little longer.  But then that was the reason I understand people chose crossteaming--that it was the fastest path to do what *they* wanted, even if it was contradictory to the idea of 4-team PvP servers.<P>There are some 30 blue server servers.  If 'ubermobs' and high level encounters are *so* important to these people that they would stomp all over team-pvp (or just teams, period), why not offer them a /movelog off of the server?<P><BR>Aadrya<BR>Archmage and officer of Xanit K'Ven<BR>Vallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
