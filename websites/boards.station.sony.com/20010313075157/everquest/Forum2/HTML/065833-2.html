</FONT><HR>My own feeling is the mis-con on the mobs is where most of the problems come in.  The level 45 to 50 mobs(based on con), are often as difficult as level 55 mobs on Kunark because of damage output.<P>Look at the Kobolds in Velketor's.  They are level 47 to 52 according to con.  Yet they hit for 130 to 165 damage per hit(double attack).  This compared with the mobs in Karnor's Castle, which hit for only around 135 per hit, and have half the hit points.<P>This sort of mis-con also makes the reward not worth the risk in terms of XP gained.  The spiders just getting up to the Kobold area con green, yet hit harder and are more difficult than most of the blue con mobs from Kunark(to a level 52).  <P>This is the whole problem with Velious in general, it was DESIGNED with the warrior, rogue, cleric group in mind.  The need for casters in these encounters is lower because of it(the high damage output of the mobs makes casters die too quickly in most of these situations).  A balanced group of 6 level 50s should have a good chance of killing solo level 47 mobs, and a more difficult, but still survivable chance at killing 2 or 3 of these same level 47 mobs.  Instead, these have been tailored to be farmed by level 55+ groups.<P>Low blues shouldn't be the target of the 55+ crowd, but because of the poor game balance, low blues are the only things that most groups will risk for XP hunting.  That's pretty sad, and is why many people are leaving as soon as a good alternative comes out.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Until Verant gets around to allowing a set of groups to share experience, ANYTHING over 6 people is a "raid" by my definition.  I define a raid as: Expedition where you will lose more exp than you can possibly gain, and have little to no shot at anything worth your time.<P>The Planes (non-upgraded) are low-level raids.  Anything where 10-18 people are required is a small or medium raid.  Why does Verant show that they are perfectly capable of making good content for the 55+ crowd (Sebilis, Howling Stones, Chardok, parts of Kael, SS) and then make such utter CRAP for this same group in Velious?  <P>I'm probably what Abashi would have called a time-starved powergamer.  I like to see new zones and be part of fun raids.  The price of admission to a raid, though, (Especially for a monk, who pulls for her guild) is enough exp to still be viable when all those 4% exp losses really start adding up.  Which means I get to hang out in Sebilis or go to my favorite dungeon (HS) and GRRRRRIND away at the exp mill trying to get back what I lost in the last raid.<P>I've always felt that the uber-guilds weren't any better than the rest of EQ's guilds except for one thing -- a near military degree of organization.  The level of organization needed to keep 18-30 easily bored people focused and moving in the same direction long enough to accomplish something "epic".<P>The point of this whole, disorganized ramble is that I shouldn't have to spend all my time in one of two or three dungeons because all the others are designed for 10-18 people at a whack.  We need MORE content for the 55-60 crowd that can be accomplished with SIX people, or an exp sharing command between groups.  It may not be "epic" but it sure is what I and a lot of my friends are looking for.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There is really one ONE question that matters in this regard.<P><BR>I pose this to the original poster of this thread and all the troll since.<P>Have you fully explored ALL OF THE CONTENT appropriate to your current level?<P>In other words, is the 'excessive focus' you think you see on Uber mobs REALLY causing you problems, cause you have been every where and done everything and need new lands to explore?<BR>Or are you just complaining because some of the MANY zones you never bothered to go to are zones you feel excluded from?<P>Given how many high level (and mid level as well) zone, especially dungeons, are seldom used, I dont think you really have a reason to complain.<P>If these Uber zones were taken out of the game, you would still go to the same places and NOT go to many others.  So explain again just HOW the presence of ANY number of zones you cant get to is in any way detracting from your gaming experience.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Eduin wrote:<P>&gt;"Verant as a company seems to make decisions that are simple difficult to understand. But the post-Kunark decision to focus high end content to a tiny elite is perhaps the most strange."&lt;<P>I understand them just fine.  I'll try to make it clear to you.<P>&gt;"Let's just work from the numbers."&lt;<P>I'm already starting to see where the problem is.  Let's see how good your numbers are.<P>&gt;"In Kunark there was Veeshan's Peak. A zone which most players will never see. To even get there requires a guild organisation beyond most *players* although it is feasible for those who work at everquest."&lt;<P>I completely disagree that such organization is beyond most players.  I might agree that a lot of players won't want to spend the time that is needed to make that organization.  But I would strongly disagree with a statement that says, basically, that most EverQuest players are stupid.  That's a false statement.<P>&gt;"This wasn't *too* bad. If you just wanted to say "I've been there" there is a long term possibility of getting the key and entering the zone - of course getting out is another matter... <BR>At the time this was 1 zone amongts 50+. Still a significant proportion of content but not unbearably so."&lt;<P>Others pointed this out, but I'll do it too.  After Kunark was released there were over 100 zones available (I think it was 101).  So you are talking about 1% of the zones in the game.  And, well, Neriak is inaccessible to the player that doesn't want to play a Dark Elf, so what's your point?  Having only 1% of the zones be unique and difficult for the high level player actually seems pretty low to me.<P>&gt;"Then comes Velious. 15 or so new zones of which 2 are replicas (in terms of feasible access - PoM and Sleeper's Tomb) of Veeshan's Peak. Fully 13% of the content of an expansion that 7,500 people per server will be expected to buy and its tailored for a tiny minority of players. "&lt;<P>Right, sure…  Raising the total number of really hard zones to 3, that's less than 3% of the game's content…  And, well, PoM doesn't really belong on your list, but we'll leave it there anyhow.<P>&gt;"How many players?"&lt;<P>Depends on your definition.  How many of level high enough to be effective in those zones?  Or is it how many are interested or available enough to make the time and effort to get into those zones?  I'll admit that the second number is smaller than the first.  But you have no idea how many people are in the second group.  Nobody can know because it's not some number that we can yank off a server, it's a number of people in a group with a certain intent and desire, and you can't measure that.<P>&gt;"Well these zones are genuinely limited to a very few elite guilds - usually one per server maximum, which have a specific demographic - full time players. Judging by my knowledge of various servers and the sizes of these very few guilds, it appears that there are only 50 to 100 players per server who will *ever* see these zones."&lt;<P>Wrong.  That's might be the number of people that will see those zones this week or next.  But the roster on those guilds change.  New guilds form.  More and more players are getting characters to levels over 50.  Even if your number is right (and I really doubt it) for today, it will be too small tomorrow, and it will become less and less representative of the truth every day after.<P>&gt;"That's between 0.5% and 1% of the entire player base!"&lt;<P>Maybe.  And so your concern is that we have designed approximately 2.5% of the content to meet the needs of 1% of the population?  And that 1% is the group most likely to grow with the continued existence of EverQuest.  If your point is that perhaps we are not well enough prepared for the future, you might be right.  But if your point is that we've got too much high-end content, you're wrong.<P>&gt;"There is *nothing* between the Shroom King level mobs and the Dain level mobs. A huge gap where the *majority* of 55+ players play and yet there is no content designed for them."&lt;<P>You mean, like, a large chunk of Velious and Kunark?<P>&gt;"I play most of the game with a group of 10 to 18 people levels 52 to 60. There is *no* challenge in the game at this level range. I see *dozens* of other guilds out there on our server in very similar positions. <P>There is no possibility of such a guild arraying versus a Dain or Tormax yet there is no challenge in the rest of Velious, let alone the newbie grounds of Kunark."&lt;<P>Actually, there is a TON of possibility of those guilds fighting Tormax.  If there are *dozens* of guilds like yours, then there are certainly enough player resources for you to take on those challenges.  But we certainly can't force you to do it.  And if you just don't have the time or compunction to gather these guilds to fight a hard fight then you are not availing yourself of the content that IS available to you.  That's fine with me, but don't try to make it seem like that content is out of your reach, because it isn't.<P>&gt;"You know, that's just about the most idiotic statement anyone could have made in this thread. Don't worry, though, I truly pity you, cretin."&lt;<P>*sigh*<P>Angaar wrote:<P>&gt;"Wrong Panda, it was irrelevant because the point isn't whether it is 4.1 or 7.9 percent of the game is beyond the reach of most of the players - the point is that none of it should be out of reach."&lt;<P>It's not out of reach.  This is the common fallacy that people except as truth.  From Eduin's own example, there are plenty of players around that are available to help you deal with that content.  It's within your reach.  It's just as much in reach as Oggok is for a person that doesn't have the time or desire to play another character and start an Ogre.<P>Tieny wrote:<P>&gt;"Conclusion: If a zone is not designed so that a person can use it, that person will often complain. Regardless of whether the zone is usefull to other players or not."&lt;<P>That worries me too.  I don't think that more than a handful of people really do that.  But it worries me when people do.  We can't just wave a wand and make content.  It has to go out in pieces.  When we made Velious there was a woeful lack of high level content.  So we filled a need.  Warrens fills a specific need for those that play Erudites.  People should be able to see that and be at least somewhat pleased that we are seeing and filling these gaps.<P>Meleagar wrote:<P>&gt;"I not only agree with the poster, I'll go further. The BEST content in the game should NOT be limited to that which requires Uber-raids. There SHOULD be content that can only be taken down by an Uber-raid, but this should NOT be the BEST content."&lt;<P>What is the BEST content?  I really love Misty Thicket, it might be one of the best zones in the game.  BEST does not mean the hardest content.  How is it that Sleeper's is better than Guk?<P>Yes, Velious is very 'raid' oriented.  But you are forgetting all of Kunark, which is very much not raid oriented.  Looking at just Velious and trying to suggest that too much content is raid level is silly.  Look at all of Norrath when making that evaluation.<P>LetoII wrote:<P>&gt;"More troublesome is that nerfs have been put in because a tiny minority of players like those in FoH find some uber encounters easy. How did they decide after 2 YEARS that CH was overpowered?"&lt;<P>But we did not change complete heal at all.  Changes we make affect the area that we think holds the problem.  The breastplates that we changed were broken, regardless of whether FoH was using them or if you were using them.  If you had one, the change affected you.  What was broken about those breastplates has nothing to do with what encounter they were used against, but with the insane power of near-complete immunity to damage.  They were broken if used to kill 40th level NPCs without risk for experience gain, or if they were used to kill 60+ level NPCs with no risk for experience gain.<P>Miir…  thanks.  A good list, one that I was having trouble coming up with and didn't want to take the effort to make up.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The breastplates that we changed were broken, regardless of whether FoH was using them or if you were using them. If you<BR>had one, the change affected you. What was broken about those breastplates has nothing to do with what encounter they were used against, but with the insane power of near-complete immunity to damage. They were broken if used to kill 40th<BR>level NPCs without risk for experience gain, or if they were used to kill 60+ level NPCs with no risk for experience gain. /quote<BR>-------------------------------------------------<P>/BOGGLE  You didn't change CH?  huh?

It's still considerably more than it use to be though.  I'm waiting for more playtesting before saying it's still "broken", but the fact is that the aggro on CH was working the same way for 2 years.

THAT is what my previous post was referring to.  Yes, customers get angry about stuff like that.  <P>Just for the record, Absor, I'm inclined to agree with you that the way donal's bp was working originally may have been overpowered.  That's fine, but the BP changes are very minor compared to the healing aggro changes that effect everyone.  That is what I was referring to, not the BPs.  Now check my previous post about how abilities are being nerfed because a tiny, tiny percentage of players find encounters with the likes of Nagy/Vox/Trak to be easy.  The rest of us should not be nerfed because FoH and the like can slaughter Trak in their sleep.  For most of us hitting our 50's in level, these encounters were still very difficult and beating them something to be proud of.  It was bad to make a change that only makes them harder.  Challenge?

Never will be. I'm not an organizer. <P>Your grouping interface, xp sharing, etc. only supports a group of 6. Why is there content that requires multiple gropus at all? <P><BR>&gt;&gt;And if you just don't have the time or compunction to gather these guilds to fight a hard fight then you are not availing yourself of the content that IS available to you.

And if you can't see that then I know I have no future with this game. As I said above, trying to cat wrangle 30 people into all being in the same place at the same time and do what they're supposed to in the right order just sounds like a torture waiting for me in hell, not a game I'd play to unwind.<P>When you're designing new zones just remember: Not everyone wants to organize 30 people, or 12 people or organize anything more than themselves. Many people do not want to be a cog in a multi group raid. Be sure to make zones that are high level, yet pick up group friendly. <P>I've played pick up group style for the past 2 years and I like it. Phase out that style of play by only making content for multiple groups, then you're going to lose a few customers. And, no, restarting a new char is not really an option. Because I know they will eventually hit the same glass ceiling, so any enthusiasm is gone.<P><BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The changes we made to healing and hate generation had nothing at all to do with some activities of certain people.  And the changes only affected the level ranges and effects that they were aimed at (yes, a much broader range than those that were affected by the BP changes).  Your point was that we were somehow taking actions to affect a certain few people that were affecting the whole game.  That's plainly not true.  The healing thing was not done just because Complete Heal was broken, it was done because Hate calculation on all healing was broken.<P>Grimstaff wrote:<P>&gt;"Too bad Absor didn't comment on that.

Sure, there are some situations that we don't see until one person or group stumbles upon it.  But to imply that it is only one group that this happens with is completely false.  All sorts of people discover all sorts of problems.  We fix them when we hear about them.  And, well, here’s the real kicker.  If we 'nerf' something because someone was misusing it, it is that situation that we fix.  For the most part (and it's not always true), it is only the person that was misusing it that is affected.  Well, and those that were planning to misuse it once they got into a situation where they could.  Such changes don't usually affect the rest of the game population at all.<P>I know, your example would probably be the recent healing and hate change.  Nobody was 'abusing' it, really.  But every healer was 'using' the effects of the exceptionally low level of hate generated by healing.  And, therefore, every healer was somewhat affected by the change.<P>Trying to somehow suggest that the actions of a small group of people has caused us to harm the game for the whole is just wrong.  We never want to harm the game, that would be pretty silly.<P>zel45 wrote:<P>&gt;"So you think getting together 30 or so people to tackle Trakanaon is an equal task to making a newbie ogre? <BR>If someone just wants to see oggok, they can make a mule ogre and go on a tour. <BR>If someone wants to fight trak they've got to get together 30 or so people of the right classes. <BR>I see a great deal of difference or perhaps i just did not understand your comparison."&lt;<P>Different degree, but same issue.  I know people that just will never play a certain race.  Those people will, for reasons beyond my control, not be able to see some starting cities.  There are quests that people who never play evil characters will never get to see.  And there are places that people that won't organize a big group will not get to see.  All of that is beyond our control as a company.  We can't force you to want to create a large group to kill Trak, or an even larger group to kill the Dain.<P>There will always be some portion of the content of EverQuest that people won't see.

But not by any design restriction.  Only by the rules that you wish to play with, by your needs and desires.  I can't change those.  Nor would I want to.  But does that mean that we should never make content that you, as an individual, won't want to participate in?  Certainly not.<P>As for the volume of the content that is our of your personal reach, it is less than 3% of the game content.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A quick addendum to Absor, please realize that the intent of my original post in this thread was to point out where a large number of people were being nerfed because a tiny percentage (guilds like FoH) found some encounters very easy that should be hard.  Most of us, including me, still think beating the likes of Trak (or even Vox) is a great accomplishment.  The heal aggro change was a huge CH nerf and effected a huge number of people like me.  THAT is my concern.  It was working a certain way for 2 years, then suddenly it's considered "broken" and gets nerfed.  The cleric BP changes effect a small number of people (those who had this uber gear), so I'm not really concerned with those.  That's it, a fairly concise summary of my point from before... because of a select few, the game is made more difficult for many.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

For most of us hitting our 50's in level, these encounters were still very difficult and beating them something to be proud of. It was bad to make a change that only makes them harder. Challenge? Try pure frustration...<P>It's a matter of scale.  Naggy is easy.  We took him down with 18 last night.  Not 18 super equipt (I really need to pick up a froggy crown sometime).  People wearing crafted, FBSS's, wielding wurm slayers, using 2/5 ratio weapons, etc.  Just 18 sub 52.  Now, this was a guild effort, experienced players and 5 of the 18 were clerics.  With proper gear, a few more levels, a shaman for buffs, we could take him down with less still... or with less casualties.  My own personal goal is Vox with 12.  We'll see if that happens <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Going to try it, anyway.<P>Now, this is on the Rathe, one of the older servers.  We have a large post 50 player base.  We have 5 guilds that have killed Trakanon.  We have another 4 or 5 that could take him down if they wanted to.  When our split happens, 2 guilds that have killed Trakanon are moving.  Which means 3 or 4 of those that could take him but haven't yet will have that much more opportunity to do so.  On E'ci, they take Trakanon down in public raids.  Consider that...<P>That having been said, there are mobs that are nuts.  Mobs that I don't see people just walking over.  Mobs that are designed around a very low aggro CH.  The Vindicator in Kael, for instance.  These is no reason for him to be as tough as he is.  And there are quite a few other mobs that probably should be toned down a bit too.  Mind you... I say probably.  I haven't fought most of them and I can only go with what I've heard from others.  I have fought the Vindicator.  He hits too hard for what he is. <P>ToV... people will move in.  There will be enough guilds to utilize it.  Will they be able to kill the boss of the testing grounds?  I doubt it.  Probably another mob that needs to be toned down.<P>Is there content for a group or 2?  Yes.  Most of skyshrine except for the boss mob can be done by 2 groups.  Most of Kael can be done by very few.  Most of Icewell keep can be (and, by the way, RV armor needs to be level capped on who can wear it... armor that exceeds planar levels should not be available in a wide open zone where newbies start out non-KoS in).  Much of the old world can be done with very few.  Seb Spore king?  With the right group, easy.  Without a perfect group, very doable.  Prince in Chardok can be done with 1 group.  Korocust can be done with 1 group.  Much of Velkator's Labrynth.<P>You'd really be surprised how much you can do with 1 well balanced group... a group with a shaman, a rogue, a tank, a cleric, an enchanter, and a whatever.  But most people don't try.  And then they come here and complain.<P>Those same people call FoH quitters.  Kind of sad... they come here and call FoH names for having done the stuff they can't do and then quitting because it isn't fun... and then come out and call for those things to be changed.  Ah well, enough rambling.<P>I'll just leave it with this:<P>We all want to do the newest things... but most of us have to wait quite a while before we grow into them.<P>Axterix En'Obelix<BR>Dark Breed of Norrath<BR>The Rathe<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

That does not exist in Velious.<P>Even those *tiny* number of encounters which might offer a challenge to 10 to 18 people are generally *very* specific in the classes required - if your healers are a mix of Cleric and Shaman and Druid that doesn't work.  If your tanks have some Hybrids that doesn't work.<P>The examples you gave are almost entirely single group encoutners which become a boring farm with more than one group and scale from that challenge for 6 people to a requirement for 30+.

</FONT><HR>Miir exactly what DOES entitle you to see and enjoy a game if paying for it is not the answer?  Being a big enough d00d and being in the right guild?  That is the silliest thing I have read so far today.<P>"Trying to somehow suggest that the actions of a small group of people has caused us to harm the game for the whole is just wrong. We never want to harm the game, that would be pretty silly."<P>That's a false syllogism, to borrow a logic term.  You are stating that the only reason you would harm the game is from intent, and that is far from the case.  If that was the only reason, certainly it would be silly.  But you can harm the game without intending to, that is part of why you nerfed the CH breastplate - it was an item that damaged the game and you didn't intend it to.<P>The fact is, you HAVE made changes based on actions of a very few people and that has negative impact on the players as a whole who never even would have considered such a thing.  Building zones with creatures that have 2 million hit points has a horrendously damaging effect on many classes and players in the game.  This was  not because you were brainstorming one day, but as a direct result of realizing that the creatures you meant to be challenging weren't to a small, select group of people.  So you made them more so.<P>Lets take this further.  The planes are very challenging to the levels they were intended to be, and for most players.  But some people have a system down of emptying the planes and killing the 'gods' with more ease than you are comfortable with.  Your response as a company is to increase the planes in difficulty until now the intended level range is totally shut out.<P>People who don't own Kunark are suddenly unable to ever go to the planes.  This is a decision based on the actions of the few that detrimentally affects the many.  Did you MEAN to harm the game?  In no way.  But you have, and will continue to, as long as you respond to a VERY FEW people's actions and achievements.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Thanks Grim, that's exactly what I'm talking about.  A tiny percentage of players now find part of the game easy that Verant wants to be difficult, so they make the mobs harder (e.g. the planes) or they nerf the players (e.g. the heal aggro) to make the encounters more difficult.  I was straining for that carrot (planes, dragons, etc.) and I'd almost reached it, but then it's yanked away again.  Thanks Verant!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor wrote :-<BR>&lt;q&gt;<BR>I completely disagree that such organization is beyond most players. I might agree that a lot of players won't want to spend the time that is needed to make that organization. But I would strongly disagree with a statement that says, basically, that most EverQuest players are stupid. That's a false statement.<BR>&lt;/q&gt;<P>Absor, I am amazed.<P>I am amazed that you could possible believe you would get away with this sort of Ad Hominem attack to a justified post which seems to be gathering a majority of follow-up opinion.<P>Do you really believe that all your player base are 13 years of age?<P>Because thats the tactic you've just used.  In effect saying "hey, he's calling all you players stupid, don't believe what he's sayins".<P>Sorry, it won't work.<P>Here is the bottom line.  I could, if I wanted invest 16 hours a day, every day and get to participate in all the uber-mob raids I wanted to.  But I don't see why the game should require that level of commitment for *SO MUCH* content.  That's the problem.<P>That *is* beyond most players.  Not because they are "stupid" or "unskilled" but because the level of time investment is so high that they cannot and will not make that choice.  Its a rational outcome and I a, frankly, astounded that you can ignore that point completely.<P>&lt;q&gt;<BR>Wrong. That's might be the number of people that will see those zones this week or next. But the roster on those guilds change. New guilds form. More and more players are getting characters to levels over 50. Even if your number is right (and I really doubt it) for today, it will be too small tomorrow, and it will become less and less representative of the truth every day after.<BR>&lt;/q&gt;<P>/sigh<P>This is perhaps the most crushing thing I have ever read from a Verant employee.<P>To me, you are saying "we don't know our demographic".<P>Let me outline my opinion and you can, if so inclined, respond with your opinion as to why I am wrong.<P>The time and scale commitment of achieving these zones will never change.  If you aren't playing EQ for the majority of your day then you will not achieve the sort of raid experience and reward to key ST and VP.  The levelling requirement, raid requirement and equipment (camping) requirement are such that every player who will ever see those zones is required to be (more or less) a full time Everquest player.<P>This represents your demographic for these zones.<P>That demographic shares another trait.  They want to do these things *first*.  They have committed the majority of their time to EQ and want "fame" from their success.  They need to be the first to visit the zones or find new equipment either throughout the EQ community or on their server.<P>That is the reward for their commitment.<P>You are saying that a follow-up generation will infill these zones when the original set of players move on.  That *cannot* happen given the demographic.<P>The reward that this demographic wants is gone.  They can no longer be the first to get there on their server or in all EQ or the first to discover new items.  That opportunity is gone.<P>Therefore they will not make the time and lifestyle investment to achieve this.<P>This demographic need to make such a commitment of time and effort that they are *already* of the level to achieve this and they are *already* doing this.  The rest of your entire player base and its myriad demographics do not share this interest.<P>They will not be following up.<P>Unless you make those zones easier to achieve and play through in terms of both the numbers required and the time investment those players are required to make they will, like me, have *no* interest in going there not because they don't want more content but because that content is not even remotely attractive because of the genuine real life sacrifices required to enjoy it.<P>Regards,<BR>Eduin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Once again, a clear presentation of how the professional gamer's mindset creates communication problems with the casual gamer.<P>The professional gaming mentality (as demonstrated by Absor) isn't about understanding the casual gamer's point of view; it's about defending their own ground and territory.<P>Perhaps, being a professional gamer, and being part of a professional gaming "clique", he just doesn't understand that there are REAL differences between casual gaming and professional gaming.  He sees casual gamers merely in terms of "wannabe professional gamers" who just "choose NOT" to invest the time or effort necessary to conduct an "uber" encounter.<P>Ummmm .. that wasn't the point at all.<P>"Best content" is, of course, a relative term.  You can simply choose to avoid the issue by throwing out a diversionary commetns and say you find "Misty Thicket" some of the "best content", thereby camoflaging the fact that you know exactly what is being discussed.<P>What is being discussed is the core concept that certain content, which by and large most people consider to be some of the best graphics/items/quest components in the game, **should be** coded into "uber" encounters.<P>Claiming that this restricts no one from partaking of the content, because they **could** elect to spend more time in the game, and  that they **could** elect to invest the effort to organize such an event, has *****NOTHING***** to do with the point.  It is a diversion from it.<P>Should there be content directed for people that elect to organize and partake in such raids? Yes.  The question is, should that represent the "end game" top content OF the game?  Should the reward from that particular, chosen method of play grant be what is fairly universally considered the best?<P>My opinion is ...No.  For  a couple of reasons.<P><BR>1) There's no way to really moderate the difficulty of the uber encounter.  Uberguilds can simply amass more of the classes necessary to take a MOB down with much less difficulty and risk after a technique is found for killing it.<P>2) It's far more common that people have 2-3 hours to spend, and can put together one full group of players.  This would be well within the capability of your overall playerbase .. far more people are willing to do this than what an uber-encounter requires.  I'd say 90% or greater of your customer base is willing to "elect" to organize a 6-man team and spend 2-3 hours at one sitting.   <P>If the top end game was designed around "mini-zones" that were LIMITED to one 6-person group, and designed to be maximally hard for that group, then your "end game" would be "choice friendly" to 90%+ of your player base, not the current 5%.<P>Heck, you could find a PICK-UP group to try these mini-zone encounters.  This would generate great satisfaction for a much larger percentage of your customer base, realizing that they don't have to alter their lifestyle or natural gaming proclivities in order to partake, eventually, of the top-end content, the end-game, so to speak.<P>Before you say, "well, it still wouldn't make soloists happy" .. remember, 90%+ endgame participation/anticipation is better than 5%.<P>Before you say, "well, what about the uber-encounter, that won't make THEM happy..."<P>Why not?  THEY can still partake of, and probably be better at, the 6-man mini-zone just like everyone else can .. they don't have to alter their playstyle, because all we're talking about is time and organization.  It would just take less of what they do anyway to accomplsh a mini-zone raid.<P><BR>The more accessable you make the "end game" (without trying to avoid the issue or redefine it or disguise it), the more people in the game will be satisfied and play with greater anticipation that it won't take a miracle for them to participate in end-game content.<P>You could TRY to see our point of view, instead of avoiding it.<P>Which is what it seems you are doing.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A large part of all of EQ problems are people who like to complain for the lack of a better thing. <BR>They pay 10 bucks a month, and want a 500 dollar value out of it. <P>Listen, everybody thinks it is cool to complain about things even without really thinking about it. In school it is cool to complain that teachers, administration, and the staff suck. In real life, everybody always complain that the government suck, and now everquest sucks as well. <P>Well, in our society it is cool to be a rebel and complain. Me, me, me, me... <P>I think this is the case -- with EQ that is. <P>Hey, if you are complaining about too many high level zone (like Veeshan's, etc), and how many players will never see it, think about it again in an unselfish manner: are all players supposed to see all zones? If you want to go to a specific zone, work for it. Dont blame Verant for making zones like that where very few people be able to achieve that level. There are plenty of other zones I am sure you can play in. <P>You gotta be more stasfied with who you are (as a player) and what you do (playing). People complain about the full time players; I dont like them much myself, but hey, are you complaning because they are able to do/get more stuff and you feel like they shouldnt be ahead of you? If they put the time (even if too much time), they deserve to be ahead of you -- just like real life. I think that people that argue that point just have an ego problem and dont want anybody better than themselves. Reallity check, please. <P><BR>How about the people that complain that their class is not powerful enough? Well, read the paragraph above. If dont think your class is good enough (for you), go play something else. Hey, maybe shamans are not supposed to be such good healers after all, maybe you should use their strenghts differently! Who says that shamans have to be healers? Only those that had no healers around and blame verant for it (indirectly). <P>Have fun, it is a game! Sure, can be a serious one, but still is a game! I see all this flaming posts about verant sucking in customer service... Hey, how would you provide exceptional customer service for 350,000 players that pay 10 bucks a month? It is a business after all... And in any business transaction, if you dont think you are getting your money's worth, then stop doing business with verant. If you stay, you agree with the terms. Personally, I had in-game problems before, and, sure, it took me 20-30 one time to get GM help... But guess what, there are thousands of other people that needed the help at the same time... When there was a mandatory survey (When  you log on) about being willng to pay more for a special server with superior customer service, nobody voted for it, did they? Otherwise it would exist now. <P>So, bottom line 1: THE CUSTOMER ISNT ALWAYS RIGHT<P>Bottom Line 2: Lets stop being selfish and think about the macro perspective, which can be wayyyy bigger than you and I can think. Computer people could probably appreciate the work that goes into creating a structure like that. Not cheap. And then there is the business side to it: are you going to do it for free? <P>So, please, think before you jump on the bandwagon and complain. <P>Thanks!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>As simply as  possible ...<P>As a game designer, do you design your  game around your "average" player (by Verant's own statistics given out some time ago, this means weekday investments of about 2 and a half hours a night, more on weekends), or do you design it around your 5% fringes?<P>You don't design the game around the 5% who PvP ... nor the 5% that elect to pretty much do nothing but solo.  Should you design the game around the 5% willing to do an "uber" raid?<P>By  "design", I mean ... should the "uber" content provide anything exclusive or extreme as a reward?  Should SOLOING provide anything "uber" or extreme?  Should those playing  on the zeks have access to exclusive or extreme loot just because they choose to PvP?<P>What does "Design" mean in this context? It means that Everything of any consequence or required to accomplish for achievement of quest or maxing out character stats or equipment or ability is accomplishable by the target demographic.<P>The reason you design your game around your LARGEST demographic is to ensure the greatest satisfaction and client retention possible.  You include playstyle ALTERNATIVES in order to TRY to make non-mainstream demographics happy, but you don't DESIGN content that can only be attained EXCLUSIVELY by their playstyle.<P>90% of your players can pretty much form decent, full groups.  They can invest 2-3 hours at a time.  This is the target demographic.<P>Loot is a good example.  All loot and quest items should be DESIGNED to be attanable via reasonable single-party groups with 2-3 hours to invest at a sitting.  UBER events should just result in more QUANTITY of drops, not EXCLUSIVE drops.<P>For example, single group hunts and kills and gets 1 "uber" item from a hard encounter.  This item is from uber loot table "U".<P>If you can amass 40 people who have 8 hrs to invest in one sitting, then the "result" should be 5 random loot draws from loot table "U".  Hell, make it 7 drops just to reward the extra effort necessary.<P>Although those capable of Uber-encounters can get more faster (7 drops at once will always be faster than 5 separate shots each yielding 1 drop), the game is DESIGNED so that the AVERAGE player at  least has reasonable potential access to ESSENTIALLY everything those capable of "uberness" have access to.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I made a post a couple weeks ago that spoke about the constant "nerfs" Verant implements. More specifically I was referring to Necromancers as a class.<P>I do not need to refer back to my post, IF Verant even allowed it up onto the message boards..haven't checked, will in a moment.<P>My point is this -- I Agree -- Verant is smoking crack. This is not a Utopia. People do not get along perfectly. Lag IS a factor. Time, and time zones ARE a factor. Having a freaking LIFE OUTSIDE THE GAME, IS A FACTOR. I dropped Second Age. Why? They're an uber guild. I forget the monks name now but when this guy asked me for the 5th time who I was I just got pissed off and left. I'd been in the guild for about 6 months and yet nobody knew *** I was. Why? They're an uber guild / uber gamers / uber no-lifers. I do not spend my weekends camped out next to my computer just to hope and pray to god I make it out the same level as I am and MAYBE with an extra piece of planes armor.<P>Yeah, they didn't know me because I do not spend 20 hours on my Friday night. I do not take the damn day off of my JOB in order to make the 2pm EST launch of the raid into Kedge, or whatever. Why? It's a damn game!! <P>I agree, very, very, very strongly with the idea of this post. And to further my point as to why we need to be more powerful as individuals. This stems from my topic about necromancers.<P>Hey, Verant, you think you can make utopia a reality? Fine,  but give me the option to continue to solo, to continue to twink, to continue to play the game when *I* am ready to play. I can at least deal with being kept out of a zone or two, even though that idea is still a bit unnerving. That in itself is total bull as it is. <P>You guys at Verant are smart people but very, very, very stupid at the same time. Stop attempting to fix what isn't really broken. You know what, Ultima Online may not be as popular as it once was, people may complain about PvP or whatever. But guess what, IT'S STILL AROUND! Will Everquest in 2 more years? Will Verant ever get their heads out of their arse and create zones that people can actually play in?<P>Will Verant enable the GAME to be played as a GAME and not as a life long conquest?!<P>Judging by the posts I see time and time again it seems there are mature adults articulating ideas and pondering strategies for raids. Brain storming arguments to hand to Verant. Trying to intellectually justify why this and that should change.<P>I'm 22 years old. I'm a kid at heart, and not very mature. And DAMN proud of it. I will sum it up real easy..<P>Whatever the hell you are thinking, Absor, DON'T! In the 2 years I've played and the 100 days of real time I've spent online I would have to say there has been MAYBE 30% of the changes made actually helped US, the PLAYERS. The CUSTOMERS. Perhaps in some small way, perhaps fixing something that never worked to begin with like a spell. The rest has been utter crap.<P>The rest has been "fixes" that never amount to squat except striving for this utopian bull**** and how we should all get along and join hand in hand and go kill Cazic or whomever.<P>Enough Is Enough. Stop screwing up the game Absor/Dev Team/Microcrap/Big Brother/Who the hell ever is doing it.<P>I am appalled that I have come to these messages boards so much in the last 3 months to try to pitch my voice. This is a god damn game, do not make me feel like it's a presidential election.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm going to make this as simple as possible for you to understand.<P>When Everquest went live there were no feasible uber encounters. As a matter of fact that aspect of the game hadn't even been tuned. <P>This is a little known fact but the first Vox, before ANY tuning of her encounter, could now be killed by a level 60 warrior with a DRUID/SHAMAN healing. Do you see what I am getting at?<P>That first Vox I spoke of, however, took a collaboration of some 25-30 FoH guildmembers and 10-15 other non-guilded players to take down - this was 4 months after the initial release of Everquest. The levels of the players involved ranged from 32 to 50. This was the first real 'uber' encounter and would have no doubt been the focus of one of your childish, newbiesh rantings back 'in the day.'<P>But I digress...<P>Let's take your 'Shroom King' encounter. When Kunark was first released, this encounter required 3-4 groups. As gameplay progressed the encounter was widdled down to a warrior, a cleric, and a few other classes to expedite the process of farming the Shroom King. It sinking in yet?

Aradune once used a great example of a MUD he used to play and a certain encounter that was thought impossible when the MUD first went live and proved to be impossible when attempted - 6 months later the same encounter was routinely being done by a single player. <P>Now I'm quite certain you are in charge of a multi-million dollar company, Eduin. One that specifically deals with the end user in a massive multiplayer online gaming environment. One that deals with some 300,000+ users 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Actually, what the hell am I saying?? If you were in charge of such a company and made business decisions as aptly as you made design suggestions they would be bankrupt.<P>The point of this post is this: Tuning to your 'casual' lame duck groups, or even creating encounters tuned for said groups, ends up on the slaughtering table of psychotic young gaming addicts (like me, save yourself the trouble). Worse yet, lame duck groups end up farming said encounters 5 months later with two people and end up quitting because the game has become 'too easy,' 'not challenging,' etc... etc... etc... Meanwhile the pscyhos quit 3 months before that because they've plundered this joke of an encounter, tuned to the likes of you, five thousand times. Fun for all? yea right...<P>I'm done explaining. One thing, Eduin is a pariah on his home server. He cannot kill the mobs he so dearly wishes would fall before him and his band of casual gamers. This isn't a plea made by your everday philanthropist. This is a plea made by a malcontent that has ruined his reputation on his home server and isn't allowed to play with the other reindeer. Before you nominate him as the 'Hero,' of the casual gamer, I suggest you look into his motivation.<P>Thanks for your time.<P>Love,<BR>Mom<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You make it sound as if we just logged on the day we bought the game and became uber.  In order to reach where we are, we went through the same zones as you did.  We played the game when there was no plane of fear, when dragons were thought to be unkillable and reaching level 50 was an accomplishment only to see it turn into 115 players in lower guk and five guild shootouts for nagafen and vox 2 minutes after the servers came up after a patch.  We've done all of that already - wheras you still have a lot of things to look forward to.  For us, the game is not big enough.  That 3% of content is ALL that is left of this massive game for us to enjoy.  For you, there's still an aweful lot to experience.<P>Why is 13% of the expansion geared at 1% of the players?  Because the other 99% haven't already done everything else there is to do.  You're complaining about someone else getting extra dessert while you haven't even finished your meal.<P>Maybe what you are complaining about is loot.  That's usually what it's about - give me uber loot on a 18 non-uber person encounter.  Just don't be upset when a power gamer logs on a warrior and cleric on his second machine and takes it first.  (see lodizal)  Not his fault the mob was badly tuned.<P>Face it, this is just how it is.  Believe me, if you had been around for the patch day wars over nag/vox/pof, you would be THANKING verant for providing special content to keep the elite busy.  Do you really want to compete with US over your "causal" game content?  Think about that.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Veldra wrote :-<BR>&lt;q&gt;<BR>This is a little known fact but the first Vox, before ANY tuning of her encounter, could now be killed by a level 60 warrior with a DRUID/SHAMAN healing. Do you see what I am getting at?<BR>&lt;/q&gt;<P>Yes, you're building what is known as a "straw man" argument.  Its utterly irrelevant to the issue at hand.  We aren't talking about trivial encounters to FoH we are talking about challenging encounters for those without the massive amount of time investment required to organise on the FoH scale.<P>&lt;q&gt;<BR>That first Vox I spoke of, however, took a collaboration of some 25-30 FoH guildmembers and 10-15 other non-guilded players to take down - this was 4 months after the initial release of Everquest. The levels of the players involved ranged from 32 to 50. This was the first real 'uber' encounter and would have no doubt been the focus of one of your childish, newbiesh rantings back 'in the day.'<BR>&lt;/q&gt;<P>And it was *removed* from the rest of the player base with nothing to fill the gap.<P>Don't you see the problem here?  (Obviously not).  Vox was retuned *after* FoH had beaten her.  It became impossible for others to challenge Vox at the level FoH first challenged here.  It became impossible for others to challenge her with level 32 to 50 people.<P>They had *nothing* to replace the encounter, instead they had to drudge through additional levels and wait for their friends to reach that.<P>By this time Vox had been additionally enhanced meaning that only a very few on each server would initially be able to challenge her.  Meanwhile Foh - the *very* people Verant were *idiotically* balancing the encounter against, already had hte dragon drop gear with its massively enhanced Haste and resists and were still beating the encounter trivially.<P>See the problem.<P>Verant balanced the encounter versus those who were too far ahead of the curve.  They were never able to make the encounter challenging enough for FoH and at the same time removed the opportunity of *any* Epic encounter from those in smaller guild organisations.<P>&lt;q&gt;<BR>Let's take your 'Shroom King' encounter. When Kunark was first released, this encounter required 3-4 groups. As gameplay progressed the encounter was widdled down to a warrior, a cleric, and a few other classes to expedite the process of farming the Shroom King. It sinking in yet? (I'm probably even pushing it by including a cleric in that equation, and you will no doubt try to thump your chest and exclaim your prowess with Torpor - laf)<BR>&lt;/q&gt;<P>You assume that everyone has Warrior/Cleric combinations.<P>When I first did this encounter, it was a single group with an average level of 55.  When I last did this encounter it was with two gorups and an average level of 52.  People don't "all end up at 60" in the *GENERAL POPULATION* as they all ended up at 50.  The curve was changed with Kunark.<P>&lt;q&gt;<BR>Tuning mobs to 10-18 players is dangerous, plain and simple. Aradune once used a great example of a MUD he used to play and a certain encounter that was thought impossible when the MUD first went live and proved to be impossible when attempted - 6 months later the same encounter was routinely being done by a single player.<BR>&lt;/q&gt;<P>No, because your assumption is still that content should be tuned for the tiny elite.  When you retune the encounter (or design the encounter) for a tiny fraction of the population you remove that encounter from *everyone* else.<P>Forever.<P>Because once you first retune you always have to retune (or your entire argument falls down).  If encounters are always tuned for an elite few then the rest can never catch up because the elite few will continue to push the envelope and the encounters wil continue to be upgraded.<P>The alterative is to let a natural progression take place.  People move on past these encounters and they *remain* there for the next generation.  Not out of reach, not continually changing and upgraded.  But there when, after 12 months a less committed gamer reaches the *same* stage FoH were at the year before. <P>&lt;q&gt;<BR>The point of this post is this: Tuning to your 'casual' lame duck groups, or even creating encounters tuned for said groups, ends up on the slaughtering table of psychotic young gaming addicts (like me, save yourself the trouble).<BR>Worse yet, lame duck groups end up farming said encounters 5 months later with two people and end up quitting because the game has become 'too easy,' 'not challenging,' etc... etc... etc... Meanwhile the pscyhos quit 3 months before that because they've plundered this joke of an encounter, tuned to the likes of you, five thousand times. Fun for all? yea right...<BR>&lt;/q&gt;<P>No thats what happens when the *current* situation is enforced.  Content being removed from the realm of the non-24/7 player and nothing being created in its place.<P>The addict like you will get bored *long* before the mainstream gamer.  You are the ones that will quit and move on long before the average player even reaches the encounter.<P>Here's just one example - the Frenzied Ghoul/FBSS camp.  This is *exactly* the type of encounter you describe.  It can be a challenge to a group at level 40, trivial for a group at 50 and solo farmed by the right class and at 60 it would just be a farm for any solo.<P>But that *isn't* what happened.  The elite *moved on*.  Its fairly easy to get that spawn completely uncamped and for the low end of the Bell Curve, people who play a couple of hours a couple of days a week, they can get their challenging, L40 group encounter - their own "uber mob".<P>The same exact process was happening with the Planes of Hate and Fear before the Epic Quest requirements were (idiotically) added.  The elite had left these zones long behind and a challenge could be found for smaller guilds and more casual players.<P>(Of course Verant decided to drive the elite back there with the Epic Quests but thats just another example of them failing to understand their player demographics and design).<P>&lt;q&gt;<BR>I'm done explaining. One thing, Eduin is a pariah on his home server. He cannot kill the mobs he so dearly wishes would fall before him and his band of casual gamers. This isn't a plea made by your everday philanthropist. This is a plea made by a malcontent that has ruined his reputation on his home server and isn't allowed to play with the other reindeer. Before you nominate him as the 'Hero,' of the casual gamer, I suggest you look into his motivation.<BR>&lt;/q&gt;<P>I've killed every mob I want to kill and can be bothered killing.  My Monk and Shaman both have equipment in the top 1% of the server population and can be considered "uber".<P>But I don't play for loot, I play for challenging encounters and challenging encounters which fit the profile of the guild to which I belong.<P>If we were a minority, I could see Verant's point.<P>BUT WE ARE NOT!  We are the majority of gamers, we play evenings and weekends for various chunks fo time, we have 10 to 18 L50+ members and we want *challenges*.  We want mobs designed for us to encounter.<P>These mobs don't exist because of the focus on delivering content to the very tiny elite such as FoH which are an insignificant revenue stream for Verant.  We want these encounters redesigned to be removed as a challenge for massive uber-guilds and instituted as a challenge for a 10 to 18 player guild.<P>And if that makes the game boring for FoH and they leave, its no loss to the game.<P>Regards,<BR>Eduin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>My final word on the topic.<P>A player who spends 8 sequential 16 hour sessions on the game, should not (over that time) have been able to achieve any more than the player who plays 32 non-sequential 4 hour sessions.<P>The finely accoutred little princelings who make up the Uberguilds either have too much time or money on their hands, or they are professional deadbeats (aka game designers).<P>As Eduin (much as I have disagreed with him in the past) has repeatedly pointed out, the majority of the customer base simply do not have the time available to play 16 hour sessions.  The game should be tailored to the majority of the customer base, not some arrogant elitist little minority.<P>Sure the game should be about cooperation, but why then are so many obstacles placed in the way of cooperation.  Obstacles such as distance, and poor communication tools, and undue competition for specific spawns.<P>As someone pointed out, the grouping mechanism supports single groups of six players - no encounter in the game should require more than a single group of six players - either that or provide us with the communication tools we need.<P>If the majority of the customer base can only play in 4 hour chunks, then no encounter in the game should take longer than 4 hours to organise, get to, and complete.  <P>Our patronising compatriots from FoH seem to believe that this is their game, and we mere mortals are simply ill-tolerated guests.  Newsflash - without the financial support of us mere mortals, EQ would be down to a single server in fairly short order - populated entirely by Uberites.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065833-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065833.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065833-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065833-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065833-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065833-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=065833&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=065833&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
