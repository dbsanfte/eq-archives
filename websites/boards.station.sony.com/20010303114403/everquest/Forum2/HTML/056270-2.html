</FONT><HR>Hmm.<P>Problems I see : <P>1 - group need of a magician.  I think you said something along the lines of "our pets make us welcome enough".  Mmm.  What server are you on?<P>As a damage output device, we're okay, but how do we stand out?  You see a mage, you think "where's the pet?"  Perhaps we're the "warriors" of the robe.  What is it about a warrior that makes him desirable in a group?  Hps, taunt, and damage output.  I'd bet we're just fine on these.<P>The thing we're not fine on is control, and I'll bet pathing is the one thing that will give us the control we need to be welcome.  Btw, Dralnir is a good place to check pathing as well.<P>2 - soloing ability.  This is fine as far as I'm concerned, until about 50th or so.  After that, forget it.  I don't personally need to solo after that, but I'd like to have the option.  Problem is, I have to - because pathing makes my pet hazardous to the group I'd be with, I won't be getting many groups.  <P>3 - Epic quest.  I tend to agree with previous posters.  Do the math, guys.  Getting my staff from Inny is left-door to impossible.  Getting my other from Phinigel is somewhat easier, but still difficult.  Getting my cloak from Quillmane is just plain dumb.  I'm hearing rumor that some of this may have begun to change, and if so, thanks.  If not, do the work and get a magician up, pay some kid six bucks and hour and watch him sweat it out.<P>4 - useful summons.  Another thread.  Nm.<P>5 - Research.  I liked this.  It was a defining factor of a robe class.  I was particularly proud to have researched all my 49th pets.  I was particularly irritated to discover that this skill was worthless post-49.  Give me something to do with it, please.<P>6 - Spell drops.  I don't know just how common or uncommon these are, but I'd like to see something done to resolve the problems with this that others have faced in concert with #5, above.<P>7 - Please put an end to the pretense of knowing what's going on with Magicians.  In your initial post, you're talking about spells we don't have.  Blizzard?  Who's spell is that?  Pets make us welcome in groups?  When's the last time you heard someone say "Yeah, get that magician, we sure could use his pet."  Get some product knowledge under your belt, please.  <P>I know it's a big game, but if you claim to have folks who have played magicians to a high level, please consult with them prior to coming out here and attempting to address our issues.  Otherwise, don't waste my time.  Your seeming lack of grounding with this class makes me wonder whether you'll be even capable of recognizing legitimate issues.  I appreciate your coming out here and making this effort, but it will do nothing but make problems worse if you come out here thinking we're wizards, shamans, or something else.<P>Thanks - <P>  T<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Well where's my extra convience ?? <BR>Where's my summon something worth using by a mage ?? <BR>How about summon something worth using by anyone that doesnt already have everyone of my other summons you know all the convient ones ??<BR>summon something worth giving to my pet ohh oh muzzle to bad there are only 3 damn copies on my entire server TY for making it NEVER drop !!<BR>lv 56 spell dropping off lv 57+ mobs TY for the forsight maybe next time im lv 56 I will remember that I have to kill yellow/red cons to get my spells.<P>9) Current Spells<BR>Shard of the core how about raising the lv to 39 instead of 34 and dropping the no drop tag maybe making it +10 to all stats instead of 15cr 15pr so it could at least be considered as a normal summon for everyday life.<P>Summon Weapons - worthless - only dagger of symbol's and spear of warding are ever going to be used and that's only for the save's they carry to give to pet's how about some upgrade's ??<P>SoR - nerf/fix I dont care, I do remember that the SoR prot was called a CLASS BENEFIT a bonus for being a mage something we can bring to the group and add if thier are other's pet's around and also something I really liked you all knew how much extra dmg SoR's did and many mage's underestimated them but now that they are gone everything from pet's seeming less powerfull to out rights calling that pet's were nerf'd has happened and its all because mage's are power in fast killing and now with SoR's out of the equation of power pet's die faster because mobs are dieing alot slower and mage's have no way to keep our pet's alive during that extra time our nuke's suck - healing lv 20 spell &lt;== worthless 220 heal on a pet taking 400-500 dmg in the time it takes to cast. no defensive abilities <P>some new weapons summons for pet's are needed<P>A spell I would like looked into<P>Mala Magician lv 60 350 mana 35 debuff pr/fr/cr/mr<BR>Malo Shaman lv 60 350 mana 45 debuff pr/fr/cr/mr<P>we go through our entire live's with this line being behind shaman's but when we do finally do get it its not a gimped version, its the same mana for the same effect.<BR>Now I realize that we should not get the same spell at lv 60 it would be nice to at least not have our cost the same mana and do less effect a small chance in mana cost is needed<P>say<BR>Mala Magician 60 300mana 35mr/fr/cr/pr<P>Impossible to get !!<P>Muzzle of Mardu lv 56 spell<BR>Too bad it only drop's off jugg's in sebilis mobs that are ~lv 57+ this spell needs its location changed to a place a 56th mage might actually have a chance to go and have its drop rate increased I personally know of 3 copies on my server and know easily about 15 56+ mage's as freinds and have talked with tons of other 56+ mage's that also dont have this spell. <P>maybe a lower lv version of muzzle for pre 50 crowd would be nice as well I never did understand why necro get thier 49-55% haste pet buff at 39 while mages at this lv are still and will still be using bo2 which is only 35% haste for another 10 lv till 49th a muzzle clone at 39th with 14% haste and maybe some stats would bring the two main pet class's order and give us higher lv mage's with no hope of ever getting muzzle something to give our's and other people's pet's<P>lv 39 Leash of Mardu<BR>~14% haste 5ac 5str 5 agi 5dex 5sta<P>and a small change to muzzle itself<BR>lv 56 Muzzle of Mardu<BR>~25% haste 10ac 10str 10agi 10dex 10sta<P>these are perma buff's at least them them actually buff the pet as well as a little extra haste.<P>10) personally I think it would be great if we have disc's for pet's like some of the ones mobs use enrage ....... not a spell a command used teh same as disc's<BR>/pet disc &lt;checks disc available&gt;<BR>/pet enrage 100% repost 11 sec's recycle 30mins<BR>/pet defensive 50% dmg taken 1 min recycle 15mins<BR>/pet aggressive dmg x 1.5 20 sec's recycle 30mins<BR>(60dmg pet start's hitting for 90dmg)<P>something fun we could use on raid's against boss's or just in normal tight fight's to keep our group's alive.<P>I dont think this last one would be too hard to implement by giving the mage's the disc timer on a pet command - so its a pet command we only have access to every recycle period.<P>Aredune 60 Magician<BR>Audara 54 Necromancer<BR>Saiden 53 Wizard<BR>Efreet 52 Ranger<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor have you even played a mage, let alone played one to post 50th level?  This class is in desperate need of an identity.  Post 50 mages are now obsolete.  Our strength (pets) are now our weakness.  I cannot tell you how many times I have heard  the words “no pets please”.  Let’s face the facts, a mage without his pet is ineffective at low to mid levels.  Post 50 a mage without his pet is almost useless.<P>Issue #1:  Pets post 50<BR>Our pets do not grow in strength in comparison to equivalent mobs of the same level.  With the introduction of Kunark and Velious we are easily outmatched. What in god’s name were you thinking changing our best pet type, fire, into a wizard.  A wizard that melees no less!  Please change it back please. Our pets are almost useless vs. mobs that aoe fear.  I see that we have a spell on test for pet immunity to fear at 59th level.  Gee I guess we don’t get to use a pet against Sev, let alone Naggy and Vox unless your 59th level?  Oh yeah 52nd level is max for Naggy/Vox forgot. <P>Issue #2:  Pathing <BR>Terrible pathing makes it impossible for mages to utilize their pets in way too many places.  Basically if your not in an outdoor wide open zone or camping a room/spot your not getting a pet. Especially at post 50 when one mistake means big CR issues. What more can be said?  Fix the pathing of zones or find away to make pets viable in these zones by maybe having the warp to your side when the travel a certain distance away.<P>Issue #3 Resistance to Mage Spells<BR>This a very frustrating problem.  Our resists are way too high.  The malise line of spells is supposed to be one of our most useful lines of spells.  But what is the point when all you can malise/malisement/malosie are blue mobs?  I can’t get this to stick on even cons or higher.  And with the introduction of 100% MR mobs our usefullness is diminished even further.  So mages need to wait till 60th lvl to land a resistance debuff on any kind of epic/boss/dragon mob.  This really needs to be rethinked.<P>Issue #4 Conjurations<BR>All of our summon spells have been given to items and/or other classes as well for the most part.  To be honest we never had any great summon spells to begin with besides CotH.  Is this the defining area or our class.  I am a conjuror, yay I can make beer, throwing daggers, and cake at 57th level.  This is a joke.  The summons spell lines are laughable with the exception of our pets and CotH.  This needs to be addressed.<P>Absor thank you for your time. <P>Aandiwen Arkana<BR>Mage of the 57th Circle<BR>Requiem Despair <BR>Torvonnilous<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If Mages were given theses three spells then we would be able to get have a better chance to live without a pet at our side, allow us to have a special ability as other classes do.. such as clarity and sow, and make us attractive to groups as well.<BR>1) Intention...lev 14 self only..45 mana cost..15 min duration <BR>2) Focused Intention...lev 34 target..125 mana cost..25 min duration <BR>3) Group Intention...lev52..375 mana cost..20min duration<P>When this line of spell is casted it allows target to follow through on any spell they cast without fizzle or interuption and with the full intent  of the spell outcome intact(ie)no resistance from target or failure of the spell.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor, Thank you for starting the Magician Talk thread. I have some more questions and things to add to this thread. Magicians have issues besides the ones you have listed and knowing Magicians they will list them in this thread, so please have some patience.<P><BR>-= Pets, soloing and want of a Mage: =- <P>The higher level you go the worse we solo and with greater difficulty then the other solo classes. Soloing does not a class make.<P>Root, Snare, Mez, Stun, Darkness, Fear, Divine Aura, Feign Death, etc... I am curious why magicians do not get at least one of these lines of spells? We have been told in the past that it was because we have pets. Yet now there are many many pet classes, some with pets close to ours, yet that is really irrelevant. There used to be just necromancers and magicians and i belive enchanters with pets. Here is a list of all the pet summoning classes i could find:<P>Magician: Elementals (Air Earth Fire Water)<BR>Necromancers: Skeletons, Specters<BR>Enchanters: Animations<BR>Shadow Knights: Skeletons<BR>Shamans: Wolves<BR>Druids: Bears<BR>Clerics: Hammer of Faith<BR>Wizards: Flaming Sword Defender<P>This leaves Warrior, Rogue, Bard, Monk, Ranger and Paladin without pets. There are now more pet classes then not and most of them have one of the listed lines if not more. Why do we not get one of these lines and why did the Necromancers get a few of them? DONT NERF the Necromancers! Thanks. I would like to know how this would overpower us any differently then these spells being used by the other pet classes? This has been chewing at me for some time  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>We just die so easy to greens when crossing zones and no Magician summons a companion every time they zone. A short stun would be good. We also can't fight more then one mob at a time and they usually come in groups. We don't kite, we duke it out.<P>How about the second gate and bind point option for magicians only? Gate IS our only escape. In Erudin we are called GateCallers. This would re-affirm that title  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>-= Phantom Armor: =-<P>I personally DO care that i can not remove the cleric buff that overwrites our line and that it overwrites our line  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">. Please make them stack instead. Here is a cost breakdown and number of Components used for the armor and equivalent other components.<P>Phantom Leather: Cat's eye agate 1 (2g, 3s) no change<BR>Phantom Chain: Cat's eye agate 2 (4g, 6s) to Bloodstone (5g, 7s, 6c)<BR>Phantom Plate: Cat's eye agate 3 (6g, 9s) to Bloodstone (5g, 7s, 6c)<BR>Phantom Armor: Cat's eye agate 4 (9g, 2s) to Carneliean (9g, 7s, 9c)<P>A new look would also be nice like some sort of Transparent Mail over our character that might take on the color of whatever robe we are wearing or something. There is an idea that if you don't like the look you could just requip your robe to change your look back, thats a good idea too.<P>-= Pet Health & Other Pet Things: =-<P>Yes this would be great but remeber to keep them mana efficient or we would just summon another pet. Now a CH for a pet at 2x a pets casting cost would probably be cast ;p<P>Pet Healt Bar is a FANTASTIC Idea, Yellow bar in our red health would be good or something.<P>The pets health doesnt scale up with the new lands of Kunars and expecially Velious. How about a bonus to their Health when summoned here?<P>The Change to Pet Report Health to Pet Say Health and have Jobrabar says 50% health Master so everyone can hear it OR add this as a new command OR onto the old one like /pet report health loud<P>/pet no attack or /pet no aggro. This would help with pet control, make magicians, parties and enchanters happy/ <P><BR>Make the spell that calls your pet back to you if not aggro a command? /pet Appear<P>Pet Buffs, can we have some sort of other buffs besides Burnout (Str and ac and att iirc)<BR>Pet Regen spell, Pet Resists Spell, Pet get me a beer spell  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> just kidding.<P>Let us Buff others Pets with these new spells.<P>Meraxes_Glibilskym Has an EXTREMLY IMPORTANT POINT about socials and pets (I'm Pasting it here for you) As a magician all of our 'commands' for pets are hotkeyed to socials, yet when we use any item, our robe, leggs, or other 'charged' item with a casting time we cannot control our pets via socials. Suggestion would be to place "PET COMMAND" keys simular to spell icons so that we can use those during 'click' items, most of ours have cast times near the 10 second mark (Robe, Epic, Burnt staff, legs, etc..) <P>OR make socials clickable while casting or at least the keyboard equivelant (thats from me)<P>Chat Filter: Please seperate our pets hits from general hits and make it on/off<P><BR>-= Pet Fun: =-<P>Voice Graft Please! or a /pet say ......... command.  <P>A new Look for higher level pets. I would like to see the Air Elemental Lady from the PoS become a post 50 pet look. Every Magician deserves a beautiful assistant! <P>Pet names is a neat idea, though the option to go back to your random pet names should be part of that. Perhaps a /pet name on and you get to type in your pets name.<P>-= Summoned Beasties and the Magician =-<P>Ward Summoned Line:<BR>Many good points brought up by my fellow Mages, one thing also is they are LESS mana efficient then our nukes and are usable in very few situations. The casting time difference is no real advantage.<P>Please consider a whole line for summoned things, Invisbility to Summoned, Charm summoned, Fear Summoned. ShaggyHippie has an excellent list of others in this thread.<P>There are many roleplay and gameplay excuses for why we should get these lines of spells. We are the Master of Summoning Things. What you summon you need to controll. You would learn all you could about summoned creatures and things, how they function, where they come from so you can call them, how to call them to you, how to protect yourself from them, how to banish them, how to control them, how to look like them and assume their attributs, etc..<P>-= Spell effects and Items =-<P>I would like to know why there seems to be little problem with passing Magician summons onto a variety of items that other classes can use? This just weakens the want of a Magician at all.<BR>People can get items that summon food, water, bandages, arrows, throwing daggers, Pouch of quellious, just to name a few.<P>SoR was not a nerf and we know it. We would like a few different summoned weapons with some comparable procs that ramp up with level of said summon spell. Like a 20dd at 24 and a 40 dd at 39 etc..<P>Others have covered Summons and lack of use of most of them and you have that link to the early summary I put online so.... next subject.<P>Cramming spells into the post 50 slots, This just stinks. There is a whole community of yet to be 50 Magicians that have just as many problems as the post 50's do. Please make many of these spells under L50 and move some of the "fun" ones down like Gift of Xev, and Bristlebanes Bundle. I think the levels on test are good execpt the pet fear resist spell, should be about 49.<P>-= DoTs =-<P>I like the idea of a magic based DoT, but the efficiency is terrible compared to any other DoT. The ticks have a chance of interrupting casters so the minor stun-ish effect is nice. If these are removed or changed into a new spell will we just trade in the scroll if we have not memmed it? Will they just show up in our book if we have memmed it? Will you reimburst us the high ammount of plat if they just poof?<P>-= Conjuration & Evocation =-<P>Please make ALL shock like conjuration.<BR>Please add another shock at Level 34 or perhaps 39. This is how it stands now.<P>Level 24: Shock of Spikes  Mana: 110  Damage: 158-176<BR>Level 44: Shock of Swords  Mana: 250  Damage: 580<P>This is 20 levels without another shock line, in these levels you run into alot of fire creatures, like in Sol A. Please add another shock like: Of course numbers are up to you  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Level 34/39: Shock of Knives  Mana: 190  Damage: 325 <P>OR perhaps 2 new ones one at 29 where we get no new DD at all of any type and another at 39 seeing as we get bolt and dd at 34. <P>Absor one minor point in the Grimstaff thread on rains you mention Magicians getting dd's at 29, we don't. The examples you used were Wizard spells  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> heh  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>-= Elemental Form =-<P>We have been pleading for this for some time. As was pointed out Druids turn into wolves, Necromancers turn into skeletons, Shamans turn into bears, Magicians should turn into Elementals. We are closely tied to summoned beings and the elements in general.<P>-= Research & Drops =-<P>Been Said, chain research is pure evil and we are the ONLY casters who have to do it.<BR>Our Spells are dropping off inappropriate level mobs, like the 39 spell on 50 mobs.<BR>The spell drops are way too rare.<P>-= Misc Stuff =-<P>Elemental Staff of Fire Mastery: Is this even in the game?<P>Epic Quest: you know the problems  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Mana regen, been mentioned, you know it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Stored mana before and use later is the way to go  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> but not No Rent.<P>Eye of Zomm, Longer duration and allow with a pet already up please.<P>Maliase is resisted alot!<P>Perhaps we could get the rune line? Kaltair said it well in his post.<P>Give enchanters the /pet attack /pet back off or /pet get lost commands. They need it.<P>Here is that link to a ton of cool spell ideas and other old issues from July 2000<BR>http://members.nbci.com/Imaginos9/<BR>(I like the first few fun spells alot  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  )<P><BR>Thanks for Taking The Time Absor<P>Veldin DarkFire<BR>L 41 Magician<BR>Rodcet Nife<P>P.S. Teramenor quit trolling. Like 20 hp makes a diff in the L20 heal when your pet has 1600 hp or more. Perhaps you were so good at running away because you have a high agility which NOT ALL MAGES have. Get a grip.<P>javafiend: Because of the flexibility of your pets and the spells that they can cast. A mage could root and nuke while having a tank that hits and nukes as well. A tad overbalancing.<P>No more overbalancing then a necromancer doing Darkness/Fear/Root and siccing pet or any of the other pet classes i listed above. Same difference really. Nice spell idea though.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Just wanted to say I think these "class talk" things are going well, kudos to whoever thought of the idea. I've made a summary of Mage issues and given my opinions/ideas on them, be warned, it's long. Also, keep in mind that I wrote this shortly before the Mage Talk thread was posted so I know I overlap a bit onto what you have said:<P><BR>1) The Epic Quest and Epic Quest pet: First and foremost, on a purely cosmetic level, our epic quest should summon a pet with our name, for example "Deelit's Pet" or something. Necros got to look like spectres, we should get a named pet. It takes us months to finish this quest, it will take all of 15 minutes to program, please.<BR> <BR>As for the quest itself I would say it is the most difficult of all classes, but not insane with one exception, the Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth, from Innoruuk. It's not the difficulty, it's the obsene rarity. If you assume an average of 70 Inny's a year (Once per week plus patches and whatnot) and the fact he drops the staff about 10% of the time that means a server gets a staff every 52 days. Now if you assume only 3 guilds do Inny and you are one of 2 mages in your guild (this is VERY favorable, since often there are 6-10 guilds that do inny and you often have several mages in guild) then you will get a staff, on average, in 312 days. If you apply real-world numbers (say 6 guilds on bertox and me being one of 4 mages in guild of the appropriate level) I'm looking at 1251 days or 3.43 years to get one, on average. The Rogue quest was done in one week, it's limiting factor is a mob which pops every half hour. This inequity (which exists for wizzies too, and other classes that require god drops) is unfair. The other thing you will hear most mages complain about is Quillmane's Cloak. This is rather sad too, so I am going to do what any smart person would and pay to multiquest it. I know that wasn't the spirit you made the quest in, so you might want to change it. If not, I got money, doesn't matter to me :P<P><BR>Possible solutions: A level 53 mob or something should be added to hate, which drops the earth staff every time killed. Earth staff should be removed from Inny's loot table. Thus less risk, less reward for other classes (who can choose not to attack it) or more risk more reward for mages. As for cloak, I'd suggest either making it not no drop (but that doesn't really solve the "Questing" issue), or adding a mob (perhaps to Rathe Mountains) which is very high level but doesn't wander or agro and drops cloak as common. Quillmane's dad so to speak. At the very least, Quillmane should be checked as a summoned mob, so mages can track for her using sense summoned, it's ludicrous to expect mages to do that camp versus druids. Is it logical to turn her summoned? No, but then neither is the concept of a flying horse.<P><BR>Also, I hate to burst the bubble of Gordon and Your writings and just about every GM I've talked to in chat and in game, but the epic pet isn't that good. It can solo a low level kunark blue...but the quest is so difficult 99% of mages are 60 by completion anyway, it's utily there is useless. Otherwise it fails from the same pathing and AI problems as other pets. Other classes get raid items, ressing, haste etc, mages got a solo item at a point where EXP doesn't matter anymore. In raid situations this pet deals marginally more damage than earth.<P><BR>Possible solution: Determine how much pet is hit in relation to how much it hits when soloing, say it connects 3 times for every 2 it is hit. Reduce or remove the large damage shield (which I admit is cool but useless on raids, when your pet is unlikely to get hit) and add that damage to the melee damage of pet (For example, if you find pet hits vs. hits taken is 1:1, then you can reduce the damage shield to 30pts and bring melee max to 97, this makes pet no more powerful solo but more useful in a raid) We have the hardest epic, and while I don't deny I would use the epic pet over any other, we should get something more beneficial to a raid.<P><BR>2) The Experience Penalty: Currently Mages are the only ones with an experience penalty. No I'm serious. When we solo if our pet does more than 50% damage we take half exp. In a group our pet takes exp. This is also unfair. You don't incur a penalty for swinging a sword as a warrior, nor casting spells as a wizzie, how come I incur a penalty for using my pet? You can't say it's an anti-soloing measure, because druids don't receieve a penalty for kiting, even 50+ wizzies don't recieve a penalty for root and nuke. You can't possibly argue that a high level mage can solo without a pet to root a mob, so either make all classes lose 50% while soloing or take our loss away.<P><BR>Possible solutions: Not one to nerf others when I can avoid it, remove this illogical, unfair burden.<P><BR>3) Support Spells and Summoned Items: Summoned items need to stay when we camp. Nothing like making a pet, gift of xev, mod rod, and going ld. I wholeheartedly agree that if we give items to another class they should go poof (can't have infinite food/water) but there needs to be a workaround here. <P>Mages need to get improved invis. Every other class with invis got improved invis, wizards even got invis to undead. After 60 levels any person could get this variable thing down.<P>Above all (And this is something I KNOW you'll agree with) stop putting summon effects on every item ever, quit farming out our class ability. I can make water and food...but so can bards and clerics. I can make bandages, but so can every tank who has ever fought in the Tower of Frozen Shadow (which is a 35ish dungeon), and all the cool stuff I could summon was put on class specific armor (from arrows to throwing daggers). It's to the point where we are useless as item summoners. All you need to do is farm out Mod Rod and we'll be totally useless. You even put our Level 54 summon spell effect on a PoG Monk Bracer!!! There are monks, right now, who are lower level than mages who can cast OUR spell! No 55 spell should EVER go to another class as an item effect, and CERTAINLY not a pure tank. While we are on the issue, what is with Reclaim Energy being put on Thurgadin Quest Bracer? If I don't have it on one of my 3 mastery staffs, or my 4 sol ro focus items, or half a dozen other assorted mage items, or don't feel like, ya know, scribing it and casting it for virtually no mana, I can use this bracer, which has a casting time, making it worse than our sol ro focus effect from 20 levels ago. Why does the monk bracer have a 54 mage spell and my bracer has a level 1 spell? You should replace it, I'm looking for something in an enchanter clarity or stun line, or perhaps a mid-level cleric heal. Yeah, it does sound stupid to toss away class abilities like that.<P>The magician summoned weapons always have, and probably always will, suck. They're counter-intuitive to the game.<P><BR>Possible solutions: NO RENT items summoned by mages should stay after camping if held by a mage. That way mages can only twink other mages, and we can't even twink em with anything (what, they'll get a free staff and a mod rod, which would kill them anyway). And yes, our bags should stay too. Maybe we unfairly save a penny by not having to by a bag of the tinkerer's, but it's nothing compared to how enchanters clean up with jewelry. Mage summoned items need to be discontinued from appearing on armor, both other classes (which makes us useless) and our own (which makes the effect useless). The Monk bracer, and similar items which have yet to be found need to be (yes I hate to say it) nerfed. It's just completely unfair to keep that on there. Reclaim energy on our bracer is an insult. If you won't replace it with a spell we'd use commonly, feel free to replace it with Burst of Flame, our level 1 dd, that way I can pull greenies in Lower Guk without spending mana. Summoned weapons need to become more powerful with levels (like any other spell) and need to include more devasting proc effects which only proc for high levels, so every now and then a tank with bad equipment will actually want to have me cast one of my main lines of spells.<P><BR>4) DDs and Offensive Spells: The Malise line should never had been made for mages. The Elemental Maelstrom dots should never had been made (If we expect a long fight we'd chain cast pets, not use this dot stuff, we can't reverse kite or even normal kite). Not asking for anything, just reminding you, I know hindsight is 20/20. I was going to suggest a small inherent resistance debuff (like wizards get) for epic mobs only, but you beat me to the punch with the anti-pet fear spell. Yeah, we're useful against dragons! I don't know what you're going to hear about this, but things are good on this front, in fact, if you're going to nerf us in one area to balance out another, you should nerf this one.<P><BR>5) Damage Shields: Is there some sort of technical reason the shield damage isn't tallied for me? I don't know if I'm really for any change here or not. If the damage gets tallied to me, I run the risk of taking a faction hit while being a non-kos buffer in PoG but then I earn a lot more exp for my group and I by damage shielding people during raids.<P><BR>Possible Solution: Please look into this issue. If you can work it out either way, then before choosing an arbitrary solution, ask the mage community.<P><BR>6) Lack Of Mana Regen: It's serious, really it is. Go into Chardok, see the pathing? Now feel like half a wizard for about 8hrs while doing king, then go back tomorrow and repeat with queen. Rinse and repeat for prince. Why can you put regen on like 5 different tank armor pieces and not put clarity on one magician thing? (Think back to the Thurgadin quest bracer) If you're making the policy of giving class spells out to other classes, how about the mages be beneficiaries too. I don't get the group friendlyness of evacs or unresistable damage like wizzies do, yet they solo more effectively 50-60 than I do, and the reason is mana regen. Try it, solo a mage or a wizzie in karnors and see who gets to 60 first.<P><BR>Possible Solutions: Magicians NEED an inherent form of mana regen. The other pure casters have it and we rely on mana as much as they do. And yes you must draw a distinction between wis and int casters, since wis casters convert mana into hp for tanks while int casters covert mana into much less reliable and efficient dds. (Try efficency of ch versus ice comet or another dd. Does a tank or the wiz deal more damage from that mana) I suggest something with recurring drawbacks like necros rather than a one-shot drawback of wizzies, since it is obvious you don't want to give it to us.<P><BR>7) Aegis of Ro: It's a small small facet, but this spell needs to have a higher drop rate. It's more of a good-faith issue. In all fairness, it's difficult to respect someone who won't fess up that they were wrong, and you tried to dodge the bullet on this one with "Well technically it's a new spell, just because it's in the sp.dat file doesn't mean it is in game." Please! It's obvious this spell was meant to go in with kunark's release, but because you guys don't test or don't listen or don't care about mages or maybe because it just slipped thru the cracks you missed it...for several months.<P><BR>Possible Solutions: Bygones are bygones, I don't blame you for trying to avoid it, and I obviously don't think you maliciously did it, it was a mistake. Now to fix the mistake you need to bring the economy to equilibrium. Take some advice from the FED, put it in a patch message that the drop rate is increased and do it. Make a long sentence so it's two lines long, put it in caps if you must. Increase the drop rate, make em drop every time from every 60 in kunark if you have to. Then, a month or two down the road, when you see Aegis is just as common as all the other level 60 spells, silently nerf it. If it's brought up don't avoid it, say "We were just flooding the market, now Aegis is back to the same appearence level as all level 60 spells." That will earn some respect.<P><BR>8) Elemental Illusions: I REALLY hate that enchanters have these. I was surprised when you told enchanters you liked the idea of them casting illusions on others. Um, didn't you just say you thought they shouldn't have gotten illusion skeleton and shouldn't get illusion spectre? How come they get illusion elementals and pats on the back for more? Or are elementals less class defining for mages than the undead are for necros? Mages should get Change Form: Earth, Fire, Air, and Water to actually change into those elementals (Like a level 60 necro using arch lich to sit in spectre form next to his spectre pet) and it should be castable on others if anyone is going to get that. Enchanters can keep the illusion (Deelit scowls at Enchanters--) but they shouldn't get more that you're not going to give to us.<P><BR>Possible Solutions: Give us enchanter illusions with different names, possibly make them castable on others as well. We are Elementalists, Master of the Elements, summon Elementals, etc. How about giving us something other than fire and little blobs to show that?<P><BR>9) Pet Summons: Here comes the biggie-<P>a) The post 50 fire pet. We've been telling you it's a joke since we got it. Now granted we don't have a high level from Fires of Heaven shouting it out like the rangers did, but you're just as wrong. This pet sucks, I mean really sucks. I wouldn't solo an orc pawn with it, and I wouldn't bring it on an raid if we were doing Befallen. I don't need to say more here, everyone else will.<P><BR>Possible Solution: Make it not suck. It should cast level 44 spells if its 45. O'Kiels, Shieldskin line, and start flinging level 40-44 spells at normal casting time. Also, it should not melee at all, ever. When you do /pet attack it should sit right next to you and start casting spells. My 51 Earth spell makes a pet that averages 120 damage a round. If a spell cast takes two or three rounds it should do 2-3x that damage. This should take into account that pets are lower level and thus have a lesser chance of connecting with spells and have a greater chance of being partially resisted. All in all fire should cast a 600dd spell every 3 melee rounds. Between resists and level considerations, it should work out to same damage as earth.<P><BR>b) The post 50 air pet. Our pets were supposed to get classes right? There was talk and speculation that air was going to be a monk. Nope. How about you make air a monk? Necros get a monk pet, I want one too  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> The reason you should is right below in (e).<P><BR>Possible Solution: Make air into a class, the old archetype for air suggests monk. Apply what is below in (e).<P><BR>c) Dyzil's Defeaning Decoy and Taunts: Alright, old fire pet reborn! With Earth hps! Why can't it taunt? All pet taunts post 50 need to be looked at because they don't seem to exist. The only thing that EVER makes a mob hit a pet is because the pet is hitting it. If you fight the giants outside Kael Drakkel you can sick your pet on them and watch them run to hit you, ignoring pet completely. Also, why is this green? This should be blue like every other pet. It should melee for less damage (Thus worse than baseline earth) but have a higher ds (thus better). Why is it green? That just means mobs will hit it harder and that wipes any gain of the damage shield out. Why summon a pet with a 45pt ds that will die in lets say 50 hits when I could summon an earth with cadeu for 33pt ds and let it live for 75 hits.<P><BR>Possible Solution: Look into pet taunts. If you won't increase level to typical 51-54 summon levels, explain why. Evaluate damage shield effectiveness per lifespan vs. a 51 earth pet with cadeau. If an earth with cadeau gets more efficiency from it's damage shield, explain why I should use this non-rooting low-meleeing guy.<P><BR>d) Rage of Zomm: I don't own it, but I love the concept. I have no complaints except to remind you we're the masters of summoning and any increases you're giving to other classes can't put them above us when it comes to pets.<P><BR>e) Pets in general after 50. First off, it seems from testing that all post 50 pets have the same delay. Now my air, which used to hit faster than earth, doesn't. There's really no reason to use air now, because the small chance it will stun during those last 4 "gating" seconds of a fight doesn't outvalue the extra hp and damage of the earth. Second, all these pets are underpowered. There's just no other way to put it. I'll tell you what happened:<P>Pre-Kunark tanks were upset, and rightfully so, with no disciplines or effective armor or weapons in the game, a pet was as useful as a tank. If a mage knew how to pull (as I did in Lower Guk, having lived there for 15 levels :P) he effectively becomes a warrior + half a wizzie. Mages basically eliminated the need for like 5 classes. Verant knew the tanks were upset. (You can find Gordon talking about if you have this archived, he made an arguement that since a player is smarter than the AI a human tank is always better than a pet, it didn't fly to well with players)<P>Then Kunark came out. And Verant swung the other way.<P>Since you could get only 10 more levels between Pre and Post Kunark, the main distinction for warriors became useful disciplines and awesome equipment.<P>Pets didn't advance at all. An intelligent mage will tell you they went backwards (It's far more effective to chain cast 49 earths (200mana) with cadeau than 57 earths (300mana) with cadeau). It's like two different people went to work on these, one for buffing tanks and one for dimishing pets and they didn't recognize how one affected the other at all. When the mobs were tested against tanks they were totally out of proportion to how powerful pets should be.<P>How come when I go from 44 to 49 (5 levels, one of them a hell) my pet max melee jumps by 8 (46 to 54), but when I go from 51 to 57 (6 hell levels!) my max melee jumps by 2. It should jump by 10 at least! Tanks hit harder, wizzies get tons more mana, I get 2 more pet melee damage. Even my dd increases by 21% effiency (2.9dam/mana vs. 2.4 dam/mana) from 51 to 57 but my pet increases by 4%. The main difference between tanks now in any regard is equipment and certain useful disciplines. Since pets never get equipment or disciplines, that in and of itself should be the determining factor to put tanks far ahead. Tanks went from hitting in the 50-60s pre-kunark to hitting for triple digits and up post-velious, pets should at least move from hitting in the 50s to 70s.<P><BR>Possible solutions: Pets post 50 need a dramatic re-evaluation as to their total damage output versus tanks, and a lookback at why their power was reigned in and how that situation no longer exists. This applies to both necro and magician pets. Furthermore delay needs to once again be applied to pets to not automatically make water (when you can get a backstab to work) or earth (anytime else) the only choices. My prediction is that you will find pets should hit in ths 60-70s rather than 50s. Regardless of the outcome of that re-evaluation, max damage between 51 and 57 pets needs to jump by 10 because you are working much harder for more levels than before and getting less of a return, and this is our class skill! Any changes that occur need to be passed on to the epic pet (As an increase of 10 max damage would put the 57 earth past the epic pet in melee damage).<P><BR>10) Renew Elements Line: The pet heal line was never continued, why? I still use the level 20 version at level 56.<P><BR>11) Burnout IV: I go 2 normal levels + five hell levels and I get a spell that gives my pet an extra 5% haste? I'm on to you! You're trying to cover up the fact that Muzzle of Mardu and Burnout III already puts the pet virtually at the haste cap. That makes continuing this line essentially worthless. How about making the other parts of this spell better? Or better yet, remove it and see 10.<P><BR>12) Monster Summoning: Is it technically feasible to see if pets can take on factions/abilities of the copied mob? Factions because I don't want a lower level pet attracting green trash when things won't agro on me, and abilities because it would make this line more than a random pet type that looks different. (i.e. Useful and cool &gt; just cool)<P><BR>13) Exile Summoned: Pull up your spell listings and calculator. We get Char at 52, 700 damage for 260 mana, evocation fire based. Exile Summoned, 675 damage for 250 mana, evocation magic based. Char is 2.69dam/mana at 56, Exile is 2.7dam/mana at 56. 2.7/2.69=1.003. That means if I use Exile summoned I get not a 20% advantage against summoned mobs, not a 10-5%, but .3% advantage. Now, since spells gain an extra 10% fizzle on their first level, Char is more useful than exile summoned, both mana-wise and speed-wise. You lose 9.7% efficiency by casting it. Now at 57 we get Shock of Steel, 795damage for 275mana. 2.89dam/mana. By this time Exile has become 688dam for 250mana or 2.75dam/mana. Shock has an extra 10% fizzle rate and is 5% more efficient (2.89/2.75=1.05). So normally you would lose 5% efficiency casting it, until you take into account that mages specialize in conjuration. Now granted I don't know the numbers on this, but I would THINK that conjuration would take off enough mana to remove that 5% deficit, and even if it doesn't, once we hit 58 Shock loses it's 10% deficit and becomes more efficient than Exile. At the very most (and this is being generous) Exile Summoned is useful for ONE LEVEL (57). At 56 Char is more efficient and fast. At 57 Exile is slightly better (5%) than Char or Shock of Steel unless you specialize in conjuration. At 58 Shock of Steel becomes the spell of choice no matter what. I understand that Druids have this same problem with spells of theirs.<P>Possible Solution: Up damage to 10-15% greater efficiency like all other members of this line.<P><BR>14) Deneumont: Kudos to the person who FINALLY fixed the Rain spell hits pet issue (Once you nerfed the Sword of Runes proc and said you could distinguish between mobs and pets I knew this was coming), and all the people who thought up the spells on test which prevented this thing from being longer than it was. Included are what I think are some nice flavor things that aren't really balance issues, but certainly add to the class:<P>Voice Graft<BR>A level 1 Fluffy Bunny Pet (Okay I know you have something cute-ish in the global file)<BR>For our four main pets to not look like giant blobs of goo post 50, somehow I think Dyzil's looks appropriate<BR>Phantom Armor to acutally change the physical look of you, Velious could do this nicely (with the Velium-look of everything etherial things look possible)<BR>A sword, I don't care if I can swing it or it gives me any stats, I want to hold a sword, and have my armor look (see above) on a caster<P>Thank you for your time, I know I'm only one of many<P>Deelit Elementalcaller<BR>56 Bunny-totin' Sword-slingin' Story-writin' Magician of Erollisi Marr<BR>Divine, Bertox</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>  The other thing I have to take exception to in Absor's original post was his assertion that Magicians are an effective solo class.<P>   For 1-50, we certainly are, but by the time you hit about 55 or so, any mob that gives exp hits too hard for the pet to tank it.<P>   Skyfire names, for example, will chew up a lvl 57 earth pet before I can kill them with chain nuking.<P>    In contrast, my lvl 53 druid can easily and safely solo these same critters. Snare/Root/Winged Death/Sleaves of Doom/Repeat. Plus if I get bored hunting names I can always go quad kite giants in burning woods (usually its triple kite actually, sticking four snares on top of the giant fort is a real pain).<P>    My lvl 53 druid is a far, far more efficient soloer than my lvl 57 magician. Mages are not effective soloers in the high end game for the simpel reason that the pets cannot tank blue mobs at this point. Those classes which can solo w/o having to tank the mob e.g. necro/druid/wizzy, supercede the magician at this point.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Hello, I would like to introduce myself as Ealdalor ElderRune. I am a level 60 magician from terris thule with over 160 days played on my magician. I would like to thank you for giving mages the oppurtunity to speak, and I hope you listen. As for me, I have very little problems with the mage class. To completely balance it, however, there certainly is some tuning to be done.<P>Here are my ideas on spells that could be added to aid magician in becoming what they were intended to be :<P>level 39 : summon :Sphere of light<BR>This would cost 250 mana and would be an item insta clickable from the inventory with 3 charges of a blind spell. It would be lore and no drop to make sure the mage couldnt over power himself with them, or give them to his friends. The purpose of this spell is self protection. For months Ive been aggrivated by dying in zones like the dreadlands because of green mobs with sow speed that are KoS to everyone. At level 60, it is just not right from many perspectives to have a magician at such a disadvantage in out door zones. This orb would be a great solution because it is not as powerful as the root or snare other mages want, and merely provides a means for escape in large out door zones, buying a mage more time to run away while the enemy is blinded a few seconds. It would not work in dungeons simply because blind would only cause the mob to run away and most likely make a train back to the caster, only killing him faster. It would not aid a mage in combat because a blinded mobwoudl stand there hitting the closest thing to it (a pet) as long as that thing isnt moving, it would path off and away like fear. PLEASE impliment this item, how can a class at 60 be balanced if it dies to greens like a level 35?<P>Level 58 : Elemental Regrowth<BR>This spell would be the same as the lower level chloroplast druid and shaman spell, except it would be pet only. It would cost the same mana as chloro plast, and have the same effect. I think this would be the best solution to the pet healing problem as it accomplishes the purpose of reducing down time, without helping the mage too much in combat. You could even make it not stack with other regen spells, but a balanced level 60 magician should be able to maintain his pet in a group and on large raids, it is a pain in the rear (so to speak) to have to watch your own pet's health and ask the cleric to try and target it for small down time heals. Adding this spell would make high level mages much more raid friendly, and their pets more raid effective without overpowering solo like a CH or higher heal would.<P>Level 60: Aegis of the Elements<BR>This spell would cost 500 mana and be a pet only buff. It would give the pet + 200 hp, +20 ac, and + 20 to all resists. It would have a 45 minute duration or so. Having a pet buff like this would also make mages a lot more raid friendly with their pets. Especially by adding those resists, it would help pets survive through large targets or even normal encounters better because of how hard it is for a healer to target them when they are worrying about the group members and have such a limitted target system. The high mana cost would balance this buff out as well as it being 60 so as to not aid in soloing much (what 60 solos?). Why can't a balanced level 60 mage buff their own pet a little?<P>Other then those 3 spells, mage class looks good to me. My only other problems are yes : the 50+ fire pets stink, they cast lvl 12-20 wizard spells at high resist rates and at times will cast dispell and/or radius spells, breaking mezzes and debuffing shaman/enc slow down spells. I also agree with the summoned weapons for pets, and please use variety. Make dot weapons, stun weapons, ice weapons, fire weapons, maybe even a small slow down proc? weapon... basically, use them to add some variety and style to each mage. (and dont forget to give them a look better then FS :P)<P>Thanks for your time again,<BR>Ealdalor, arch mage of terris thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>As I see it the decoy pet should never be used as a normal pet.  Rather as a diversion so that a frenzied caster can stand back and cast a spell. <P>What it should have:<P>-Little or no damage output (none would be perferred as it would allow the mobs to be mezzed)<BR>-An aoe that does a huge taunt<BR>-Extremely high hit points<BR>-Low cast time<P>So a pet like this could be used by a mage to save a save a cleric or enchanter that is getting beat on.  The mage can kill his pet and quickly cast this one.  The mobs turn their attention to the decoy saving the group mate.

</FONT><HR>I guess ill list my complaints.<P>Some things i think that are needed.<P>Problem :Pathing<BR>Pathing problems cause pets to be unwelcome in places and on high level raids. Lag can also be a factor on high level raids when attempting to control your pet. When 50+ people are beating on something, even with the filters all on and the graphics down to the lowest settings, it can take up to 3 seconds for your pet to get your command or more. <P>Soloution 1: Fix all pathing problems and somehow lower the number of players it takes on high level mobs to something that the client and computers with your minimum system requirements can handle. <P>Downside: takes lots of time and man power for Verant.<P>Soloution 2: Give mages the following spell.<P>Entrench Summoned<BR>Level 49<BR>Casting time 9-10<BR>Mana cost 200ish.<BR>Primary Effect : Roots pet in place until it is dispelled by the mage. or for balancing only if the pet is killed or reclaimed.<P><BR>Possible Balancing.<BR>Secondary Effects : Lowers pet regen to 0<P>In most cases this will keep a pet from porting (like they do in hate.) to somewhere deep in zone and then bringing back a train of nasties. <P>Downsides: This might slightly unbalance the vision for pet control however lag does that quite a bit. There are several more danger factors if a magician cant pull his pet to his side to defend him if a stray mob decides to beat on the mage.<P>Problem : 52+ Fire pets.<BR>These fire pets are designed to be wizards however they only cast the following spells.<BR>lv 12 Shock of lightning--Magic Based---78 damage.<BR>lv 16 Flame Shock -- Fire Based -- 110 Damage.<BR>lv 20 Force Shock -- Magic based -- All or nothing-- 179 damage. <BR>This pet's damage out put is little more than half in the meele department. The pets hp is very low. And with the best spell being an all or nothing spell it makes the pet useless.<P>Lets see the comparison on a lv 49 and lv 52 fire pet's possible damage.<P>lv 49                lv 52<BR>56x4 meele (224)     36x4 meele (144)<BR>Damage Shield (81)   Okels (4) <BR>(double hitting mob) (on a double hitting mob)<BR>Fire pet DD (42)     Force Shock (179)<BR>(rarely full resist) (Frequeltly full resists)<BR>------------------------------------------------<BR>                    Totals<BR>------------------------------------------------<BR>347 Total damage.    327 Total Damage <BR>------------------------------------------------<P>That only lists potential damage. I can use burnout 3 and increase meele damage by  50% which makes the gap between the numbers even large. When you add in the full resists of the Force shock spell and the frequency that the pet casts the shock of lightning spell. The gap becomes unbridgable. To add to all of this raw data the pet debuffs (Cancle Magic) mobs. Which after an enchanter has spent alot of work debuffing the mobs tends to find this pet not only useless but a liability. <P>Solution 1: Return the firepet as it was pre 50. <BR>By far this is probably the easiest way to balance it. And it serves the purpose as the best damaging pet i can have as it did before.<P>Solution 2: Replace the lv 20 Force shock spell with the lv 29 Inferno shock spell (250 dd) (it is a fire pet after all) and make it go toward the middle of the road spells rather than the low end spells. Also remove its cancle magic totaly.<P>The lv 58 pet should lean towards the high end spell more than the 52 one.<P>Downsides. This would have to be balanced. I would have chosen a softer spell or something in between say around 225 but there is no such wizard spell. it goes from ice shock (179)which isnt appropriate for a fire pet to inferno shock (250). Perhapse you could create a new spell in between.<P><BR>Problem: Pets breaking mez.<BR>This is really just a point of not knowing in large group / number of mob situations that my pet has gone off on a tangent untill its too late. When i tell my pet to attack mob Assist. and mob Mezzed breaks mez and smacks my pet forcing my pet to switch over to beating it. I have no way to know that my pet is beating on mob mezzed. This causes enchanters alot of greif and mages alot of un welcome replies or no replies at all in groups. <P>Solution 1: Make mez transfer any hate that the mob had for a pet to the mage and wipe the mobs hate list of the pet.<P>Downsides: balancing issues. Maybe.<P>Solution 2: Create someway to relate the pets current target that is fast and effective in high lag situations.<P>Downsides: Lots of coding to do this.<P>Solution 3: Create a spell that puts the pet to sleep completely. So that nothing can wake it for a 3-5 min duration. Even if the pet is hit it will sit there and ignore the barrage until dead or someone pulls it off. During this time the mage will be basicaly without a pet. <P>Downsides: I cant really see any. Maybe balance. However a mage - a pet is a weak wizard.<P><BR>Problem: The usefulness of summoned items.<BR>Summoned items become useless to anyone well before we are even able to summon them. And at high levels they arent asked for at all except the occasional tell for food or a cold stone. <P>Solution : Revamp current summoned items to make them fit within the mid range equipment of the level summoned. Also add upgrades to said items so that at higher levels they can be useful. <P>Downsides : Some balance issues. However i still think that my ranger friend would prefer his Yak over my lv 44 Sword of symbols. (that spell dosent exist.) 1. a droped item is more powerful 2. A game item doesnt disappear when you log.<P>General Wishes:<BR>Voice Graft.<BR>Bind sight Pet only.<P>Pet Complete heal: Now hear me out dont read the title and click off =). Pet complete heal would compelete heal the pet for 500-600 mana with a 15 second casting time costing a malachite. Lets see why this is balanced and yet useful.<P>Problem: Pets suffered when the code for them changed.<BR>Its been said that you didnt lower anything and pets could still do the damage as before this code change however. I believe this to be true. However, NPC's and PC's are controlled differenty.<BR>When pets were originaly designed their stats were set based on the fact that the NPC AI controled them and this made their stats very low. When pets were switched over to the PC AI or basicaly PET AI Cloned off of pc's. They underwent several changes. The following are the noticed changes. My pet can never hit mobs above a certain level with spells. My pet's meele damage against mobs equal to my level is cut by 50%. My pet's defense has been cut by 50% or more. I will use this illustration. Before the change i could take my 51 earth pet unbuffed without weapons and damage shield. and he could take a lv 39 hill giant down with half his health sometimes more remaining. After this change my pet will die unbuffed and un damage shielded. Even though it can now quad hit automaticaly. It cannot take the 96 double attacks of that mob. This should not be so. Another example i will use. I created a mage and leveled him to 4. When i was 4 in the old old days before pets could even cast my pet (yellow) could then take down a blue or even con to me at that time and be hurt but alive. Now after the change in AI the pet (yellow) is nearly wasted by a blue mob and decimated by an even con mob. <P>Solution 1: Look at the way that stats were and are interpreted and adjust the pet's stats accordingly. <P>Downside: you may have considered the un-intentional nerf the thing that balanced the pets. I dont because of the fact that magicians are 75% pet. unlike other pet classes we give up alot for our pets so they should be very strong. Concidering how you guys design mobs now days it really hurts the mage class on several playing fields. <P>Solution 2: Create spells like the burnout series that will raise the pet's defenses. (AC, AGI, DEX) Siginificantly. But lower its ability to do damage. <P>Downsides: balancing the spell may require that it doesnt stack with burnout and other effects but it would help. Then magicians could choose to have their pet tank or do damage based on the situation.<P><BR> <P><BR>To resummon a pet in battle you must <BR>-begin casting when its around 20% health. (300)<BR>-Kill the old pet at 10% health<BR>-Cast Burnout III (150)<BR>-Cast Shield of Lava (120)<P>This process takes around 20 casting time roughly and 570 mana at 52. And using the upgrades at lv 57 would cost a mage 705 mana. <P>So at lv 52 it costs me more mana to cheal my pet but its slightly faster around 57 it becomes more efficient, saving me roughly 105 mana. This may seem unbalancing at lv 57 with the 105 mana saved but by  that time soloing is nearly impossible and you group so its a help to the healers.<P>Summon armor<P>Restore the way phantom armor worked in beta by applying the armor graphic to the mage when cast.<P>POINTY HATS!<P>ok im finished. I wish to thank you for the time you spend reading and responding to this thread and these posts absor. The mage is almost balanced however we are still least desired class on a raid. This seems to stem from the pathing issues and mez breaking issues. My mage without a pet isnt even as useful as a druid or rouge. My mage with a good pet is as good as the rest. <P>Kavin Magius<BR>52 Tank Mage FOREVER!<BR>Bertox<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just a few issues, one only partially addressed in previous posts.<P>Mage Velious Armor<BR>So far, out of the quested armors and drops from PoG, we get armor with effects that are kind of pointless (like we already have the spell...look at wizard leggings...Elemental Armor...) or we have a bazillion items already with that effect (Reclaim Energy on Bracers? And with a casting time? That brings the amount of items with R.E. up to probably 10 or more and some are a lot easier to get). Give us some more useful effects on our armor, i'm not saying no mana lava shields or Burnouts arent useful... just the idea of us getting our own spells while monks get our 55 summon kinda hurts ;p<P>Elementalists without Elemental based spells?<BR>We don't get a Cold based spell. And after 44, until the 55DoT, we don't get any non-fire based spells. Which makes it hard to hunt in places that drop spells that don't require a multi-group event (ie. Hard to hunt in Skyfire). A nice cold based DD or Bolt line would be nice, though you stated you're not looking to add those.<P>DoT Line<BR>Don't know why every other mage is saying they hate it. It however may need it's casting time reduced so mages can actually use the interrupting spell-casting portion of our DoTs.<P>Spell Drops<BR>Our defining spells post 50 are Call of the Hero and our class-based pets. Yet 1 pet and the CoH scroll is hard to come by, while other class defining spells (the 56 rez) is sold by a vendor. Not to knock on clerics cuz I love the 56 rez, but more common pet and CoH and maybe Muzzle of Mardu (this is our only means of giving haste to our pet that can't be overwritten...Burnout line haste doesn't stack with enchanter hastes) spell drops would be nice.<P><BR>-Kelston<BR>54th Magician<BR>The Tribunal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>As far as I can see the #1 mage balance issue is pathing. I conjecture(sp?) that most other class balance issues stem from this one. However, after playing as long as I have I have given up on this issue EVER being fixed. The summon pet spell on Test is a nice idea but with a 5 second cast time and not pulling a pet that has agroed is damn near worthless. <P>A pet return summon should be like COTH is for pcs. It should pull the pet back and clear agro for the pet AND mage if and ONLY if the pet had been agro'd.<P>Pathing places.<BR>In cazic the pyramid referred to as 4c and upper 4c is terrible.<P>In Hate, there are many places, and all my raids I have been not allowed to use a pet. So I can cast on about 50% of the mobs and be of limited use.<P>A mage is simply not terribly wanted post 50 unless they are COTH equipped. I was on a raid to get part of rogue epic the other day and someone asked me to make them some summoned shurikens...Imagine my disgust when a rogue from my guild did it before I was able to get the spell memmed. <P>I can't comment on the fire pets post 50 because I have no knowledge of them first hand.<P>Mages with root/snare? I don't honestly know if we should get them. I WANT some type of escape spell but do not know if it is truely appropriate for the class. At the same time it is not appropriate for druids, clerics, and wizzies to get any type of pet. Much like mage dot's..hehe..<P>I'm trying not to make this a long post, but dammit I care about my mage. These issues are important, and I would really like to see some of the major problems with the class fixed.<P>The epic quest truely does need looked at as does our post 50 spells. No pet spells should be dropped as they are our class defining spells.<P>One note of thanks though..Thanks for fixing the root over riding snare thing. In all my time of play I had never once heard that it was broken, but now I can indeed use any pet I want if I manage to find a group.<P><BR>Sorry for the long post guys.<BR>Respectfully yours<BR>~Araladium (51 magi Prexus server)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

In order to use them you have to be petless, 99% of the time this is unacceptable.

</FONT><HR>remember two things from this long post:<BR>1.Shadow Step<P>2.Pets need better hp, ac, and/or defensive skills to match higher leveled mobs who cream us in any attempt of solo situation.<P>We know mages will not get root or stun or snare so we need a)a way to escape and b)a pet that can actually tank damage (people that melee can't solo and people that kite/root can), mage can try to solo but can't kite/root so that makes soloing extremely difficult.<P><BR>lengthly Explanation below:<BR>Mages can solo at any level, sure they can, as with any other class. The problem I have with a mage is the higher they get the lower the mobs they must solo. This would be acceptable if the class wasn't pushed as the great soloer, because they are not.<P>Wizards get snare/root; chanters get stun, root, fear, memory blur; druids get snare/root/sow (fear); necros get snare/root/fear; shamans get root/sow; clerics get root/fear, every single caster/priest has a form of 'kiting' or 'root/nuke' except for the mage.<P>My point? Two points: <BR>1.Mobs around level 26-27 start to hit proportionaly much higher then the players hit points allow, forcing many classes to solo. Those who can attack without being touched can still solo no problem (i.e. anyone mentioned above). Since a mage has some decent dd's around this level we are able to solo still effectively for a while (although not as effectively as the classes around us, but we digress as we enter the 'harder' part of a mage's life).<BR>I don't think any one has a problem with mages even at this point, since we can still solo fairly well.<P>But now we get to the upper 40s and 50s where mobs have become nothing short of uber. The dmg they deal is high, hard and fast. Our dd's take so long to cast that a resist or two and we're done for, by that point the pet is almost dead and we must chain cast. <P>Which brings up point two, if a pet dies we have no option but to gate. We have no shadow step, we have no stun, we have no root. Wouldn't it hurt to give us shadow step??? We either get a gate off while being hit repeatidly or we die. We have no options and the one option we do have is a risk in itself. (I've died a few times gating, I got the gate off but died in the process since the client doesn't update the red hp bar quick enough...)<P>The risk is high, once a mob is on us we have no way to get it off, the mobs hit us so quick and hard we are dead before you could count to 5.<P>My 45 mage has good spells but when you try to fight a level 40 mob with a tank that's level 36/37 the pet doesn't last long and if you get a few resists its over (now that more mobs are resisting magic too often, life becomes even harder and soloing not much of option).<P>What I'd like to see for mages:<BR>Summonds are crap, the mod rod is good and Cold Stone is good, Levi rings are nice, work along those lines, weapons that proc/buff etc. are the lines you should be looking at...<P>My spell hot keys haven't changed since level 16, that's just wrong. I even have gate hotkeyed all the time since there's nothing better to put there :)<P>Moster Summonding/Voice Graft: I put these two together for one reason, Moster Summonding is confusing to a lot of people, you are in Oasis and a mage brings their pet (Sand Giant) to the dock, scaring everybody or you see a Sand Giant in the distance, go in for the kill and realize it's just a stupid pet. Give a mage Voice Graft and it could become confusing even moreso by having 'fake npcs' but this also could open up the option of some sweet player made quests where the mage could voice graft the beginning of a quest...I personally don't like Moster Summonding and realize it was more or less put in game so we'd stop complaing about have more models for pets...(Judging from some pet's I've summonded I've pulled models from mobs not in that zone, so there's gotta be room to free up :)<P>Evoc/Conjuration: Too late in the game, I've built up (like many Mages) Evoc for a good reason, best dd (although bolt) pre kunark was evoc and the Kunark spells were mostly Evoc.<P>DOTs?: Why? We aren't a dot class and this shows to me a lack of ideas. In truth I don't find it fits our class but take with a smile anyway since it adds something new to a boring class :)<P>Pets: I found they were fine after sword of runes nerf but I believe they weren't up to par before then anyway :) In my opinion, a pet should be at 40%ish hp after a good battle (no resists) fighting a mob approx 4 or 5 levels below the caster not 20% hp. I find the pet fighting a mob his own level he ends up around the amount of hp he should have with a mob 5 levels higher. We don't have the ability of not having a pet tank all the time so they are always getting beat on and should be tough enough to take the dmg and then some. Some people will claim that will make the mage no risk solo which is not true. That is with no resists, toss in 2 resists and you have your pet down to about 20%, 3 resists/not full dmg and the mage needs to tank a little. Still risky. The risk should be lowered anyway, since we dump a good 80% of mana on a mob with no real hp regen and no mana regen our downtime is still greater then other soloers even though our risk is higher.<P>Problem: We are great in one on one battles with mobs 10 levels or more below us. A mob 5 levels below us can be done but can be risky. This doesn't seem to be the life of a soloer. Of the classes that can solo I find the mage to be one of the weakest in soloing effectively.<P>Solution: (other then play another class :)<BR>The only solutions for the mage is to make pets have more hp/ac etc. so they can actually tank something near/slightly above their level (I know the mobs will not be weakened and its funny how it seems hybrids/warriors are getting defensive boosts yet the mage's pet (their tank) isn't getting much of anything). <P>Give us shadow step so we can actually have a way to get out of a jam without actually gating. <P>Or scratch those two upgrades (ultimately mages need those 2 simple things (and the whole LD issue)) and admit that the mage is not meant to solo and make them more group friendly (CoH does not make the mage group friendly, that'd be like saying Clarity is why people play Chanters, which is what people say who don't know the class). We can't even cast our magic resist buff on other people :(<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>If we're considering balance...<BR>I believe the only thing that really needs to be balanced about the mage class is their pets. Mage pets are only marginally (if at all) better than necromancer pets, yet mages rely much much more on their pets than necromancers do.<P>The reason mage pets aren't far and away better than necromancer pets is that they stop melee combat to cast. High level necromancer pets also get to cast (more rarely than mage pets) but their cast is a proc, they still get to do melee damage in the same round that they cast. With pets nearly 10 levels lower than the mage, the pets are almost always casting against creatures much more powerful in level, so they are resisted quite frequently -- making the rounds that pets stop to cast in large part simply lost time. Necromancer pets aren't faced with this problem. Add in the fact that necromancer pets have more hitpoints than 3 of the 4 mage pets (according to GZ) and hit for only one less point max than a mage pet of the same level, and necromancer pets arguably do more damage in a great many situations than mage pets do.<P>My suggestions to bring pet strength into balance:<BR>1) Reduce the damage output of the necromancer pet.<BR>2) Reduce the total number of hitpoints of the necromancer pet.<BR>2) Give necromancer pets the ability to cast (a resistable lifetap for instance) and make that take up necro pet combat rounds.<BR>3) Make mage pet casts into frequent procs, so that they do melee damage in the same round that they cast.<P>Please note that I'm not saying mage pets aren't powerful enough, I'm just saying that they aren't properly balanced in comparison to necromancer pets. If mages are the masters of pets, why are their pets not clearly more powerful than necromancer pets?<P>Nemuneir Noldaron<BR>Elementalist of Ayonae Ro<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

id really like to see some humanoid post 50 pets, among other things.<P>rage of zomm: should be a fat angry eye.<BR>should cast fast enough to be an emergency spell and should be able to servive attack long enough for us to cast a real pet, should a lvl 60 mage really be pretty much defensless if he gets attacked and doesnt already have pet up?<P>dots: if i wanted a good pet and dots, i wouldve made a necro, nuff said?<P>Dyzil's Deafening Decoy:raise its lvl so it wont be green, give it an area spell that has no effect other than cause mad amounts of agro.<P>higher lvl pet healing spell: im all for it, personally i think i should be able to heal my pet almost as efficiantly as a shamon or druid can heal others, i am a master summoner am i not?<P>improved invisibility: originally, mages were better at invisibility than wizards were, yet they get the upgrade and we get...dots??<P>phantom armor:fewer bags of components would be nice<P>aegis of ro:dont know<P>pet fear immunity:see aoe fear above<P>robe of conjuration:dont know<P>pet health bars: this would be nice, id also like to see our command range significaly increased, and the problem with pets being unable to hear me when there is a differance in height.<P>pet power: 1 - 50 our pets are appropriate, they can dish out enough dmg and take enough beating to keep us viable, well done.<BR>51 - 60 our pets leave quite a bit to be desired, the reason that ive heard for the lack of increase in pet power post 50 is that at lvl 49 our pets a pretty much as tough as they can be without makeing them overpowered so they only get a very slight upgrade post 50, and in norrath proper this may be true, a good post 50 mage pet with a solid group behind it can tank the very toughest non epic mobs in norrath proper, this is as it should be. its when you go to kunark and velious that there is a problem, with the inflated hp and capability to dish out amazing amounts of dmg pets are an annoyance at best, when in reality if the only tanks available to a group is a couple mage pets, that group should still be viable, but it isnt, not by a longshot. i would like to use our epic weapon as an arguement against our pets being as tough as they can be without overpowering them, but there will never be enough of them to have an adverse effect on any givin server, so that pet can be as tough as you want, nobody will have one so who cares right? imho post 50 mage pets should have 4000+ hp and hit for as much as 70 points of dmg at thier best, they should also taunt well enough to pull things off of a warrior that isnt taunting or a soloing mage that is dropping everything he's got on em because thats the only chance hes got to get the mob killed before it eats through his pet. pets define us as a class, not our nukes, not our summons, its all about our pets, as long as our pets dont make the cut, neither do we, cause if all we have to offer a group is third rate nukes and a dmg shield, that group will go get itself a druid every time. well thats my pet rant, i could probably add more to it but this thread really isnt about our pets, even though it should be, so i will end it here, thanx for reading it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1) Give us some ports.  Running all over the place gets old after awhile.  We are magicians right?<P>2) Summon us better armor/shields. Taking a dirt nap in less than 3 seconds flat gets old real quick.  Barely enough time to take a screenshot of the high level mobs.<P>3) Make our FA quest easier to obtain. It's nice to see everyone else running around with their FA item but only one magician that I know of on my server.  Obvious balance issue.  It's no longer "group seeks mage with CoH"  its "group seeks mage with FA".<P>4) Get rid of the summon bandages line.  Its bad enough that melee/hybrid gear can summon bandages now.  PoG boots was a slap in the face.  Boots of Conjuration.<P>5) More caster loot would be nice, tired of going up against high level mobs for breastplates, etc. The mana robe is garbage by the way.  Apothic gear kinda sucks also.<P>6) Post 50 pets really need to get some upgrades, they need to be stronger so we can solo.  Some people chose this class to solo because of our work schedule, etc.  I think its lame that a 49 necro can take down Lightbringer, but we can't come close until level 57, even then its hardly possible.<P>7) More mana on the mana rods<P>8) Lower casting time on Gate...we are magicians, we should be experts on magic....supposedly.<P>9) Give us elemental DD's for each element..only makes sense.  <P>10) Lower reists, Malo at level 60 is suck. 8)<P>11) I think CoH on the same continent would be cool.

Cleric=exp res/heals, Enchanters=mez/clarity, Warriors=nice loot/tanks/dmg, and so on...magicians=pets/trains. <BR>Anyone who says magicians are "wanted/needed" in groups obviously has not played the class that long.

</FONT><HR>A couple other minor bits..<P>- Level 8 pets use lapis instead of malachite.  This is still around..  It was orginally a data entry mistake.  Please take this chance to fix it.<P>- Eye of Zomm was originally able to be cast as well as the mage pet.  It was changed way back due to methods to do better pet coding.. The spell is pretty useless to us as we are almost never without a pet.  Is it possible to have it changed back?<P>- Column of Fire (Level 12 mage AoE) still has no graphic, and an area of effect that is SO tiny is really difficult to hit more than one mob.  Please increase it it's area of effect substantially and give it a graphic.<P>- Ward summoned line.  This line is almost never used given that there are so few summoned monsters around. Even with the few in the Hole and in Kunark I'd recommend that you give each of the ward line to mages (and druids) one rank earlier.<P>- Shard of the Core should fit in ammo slot and be droppable.  Increase to 39th level if needed.<P>- Modulation Rod, suggested change: Drains a percentage of targets current HP and converts at same rate to mana.  Expendable.  (No need to have lore removed.  They don't turn into newbie death sticks this way either..)<P>- Eye of Tallon / Velocity, not worthy to be 57 & 58th level spells.. Please lower their level.  34-39 should be fine.  (eye of tallon should be even lower than that.)<P>---------------<BR>Possible suggested replacements for above spells;<P>- There was originally a spell that transported an item from one person to another.  It may have even been across zones.  Suggest it's readded if still possible.<P>- People still looking for a "possess pet" spell.  Maybe be impracticle, but sounds like a good idea.

</FONT><HR>First off, I'd like to say I agree with what Ealdalor said earlier.  His defensive spell (The orb of light thingie), pet buff, etc all seemed like great ideas.  Just have a few things that I'd add to the list or agree with other people who have already said something.<BR>- Improved Invis:  Was amazed that mages didn't receive this spell with Velious.  Would be a nice addition to our spells and take the randomness out of a spell that works in few places anyway at high levels.  <BR>- Epic quest:  It's difficult and it's good that it's difficult.  Maybe look into drop rate on Earth staff, but might be alright as it is.  Not really a complaint.<BR>- Improved pet healing:  Higher level pet heals would be great.  As is, I hardly use the current heal spell because it is usually more effective to chain cast pets.<BR>- PoG robe:  Would agree that it should be upgraded to the level 56 DS Cadeau of Flame to be in par with other robes.<BR>- Robe of Burning Rage:  Drops from Hoshkar, one of the harder, perhaps the hardest, dragon in Veeshan's Peak.  Stats quite a bit worse than velious robe (PoG, Quests), but mainly am concerned that the effect (Burnout III) is the exact same effect as the pantaloons of Velious (PoG, Quests).  Perhaps a change to something like Burnout IV, Muzzle, something else that doesn't make me realize how limited our spells already, without copying the effect of other items we have (Reclaim energy for instance, don't think anyone needs 10 items with the same effect)<BR>- Level 50+ fire pets:  Will agree with their lack of effectiveness as said by several people so far.<P>Other than that I'm satisfied with the class for the most part and have loved it since I started playing in August of 99.<P>Vreminsk Valkyre<BR>Level 58 Conjurer<BR>~Legions of Darkness~<BR>Innoruuk<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Thank you for taking the time to re-initiate this class discussion.  Take the next paragraph with a grain of salt as I do believe you have our best interests at heart, and I wish to be part of the solution.<P>Your initial statement is interesting.  All classes at upper levels can solo, albeit some more successful than others.  Mages cannot slow/snare, fear, root or stun by themselves, and the first two without exception.  With few exceptions, this makes kiting (and thus soloing) a much tougher experience.  If you use chain pet casting, keep in mind mages have no means of replenishing mana the way necromancers, enchanters, or even wizards may do.  Modulation rods cost 200 mana to cast.  From using that lore rod we gain back only 150 mana and still lose 225hps.  Thus, we are not as effective at soloing as it first appears.  Can we solo? Of course.  This is true of the three remaining pure casters.  However, I believe we should be looking more to fitting better in groups, not being the total answer to the soloing class.  Pathing is the major issue that discourages groups from taking mages.  Our pets pull mobs from floors above and below or sometimes disappear entirely via pathing to pull mobs from unrelated areas.  Honestly I do not believe VI has the resources or the time to address the pathing problems in the zones already in existence.  It is time consuming and not cost effective to keeping this product viable.  With that in mind, we may improve the mage class in ways that neither upset the fragile class balance nor demand unreasonable resources to correct the errors.<P>My suggestions are as follows: <P>Ultra low dly weapon summon that is not usable by any race/class combination (thus only usable by our pets) to provide better taunt -- no procs necessary. Since dly doesn't affect pet attack rate, you can make it 10 or whatever without it adversely affecting game balance. It is just a means of taunting without doing damage.   I believe weapons with procs would be neat, but game balance is the main issue.  I'm not interested in a pet weapon that increases the pet damage beyond what it can do now (see fire pet for exceptions).<P>Antifear buff: making this a summoned item would be appropriate, race:none if that solves players abusing the use of it.<P>Conjuration spells: Flat out, more magic-,conjuration-based DD. Either replace the existing dots with these or look at a few of the levels where you aren't getting a magic-based damage source for 2 spell levels. After kunark came out, I chose evoc a) because I never considered chain casting pets and b) because there are more spells with more punch (lavabolt, scars, scintillation, sirocco, exiled summoned series, manastorm, flame of seukor). Now compare the conjuration dd spells. They are lacking in cost-effective damage per second and they are only magic based. While this balances somewhat with all the savings you may receive from conjured objects, VI has already admitted a possible mistake tagging some as evoc. I'd like to see this shifted to at least more of a 3/5 evoc to 2/5 conj dd or possibly 2/5 evoc to 3/5 conj dd. Our main title from 55-59 is Conjurer, yet we are largely evokers when it comes to casting damage spells.  Also, there is a lot of creativity that can go into nonmagic-based dd without getting outside the concept. E.g, Magi'kot's Flaming (or Unerring) Fist, a bolt-like spell (fire based) that still always hits, and maybe has a neat hand or gauntlet graphic rushing at the target before it explodes, etc.  I hate to point this out, but once I receive my FA, Call of the Hero would be the only reason I'd choose to consider conjuration specialty -- which I won't, because I will no longer need to chain cast pets the same way (summon orb, cast pet, delete orb, recast orb with 1 charge just in case).  <P>Higher lvl conjure lev ring that affects group. Our levitate from the ring actually lasts a fairly short time. One charge, 150-200 mana (25mana * 6 for one charge being my reasoning).<P><BR>Ok, this may be unpopular but: either make our modulating rod nodrop and cost 0-5 mana or create a separate, nodrop version strictly for mages. I keep wondering why they believe 225hps isn't a big enough penalty for 150 mana. Even if the ratio is different/higher, a nodrop version would make sense.<P>A higher lvl pet-only healing spell. Renew summoning at 20th lvl is our current highest. No wonder so many of you went conj-specialty with chain pet casting!<P>Summon 1-handed staves or other blunts. Making mod rod into a weapon was interesting, but spending 200 mana for it? Suggestions welcome here. I was thinking of staves that provide dex-only buff to pets.<P><BR>Attribute pet damage to the caster:  We get the hate but not the pet damage. I've had GM's argue with me that we receive credit for it. Try sicking your pet on something, kill off pet just before it is dead and have someone else attack it. You receive no credit. If a 1:1 ratio interferes with a pet sucking up a portion of the xp from the caster not contributing, change the ratio.<P>Phantom Armor:  Make a costlier component that only takes one gem instead of 4 cat's eye agates.  I keep a 10-slot backpack full and long raids threaten my supply (even faster if I am fighting dispelling mobs like in Chardok or Sebilis).  Also, consider changing cleric shield spells so they do not overwrite our Phantom armor line. 39th lvl cleric Armor of Faith spell displaces my 52nd lvl Phantom armor spell AND provides less ac. I cannot even remove a silly cleric shield spell without dispelling myself.<P>The summon elemental spell currently on test is a worthy idea.  If you need examples of bad pathing, here are just a few zones that will get a mage killed trying to drag his/her pet from the entrance to deep within the complex:<P>Mistmoore (pet disappears and reappears at a default, dragging half the zone after it is killed or killing half the zone as it comes back to you)<BR>Sol a and b (same as MM)<BR>Kaesora (same as MM + aggresses mobs in areas adjacent to the floor or walls without attacking or being close)<BR>Droga (paths far away to hit something close up often)<BR>Sebilis (same as MM and Droga)<BR>Plane of Hate (same as MM, Kaesora and Droga)<BR>Lower Guk (same as Kaesora)<BR>Karnors (same as Kaesora. Let me invite you to the basement or closet sometime if you have problems duplicating this trainbringing catastrophe)<BR>Ocean of Tears (pathing near but not in water sometimes puts the pet too far away for orders or spell effect despite standing very close)<BR>Timorous Deep (same as OOT)<P>Charm elemental. Duration should not be as good as chanter in any case, but it makes sense. Necros get this for undead, druids get this for animals, and we should get this for elementals. Yet another kind of crowd control without blast blast blast. <P>For post 50 fire pets:<BR>If you stay with the wizard class fire pet, remove the O'Keils, dispel magic, gate and change the fire resistance to be the same as a 49th lvl fire pet, complete with fireshield.  HPs should be higher and keep the melee damage the same or keep the hps and raise the melee damage.  This doesn't have to be even 56 or 48 damage max per attack, but it should be improved.  Basically, you don't want it any more powerful than the other three post-50 varieties, but keeping it somewhat equal damage-wise would be the goal here.  Maybe the testers found a unique use for the spell as it exists, which is great, but having a viable pet type you can pull up all the time and use consistently is much more appealing.  Make something we can use regularly, not something that will fit a single encounter in the game (I'd consider pre-50 pets for raids over the post 50 fire if that gives you perspective, regardless of the mob we are up against).<P>Many nag about having few options for getting away from things. Consider a spell called Gust of Air.  Self-only, very small duration 20-30 seconds, gives you a 'push' of sow/cheetah speed. Usable only once every 10 minutes. This usually is enough to get away from things without being overpowering. NOW, with that said, try to blow holes in it. What are the potential abuses?<P>Spell drops:  We have many 54-60th lvl mages in guild who do not have 54 water pet spell because no one wants to trade a dragon loot or god loot for the lucky few who do find it.  The same thing though to a smaller degree goes for the 55th lvl spells, especially Call of the Hero.  Heck, I'd rather do hard quests that guarantee I may obtain these spells instead of hoping to find them with their current drop rate.  <P>The FA pet is terrific, I have no complaints really on this except for game mechanics:  The pet is too big to fit through some doors/entrances, so you have the pet jumping to the default point in the zone, causing problems like I explained in MM.  Additionally, please consider making the pet look like all four elements, or some color combination like you see enchanters in elemental form with colored clothes.  And of course, shrink it slightly to avoid the door problem.<P>Pet names:  I prefer &lt;Caster name&gt;'s pet to the names you have now so people can tell easier who your pet is.  However, from a PvP perspective, this may be a bad idea for giving away identity/location.  Using a nickname that the player designs leaves far too much room for abuse.<P>Robe of Conjuration:  Cadeau, a 56th lvl spell, does seem more appropriate alongside Robe of the Bonecaster's 57th Conjure Corpse.  The casting time is fairly long, and by 53rd I rarely if ever used this outside of Boon of Immolation.  However, I'd object to putting this buff on legs.  Despite the introduction of Burnout IV, burnout III may never be used after 55, but the function is appropriate for pet buffs pre-55.  <P>Pet Health Bar:  Please yes.  On the full window option especially, this would be nice.  Controlling a pet in many zones with bad pathing requires full attention.  Having access to the mob's hps is appropriate.<P>Thanks for taking the time to put this together, Absor.  We appreciate being heard.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>PET ATTACK RADIUS<P>This has been over looked. High level pets have a truly huge attack radius, equal to a giant. And this is a MAJOR problem.<BR>Why? Taunting in battle is mostly based on RANGE  more than anything else. <BR>See what happens when a necro pet and mage pet fight a mob at the same time. The necro pet ALWAYS gets hit because it gets in the mob's face!<P>Why is this bad? it means high lvl pets can't taunt worth a damn, and we need them to taunt! Please mske it that pets attack from a fixed distance, roughly equal to a typical warrior PC.<BR>This will make sure in a group the pet takes some damage, and soloing taunts off the poor mage!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Bump Svarinya's idea for being able to select pet-only damage as part of the personal hits option.  Especially as you go up in level, it is harder to determine whether your pet is weak or powerful, and weeding through hundreds of hits by other players doesn't make this useful.  Similarly, it would be great for NPC spells to include pet-only options.<P>Thanks!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I like many of the topics listed as the main thread.  There is one thing I would like to add.  Our staff and weapons summons need fixing.  When EQ first cam out these were awesome weapons.  Now after EQ has matured, these weapons just stink.  Either upgrade the current weapons so that we might or someone else might actually use them.  Or give us some new ones (please give us a 1hb weapon summons).<P>Lastly, give us some summons that no other player can make with a trade skill or can cast themselves.  Give us something that makes the Magician class distinctive.  Too many caster classes have some sort of pet now.  Pets no longer make us distinctive.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello all:<P>I like many of the suggestions I have read. I am not a post 50 mage so I will not comment on these issues with one exception. Below are my takes on some of the issues.<P>Pet Control:<BR>Mages need a means to clear the pets hate list. I think adding this to "/pet back off" is good but  "/pet as you were" would be better. Sometimes I want to pull my pet off one mob in order to take on the one that is beating on me, so having this in "/pet as you were" would be a bigger benefit. "/pet guard me" or "/pet follow me" should make the pet follow the caster much closer. Even if this means having the pet jump every so often. Being able to summon a pet to ones side (ala CoH) is a good start, but is does not solve the problem for lower level characters. If the mage is SoW'd and the pet is not, the pet should stop after the mage gets out of range, the mage should see "master I lost you". This will keep mages from getting the bonus of them and there pet moving at SoW speed if only the mage is SoW'd. "/pet guard here" should mean that the pet returns to that exact point after battle. In the assassin/supplier room in L. Guk, if the pet goes down the ladder after a MoB the pet gets stuck at the bottom of the ladder. I now need to kill the pet and re-summon. Improving pathing in dungeons would help a lot. Especially bad are Mistmoore and Unrest. These zones are often called "no pet zones".<P>Pets in groups:<BR>The additional power a pet brings to a group is not in dispute. But there are a few minor issues to be resolved. Bard songs and Group spells (group SoW, DS and regen) do not affect the pet. They should. The pet is part of the group. Also, targeting the pet by other players should be accomplished by hitting the mages F# key twice. This will allow healers to quickly target the pet and chanters to buff them. <P>Mages in groups:<BR>Mages need to bring more to a group than DD. For example, wizards bring powerful nukes and the ability to evac the group. Some I like are:<P>Gate stones: These allow individuals in the group to gate themselves to their bind points. Not as desirable as evac, but effective.<P>Bind stones: Give these to a tank so they can bind themselves at an allowed bind point (a city, the arena, etc).<P>Superior Bandages: These would increase the effectiveness of bind wound and allow the individual bind to 100% (or 75%). This would neither replace a healer nor remove the need for one in a group. Healers are needed to keep party members alive during combat. These need to be used in combination with the bind wound skill, so they can only be used during down time. <P>Modulating Rods: Why is this item Lore? Even a non-lore Modulating Rod has a limited use. Let mages pre-summon as many as they need.<P>Elemental Armor line: Let mages cast this spell on others. It is a useful buff and allowing us to cast it on others would not degrade the need for other classes in a group.<P>Flame shied line: Increase the duration of this spell. Currently this last for 1 to 2 pulls. Not very effective for the mana required. Most tanks do not bother asking for this.<P>Spell drops and research:<BR>I do like the idea of having rare spells because it makes each caster within a class unique. But key spells should not be rare or hard to get. I believe Summon Monster and Elemental Maelstrom are variants on key spells and can be kept rare without impacting the class as a whole. A mage would still have their pets and shock of swords and is still very effective. Even at lower levels some research components are too hard to find. Words of Coercion are plentiful post level 29, but are needed for level 24 pets. Essence of Rathe and Words of Incarceration are needed for level 44 pets, but are found in dungeons inhabited by level 50+ groups. What I am reading about the post 50 spells is very discouraging. Increasing the drop rate is one solution. In addition add these spells to other areas. Have some of the spell that only drop in Kunark also drop in Velious and Antonica. Making these spells rare is like requiring a Warrior or a Monk to camp a MoB waiting for their ability to drop. Finally, why not let casters research the post 50 spells? It is odd that research becomes useless after 49. <P>Pet Weapons:<BR>I would like to see an upgrade to SoR or weapons that proc against other types of MoBs. Do not exclude items with buffs though. A +3Agi spear, a +3 str sword, etc.<P>Focus Items:<BR>It is frustrating that our focus items cap at level 49 and that the replacements are extremely rare drops. Let focus items work post 49. The additional power of the Rods of Mastery is a big enough draw for me to pursue them across the planes. At what point does the exe ax cap out for warriors? Why then should our focus items cap out at all?<P>I do not believe mages should get a clarity type spell. Our clarity comes from our efficient use of mana. The suggestion for removing the mage LD penalty should be enough. I do like all the spells added to the test server. These are good additions without making our class to powerful. Many of them though should be reduced in level. Since mage's resist fear is pet specific why not drop that down to level 20? Others have made some great recommendations in this area.<P>I hope this helps,<P>Maestron Spellforge<BR>44 Mage of Luclin<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
