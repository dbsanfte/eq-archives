</FONT><HR>Rebuttal to the misinformed Warriors saying Paladins and SKs are close in tanking.<P>You should be pointing at Monks and Rogues, they have higher AC than PAL/SHD at 60.  Talk about the end-game, that is where things need to be balanced.<P>You want to look at our "close" tanking ability?<P>PAL/SHD vs. WAR (Defense)<P>Defense:  230/252 - 91.2%<BR>Hit Points: 75-85% (85% for argument's sake) A dwarf paladin has 87% of the hitpoints of a human warrior.<BR>Dodge: 155/175 - 88.6%<BR>Parry: 205/230 - 89.1%<BR>Riposte: 200/225 - 88.9%<BR>Wearable Armor: (Cobalt vs. Blood Ember/Deepwater) 177/220 - 80.4%  &lt;--- well lookee here...that is a HUGE gap considering all 3 are plate classes.  Plate is plate.  Keep in mind PAL/SHD LOW offense caps NO dual wield.  On the other side of the hybrid coin, Rangers get same/similar weapons warriors have, and they DO do comparable melee damage, whearas PAL/SHD cannot tank comparably well as WARs - not even in the same ballpark 55+.  You bring up the 1100AC 'softcap' - I say prove it - and btw - monks and rogues are having an easier time hitting that number 55+ than PAL/SHD are.<P>Total Defense Ability vs. Warrior if all things considered of equal importance(0.912*0.85*0.886*0.891*0.889*0.804):  Paladins and Shadowknights tank 43.7% as well as a Warrior.<P>Considering only Defense Skill, Hit Points and Wearable Armor : 62.3% (let's be generous and say PAL/SHD tank 65% as well as warriors.)<P>Want to look at rate of taking damage?  Just Defense Skill and Wearable Armor then (I'll be generous and exclude riposte,dodge, parry caps).<BR>That comes out to PAL/SHD are 73.3% as good as warriors.<P>Disciplines have a HUGE effect on desireability and usefulness on raids, that cannot be denied.<P>And you guys vastly understate the damage output you have 55+.  Depending on weapons it is possible for you to outdamage monks on occasion.  Rangers very rarely can outdamage wars *if* they have the very best weaponry and use all their mana.<P>Do you guys remember before Kunark came out?  PAL/SHD were balanced with warriors then.  Warriors had 0-10 more skill points in defense/offense/weapon skills.  Warriors were always preferred over PAL/SHD to tank due to more HP, more AC and also providing more damage output, but if a WAR could not be found, a PAL/SHD could fill in.  That is no longer true.<BR>Kunark widened the gap in skills a large amount vs. hybrids.  You got disciplines that affect the entire way the game is played - yes SOME suck - but SOME have a MAJOR effect on raids.  You got useful spells on armor (while hybrids got spells they already had) - a paladin still can't invis.  I'd wager the invigorate on your BP gives less downtime than a ranger healing to full and then medding to full.<P>If you want to say hybrids are so close in tanking, give numbers.  Or, leave them out of the discussion.<P>Melee and hybrids are only wanted in groups or raids for one of two things in this game: tanking OR damage dealing.  Warriors are in both categories.  The versatility of hybrids is very rarely a consideration.<P>Monks/Rogues/Rangers are meant to be only damage dealers (yet monks rogues out-tank PAL/SHD 55+)<BR>Paladin/SHadow Knights are meant to be only tanks with some utility/versatility.  Their damage output is quite low (50-75% of war damage - 75% is really pushing it, that is extremely rare, war must be using 2h, pal/shd using epic-).<P>Tanking is very needed - but you only need ONE player to take damage in a group.  After that you want all the damage-dealers you can get.  So yes PAL/SHD are forced to compete with Warriors for that one tanking position, and we lose that battle every time.  OK, lets say your group now has a warrior.  A second warrior, paladin, and shadow knight are available - who do you choose?  Usually the warrior, as they do far more damage.  You *might* want the paladin if you have no cleric - how often is that true?  You *might* want the shadow knight, if you don't have a proficient puller - but so many classes can take that role proficiently enough.  These considerations also apply to raids on a larger scale.<P>Again, Monks and Rogues are a greater threat to your tanking position 55+.  For PAL/SHD, you must admit, that much must be corrected.<P>IMO, the Warrior discussion thread should be focusing on the broken melee system (min dmg thing, STR only giving possible higher max hit instead of avg hit increase etc.) in EQ and the fact that stats have so little effect on it.  And Taunting issues.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think one of the biggest problems I see is that there is not real benefit to using a shield, which warriors typically always did outside of EQ. Or rather, there is benefit but it doesn't make up for the loss in dmg output, so no one uses them just about. <BR>Is it possible to make it so that when a shield is in use, the 1-hand weapon being used gets treadted as a 2-hander for dmg bonus so that there will be some balance in the dmg output? Maybe only if a slower 1-hander like the wurmslayer is used they get the 2-hand dmg bonus, but the faster ones only get the 1-hand bonus?  <P>That way, my woodelf warrior could bash without all the swapping, or loss of dmg. Plus, I could get a nice shield and actually wear it !!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Regarding the 56 and 59 lvl dicsiplines... I don't think they are in the wrong order. Riposte only works on creatures attacking from the front. The 59 one stops all creatures from hitting in melee. It's not a redundant or less powerful disciple at all. They have different purposes and each is more useful in some situations. In theory anyway.<P>The problem is that the 56 discipline is broken. It will riposte ALL attacks, even ones from behind. When mobs attack from behind while this discipline is active you riposte the attack, taking no damage. Then you get a message saying you can't see your target so the mob takes no damage either. Working as it does, the lvl 56 disciple is much more powerful than it should be and negates all advantages of the level 59 discipline. The level 56 disciple needs to be fixed (nerfed) so it only affects mobs attacking from the front. <P>The 56 discipline also makes some weapons really powerful that are normally almost useless, such as the Weighted Axe (45dmg 150del). Riposte uses the damage rating of the weapon currently held for the counter attack, ignoring any delay. Against a mob with a fast attack rating, especially against multiple mobs, the ripostes with a 45 dmg weapon are simply amazing. <P>The 56lvl warrior discipline is bugged, over-powered, and needs to be looked into. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just to correct a statement made by gregon ironheart above. paraphrasing: 25% less offense and 25% less defense is 50% less not 25% less than a warrior.<P>I don't know where you learned how to use percentages but that is now how it's done.  If a Sk's offense is 75% of that of the Warrior and the defense is 75% of a warrior does that now mean that the SK now is 150% better than a warrior?  Of course not.<P>With that reasoning if SK's were less efficient at something by only 1% then you would only have to point at 50 skills that were only 1% less efficient and you would be making the argument that SK's are only 50% as good as a warrior.... <P>Okay so i took it to a ridiculous extreme.... point is... learn math and Phite Litericy (in case you can't get it the last one is a joke).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I play a warrior, and theres not much i find bad about the class, I was really excited when i heard that bind wound was going up to 70% for monk and warrior (rogue?), and then my hopes were dashed to find out that yes... by the time i am level 60 i will be able to bind to 70%, would it be unbalancing for us to recive the bind to 70% at 51 as monks do? Monks already have mend, which heals 25% of their life regardless of how much life they have.... I know someone else mentioned a change to this skill earlier, but i dont think it should be "improved" in that way, other than lowering the level at which a warrior achives the ability to do it.

</FONT><HR>Ok i think that warriors crit and crippling blows should be like back stab. Meaning the warrior pushes a button to use. I dont like having it random. I think warriors would like it more if we controlled it. <P>Also yes warriors do need more ac. I have a lvl 54 warrior in full hate armor and cobalt arms and gloves and i have the same ac as a lvl 54 monk with armor thats nothing specail. How is that? <P>Yes we need more hps too. Wow we have 300 hps then other classes we can take 2 more hits then ever other class that makes us so much better.... NO!!!! it doesnt we need more hps <P>Ok ever tank class complains that warriors are so much better and they need more ac and hps to match us.  Ever see a warrior solo a room in guk?  I have seen a sk solo 5 rooms in guk at same time.... I have seen pallys solo with there famus dw helm.... I know monks that solo there way to 60.... Ya let me tell you the warroirs are so much better then those classes. YOu all better nerf us warriors now we are to strong. Really give me a break.  They are so much more powerfull then us warriors, and that is a fact. Ever see a warrior solo something blue, it is a rare ocasion, and when he does he has to sit for hours to get to full hps again. No i am not asking to be made better to solo, i dont want to solo. But i do want to be more effective in higher lvl areas in a group and to do that we need more ac more hps and better taunt. I really get mad when i see pallys and sks and rangers say the want as much ac and hps as a warrior, they have spells. YOu should have never given them disciplines and since ya did you really should give warriors monks and rogues more.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>re: greg's statement<BR>1. he shouldn't be combining offense and defense together in such a calculation, they don't add up all that well together - but IF they did, and IF your numbers are correct (75% defense 75% offense)<BR>You'd go 0.75 * 0.75 = 56.3%<BR>and say: A shadow knight is 56.3% as good as a warrior in melee combining/considering both tanking and damage dealing.<BR>You might be able to say is 56.3% as useful as a warrior in a group if you do not count SK spells.

</FONT><HR>Absor -<P>Let's try again  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>What warriors don't need:<BR>- changes to bind wounds (when we're grouped, it doesn't matter 90% of the time)<BR>- invisibility on cobalt legs (90% of the warriors will likely never see cobalt legs anyway and as someone else noted, the only time the legs would be useful is on a corpse run, when we have no armor anyway<BR>- more AC. As people have noted, there appears to be a "soft cap" on AC at 1100. At L54, with only 2 pieces of cobalt (gloves, boots), and still wearing a Skull-shaped barbute (I swear the Kira's in Hate have hidden all the helms  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">, when fully buffed, I can get to around 1050AC. If/when I manage to get either Velious quest armor, Plane of Growth pieces, or more Cobalt, it shouldn't be that hard to hit 1100. <BR>- increased damage. We do fairly well, though frankly, the offense-oriented disciplines are really just eye-candy after Defensive is available.<BR>- new travel abilities. We've done fine to this point, we don't need to run faster, leap continents in a single bound, or anything else like that.<P>I think there are a few misconceptions:<BR>* Warriors have a huge AC advantage over hybrids. Well, maybe we do over Rangers, but most SKs and Paladins of roughly my level have equal or better AC (in part due to higher availability of their Kunark armor, but also due to the shield). And as someone noted, if a Paladin/SK has an AC of 1100, and we have 1200, I'm not sure how much difference it makes (would be interesting to see hard numbers if anyone has them).<P>* Warriors have a big HP advantage over hybrids and other melees.  Okay, we have a sizeable advantage over monks, rogues, and bards. It might even make sense to bump them up a bit. If I recall correctly, the higher level SK in my guild has more HPs than I do, and has only 100 or 200 less than our higher level warrior. If you take into account the fact that most mobs you fight post-50 hit for at least 100 a pop, that's one extra hit. I don't see this as a big advantage.<P>* Our epic is middle of the road. Let me give my perception and you can think about it some more  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">. I figure there are a few ways to measure the effects of the epic:<BR>Q1) comparison to existing items already available for that class<BR>Q2) comparison of how having the epic effects a class in a single group, and on a raid. <BR>Q3) difficulty of the mobs to obtain the epic and drop rate from those mobs.<P>A1) The warrior epic provides a relatively small incremental benefit over other weapons that can be acquired with less difficulty for L50+ folks (A jade mace can be acquired in your 40s). <BR>A2) While the small stat bonuses are nice (especially resistances), they aren't a huge effect. No haste means that you're really not going to do substantially more damage than previously. WHEN the weapon procs, you can taunt about as well as you did with Jace Mace/Lamentation + whatever. On a raid, the incremental damage isn't significant, and the extra taunt effect is marginally useful.<BR>A3) Requires rare drop off Maestro (1 in 10, maybe?), uncommon drop off Spiroc Lord (5th Isle sky), uncommon Queen of Chardok (pre-Velious, deemed the toughest mob in the game outside Veeshan's peak) in an area where fast respawn makes multiple attempts problematic, scales from 2 Kunark dragons (granted, the EJ dragon is probably the easiest of the various Kunark dragons, maybe the fish is easier), uncommon drop from CT's Lieutenants (Larry, Curly, and Moe). <P>It was stated by Abashi previously that there wasn't really any attempt to balance the quest difficulty or quest rewards across classes (I find this curious). But you must admit there will be comparisons made.<P>Most of the items for other classes (with the exception of the SKs and Wizards that need rare drops off Cazic Thule, and the Magicians who need the various rare-drop staffs) tend to be "always drops" off difficult mobs. Chardok King for clerics, Chardok Prince for enchanters, for example. <P>And looking at the effects of the cleric and enchanter items on a raid (mana-free revivisence, mana-free haste), in my opinion, those have a much bigger effect on the game. <P>I'm _NOT_ suggesting the power of the warrior epic needs to be increased. If you opt to keep it unchanged, I would suggest you make some of the items "always drops" or at least up the frequency some. My personal suggestion would be to have the Spiroc Lord wingblade be an "always drops", since it's such a hassle to get to the 5th isle in sky. Increase the Maestro hand drop rate to 1 in 4 at least (1 in 10 seems unnecessarily cruel, especially when the planes are so crowded). And make the Chardok queen drop rate &gt; 50%. I'd like to see it as an always drop, but if you feel that's too unbalancing, how about 60% instead of 40?<P>Currently, it's an "Epic Luck" quest. If you're lucky, you get to do everything once. Otherwise, you get the dubious distinction of having defeated some of the most difficult mobs in the game with a band of worthy comrades, enduring many deaths, corpse recoveries, and some frustration, only to decide that it's easier to get one of the new Velious weapons that puts the epic in 2nd place for damage/taunt anyway.  And that would be a shame.<P>Finally, since I've probably worn you out already, please take a closer look at the effectiveness of Taunt, post-L50. I don't feel like I need an AE taunt ability, but when my shaman sticks a slow on a blue creature, it would be nice to be able to have a reasonable chance of taunting off him before he's dead  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">. Maybe something as simple as increase the effectivness of taunt _slightly_ for each level of the warrior above L51. Nothing huge, I'm not asking for 100% effectiveness, just something that would at least let the mob bounce to me once in a while, before it decides it would rather go kill the monk  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>After playing a warrior for 70+ days up to lvl 55, i find few things lacking in our class and most have been covered.  My thoughts:<P>1. Hit Points/AC is fine relative to the other classes, however if the other "tank" classes get an upgrade it has to be passed up.<P>2.  Taunt isn't great especially as we go up in levels.  There was an arguement about the Donal's BP that a warrior and a cleric could kill anything if it couldn't kill the warrior in 30 seconds... except the cleric would be paste after 2 or 3 Cheals.  Taunting off Monks, Rogues, and Rangers was nearly impossible until I got my epic. Speaking of the epic.<P>3.  It would be REALLY nice to have haste on the warrior epic, I understand why it doesn't, i.e. the "damage dealers" got haste (rogue, monk, ranger).  "Damage Takers" didn't.  The epic is still cool and looks great.<P>4.  The difficulty of the warrior quest is perfect.  Don't listen to the Nay-sayers.  We don't have to get a rare off of one of the Gods or VS, or a white dragon scale (possibly the worst item to need of all).  Only problem with the warrior quest is the drop rate on the hand of Maestro, which I hear is VERY low now (like 1 in 20).  Fortunately, I got my hand almost the day the epics went live.<P>5.  AE taunt would be Great!!!! Extremely Dangerous, but GREAT!!!<P>6.  Disciplines, well there are only really 2 disciplines I have ever used or ever plan on using.  Evasive and Defensive.  The rest are just fluff that have WAY too long refresh times.<P>7. I heard something about taking invis off warrior items, please don't rectroactively do this!  It took me forever to get the Chardok BP =P<P>Thanks for listening,<P>Gkaal Cthulu<BR>55 Troll - Jedi<BR>Lotus Cult<BR>Quellious Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>   As the parent melee class I think warriors are pretty much fine. Kunark and the expansion to lvl 60 really brought warriors into thier element. The damage output and tanking ability of warriors was far improved.<BR>   IMO warriors need one mild improvement. Increase SLIGHTLY the chance of triple attack. this will increases the advantage a warrior has for being a warlord while only slightly increasing the damage output<BR>    As a side note. warriors ESPECIALLY are not balanced with regard to race advantages. Ogre warriors have a HUGE advantage over warriors of other races. this is because sta has a large effect on warrior hitpoint and because they cannot be stunned. I know we have hashed and rehashed the importance of various statistics. As it stands agi has almost no effect.  As long as your agi is above 75 you are good to go and if it breaks 95 you are golden.  Why not offset SOME of the advantage large races have by actually making agi do something?  you could have agi act as a factor in determining a succerful dodge or parry skill check. I think this would be an intresting change that could effect ALL classes. The bad element of this suggestion is that it reccomends a fundamental change in the mechanics of the game and some skills. The upside is it really does work across the board so it would have effects on racial balance but not really on class balance. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Melee balance bible:<P>Warriors and rogues are ok versus each other. Monks are pretty close depending on how much you value FD but I wouldn't argue against a slight damage output increase in comparison.<P>It's pretty obvious that melee hybrid spells are not even close to making up the difference in combat abilities compared to pure melees at high levels, especially with pure melees ultimately having access to all these spells and more through effects, procs and potions. Unfortunately increasing the power of the hybrids' spells is out of the question since then balance with parent classes and other hybrids will also get messed up.<P>This leaves us with a nerf pure melees and/or improve melee hybrids' combat melee option. Believe me the same issue is going to come up with rogues, they are quite powerful at 60, and look at all the proof, they are better tanks than hybrids while doing tons more damage. It's just not right.<P>I hate to see classes get nerfed, look at the cleric bp situation. It hurts people to take away something no matter how overpowered it is and IMO the game can continue just fine with warriors, rogues and monks the way they are (minus all the hybrid spells as procs and effects please) so the only answer is a big boost to paladin, shadow knight and ranger melee combat ability.<P>While I would like to see the damage ability of hybrids closer to pure melees the newest weapons and epics help take care of that at higher levels. The only problem is that you need them to be balanced.<P>On the other hand having rogues and monks be better at defense than pals, sks and rangers is absurd, and yes at high levels they clearly are. As a minumum rangers should have the same defensive abilities (ac, hp, skill level caps and discs) as rogues, and sks and pals should be better than all but warriors. I don't see how anyone could call anything less than this balanced. Just giving all melee hybrids the same defensive skill caps and discs as pure melees would take care of this, then balance the rest with armor stats and hp adjustments if needed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A final comment (since I suspect this may be falling on deaf ears anyway)... think carefully about the scenario for which you're tuning...<P>It's a very different picture to compare L55+ large guild members of different classes than it is to compare the average players of those classes.<P>If the concern is that warriors with gear that 5% of the population will have makes them significantly better than hybrids (with or without that "elite" gear), then be very careful that in the process you don't destroy the viability of the folks without full cobalt/berserkers and scimitars of lifestealing and willsappers.<P>Maybe as part of the balancing, you could sample random members of the various classes at L50, 54, 56, and 60 to compare skills, AC, HPs, weapons (and damage), etc.<P>A potentially radical solution could be... adjust some of the warrior-usable weapons perceived to be broken to either be not usable by warriors or to do a bit less damage. In addition, for warriors only, have the taunt effect of all weapons increased (without increasing their damage). <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

They should drop at about the same rate as the other classes.

</FONT><HR>Hey Absor. Some folks didn’t like your comments too much, but for the most part I agreed. As a warrior in his 20’s, I have no complaints. As a class I feel we are balanced, but our skills need some tweaking to improve gameplay. <P>I can solo yellow mobs (not easily) and dish out good damage. I NEVER have a problem finding a group. I regularly group with a paladin that has 180 hit points less than me (this is with HP buffing items), at 5 levels higher. Another friend plays a druid who has about 80 more hit points than I do at 7 levels above me. (I am working from memory, so the numbers may not be exact, but the concept is the same). We ARE more powerful tanks than the other classes. I don’t see any reason why we should have exceedingly huge amounts of Hit Points or AC over the other classes. We are the best tanks, no need to make us the ONLY tanks. If we had a significant amount of HP’s over the hybrid classes, it would unbalance everything and make grouping harder. Let’s assume for a minute that we do have a dominating advantage in AC or HP’s. If a warrior isn’t around, is a group just supposed to sit and wait for one before they can play? What if the warrior in a small guild has the flu and can’t play? Should that ruin it for everyone else? A ranger or paladin can fill in. They may not be as good of a tank, but they can fill the role. It’s the same principle with other classes too. Clerics have the best heals. If there are no clerics around, does that mean a group is out of luck until more healers show up? No. There are other classes that can heal. Maybe not as good, but they can do the job and get along. (If no healers can be found, well then you ARE out of luck) Many of the posts here give the impression that we should be the ONLY choice in tanks. By the same logic, wizards could say that they should be the ONLY class that can cast. Without hybrid classes, EQ would be boring. Instead of strings of posts wanting to be more “equal” than other classes, we’d have strings of posts begging for more variety in the types of characters we can play. <P>A lot of the comments here are “I wish” posts that have no use in reality. It would be wonderful to as warrior be able to bind yourself anywhere you wish, or be able to make all mobs run in fear. A warrior would rule if he could put out as much damage as a caster, or dual wield 2H weapons. But the forum is about giving suggestions on how to make the warrior class more balanced. (i.e. balanced with the other classes) Having these abilities (and others like them) would make warriors so powerful that the game would be thrown totally out of whack. We don’t need to regen faster or heal ourselves. My bind would skill is really low (more on that later) because I’ve never needed it. When I’m tanking, there’s always someone around to give heals. The issue of balance is and always will be tricky. Warriors will always say that hybrids are too powerful. Hybrids will say warriors are too strong. There is no one class that can dominate everyone, and there shouldn’t be.  As for dueling, it doesn’t mean a thing. So what if a monk can beat your warrior toe-to-toe. Unless you’re PvP it makes no difference. <P>Most of these posts are from high-level players with high-level problems. Now, I’m not flaming them, I’ll have those problems someday. Take their word on any problems with the epic quest. But it seems to me that +50 is where all these issues are coming out. Skeegon said “Basically though warriors are tough at low lvls, prolly the toughest up to lvl 10 or so (whoopee), they just don't cut it in the high end game” <BR> The game originally only went up to 50, and it is possible the game still needs some tweaking for levels 50-60. This could be with AC, Taunt, 1H vs. 2H or anything else. I can only comment on my own gameplay experience, and I can’t think of any way the warrior class itself should be changed. But, I DON’T think we should be nerfed! Please don’t nerf us. <P>Like I said, the warrior class doesn’t need to be changed. The changes that I feel DO need to be made are to the skills that warriors have available to them. <P>Disarm should make a difference in combat. If it doesn’t, it needs to be fixed.<P>Bind wound should work better. As I said, I never use it because there are always healers around. I tried it, but it doesn’t really make a difference, and I was out of bandages too quick to raise the skill. I don’t expect to have it function like a greater heal spell. Just let us see a difference when it’s used. I also hate carrying around a million bandages. And, you should be able to practice the skill even if you’re at full health. <P>Taunt needs to be buffed. I still think it works, but it should put us on the top of the mob’s hate list by more than one point, and remember us a little bit longer. <P>We should get to specialize in a weapon, just as casters specialize. <P>This is more combat rather than skill related, but we should also get a noticeable bonus when using a shield. If I’m dual wielding langseaxes, and I decide to put one away and use a shield, I should parry better than I did before. <P>Thanks for your time, and thanks for reading this. (I know you’re reading this, the only the bitter cynical players complain that you don’t.)<P>Elgamin Legola<BR>23 warrior<BR>Cazic-thule<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Abashail, you have proven in your own post that paladins and shadowknights can already tank nearly as well as a warrior.  You are making some mathematical mistakes, though.   <P>  In all of those defensive skills you mention, paladins and shadowknights are 85%-90% as high as warriors in their skill caps.   This means that PALADINS AND SHADOWKNIGHTS CAN TANK 85% to 90% AS WELL AS WARRIORS.   <P>  If it was true that paladins and shadowknights were 75% offensively, and 75% defensively as good as a warrior then they would have...  75% of the melee abilities of the warrior.   NOT 56.3%.   <P>  Think of it this way: suppose we each have 2 baskets, one with oranges, and one with pears.  I have 4 oranges and 4 pears in my baskets.  You have 3 oranges and 3 pears in your baskets. <BR>You have 75% of the oranges I do.  <BR>You have 75% of the pears I do.  And...<BR>YOU HAVE 75% OF THE PIECES OF FRUIT THAT I DO.  <BR>(6/8 = 0.75)  <P>  So, if (as many hybrids are fond of saying) paladins and shadowknights are supposed to be 75% warrior and 25% caster, then paladin and shadowknight defensive abilities need to be nerfed, because currently they are nearly 90% of the warrior levels.    <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif">  <P>  Ok, I don't really think hybrid defensive abilities should be nerfed.  But I think your own numbers, Abashail, give good evidence of the fact that they don't need enhancements in this area either.  <P>  Actually, in my groups, I would much rather have a hybrid than a second warrior.  Two warriors are not much better than one as far as tanking is concerned, because only one is getting hit at a given time, in most cases because most groups have some form of crowd control so that it's pretty unusual to have 2 people actually tanking in a group at the same time.  The hybrid at least brings some other abilities to the table.  And many of those other abilities are VERY nice too.  Just go to a spoiler site and take a look at the spell lists for hybrids post 50.  A hybrid that knows how to use his spells correctly is a pretty awesome thing.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>WEAPON SPECIALIZATION<P>Just as casters get spell specialization, warriors should get weapon specialization.<P>A warrior could train in all specializations, but all except one would cap at 50.<P>The possible benefits of specialization could be....<P>A slight increase in the chance of a criticle hit.<BR>A slight increase in the chance of a cripling blow.<BR>A slight increase in the speed of the weapon (until the speed cap is reached, either by skill or by magic, or a combination)<BR>A slight increase in the minimum damage calculation for the weapon.<P>Here is a few examples just so you know I am not seeing this as some kind of warrior super skill.<P>Criticles:<BR>Lets pretend that the base chance to get a criticle is 5% (I have no clue what it really is but this as good a number as any.)  Specialization would add to this.  At 100 skill you might have a 7.5% chance to criticle.  15% chance at 250.  Only when using that weapon type of course.<P>Crippling Blow:<BR>Same idea... smaller numbers.<P>Speed:<BR>1% speed increase for each 10pts of skill.   So... 10% at 100... 25% at 250<P>Min. Damage:<BR>This doesn't let you do more damage... just makes sure when you hit you do appropriate damage.  A specialized warrior, if he hits, should never hit for 1.<P>I have used linear scales for all these examples for simplicity.. but I think accending scales would be much more appropriate.  A skill increase from 200 to 201 should reap much more benefit then a skill increase of 50 to 51.<P>A hybrid could specialize in any weapon he can criticle in (Rangers.. archery, etc.).  I am not sure.. but I think each hyprid can criticle with one weapon type.  If they can't they should.<P>Morgan.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I Agree with those who posted its about Absor and his lack of knowledge or care about the warrior class.<P>Why? He instantly points out we are the "base" class for other melee types.  Noteing that any changes to us unbalance other melee classes. I know this may sound rude, and I appoligize before hand but it needs to be mentioned.  <P>IMO they need to have people actually sit their butts down and play a non twinked, non level buffed character up to lvl 60 then start asking questions.  Stop pulling these guys in off the street, and asking them to check message boards and see what people want. <P>Heres a fix... Absor get a group of people play each of the classes, meet people in game and get some experiance with each of the classes under your belt.  Then start telling people who have played since beta  their class is balanced and you see no real issues.<P>Sure I see crazy request but I also see some valid points that you seem to be snubbing (2 short post of yours on warriors.  50% of your first post is remarks about people reposting, 25% is what YOU think of warriors.... Whats that have to do with our idea of warrior issues? <P>Please keep your own opinions of what you think about warriors between you and VI.  When you have put 100+days (2400 hours)into your warrior then come talk to us about what you think of warriors.  Until then keep and open mind, honestly look at suggestions with no prejudice (wich you seem to have for warriors), and take notes.  Show us customers some respect and stop TELLING us what YOU think, and LISTEN to what WE have to say. <P>BTW I love playing a warrior and have some issues with them 99% of which have been posted, so I wont repeat them.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>How about a new skill that warriors get around 30 - 40 that when a mob is attacking with a bladed weapon, the warrior gets a chance, like dodge, riposte, etc. to "dull" the weapon and therefore making the weapon hit for less damage by a few points.  I mean, do you think that you could hack away at a suit of plate armor with a nice sword without denting/chipping it?  Not likely.  Of course this should have no lasting effect on the weapon once its dropped...Uness you make it able to be repaired by smiths by sharpening it like a rusty weapon or something like that.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>We're meatshields, make it so.<BR>We're like the wizards of melee, make it so.<P>Right now, taunt is useless.  We often have to resort to dodgy tactics to earn taunt, like switching to a weapon that procs Ykesha to get taunt.  The odds of getting a HARD hitting crit needs to be increased, and crits should have a greater chance of earning taunt than normal hits.<P>We should hit very hard while stamina is high, and progressively digress towards center when stamina gets low... In much the same way a wizard is effective so long as he has mana, but once low on mana (stamina in warrior's case) his rate of damage should decrease.<P>No, I don't expect to ever outdamage a monk, a rogue, a ranger, a shadowknight, or a paladin, but I *DO* expect to be the primary "meatshield".<P>I started my warrior for many of the same reasons I started my wizard.  Efficacy is strong, but the weaknesses are many...  Right now, both my chosen primary classes (wizard and warrior) are not efficient contributors to a group.<P>If a warrior can't get taunt why have them?<BR>Why give me such great defensive abilities?<P>And bandage DOES need to be looked at.  Bandaging to 70% health at level 40 or so is NOT overpowering as solo'ing, even at 70% health, is hardly feasible.  One mob every hour is hardly "soloing", it's more like simply killing an hour until we find a group.  I don't see a problem with that as a group will &gt;always&lt; be FAR more desirable.  Besides, I can ask any druid for a regen and solo.<P>Again, your definition of "balance" is blurred.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"And therein lies the key. Half the warriors can, half can't. That means that taunt works fine for half the warriors, implying that the other half (that you've dealt with) or their party are not working their character to the best of its abilities."<P>Absor, please don't you make it a common practice to assume that your desired explanation is the only possible explanation.  I hate to break it to you, but the explanation given above is very narrow minded and doesn't take into account so many of the factors involved in the way the hate list is arranged.<P>What that monk said has absolutely nothing to do with how "well" somebody plays or that only half the warrior keep taunt maxxed.  Nada zilch zero.  <P>What that monk could very well be saying is that half of the warriors he groups with have good enough weapons (1 handed proc weapons) to keep just close enough behind in damage that taunt can keep the mobs off him.<P>It's almost funny that when somebody makes a comment like that you would immediately come up with an explanation that means no change is needed (i.e. less work for your coders) regardless of whether that's the only explanation.  The only way you're going to fairly balance the classes is if you don't always react with whatever explanation makes life easier for you.<P>Taunt shouldn't just barely work and only work for the 50% of the warriors who have the best weapons in the game.  <P>Abashi and Aradune love to talk about how they just play the game with friends and don't camp to get XP or items.  In other words, they don't think camping should be the only way to play the game effectively.  However, by not fixing taunt you're basically telling us that our only chance of outtaunting the monks and rangers is to camp for the best possible weapons we can possibly get.  Anything less than high output proccing weapons basically makes our taunt skill worthless.  <P>If that's going to be your stance and since you are asking for nerf suggestions might I suggest that you simply remove taunt altogether?  Why even give people the illusion that it will do anything?  Just lay it on the table and tell us the only way to outtaunt other melee types is to have superior weapons and when a warrior doesn't have the very best weapons in the game they will simply be shunned from groups.  Eventually the other classes will figure it out anyway.  I can see it now, "Group looking for tank.  Only warriors with high taunt weapons need apply."  <P>So you add further item dependence and then you say that you'd like to nerf items that grant invisibility.  I agree with nerfing invis because that isn't something that warriors should be self-reliant for.  But I strongly disagree that taunt should be considered working as intended simply because some warriors have better weapons than others.  <P>Remember, those warriors who are able to outtaunt the monk may very well have 2H weapons that they would like to use but instead are forced to use 1H proc weapons because they know nothing else will build enough hate. <P>Now let's talk about hit points and AC too.  You say "no way no how, we're NOT giving warriors more of either."  So what you're saying is that when you retuned the hybrids and rogues there's no chance that you went overboard and made them infringe on the warriors territory too much huh?  <P>This whole concept of "the customer is always lying and they are guilty until proven innocent beyond a shadow of a doubt" seems like a recurring issue with Verant.  Very strange business practice. /shrug</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Having played a warrior exclusively since May of 1999, I have a few observations to make while my class has the floor. Pretty much everything I have to say is in regards to high-level warriors.<P>Taunt- At 50+, this skill is very ineffective, especially compared to the 'taunt-like' effects of rogues, monks, and rangers (increased damage output or spell effects which attract aggro). A warrior's ability to attract an enemy's ire should be commensurate with his ability to absorb damage. It is embarassing to be at near-full health at the end of a fight with a lvl 58-65 mob while dead rogues and monks are strewn about.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> I'd like to see Taunt made more effective, and I am quite keen on the idea of the AE taunt. This would be a big asset.<P>Disarm- Useless skill, and pointless to even practice. The only possible use for it is in duels, and warriors are hard-pressed to win legitimate duels against non-warriors (paladins, SK's, monks) where spells and spell-like effects overwhelm the warrior's advantages. I suppose if Disarm is intended to be primarily PvP, then it works fine; but it is of no value against NPC enemies. Especially in Velious, where every armed opponent carries a magical weapon that cannot be disarmed.<P>Balanced weapon damage- I have used a variety of weapons, and I still have found no compelling reason to consider using anything other than dual 1HS as my primary weapons. Even with the changes to 2H weapons, they still generate less damage over the course of a given fight than fast 1H weapons. I'm not comparing apples and oranges either (well, other than in the obvious way); say for example, a pair of Lamentations (not overly difficult to obtain) vs. a Felhammer (very rare). The Lamentations will outdamage the Felhammer by well over 2 to 1 in any prolonged fight against an exp-giving opponent (based on old-fashioned addition of numbers from the combat log, not parsing of data), even though the ratio of the Felhammer is much more favourable. It's all down to frequency of hits; the weapon that strikes more often is going to be more effective. I would like to see 2H weapons become a viable choice as main weapons; not only from a RP/style POV, but as an actual combat asset. This could be done by increasing high-level 2H damage, increasing the skill cap on 2H (probably not the best option), or even by virtue of an auxiliary function (higher critical modifier, higher taunt chance).<P>Warrior spells- I may be alone in this, but I am not very keen on spell effects from items for warriors that replace the abilities of other classes. Things like Journeyman Boots and similar general purpose items are not a problem; but I don't like seeing warriors with Invisibility and Healing spells built into their gear. There doesn't seem to be a compelling reason for these effects. My own thinking is more along the lines of 'spell effects that enhance the fundamental nature of the class' for item effects. For example, a big ATK buff instead of Invigourate on the high-level warrior chest pieces, or a big poison/disease resist buff on the leg pieces. Strength, Stamina, AC, ATK, speed, and/or resist buffs are what warriors should get as class-specific spell effects. Since most of the warrior spell-effects are not useable in combat anyway, heals and invis are only useful to increase soloing ability, and if you're wearing that armour you sure as hell did not get it solo!<P>Disciplines- Increase the effectiveness of the offensive disciplines, please. Right now, the only discipline I find very useful is Defensive, and occasionally Mighty Strike. The offensive disciplines rarely pay off in terms of results against their lengthy recharge time, while the defensive disciplines are very useful, even essential, in some fights. I suppose I would just like to see disciplines, especially the top five disciplines, tuned to a point where ANY of them could be considered valuable in a big fight. I would especially like to be given some more payoff for opting to go with an offensive discipline over a defensive one. With Fellstrike, for example, I find that damage is usually EXACTLY four times the base damage, on 6 out of 10 hits. This is worthless to me, as I normally hit for that much or more without a discipline in use (using Lamentations, in this case). I'd like for all the current disciplines to be reviewed and tested to be sure they are working properly; if it's a bug or a glitch, then a perfectly good discipline could be going unused because it's not functioning properly.<P>I'd like to see Charge replaced altogether, as it goes totally unused once you get past 52nd level. I'd replace it with a discipline that moves you to the top of an enemy's aggro list for every hit you land for 10 seconds, with a 10-15 minute scaling recharge time. This dovetails with my comments on Taunt, above.<P>Kunark armour- I know it's probably futile, but I'll chime in with my vote to make cobalt helms and bracers just a BIT more available.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> I can't think of any other Kunark armour pieces that are both so extremely rare and come from such extremely dangerous areas. I'm a big believer in patience, perseverance, and luck, but throw us a bone, here. Reet frogloks and myconids are a big enough risk without item drop percentages below 1%.<P>Faolan<BR>CT server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Warriors really need to have their resistances increased. I for one, enjoy dueling. As a warrior<BR>against other classes, true caster classes, in particular, we usually don't stand a chance. In the dueling arena Warriors are clearly unbalanced.I also wanted to comment on an article I read from Absor. You where of the opinion warrior items should have no spell<BR>abilities like see invisibility. First of all this<BR>is a minor spell. This minor spell and others like it are not going to unbalance VI mystical scheme of things. The fact is, playing a warrior can be pretty dull. Little spells like this give us options to make the game more entertaining. There are other items out there that give warriors nice little spell options, but not many.<BR>The goal of VI should be to make all the classes<BR>entertaining. Turning the Warrior to just auto attack and click kick is about as dull as you can<BR>get. I for one, won't be starting a new character once VI ruins mine. I have spent too much of my<BR>time invested in this one. If you want to nerf warriors and nerf warrior items there will be absolutely no reason to play one.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 11 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-11.html">11</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053599&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053599&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
