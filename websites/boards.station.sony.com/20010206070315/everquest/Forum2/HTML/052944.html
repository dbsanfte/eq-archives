</FONT><HR>I just read through Absor's post and the replies to it.<P>I wanted to clarify some things.<P>First, it didn't take 6 months and 300,000 people to find the problem.  The problem was only made apparent recently, with Velious and the removal of the HP cap.  The breastplate didn't appear as a problem until encounters started lasting much longer than they had previously.  We made one attempt to address the issue, found out it wasn't nearly enough, and now are faced with having to do this change.<P>Removal of the HP cap added more variety to the game -- it changed strategies and tactics.  No longer were we forced to simply make mobs kill in a very short period of time.  Overall, this is a very good thing for the game -- variety and encounters that require differing tactics is good.<P>That said, whenever we do change or add behavior or other significant aspects of the game, other unforeseen problems often surface.  It's the nature of the genre -- these game's change and evolve, and every change, small or large, can have unexpected ripple effects.<P>A second clarification:  less than 5 or so mobs in Velious were created assuming the breastplate would be used, and this was mostly likely in error (i.e. we shouldn't have made that assumption in those cases).  We will be addressing those mobs and tuning them down accordingly.<P>In summary, I'm sorry we goofed up -- it does happen.  It will happen again.  It's the nature of the beast, but we will always do our best to minimize these occurrences.  And we will also do our best to react as fairly as possible when we are forced to act, attempting to do the right thing for both the individual player as well as the game as a whole.<P>It is unfortunate that the item was created in the first place, given its potential for problems, and it's also unfortunate that we didn't realize how much more magnified that problem would become when the HP cap was lifted.  <P>That said, again, we're not perfect, and we will continue to make mistakes as long as this game continues to grow and evolve.  And, no matter how dedicated our testing staff is, or how carefully we watch for problems on test, we will miss things that 300,000+ players will find.  I don't see this changing, and I certainly don't think this is something unique to EQ, but rather something inherent to the genre -- no other type of game changes as often and as significantly, nor involves such a huge community of players who both work with and compete with each other.<P>I know that what I've said probably won't stop the flaming, and I know this is disappointing to both players who have the item as well as those who were planning on obtaining it one day -- I don't expect to post and have happiness follow -- but I did want to at least try to explain the situation in more detail, and to clarify it.  And I also think it's important for us to try to manage expectations as they relate to the future.<P>-Brad<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

They are mainly the province of some of the melee classes and the healing classes.  No INT casters required for anything more than the lowest yard trash.  No tactics beyond hack and heal make a real difference on the big guys.  Actual tactics work elsewhere, for now.  Are you planning on putting out any expansions INT casters can enjoy too, or do we destroy the variety of hitting autoattack and doing complete heals just in time?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

That is what leads to these Nerfs.

</FONT><HR>Here is a much better idea. Instead of nerfing the Donal's BP yet again, why not give mobs that are supposed to be tough a fast regen rate like Veeshan's Peak dragons have? Even if Veeshan's Peak dragons did no damage a cleric and warrior alone would never be able to kill them. That would solve the supposed problem of a cleric and a warrior being able to clear entire uber zones by themselves and it would allow the Donal's BP to remain the way it is. Geez, I should work for Verant.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Yes, but regardless of the fine print, theres plenty of unhappy people out there (even those that aren't clerics and don't even have a chance of getting the BP). Its all a matter of reputation and the impression one gets from your actions. <P>Would the possesion of the BP unbalance the game all the way down to level 1 for all classes? No, only the top echelon players and even then only those in uber guilds. Frankly I doubt, Absor's statement that this equipment unbalances the whole game. Leaving the equipment as is or even stopping the loot drop should have been a better solution. <P>BYTW, how can you say that you don't design equipment to be "must haves" when you state exactly the opposite with this:<P>"[we designed] less than 5 or so mobs in Velious were created assuming the breastplate would be used,"<P>In which case, you basically forced the playerbase<BR>(the guilds and their clerics) to make this a compulsory type equipment. Something that you have always said you'd never do. So why not bring back manastones in this case too? Just design mobs around so and so...<P>You do realize that this just perpetrates the game's reputation as "NERFQUEST" and VI's rep as an uncaring (if not downright hostile) company to the playerbase.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Only few people are man enough for that.<P><BR>But according to the problem:<P>The game is based on getting the best items and class-defining items of this style are either too mighty or EACH class needs one.<P>I mean, why do you take away from a class that really deserves such a good thing for having a hard but boring task throughout the game, when there are so many classes that are obviously broken and need improvements? Why do you put your effords into existing rewards and strengths and not into existing bugs and weaknesses?<P>Give such a class defining BP or robe to every class:<P>Warrior: BP that adds 33% HP <BR>Enchanter: Robe that has rightclick-Mezzes<BR>Rogue: Mask that doubles chance of backstabbing or rightclick Antitaunt<BR>Wizard: Rightclick-Lure-Robe<BR>Necro: Summon Corpse or Complete Mana Regain<BR>Paladin: Maybe rightclickable Invulnerability, duration 30 Sec, recast 1 Minute (???)<BR>SK: Same with Magic Immunity (???)<BR>other classes: similar effects - you know their defining abilities better than I do.<P>This is just a thought from a 36 Paladin  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

If I knew your email, I'd email it to you because its personal  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>So if your not brad stop reading =P<P>I hold you in a respect I hold for only a few people.  Like gary gygax and richard garfield, you have created a game that has in many ways altered the way I live and the way I game.  I salute you for it.<P>However, I walked away from M:TG, Richard Garfield's brain child, once they stopped playtesting the cards and simply releasing them.  I'm sure you're aware of the problems that came with cards in the Urza's block, if you dont know... ask some of your office mates that play the game.<P>It was apparant they were 'pushing' content into the game as fast as possible, for various reasons, without giving it the extended playtime they did for legends, ice age, and the like.<P>That is absolute KEY to the life and existance of any game.<P>Its apparant that often things look good on paper but dont work well in the game's enviroment.  It does take at least a small amount of playtesting to realize this.  With the 'rushed' feel of the later half of velious as well as the chaos that was the kunark release... things like this are simply going to happen.<P>So dont let it happen to your games, Brad, if you can manage it at all.  There is no reason for this kind of mistake to ever happen again, as long as you have a 'test' server and can encourage people to come test there.<P>Gygax made these mistakes. Garfield made them too.  Are you?<P>Remember, it may look good on paper, it may look good in an average situation back at the office when 5-6 of the locals boot it up and check it out... but the ONLY way to truly test it, is to have players with as much game savy as they can muster try to break it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>PLAYTEST<BR>THE<BR>ZONES<BR>MOBS<BR>ITEMS<BR>BEFORE<BR>SELLING<BR>THE<BR>CONTENT<P>Thank you  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>From Absor:<BR>"How are we supposed to find a trick that it took 300,000 people 6 months to figure out? "<P>Umm using a BP that casts CH to CH someone is a trick?  Please explain.<P>Can you please address how impractical the 30 sec cast on the BP was alone let alone another nerf to reduce the BPs usefullness even more?<P>To show you the absurdity... Another quote from Alan<P>" hope that the impact that this game dynamic has on the game is obvious to everyone. If we allow this item to remain in the game as it is, we will have to change the game so that monsters are capable of killing a warrior in 30 seconds. 15 seconds if the group consists of two clerics with this breastplate and one warrior, and it gets worse from there..." <P>Let's take his 2 cleric 1 war scenario.  So you are telling me in order for this to work the first cleric MUST be casting his Donal's BP CH 15 secs BEFORE BATTLE EVEN STARTS!?!?!  So then you are fighting and the clerics each get off a CH and the Mob agros the clerics ...then what?  Dead clerics.  And ultimately dead warrior.  Absor's example was of a 3 man group taking ANY mob that can't kill a warrior in 15 secs.  I just showed you how that isn't true.<P>Second...<P>"There are some cases where a character would have all of his buff slots full and be unable to gain a new buff. This new Donal's effect would be, essentially, a buff. We can either have it overwrite a current buff, or have the spell fail if the character has a full load of buffs on him. I can see arguments for either implementation, and I want to hear your thoughts on it." <P>OMG ROFLMAO!!!  So not only are you nerfing the BP but you are going to implement a broken effect?  EITHER of these situations occuring would be a broken effect.  You know the easiest way to fix this?  Write code to give items recast times.  Would solve a whole heck of a lot of problems.  You could give the BP a 10 sec cast and 1 min recast.  This would make the BP only usable every 70 secs but would make both the BP and the cleric useful in an encounter.  Even the yet to be nerfed BP takes the cleric out of combat for 30 SECS!  What happens when that giant AoE goes off mid Donal's cast, or the Mob decides to pick on another target, or worst of all scenarios (but by far the most common) the Bp goes off on a corpse. <P>My favorite quote from that post:<BR>"Of course, if we make the world so hard that this breastplate is not overwhelmingly powerful..."<P>I'm sorry... but I really don't know of that many high lev encounters where a Warrior can stand up to a Mob one on one for more than 30 secs.  Perhaps using their defensive disc but there is a time limit on that as well.  This disc lasts for 1 min I believe?  I'm assuming that these mobs arn't mobs a cleric could just cast two Chs on to beat (otherwise that would be just as easy).  1min War disc/30 sec Donal's BP = 2casts of CH.   <P>I really would like a list of the mobs in which this BP is deemed 'overpowering' because a warrior can stand up to the Mob for longer than 30 secs.  I have a few in mind but can see pretty much the same result with or without this BP so I really fail to see how it is the class defining uber BP you are claiming.<P>Most clerics I know have switched over to that bright yellow BP from growth... Breastplate of Stability or something?  casts Celestial Healing because it is much more usable in grouping/raiding situations.<P>End note: If you want to change the BP to a CH one person per cast please reduce it to the original 20 sec cast (I personally think it should be 10 secs, same as CH, as it has its own drawbacks which is 1 per customer).  Otherwise I would really much rather see a cast time 10 secs with a recast time of 60 secs.  That limits the amount of times in a battle you can use it, although it doesnt fully nullify its effect. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Brad, with all due respect, you confuse the hell out of me. LOL<P>Have you been to Velious? I mean, have you played there and tried out any of these mobs? They are nuts. I dont know what game youre playing, but it sounds pretty cool. I know the one Im in has mobs that resist all but one, maybe two spells from one maybe two caster classes. They also have insane hit points. I notice you mentioned that your game has that too, but yours allows variety for tactics. Howd they do that? In my game, the players are pretty much the same, but the mobs got meaner. Its still the cast, med/heal med game it always was. Tactics? heh heh Not when 9 of the 14 classes are pretty much useless in these encounters...of course unless youre talking about befor and after the fights. Then everyone has something to do, from buffs, to corpse janitorial services. <P> You say one thing, then turn around and say another. I dont mean this post to sound like its a flame, but I cant think of exactly how I wanted to say it. Its almost like you dont want people to succeed in this game. I can understand that you have to take on the "adversarial dungeon master" role, but is it adversarial, or is it spiteful?<P>All I know is the game you sometimes describe is not the game I am playing. Maybe theres some secret that Im missing out on somewhere.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>here's a suggestion I have for this.<P>A lot of clerics at higher levels have macro's that they use to verbalize who they're healing so that 2 clerics or 2 healers don't waste mana by healing 1 person at the same time.<P>Because of this new change, it presents a huge problem.  What if a cleric isn't aware that a tank was just healed by the bp (there is often inter-group healing), and tries to bp that tank?  What if a cleric mis-clicks in the middle of battle and uses the bp on the wrong tank?  Even if the tank says, "I was just bp healed," or cleric interrupts himself/herself the cleric can do NOTHING for 30 seconds until the bp is done casting.  This being the case, it should now be immediately interruptable.  You've just taken an item and made it nearly useless compared to what it used to be.  Now it can even screw up an entire battle.<P>That is all.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I wanted to add a little more detail and some of my thoughts about ripple affects whenever significant changes are made to a game like this.<P>When we increased the level cap, there were unforeseen consequences.  And so we had to make adjustments.  This understandably upset some players -- in fact, any change to the status quo can be upsetting to many.<P>Now that we've increased the HP cap, there are also some unforeseen consequences.  The breastplate is just one -- the perceived problems you've posted about class balance and usefulness as a result of the HP cap removal might may well be other consequences (and we're already starting to debate and discuss them).<P>Undoubtedly, we'll have to make more adjustments, bringing the game back closer to balance.  Some of these changes will probably be negatively perceived by some players, and hopefully others will be positively perceived.  But, honestly and bluntly, the short-term happiness or disappointment is secondary in our decision making process.  We fix and adjust and balance, especially after changes like this, to ensure the overall health of the game, because we fundamentally believe that our focus on the game's overall health and balance is what brings long term happiness to our playerbase.  <BR>The alternative, really, is a static, unevolving game.  If we don't try things out that we never planned to do, like increasing the level cap, or the MOB HP cap, then we risk a stagnant game.  The genre is still new, and yes, in a sense, EQ will never be out of 'beta'.  It's an experiment in many ways, because something like EQ hasn't really been done before -- there are very few games out there even close to EQ in terms of goals and scope. <P>The same goes for items.  We've tried some new item ideas out in an attempt to make the game more interesting and varied.  These include this breastplate, the manastone, mistwalker, etc.  And yes, unfortunately, these also caused unforeseen consequences.<P>I submit, however, when considering the big picture and the game as a whole, it's better that we try this stuff than not.  I also believe in my heart, all things considered, that EQ is a far better game today than it was 6 months ago, and waaaay better than it was when we launched.  And, overall, I know it will continue to improve, and so also will our future games be all the more better given what we've learned, both from our successes AND our failures and mistakes.<P>I guess what I'm trying to say, or do, is manage expectations better, going forward.  Perhaps another MMORPG will come along that never nerfs, never makes mistakes, but still evolves and expands, with a perfect dev and testing team, eager to try new things, but somehow impervious to failure.<P>But I really doubt it... years of MUDing and game development experience tell me otherwise.  And, in any case, until then, we're going to march forward, doing our best, with a strong commitment to continue to both improve EQ and also expand EQ, be it with more content, more options, improved technology, etc.<P>Heck, we're already talking about some major additions to gameplay (not just new content) that we're going to make after we make a serious stab at getting the classes balanced in the next few months.  I can't go into details yet, but I think they'll be great.  But I also think, realistically, that we'll face challenges associated with the changes - in any case, though, we are going to continue pushing EQ beyond its original scope and vision.<P>I appreciate all of you who've stayed with us this long, and I encourage you to stick with us going forward -- we certainly couldn't have done it without you  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  And while I wish some of your expectations were a bit more realistic and forgiving, I'm at the same time very glad we have this board so you all can keep us on our toes -- it's an invaluable resource.<P>take care,<P>-Brad<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>**<BR>Removal of the HP cap added more variety to the game -- it changed strategies and tactics. No longer were we forced to simply make mobs kill in a very short period of time. Overall, this is a very good thing for the game -- variety and encounters that require differing tactics is good.<BR>**<P>You mean adding lemming runs? Not our idea of fun.<P>**<BR>A second clarification: less than 5 or so mobs in Velious were created assuming the breastplate would be used, and this was mostly likely in error (i.e. we shouldn't have made that assumption in those cases). We will be addressing those mobs and tuning them down accordingly.<BR>**<P>Yeah I sure hope you address these issues. My guild has been killing Trakanon for the last few months and ya know what, we have ONE CLERIC BP (which I won).<P>*ONE*<P>Guess why. Pure bad luck.  We always seem to get other class bp's and manna robes (which is perfectly fine, but since Velious FORCES US to NEED cleric bp's we have been hoping for more).  So guess what, we're screwed when it comes to you "vision" that every cleric should have one of these breastplates in order to kill a mob.<P>You know why you made this mistake?<P>YOU DON'T PLAY THE GAME LIKE WE DO.<P>Have you actually sat around with 30-40 people and tried to kill something like the uber mobs in Velious?<P>Do you actually play on a regular basis at a high level to see what EVERYONE ELSE DOES.<P>Your own quote proves my point.<P>****<BR>And, no matter how dedicated our testing staff is, or how carefully we watch for problems on test, we will miss things that 300,000+ players will find. <BR>****<P>Maybe if you were one of those 'players' you would see how things really are in this game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>People make mistakes, and this is not just seen in EQ.  Correct, but people pay for their mistakes too.  Regardless of how you talk around the issue, you designed the high end game play, and epic battle encounters to last upwards of 30-45 minutes.  With mobs that Quad for 540, 700 etc, a CH every 30 secs can NOT hold a warrior down.  A warrior will die in about 8 seconds of direct combat even with just the Dain hitting for 425.  This BP is not unbalanced, and has become an important item in this game.  This is a huge mistake, and as people begin to leave your game bit by bit as other games come out, I hope you realize this.<P>At the same time, I want to thank you for taking Absors foot out of his mouth.  It's a really nice fit, but I think its really nice of you to cover his behind.<P>MOST guilds do not have more than 1 or maybe 2 donals BP's, and I mean  uber guilds.  FOH are and have always been your "chosen" guild.  The fact that they have a lot of Donals Breastplates does not mean it is an unfair item.  If you have 15 donals breastplates, and a 60 war with uber gear, you have your clerics hit BP CH every 2 seconds, and over and over again, your warrior will get a CH every 2 seconds constantly.  Guess what?  Most servers will NEVER see 15 Donal's BP's, let alone any one guild.  ahh I'm tired of wasting my time, I'm sure this will fall on deaf ears.  Just realize that you need to change the mobs, and TEST them, before you change the BP.  People will not stand for a game that can not be played.<P>/rant off<P>Just think, and while newbies may agree with you, you are tugging your most loyal customers around by the hair on their....well you get the idea.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>TTuuaann:  We do play the game.  Really.  I promise  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>We have people on the dev team, in testing, in customer service, in operations, in upper management, etc., who love and play the game, who play hour after hour, who work on the game all day, and then head home to play it into the wee hours of the night.<P>We have power gamers, role players, and casual gamers.  We have low level players, mid level players, and high level players.  We even have people in many of the well-known 'uberguilds', and let me tell you, I really wish sometimes I could let you know who they were -- it might be a big surprise  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  But so that they can do their jobs without the perception of favortism or even cheating, I can't.<P>In fact, at this point, there are probably more dedicated EQ players on the EQ Live team than there ever has been, and I believe we're more in touch with the game than ever before.<P>So, there you have it.  Yes, we make mistakes and screw up in our attempt to make EQ an even better game, but it's simply NOT because we don't play it.<P>We DO play it.<P>-Brad<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"A second clarification: less than 5 or so mobs in Velious were created assuming the breastplate would be used, and this was mostly likely in error (i.e. we shouldn't have made that assumption in those cases). We will be addressing those mobs and tuning them down accordingly"<P>WE. WANT. DETAILS. <P>You are about to massivly change the way the game works, and visit YET ANOTHER nerf upon the cleric community, and we don't want fuzzy comments, or 'We won't release that information'. <P>You have decided that we weren't playing your game the way you wanted it played, and have declared it to be a game of Calvinball, where the rules are no longer fixed from day to day.<P>People don't want to go out and die half a dozen times all over again because you decided to change Mob X, Y, but not Mob Clone Z around the corner, who is still Mobflated, oops, sorry, that data didn't export correctly.<P>Questions :<BR>-----------<P>What are those mobs ? Just names will do, no zones needed.<BR>How far advanced is the planning *** AND THE PLAYTESTING *** ? <BR>How many people are on your Playtesting team ?<BR>Are they using GM Cheats to test these mobs such as /cast 13 ?<BR>What timeframe is there between nerfing the Breastplate, and the changing the mobs so they are actually killable ? One week ? One Month ? Unknown ? <BR>Is it true that the Donals changes will go into the next patch with the mobs still inflated ?<P>See, a lot of us find it hard to believe that you put 'less then 5 or so' of these mobs into the game. That is a number of between 4 and 10 mobs that you are going to 'Tune'. and even measly ol me can think of 8 insane mobs, where insane = &gt;250,000 hp<P>Will you make it so the boss is the same as the other mobs that defend him ? Weaker ? <BR>Do you have guidelines on what the maximum encounter is ? <BR>What do you consider the absolute peak mob ? Phara Dar ? Sky Mobs ? Velraktor ?<P>Or is all of this going to be discussed tommorow, because you didn't expect the uproar, and are currently diving into spin control with no facts available ?<P>There is two items in the game that are close to a clerics heart. You nerfed the res with the 'Oh, res sickness now is a Turgors' to try and protect your Mobflated creations, and now it looks like you have declared war on our sole unique class defining feature, the Complete heal. <P>Are these mobs *that* important to you that you are risking the entire structure of Everquest, as well as the enjoyment of the Cleric class ?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I too, beg to differ with Brad.<P>"Removal of the HP cap added more variety to the game -- it changed strategies and tactics. No longer were we forced to simply make mobs kill in a very short period of time. Overall, this is a very good thing for the game -- variety and encounters that require differing tactics is good."<P>Velious is almost 100%  hack , slash and heal.<P>INT means damn near nothing. Tanks die, get stick rezzed and with lil more they are up and running.<P>INT folk, on the other hand, assuming they can land anything in the first place, once dead are out of the picture.<P>On what basis do you say SoV has brought variety to the game?<P>The mana pool available to casters is plain too small. <P>Variety, you say. Im sorry but i fail to understand you, Brad.<P>If you really want to add some variety, make the mana pool larger. Create a spell that gives dead people instant mana afer the caster dies. Im sure u recall that the mana pool after death was removed from the game, because again, u stated it was overpowering to have a dead caster come back and nuke, nuke, nuke. If i recall,   that was a Naggy and Vox issue way back.<P>With the new mobs, do you really see the need for this?  <P>Its not like if the casters had a larger mana pool they are going to chain nuke. That would be a recipe for insta death. There has to be some kind of management of the casting or said caster will die before using his mana pool.<P>Give INT folk more mana at higher levels, faster med. Tune the higher level caster for Velious. <P>As it is, why even bother with casters?<P>Its literally impossible to get more than 50 or so people close together without risking tons of LDs, makes the choice obvious for the raid organizer. Tanks and healers.<P><BR>Noc<BR> <P>As it is, I repeat, there is no variety. Its pure hack and slash.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Gary Gygax was actually the inventor of the game 'Dungeons and Dragons'. It was taken from him by TSR during the 80's, though now he's on the project again since its been purchased by wizards of the coast.<P>you'll find that playing DND 3rd edition is a nice supplement to your time off everquest and a good reason to socialize IRL =)<P>I'm not sure if he did any work on the wizardry games, but its possible.  I _STILL_ enjoy those games, in fact I booted it up on a NES emulator the other day and had a crack at it.  Quite fun 5 hours spent there. (yes, I own the game, software piracy is bad... its the NES i dont have any more LOL)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>ADDITION:<P>All non clerics, wizards (lure), and pure melee classes are essentially useless in giant raids.<P>Why?  <P>1) the MR as well as other resists are INSANELY HIGH on these mobs.  Not only are they higher level than us (which makes them hard to cast on to begin with) but they have ULTRA HIGH resists on top of that. <P>2) The classes just arn't balanced.   There are 3 subsets of unbalnces in the game...<P>a) Clerics- No one comes close to healing like a cleric.  CH is the ultimate spell PERIOD.  Not only that but it is like Verant didn't even try to even up the healing between Clerics vs. Druids and Shaman.  Wow a 600 point 4.5 sec heal. (Oh wait its not even 600 hp...only clerics cast it for 600 hp).<P>b) The melee classes- No one comes close to out tanking a warrior.  No one comes close to outdamaging a rogue (except a warrior which makes Warriors needed that much more).  And then you have monks... which are high damage and high AC but start to fall behind these two classes.  Although they are still godly at pulling at all levels.<P>Behind these 3 classes there is a DRAMATIC drop.  The Hybrids are pathetic.  Spells are at best 1 or two level 44 or 49 spells form their parent class.  Most spells don't hit the Mobs you are casting on.  Especially, in the SKs case, the spells are balanced for a MUCH lower level Necromancer ie MUCH TOO LONG of cast times for their spells to be effective for what they do at the level in which they are using them.<P>I brought up spells first because it is supposedly the justification for not being able to melee as well as the other three pure melee classes. Not even all three classes COMBINED can do any one thing a warrior can do 1) absorb damage as well 2) stand in front of a mob as long 3) output as much damage as a war.  <P>3) Casters-  Well in general ALL casters are fairly useless in the upper end of the game.  The resists are so high that NOTHING lands.  The only exemption is Wizards and their Lures.  Even the Lures are kind of fruitless considering they are supposed to be the masters of damage per sec.  You want to compare a wiz casting a lure (cause it is the only thing that will land) vs a Rogue in dmg per sec?  I think you will be VERY surprised.  <P>So when casters ask to actually be able to hit a high lev mob Verant's response is that Wizards are the only ones with that ability and it makes them useful on raids.  My response is that even that ability is put to the test against a Rogue.  All the Caster classes need improvements to battle for 10-15mins against a mob.  They were only designed to fight against a mob with 32k hp in fights that lasted at TOPS 2-3mins.  They don't have the mana nor the spells to sustain a fight for 15 minutes.<P>So.....  basically all you have now is a bunch of pure melee and a TON of clerics to kill uber mobs.  If you are any other class, well you can loot anything with your name on it because we'd hate to see it rot but you are still a 2nd class citizen.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
