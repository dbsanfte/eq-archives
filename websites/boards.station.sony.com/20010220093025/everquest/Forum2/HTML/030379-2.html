</FONT><HR>Hey klinzhai, take a look at Bioware/Interplay and it's line of Infinity Engine games.  Baldur's Gate, then Tales of the Sword Coast less than a year later, then Planescape: Torment a few months later, followed by Icewind Dale, and finally Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn.  This is not including the upcoming Icewind Dale expansion Heart of Winter (might be wrong on that name) and the rumored BG2 expansion.<P>Sure, Icewind Dale is done by Interplay (Black Isle actually, but part of Interplay) and I think Torment is as well.  But the fact remains that it is possible to highly upgrade the game without a whole lot of overhead.<P>This brings up another question.  Bioware designed and developed the game Baldur's Gate.  They are the ones doing the fixes and upgrading to the game.  But Interplay produces the game and handles Customer Service and online activites (message boards).  But ultimately it is Bioware who does the work.  Is the same not true of Verant and Turbine?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Matter of fact, I started a new druid last week, just so I could go through it all again.<P><BR>I am excited about the new spells for druids in an RP sense.  Cant wait to have a pet.  Utility-wise, they don't really impress me, but then I can't see anywhere ( except in the pre-39 roots ) that druids were lacking anyway.<P><BR>Now what does suck is Verants attitude that the company owns the planet and we the players have to be content with whatever you feel like doing with the game.

</FONT><HR>Greetings Featherfoot,<P>Thought I would response to parts of your post.  I have not played a druid yet, so I can not comment on it's current list of spells or the spells rumored to be in the SoV uxpansion.  But I am currently trying out an Iksar Shaman an enjoying it quite a bit.  I have not even looked beyond my next circle of spells that I get at 14th level, mostly because I will probably not get past that circle of spells.  Why?  I hae the idea of forced grouping and the forced player economy.  But that is another topic.  I just wanted to say that with the classes I have played so far (warrior, shaman, monk, and a newly created rogue), I have not seen a single class that I do not like.  But then again, I have not looked past level 20.<P>On the part about Verant not listening to their customers, or taking their suggestions to heart..... Take a look at Bioware and Black Isle (Baldur's Gate and series).  I have never seen a company have such a repoire with their customers and still put out such wonderful games.  In fact, I wish they would do a MMORPG and I have even suggested it to their developers.<P>I can't comment on Verant's Customer Service, or lack thereof, as I have not had a reason to contact the Customer Service department.  I have a feeling that I will soon though.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Actually I would like to thank gordon and absor for posting, and most of all verant for making a game that has actually saved me money and brought enjoyment back into my gaming life. I've been playing eq for over a year now and not bought another single game the whole time. Other wise before i was spending 50 bucks amonth on some crap game i would play for a month at the most. As for eq, my main is lvl 48 and i'm thrilled at the new spells my class MIGHT get in the expansion. <P>As i have told every low level begger, the best illusion in everquest is power. Just because a necro can solo 1 to 60 doesn't mean he is any more powerful in the grand scheme of EQ than a warrior. For instance, how many necros or druids do you soloing in fear? Not blooming many. THe fact is you have to have one class to do somethings. Without melees, casters would be waiting cans of spam. With out casters, melees would be sitting hps. It takes the pluses and minuses of both to get far in the game. <P>These good and bad points are there for a reason other wise this game would be quake. Everyone would look different but do the EXACT same thing in the long run shoot kill shoot kill. Sure there are problems with the game. Name one game that is perfect. I like eq and the pure excitment that i get when I go on plane raids and such. But anyway, I tried to begin with thank you ALL at Verant. You have a helluva product.<P>Neo  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Abashi writes:<BR>"We will not take a successful product and keep tweaking its core definition in an attempt to please 100% of the people."<P>I actually agree with this statement in full today, and I would have agreed with it twelve months ago.  The problem is that VI has indeed done just that for the last year or more.<P>In short, if Verant weren't so quick to nerf, the impression that core class definition is constantly in flux simply would not exist.  It is indeed dificult to accept that VI has now reached any kind of true balance at this time, when they, through their own actions, have shed doubt on this time and time again.<P>Was the game balanced a year ago?<P>Six months ago?<P>A month ago?<P>It is dificult to accept any answer of 'yes' to those questions without asking why items and abilities have been taken away from the players in that same time frame.<P>In short, Verant made a huge mistake by constantly tinkering with classes over the last two years.  THEY invited the current state of complaint.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree with Snoota. Alot of the complaining has to do with comparisons to other classes and relative power.<P>&lt;&lt;If you choose not to like your new abilities, so be it, but you still have all of your old ones to work with as well.&gt;&gt;<P>&gt;&gt;It has to do with relative power. They may get these new toys, but if a class that they are compared to(Druids and Shamans, Paladins and Shadow Knights, Warriors and Monks, and so on) get bigger toys, they lose relative power. That's what the Monks have their panties in a knot about: They are much more powerful post 50 than they were pre 50 with the right equipment, but they've lost relative power to other melees  because other melees were upgraded more with better armor and weapons that reach Monk damage levels.<P>And I was just using Monks as an example, I think they still rock. ;P&lt;&lt;<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Where?<P>The thing that the gentleman is getting at, that I wish you would understand, Abashi, is that for some reason, Verant thinks that not telling the players anything is the right thing to do. And misleading, is also a good thing to do.<P>I think you are incorrect on both notions. Why does Verant have a problem with people parsing anything? So what? It doesn't change the game ... it only adds a little fun to our playing. What is so damaging about that?<P>It's the level of paranoia that is quite amusing. I find it incredible that the attitude that the programmers and Verant take towards their "secret" is so damn militaristic (Quake/Doom clone after all!), that they live in fear that if someone knows they do 15 damage instead of 17, or the formula to something or other, that it is going to change the game. <P>IT ISN'T.<P>But it is nice to know that I used the DDD on the Orcs in Highpass, and it looks like I did X amount of damage ... and maybe I can get the handfull of players that think I am a stubborn and stupid Bard that wants to use instruments instead of weapons!<P>This aint't the Cold War anymore, unless you are making it so!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alot of these changes were implemented because of HUGE player outcry to address a particular problem.  All these improvements if someone saying 'sucks' is because they werent implemented as strong as the players hoped, noone is calling for the removal of the spells unless it's a jealous person of another class!  Where are the players calling for deletion of these spells rather who arent just class envy posts, or just unhappy that Verant didnt make it as strong as they wished?  <P>Abashi-"It seems that unless something is obviously overpowering, that is the first response to nearly anything that we put in. We put in Evade for the rogues and got a "this sucks". We put in the lure series for Wizards and got a "this sucks". Both of these despite the fact that these are now well known to be good features. That's just TWO things that were put in, met immediately with "this sucks", which were later found to be very useful.  <P>Harvest for wizards. Reduced aggro for bards. Increased bash and taunt caps for hybrids. More harmtouch damage for shadowknights. Crits, crips, and nearly everything that's been put in for warriors taking them right to the brink of being overpowered. Haste increases for unarmed monks, though hailed for roughly six months now "suck". The screaming terror change from a "Fear+blur" to a mez.

</FONT><HR>Ok, can you tell me something then.<P>Please let me know what "enhancements" have been made to Shaman since release?<P>Most stat buffs do very little.<P>The pets SUCK, and the 50+ pet has a 20% chance of being 1 level higher than the sub 50 pet.<P>The Poison/disease buffs post 50 are less mana efficent than the sub 50 ones.<P>They get regen/chloro/regrowth before the druid class, however the druid is the only one that has a group version.<P>The group versions of Shaman stat buffs aren't as powerful as their single target ones. (unlike group heroism) You should make them as powerful, and just shorten the duration, it'd make playing a shaman much more enjoyable.<P>Shaman were the master debuffers, till Kunark, then magicians became their equal.<P>Shaman Epic weapon has a DOT not a buff. Shaman are BUFFERS, you should have given it Avatar or some other Ultimate buff spell. Either that or an ultimate Slow or Malosi spell. <P>It's not class envy, it's that this class is LACKING. I'd really like to see some direction given to this class, it used to be a good class. In the post 50 game tho, they seriously suck.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>George135 is worried about his emotional state being fooled with but what is he and lots of other posters doing to the people at Verant? Hmm.<P>In real life if you talked to someone in the way some of the posters here do anon, you might end up with yourself sitting on the ground. Not a threat just trying to point out that RESPECT is a two way street. You can not demand that everyone in the world think of your feelings with out thinking about theirs. Try and imagine that when you are posting something that you are writing to your mother.<P>Every Ranger I know is already complaining about our 4 additional spells and they have never used them. HOW CAN YOU COMPLAIN in advance of actual use? They complain about the new version of snare. I love it. it will open up a slot in the limited 8 spell slots. I will be able to cast snare without stoping my attack, because it is a proc. And each cast of the snare proc will not cost me any mana.<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've said this before and I'll say it again.<P>If Verant added a new weapon, the unholy booty kicking sword of superiority, made it damage 30 delay 15 +20 to all stats +200 hit points +50 to all resists, procs group Complete Heal, there would *STILL* be people here complaining that it sucked.<P>The same goes for spells.  If they gave shamans a 1 mana level 90 wolf pet, I bet some people would be here saying "But you just don't get it, pets are not the core of the shaman class."  Nothing Verant does can make some people happy.  There is no point in Verant trying to make those people happy.  I know many many shamans in game.  Not one of those Shamans is as disappointed with the class as the people who are complaining here are.  What does that say?  That says to me the Shamans here are experiencing Burnout, but rather than admit it they believe it's somehow the class's fault.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Abashi:<P>OK you have 300K+ paying customers right?  Even though people say things suck, it is relative, you should know that seeing those subscription numbers, so please cancel the pity party.<P>Still the majority of tweaks done to classes are a result of issues that come to light late in the game.  EQ at high levels isnt balanced at all.  It wasnt balanced 1-50, and 51-60 messed things up even more.  Hearing you guys constantly preach 'class balance' without even being able to give a consistent definition of what that might be, let alone being able to live up to it, is frustrating to your customers.<P>Want examples?  Hybrids (especially Rangers) 51+ are a waste.  They are inferior to their parent classes in terms of power and group contribution, AND they have an outrageous xp penalty on top of being inferior.  You guys refuse to see this, giving hybrids only minor tweaks, and refusing (under false pretenses, controlling the number of players playing a class, check the numbers, hybrids are the least played classes on the newest servers) to adjust the xp tables.<P>More examples?  Clerics and Chanters are required too often.  Period.  Play your game, and you'll see this.  Gaining xp in groups, and 'doing' dungeons is ENTIRELY reliant upon the presence of a cleric and chanter in FAR too many circumstances 51+.  You guys cant even admit this, much less begin to work on the resolution.<P>The necro epic item effect is another example of not listening.  Listen to the 59/60 Necros who play your game.  Collectively, they know more about the necro class than yourself, or anyone at Verant, I guarantee it.  90+% polled here say the current effect is USELESS.  And yet, you summarily dismiss them.  Why?  Pride?  Lazyness?  Contempt for the class?<P>The fact is, these boards bring many valid issues to light, it is just that the vast majority of them are written off as 'as designed' or 'working as intended' or flat out just said to be off the table issues, like xp penalties and melee binding.<P>Verant, as a company, needs to spend double or triple the amount of resources it currently does on testing or else make the process VASTLY more efficient.  Things in pre-Kunark EQ are still broken.  TONS of Kunark stuff is broken.  SoV is on the way, and you can bet your life there will be over powered drops, broken quests, bugged zones, bugged NPCs, things not dropping, etc.<P>Additionally, your customers are ALWAYS going to know more about your game than you, as a whole, we simply put more (1000s of times more probably) effort into EQ than you do.  So it would help if you'd listen and be a little more reactive.<P>Sayleth</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OK everyone!  Listen up!<P>This is JUST a game.  Classes are balanced per the Vision™ and that is it!  Enough of this crying about balance as you see it.<P>You play this game; you chose your class.  No one is telling you to do it; you are doing it on your own.  Stop complaining, stop whinning, stop comparing your class to others (there will always be those that are better and those that are worse off).<P>I admit I got all caught up in this "my class is not as powerfull as others" crap (afterall, Wizards are supposta be "uber" right?!).  But, you know what, I took time off and got a new attitude towards this GAME!  Yes, I agree that the Vision™ does not make sense in most cases, but you know what, I don't care anymore.  I spend time online with friends and that is THE ONLY THING that counts in this game.  <P>A friend of mine played a Ranger as his first character and a Necro as his second.  He admits that the two cannot be compared.  We just conclude that the "balanced" spectrum of the Vision™ is VERY wide, scratch our collective heads, and move on with playing.<P>The trick is to not get offended by "enhancements" to your class.  And above all, roll play!  Do you look at an Olympic athlete who just won the gold and demand that you be given the same skills so ytou can win your own?  NO!  Instead, you say "wow!" and continue with your life.<P>As for Abashi, I agree that the crying is annoying.  However, whether you realize it our not, Verant created the crying.  Think about it, you add post 50 levels and monsters but want to keep the players the same?  Wrong!  The problem is that the game was not planned well enough to forsee the need for post 50 levels and monsters so it was not designed to include this.  Your addition later was a "patch" at best and will never be seamless.<P>I think I speak for many when I say that fixing quest problems and general bugs is MUCH more important to the player base than class/race "balance" (unless it's for the PvP servers).<P>So, to summarize, EVERYONE (players and employees alike) !! QUIT WHINNING !! and play the game or move on!<P>Heh, now that I've pissed off half of the 300,000 players in the game, guess I'll never find a group now.<P>/em thinks his Steelskin will not hold up long from the onslaught.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Gordon is right!<P>I've been going after a few threads on the Spell bashing.  I remember reading a few articles on SOV that said that no new spells were coming out.  That only Gate spells were going to be available.  I looked at them yesterday, and went Ooooo...  Aaaaaa..   Cool, it's a bonus.<P>SOV was supposed to be a new Continent.  More story, area and challenges.  Of course new Items, armor, loot...  But the Spells, were the Cherry on top.<P>No one has played the game yet, and everyone is in arm about why the spell suck.  What a depressing bunch of crown that is.  Some spells might find uses that no one else thought about. Other spells might be critical in SOV, who knows.  NO ONE KNOWS... not yet.<P>Instead of telling Verant, Good Job. You came with a new continent.. I'm excited.. Can't wait.  Wow, new spells.  Thanks.    Well, people prefer moping complaining about what they don't get.  What a bunch of Self Centered crowd we have... and I'm talking about those going against Verant no mattter what they do.<P>You've got a company here trying to come out with something cool.  Abashi is working on the SOV Project, it's his baby right now (I believe it is...).  And he comes here... and keeps reading negative posts... on Ignorance no less.  Of course I'd be passionate about something that's under my care... and I'd be upset about the ridiculous outburst that has been coming out.<P>People have become so selfish in this time and age, and so self centered.  They are never happy with what they have, always miserable with what they don't have.  Just be happy, and have fun.  This is an ENTERTAINMENT GAME.  that's what it's meant for.  Not to develop Ulcers over what spell is good, and which one suck.  God darn useless b*tching.  Put you're energy in good use.  And look forward to what's coming... Say thank you when you get something, stop being so Grrr...  Damn, I've thought my kids well... why am I going through this again...   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Abashi...  I looked at the Demo.  Loved it.  I looked at the spells...  I'm excited.  Even though I only have an average of 45-60 min a day in the week... I have fun everytime (well, sometimes I get frustrated.. hehe).  Good job guys.  And continue the good work, don't let the pessemistic put you down...  They Dont deserve EQ.  They'll got for another game, and then figure out that the software Industry is mostly the same...  Support is the same...  and that this new area you started with EQ...  will have stumbling blocks in all places too.  You guys are first in this field, and I'm looking forward in where you're going...  If EQ2 is a reality, and things continue getting better...   I just can't wait...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR> The Hybrid and non-specialist issue:<P> You will lack specialization if you chose a class that has a broader base of power to chose from. Casting tanks and druids will not be as proficient as a specialist class that is limited in what it can do but does what it can do very well.<P> Doesn't mean there cannot be gripes with certain hybrid issues but that's the underlying philosophy and I support it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First of all... Robert135, that's terrible (the accident you witnessed).  I'm sorry.<P>But, um, that's related to the SoV release *how*?  I mean, unless you go to San Diego with an AK-47 and mow down the entire Verant CSR department, testimony as to your emotional state at the time of the SoV release is less than relevant.<P>Someone mentioned cars... but another great example of "false information" is the entertainment industry.  Big movies that people hunt for info on always have "fake" titles that they film under, to avoid the crowds following the "Star Wars: Episode II" signs.  =)  The best example is probably the script they gave to David Prowse, the body of Darth Vader, for The Empire Strikes Back... It didn't say "Luke, I am your father."  It said, "Luke... Obi-wan is your father."  Why?  Because he was a bigmouth, and they wanted to keep it secret.<P>As to people who feel they know what the new spells will be dissing them already... Here's a funny story from before I started playing, when my boyfriend had just gotten his mage to about level 6.  He'd gotten a new spell called Gate, and experimented with it.  He determined that it took him back to his bind point.  He told me "Yeah, but it's not that useful... it costs 70 mana, and it's not like I can't just run there in about the time it takes to cast."  Hehe.  The moral of the story is, you don't know how a spell will be used until you've had some experience with it.<P>And, Gordon, thanks for finally telling it like it is... I hope you didn't get in trouble for that post =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I read the review and comments from Verants developers and I want to throw in my 2 cents. This game is 1,000 times better than when I started playing (initial release). I play an enchanter currently, and I have to say that my class does not suck. Although, prior to the freezing of skills and caps etc, I wouold like to say that I would appreciate more role-playing features for enchanters. I don't want to just mess with the minds of the MOBS, but to confuse and dazzle players (in a non-PVP world). And I miss enchantment of light. That would have been lots of fun (glowing leather armor would have been entertaining, though impossible to program.)<P>Also, I could be made happier if Verant is extremely careful when balancing all classes. I have no direct complaints, but some limitations are kind of strange (ie I've heard of rangers that cannot ensnare opponents and shoot arrows while they are stuck. But I never play a ranger, so I don't care.) <P>Anyway, thats just my 3 cents.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Gordon I understand the need to freeze certain aspects of game development, particularly class balance. However I hope you take the issues regarding hybrid balance vs pure class (primarily pure melee) balance very seriously and remedy the balance issue that was introduced with Kunark. If you don't you definately will alienate a sizable portion of your player base.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Abashi stated, "Haste increases for unarmed monks, though hailed for roughly six months now 'suck'."<P>I was there when it happened, and man was I stoked.<P>This was before Kunark, though.  Kunark changed a lot of rules.  Monk fists, by Abashi's own admission, are now considered the default "worst case" at higher levels.  The addition of monk 1HB weapons such as Fighting Batons allow pretty much anyone to twink a monk and have damage dealing ability superior to fist damage throughout their career.<P>When compared to new weapons such as the Tranquil Staff, monk fists are no longer the ideal weapon they once were.  This seems to be the focus of the monk whines, not that the fist delay reduction (haste implies that it works similarly to item or spell haste, and is therefore misleading).<P>The main focus of monk discontent seems to be *not* that our fists are weak (which, unfortunately, they are when compared to top eschelon Kunark weapons), but that other classes can eliminate the need for monks by obtaining damage-dealing ability that is close enough that the monk class limitations (low AC, HP at 60th level) make monks undesirable in groups.<P>Abashi's response to that particular issue was something I was pretty happy to see.  According to tests VI conducted, monks outdamaged warriors by about 1/4.  Unfortunately, though, the test data contradicts similar testing done by players, which shows a much tighter margin -- roughly 1/10, in fact.<P>Anyway, Abashi and Absor, you guys have to deal with lots of negativity from customers about a bunch of different topics.  The problem is, whenever the balance of the game is changed, someone is screwed out of some territory.  When players feel that their place in the game is threatened, they whine.  Something 'fixed' months ago may well become broken again (from a balance perspective) when new content is added.  Please try not to get frustrated when your players tell you something "sucks," though.  They might be right.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have to agree that if VI wants to keep the information on actual spell effects secret, they certainly have the right to.  As the client does need to know what the spells are expected to do, its not unreasonable for a file containing the spell effects to be on your PC.  As this is the case, VI is by proxy legitamatly protecting is IP by adding or obfuscating data to / in the file.<P>That said, personally I think most forms of IP protection are Bunk... there is no harm in letting people see that data until such a point as someone starts to make money off of the IP =)<P>So how about it Verant, instead of maintaining the deep dark mystical "we're always right" corporate culture how about opening up the creative process to the end-users. =)  Instead of having everyone out there digging for scraps of info on the new spell / disciplines, etc from Velious, why don't you come out and POST the info.  Perhaps not in the same detail as what you might get out of the spell parsor, but why not give us a general overview of what each spell does and let the community discuss it.  We will of course bear in mind that you have final say, but just allowing us to discuss the info, and perhaps have a hand in our destinies gamewise will go along way to eliminating the negative connotations surrounding the words Verant and Customer Service.  <P>Please give us this oportunity.  I understand the Bread and Circuses philosophy, however rational (and some irrational) discussion will always have a positive affect on design. If only to bring another point of view to that design.  We are all deeply interested in the path that this game takes. I for one would be greatful for the opportunity to influence that path before it is thrust upon me.<P>All spelling mistakes are my own, and not those of my employer or the public school I attended<P>Perk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

ROTFLMAO.<P>You just can't hack, you ARE a hack. Sheesh, If I was Verant and people were hacking my files to try and break the rules, I would do pretty much the same, and if you were caught out I would regard it as a highly successful exercise.<P>I think Gordons responses are on the money, your comments are worthless<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
