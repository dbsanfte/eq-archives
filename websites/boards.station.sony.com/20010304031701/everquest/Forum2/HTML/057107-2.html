</FONT><HR>Ok to me this Ebay issue is rediculous.  I myself would never buy virtual things for real money or sell virtual things for real money but that is just me.  Now to me it is actualy better for Verant and Sony to allow these auctions on Ebay and whatnot because said auction sites are protected by contractual agreements.  With such auctions made illegal by Verant people are going to go through other channels to get these items and characters and cash.  This also leads to much fraud and stealing.  This is what the very big downside to Verant banning these auctions is.  Now people are going to go around the system instead of through a system.  I could easily see someone filling a lawsuit against Verant because they sent real cash to someone for a account of item and receiving nothing in return.  Pain and anguish or something.  Course just speaking my mind on something like this violates the EULA probably.  <BR>Hail Verant! *best nazi impression I can muster*<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Verant.. just a note. <P>You guys can say were violationing whatever agreements all you want. Sales WILL continue..if not on Ebay it will be somewhere else. If i want to get a high lvl account or "Cool_Rare_item00" I can do it as long as the internet is out there. <P>FYI there are pending class action lawsuits underway against ebay and verant and the way this was handled.<P>For all the time and money invested into EQ to gain really nothing(infact loose) Real Life profit(mental\physicall\financial). Thats just silly.. selling accounts should be encouraged what would you expect some lvl 60 character that is going off to war or something and cannot have the time to play EQ to just delete their account when profit pontential is soo high? Your dreaming.<P>Yes players do have rights on selling their Time.. something VI has no controll over. If someone wants to give away their account for free with some under the table deal you guys wont legally be able to stop it.<P>Im just tired right now but these are my 2cp as of this moment. <P>/Cheer Ebay sales<BR>What an awsome way for teenagers or even adults to make a living.<P>(ya i havnt done any sales on ebay, but i have lots of friends that do it frequently...)<P>"May your wallet be thick and your Lewt be Phat"<P>-Daeksun Quillmane-<BR>Vicar of The Rathe<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1st off let me say, I am not a buyer or seller of EQ gear on the internet, so just leave me alone Variant  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>But, I must say this.  I have played the game since Beta and I have gotten about 20+ of my closest friends addicted to the game as well.  A few did buy and sell gear.  We would look at the auctions on ebay and be amazed at the prices some gear fetched and say to each other "Man, I just got that last night in a Raid!! Very Cool!  <P>But now we all feel a bit different in the game, all of us.  We have just been told over and over that the gear we have quested, hunted and camped....is not ours.  Again, I do not buy or sell, but it was a nice feeling to know that at least my 10 hrs in that chair was worth something.  But that feeling is gone now, for all of us really  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>I doubt if I will ever stop EQ.  I am a VETERAN  45 Paladin on Mith Marr and known by many, I cannot leave (too much armor to make...).  But to have "permission" to sell my account if I ever did have to stop the game, would have been a nice and a great feeling to the time I put in.<P>So, I guess when I am done, I am done.  the big DELETE button  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">(<P>Phracas<BR>44 Paladin<BR>Mith Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I thoroughly agree with Verant's move to stop e- bay auctions. My reasoning is simple in almost every game or sport amateurs and pros dont compete for the simple reason one does it for fun the other for cash.<P>I have grouped with people who were selling accounts - they were great players but it was not fun - the spirit of play was lost.<P>What concerns me is that Verant might lose abashi's reply shows he is no lawyer and his remark about ducks is more applicable to the EULA than to anything else - The Eula looks dangerously easy to represent as a restraint of Trade.<P>I think Abashi should post clearly why Verant opposes characater sales and poll us - at the very least this will establish that Verants actions are not the arbitrary excercise of power but rather responding to the wishes of players.<P>Unfortunately such a poll would have little bearing on the legal issues but it might allow Verant (should they lose) to run servers for amateurs and others for pros.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Why ebaying is bad.<P>1. Sony does not want to be invovled with any deals that go sour.  <BR>A. PlayerA buys Item X on ebay and it is never delivered.  PlayerA quits game.  <BR>Bad for VI, lost a customer due to fraud.  <BR>VI does have a vested interest in their customer base.<P>B.   PlayerB decides to quit the game, sells his account to PlayerA.  One week later he changes his mind.  Gets Sony to change the password back, through either contacting sony or the auto password changer at the station ( if PlayerA hasn’t changed the email adddress).  PlayerA then provides proof that he bought the account.   Account gets banned.   Just a BIG pain in the but for VI to have to deal with this type of crap.  Bad for VI.<P>2. PlayerC wants an FBSS, Fruity boots, etc etc etc.  Decides to camp them.  PlayerB (the ebayer) and friends have 2 groups camped for them.  Really bites to have to wait in line. along with the other 2 groups ebaying them, and the 2 MORE groups that just want to earn them honestly.  Eliminate the ebaying campers, then you will be down to just the few that want to earn them honestly.  PlayerC quits the game in frustration  because Ebayers are taking ALL the good camps.  Bad for VI.<P>3.    PlayerC goes on a high level raid with GuildB, hoping to get a shot at a good classY (lets say Pally) drop.   PlayerB ( not a pally) ends up with the item because he is in GuildB and can ebay it.   Some of the uber guilds promote farming and ebaying within their ranks (theory anyway).  PlayerC quits the game due to frustration. Bad for VI.<P><BR>4  PlayerD has saved plat and hopes to buy ItemX ( boncaster or whatever) in EC.  Because playerB farms more than half of the drops and sells them on ebay.  PlayerD will never see one sold in EC.  PlayerD does not have the 6 or 8 or 30 hours to camp itemX in any given stretch so he has to hope to buy it in game.  So PlayerD quits EQ out of frustration.  Bad for VI.<P>5.  It is unfair to players, to not have a chance to get various items.  SO MUCH IN THIS GAME IS SO HARD TO GET ,  never mind making those odds impossible.<P>6. The fact that good gear is sold on ebay, making the nearly impossible task of getting it in game completely impossible makes for a bad public image for sony.  Potential Players G, H , I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, AND Q, never even start to play the game because they know it will only end in frustration or the requirement that they WILL have to buy Item X on ebay if they ever are going to get it.  Bad for VI.<P>7.   Part of the game is pride in your items,  PlayerE, was really proud of eanring ItemZ, putting in the hard camp, the hours, etc.  but was frustrated when he discovered that Players S, T, U, V and W all had the same item,  All were newbies, All had bought the item on ebay.   PlayerE, disappointed that he lost the pride in his item as too many people had it., that didn’t deserve it.  quits the game.  Bad for VI.<P>7. I’m sure im missing a few things here.<P>8.  Insert the majority of the customer base where ever it says Bad for VI,  <BR>Farming for items is bad,  selling them on ebay is worse. <BR>Nothing like this uncontrolled abuse of the game to MAKE IT LESS DESIRABLE TO PLAY.<BR>The games desireablilty is a BIG THING.  Contribute to the game being unplayable or undesirable and verant has a good legal argument to protect their interests.<P>9.  Player A buys Player B’s account,   Player A takes that level 54 character on a high level event.  Since player A knows jack about playing that class, he gets the whole party killed.  Players get pissed,  players quit.  Bad for verant.<P>Ebaying and Farming is just poor business in a virtual world and affects the potential for VI’s profits in the real world.  VI made a great game.  They have the legal right to protect their interests.  Which is keeping the game playable, and desireable.  <P>my 2cp<P>oh yeah  VI has to pay 3, 6 , 12 40? more customers service reps to deal with the fraud that takes place.  if this payroll allocation could go to pay more designers or GM's it would be better for us all.  Or the crs' could help you get your game running , or answer your petitions in less than 3 hours.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>As long as there are buyers, there will be sellers.  This is the golden rule of the marketing.  Lots players in game cannot get the stuff they want without join large guild, or have large number of friends.  What do they do? They go buy the stuff with real money outside game.  In UO, when a new/vet player want to be a mage but don't have the money for all the reagents needed.  They go out buy 1 million gold and become the gm mages that they wanted.  Not every player created equal in game, so players do what ever they to lvl the play field.  As long as they are happy, why should we call them losers?  <P>If you take look on the EBay and many other IRC selling sections.  Very few people are buying accounts, they only want pp and items.  So, those accounts are lost for good for the company.  Right now, EQ is at its peak.  However, 8 months from today, it wouldn't be the case anymore.  Take hard look at UO, one of the major reason for that game still have over 170k+ players in it is because OSI allows players to sell accounts and items.  As long as the characters/items/accounts got value, it would be hard for people to just give up right away and never look back. This is the fact isn't it?  If those saved games from our single player game worth some money, will you just remove the whole thing after you stop playing it?  If the BG1 characters cannot be imported into BG2, will you still keep them?  What Verant should do is increase the spawn rate of those popular spawn spots, randem the item drops, increase the size of the group to 8 people instead of 6.  Make all those deep dungeon mobs start to drop good loots.  Only these steps can solve the camping problem, and the fact that so few people want to go through entire dungeon from top to buttom.  Tell players don't own anything they have been working on will only distance players from the game.  Unless Verant want to make people quit EQ to player their new Star War game, then they are doing something very...you put in the word.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Actually, it's good this is happening.  When the new MMORPGs come out that will allow auctioning of in-game items and accounts on Ebay for real money, hopefully all the farmers and people who play games "for a living" will move on to THOSE MMORPGs since it will be so much easier to do what they do.<P>I seriously doubt the population of EQ will even notice them leaving.  I also seriously doubt any but a very FEW will LEAVE EQ simply because they cannot buy items or prefab characters on Ebay.<P>As far as EQ auctions going underground ... do you really think your average Joe Schmoe who doesn't have the time to camp a MoB for an item, DOES have the time to track down backwoods, prohibited websites?  The ONLY reason those guys were buying stuff of Ebay and Yahoo before is because it was easy, fast, and safe.<P>Take away those three qualities, and you probably kill off 90% of the sales of accounts and items.<P>I find it interesting that EverQuest is actually doing this, because it really does make it seem that they are more interested in the "purity" of gaming than in crass commercialization and "anything goes".  <P>I don't have anything against auctioners, or people that want to make a living by playing a MMORPG, but let's face it.  ALLOWING it dramatically affects the game, and creates all sorts of problematical effects.  It DOES seriously affect the gaming experience of those who just play for fun.  <P>MY analogy:  Verant owns the putt-putt course.  I pay $10 to play all I want.  However, when I get there, there is another group of players that has set up a business at the windmill and other fun holes ... if I want to play those holes, I have to pony up some extra money to THEM.<P>This is exactly what farming for RL auctions/money does to the game.  It creates an atmosphere where, if you and your guild can CONTROL the entry of an item into the game by setting up a 24/7 camp, you are effectively blocking the windmill hole and demanding a kickback to golf on that hole.<P>It'll be interesting to see how all this plays out.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Thats all  great texture now when you get done with Ebayers you can start on the drug trafficing problems next. After that maybe you can get a life. Sad to see a small hand full of people getting off trying to hurt others that really dont affect the game on bit. VI may say its against their rules and that is their right to do that. But in the end two things will happen. Shadowbane, Camelot, and etc will come out and they have all pledged to either support or not care about Ebayers and what they do. I hate to tell you guys this but EQ will most likely lose 50 to 70% of their players to this game. But hey this small group of 3 or 4 people that dont like it can always stay. Just make sure you all get on the same server so you can group. I don't ebay myself for games because I think its silly to spend real life money on these items. But hey I dont believe in telling others what they can and cant do. As some people, ie Texture, think otherwise. I especially dislike the fact you cant sell accounts. Why, because I wanted to change servers to join some RL people I knew on a different one. I was not going to start over from a newbie acct with no items. EQ just isnt fun from 1 to 30 IMO. Sure it was 2 years ago but not anymore for me. VI really dropped the ball on not allowing server changes even if it was just once per account. They should allow and support Acct sells or trades. And to those who would say that oh the person doesnt know how to play that class. I say 2 things 1- Who Cares and 2- I have seen characters that arent ebayed and still have no clue how to play at 50 plus.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I want to play a game and you want to exploit the game to make money.  I'm being mean to you and your ebay buddies.  Awwww.

</FONT><HR>It is just a matter of time before a new avenue of trading is created for the sole purpose of trading everquest items.  As a matter of fact i know of one such type of software in development that would likely be very near impossible to remove any items whatsoever from auctions.  It truly amazes me how verant is handling this.  No i am not an ebayer And no i dont like when someone i know sells there account and that person takes on a new identity. But hey its not my place to try and stop someone from making money.  IF VERANT were smart they would provide the players with an avenue of trade and they could make sure transactions took place :-) plus look at the extra money you could make verant cause god knows thats the only problem they really have with it is there is money being made not going into their pockets.<P>anyway just my 2cents worth</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I just wanted to say that I am glad that sales of everquest items are being stopped. I have actually been able to get in groups with people my level in many areas typically over run by much higher level chars.  I dont like higher level chars taking over lower level good loot spawn just to make real money.<P>Doldi<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057107-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057107.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057107-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057107-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057107&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057107&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
