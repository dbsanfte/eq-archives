</FONT><HR>CharredToast:<P>"Is it hard because we do less damage than almost all other classes?"<BR>Nope, not true.  2 groups on a 2 group raid.  Identical groups, but a mage in 1 and me in the other.  I back off nuking or we get the kills.<P>"Is it hard because we are agroed on if we cast early in a fight, or chain cast?"<BR>Yep.  Learn not to, or learn to deal with it (root, snare, keep up sow, fight in the open, get over the mob hitting you, deal with being dead, etc.)<P>"Is it hard because we need a well rounded group (warrior, enchanter, and cleric) to even think of using our AOE spells?"<BR>I almost never use them, they are mostly a waste of space.  Grim thinks that is bad of me to say, as he feels it is wrong.  *shrug*  I seem to have more fun.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>"Is it hard because many of our ports will kill us, and our group?"<BR>Nope, not true.  Use your ports with your eyes open, take the risk, or control it, or don't.  "many" erm.  hehe.  Eh?<P>"Is it hard because if we are able to rapidly cast with the help of a good enchanter we are quickly OOM and need to set our for the next five or six pulls?"<BR>Nope, not true.  If you overburn you will go oom.  Don't do it unless things are desperate.<P>"Is it hard because many green mobs can kill us without difficulty (more so than any other class I have played)?"<BR>Nope, not true.  Snare.  Root.  Run.  SoW potions.  Yes before snare you need a group much more.  And your point?<P>"Is it hard because there are levels when we are out DD by other classes?"<BR>Nope, that is life.<P>"Is it hard because we have very few group friendly spells, and none that are unique?"<BR>Nope, the spell list is available when you start your wizard.  Learn it early.  We nuke.  And nuke.  And then we nuke.  We also gate, snare, root, stun, debuff (staff), evac.<P>"Is it hard because we are the class most effected by resists?"  ROFL - NO.  Play a chanter, get a resist on mez and tell me about it. Play a bard and get any of several resists.  ROFL man, just NO!<P>It is hard because we must *THINK* about how to control the aggro, the fight, our mana pool.  Learn what MOBs will pull off when hit with what spells.  Learn what MOBs will resist what spells.  It is hard because, like every other single class, there is balance.  We have strengths, shared by other classes.  We have weaknesses, shared by other classes.  I love my wizard, please leave him alone.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Mordenkanen:<P>We are often unwelcome in groups because:<BR> - the class is hard to play.  Many are *TERRIBLE* at it.<BR> - the class is so run down by its members: "mages do more damage" well then why the hell would you want a wizard if there is a mage available.  ROFL.  A mage has a built-in, disposable tank.  "wizards are BROKEN" - well then why would you EVER group with one?<P>I have not forgotten getting to 52.  I remember standing outside crushbone for the first time.  I remember gating into cazic (invis) the first time.  I remember the first time I zoned into NK, and there was a griffawn there.  SPLAT.  I remember the first time I waxed an evil eye with my druid partner...and how amazed he was at the damage I could do, so fast.  I remember gating into Skyfire the first time (the day I found Karnors...WAY before I was high enough to fight there).<P>I dunno, maybe the problem is that I "grew up" fighting with a druid continuously.  I started off ahead in damage and gradually pulled further and further ahead.  Now, at 51 he has a respectable pair of nukes...but they get resisted a lot, compared to wizzie...and they cost more mana for the damage.  Balance though: he is very group friendly...and on big raids, the one that is wanted is the wizard.<P>So, I have a wizard 52, and a Druid 51...and one of everthing else but bard and monk.  Gradually my other chars will catch up, or come close.  The post 50 game does not hold that much interest for me, yet.<P>Best of luck.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Stow.  Wow.  Play a tank man, they rock, right?  Since the game is balanced so heavily in their favor?<P>I have fought in Seb a lot.  I cast IC or Draught.  I live.  Consistently.  Why?  Not sure.  Maybe because I:<BR> - Stand back.<BR> - Make sure the mob is REALLY mad at the tanks.<BR> - Make sure the critters are snared.<BR> - Make sure the nuke will stick.<BR> - Choose a nuke that fits the critter.  Some things will leave the tanks and come for me if I even look at them.  Those I stun.  By the time the stun wears off it *REALLY* hates the tanks.<BR> - Root it if I think it may come for me...if I care.  It is going to break, yes, so?  It will hate the tanks by then, probably.<P>Hard to play.  Balance.  If you want to take the hits, play a warrior.  If you want to deal out damage and still take *some* hits, play a ranger, a rogue or a monk, depending on your style.  If you want to cast, but want to take the hits, play a paly or an SK.  But you won't find this magical class that the game is "balanced in favor of".  Each has strengths and weaknesses.<P>And your numbers are detached from reality, too.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> 15,000 Velious sales?  AHAHAHAHAHH!

</FONT><HR>Tirael<BR>Yes, wizards have been running the class down so long it is *VERY* hard to get pickup groups a lot of the time.  They just won't let up.  Whine, whine, whine, whine, whine.  Yech.  Interestingly, I hear other classes (even warriors) saying the same thing.  Perhaps the problem is that people don't like pickup groups?  I know I don't.  I tend to group with friends.  If I can't I twink or log 80% of the time.<P>Mage and Dru are nice.  I have both.  Wizard is higher.

</FONT><HR>Tarnak - "Sinneed, i don't see many valid reason in your reply to Grimstaff, things like &lt;me i use the Cazic Gate&gt; don't tell the real problem like its deathtrap to use it at level 24."<P>Follow these steps:<BR> - Go to Feerott.<BR> - Kill lots of lizards.<BR> - Go inside and /conn the lizards there.<BR> - Repeat a long time.<BR> - Go inside Cazic and /conn the lizards there, find that you are dubious.  Cheer.  Get level 10 and start working toward getting high enough to cast ports.<P>I do hear that it takes a REALLY large number of lizards, and you have to check the factions, you want to kill lizards that give you good faction in CT.  As I said, I decided I did not care.  I also hunted a lot there, so my faction may be irreparable now.<P>If you dont like that, follow these steps:<BR> - have sow<BR> - know the maze (maps are available, good ones)<BR> - group up with an inviscaster<BR> - caster starts casting invis on you<BR> - cast CT gate<BR> - invis hits you, you vanish<BR> - gate takes you<BR> - you arrive in the maze<BR> - RUN REAL FAST and don't get lost, invis is GOING to drop on you.<BR> <BR>Sorry you did not like the post.  Reread it perhaps?  You either did not or misunderstood, as you misstate my points.<P>CT gate is useful.

</FONT><HR>Avoid walking from NK? Well, what all this has to do with balance (the topic of this thread)? Only balance related attribute to this cute chat here is that druid ports are safe, wizard ports not, with the exception of Velious where druids get to share with us.<P>What I would like to see is a response from Verant stating where they are standing in relation to issues stated in Grimstaff's and Stow's posts:<BR>a) Do you think there is a balance related problems with wizard class?<BR>b) If yes, will there be any changes that address such problems?<BR>c) Was any of the feedback on this thread useful?<BR>d) Are you planning to separately patch issues that are not balance related, but still considered 'broken'?<P>I am trying not to sound nit picky here. Not all the wizards are cheeky bastards and most of us are under impression most of the presented issues here are real. Wizard player base feels frustrated and poked in both eyes for a reason.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sinneed.<P>Are you sure you have enough experience with wizards? 95% of your posts have been strictly in error and claiming wizard are a hard class to play and pointing at all the balance issues we have while claiming they dont exist. Wizard are a very simple class to play when you look at the concept of our class. Its only hard when the tools we are given is not effective enough to even perform well in our primary area of concept.<P>Grimstaff and strows posts are correct. Yours are not. I challange you to meet me on Solusek Ro and i will educate you in how to play a wizard and then if you do learn you should play a wizard untwinked from 1 to 60 and come on some high end guild hunts. After that lesson in psycological torture and suffering where you will feel worth less than the **** on your boots and you make less of a differance than the local clerics hammer pet, you can come here and post and we shall see if you have grown wiser by your new scars.<P>Many wizards are being turned to Alt characters now while we play our warriors rogues or monks. Our wizards are only brought fourth when we need to gate or when we need to take down a Veeshans Peak dragon.<P>Wizard is the only class that has so few abilities that are so weak and unsignificant compared to all other classes that wizards would never be missed if the class got deleted, and the game would be able to go on as if nothing happened. Just transfer the 2 plane gates to druids, the masters of teleportation (as of absors words), and there you are.<P>I predict that nothing will be done to fix this already HUGE balancing problem that have gotten out of hand as nicely put fourth by strow, as it is already too late to do anythign as the changes would have to be significant. So most if not all wizards will be turned to second class gate mules that all former players brings fourth once they need to taxi while we all start a tank.<P>This is a Melee game now. All damage oriented casters are loosing on this exept the healer classes. And of all caster classes wizards are the most pure specialist magical damage caster of all as we have no ability to do passive damage in the forms of pets or damageshields nor any group versitility. Casters being the worst class group in the game and wizards being the least effective of the casters... that means that wizards are the most useless class in the game bar none. And the gap is widening. <P>We all love our wizards and we will say that we like our wizards. Yes any char we have put 2 years of our life into is fun at times as we dont want to give them up even if we are forced to sit for 4 hours a day shouting for a group in zones then log but when it takes 2 weeks of twinking a warrior to be usefull to my guild again at high levels and shelfing my wizard as a gate mule then i can hardly be happy about the games so called balance anymore.<P>So sinneed... i understand where you are comming from, but the whole consept have failed before the release of the first expansion and gradualy gotten worse. now the gap in the dam is too wide to fix with the bones and bandaids they will throw at us.<P>As this is the last stabb they make at balancing the classes this is the last chance for many people to try save their 2 year of time invested in their wizards. I am one of them.<P>Sorasil Lorewind<BR>60th Level Sorcerer<BR>Paradigm<BR>Solusek Ro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sineed,<BR>it is nice to read your happy and unconcerned posts. Brave indeed to stand up against the general whining if you feel it has no substance. I appreciate that and I am glad to hear there is a wizard out there to whom his class is in balance with the other classes.<P>Unfortunaltely, I cannot agree. I see there is a lot of valid causes for criticism and not just wining. I have partnered with a druid myself for many levels and since neither buffs nor heals are needed for kiting, my wizard was superior from lvl 44 on. But mind you, this was because I was doing what I am specialized at while the druid could only use a fraction of his abilities.<BR>In a 'normal' exp group chain-killing blues, I act as you describe it: Nuke carefully, stun some, snare if needed. (I don't root a mob the tanks are attacking. Root increases my rank on the aggro list, takes my mana, doesn't do any damage and is likely to break when the mob is pounded on.) I don't overburn, so I stay at at least 40% to 50% mana for biger pulls/emergencies.<BR>The very simple problem is: My occasional nuke on the easy pulls doesn't help the party much. What I can contribute to a party's kill is just not worth my share of experience.<BR>In a real emergency, I still need to hold back until the mob hates the tanks enough (because no one will have time to get a mob off me when the tanks are in heavy melee and the caster is under attack). Wizards can seldom be the savior against large pulls. The rule is: If the enchanter can keep the mobs under control, the group is fine (and I am back to my occasional nuke, since there are now 4+ mobs to kill non-stop). If the enchanter fails, the fight is lost and the wizard runs for the zone with his group, at 80% mana and 50% health.<P>Let's not flame Sineed to ashes, I really like different opinions. But keep in mind this is in no way representing the view of almost all wizards about their class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I played my wizard for 59 levels and I have during most of that time believed that the class is broken. I chose a wizard because I wanted to do damage, but when every fugging damage dealing class is doing more damage than me something is seriously wrong. There have been times when I've felt it was worth it, but overall I really wish I had chosen another class when I started to play EQ.<P>Lately I've felt really frustrated because it seems to be a common belief by players that wizards are fairly balanced. It's like we should shut up and be happy we got our lures. I actually think that lures were one of the worst thing that happened to EQ. It cut our potential damage output almost by half and gave Verant a reason to have über mobs with insane resists. But hey, we should be happy because we can touch them right? It's not like we're necros or anything…<P>I've seen Verant's creation of the Vision over the last year. It's about making a game where you have to be a melee to be useful. There is no powerful magic in EQ, only a giant slugfest where the only things that matter are your hit points, AC and dam/del on your weapon.  <P>Remember about a year when someone analysed the dmg output of wizards and compared it to other classes? There were a lot of responses about it and finally Abashi responded and said he'd look into it and get back to us a few days later. Everyone waited for days and when he finally gave an answer he said that they felt that the class was balanced and if we didn’t like it we should play another one…I think that pretty much sums up Verant’s view of wizards. And when you consider that the same person were involved in creating Velious it’s no surprise things are looking as they do right now.<P>Anyways, even though I have a 51 monk I have cancelled my account. When you’re starting to get frustrated with a game and the creators of it it’s time to quit. They obviously don’t have the same view on things as I have. IMO they have taken a great game and turned it into a PoS game. Too bad SB beta hasn’t started yet.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sineed, you're saying "Group up" a lot. Do you PLAY a wizard? I'm confused. At low levels we offer nothing to a group, how pray tell are we to group? Come to think of it at all levels we offer nothing to a group. That is unless they can't find a druid.<P>Levels 1-7 were hell for me a wizard. Past 12 I was alright. 8-12 weren't bad either, 7 was a nightmare, even low blues were routinely kicking my ass. Group up. HA!<P>Cazic gate and port are bad and need to be changed, look at the druid one, they drop amoungst those scary spiders (level 3 at most) we drop in the midst of level 25 critters. Erm, even as a group that's a bad idea until you're 30. I never even bought Cazic gate, probably will eventually but it's a deathtrap before 35 or so.<P>Grimstaff has hit the nail on the head with near every point in his post.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Velious, wizards are not needed at all (it says something about the velious mob hps that a growth group with 3 wiz's chanter, cleric couldnt get one kill)and are essentially useless.

</FONT><HR>Doh. Absor, I hope your still reading this because I have something to say. If your out there still, post saying you are...Im almost not posting because it may be in vain.<P>What wizards want is very simple. Its going to sound...well, bad, but its what we want. We want to be the best weapons in the game. We want to deal quick, fast damage, and to be known as "Wizards...the guys who do all the damage". Unbalancing? Not when you throw in the fact we're willing to give up anything (more hps, more ac, pets, useful side spells, ANYTHING) to accomplish that goal.<P>In pre-Velious pre-Kunark Everquest, we did pretty much that. Sure, Necro's out-dot'd us, but no big deal. More damage is not necessarily better damage. And armed with Ice Comet, we were kings of DD.<P>After Kunark, we were even happier. Lures stirred the entire wizarding class to soaring new heights, and draughts were, in essence, the wizards of our spells. Fast damage. I for one had 0 complaints about the wizard class, besides the bugs (evac not clearing agro, etc).<P>Velious came out, and suddenly, wizards were suddenly down in the shady area.<P>I know why this is.<P>Kunark was good. You gave the tanks new weapons, and thus new lengths of damage dealt, in the form of weapons such as the Wurmslayer, Green Jaded Broadsword, and a million others. You gave wizards new weapons in spells. There was harmony.<P>In Velious, you gave tanks new weapons. Uber weapons. Weapons we would have not thought possible pre-Kunark. And they were happy, because they were dealing so much more damage.<P>Wizards, on the other hand, got no new weapons. They received an ice based Sunstrike. Thats like giving tanks a two handed wurmslayer. I dont know how you didnt see that when you made it. No wonder wizards are complaining about Velious mobs.<P>Come on you guys, wake up a bit. Next expansion give us some uber spells, or at least spells that can compare to tanks weapons. Tanks should not be out-damaging us. Thats just a slap in the face.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR><BR>I really don't care how it's done, I just want to be a massive short term offensive damage dealer.  Isn't that what a wizard is?<P>Downside to wizards:<P>- Least self buffed AC of ANY class.  Mages have phantom plate, enchanters and necros have an AC buff.<P>- Low defensive skills with only expensive damage skins to protect.  Pet classes have pets, plus enchanters and necros have virtually the same damage skins.<P>- No real group buffs.  They don't have mana efficent or effective damage shields, They don't summon things, they don't give away my mana, they don't help you regenerate mana, They don't enhance the speed of the tanks, they have invis, and lev, and that's really about it.<P><BR>What Wizards Get:<P>- Roots.  Enchanters have that.  They are unpredictable and nearly impossible to get off while being beat on.<P>- AoE snares.  Don't last long, Atols fizzles like mad, AoE is only helpful in some situations, and extremely detremental in others.  Good for AoE kiting.  With an AoE you can't cast it on something that is beating on you, so unless you can outrun it this isn't an escape spell.  Why do wizards snare anyhow??  Never understood that one.<P>- Teleports.  Druids are better, but nice ability.  Evacs don't get groups.  Evacing is a group killer (you evac, the party is probably done) due to the long distance of travel back to where ever you were hunting.  Teleporting doesn't get groups.  It doesn't make me many lasting friends either, and I generally don't charge.<P>- Sight = Crap.<P>- AoE.  AoE lines are weak in covering all the elements, and are generally considered suicide.  Some AoEs are NEVER useful (al'kabor, some rains).  AoE kiting is one of the two practical implementations of AoEs.  The other is AoE groups, which are extremely rare (risk vs reward) and dangerous.<P>- Direct Damage.  Ahh the shine point right?  <P>Lets look:<BR>With 200 Int and assuming casting till mana doesn't permit:<P>lvl44<BR>Mage (shock)580 * 7 = 4060 max damage in 55.2 seconds<BR>Wizard (conflag)606 * 7 = 4242 max damage in 51 seconds<P>Difference = Wizard wins by 182 damage and 4.2 seconds.  Until you figure in the damage shield and the pet...  There is enough mana left over for a 20hp damage shield and in a minute how much damage did the lvl44 pet do?  Bottom line?  The mage won in fast damage here.<P>lvl52<BR>Mage (char)660 * 8 = 5280 in 41 seconds<BR>Wizard (draught)648 * 10 = 6480 in 50 seconds.<P>Difference = Wizard wins by a much better margin than 44.  1200hp damage and only 9 more seconds to deliver it.  If we are looking at a pure damage per second here: Mage 129dps Wizard 130dps.  Wizard gets to burn a little longer here because of mana efficiency.  Only difference over the next 10 minute med period Wizard contributes nothing, Mage had enough mana left over to keep on person damage shielded the whole time and has a pet.  Roughly 4-6k more damage.  Reguardless of that from the groups perspective the wizard delivers 1.5 more nukes of equal damage every ten minutes.  Does this give the group a reasonable visibility to the difference between the two classes?  Probably not.  Also that group needs to remember that the mage brings a pet, damage shields and resistance debuffers that the whole group can benefit from.  I'd venture to say that most groups would rather have the benefits that the mage brings here.<P>I skipped the lower levels and some of the higher ones, the wizard does come out a bit ahead in dd, the problem is that it really isn't noticable.  <P>- Self Mana Regen.  Harvest at 34.  Nice spell, but really mages are the only ones not holding better cards here.  Heck even druids at high levels have much better mana regen capabilities.<P>The Bottom Line:<P>When a cleric is in the group there is a NOTICABLE difference in healing capability.  When a Warrior is in the group there is a NOTICABLE difference in ability to take damage.  When a wizard is the group I can't tell the difference from when I have a mage in the group or many times even a druid.  I would suggest that if the base class doesn't outshine others in it's specialty that there is a balance issue.  What is any group's motivation to select a wizard over the mage?  I'm not ripping on Mages here, I understand their function good solo class, good short term damage with a decent duration contribution.  My perception is that a Wizard is that it was meant to be a lousy soloer, an AWESOME short term damage dealer, and no duration contributions.  Ask others what they are seeing...  Find out what the damage per second is on a mage on full burn is with his pet and a damage shield.  Find out what a Rogue with high level equipment is doing for damage per second, and then compare it to the wizards...  Is it really that significant?  Giving groups in need of a fast killer a reason to select the wizard?<P><BR>- Xien.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sinneed - I appreciate your comments. A year ago while I was in my 20s I probably would have thought,<P>'yeah, see, someone out there knows that a wizard really is a great class… too many whiners out there'<P>...if I had read your posts back then that is.<P>But now, in my mid-40s I just can't agree with you, despite the fact that I’d really like for you to be correct in your views.<P>I suppose now that I disagree with you, I will most likely be relegated by you as, 'one of those players who can't play a wizard right.' Oh well, perhaps I do still have something to learn about the class...<P>But, I don't believe that the wizard population, as represented by the many posts on this thread, are suffering from some kind of mass delusion. I think there is a lot of truth to the criticisms pointed out on these threads about our class.<P>Two fundamental issues:<P>BAD PRESS<BR>Perhaps wizards are suffering from ‘bad press.’ But if ‘bad press’ is contributing to the problems wizards are having finding a group, you have to wonder why and how that bad press all started. Perhaps it started from some players, that no matter what the capabilities of the wizard are, will always whine. Perhaps it started from insightful players having played the class to the higher levels.<P>My take on it is that the easily-to-whine players ‘felt,’ early on in EQs life, that something was not quite right with the class. However, through there inability to really flesh-out their arguments, they were perceived mostly as whiners. Later on, these ‘feelings’ were validated by a few very well articulated players that reached the higher levels. Unfortunately by then, any well-construed argument regarding the wizard class was summarily debunked by Verant as just more whining. Now the ‘bad press’ issue is somewhat of a vicious circle made up of both false perceptions, whining, as well as quite a few valid criticisms.<P>WIZARD CONCEPT<BR>It’s almost a knee-jerk reaction to accept the fantasy notion that a wizard is physically weak. But if able to achieve great knowledge through many hardships and failures, can ultimately become a very powerful being – one that makes the gods pay attention, one who is subtle, quick to anger, and confronts foes with powerful contempt.<P>I can’t help but believe that Verant, early on, accepted this notion, at least in part, during the development and early deployment of the game – whether they were cognitive about it or not.<P>As the game evolved however, it became a logical goal to ‘balance’ the classes so that each type of player possessed ‘relative’ power to all the other classes. This, however, is the anti-thesis of the fantasy notion-defining wizards. This issue, to me, is the core problem (at a macro level) regarding the wizard class in EQ.<P>Wizards start out weak and frail. By level 60, we arguably are less powerful relative to any other class in the game. Why is that? Why is it that when every casting skill is maxed out, wizards spells cast slower, recast slower, get resisted more, fizzle more, get interrupted more than ever before? Why should my level 4 gate collapse EVER at level 45, when standing perfectly still? It just doesn’t make any sense.<P>Verant is stuck between a rock and a hard place because their initial premise regarding wizards was based on existing fantasy concepts. But their ‘world’ has a vision of its own that cannot mutate this class from existing fantasy into a form workable in the EQ realm that won’t completely unbalance everything.<P>CONCLUSION<BR>I don’t know what the answer is. I do know that I’m frustrated for having played a wizard so long. I really wish I had chosen to play a different class but I didn’t. I do know that quick and easy fixes will not resolve the fundamental problems with this class – in fact, if Verant were to make Wizards viable, the person or people behind such changes should be highly commended for whatever insights they would have come up with to achieve such viability.<P>As it stands now, I’ll continue playing my wizard, because I just don’t have enough interest in the game to start a new character from scratch – especially with so many new games looming on the horizon. I’m just gonna play this wizard until another game captures my interest and my time.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
