</FONT><HR>I think Verant's vision of what a monk should be is quite humorous.  Obviously no one at Verant has pursued even a remedial martial arts experience.<BR>As any knowledgeable martial artist will tell you, the focus of all martial arts is DEFENSE, not OFFENSE.  Although an exceptional martial artist is capable of delivering devistating offensive techniques, it it their superior defensive abilities that keep them in the fight long enough to employ said techniques.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I realize that the lvl 30 quest armors arn't considered high lvl armor, but the fact remains that on my server non-uber guilded people rarely have full suits of this.

</FONT><HR>     I have to say that I feel, as do quite a few others, that if shiverback is not going to be buffed.. which I can't form an opinion on, as my monk has yet to approach the higher levels, then maybe a re-location is in order. Honestly.. anyone can agree it sucks for planar armour.. so remove it from the planes. Put it in in Karnor's, or Old Sebellis, or when vellious goes live, throw it in there somewhere. Not in a place that requires huge co-ordination to try and run, like the planes, but somewhere that a group of mid 40s+ can run in and try and get it to spawn with a 50/50 chance.<P>     Things like this have been done in the past when an item was to powerful for its spawn location(Jboots, etc.), so maybe this should be moved out as well, as it is, according to most monks, too weak for the difficulty of getting it.<P>     I feel that this would make monks alot more happy on average. And then all we would ask for is to be able to compete with warriors again(as previous, I have no comment on this.. in mid levels, I rock non-twinked warriors every time) at the higher levels.<P>Vhoghul Vondhum<BR>Solusek Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I play Everquest with a bunch of my real life friends, In our group we have Monk, Necro, Warrior, Druid, Cleric, and Shaman all around 25th lvl.  They are all looking foward to different things, wether it be new spells,skill, or equipment.  We constantly have to manage where we want to go to fight to help which person get what item or help on what quest.  Theres one person in the group that never cares where we go or what we do, me the monk.  Why? Becuase I already have all of the equipment that I will probaly be wearing for the next 20, maybe 30 lvls.<BR>I am really starting to wonder what I have to look foward to for the next 25 lvls?  <P>The changes we want to Shiverback are not to make monks more powerful, its to give us something to look foward. <P>**  I want to know if anyone else feels that the original intent of the Monk character has been tainted by the Vision.  <BR>I feel like the Monk was intended to have superior skills so that they didnt have to rely on equipment and Pre 50 you can easily make a case for this. <BR>Now look at us, we are reduced to begging for better armor and trying to find the rarest weapon in the game in hopes of being equals to the other Melee classes.<P>Thanks for reading my two cents!<BR>Goralondos<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I'm not a monk, have never played one, but it does seem a little daft to me to have plains armor actually inferior to level 30 armor.<P>However, in this thread, people have been comparing straight AC values. As a non-monk, I'd be interested to know what the stats are on shiverback and on the other things you wear instead, as well as the comparitive weights. For example, if it had agi bonus's, wouldn't that raise your AC overall too? There is more to armor than just plain AC, even if that's the most important factor.<P>Oh, and Creme_Dala_Creme, you can do<BR>    /who all monk count<BR>if you want to know how many monks are on.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The stats on shiverback don't even come close to making up for the low AC, Kianor.  Stats just don't do much, whereas AC does.  You'd have to have a truly collossal amount of agility to make up for even a little raw AC, I mean at least 12ish agility just to make up for 3 AC.  Maybe more like 15 agility, I don't know for sure.  It takes a lot, because raw AC is just a lot better than stats.  I have shiverback gloves, armbands and boots.  The only piece I wear are the boots, outside of a Vox raid or situation where I really desperately need magic resist.  I know what I'm talking about here, and I tell you they suck.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Arikel_Callistrae, thanks for answering.<P>Since I play a ranger, albeit a low/mid level one, I understand that AC is king, really I do! I was still in full banded until 28, even now at 30, after a big re-equip drive, I've not yet replaced all my banded.<P>Stats only come into the equation when the AC is equal or very close to equal. Some of the items that have been mentioned as preferable to shiverback have stats too.<P>I was just curious as to what the other possible advantages to wearing it were, apart from being NODROP on Rallos Zek, that is. Is it lower weight, for example?<P>You say you use yours when you need magic resist, so it can't be entirely worthless. But, saying that, I support the call for the AC on shiverback to be at least as good as other items, because if monks aren't wearing most of their planar gear, something is wrong.<P>Planar should be the pinnacle of your first 50 levels at least, gear wise, and something to look forward to from the point you get your mid-level gear. Other classes get better AC *and* better stats on their gear.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Thanks, Takuan_1, that was exactly what I meant!<P>It shows that while there are some good stats to shiverback, (and very low weight), like I said before, other classes get stat improvements AND AC improvements.<P>I hope they look into the AC on shiverback again. Planar armor shouldn't be banked for occasionally circumstances.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Thats ok. It took a while to compile those figures. What it essentialy shows is that warriors get a hell of a lot AC from planar armour over their standard crafted yet monks actually lose out on AC. The only thing we get really over warriors is agi which still doesn't add enough AC to warrant it fair.<P>People may also say that Warriors need more AC than monks because we naturally have good AC naked and cn block, riposte etc. However, the AC increase is relative i.e. whatever AC boost you give monks and you give the same AC boost to warriors the overall difference will remain constant, so monks are getting nothing they never had but sadly for real we are losing out.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well I have a 29 monk and really have no reason to go to the Planes as I see it.  Nothing good for any monk comesfrom there so apart from being in a group to pull and get exp it pointless. I can get exp and pull in a lot safer places and get better items at the same time. <P>Hybrids suck post 50 it seems and my highest character is a Paladin and my next highest monk has nothing to look forward to.  Wish I had done some research before I chose what classes I did.  I enjoy my monk a real lot but really what is the point if what you work so hard for later on is not worth it.<P>Kodo</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Maybe VI can get off their butts and put more items in the game for us monks (especially high level ones) withOUT upsetting the balance, I mean come on here, we're not asking for ac15 sleeves, or ac10 pants, we just want more LOOT! How hard is that to understand?! You can either use your imagination or just keep on holding the grudge you've had against monks, I swear you've been after us for a whole year, get over it. Forget AC dammit, give us a clickable set with crappy AC, I don't care, it would be SOMEthing at least, hello?<BR>I use shiver wrists for the resists, I use the pants for the resists, I use the arms for the resists, I am sure most "l33t" monks do, there really is a use for them at the high lvl game.<P>I've been hollerin' for weeks about a clickable set from kunark with the SAME AC as shiverback, because I KNOW VI won't up the AC for monks, ok? And they don't want to even do that much, why? Because they are working on the next expansion so they can make more money, and would rather screw up the colors in the existing EQ rather than worry about the "overpowered" monks' needs, heh. Geez, I'm almost sorry I picked a monk VI hates them so much that they abandon them, but EQ needs monks to get anywhere, its the truth. We help others and in turn get spat on by VI, have been for over a year, I'm used to it, and the new monks should to.
