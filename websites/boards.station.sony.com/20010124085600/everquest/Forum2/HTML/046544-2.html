</FONT><HR>It's a great change for groups.<P>It's a mild convenience for druids.  <P>Some will no doubt use it to their advantage.  But really, druid soloing techniques aren't exactly high risk ventures to begin with.  <P>And it might help prevent training problems that many have experienced from inexpert (or uncaring) druids.<P>Overall, it's a good change.

</FONT><HR>this is a group enhancement if i ever saw one.<BR>example:<BR>how many times has a pull come back with more than one mob. the tank needs a heal and the preist casts a heal spell. one of the extra mobs runs to the cleric and begins beating on them. some one casts root to park the mob. shortly after the root breaks and the mob is on a bee line to the cleric and gets to them befor some one can reroot the mob.<P>now the mob can be root packed then snared so the parker has plenty of time to repark after root breaks. this to me is a awsome help to rangers. rangers have done alot of root parking with in groups. they can control argo from the casters like no other class. now they have become the kings and queens of root parking.<P>you may think this helps druid kite or what ever but look at it differently than such-n-such can powergame better than another. look at it that another class that your not mentioning(rangers) can now save your but in a bad pull and argo goes crazzy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, would`nt want to take sides (very mature that there has to be sides by the way!)) as i have a druid and a wiz, but you`re forgeting SOW speed mobs, less concern when yer SOW runs dry mid fight, Druids that are pre-14 have huge advantages now before they get SOW, now it does`nt have to BE 20 yards, less danger of kiting into threat, . . .<P>Come on course it changes the way you play, if it does`nt then don`t use the new approach open to you. No? Oh so it helps then <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I dont think it`s so bad but stop respondin with "It has no impact or advantage on our current tactics".

</FONT><HR>Solos wrote:<P>&gt;”If you remember, a couple months ago Verant put in a patch to make kiting less effective. That is, DoT will do 2/3 dmg if the DoTed mob moves around.”:&lt;<P>This is certainly something that we discussed before making this change.  While it does make kiting slightly easier, it’s not that significant of an improvement to that tactic.  We are anticipating very little change in that particular tactic as a result of this change.  And the overall positive effect to the game system far outweighs what it might or might not do to kiting.  We’ve never stated that kiting is a tactic that we are against, as a rule.  The change you mentioned was made because at that time the tactic was, essentially, a risk-free method for gaining experience.  The change to Root might very well make this tactic a bit easier, but we don’t think that it will be risk-free.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think this is a excellent improvement.  Makes the whole groups life easier, and if it makes those who like to solo's life easier, great for them too.  If you're bothered that a Druid can solo better than what you're playing, then make yourself a druid.  If your bothered that Necro's can solo better than what you're playing, then make a necro.  Nobody is forcing you to play your class.  My primary is a Warrior, can I solo?  Not really worth it at all, and in a lot of cases, just plain can't.  Do I want solo classes nerfed because of this?  Hells no, that's rediculas.  I have a Mage for when I wanna solo, a druid as well.<BR>Snare and root now stack, that's awesome.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I will admit that the ability to root/snare and dot med is nice.  Why bullchit?  It's a good addition.  It's a safer way to solo, period.<P>There's very little added benefit in terms of how exp is gained though.  Dont forget, you're still sitting on your butt meditating while the dot goes off.  And dont forget that each time the root breaks, you stop medding to reroot.  You loose some meditate efficiency there (one of those stat guys worked out that broken meds are slower than straight thrugh meds even if you just get up and sit down immediately by a significant percent).<P>Gonna Root/Dot multiple mobs?  Ok .. now you have to wonder which root broke  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  And you *KNOW* the chance to be KS'ed increases with each mob.  And if you're blowing the mana for multi dots and roots, you may as well QuadKite.<P>So, you still have the downtime, it's just downtime during the "fight" rather than after.<P>Also .. as pointed out .. Druids soloed before, they'll solo after.  All you're doing is *****ing about something that has NO CHANCE of giving *YOU* a positive effect.  If they leave it, no positive effect for you.  If they change it, no positive effect for you.<P>There is a negative effect.<BR>First, you piss people off.  Guess you didnt need friends to group with anyway, right<BR>Second, you have potential for ruining the game for people.  Ah, who cares about people in the game?<BR>Third, you have potential for ruining the game for yourself.  Nerfing another class may make that class not available for your group.  Or worse, in a case like me, it takes away the fun of my main character, so i take my cleric with me when i /q the game.<P>Leave the damn druids alone.  Leave the damned necros alone.  Leave the damned clerics alone.  Just play the game.<P>I dont get it ... ok .. lets say they nerf the druids ... or the necros ... do you sit there and rub your hands together, laughing menically like the madman you are, saying "He He He, i showed them .. they cant solo anymore .. he he he"  ***?<P>Rexron Toebiter (Deliverance)<BR>Druid in the 41st Season of Karana's Cleansing Rain<BR>Anyone have a spare SoW?<BR>Rexron checks his back pocket.

</FONT><HR>Before change: <P>Root-Dot is a safe, effective means of soloing for druids, necros, and shaman (maybe more, I don't know)<P>After change: <P>Root-dot is an even safer, but not any more efficient means of soloing for druids, and perhaps a bit more efficient for necros (extra dot with darkness) maybe, I'm not a necro. In any case, it doesn't add a heck of a lot) not much change for shaman.<P>I don't know how to break this to you, but druids have been using root to get around the dot nerf since about 2 days after the nerf was put into effect. Root-DoT has never been very dangerous, so the added safety doesn't make a heck of a lot of difference. I root-dotted before, and I'll keep root-dotting -when I'm not quad kiting  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P>It DOES give a huge advantage to those 15 or 20 druids across all the servers that have an epic.  *sarcasm on*Better nerf them, quick!

</FONT><HR>Ard1 no one is saying it's useless, just not any additional use. The tactic sb described for karnors could have just as easily been done before the patch. Snare is a L1 spell costing 15 mana. If a druid wanted to resnare every time root broke prepatch it cost a big 15 mana (why be an idiot and use ensnare with root?) and it would be a pretty pathetic druid who couldn't channel snare through a few hits from a mob.<P>Absor is right on this one, the gain for soloing is negligable. The real gain is in groups, where no longer will mages be yelled at for wanting to use earth pets and root parking won't overwrite the snaring that was already done.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>  Unfortunatly for those of us playing on a PvP server, this patch makes combat with someone who has snare even *more* horribly frustrating than it already was.<BR>  After the patch I open up Everquest and scan down the changes made, then I see a heading:<BR>  *Root and Snare*<BR>  I think to myself: "Wow, thank god, they are shortening snare's duration and making root stick longer."<BR>  But no, snare is enhanced. Really, do necros and druids need to be made better? Most players will admit that these are very powerful classes in the game, and player vs. player with these characters is in heavy imbalance in their favor. I understand that EverQuest was not made with PvP in mind, but please take this into consideration and don't patch in favor of classes with way too many great spells in their book already. <BR>  In all of my experience with a 30th lvl Ogre Shaman who grew up in Nek forest/East Commons, a light/dark tension spot, my root has lasted about<BR>30 seconds vs. players, max. Usually much less around 10 seconds. Where as snare lasts around 3 to 7 minutes, and I get cut down either by the following spells, which I can't possibly evade, considering I don't think I've ever been attacked by anything less than a red druid when he/she is solo, or by any melee class. Not to mention the *poor* players who picked a melee class and have to fight against snare, they crawl around for the better part of 5 minutes while casters chew their hit points down. They have no way to defend or combat this.<BR>  However, there was an escape from the awful duration of this spell, root yourself to break it, the only way to get out of certain death. After all, there is no running from *anyone* while snared, it might as well *be* a root. <BR>  I often wonder how druids and necros ever die with such spells, the mobs (and players) simply can't catch you. <BR>  I would love to hear about the benefits of this change, I really can't think of one reason this needed to be done, besides the running trend that seems to be making the overpowered slightly better with every few patches. Many of the players I have talked to are *very* disapointed with this part of the patch, as am I.  <P>  <BR>  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is a strong improvement to the safety of the root/dot method.  Just wish people would stop talking about kiting since it didn't change kiting method one bit.<P>To the priest : Ok, you can single kill some mobs you couldn't before -- so what.  If you are single killing at 48 instead of multi-kiting you ain't coming anywhere near the real potential of a druid to level.  I did 42 thru 50 in 4 to 6 hours per level by multi-kiting.  No matter how safe they make root/dotting it will never even come close to what druids and wizards to with multi-kiting using AE spells.<P>And I'm just doing these with raw mana from wisdom.  The people who have luminescent staffs do this all the way to 59 or 60 because they can multi-kite almost any non-casting mob that isn't big enough to summon (50 or less) and anything 45 or higher will give you blue xp to 60.  The only thing they waste mana on snare spells so they seldom have to stop to med.  It's a bit slower per kill with a level 34 AE spell and the timing is tricky against some mobs but you can do it almost non-stop and the xp flies right on thru those Kunark levels that drive everyone else mad.<P>You want to balance people as far a levelling then take away the mana free damage toys and do something to change multi-kiting like have mobs change speed at 50% health or something.  Then you'll really hear the soloist scream =)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>To kite or not to kite; that is the question!<BR>---------------------------------------------<P>The real issue is not about KITING at all.  The way I see it is pretty clear.  Druids are now going to be able to do the same damage for the same mana with little difference using the Root/Snare/DoT method.  Damage shmamage, the real problem this is creating is that druids who use this method are at least 50% less likely to EVER take any damage (after the initial snare sticks) and probably 90% less likely to ever die (no risk).  I'm not saying I want all druids to die, but I am saying that this method is TOO EASY.<P>The other problem is also evident; with druids not getting hit those 2 to 4 swings from mobs after the root breaks (like it use to be) they don't have to spend the mana to heal themselves after the battles, thus causing them to have LESS DOWNTIME.  Great, on to the next mob.<P>Lastly, I would like to make it clear why I specified DRUIDS and not Wiz's or Necro's.  Wizard snare only lasts 1 minute, root can last longer.  Necro snare only lasts 90 seconds, root can last longer.  Druid snare lasts 3 minutes, and ENSNARE lasts 6 minutes, root doesn't last that long.  Pretty much the benefit of this change is 90% to the druids.<P>I do agree that the change will be a benefit to the groups, especially ones that require an enchanter, but in the longrun this change benefits a single class much more than any other... Druids.<P>What I would LOVE to know is WHY did Verant decide this?  It came out of nowhere...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Speaking as a druid, I really wouldn't care less if they took this change out. As many have said all it does is make root-dotting slightly safer. First of all, root-dotting was never very dangerous to start with. Second, most druids who can, quad-kite. This change has ABSOLUTELY no effect on that.<P>So go ahead, take it out. I think the class that would be hurt most is mages. They have been dying to show the world how valuable their earth pets are in a group, but have never been able to, because no group who had a snarer would allow earth pets. A lot of other classes that like to root can also feel safe in doing so now.<P>I rarely root-dot anymore, the XP are just too slow. If I want to solo, I will quad-kite. So if you really think this change is unbalancing for druids, this druid says take it out. I dont want  to be accused of tipping balance.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Then sometimes when I had to switch to a standard kiting technique, I would get another(second) message that said that "ensnaring root has worn off"(should have written the message down). But essentially read like the root's time had worn off. These usually came when I could not re-root the mob.  Bug maybe?

(plus all thouse great utility spells).<P>/Class envy off.<P>/Player extreemly pissed on,, but its only a game....<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>This thread is double funny.<P>To the poster:  Players have been doing that well before this patch.   The standard tactic is to snare, DoT, Root, move far away and med. When root cancels (you get a message now) you are far enough aways to reapply snare then reapply root.   I've seen many different Druids that use this tactic.  <P>Absor:  Your post didn't make sense, even though it repeated exactly what Verant said when they changed DoTs.    It was *supposed* to eliminate a risk-free way of getting experience.. it didn't eliminate it.   It never has eliminated it, it only made it slighly less mana efficient.   The tactic still exists, has always existed, is as "risk-free" as it always has been (really not risk free, but certainly very low risk) and the only difference is it is a little less mana efficient.  The only way you could change it to make it not risk free is to have snare act like root and create a chance for it to break when a MoB takes damage -- something that would really have people upset since it would create huge trains in dungeons and something I wouldn't be an advocate of.   <P>As for the change itself, as a Magician I love it. It means that I will have more freedom in pulling out my Earth pet when a ranger/druid is in the group.  I'd always hated the fact that Earth was mainly for soloing (and it wasn't the best solo pet).   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>While it is not risk free, it is *VERY* nice.<P>The solo part of it does, IMO, make my druid (immediately) and wizard more powerful (once the nuke-breaking-snare fix is in).<P>It should also a huge soloing help to Necros who have PE at 49.<P>The value in dungeons is going to be MAGNIFICENT, though.<P>I simply cannot wait to tear into the froggies in Seb and try this out.<P>With multiple casters rooting, and druid snare, Necro/Shaman/Druid DOTs running, wizards to make the killing blow, tanks to hold the breakers still, the frogs are gonna die a lot.<P>I think people are missing the fact that this is a GREAT enhancement for those areas where runners cannot always be stopped and a runner means death.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First of all, this isn't class envy, someone brings up a point that Verant might have missed and everything starts whinning, 'oh leave the class alone, wah wah wah'.<P>This change will probably become undone within a few months, if not then it should be. As an enchanter I root/dot/dd in killing my mobs. If I have sow I can do this no problem, just need a decent sized area. If I don't it's risky, a lot of the times root is broken too often and I run out of mana or get beat up too much (fear means dot's do less dmg so I tend not to fear unless in wide open area and dots just ran out and/or mob is close to death).<P>The root/nuke technique can be used anywhere, in a dungeon, outdoors, etc. <P>I do die oocasionally with this technique but if the mob was snared as well, there is no way to die, worst that would happen is I'd have to run away. Druids have always been able to do this (without a snared mob they just had to have sow on). Now their life will become 100x easier, and for necros this will be wonderful. Darkness the mob, root, dot, sit and med, repeat. Let the pet in on the battle once the mob is down to about 30% hp.<P>A rooted mob breaking was a scarey thing since you had to be far away or run and try to squeeze off a root, one resist and you were face to face with the mob, and necros and druids can't melee worth crap at higher levels, only reason druids can stand in battle is cuz of heal and dmg shields, but now you can cast a few roots if need be without even being touched.<P>Do I care? Yes and no, my two best friends in game are a druid and necro so they were estatic and we all laughed at how easy it was for them now. Can they both solo better then my mage and every other character, yes (at least my mage is more group friendly then the necro, not by much but hey :) <P>I think the original poster, as well as myself, just wanted to make sure Verant really thought through this change. Soloing for necros and druids just became a whole lot easier, not slightly, but drastically. At least druids don't need to kite as much, hopefully they'll just snare/root and 'kite' in a small area versus running all over the damn place :)<P>Lastly the big deal of rooting versus kiting is with kiting you can go oom much easier since you can't med. With root lasting a good minute (with enchanters up to 1 1/2 minutes) you can root a mob, dot and med up a bubble. Root breaks, no more worries just walk a little, repeat. At least there was a risk before, now no risk.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Its obvious that Whoopee doesn't play a druid (or at least, one that could root kite before).<P>At level 35, my druid can root/kite or snare/kite, all depending on the resists. Lets check out the danger: Last death: Sol A, in a group... not kiting. Death before that? To GrimFeather at level 26 or so, a 35 necro and I had just killed a griffon, so we decided to try our hand at him. We failed miserably heh.<P>So, lets see, my druid solo kited Tesch Mas Gnolls from level 24 to 32 without a death there. Hrm. So far, its HG/SG 0, Me 15 or so. This ALL without the new snare/root. So safety is not a problem, unless you don't know how to play a druid.<P>As far as the healing goes, I take more damage from falling than I do from creatures. I usually let normal regen take care of it. If the battle is over, I may cast regen now. I have almost 800hp at 35, so even a SG smacking me for 180 is nothing to worry about (considering I heal 3 hp a tick while sitting, and I sure will be sitting after the battle, I can heal most of that 180 just medding, and the rest while looking for something to kill). So this change does not save me healing mana (at least at this level). I have a level 15 druid who has to heal after battles, but that is because I "porcupine" instead of kite.<P>What does this change do? It eases my nerves while waiting for the root message, that's about it. Grouping wise, inside dungeons (something I don't do often, but may do more of with this change), its great.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/046544-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/046544.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/046544-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=046544&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=046544&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
