</FONT><HR>Ok, about the balance stuff, I am currently a 35 wizzie on Luclin, when i was 34 i was hunting tizmaks in GD, I would have to take the solo one wandering around because i was not able to to take the proper to guards at a time, Well I spent my time there I saw both necros and mages at my lvl and lower be able to solo both these tizmaks at the same time, actually when the mage did it, he just through his pet on it, and the pet actually killed the tizmak itself, the mage did not have to touch it, So if the mage has the dd arsenal to kill the tizmak on his own like i do as a wizzie, and then he has a pet on the side who kills another for double the exp, this does not seem balanced to me. If i tried to do this i would be wooped, My aoe snare can not hit both of them at the same time, the root can not hold long enough to keep the one off my while i am killing the other, and if both get on me there is no way i am going to live, they are just to fast and i cant get a spell off. This does not seem "Balanced to me at all" I think if you are going to make wizzies the ULTIMATE NUKERS then have them do it, make are nuke a lot more better than the other classes, sure our nuke put out a little more dmg, but not enough to compensate for the pets that they have. I dont think it is fair to keep things how they are. Wizzards are at a clear disadvantage here. At least untill you get to lvl 50 up,, but most of the game is not played through that time. I just want to see wizzies to be able to fight aswell as the other casters. I am not saying give us pets,, but make are roots better, and nukes way more better at low and mid lvls. I hope this gets read and thank you for your time<BR>~Pairadox Manaburner - Luclin Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sadly, nothing has been done to address our MAJOR issues and nothing will be.  The class is way too broken for VI to retool the game to fix it.<P>You're done with your wiz folks.  Please pick another class and move along now.<P>And BTW-- if us wiz are no longer supposed to be the 'Masters of Damage' as we were fed in the original instruction manual, but some other BS thing like 'Masters of Seeing Things Afar and Getting There', then answer me this:  Why are 90% of our spells EVOCATION?

</FONT><HR>Here's an idea.  One of the things I like doing as a wiz in a group (and which I think contributes nicely to what the group is doing) is stunning.  Of course, this doesn't work on large mobs and we can't stun all that often.<P>But what if we could?  Give us a new stun that stuns any size creature and can be casted just a bit more often, and I think we'd be a much more popular group member. <P>Stuns are pretty much useless when soloing, so this wouldn't make us better soloists.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Was in OOT last night. Got the camp for the AC together with a 52 necro. I am a lev 40 wizard. So i tried to kill a normal cyclops placeholder that conned blue to me. <P>Necro slowed and feared it and sent pet on it. After that i pumped in my complete mana supply. when i got a full resists on my magic based dd, i changed to Ice dd, till i got a resist on that. <P>I needed 80% of my mana (Int 192) to kill it. And that while a pet was beating it too.<P>Conclusion: To much resists, and too little mana for me to kill a blue con.<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>SteveX,<P>This will be encroaching enchanter territory.<P>But they idea is good, if we say that we do it by smacking them upside the head with force, rather than a kind of mezmerization by pretty colors, mind control, etc...<P>So, New Tishan's clash type spells that stun and do damage and say "x has been hit by the might of wizards and is stunned upside the head!"<P>That's okay.

</FONT><HR> Yeah Dr., that may be our only hope.  An irresitable eight second stun against any mob. Do some work on our resists, remove the level cap, and cut manna cost a little on all casters for all spells, a better manna regen, and cut the resist rate if you are using the right lure.<P>Who wouldnt want a wizard there stunning that uber mob two or three times in a fight. It wouldnt make us solo better cause i gonna quad kite anyway till they nerf it cause absor just doesnt like it.  Oh yeah, Ab, and answer like i dont like it doesnt cut the mustard.  Why dont your like and specifically how does it affect balance overall.<P>Oh,Ab, you dont like the quad kiting, but its fine for a wizard and most hybrid casters to be useless in velious.  I tell you what i hate, I hate that shield of the magi.  What on God's green earth is the point behind that long cast. What was the dev team thinking? Wish one of you guys could tell me how a three second cast on the frigging spell for everybody would affect the game ?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

So you (dark elf) and your KoS party members die by the hands of the guards.<P>(Cant they change the Karana Evac to the pyramid in South Karana. Paw here we come)<P>- you get a tell to be in a group and start checking which character you logged in, what time it is, and where you are going.<P>- you are in a 4 wizard, 1 bard, 1 druid group. The bards get bored of the same song all the time. the druid fell asleep. and the bard can not keep up pulling the blues out of the field. (happened to me in the Overthere. 4 wizards shouting for a group decided to join up)<P>- you are seriously considering getting a wife that has an enchanter.<P>- your guild members start asking why you are so active on guildchat, and ask if you are OOM again.<P>- All you remember from the guildraid is the LOADING, PLEASE WAIT for every guildmember you escorted from all over Norrath to the party.<P>- They forbid you to get drunk on guildmeetings because you have to drive.<P>- You can make alot of newbies happy with a longlasting 5pt dmg shield.

</FONT><HR>Here is what i feel as a 37th wizard who in my opinun knows his class pretty well...<P>Wizards are the "masters of arcane knowledg" and so don't get a pet.  However, mages get a pet *why dosent anyone take that into account when compairing the classes?* Mages have a worse mana/level ration however, they get tishani or whatever..also they can out nuke us even if they don't get new spells every spell level.  Mages 300+dmg +a pet that dual hits for 40 and tanks seems kinda like it is better than a wizarards 1 time nuke at 39.   <P>Wizard Grouping demand=Nonexhistant what can be done?  Majorly revamp a wizy or nerf mages.  Wizards are usually the last to be accepted to a group from my exp.<P>I suggest reworking the wizard from say 34 and up.<P>Ensnaring roots lasting time should be increased. Also perhaps some kind of "sow" spell or wizy only jboot type item if not working on grouping.  As is wizys cannot group and must solo bassically through the majority of 32 and up maybe more havent gotten there yet =)<P>Enstill=you know it sux plz fix it.<P>My suggestions as to dmg due to the SoV problem add 20dmg per level 30-45 and +50 dmg till 50 and 50+ +100 dmg per level to the hardest hitting spells, adjust resists or give us a tishani like spell.  Also reevaluate mana costs and even it out.  Also keep in mind that to make this class what it is generally ment to be we should have more mana the cheapest and hardest hitting spells.<P>I meen good god there is a seriouse problem if you can be 35in a 30 40 zone with 60 other people and not get a group in 2 hours even if you play your class extremly well.<P>Cannot tell you how many times i have sat there /shout 35 wizard lfg well equiped..<P>and seen others clerics, rogues, u name it come in and get a group instantly.<P>Well im done hope you considerthis</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Aramalg,<P>I really like the idea of the retaliatory strike. I don't think it will do much for increasing the desirability of wizards in groups, but it's a great role-playing device.<P>However, I was having too much fun imagining the consequences and came up with the following thoughts. Suppose the result of the wizards death was a huge (if he has lots of mana anyway) explosion. Then it would make sense if the retaliatory strike was a PBAE.<P>Heehee! Imagine playing on one of the PVP servers. Now the party is going to have a pressing need to keep the wizard alive...<P>SomeCleric_00 g/ Oh no, OOM... the wiz is gonna blow!!! <P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> Of course, the real effect would be that no one would want the wiz in the group. Still, if the wiz was careful, at least his death would be meaningful -- has anyone ever watched Dragonslayer?<P>And then there's always the great evil fun you could have with this spell. A high level wiz, who's tired of soloing, goes to the nearest newbie grounds. He or she then meds to full mana and pokes one of the guards with his staff near the assembled low level characters... BOOM!!! Half a dozen dead newbies, maybe a guard or two, not to mention the rats, snakes and bats that happened to be to close.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Sorry, Aramalg, I'm not trying to make fun of your idea.

</FONT><HR>Mad Cow Disease and the Skyfire Evac<P>Disclaimer: I'm aware that it is debatable whether or not evac locations are considered wizard 'class balance' issues. But just in case they are, here you go:<P>Ok being the sick EQ addict that I am, I noticed a strange similarity today between the logic behind the skyfire evac location and proponents against the ban of blood donations from US citizens having been in Europe in the 80s and 90s.<P>Just in case you're not up on the latest mad cow disease issue:<P>Mad cow disease, at least according to the US press, is spreading in Europe. This has led to concerns about blood donations to the Red Cross from US citizens having extended stays (a month or longer) in Europe during the 80s and 90s.<P>Here's where my sick addiction to EQ gets involved. I noticed that one of the proponents AGAINST this ban suggested that there are, “…many judgements that can lead to many outcomes in this issue [the blood ban], and that no single judgement is correct.” This person went on to defend her position against the ban, primarily because the ban will cause major blood supply shortages.<P>Now, according to this person, it should be allowable for those who are possibly infected with mad cow disease to donate blood to the Red Cross. But think about this. Why do people need other people's blood? Usually, because they are in a life and death situation, and external blood is needed to sustain their life. But if the blood is infected with yet another disease that will end your life anyway, then what is the point?<P>The purpose of an evac is to move the group out of harms way in an emergency, not put them in an even worse situation, much like a blood transfusion is supposed to save your life, not end it in the near future.<P>Well, I sighed, as this type of logic (or lack of) seems pervasive in all things, real or virtual. It’s no wonder then that certain game design concepts are implemented the way they are. At least a flawed game design implementation based on questionable logic won’t kill you.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Well if we are forced to solo then we should be allowed the same exp as all the people now getting bonus exp from groups and also the groups in dungeons (which we can't solo!). <P>Here is my solution if Verant wants to be like this:<BR>Give us a PB AE root casting time 0.2 seconds, hits unlimited mobs.<BR>Give us PB AE stuns casting time 0.2 seconds, unlimited hits.<BR>Problem solved, if Verant wants us to solo then at least let us pretend we are in a group by killing mass mobs!

</FONT><HR>I must admit, the idea of familiars is really appealing.  They could just use the graphic of whatever 'yard trash' is in the zone, and they could, depending on the component used in the spell, give 1 of the following effects:<BR>    1) Increased mana regen<BR>    2) Increased effect (damage, duration, etc.)<BR>    3) Cast time decrease<BR>    4) Increased penetration (mobs resist less)<BR>    5) Other stuff that I can't think of right now.<BR>In addition, the familiar wouldn't be a combat pet, but maybe a one shot aggro sink, where the mob would attack the familiar first if the wiz over burned or something.  The familiar would die quickly, but not too quickly letting the wiz nuke again or port or whatever.  <P>The only prob. I see with this is that it doesn't really make the wizard more group friendly.<P>It could be a spell line maybe getting a new (stronger) familiar every 6 levels or so (6, 12, 18, etc. up to 60)<P>Probably use gems as components... fire opal for inc. damage for example.<P>Definitely needs more thought and balance, but might give wizards a little more distinctiveness, and it would be fun too.<P>Just a thought...<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My friends absor will be posting to us later i hope. However there are a few issues that i would like to bring up and/or rehash that others have spoken about. First of all i find grimstaff's posts to be very useful and well written. Now onto the nitty gritty.<P>Wizards are supposed to be the masters of quick damage. So states the general idea and concept behind the wizard class. Can we do damage quick? Oh most certainly. I can drop 5 draughts on a mob faster than the dots fall or someone else nukes, however who really cares about that measly damage when it comes to the big mobs. Ok enough of that mini-rant i will express the issues at hand one by one.<P>1. Damage<BR>In the old world wizards could stand their ground well enough. The MOBS had hp upwards to about 32k which for all intents and puposes leaves a lot of room for the average wizard to perform. In kunark our ability to perform drops to a lower teir, to kill a low blue mob the wizard must expend the majority of his/her mana and then sit for the next 10 minutes or so. In velious we are forgotten. In plane of growth who cares if I am around burning through every stitch of mana that I have just to do approximatly 8k on a mob when it has 100k hp. Wouldn't it be more efficant to just get a mage pet? What I and the majority of the wizard community are asking for is that damage is looked at. We are not efficant enough. We are no longer needed for these types of encounters. Damage has been addressed for tanks yet wizards are still doing the same amount across the board. Damage must be incresed to make us stand out at the so called masters of damage... at least enough to make us not a liabilty in groups. If damage is not increased then cost should be decreased to improve effiancy.<P>I personally really like the idea of a % dmg spell. That would really increase our throughput on the bigger mobs. Enough has been said about this type of spell so i will let it be.<P>2. The al'kabor line<BR>I laughed everytime I recieved another one of these spells. The overuse of mana for not enough damage makes them useless. The only time i have ever used them is just to see the sparkly effects once, and just once when i first got it. These spells need a big overhaul. The best recommendation which i find extreamly interesting is make it a PB spell castable on a target player with all aggro assocaited with that spell transfered to the target. This would go a long way to helping the line accually be useful, but still not a steady point to helping grind-it-out groups. Mana costs should be lowered and make it PB castable on target. <P>3. Resists<BR>At level 35 i was told that i would gain a natural debuff across the board for my spells. I seem to have never seen a true natural debuff. Other classes are given many utilites to debuff their targets, wizards only hope is the non-functional natural debuff. Please fix this.<P>4. Fizzles<BR>Sadly I have gone back to bonds of force for kiting. This is because of the nasty fizzle rate on atol's. My mana pool is already hurting enough when i burn through all my mana to take down one mob, i hate to waste that much mana on 2 or 3 fizzles just to snare it. Also fizzle rate on Shield of the Magi is horrible. With my current downtime 3 or 4 fizzles which is normal with a very good skill in the area is unnaceptable for a spell that costs 300 mana wasting too much on fizzles just to pul it off once. By reshielding myself i add at least 3-5 more minutes of downtime, not sure how much depends on the number of fizzles.<P>5. Lures<BR>Lures are the spells that are supposed to hit correct? Resist rates too high on this line of spell.<P>6. Mana dependancy<BR>We are the most mana dependant class in the game, yet we are given two things to help us with mana regen. Harvest and manaskin. With this we get a kinda sorta maybe breeze by holding up those slots and for the costs of peridots. Harvest post 50 no longer works correctly giving the wizard back less mana then it should it appears to have capped itself. Please fix. A harvest line should be added. Possiblities include harvest(34) harvest2(44), harvest3(54). This would help a lot with steady progression. Now before it is said that we would be able to regen too much mana I would like to point out that druids get two spells with the integrated abilites of breeze and clarity equivalents, as group buffs. Wizards should at least be able to expand our manapool faster. As for manaskin I understand that the one point of mana back per tick is seen as a sort of gimme add on. Perhaps this should be moved up to 2 or perhaps 3 points of mana back per tick. This would make it more useful.<P>In addition wizards should be able to have a greater meditate skill, perhaps when lower on mana it would go at say 1.2x or 1.3x. Or this could be dependant on the number of people in the group. The more people the better regen.<P>7. Personal buff lines<BR>Can we perhaps recieve upgrades to resistant skin and elemental armor? Low level skins should also be implemented for the young wiz. With low level componants or perhaps a mana only cast.<P>8. Epic weapon<BR>This retrival on this is not based on skill but sheer luck. All drops come off of mobs that take a long time to spawn and the drop rate is extreamly low. The neccasry componants for this quest should be gained on skill not on luck of the roll for the item if it drops at all.<P>9. Rain spells<BR>Please decrease the resistant checks on this type of spell. I really do hate constantly recieving 2 full resists on a 3 wave attack. In addition pets should be removed from the waves as well as increasing the total number of waves by one perhaps.<P>10. Teleportation<BR>Skyfire- for an evac this is senseless, it will put people into a grotesque amount of danger. If you are already hurting this spot will just end up tearing you apart. This should be moved to share the evac spot of the druids or pathing around the wiz evac point should be safer. Ie. the wurms and such should be scared of the magical area of the wiz evac and perhaps avoid the innards of the circle of bones surrounding it.<P>WK- I always wished this could be near the barbarians at the fishing village, it would make it useful.<P>Cazic- Its dangerous but thats the price we pay correct? Its a regular port but a deathtrap to young wizzies. Perhaps pathing in that room should be made like the idea suggested for skyfire evac.<P>11. Group friendlyness<BR>We have absolutly nothing to offer a group except the possiblity of an evac, which is generally unwanted in larger raids where a rez is much more efficant. Please give us something to offer. It's much more efficant to get a druid who can port them, do the damage and act as a backup healer. We just nuke, but were easy to be replaced by anyone. Please dont make us all perma-taxis.<P>12. Concussion/brainbite<BR>Difficulty of quest to great. Groups of 50's needed to complete a quest for a lev 39 spell. This is unnacceptable. We need this to survive in groups as a only possible source of escape.<P>13.Abscond<BR>My only gripe about this spell is the dangerous location of 'safe spot' that we are dropped in skyfire. It is in the middle of the pathing of many mobs. This should be moved to BW zone line, or to the tunnel to OT.<P>14. Class definition<BR>We lack it. Everything we do someone else does it too, and most likely just as well. If we are comprable to the warrior we should be defined as such, being the best at doing our job. Give us something to make it that way. <P>15. Quests<BR>Overall quests for wizards are too few, and items recieved from said quests do too little. Staff of temperate flux should have its resistances increased to at least 15 instead of 6 since this ability does not stack anyway. All other classes have more quests then us for class specific items. <P>16. PVP<BR>The whole reason this is such a touchy issue is because of the implications of PVP combat. Damage on wizard spells should be upped but get even a greater divider when cast on another player. Sadly why our class cant have what we need to be to survive is because of PVP combat.<P>17. Class specific skills<BR>Perhaps giving post 50 disiplines to be able to cast for a given length of time without the comsumtion of mana. Another could be one without the generation of aggro. The one I like the most is if wizards are supposed to be masters of knowledge then perhaps we should gain an innate ability to resist being summoned by those 51+ mobs.<P>Conclusion:<BR>We are not asking for pets, we are not asking to be the gods of Norrath, we arent even asking to gain enchancements. We just are asking to be fixed. Currently the wizards are stuck soloing because we have no other use, no other true role to play. We lack defination and the ability to live up to the title of masters of damage. Please make us useful.<P>Etudar Stormweaver<BR>Evoker of the 55th Circle<BR>Officer of the Nameless Lords<BR>The Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
