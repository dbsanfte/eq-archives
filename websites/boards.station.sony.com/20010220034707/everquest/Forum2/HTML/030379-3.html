</FONT><HR>Quoted from eq.castersrealm.com bit on this post:<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Here's the deal. Following Velious we will begin to freeze aspects of the game. We will become as firm on various issues as we have been on subjects such as melee binding or experience curves. Things that aren't related to content will be closed down. First skills and their caps, stats, etc, followed by spells from the bottom up. We'll then start reviewing some of the rarer items as well as quest rewards. Within a month or two we'll get to the point that we'll be focusing solely on content-related issues such as implementing new quests, fixing old ones, and more or less moving forward all of the time.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<P>.<BR>.<BR>This sounds like a really good thing.  That is when they get it all working they way they want it.<P>after almost 2 years now?? (is it really that long since it came out??) you would think many of the issues are SOLVED and do not need anymore looking into.   (and many issues have been solved)<P>I play a shaman (always have) and for the most part feel they are balanced... (ya i feel some classes may be over powered in SOME areas of combat, just like shamans are in some areas....  its funny and scary at the same time when my friend goes out and QUAD kites blues with his wizard and gets a quarter of a bub of XP at 49 ever time he does so. but hey.. he only can do it in a few places and live)<P>have fun enjoy the game .. get upset if you feel like something is busted..  but sooner or later a large number of issues are not going to be issues for those that have played with em for a long time.  (newbies to the game may have problems.. but if the FAQ or whatever has all the FIRM issues listed and what not..  that should cover it.)<P><BR>Thats my 2 coppers..<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think you need to distinguish false information from intentionally misleading information.  When a company has intellectual property to protect, they often will create a smokescreen around that information.  Some of the information will be intentionally misleading mainly to misdirect attention.<P>Any information relevant to new spells that you find in a game file on your box is covered by the license agreement and you must have Sony's permission before revealing it.  In game spells that are presented as part of the game environment at fan sites get treated differently because they are part lore and part hint.  The game file itself is neither--it is protected, licensed property.<P>When you or anyone else chooses to reveal protected, licensed information, you run two real risks:<P>1.  You could be held liable for the publication of damaging information.<BR>2.  The misleading information can be used to prove your source.<P>Traditionally telephone white pages contained intentionally misleading 'seed' listings.  When a competitor copied that information without proving it, then the telephone company would use the seed listings to prove the source of the competitors listings.  The infringing company would then have to explain how they could have copied the 'seed' listings without infringing on the original company's intellectual property.  <P>Up until a case just a year or so ago, the originating telephone company's ownership of the telephone listings was protected using this approach.  That case made public phone numbers part of the public domain and made them non-protectable.  Rest assured that Sony/Verant won't suffer the same fate anytime soon based on fantastic elements such as spell names contained in their speff.dat file.<P>In conclusion, sometimes companies use intentionally misleading information in order to create a smokescreen around their intellectual property.  Publishing their data and specifically the misleading information provides a fingerprint that can be used to trace the information to a source and prove infringement of national and international intellectual property laws.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Are you under the delusion that people whine less when they know more?  Heh, it just gives them more material to nitpick and whine about, because they will insist on comparing ONE single aspect of a class to a different -single- aspect of a class (ranger vs. warrior defense, for example) without looking at the big picture.  The more information Verant gives out, the easier they make it for people to start nitpicking about single class vs. class issues down to an absurd, atomic level.<P>The very detailed and explicit test results of warrior vs. monk damage that Abashi posted was a wonderful example.  He was -very- detailed in that post, and quite correct in his testing methodology.  He did everything he could to eliminate all other variables, etc etc.<P>The whines INCREASED following his test results.<P>It was pathetic.  I think monks on that thread single handedly brought Abashi to the point where he will never try to give that level of detail out again.  And so far, he hasn't.  I can't blame him.  The behavior of the whiners on that thread was downright PATHETIC.<P>Eh, I shouldn't say it was just monks.  Lots of classes have done it.

</FONT><HR><BR>Gordon,<P>I am at the high end of the age group playing EQ.  I have been making business decisions for over 30 years.  (I am in excess of 40 terran years) You say you are going to freeze certain parts of the game to concentrate on the content aspects of the game.  BRAVO!!!!  <P>I stopped visiting this board 9 months ago and only recently started posting again.  The reason?  Nothing but flames and at that time I saw very little in response from Verant on the board.  I am pleased that you have taken time to respond.<P>IMHO, you have catered too much to the whims of the players.  You have spent too much time on making changes to quiet the loudest voices.  That is good in one sense.  You have responded to your customers and have bettered the game.  But in catering to them you have ... and here is that word, used differently ... you have SUCKED the resources of your programming staff from doing the creative building of the game.<P>As long as you 'react' to the *****ing you can not act towards the building of a better game.  You have finite resources.  I believe that you make your best effort to identify and correct bugs EQ.  But rather than spending time on balancing the game for the complainers, which you can never do to thier satisfaction, I would rather see the game grow in new creative ways.  So I applaude you in making a move towards improving the content without ignoring the playability.<P>In another post you said that EQ would be around as long as the subscriber base could support it.  That is common business sense.  But you know and I  know that you must begin to change the content of the game somewhat if the longevity of EQ is to be increased.  You have new products in the works which will create competition for EQ.  When you release those new games you will lose alot of EQ'ers to the new games.  Solidifying EQ's central core is good as long as you keep the creative side growing in the area of quests and other aspects.<P>Hmmm, this response has started me thinking of a few other things in a business line of thought.  Are you moving your most experienced programming staff to the new products you are designing?<P>Sony is your partner and they host the servers.  Will I get a reduced monthly charge if I subscribe to both EQ and the new games?  Is my $9.95 only good for EQ, or will it pay for playing on Sony servers and all their hosted games?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>All I ask is that you make sure an item is FIXED before it is frozen.<P>If you are going to allow more than 1500 people on a server, for example, the hybrid exp curve is NOT fixed as a hybrid is NOT stronger than EITHER class and the versatility is not needed because there are plenty of parents to go around.<P>you do not have to make do with a paladin because there are plaenty off warriors and/or clerics about who do the job MUCH better.<BR>Shadowknight, of would you rather have a Warrior...<BR>A bard cannot replace a rogue at ANY level...you gave them the skill rogues are needed for too late for the skill caps placed on them.  If you had given them pick locks at 5 with the current skill cap, it would make since....almost as good as a rogue, but fades slowly out of usefulness as the locks exceed the musicians abilities.  Instead, Bards get pick locks after level 30 and can only pick locks in Befallen?????  Tthey sure do not replace what an enchanter can do at any level unless your level 60 group is camping orc pawns and moss snakes....and not even then really.<BR>Ranger...or druid/warrior....evacs and heals or..<P>Now I have SEEN the versatility of a hybrid pay off big time...348 people online, and you are looking for anyone that can heal..."two casters looking for healer...ANYONE...even a ranger with high bind wound skill!"  I've seen it....done it...<BR>But with 1800 people online, it is too easy to find the parent classes....the specialits at what you need.  Hybrids AREN'T as good as EITHER of their parent classes even when you take into consideration their other abilities.  I watched a 50 warrior take down a 50 SK 5 for 5 with similar gear (and not even Kunark).  That simply isn't even...they weren't even close fights.  <P>I did not mean to make this a  'save the hybrids' post, but I wanted to show you what I meant.  Hybrids pay a huge exp penalty for something that may look good on the test server, but isn't on the play servers...especially on the really crowded ones.<P>Leirra Wayfarrer </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Abashi,<P>Don't you dare start on the issues with hybrid!!!!<P>I never get overtly angry but that is a bit much.  You guys have done nothing but mess things up for the hybrids, and specifically the rangers.<P>You guys aren't listening!!!!!!!<P>That is why people say it sucks.<P>You people seem to think that you have the answers when you create stop-gap measures.  Stop-gap mesures suck.<P>Screaming Terror Sucks.  It is a stupid 16 second stun.  If it is used for anything else it is a waste because the root spell does the same thing only better.  No to mention, you have nerfed the class so badly they've been nerfed into grouping.  This makes ST almost worthless.<P>Sure there are some purposes, but they don't hold the value that you guys seem to put on them.  Why?  Because we play the game.  We are the judges.  If we say they suck, then they suck.<P>ST was never lauded as being a great enhancement.  You fail to bring up the fact that the necro was nerfed in a major way and you put that in to make them more group friendly.<P>This attitude is what gets you so condemned.  You try to put a spin on something when the honest truth would be better.<P>I only give ST as an example.  You have put too little into the game and expected us, the paying customer to give too much in return.  The trade-offs aren't balanced.<P>Next you'll say that double damage on the bow for post 50 rangers is a great enhancement.  It isn't, for all the reasons we have been stating for the past 2-3 months.  These issues still exist.  The ranger defensive issues still exist.<P>How do you think we feel when you focus on things that you would like your ass kissed for instead of saying that you recognize problems and you are fixing them and telling us what you have planned.<P>Right now you want us to pay more for a product, Velious, to create some balance in the hybrid classes, yet the other classes, such as the magician, druid, cleric, and enchanter are fine now and don't have to pay this extra price to get closer to balance.<P>We told you that it was unfair to expect the ranger class to pay for Kunark to get closer to balance and now we are telling you that it is unfair to have the hybrids/rangers pay extra to get closer to balance with Velious.  This is just plain wrong and hundreds/thousands of rangers have said this to your face.<P>That is why you are getting the "this sucks" attitude.  You haven't listened and you create too many minor fixes that aren't balanced in the trade-off department.  Get real.  Fix the core problems instead of creating an expansion, fix the real issues with the classes, get into a focus group with your customers and ask what they think will make the game and classes balanced.  Do this as we have told you to do a hundred times over.  INVEST VERANT'S TIME IN A FOCUS GROUP BEFORE YOU PISS EVERYONE OFF.<P>And most of all, stop accusing people of things.  If you can't deal with them then keep it quiet because you are making people made with your abrasive style of responding.  You aren't the mother, you aren't the father, you are the company providing the service to these people.  Learn to deal with that.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Qwinn:  You make some lucent points, however I think you and I disagree as to the basis of the frustration that most players feel towards Verant.<P>I think that a lot of the frustration is fairly simple.  People are spending LOTS of time at a pursuit that is fairly rigidly designed by someone other than themselves.  That pursuit is certainly quite enjoyable as it is, but most people like to be have the creative freedom to inject some of themselves into their pursuit.  Certainly lots of people accomplish this by Roleplaying, etc, however I don't think it can be disputed that it is the random reward system of loot and exp that drives the majority of people to continue playing Everquest.  As such, I at least feel frustrated at times that I have to play Verant's way, and not my way.  That doesnt mean that I have any intention of ceasing to play.<P>Personally, I think that Verant does a very good job of listening to its customer base.  I think however its interation with that customer base could be better, especially with new content.  Yes Verant listens to customer suggestions, and often implements those suggestions in one form or another.  What is lacking is the tying together of the idea and the end product.  Would it be impossible for VI to put together a page that lists what they are currently working on, what the ETA is, and who's idea (if it came from the boards, etc) it was?   The biggest thing of course would be to keep it up to date, and to keep completed tasks archived as well.  Come to think of it, this would work well for bugs as well as new suggestions.  Give us a place to go to see the status of items instead of scrolling through hundereds of fleeting messages.<P>Just some thoughts, I'd like to see discussion on the topic.<P>Thanks,<BR>Perk<P>All spelling mistakes are my own, and not those of my employer or the public school I attended.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Abashi said: (One of the improvements to classes was). "More harmtouch damage for shadowknights."<P>HT still is a pathetic Skill... 641 at lvl 52 does less than 10% damage to most mobs found in High level dungeons... The old Harmtouch standard would have done 521 damage at 52... Not A whole lot of difference. Either way the skill is no where near as powerful as it should be.<P>HT was clearly designed for game caped at around lvl 20. The power of HT drops dramatically as lvls increase.<P>LOH suffers similar casualties... LOH at low lvls could nearly complete heal any one with in 5 lvls... At 40 LOH no longer healed most warriors to full.. at 52 a LOH only restores 3 bubbles of health. <P>Another example. Look at the Ranger issues. For months VI claimed that rangers were fine and did not need any upgrades. Upon doing a simple test they discovered class did infact have some survivablity issues.<P>YET another example: Look at VI's rather blatent disreguard of monks and monk equipment issues. Why should monk planner armor, (read shiver back) be no greater than there mid level gear. No other meelee class is insulted in this manor. I choose the word insulted intentionally, for all other meelee classes were give alternate, if not superior armors in Kunark... YET MONKs were ignored. <P>Hybrids need to be seriously examined post 50. Monks need some form of kunark armor.<P>GLAUX 52 REAVER<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&lt;&lt;I would guess, and its just a guess, that 75% of the complains on this board are from players over lvl 50, the post 50 game is so aggravating, so slow, so time consuming it has people on edge&gt;&gt;<P>The big problem I see here is that people wanted to level as fast as they did from 1 to 50. VI doesn’t want that they want 50 to 60 to take forever. (Notice no lvl cap increase with the next expansion) Too many 60th lvl players = a lot of bored players and that = people leaving to seeing what else is out there. VI knows that EQ has a very large amount of power gamers they did it for one reason as far as I can see and that’s to slow everyone down. I watched my friend get from 1st to 50th in no time got bored as hell cuz it was 4 months before RoK came out stopped playing EQ till RoK did come out and he still isn’t 60th yet. But man does he play his heart out trying to get that 60. I also think this is why hybrids are having such a problem post 50 the 40% exp penalty PLUS the fact that VI has slowed down EXP greatly really makes it tuff on you guys and I feel for you. Hell my roommate plays a Pali and I tell him screw you log in your wizard I don’t feel like playing for 3 hours and getting a quarter of a bubble. I guess here is what I am trying to say I have played quite a few of the characters up to higher lvls and watched other play the ones that I didn’t up to higher lvls and what I found was this when I just played and had fun and didn’t worry about anything but having fun I couldn’t see a darn thing wrong with any class I played (well besides the fact that I couldn’t bind my warrior or my monk but that was a dead issue and why beat a dead horse) but when I suddenly needed to catch up and lvls became important to me suddenly the minor problems I saw became huge flaws.<P>To quote Dennis Miller<BR>That’s just my opinion I could be wrong.<P>P.S. I don’t think VI will fix the hybrid EXP penalty it almost assures that getting from 50 to 60 will be a crawl.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Because Screaming Terror is basically a 10 second stun, but breaks if the mob is hit... er, actually i guess you COULD look at it as a mez, but lasts only 10 seconds.  Reason I use the STUN analogy is if i cast Screaming Terror on myself, I get the message that I am stunned (for 10 seconds).<P>SO, i guess this comes down to.. IS Screaming Terror working as intended?

</FONT><HR>Gordon--<P>I can answer your questions and problems. (at least to some point) but first off i would like to say that EQ is an amazing game. It has FAR surpassed my second favorite game. The dept of the detail, emersion, AI, interaction and general brilliance is stunning and thats why many many many people still play it.<P>I also im one of the people that "slams EQ" from time to time. I can explain, at least to me, why people constantly slam EQ.<P>1)EQ is so good in peoples mind that even the small bugs, glitches or necessary nerfs are huge in comparison to other games.<BR>    ie. Diablo 2 has 90 good points and 20 bad.<BR>        Everquest has 700 good points and 60 bad.<BR>   This shows that the 60 bad points are 3x the      amount of D2 but EQ is a far superior game.<P>2)The Risk vs Reward (exp)is messed up a little. Why is it? I do think that business and its numbers have had a influence on the exp curve 50-60. When making the exp from 50-60 you didnt take into consideration "just" the customers.<P>3)The Risk vs Reward (item) <BR>"An extended narrative poem in elevated or dignified language, celebrating the feats of a legendary or traditional hero."-Websters<P>The epic and uber items are not that epic or uber. You would be hard pressed to find ANY epic weapon that "celebrates the feats of a hero". What does +10 intel do and +5/+10 to all resistances? The people that have epic items dont care about the intel(wisdom or whatever) or the resistances. (they are ok but thats it) When you think of an epic hero do you see him wielding a ducky wand w/ a usless effect? Some hero he is. <BR>I think that Verant is to worried about "balance" that even epic items have taken a nerf. THE EPIC ITEMS should be at the very least USEFUL and if we are lucky.. EPIC!<BR>Epic items are items that only a hand full of people in each class will have so why not back off the already overused nerf stick and give something epic. 300,000 users and maybe 100 epic weapons on each server at the MOST in a year from now. They will never have the numbers to make EQ unbalancing.<P><BR>All in all people care a great deal about EQ and you should be flattered and thats why people react the wrong way. For the most part people will not make the best decesions in life and EQ. I know thats a sour way to look at things but i see this everday at work. =) So take the misplaced anger as a complement eventhough most of it does have some merrit in some shape or form.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Can you please tell me why you would ever respond to this post Abashi?<P>It is clear to me that you are right in the matter I'm not quite sure what comes out of all this pointless babbling.<P>If it is because you think everyone thinks Verant sucks, that's just not the case.  I think many if not most are completely pleased with EQ.  It gets better with the expansions.  I like the idea of freezing things, just come out with more immersive graphics, sounds and ways that players can interact in quests etc..  People like myself who are pleased with a product are not going to post on these boards.  So relax and feel good about what Verant has accomplished (and ignore posts from people like this).<P>The last and only real problem I ever had with EQ was early on when servers went down for strange reasons (many times).  But I have not seen those problems in ages.  I also think servers coming down should be annouced a week or more ahead of time if possible and that you should stick to that date.<P>Regards,<BR>Donvanlot</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Gordon-<P>You say that following Velious you will begin to <BR>"freeze" parts of EQ. You also say that parts of the game will always change. I'd like to ask whether the following issue is going to be looked at:<P>What about the very fundamental problem of hybrids stealing xp from groups? Note that THIS IS NOT ASKING FOR THE XP PENALTY TO GO AWAY. It is only asking for hybrids to PAY THEIR OWN XP PENALTY INSTEAD OF BURDENING THE GROUP WITH IT.<P>I've been pushing this issue for 6 months, and it's never been acknowledged by Verant. Verant has stated that they will not change the xp penalty, but they have never addressed the issue of group xp distribution. The fix that is being asked for (if you've missed the many threads about it) is asking for group xp to be divided by level instead of by total  xp. This means that hybrids pay their own xp penalty.<P>This is the only part of EQ that I think truly "sucks". It's a big, big design flaw and causes a _lot_ of tension, especially at higher levels. Can verant please look into this problem?<P>Don't know if I'm being correct in bringing this up in this thread. Normally I would make another thread but I wanted to directly reply to Gordon's saying that certain things will be frozen. Since this issue keeps accidentally getting confused with hybrid xp penalties, I don't want this to accidentally get frozen too - it would be a tragedy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is a game and the developers of that game need to make sure that the game does not get corrupted.  This is not an ordinary game like Quake or Baldur's Gate where players can finish the game or be a supreme being, it doesn't matter if a player is a god in quake because it is not a persistent game.  There can be the "best" in non-persistent games however when there is a "best", all the other players can't be one.  Why should one player get to be the "best" and the other players, who has invested the same amount not be able to?  They should not, all players should have different strengths and weaknesses.  The developer has to try to make sure that no one players gets overpowered because then the world would no longer function.  For example if every person was the President of the United States, then who would cook, farm, build, sow, etc.  If a truly epic weapon was available then a player with it could slay anything then every player would want it and should deserve to get that epic weapon since they invested the same resources as the other players.  When every player gets the epic weapon then it would no longer be an epic weapon but a average weapon and then players would want a truly truly epic weapon.  The now average weapon would already kill everything so they would have to add stronger monsters or increase the strength of the current monsters, then new players with the old epic weapon would not be able to play anymore.  Then the other players would complain that it's not fair that they invest the same and there average epic weapon doesn't let them kill a GOD, like a GOD is meant to be killed?<BR>A developer wants the best for their customers and will go out of their way for their customers.  The customers may not always understand everything that is going as well as the developer.  The customers have to trust what the developer is doing because it is in the best interest of the customer.  But without the developer's experience/knowledge the customer may have a hard time understanding that is it in the best interest of the product.  The developers can be wrong and sometimes it takes the customer to point it out.  However sometimes a developer tries to hard to satisfy the customer when it may not be in the customers best interest (however the customer believes it is).  This can lead to the customers wanting more and more and if the developer doesn't comply the customer begins to complain more and more.  So then the developer caves in and give the customer more of what the customer believes is in their best interest even though the developer believes otherwise.  This is a never ending cycle until the product fails and then who is to blame but the developer, after it was them that gave the customers what they wanted to make them happy when they knew in the long run it would not be in their best interest and no longer make them happy.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The question at hand seems to be, "Should Verant be required to post only accurate information in their spdat file?"<P>Note that the file is not named "readme.txt" nor does any of the game's manuals state anything to the effect of "for more information on ____, please parse your spdat file."<P>This file is only for properly informing the client software with what to do (such as display what anims, graphics, spell book info, etc) with further / modifying information from the server.<P>Verant has always frowned on spoilers.

</FONT><HR>Abashi,<P>Verant has created this ever evolving game, to think that the classes are balanced once and for all is very closeminded.  Obviously it takes a lot of effort to try to balance this 'ever evolving' game, but if u quit working on problems created by the very philosophy of the game, it will go to pot.  Obviously you are frustrated with the class balance issues but don't use excuses like 'i have seen complaints this week about every class', I have read these boards for a long time and there is always and indication of a problem when MANY people from MANY classes agree that there is.<P>Why not do some in game surveys to answer class balance problems?  This has been done for other things in the past, and I have suggested it several times.  See the truth in what I am saying here, please don't respond with a global comment such as some that u used in this post.  There are balance issues with classes and major ones at that, particularly with hybrids.  <P>Simple solution that Verant refuses to try.  Do some surveys regarding class need and contributions to groups.  It would be extremely easy to find out which classes that the players believed to be the most useful.  300,000 players surveyed will give an accurate picture im sure.<P>Heck, it took you a year before the original version of the classes was even close to being balanced.  Why do you think that the classes with Kunark are perfectly balanced after the innitial release.  Hybrids increases in taunt, dodge, bash or whatever are not even worth the letters used to say u did it compared with the problems that they have.  <P>You owe it to your paying customers to address these issues.  I do not have 110 days to get another character back up to where my current character is.  57 paly.  I don't want to fight as good as a monk or warrior or be better than any particular class, I just want to contribute to a group in all of the major aspects of the game and i don't because your hybrids need improvements.<P>Anyway, if your so frustrated with these posts that you can't even represent us to Verant with valid concerns, why bother? <P>Where are the descriptions of what tests have been done to show how hybrids are where they should be?  Citing a vague philosophy every time a good suggestion comes up to fix the issue is frustrating and insulting.  It is obvious to all of us that there have been no extensive testing for the contributions of a hybrid. If there were we know what the results would be. <P>I challenge you to explain in detail the extensive in game tests that Verant has done to demonstrate the need for hybrids.  I challenge you to do a couple of surveys rating 'need' for all of the classes. <P>Anyone that critically reads the posts can easily see the difference between the recent posts about classes.  The shaman hater post was ridiculous.  The monk hater post was a step up but definitely lacked the content and suggestions of the hybrid posts that have been going on.  If you cannot see the difference, again, do the in game surveys.<P>Heck yes we are frustrated and can't move on to more 'productive' topics about EQ, Verant won't let us.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>'freezing' any aspect of a huge, complex system, when other parts of it will go on changing, and expecting that this will not cause huge problems, is a pretty self-evidently dumb idea. I don't know where the staff that worked on the game for the last two years went, but I can't imagine that they haven't cottoned onto the basic truth that the reason the system needs constant tweaking is that any change can have large and unforseen consequences in seemingly only distantly-related areas. It's not the users causing these problems, it's the combination of design changes having huge and unforseen effects on other areas of the game, lack of imagination, resistance to user feedback, and the worst sustained job of customer contact I've ever seen anyone get paid folding money for in my entire adult life. As I see no evidence of that knowledge (and I'm not at all surprised I see no evidence) in Gordon's post, I can only assume they're no longer working on the game.<P>This is not a solution; this is handwashing. EQ was a testbed, (you thought it was otherwise?) and has served it's purpose.<P>My primary consolation in all this is that the testers have come away with the conclusion that they did a lot of stuff right, when in fact all the did right was be first.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Example of what I am talking about.<P>This is the typical structure of an ideal Sebilis, Chardok or Hole or HS group.  I think everyone would agree on the 'must' rated classes.  Most would agreeon the 'preferred classes' and then it may get a bit subjective after that but hybrids would ALWAYS be last on the list.  DO A SURVEY, post the results.  Do EXTENSIVE in game testing and post the results.

Absolutely no special contributions to any meaningful group as noted above.<P>Paladins = fair AC but the worst offensive power for any tank.  Lay hands is trivial in importance in any setting.  I might use it once every 12 hours in a group setting in these places in a useful manner.  Buffs useless, heals almost useless. Only redeeming thing about paladins is that they can stun, and this is useless for any big raids.<P>SK's = fair AC, decent offense, no special abilities that helps a group.<P>Any survey that would be done in a proper manner would show results very similar to these.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Time and Time again I've read these long posts about what Verant could do to accommodate a particular player's whim. I'd think by now people would get it through their skulls that Verant has made a distinct product, one which fundamentally requires cooperation in the game, and making the best of whatever race/class you choose. That's not going to change, and what people should really be considering is "Do I really want to devote my time to a game where I have to cooperate and make the best of the race/class I chose." The main angst here is the lack of any real competition on the market right now, UO isn't 3D, Asheron's Call is just plain lame (yes I've played it) the only product out there that's really scratching the player's itch is Everquest. There's obviously a demand for MMORPGs, and it'll be sometime before there is a MMORPG for every type of player out there. So we congregate here until that time where a company releases a product some of us can totally agree with. I personally have been playing this game almost since it came out, and in that time my opinion of Everquest has shifted dramatically. It was only after surveying it's competition did I come to understand Verant's "Vision", and how faithfull they've worked to uphold that. I'm really waiting for a MMORPG who's focus is squarely on Role Playing and character development and not on keeping the power gamers happy with new toys/quests/skillz. One where power is the accumulation of real experience and the completion of long and involved quests, instead of what my character wears or how long he's spent camping and killing 1 spawn over and over again. I'd like a world where I could stand on my own against legions of foul beasts, but could also benefit from a large party to take down rare and much larger prey. In my Fantasy I'm capable of very great things, and people would hear of my deeds and celebrate them. The Gods would take an active role in everyday life, aiding their most favored disciples instead of just showing up 3 hours after being "petitioned" (in my game it would be called praying) some rude individual who's not really interested in playing in character, hearing my complaint or resolving the issue. Just telling me there's nothing they can do, nothing they will do and disappearing before I can look at their ultra-rare gear I'm more than certain they didn't earn. Anyways, until that game comes out, I'll play Everquest the way I like to play it, spending more time talking with friends, starting new characters and role playing the Gothic Dark Elf Vampire I've worked so hard on. There's really not much else out there right now.<P>Jubellum Vlos`Colbauth<BR>Tunare Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Extremely good post Jubellum, too bad it will be ignored by almost everybody.<P>EQ is what it is, and can't re-shape itself to match everyone's idea of the perfect game.  I do not want multiple clone games of the same "uber idea," I want variety and the ability to decide which game is most suited for my tastes.<P>If anything, EQ's popularity has worked against it, since it has drawn so many people who, had there been suitable alternative, may have chosen a different game.  <P>I'm not repeating the "as soon as game X comes out EQ will die" line.  What I mean is that there has to be a sizable portion of the EQ player base who play only because EQ is the closest of the big three (UO, EQ, AC) to their ideal game.  If a game comes out that is closer to their ideal, they'll switch in a heartbeat.<P>I'm sure Verant knows this and realized it long ago, along with the old adage about not being able to please everyone all of the time, blah blah blah, I'm sure you've heard it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok...well this is my first post be gentle =)<P>Ive been playeng EQ for quite some time now and notced alot of people just complainiing over and over again. The game is fun..everyone agree? good...Now there are no fundamentally HUGE problems with the game and im sure the smaller ones will be fixed in time, you have to consider Verant is a large company but even they are human..yes thats right behind the monolithic name of Verant there are people like you and me running it, frightening I know but hear me out.<BR> Noone is perfect Verant makes mistakes sometimes and im sure the mistakes they have made have been pointed out by us the players. Verant has been working on a BIG PICTURE thing for quite some time now and maybe some of us are suffering from a case of myopia...They have a vision they are trying to establish and I believe are doing well, if they nerf something about a character class im sure they have good reason. I dont believe they would do something so stupid as to change a class to the point where they cannot be played anymore. it would only serve to destroy a customer base that they have been working to keep and are always working to keep pleased. If something goes wrong in our eyes im sure its just a part of a much larger plan to strengthen gameplay in the future. We have the right to state what we think may be incorrect and what we think sucks but if you analyze the class you are playing it is strengthening them in one way possibly weakining them in another but this only serves for better group effort. I see it in the way of Ill take X away from (Class) and give them Y...now if they group Y should be more effective and so on.<P>I may have just ramled into nothingness but I figure this is a general disscussion forum and thats kinda general =) That wasnt targeted to anyone its just merely something I felt like sharing with all.<P>-Arel Spellfyre</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"It seems that unless something is obviously overpowering, that is the first response to nearly anything that we put in. We put in Evade for the rogues and got a "this sucks". We put in the lure series for Wizards and got a "this sucks". Both of these despite the fact that these are now well known to be good features. That's just TWO things that were put in, met immediately with "this sucks", which were later found to be very useful."<P>That statement, as with many of your statements, is a gross generaliszation and borders on being insulting.  Robert is a very concerned customer that has some justifiable reasons to complain.  He may not be expressing himself in the best possible way, but some people crack after being neglected for so long.<P>In almost every post you comment on the most negative aspect which you find is the easiest to rip apart.  When was the last time you answered a post in detail and not just cover token aspects of it?<P>Of the proposed Shaman spells to be added the Shamans generally acknowledge and even requested spells such as poison and disease based DDs, bear form and bear pets, etc.  Its good to see our constant moaning has at least had some positive influence, even if it doesnt please every Shaman, that will never occur.<P>"I'm absolutely not saying that these boards don't bring valid issues to light from time to time, but unfortunately those valid issues are often hid by layer upon layer of complaints about everything under the sun."<P>You know why this forum is plagued with venemous complaints?  It is because of the way customers and this product are treated.  You set the rules, you have planted the seeds, now you reap the reward like it or not.<P>How many well presented Shamanic threads expressing concerns were simply ignored.  Not even a "Read your post and will give it some thought."<P>Why do people like Robert have to go postal before they are listened to?  He hasnt brought up any issues which havent been brought up many times before.  Why do you reply to his rants and not the previous posts?<P>The Shaman community has been a relatively calm and peaceful one.  They have put their faith and trust in VI that they will do the right thing and monitor each and every class and ensure they are all balanced without needing to come here all guns blazing.  That trust has not been rewarded.<P>The reality is you tend to those that scream the loudest and thus the Shaman community has been left in the dark for a long time.  This forum is always drenched with complaints from wizards, hybrids and bards since the dawn of EQ.  After 18 monts of non-stop complaining Warriors and Rogues have run off laughing.  They wanted to have minor issues address and they were turned into uber classes.<P>Exreme negative feedback from other classes resulted in Torpor and Avatar being nerfed.  These are our pinnacle spells?  Caster spells sell for thousands of platinum yet people cant even give our spells away.  I'm told to take them because they are taking up valuable bank space, but I tell my friends to sell the spells to vendors, they are that pitiful.<P>Shamans are relatively versatile.  Due to that they do not shine in any one area such as a cleric.  The Shaman class was one of the few designed to be able to solo, and solo well.  For some incomprehensible reason VI is determined to classify soloing as being evil and undesireable.  <P>Why?  Why slap those classes in the face?  As long as soloing is slower and less rewarding than grouping then you will have a majority of people grouping.  If nobody can solo from level 1 to level 60 realistically then where is that versatility?  I hate soloing, its boring and antisocial, but I dont mind if people wish to solo.  You have to cater for everyone, not just the powergamers.<P>If your going to force people kicking and screaming into constant grouping then why not present everyone with realistic grouping skills and spells, not the odd token spell.<P>&gt;It's gotten to the point that often the first <BR>&gt;indication of a problem is when there is an <BR>&gt;issue or facet of the game that no one complains <BR>&gt;about. I've read "Verant hates our class" posts <BR>&gt;by virtually every class in the past week or so, <BR>&gt;in varying degrees. Are all of these <BR>&gt;issues "valid"? "<P>People will say whatever they need to say to draw your attention to their posts.  The fact that you only reply to the venemous rants just fuels that fire.<P>You do not engage into any meaningful discussion with the playerbase about classes.  I dont want figures, I want an ideology, I want communication.  But VI chooses not to, so people rant.<P>One thing is certain, since the expansion the nature of the game has change and the nature of many classes has changed.  Its not that the classes suck or have always sucked but the nature of the classes has altered dramatically in many cases.  Its what has many people upset.<P>It should be the intention of VI to make every class enjoyable to play and desired by the community.  Its common knowledge people dont ask for a Shaman like they do Enchanters, Clerics or Wizards.  Why is that?  In essesnce it boils down to poor design.<P>These are the classes with group issues, not in any particular order:<P>Paladin - Tanking ability is poor, damage output is poor and spells do not even come close to making up for no disciplines.<P>Shadow Knights - See Paladin.  Damage output a little better.<P>Ranger - Paper thin armour.  Either they must opt to cripple their damage output or become mana sponges.  Either way they are useless.<P>Bard - Handy songs but nothing that Enchanters cant do considerably better (except heal).  Mana sponges as everything they do is mega taunt.<P>Necromancer - Awesome soloing ability but the ability to solo has been butchered.<P>Magician - See Necromancer re soloing.  Less of an impact than necros since DDs are still group friendly unlike dots.  Bolt spells problematic.  Pet +Excellent DD +Malise line = excellent group contribution.<P>Druid - See necro re soloing. Rely on dots and outdoor spells.  Good DDs, Damage shields and Succor make them desireable in groups as nuker/backup healer/evaccer if no wizard.<P>Shaman - See necro re soloing.  Stat buffing undesireable.  Dots undesireable.  Melee buffing inferior to Enchanter, buffs inferior to Enchanter, Magician have same resistance debuff, Melee debuff useless.  Expensive ineffective pets. Least desireable priest class.  Most inefficient damage dealer in groups.<P>Does diversification equal less desireability in group situations?  This is VI's only justification for Shaman having such a poor desireability in groups.<P>The only other class that is as versatile to my knowledge is the Enchanter.  I've been going through my spell lists of both my enchanter and my shaman and as far as versatility goes I record 35 lines/types of spells the shaman has to 46 that the enchanter has.  I can list them if you like since I wrote them down.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>The Shaman has nothing which is unique, the enchanter has many unique lines.  The enchanter is a powerful soloing class.  It is the fact that Shaman have nothing unique and desireable which is why they are not wanted in groups.  An Enchanter can pretty much do anything the Shaman can except heal, and a cleric is vital in groups anyway.<P>This is where the game is breaking down.  You have not made all classes viable.  A major error.  It is why so many players are irrate.<P>&gt;Here's the deal. Following Velious we will begin <BR>&gt;to freeze aspects of the game. We will become as <BR>&gt;firm on various issues as we have been on <BR>&gt;subjects such as melee binding or experience <BR>&gt;curves. Things that aren't related to content <BR>&gt;will be closed down. First skills and their <BR>&gt;caps, stats, etc, followed by spells from the <BR>&gt;bottom up. We'll then start reviewing some of <BR>&gt;the rarer items as well as quest rewards. Within <BR>&gt;a month or two we'll get to the point that we'll <BR>&gt;be focusing solely on content-related issues <BR>&gt;such as implementing new quests, fixing old <BR>&gt;ones, and more or less moving forward all of the <BR>&gt;time."<P>Believe it or not Gordon, its in your best interest to listen to the complaints.  Why do I still play EQ?  Well, the system is functional and it entertains me.  I dont care if class X is better than class Y as long as class X has a reason to keep playing.<P>I see enough things of interest to warrant playing my druid and my enchanter further, but I just cant see a reason to keep playing the Shaman.<P>It doesnt bother me, if you butcher the Shaman class I'll play my other characters.  Other people arent so forgiving.  My gut feeling is that you dont want 75% of the EQ population playing just Enchanters, Clerics and Warriors though.<P>The only reason I keep coming back is because of the guilds I am in.  I get 85% of my entertainment from interacting with people and 15% from the game.  I sit there and laugh because if I was a Days of Our Lives script writer I'd be making a fortune ripping off guild dramas.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>I really like to see the Shaman class have purpose, because they are fun and versatile.  Just because they have been silent doesnt mean they like the slop that was dished up to them in Kunark.<P>Considering what was given to other classes you will be getting the next generation of players comparing the total package.  It has to compare.<P>Is it burnout?  I doubt it.  I feel the dissapointment and I generally only play on weekends and have gone for months without playing.<P>I want to play my Shaman, but its a waste of time.  I am not needed in groups and my peers level 5x faster in dungeons.  Outdoor mob respawn rates were nerfed, giant loot was nerfed... I sometimes wonder if I will look up into the sky only to see a large foot just step on me.<P>Tell me Gordon, why should we bother?  Will a handful of poison DDs or the ability to turn into a bear outdoors replace what has been lost?  Honestly, you think Shamans are as balanced, desireable and as versatile as an Enchanter?<P>I love my Enchanter, but he doesnt have the same appeal for me to play.  I really dont have the passion to raise another caster to the same levels.  Who knows, he might be crippled in 12 months like Shaman were.<P>You changed the nature of the Shaman class and its why they are so rare nowdays.  They are unhappy with what has happened.  Compare the numbers of 50+ shamans to those of other classes.  For such a powerful solo class is it logical that they are so undesired?<P>I dont expect an answer to this, because I am not ranting and raving and the sensible posts are always ignored.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/030379-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/030379.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/030379-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/030379-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=030379&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=030379&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
