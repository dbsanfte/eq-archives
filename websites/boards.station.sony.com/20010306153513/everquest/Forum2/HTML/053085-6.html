</FONT><HR>Is there a way to implement quest that can permantly up your stats? Not somthing that can be done over and over again but a one time only quest that would allow you to permantly gain 10 strength or 10% haste. Monks are extremly dependant on equipment now for their damage output i.e. haste items and weapons and our planer gear is very lacking. I have a 54 monk and I hate having to think that the only choice I have to make him better than he is now is to camp a better peice of equipment. Questing for a new skill or stat would be a refreshing change. This idea could work for all the other classes too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, saw this in your post:<P>"The question here is, are monks supposed to do more damage than warriors and less than rogues. I don't know, really."<P>I know you said you havn't done any investigation into the class issues but Abashi has stated time-after-time that in Verant's 'VISION' the monk is the best toe-to-toe fighter in the game. Granted a rogue in their optimum position (behind the mob) is going to do the most damage by far (though this isn't the issue).<P>Monks don't do enough damage to damage taking. If monk are dealing barely 10% more damage than warriors, yet require over 3 times the mana to keep alive, who are you going to choose to group with?<P>And then you have people saying 'Well, you're the best puller in the game', yet they fail to realize that we're required to pull in maybe only 2 or 3 zones in the entire game (Chardok, Hate and maybe The Hole). Most other zones (Sebilis, Karnors, CoM etc...) are usually pulled by the highest level person in the group/raid and places like Fear and PoG we aren't even wanted to pull. This along with the fact that Verant have continued to say that feign pulling was never intended to be possible (I'm not even going to mention the problems with the newer mobs in Velious).<P>Now no monk in his right mind would want FD to be nerfed AGAIN to gain damage output, but we shouldn't have to. If we didn't have this skill we'ed be dead very very quickly. And giving us something like evade is pointless, it'd turn us into rogues without a backstab.<P>I doubt we'll see a beneficial change to feign death, but some of the suggestions I've seen for damage output are quite good. The flying kick skill and its thunderous kick descipline need serious looking into. Our highest special attack landing 3s and the discipline landing 24s is just stupid. The minimum/level is a nice idea, or the chance to land the older skills in a flurry-of-blows type effect would add some variety as well as damage.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Ok I've thought about this a bit and have a few suggestions to make... You might not like them all but here goes...<P>1 - Seperate timers for 'feet' special attacks (kick, round kick, flying kick) and 'hand' special attacks (tiger claw, eagle strike, dragon punch). This will up the damage output decently by monks and make those lower level skills useful once again (well maybe only dragon punch). Is it too terribly unbalanced to add an extra 8-10 damage a round at low levels?<P>2 - Flying Kick should have a slight STUN effect associated with it like a warrior BASH does (0 second stun maybe 1 second). I mean if you had someone jump up and kick you in the chest wouldnt you get the wind knocked out of you  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> This is a level 30 (or was it 35) ability so make it a bit more useful than just pure damage output.<P>3 - Monk Fists should deal critical hits. You gave warriors criticals with everything (as right they should), rangers with bows (masters of archery seems fitting) and rogues with throwing weapons (sneaky types, already get a big damage ability in close combat). Hows about giving us critical hits with our fists this would be a nice balance as right now fists have almost no bonuses over high end weapons. Again some people are asking for criticals on thrown weapons this doesnt fit with monks.<P>4 - Defense could be improved slightly, I notice that I already dodge/block/riposte/miss a good deal of attacks that come my way but when they do land they hit HARD (I'm talking like 120 out of 1.4k hp). Our lack of armor makes up for this a bit. Such is the life of a monk...<P>5 - Someone said that abilities going off from higher level skills. I think this is a great idea that there is a small chance you will Flying Kick, Dragon Punch, Eagle Strike, Tiger Strike, Round Kick and Normal kick all in one attack. I just shudder to think of the agro this type of thing might cause tho considering our fast swinging fists/weapons are already giving their share of agro. Maybe a combination of this and #1. Flying Kick and Dragon Punch are on seperate timers but each timer has its own small chance of automatically firing off the lesser version of attacks (Flying Kick could trigger Round Kick and that could trigger Kick while Dragon Punch could trigger Eagle Strike and that could trigger Tiger Claw).<P>6 - Make off-hand do as much damage as primary hand but *ONLY* with fists. Moss Covered Twig and other off hand weapons would not get a damage bonus this way.<P>7 - Theres a bug where mobs in melee range will get a free swing at you while you FD. If you dont FD at just the right time it gets this hit. This is what causes most to see through the FD, fix it so the hate list is wiped completely while FDed and this will more than likely be fixed.<P>8 - On the epic weapon being too easy... Think about the COST to buy those items also you might want to look at some other class epic quests *cough*rogues*cough* if your going to increase ours in difficulty<P>9 - Make FD work the way it did before, it cleared your agro completely. I'm heading towards the planes and I hear there is some code in the planes where if you FD more than 5 times it doesnt think your dead (but it can make you that way easy). If you look at FD as an evade type skill then please make it so we dont have to /q or /camp out so we can use our 'evade' again you dont ask a rogue to camp out after 5 backstabs or a wizard to camp out after 5 nukes or a druid to camp out after 5 SOWs.<P>10 - I really like the way you made our epic weapon change the DMG/DLY of our fists... PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make more weapons like this! Not just for monks (although the real good and best ones should be MONK only which our epic is) but for all classes so that hand to hand is not just a joke. Wouldnt it be great to see a warrior using their fists for once rather than big 2 hander of deth  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>11 - I know this isnt a MONK only concern but I want to know can you make particle effects on armor? If so how about an epic BP/robe for all classes huh huh?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Aight...lemme say what I agree with at least so you know what I've read...then I'll add my suggestions. =)<P>I agree:<BR>...with matching the 2 monk races, if they're not already balanced. Human monks and iksar monks have different ups and downs that, while an excellent attempt to balance the two (best example of balance currently available I daresay)in its current state (higher iksar natural AC and higher regen rate vs. higher human monk physical combat efficiency), I think it would be ideal to create something that ultimately would make a group want both races of monk. I dunno if I could elaborate more on that, might be splitting hairs.<P>...greater effectiveness of specials. For example, I'm just starting out, I've had Kick for a while, now I have Round Kick, and it does more damage than Kick (insert any skill upgrade here - Tiger Claw vs. Eagle Strike, Eagle vs., Dragon/Tail, etc.), even though my skill in Kick is capped for my level, and my Round Kick is still barely past 10, I can kick more butt with Round Kick. Being a monk, human or iksar, there seems (to me) to be NO reason why I shouldn't be able to do as much if not more damage with my last (and thoroughly more studied) special. If I've got Kick up to 100, and Round Kick up to 30, Round Kick should not do more damage than Kick. Think about it. If I'm facing a guy with nunchaku and he's got 150 in the skill, I really shouldn't be able to drop him with a rating of 10 in Firearms..ya know? He'd be on me and off me before I even thought to pull the trigger... That's obviously not an in-game example, but its the same analogy. Why should I deliver more damage with 20 in Tail Rake/Dragon Punch, than 130 in Round Kick? The point of this one is, make the early skills still or more effective in high levels. The higher level damage/skill enhancement is the same argument. I SHOULD be able to Fear a mob if it's a blue, and I perform an offensive  skill on it with anything, say, 100 points higher than it has in the same skill, it should run for the hills. If it doesn't have the skill at all, then the Fear would that much more effectivness. Fear, stun, charm, whatever. Just something. Even if it stood still and did the Babality dance it'd be more incentive.<P>...more effective mid-level equipment, or less altogether. I'm STILL wearing my cured silk at 28. Not that that isn't normal (and if its not then fill me in hehe =), just that I don't like having to look forward to ONLY Crescent, or ONLY shiverback...or that I can't reasonably earn myself something better before I reach 40. Monks in armor, in itself, is a joke. Monks don't wear armor. They wear robes. Why wouldn't the majority of the available armor for monks be in some kind of long holocaust-cloak type thing with a big gregorian hood? Don't get me wrong, I love my cured silk, and its saved my butt more than not having it, but I think at the very least, the monks should be included (more) in the very diverse selection of casterwear.<P>...which brings me to my suggestions. =)<P>***Give monks MEDITATE. I mean, that's what monks do. Meditate. Why wouldn't a monk be able to temporarily increase his/her regen during meditation? I mean, that's what monks do. Meditate. When they're not excercising, they...MEDITATE. Meditate would be a great addition to the human monk anyway, as it would allow them to match the natural iksar regen. Cmon....didn't you watch Kung Fu? =) In-game, meditation would enhance the regen rate of the monk using it, nothing more. This of course, albeit against the current Vision trend of sociability, would then make monks more soloable, but alternatively less reliant on healers in a group...thus making for a more efficient puller (the #1 current monk occupation).<P>***Make monks indifferent by nature to significant NPCs. This would probably never happen as it would most definitely be unbalancing as far as quests are concerned, but when was the last time you felt threatened by a wandering monk?? I can see a Tunare worshipper not liking me because I'm a Thulian, but there still should be some relieving factor due to the fact that I'm a monk, and as such not as prone to unprovoked attacks. In other words, less of a threat. The monks, human and iksar, are a patient and sedentary lot. A guy walkin' around in a robe and a bowl haircut should never make someone afraid off the bat. Maybe concerned for their children, but not afraid. =)<P>For what that's all worth, that's my contribution. =)<P>L - 28 Imonk & 21 Gnecro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;"Monks should have greater damage evasion skills than they currently have post 50. By this I mean Dodge, Block, Riposte, and maybe another. They are martial arts experts after all."&lt;<P>Well, this is something that I seem to have encountered with the shadow knight talk earlier. Some want offense, some want defense. Keep in mind that it is highly unlikely that getting both would be balanced. When compared to a warrior, a monk   will either be more offensive and less defensive, or the other way around. Being better at both isn't balanced.<P>I'll have to find out what the, um…, Vision ™ is for this class, and then we'll look at both offense and defense.<P>My understanding was that the balancing factor was the fact that monks don't have half the hp of a warrior, that means that if we are being hit there is no way for us to tank as effectively as a warrior/shadowknight/paladin who can use a cleric's healing ability to its full potential because of the hp that they have over us.  Also the fact that when we get hit, we get harder than these tank classes due to lack of damage mitigation means that lower total health of the monk leaves us laying on the ground, out of combat.<P>The thing is mobs want to hit monks, and they hit us hard and we don't have the hp to take the hits. <P>I think another problem is one you mentioned, with the having to look up the "vision" on monks.  I think thats the problem, no one knows what the "vision" for monks is, so monks get left out of balance.<P>From the start I always viewed monks as being defensive masters, sacrificing heavy armor for ability to dodge, this doesn't mean when we get hit we don't get hard, it just means that monks need to be the _BEST_ at avoiding being hit, since we "chose" not to wear armor.<P>You also will notice a flip flop in beliefs about damage because no one really knows, pre kunark, monks were labeled as master of melee, they did the most damage, with the exception of rogues post evade.  After kunark, monks continued to sort of hold this title, though analyzation came to realize that the best weapons availible to the general playerbase left monks wielding the same or like weapons to all other class, meaning they lost their distinction, except the fact that there were a few EXTREEMELY rare monk items that gave them the best advantage, so the in theory were still the masters of melee.  With velious, while not completely explored, common drop weapons useable by many non-monk classes and not the monk class and no simular improvement items for monks leaves monks actually lower on the damage scale than they were previously.<P>Mind you that the reason monks went to weapons is that their hands no longer compared damage wise to the best possible weapons as well as skill wise after kunark came out.<P>It boils down to, I think monks can be balanced with having superior defensive skills and damage dealing abilities because the design features being, monks can't afford to be hit given their lower hit points and their damage mitigation leaves them being hit for near max damage due to the fact that we don't have the damage mitigation ac and verant seems steadfast against changing this.  The final result is the best equiped monk will have roughly 200 less ac than the best equiped warrior a margin of about 15%, and at least 30% less hitpoints than the average warrior/true tank class.  <P>Monks aren't designed to be tanks, they are designed to avoid damage, not take it.  Given those balancing features they can reasonably be given significant increases to damage and damage avoidance.<P>In the end game, a monk won't be chosen for a group over a warrior if they don't do more damage than a warrior, because they don't tank as well and never will.  <P>Additionally, i will tell you the reason i get passed up for groups on a regular basis.  I don't have one ability that the tank classes have all had since level 1, taunt.  Monks aren't even asking for taunt as an ability, but flat out ask any caster and they will insist upon building a group around someone who can taunt as well as tank.  Sure i can outdamage a paladin or shadowknight but i can't get the mob off a wizard that just overnuked before he/she dies.  For this reason monks will always be stuck fighting for that 5th or 6th slot that isn't Tank, Cleric, Enchanter, Evac'er.  If monks don't bring something compelling, such as significant damage, then the groups will take a rogue or warrior or any class that can do significant damage.<P>Balance is having a compelling reason to invite a character beside that the person behind the character is a friend who made a poor choice in playing class.  <P>I also wanted to mention briefly the epic quest, since people have brought it up.  Its not suposed to be quick and easy, and i grant that.  However, it also should not be the most grueling tedius experience in existance.  I would say that almost every aspect of the monk epic quest is relatively balanced time required versus tedium except for one specific camp, that being Raster of lower guk. Someone said that they found Raster after spending 90 hours in his room, (in effect, staring at the wall, killing green monsters), now i will tell you that the truth of the matter is, this person got lucky, in general, the average camp time of Raster is more along the lines of 160 hours.  Consider for a moment how long that really is.  Compare that to an 8 hour work day that most people put in  every day, you realize that the lucky person who posted spent more than two weeks of time on that particular project.  The average person spends closer to four weeks on the project.  Not only that, but there are long waiting list for this camp, often 5-6 people wait in line to camp him.  There was a simular problem in Najena way back with a pair of boots that gave a Spirit of the Wolf type effect.  How come was it not acceptable back then and justified making a quest to spread the campers out, but it is acceptable for Raster? Yes there is a short-cut, if you have enough friends to bring down a mob that is higher than 60th level, and maybe that shouldn't be... but it is a lot less cruel to make someone spend the time making friends in the game to accomplish an epic task (killing a lvl 60+ mob) than to sit staring at a wall praying that after 160 hours of camping, when the mob finally shows up that you aren't KS'd by someone else.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I know I'm a little late in posting however I'll add my two cents in.<P>First off, Abashi has many times said that the vision of monks were kings of damage dealing, and, for a brief time we were and were content with that.  Not as tough as warriors. As tough, if not tougher than rogues.  However, our damage dealing potential was always higher than both.<P>With the upgrades to rogues their damage approached ours when in groups, but not while soloing.  Warriors were never as good as we were as far as damage output per unit time either.<P>Unfortunately it seems that by the time kunark was released, both rogues and warriors, who were both unpopular classes at one time, were far and above over compensated for their previous deficiencies.  Better weapons.  Better armor.  Better disciplines.  All to the point that their combat performance exceeded that of the monk by leaps and bounds.  <P>Now we are being told (or atleast infering your meaning by your responses) that our class has been redefined as being better than rogues but not as good as warriors as far as what our original class defining ability is concerned, that being damage output potential.  This is a concern to myself and I'm sure to many others, as I see the question being asked in many posts "What is our new role or class defining ability?"<P>The last issue has to do with equipment.  Every new item that is released that would improve our class has some drawback on it that deminishes us.  Usually that is unusually high weight or an exceptionally low AC.  Now we are seeing tradeskill items (black panther skin armor to be specific) with better overall stats and AC than our planes gear(an insult to say the least in many respects), further complicated by the fact that no human or iksar can train their skill high enough to make it themselves.  <P>Even the evolution of our class specific gear does not even compare nor come close to the same progression as that of other classes.  All other melee classes received armor in Kunark with considerable armor class increase and a right click effect.  Monks did not.  The progression from Plane of Hate/Fear armor to the armor found in Plane of Growth is as much as 30% increase in armor class, but the same cannot be said for the monk equivalent.  There is no need to go in to the weapons with considerably better delays than fists as I have seen others post concerning it.<P>Lastly, are the disciplines and class abilities.  Rogues received a discipline that will double a backstab of 500 damage to 1,000 damage or more, which can land twice in a single round.  We receive a thunderkick that consistantly hits for less damage than a regular fly kick with no associated special abilities (like stun, debuff, etc).  Warriors receive triple attack at level 60, mind you wielding weapons with better delay ratios than our fists, even with celestial fists.  <P>My suggestions for finding some middle ground are as follows:<P>1.  Do not change the class defining characteristic of monks, which is the king of damage dealing.  While I would concede it is too late to nerf warriors and rogues, giving monks triple attack, maybe even at some point before 60 will help keep them on top.<P>2.  Allow the cellestial fist effect to stack with other standard haste buffs, or make the haste effect permanent like that of rogues and rangers.<P>3.  Thunderkick discipline should at the very least be on par with the double damage back stab ability of rogues.  Not necessarily do as much, but atleast have a higher minimum base damage, double normal damage, and/or an associated proc.<P>4.  Additionally, fly kick should double attack as per the rogue ability to double backstab.<P>5.  All of our special attacks, or atleast some of them, should be able to use more than one per recycle time.  To be able to round kick and fly kick at the same attack round would not noticably increase our damage output but would instill a little meaning in having those skills.<P>6.  While I would not ask for monk items with rediculous damage delay ratios, I would say to slow down on the warrior and rogue stuff.  If you are to introduce new items for monks I would only ask that they follow the same progression as any other class.  Equal percentage increase in AC and equivalent increases in damage/delay to keep them above that of warrior/rogue.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello all!<P>I can't take time to read all the posts here, but I'm pretty sure nobody has spoken of some particularities of the Monks.<P>Monks are supposed to be Martial Artists.<P>And the main difference between two Martial Artists are their school of training.<P>I mean, some of the people here want the Monks to be more offensive, others want to be more defensive, with good suggestions.<P>So, I say, why not allow Monks to choose their "School". Some could take the Offensive way and others the Defensive one. The skills, disciplines, and caps would be different for each school (2 in fact, more would be too much). Some quests could be done only by one type of school.<P>And of course, the choice between Offensive/Defensive couldnt be changed, just like the religious choice.<P>I really dont know if this change is doable, but I think this could give more fun to the Monk class and allow them to act in different ways regarding their school.<P>Fann</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>/agree Zadkiel and Boki's monkly-business compilation. If you could only accept one opinion, this is it. Read it as it is the bible of monks.<P>Reason why monks are getting behind is because VI's dev team does not communicate so they constantly make changes to the game that unintentionally affect monks. Such as no new monk weapons in SoV or the effectiveness of FD while grouped and in SoV or the unbalanced distribution of expansion skills and armor sets to rog/war/mnk.<BR>And here we are wondering why we keep losing our power while VI claims that haven't, because they aren't aware of the changes (or lack of changes, example: new weapons) and so in their mind we are just as powerful as we were 2 expansions ago. I'm sorry but things have changed a lot, Rogues went from 50dps to 100dps in RoK, Warriors went from a good tank to the ONLY tank in RoK/SoV, and here monks are with the 2hp per tick regen while FD (give me a break!). On top of that less and less weapons made especially for us and still no armor in RoK and now armor in PoG of SoV that I won't even touch with a 10ft pole. If you look at monks being balanced in full PoG armor then please balance our offense in accordance!'<P>And please, no more shuriken critical types of suggestions. You can't balance a class with fluff. But most importantly FD must work when a monk makes the skill check.. Looking at FD after SoV its like Evade turned into Jolt, its quite laughable. <P>It is time to recreate the "Vision" for monks since the progression of the game has all but destroyed it. The monks are here waiting for you to make up your minds, do you or do you not support FD pulling, do you or do you not want us to be a melee machine, do you or do you not want monks to have a role in a group? As it stands now, monks are a peon fighter with no class defining specialty and it is up to you that our class role is made CLEAR to everyone.

</FONT><HR>Point #1: <BR>I believe the person who posted the "the epic is too easy" notion was actually refering to 3 points mainly but his communication skills didnt make this happen. I think his points were:<P>#1 - remove the RotLC from Qwinn and Zephyl<BR>Im all for this, not because Im jealous, but because you have powergamers killing the brothers and skipping probably the most frustrating and only "quest" part of the quest. Not to mention that I camped Qwinn WAAAYYY longer than I did Raster(believe it or not) and I would have definitely been pissed to finally see him pop after 5 or 6 days only to have some uber guild take him out before I could turn in my code and headband. They can keep the robe as drop in the game, but for crying out loud move it where there are REAL dangers and REAL consequences for killing the NPC. Maybe the guildmaster in Qeynos where there are several NPCs to help out and serious faction hits, currently, its just 1 NPC and no faction hits and that is just too easy.<P>#2 - RoWF can be multiquested<BR>I think the point he was driving for is to prevent a situation like this. <BR>a_cool_dude_monk tells uber guild 'someone just had me loot some pipe from the pawduster in Karnor's what's it for?'<BR>a_cool_dude_guildmate tells uber guild 'thats for the robe of the wistling fist quest, I have the pipe from chardok'<BR>a_cool_dude_guildmate tell guild 'lets go gank one of the brothers and get you a robe bro!'<BR>Voila!! Robe of the whistling fist in about an hour, too easy....<P>#3 - all the NPCs after RoWF are easy and not random<BR>Don't agree with this, the frustration for the RoWF is enough *cough* Raster *cough*<P>Im in agreement with removing or MOVING the RotLC from the brothers, but the rest seems about par for the other epics, the RotLC is the hardest part and its too easy and NO CONSEQUENCES to skip if you have an uber guild. At least make them KOS at one of the 3 guilds if not all.<P>Point #2:<BR>Epic needs an upgrade or fix, think this has been hammered to death but you can give a level 1 monk a CoF and 2 jade maces and be pretty darn close to the celestial fists(in theory), nuff said.<P>Point #3:<BR>I originally started playing a monk because I liked the idea of being competitive without uber equipment but that has changed, now I have to get uber weapons and gear to stay competitive. We need an upgrade to fists or some incentive to use H2H. Celestial fists is a step in the right direction but too rare and far away.<P>Point #4:<BR>The current frustration for monks is getting the highest AC without going over the weight limit. Its all about penalty and nothing about reward. How about giving an AC bonus if they get their weight under a certain amount?? For example:<P>over 14 wt: current AC penalty<BR>10-14 wt: no bonus, no penalty<BR>8-10 wt: 25ac bonus<BR>5-7 wt: 50ac bonus<BR>0-5 wt: 75ac bonus<P>Its just an idea but it would give people something to think about.<P>Knukles Ninefingers<BR>41st Monk - Ayonae Ro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Flying Kick needs to have its minimal damage looked into.  Its really not worth it to kick for a nice 65, then 3.  I mean, 3 dmg is worse then lvl 5 kick.  I have heard several ideas of 1/2 the level of the monk will be the minimal damage on your kick.  I think this is a very even, balanced way to give a minimal damage.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Let me start by saying I do not think the Monk class is unbalanced, but. <P>Many many times I have seen posts saying Monks are the masters of Melee Damage, but this just isnt true.<P>The only way I really see a way in us getting our title back is well by giving us an upgrade to Flying kick... Rogues start with Backstab at level 10. Monks go threw Kick,Round Kick, Tiger punch, Eagle Strike, Dragon Punch, and Flying kick. Now Flying kick is nice, but it just isnt good enough at 51+.<P>I have never played a Rogue, but ive seen pastes of Rogues backstabing for 700+ damage, and this skill recycles every 10 seconds, just like flying kick. Now a GOOD flying kick at 55+ might land for 140ish damage. I think my hardest is around 127.<P>Now, as long as our special ability only hits in the 100-150 range, we will never get our title back.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I just thought of another serious benefit to one of my previous suggestions about the monk weight/AC bonus.<P>The current frustration for monks is getting the highest AC without going over the weight limit. Its all about penalty and nothing about reward. How about giving an AC bonus if they get their weight under a certain amount?? For example:<P>over 14 wt: current AC penalty<BR>10-14 wt: no bonus, no penalty<BR>8-10 wt: 25ac bonus<BR>5-7 wt: 50ac bonus<BR>0-5 wt: 100ac bonus  &lt;--currently it very hard to stay this light with food and water and any gear so the bonus should be substantial<P>This would also make the cured silkd/crescent/shiver-back MUCH more desirable since it is very light in weight and could possibly solve 2 problems at once. Cured silk/crescent/Shiverback being inferior and monks being so equipment dependent. Would also make more monks look like monks rather than "druids".<P>Just some thoughts.<P>Knukles Ninefingers<BR>41st Monk - Ayonae Ro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Balancing Ikar/Human:<P>Yes, Iskar get an exp malus and yes they should be better than human monks because of this, but the difference is simply to big. Regen and Ultravision are a great bonus for Iskar monks (not talking about the nice forage and superior swimming abilities) and balance them for the exp malus (like troll/human warrior balance). The additional ac bonus is simply to much. Other iskar class combinations balance this with restrictions on armor (no plate armor). For iskar necros ac is not so importaint and iskar have a lower int to balance it. But monks? Well monks can not wear plate even if they are humans. So the iskar monks get the full ac bonus over monks and that is simply to much.<BR>Suggestions: Atk bonus for human monks (if you want to make iskar and human monks different) or ac bonus for human monks (if you want to make them equal).<P><BR>Balancing Rogue/Warrior/Monk:<P>From what i know vision on those 3 pure melee classes is<BR>rogue: best damage dealing, worst damage absorption.<BR>warrior: best damage absorption, worst damage dealing.<BR>monks: somewhere between.<P>While rogues and warriors since start of EQ got lots of enhancements in skills and equipment and now do their jobs great, monks do not. Skills are nearly identical now and common warrior weapons (jade mace, lamentation, wurmslayer) beat everything but the rarest monk weapons in damage output. Rogues get even better weapons. Armor is even worse. Kurnak comes out, warriors and rogues get several awesome armor sets, some with spelleffekts and great ac, some with great ac and stats. Monks have no spell effekts and still run around with gator pants from upper guk. Monk only armor set ac is the lowest of all, standard leather based items are to heavy to wear as a monk because of weight restrictions, so monks end up with wearing pure caster armor to get the ac they need (but lack on stat boni then).<P>So what do these classes post 50 offer to a group:<BR>Warriors: massive damage absorption, pre 55 ability to stun with slam/bash, post 55 ability to stun with EVERY kick (extremly importaint against all those gating and chealing mobs with high magic resistance), good damage output.<BR>Rogues: Lockpick, Sense/Disarm traps, scouting with sneak/hide, massive damage output, evade to safe clerics mana.<BR>Monks: Mend (saving the cleric a sup heal every 6 minutes), fd (they can cancel a bad pull, can not be used to "evade" because it does not wipe hatelist anymore), damage output slightly higher than warriors, but nearly no damage absorption abilities (no hitpoints, no taunt, no ac).<P>Solutions:<P>Upgrade to flying kick. In lvl 35 with short sword of ykesha beeing the best weapon this skill was nice. But with lvl 60 and weapons doing twice as much damage as in old days this skill is not noticable anymore (i think a warrior with critical hits, cripling blows, berserker mode and of course triple attack has much more additional damage now).<P>Make monk only armor sets have leather based ac, not below cloth based.<P>Give monks triple attack, both for gameplay and roleplay reasons.<P>Stop forgetting to care about the weight of equipment when designing new items, for monks this is a HUGE issue. Monks are excluded from a lot of good leather based armor, resist gear and things like masks, rings, earrings because of weight.<P>Explain why rogues and warriors get a whole army of casters in their backpacks (weapon procs that snare, slow, lifetap, dd, stun....) while the only proc types monk weapons get are stun procs?<P>Change monk innate resists from cold to magic, monks allready have it so much harder to get their resists up because of either class or weight restrictions on the best resist gear (bone fork, hole shoulders...). And for melee magic resistance is all that counts (slow spells, stuns, roots).<P><BR>Last but not least the change in 2h bonus dmg:<P>I really understand that you fixed the mosscovered twig with making it off hand only. This really was a broken weapon because it was to easy to get to be one of the most powerfull weapons in game. But why did you change bonus dmg for 2h weapons as well? Did you check which weapons you nerfed with the reduction of bonus dmg for weapons with delay below 27? I know two weapons. Swiftblade, a ranger 2h sword, not so good ratio for a 2h weapon for a class that concentrates on dmg dealing and for a random drop from chardok, but what made this weapon worth the effort was the low delay. Second example is runed fighter staff. This was the best monk non VP weapon. And for a good reason, it was the hardest to get AND rarest as well. Now tranquil staff not only has a nice proc but does more pure melee damage as well (risk vs. reward?).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Kung Fu is NOT acheived in one day, one level.<P>Split the weight every level for 0.1 and raise the original 14 stones to 16, or even better 20 since after RoK, monks need to train 1hb/2hb in order to remain competitive and those weapons are VERY HEAVY to monks.<P>III) In a normal pickup group, why a group need a monk over a Warrior/Paladin/ShadowKnight/Ranger/Rogues, i.e. all melee ? Seems no a signigicant reason.<P>Situation #1<BR>Group without a tank, Warrior/Paladin/ShadowKnight comes first.<BR>Situation #2<BR>Group already has a Tank, Rogue can do much more damage than a Monk yet Rogue is a MUST to some areas where pick-lock is requested, not to mention they're excel in CR.<BR>Situation #3<BR>Group need more damage output. Monk still have to competite with Mage/Necro/Wiz/Dru/Shm and all melee.<P>The only situation a group need a Monk over other 13 classes is only for FD pull, but the FD pull is nerfed too much :<BR>1) High level player can single pull in most RoK dungeons, FD pull is not effecient and time consuming at first.<BR>2) SoV FD pull is useless single mobs come in all, leave in all too. No way to split them.<P>Currently in game, the cases really need or good to have a monk :<BR>1) SINGLE group for Fire Giants in SolB, yet a SK can do the job too.<BR>2) Plane of Hate where monk gets nothing (except Inny, Maestro, but they are rare spawn yet rare drop monk items)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hail and well met,<P>There are two issues that I wish to address/accent.<P>1) Interrupt casters! This has been a problem since day one for monks. All of the large races receive Bash at level one while warriors also receive a kick that has the probability to interrupt/stun the caster. Monks have never been able to do this except under bizarre/extramely lucky conditions. This is not advocating that we get stun. What I fail to understand is how a caster will be able to cast a spell uninterrupted while receiving 200 to 400 hits points of damage from the start to the end of the spell? If a PC receives as 10th of this damage they are 95% sure to be interrupted. I have tried over the last 20 months to time attacks with the purpose of interrupting a caster. I recently went to the Sol A areas where casters are predominant and found that even casters 20 to 30 levels below me are near impossible to inteerupt. Monks are supposedly the masters of the physical attack. They should have the ability to disable their opponents in such a manner as to render unable to perform tasks such as casting (interrupt) or attack (stun). This is what defines the monks physical prowess on the battle field. The innate ability to avoid damage while disabling their opponents.<P>I have recently played a low level shamn and found it somewhat distressing that at level 1 I could have a chance to interrupt a caster since I have never really been able to do that in the 60 levels of playing the monk class. Please give this some careful consideration. I will not be so bold as to make suggestions on how to implement this since I have no idea how the coding is done. <P>2) Risk VS reward. Our AC on items is pathetic. The items with a very moderate AC have a cumbersome weight added to them. The latest embarrassment was the Velious tailored legs with a weight of 3. Venturing out to gather these components is difficult to start with only to be coupled with the insane rarity of the drops. Add to this that there is no current intermediate tailoring step from the Tailored Quivers (trivial at skill 115) to the Black Pantherskin armor. there is something missing between these two steps in tailoring. The expense, risk and current failure rate involved does not justify the end result.<P>Also, the plane of sky quest items are worthless since the release of Kunark. The risk involved to complete the plane of sky (not to mention the insane amount of time to run through any plane) is shadowed by the rewards. Every item is pathetic. No monk would would consider using any of these items as standard wear. This plane remains empty 90% of the time because the reward does not merit the risk. The only time it is occuppied is to help people obtain their epic quest pieces. Make the risks monks need to take to obtain their special items worth the effort. Add something of value to Venril Sathir and Trakanon that is monk only and worth the effort. Currently, these creatures have special drops for every other class but the monk. Hmmmmmm.<P>I did some whining in this post for which I apoligise but I cannot think of a better way to present these arguements at this time. Thank yoou for allowing us a chance to state our opinions when we know they will be read.<P>Whitewhisper Brightfist<BR>Long winded monk of Norrath</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Treant Fists: if these are to be improved in a MAJOR way (other than say, reducing the weight), they need to be made usable by Iksar also. I agree that they are currently not worth the many hours of camping, but if any major programming effort is to be put into remedying them, it should not benefit just the human monks. Personally, I think that, as long as they have the right faction, that the Humans should be able to earn and use the Shackles (as the Iksar can earn and use the headbands/sashes), and the Iksar should be able to earn and use the Treant Fists, Collar of Neshika and all other Monk items.

</FONT><HR>Epic Quest can be completed at first level.<P>How? The character only need to loot the tooth from Xenavorash.<P>Our epic quest does, infact, need to be looked at.  The reason for this is that as it stands right now the quest can be completed by a level 1 ( yes first level ) character.  That is a travisty.  The Treant Fist quest is more gimp resistant then the Celestial Fists.<P>The problem does not lay with the quest itself but in the ability to make end runs around the why quest was intended to be completed.<P>1) All headbands and sashes need to be no drop.<P>2) both monks for the Robe of the Lost Circle quest need to give you a no drop combinable container in which to combine the quest items. ( headband/book & sash/idol ) Whis is then turned into them.<P>3) remove the Robe of the Lost Circle from both monks associated with the quest.  Being able kill for the RotLC may have been appropriate prior to this being part of our epic, it no longer is.<P>4) The Robe of the Whistling Fist quest also needs to have a no drop item needed to complete the robe added.  ie, instead of a direct turn in to recieve the robe, you get something that must combine with the 2 pipes and robe in a large sewing kit ( no skill check please  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>5) The battles VS the Celetisal Fists can be triggered by anyone, and corpses looted by anyone.  there is no easy fix for this problem so i think it should be addressed at the final turn in by adding a container that you must combine the Demon Tooth and the Book: Celestial Fists.  This item is then turned into to recieve the final reward.  A great place to add the container would be when you first hand the book:Celestial Fists into the True form of Kerra ( sp ).<P><BR>Another point.  Abshor you stated in your post that racial balance of Human and Iskar is balanced by exp, I beg to differ on the basis of previous VI decisions.  The bare hand ( no epic ) "haste" of the two races was designed to be different.  Humans having the edge in speed with h2h through out the course of the game.  This rapidly became a moot point as monks had to start using weapons to keep up with other classes damage out put.<P>With the addition of the Celestial Fist changing the base damage and delay of the wears fists to 9dam 16 delay, humans lost our only trademark ability as monks.  No longer was the human monk the beatter ( if only slightly ) hand to hand fighter as a monk.<P>This is something I would like to see addressed with the epic.  Humans where to be the damage race as monks, Iskar the bruisers with steel jaws.<P>The only tweak that might adjust the in a fare manner is altering the skill check for double attack and or duel weild to make it nearly 100% of the time for human monks, most that are of a level for the CF are close already in to 100% on duel weild and double attack.  It's a modest change, but I think it address original intent that the CF negated.  What I'm not sure could be done is making this only aply to hand to hand.<P>As an alternative, code the CF to increase human wt max's by 1 or 2.  Why only for those with the CF?  This issue only effects those with the CF is why.  If the human trade mark of hand to hand speed is going to be made null and void please give use the ability to tank like a lizzy.  The Wt increase would do just that.<P>All that being said, one more here that supports the Monkly-Business posting.  ( but personally I feel the off hand damage bonus to h2h *only* would be the ideal solution )<P>The idea of multiple specials having a chance to fire is a fantastic one  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>A lot of dropped our jaw the very first time we ever saw a round kicks sat back on our heels and went " Wooooooa, that's COOL!".  I still watch my character fight sometimes, and seeing a move where it went through the various special attack combinations would still leave me going,"WooooA, that's COOL!"<P>8D</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>*** WHY MONKS SHOULD DO HIGH DAMAGE ***<P>Absor it is very easy to take for granted one thing about the monk class...<P>...our weight limit.<P>The Monk's life revolves around this pivot, and forces the adoption of an aesthetic no other class has to consider (look into it a little).<P>It is for this reason that a Monk is able to do what they do.<P>Monks aren't asking for a free ride when they expect their damage to be above and beyond that of a Warrior... we pay for it every single day of our lives. And every other class forgets this when looking at Monk abilities.<P>While they are all hefting out of the dungeon with packs full of loot after days of living in a dungeon, a Monk must consider each and every piece of loot, and pay for it with AC... this includes coin.<P>While they simply snap up the latest piece of armour, we must carefully consider and balance even the limited range of armour available to us.<P>So when you go to the design team, ask them to consider the rigours of a 14 weight limit until 55th with two modest increases thereafter.<P>It's easily overlooked, please ensure it isn't overlooked when it matters.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I think this is still an issue where the experience penatly does not make up for the regen, sight, forage and swimming skills.  The regeneration advantages offset the experience penalty because of less downtime.<P>I suggest Iksar Monks do NOT get the additional bind wound skill of 201 at level 51.  This will help balance the two races without radical change.<P>And I also agree the Brother Z should not drop the Robe of the Lost Circle OR the robe should not be able to be used in the quest for the Robe of the Whistling Fists. <P>Regards,<P>Lanick<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi<P>I was just reading in eqvault the monk discussion (I didnt read all 6 pages of rather long posts here), and I came up with something. I don't play a monk, never had and probably never will, btw. <P>about this:<P>[Quote from original post: Monks should have greater damage evasion skills than they currently have post 50. By this I mean Dodge, Block, Riposte, and maybe another. They are martial arts experts after all.] <P>Well, this is something that I seem to have encountered with the shadow knight talk earlier. Some want offense, some want defense. Keep in mind that it is highly unlikely that getting both would be balanced. When compared to a warrior, a monk will either be more offensive and less defensive, or the other way around. Being better at both isn't balanced. <P>I think that monks should be given both attack and defense abilities, but let them "use" only one of them. I mean, when attack abilities get high, lower the skill top on defense, and if defense gets high, lower the skill top on attack. This way, monks can actually decide if they want to be deffensive or offensive, play it their own way, and we'll have pretty unique monks.<P>Just my 2cp</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The Bodi post, yes this is what has been debated highly over by many people before this went to the message boards here.  Support and kudos to all the monks that helped hammer this out.<P>About damage:<P>Everything in the post loooks great, although i feel this ability should only come once past      50.  One thing that was commented by Absor that makes me wonder is the potential to outdamage rogues and having to inspect monk usable weapons etc..  Well, besides the Twig (which the post covered) there aren't really any super low delay items here that would even come close to upsetting a rogue's damage dealing ability.  <P>Before celestial fists, monks agreed that after the twig was nerfed (and for good reason), the jade mace in the primary hand was where it was at.  I highly doubt a monk with two jade maces for example can contend with a rogue's super duper backstab.  Even with celestials fists, I still don't think a monk can come close if this damage in offhand bonus was implemented.  In doing this, this would put us above warrior damage which every monk agrees is where it should be.  It's quite sad seeing a monk with celestial fists, our epic weapon, using a Stave of Shielding in the offhand but quite frankly, it does more damage.<P>About the epic quest:<P>Take the robes of the lost circle off Brothers Qwinn in South Karana and Zephyl in Rathe Mountains. 160 hour camp on a single spawn in lowerguk, or go to Rathe Mountains and kill Brother Zephyl?  Provided with the means, the choice is obvious.  This change ALONE will make the epic quest harder to complete.  If you feel to make it even more difficult to complete than this step alone, make the two pipes needed in Chardok and Karnors NOT be able to be multiquested.<P>-makino</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I played a martial artist in another game and I really liked the way the quests were implemented. First you went to this pagoda. On the first floor you met a trainer and he gave you a quest to accomplish and you got an item which let you pass to the second level if it was in your hand. Then after you got up to the next level you were in a fight for you life against a MOB. IF you were victorious you met the next trainer who had a quest that gave you a special attack when done. He also gave you another item that let you pass to the third level. To make a long story short some levels of the pagoda gave you items some gave you items such as dragon claw guantlets. Lastly, it was a great feeling to finally make it to the top of the pagoda and look down at the world. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"The question here is, are monks supposed to do more damage than warriors and less than rogues. I don't know, really."<P>Answer:  Yes, we are.  Abashi stated on several occasions that the VISION was for monks to be the masters of toe-to-toe melee.  I.e., a rogue should outdamage us if he is behind the mob, but we should outdamage ALL OTHER melee from in front significantly.  It is our ONLY claim to group usefulness with the current nerfed state of the Feign Death skill.<P>"Interesting idea (monk throwing criticals). This can also be used to increase monks damage a bit. That it, IF it needs to be increased. But if anyone is going to be the master of throwing, it may as well be monks."<P>Bzzzt.  Rogues are already the master of throwing weapons.  Our throwing skill caps MUCH lower, and it is only used to attract monsters attention during pulling.  Monks are meant to be IN combat, not outside of it.<P>(on damage avoidance) "When compared to a warrior, a monk will either be more offensive and less defensive, or the other way around. Being better at both isn't balanced."<P>I agree, but you're missing part of his point.  Monks are meant to be an offensive class.  See Abashi's comments on the monk "vision".  However, with the state of Feign Death in Velious, and it's TOTAL inability to get us lower on the hate-list anymore, we have no way to get RID of aggro.  If we didn't have that to worry about so much, you would probably see only one or two suggestions for defensive abilities.<P>(on an off-hand damage bonus) "Maybe… it also sounds like it has a very high potential chance of bringing that damage output well above rogues… And having to go back and look over every monk-usable weapon list to make sure one of them isn't broken because of a change like this, well, that puts this idea very low on the list."<P>There are only TWO monk-usable weapons that are off-hand only.  The (broken) moss-covered twig, and the Essence of Dol, which is off-hand only despite being worse than an (easier to get) fighting baton.  No checking and rebalance needed. Or, if you're still worried, make it H2H only.  <P>And the comment about outdamaging rogues:  No, it wouldn't.  There is absolutely no way I will EVER be able to keep up with a double-backstabbing rogue using something godly like a Ragebringer, especially considering that we get just about the same number of attacks at max haste and Flying Kick and Backstab recycle times are similar.<P>(on an evade-type ability) "Hmm… Something that would be super defensive, prevent the monk from doing any damage, and allow him to back out (perhaps dropping them lower on the hate list). Oddly, that sounds like what feign death was supposed to do…"<P>It WAS what Feign Death used to do before it was nerfed to near-oblivion.  I often use Feign Death in combat to ATTEMPT to lower my aggro.  On perhaps one occasion in twenty or so attempts, it will actually work.  The rest of the time, the mob will continue to happily smear me into paste. Leave the other nerfs to feign in place if you like, but give us a drop on the aggro list using this skill, PLEASE.  It should work like Evade does -- and it still has all the drawbacks of evade, and will take us out of combat LONGER than it would a rogue.<P>-------------<P>Finally:  Monk/Warrior/Rogue balance.<P>The pure melees were extremely well-balanced before Kunark and Velious.  Warriors tanked, monks did massive damage from the front, and rogues did even MORE massive damage from the rear.<P>Now, with new weapons, rogues and warriors have scaled up in damage to meet the needs of Velious. Monks have not.  The epic fists are nice, but with them I am doing AT MOST 0-5% more damage than a warrior of my level with equivalent gear.  And the warrior can still earn better gear in Velious -- I'm done.  There ARE NO MORE DAMAGE UPGRADES FOR ME.  This leaves me no role in a group.  And THAT is the main reason monks are concerned in the post-50 world.<P>Why add a monk to the group when another warrior does virtually the same damage, has MUCH higher AC/HP/MR, and can taunt things off the casters?  I add nothing.  If it wasn't for my friends, I would never be grouped anymore because I add NOTHING to a group.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I feel the delay on fists should be reduced. Reason is you can get many weapons that are delay 20 or below however your fists are in the high 20's. To me, it doesn't make sense that a weapon can be faster than your bare hands (especially for a monk).  I feel H2H combat should have a delay somewhere between 15 and 20.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hey Absor, Brothers and Sisters, and other EQ addicts.<P>I play a 36 monk on the Bertoxxulous server, Pridewalker. Yes I'm not uber levled (yet) But I'd like to throw my buck-fifty into the ring for ideas on improving the monk class<P>1) Like everyone has said, we're supposed to be the toe-to-toe masters of damage. We're also suppose to be the master of unarmed combat. RoK has made us dependant on expensive weapons, a fact I don't like. It kills rp but if I don't go with the trend and spend a couple dozen K on a Wu's stick/KD combo I can't keep up with the rest of the players my level, my damage output is virtually nothing, and people regard me as a weak character. I know better, but when my fists hit for maybe 35 MAYBE 4 times every 3 and a half seconds, when my SK and warrior friends are hitting double 60s to double 80s every three seconds, I feel weak too. I honestly think a 1 point increase in dmg per five levels, with a 3 point increase at 60, should do the job.<P>2. Is it me, or are Dual Wield and Second attack not as effective as I'd like them to be? My dual is up to the 190s already, and I still only get two attacks about 60% of the time...I won;t even mention how rarely I get the third, or even fourth attack, with second up to around 170. Maybe this is a lower-level concern, and in the highers people always double and often quad. My concern is that the avg warrior my level almost ALWAYS dual wields. Rogues I know almost ALWAYS quad from behind. I mean, I disagree with triple attack as a solution...heck I'd love it, but that's just too much dmg...I think it'd overbalance us..but let our 2nd attack and dual work a bit more effectively please.<P>3. I share the concern about FD and hate wipes post 32. Doesn't even make sense realistically...OK you're in a fight and suddenly your heart stops beating, you fall to the ground and go still, faking your own death. Your enemies see this, cheer, and wander off. So maybe 5 minutes later you get up. The badies are at the bar down the street. Suddenly, one of them snaps his head up, and the whole gang runs back at you, suddenly sensing you are alive. Um..I don't think this'd happen in rl. Just please consider making feign actually useful again..sometimes it seems my only recourse is to /q or zone, which in some circumstances is ridiculous.<P>3. Monk_00 kicks A mob_01 for 85 damage!<BR>   Warrior_02 bashes A mob_01 for 3 damage!<BR>   A mob_01 is stunned!<P>OK, does anyone else see anything wrong with that? Heck if I took a flying kick to your face you'd likely be unconcious, or at least seriously stunned!<P>4. Here's my wacky idea: meditate for monks. Not for mana, but HP. Hear me out please: I've always been under assumption we were the "lone ronin" class, built for soloing. but warriors can solo better than me, due to their higher AC and HP. I won;t comment on that, they deserver higher AC (they do wear plate after all), and maybe hp (they are bigger, tougher, healthier sorts). SO they have less downtime. What I'm suggesting is a meditation skill..heck make it level 40+ skill. You have to sit down, click a med button, and NOT move or fight. if you do so and the skill is successful, you regen double hp. OK I do see two problems with this: Iksar already regen, and there are monks out there with Fungi Tunic. Best suggestion I can give for that is let it only recover 50% more hp for Iksar, or have it change monk sitting hp regen to a flat 10 points/tick or so across the board...and have it NOT stack with other regen effects. I dunno it's a litle over the top, but it's a thought.<P>4. In the avg solo fight against a yellow HG I get swung at 100 times or so. I get hit 50, 40 times I am missed...10 times I block/dodge/riposte. Um...sometimes I don;t see a block or dodge for 10 fights straight. Seems to me a master of the martial arts can pull off a block a LITTLE more offten then that.<P>5. Gloves can too change h2h stats..the CF now prove that..if you guys have a model, why not make a few more gloves like that? <BR>*cough*extra point of dmg for treant fists*cough*<P>I mean, I camped for my Treants over 30 hours, and I'd like to feel I got something worthwhile for that. Or maybe 2 points for Shiverback/Grandmaster's/White Lotus/Silvermoon?<P>And as a personal favor...more robes! it's ALL about kicking butt and wearing a dress  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Seriously we could use a few new outfits..and I don't feel it's fair that our "uber robe" the ROTWF, looks like a Buryai legion Gi.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 8 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053085-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053085.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053085-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053085-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053085-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053085-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053085-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053085-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053085&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053085&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
