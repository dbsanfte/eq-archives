I constangly watch every DD class start nuking 32khp mobs at 70-80% mob health, doing 800-1650 damamge per nuke, and i cast a stupid 1000 damage DOT spell when the mob is at 40% and i get summoned and beat on. Stop it. <P>"But that spell has a Str debuff compenent that should increase the hate value above the normal DD"-likly Verant responce<P>Bla bla bla take it out then, its usless anyways. If you never win a fight because a mob w/ 250 str got it reduced by 40(or whatever) for the last 20 seconds of his life. <P>Thats what makes the necro class near useles in raids.

</FONT><HR>I think, after reading several posts from this thread, that I will continue playing my lvl 27 necromancer and simply start early on my life as a mana battery. Thank you Verant for ruining my concept of what a Necromancer is and should be. By the way, since you Verant people no longer have a clue what a necromancer is I suggest you go read some good books. Try some forgotten realms, Lord of the Rings, look up Necromancer in an AD&D book, and play one on a MUD some time. Unfortunetly, i'm a die hard Necro fan (no, not verants version) and would play one even with the promise of being a lowly mana battery hanging over my head, instead of being a master of the Undead. One last shot at Verant, you guys made an RPG, the fact that you can't remember that and what it means scares me.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>About the high lvl mob corpse poofing.. Recently on Prexus, the cleric epic quest dragon, Zordak, had poofed.  Best estimates are on it being caused by a player going LD during the fight and getting in the last hit, but it is highly doubtfull this player did the most damage of everyone there.  <P>You say there are safeguards for DoT's poofing a high level corpse.. well, why aren't there for an LD player landing the final blow on an uber mob?

</FONT><HR> Alan,<P> When we speak of transfer ratios, were not talking about our Lich/Arch Lich spell lines. Those only effect us and were happy with them. What we are speaking of however are the Subversion spell line, where we cast the spell and give a portion of our mana to another caster. For instance, the level 44 version of this spell costs 300 mana to cast. It in turn gives 100 mana to the target caster. These are the out of whack ratios we speak of. <P> It was never really even an issue until RoK and Velious because the role of the Necromancer had not changed until then. It was a novelty spell more than anything. Passing through Oasis, I would see some casters sitting along the shore and mem one of my subversion spells and give them a twitch for the heck of it. Now it seems to be our primary role in high end raids and encounters. We pass mana. Ok, fine. We dont like it, but we will do it. BUT, if this is to be our role, at least make the ratios of the subversion(not lich) spell line better. If we cannot tap, then we cannot gain HPs. If we cannot replentish our HPs on our own(read: without using another healers mana), then what good is it to bother casting Lich and making more mana?<P> As for the whole lure tap thing. Nobody herethat I have seen has asked for a lure spell. We dont want that. Let the wizards have lure, they are DD masters and as such should have those. What we are suggesting is putting the life taps on the same RESIST setting as lures. Our piddly life taps are NOT going to drop Trakanon where he stands. Im sorry, its not gonna happen. Whoever even suggested this could happen has been sniffing model glue. What this does for us necros is allow us to land a lifetap on an epic mob to HEAL ourselves. Again as Ive stated before. I dont know too many necros that use lifetaps for damage spells, over the level of 20. It causes damage, yes, but its main purpose is to heal the necromancer, not just from battle damage, but from their hp/mana conversion spells. Thats the staple of the necro. Groups should love having necros on raids. On paper its wonderful, Necros are such a self sufficient class, nobody needs to watch over us and keep us buffed and healed. We, pre 51, can do that all ourselves. We do damage to the mob and we can heal ourselves and keep making mana. Its a wonderful idea really if you think about it. A self sufficient class that works great with a group. But this is where our argument begins. Without the ability to damage an epic mob in the highest levels of the game, we are left with ony a couple options. Cast DMF, Summon Corpse, Pass out mana. Ok..it sucks, but hey..ya gotta do what ya gotta do right? This is where the logic gets lost somewhere.<P>Lich = negative HPs = positive mana<BR>Lifetap = positive HPs = negative mana<BR>Subversion = negative mana for Necro = positive mana for target caster<P> When one of these chains is broken, the whole viability of the class even being there is lost. Youre just lost in the mosh as it where. Youre taking up bandwidth and causing and extra X amount of lag(whatever that formula is per person).<P> Yeah, if the raid goes bad and Trakanon is camping 20 corpses, everyone is your buddy. But guess what..."raids over, sorry you missed it man. It was really awesome, oh and by the way, could you pull my corpse to this spot instead of that one over there? Thanks man!"<P>Having the 49+ lifetaps set on a lure RESIST rate is NOT giving Necromancer the Lure line of spells. Its giving them a chance to land a Lifetap on an epic mob. Thats not even in the same ballpark with a wizard lure.<P> As for the skele effect on Ignite Bones/Chill Bones. Why cant you remove it? What purpose does the skeleton effect have other than ornamental? Its window dressing, all we care about is the 500-510 direct damage it gives. And to have it banned from raids because of its "rockin" effect is sad.<BR>And I can sympathize with the tanks on this one. I used to use it on Seafuries in OOT and the warriors would get sooo angry with me. Basically what youve done is this.<P>A warrior has to be in range to hit his target. Most melee weapons have an average of range 40. Dont ask me what the actual formula for figuring out range is, I dont know. Ok, so say you have a warrior with a weapon that has a range of 40. Basically hes toe to toe with the beast(or toe to knee on big mobs), ok you cast ignite bones on the target it poofs into this skeleton. The attack range is messed up now. This could cause a round of melee to be completely missed, and with a gang of melees on a target in an epic fight, thats alot of damage that could have helped. Not to mention the spell effect lasts for somewhere around 10 seconds. So as soon as it wears off, BOOM, big bad giant is back and the warrior is now in the epicenter of the polygon pile. This again is nothing more than a distraction to the melee classes, and can often times be disorienting. <P> I could understand it if there was some usefullness to the skeleton effect, like having it take undead damage spells...but it doesnt, its not undead. Or if it gave it the same properties of a skeleton, having low MR during the time it is in this form...but it doesnt. Its the same mob, just in a different form that means nothing but window dressing. Can you understand where the problem is with this?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The problem with improving raid only encounters for Necros is, like Absor has mentioned, that any improvement would be across the board and not just for raids which is the only problem.  Is it at all possible for a dungeon/plane/or both specific spell to exist?  The Shaman shrink spell already works like this. Unfortuantely I have no specific ideas. I'm sure others can come up with some good un-godlike spell ideas...and LOTS of godlike ones (I'm all for a corpse explosion spell...if you thought the DOT bug pissed others off...).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Everybody notice Alans thinly Veiled "quit complaining or we'll nerf you again" threat?  That was pretty pathetic.  If Lich hadn't have been affected by the "bug"  It would have been brought up as something that needed to be fixed by necros long before this.  I still have no clue how we are "great in all other situations" when raids are the ONLY situation post 50.  I still have no clue how Verant thinks it's appropriate or fair to change what was promised to be a damage dealing class into an *extremely* substandard support class for the second half of their game career.  (Alan, if you don't believe me, I can personally level a necro from 1 to 50 NONTWINKED in the same amount of time that I can level a necro from 50 to 55)<P>Here's the bottom line.  Necros aren't happy with high lvl game life.  That's YOUR problem Verant.  If you don't think the suggestions given here are reasonable, then come up with some others, because I *guarantee* you that if you leave all the people who play necros with a bad taste in their mouth and unable to believe that they wasted well over a thousand hours leveling that character, you will NOT retain a lot of customers for future titles.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First off, I'd like to say I've played the necro class since, beta and I have always liked the class and still do.  Here are my suggestion to helping the necro class on large raid situations.  And make the class a more viable class in general.<P>1. How about a "group" DMF spell.  I don't see how this would unbalance the class in any way, but it would make this part of raids easier.<P>2. Fix DMF so that it will work in underwater zones.  Verant's "cheap fix" to people exploiting with levitate, made the best underwater breathing spell in the game only useful for trak raids.  How about a version of this spell without the Levitate effect, that will work in such zones as Siren's Grotto, Kedge Keep, Plane of Sky or Velketor's Labyrinth(invise backstabbing spiders anyone?)  <P>3. Removing the skeleton effect on the ignite bones/chill bones would probably reduce 90% of the whining about necros.  These spells will land on uber mobs, maybe not very often but they will land.  If they skeleton effect was removed necro's could actually nuke something without being told to, "please remove that spell from your spell slots."  I'm sure you could even take out spell interrupt component of this spell without much complaint.<P>The next points aren't related to raids, just necromancers in general.<P>4. Yay, finally after 2 years, too many days played and 2 expansions Verant has put mobs into the game that our dots can run full course on.  Yes, i'm being sarcastic, but at the same time I'm elated.  I actually cast splurt 3 times on one of the giants in Kael. <P>And a shameless, personal plea to Verant.<P>5. FIX this item!<P>[img]http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/robeofthemystic.jpg[/img]<P>In general I think the Necro class is pretty balanced and you won't see me complaining too much about the class.  Great for groups, not so great for raids.  Even saying that we are not at all ineffective on a raid and a good, smart necromancer can bail a raid out of a tight situation.  <P>Zotreth Beion`Dhevel<BR>-=60th Warlock=-<BR>Coterie Nocturne<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Yet again, Ayama has failed to miss the point.  The original post that started all of this was that the Necro class is DEAD.  I pointed out that we are in fact NOT DEAD.  Sorry if my skillz are not as l33t as yours Ayama, I don't care if they are or not, I just like to play the game with my friends and have fun.  First of all, I DID say the skel illusion was useless.  Second of all, I do know that our lifetaps don't land on most epic mobs.  And third of all, how would you know who I do and don't talk to on the server?<P>I think you are the one who is misguided on the subject.  I do not want to see another player stop playing a class they started out loving just because of people like you saying we're useless.  We're NOT useless.  I'm well aware of the fact that we need things changed, and while your post might have gotten my commendation, since you couldn't produce anything well thought out about your fellow player, I think your post says nothing.  <P>My point, offer a possible and probably solution to the problem.  Don't post on here saying My skills don't impress.  Don't post on here stating you are a god.  You are a player, just like me and every other necro.  I just don't want to see another necro quitting because they haven't fully explored and learned the class.  A necro is fun to play and CAN be beneficial to ANY group under ANY situation.  <P>Let me check one more thing.  Oh, I didn't post here saying you sucked or whatever now did I?  NO.  You haven't changed a bit Ayama.  Quit acting like you are better than everyone else and treat others with some respect that they deserve.  Want to know how I see this problem being fixed?  Fix the lifetaps, it's as simple as that.  While I think the skel illusion on chill/ignite bones is useless, it does make sense from the description of the spell.  You're burning flesh away, that was the way it was designed unfortunately.  <P>My solution is to fix lifetaps so the can land on epic mobs.  How?  I really don't know all the details involved with why they were changed to begin with to be honest.  It stands to reason though that since lifetaps are our staple line of spells that we could make use of these under any circumstances.  Another possible solution is to give us a line of spells that would work on these epic mobs, what that might be I don't know.  And a third, and I think more viable solution that would make everyone happy is to eliminate the corpse poofing bug.  This is what the high level necro's want as well as the people who they play with.<P>You're right Ayama, I'm so lost, I don't impress.  Obviously you still have your head in the wrong place.  I have a solution for that as well, try pulling your head out and looking around you a little more often.  I do see necro's doing these epic raids.  They aren't getting "parked" as you so eloquently stated.  You even admit this yourself that you are so valuable to your group in these situations.  Here's what strikes me as odd about that.  This post is about how we CAN'T do anything during an epic battle.  But YOU deal so much damage that you are indespensible to your group and the raid.  Why don't you stop being a hipocrit for about 5 seconds and start being part of the solution and stop being part of the problem.  <P>Thx Info<P>Aieklul Soulleach<BR>53 Necromancer<BR>Povar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

This is not me making things up, I was on some of the first dragon and god kills on Bristlebane, and let me tell you, wizards were ALLWAYS there doing damage. A necro would pop in, tap, run out, and heal their pet, since the AoE from the dragons, or the damage from the gods would damage a necro far faster than they could heal with taps. With the replaced, hp, the necro would heal a tank or so.<P>So, when you posted-<P>"Too bad history didnt include the new spells and issues we are talking about, then what you are saying would almost - almost - make sense."<P>What are you refering to? The high lvl taps, like <BR>Trucidation, castable once every 10 mionutes, with the highest cost of ANY spell in the game, or the 705 pt tap?

</FONT><HR>Kytarna<P>I had purposeful ignored you post since it really has little to do with the main problem we've been discussing.  You keep giving us junk about how we can make mana well enough using regrowth or whatever else buffs you want to talk about.  Problem is that somewhere, you missed the boat.  Maybe you have difficulty reading, or maybe it's just with comprehension.  I don't know, and frankly I don't care.<P>Necromancers are masters of DoT as lifetaps.....NOT MANA BATTERIES!  The whole arguement started on the basis we aren't allowed to do any damage to uber mobs even though our class is, or was, an offensive spell caster.  I don't care if regen or anything else will help me give a wiz or cleric mana faster.  That's not the class I signed on for.  I'd start a bard if I wanted to be a support character that supplied mana during big battles.<P>Forget the mana conversion ratio and other smoke screens that we have been steered into arguing about.  That was never the point.  That was just a way for VI to get us away from the point without just saying "sorry you necros are just screwed!"  <P>The point is why was our class radically redefined from damage dealer to support in the post 50 uber raids.  <P>Lets see if we can keep this in mind people, otherwise before you know it we'll have an upgraded mana transfer and somehow and be stuck as mana batteries and come away thinking we won, when in fact we will have dug our own grave.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Oops, didn't realize that the level 60 tap required an essence emerald. Sorry.<P>Anyway, the arguement here about taps seems to be "We don't want to use them for damage we just want to heal with them." <BR>An unresistable/lure resist Touch of Night, which from what I see, would be a 720 tap costing 405 mana. Cast time 6 and recast 0.<BR>Wizards Magical based Lure is 680 damage, 320 mana, 4.5 casting time and 0 recast time.<BR>Wizards with Clarity 2 and Manaskin would regen mana at 12 additional per tick while not medding. Necros with the highest Lich will regen at an additional 20 per tick costing 20hp per tick (now that we have heard about lich only doing 66% damage to the caster). I don't know what the base regen rate standing is so I will assume 0.<BR>Call the total manna pool 2520 (source: castersrealm with 200 int and no mana items).<BR>Wizards could cast their magical lure 8 times for a total of 5440 damage in about 36 secs.<BR>Necros could cast Touch of Night 6 times for a total of 4320 damage/tap in about 36 secs. Start with a DoT lifetap and damage would be higher.<P>Efficient as a wizard? No. Too close for comfort though considering that the necro has the potential for pacting away some of those extra HP's and the ability to do other things that a wizzy could not do.<BR>Necro's with lure lifetaps would end up being damage dealers whether the initial intention was to be one or not. Verant would either have to give Wizzys undead pets and summon corpse or Necros would have a the ability to cast that 60 lifetap a lot as the wizzys would be happy to sacrifice themselves, being obsolete above level 50 anyway.<P>Hope I am not making a fool of myself again but this is an idea that needs to die.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sheesh.<P>Firstly stop the over the top whinging. Yes necros are very  on raids and need a little tweaking. Making lifetaps work like lures would be rediculous, I`m not even going to discuss that.<P>The idea of us acting like mana batteries thou is very viable and tbh I would like to play this role more on raids. If a clerics lom and you provide the mana for those last few heals, personally thats satisfying, you played a key role.<P>I think the current problem is these spells are so inneficient, it`s a case of the necro spends a minute emptying his mana on the cleric...who possibly notices his mana bar twich once or twice then goes back to sleep. 400 mana spent by the necro for 150 transferred for example really is poor. That means the necro would have to spend say 1600 mana to give the cleric a new heal spell...over half his mana *and it would take the best part of a minute to do this too*<P>Necros can currently transfer hps at a 1:1 ration with a tiny cost of mana. It`s balanced by the fact its slow...a dot heal not an instantaneous thing. If for whatever reason you don`t want to make the subversion spells a bit more efficient what about giving us a mana dot transfer that`s efficient in a similar vein to the lifetransfers?<P>If the mana transfer spells were a bit more efficient I think most necros would be satisfied they were helping on a raid. The piddly ratios in existance atm makes it just seem like they`re doing it as a desperate last resort as theres nothing better to do and it isn`t really making much differance.<P>Personally I`ve never seen why they aren`t more efficient. Lets say it was 1:1 on the mana trasnfer so a necro could theoretically double a clerics mana on a raid. Amazingly overpowering...or of course you could recreat this uber effect by replacing the necro on a raid with a cleric <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">?<P>Either make the transers cheaper to cast on the necros side if you`re worried about to much mana swapping hands *even with the best one its only about 150 mana every 20 seconds, this isn`t earth shaking stuff* or maybe add some dot style mana transfers that were efficient, in the same vain you have shadowbound as a very efficient hp transfer, but takes 24 seconds and corporal empathy, an instant 300hp transfer but costs a lot of mana to make up for it?<P>Sepharoth, 60th Warlock of Bristelbane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>How about this, modify Splurt so that it saves on Cold or Disease resistance instead of pure MR, but keep it at the same resistance, so that it can stick on epic monsters the same way Ignite Blood does.<P>Otherwise... The only problem with making lifetaps 100% unresistable, truly, is the matter of Touch of Night.  Deflux and the other lifetaps are all too slow or have a bad ratio that they come nowhere close to the wizard lures.  Only Touch of Night is different.  So my suggestion would be to make all lifetaps up to Touch of Night unresistable to most of the epic mobs, and make Touch of Night stay the way it is.  <P>My final appeal is to make more DoTs.  Come on Verant, I know you think this is overly powerful, but let's look at the necro's DoT repertoire on epic monsters:<P>Ebolt - resisted 90% of the times<BR>Plague - resisted 90% of the times<BR>Blood - decent stick rate<BR>Splurt - resisted 99% of the times<BR>Asystole - resisted 99.99% of the times<BR>Vex - resisted 100% of the times<P>So the only spell that could actually really do damage is Ignite Blood/Pyrocuror.<P>Tell me, why is it that poison and disease are so darn hard to stick on an epic monster? I can understand the high MR, but when necro DoTs only cover three resistances aside from that(disease, poison, fire) and two of those resistances are overriden by shamans, we really do need some other type of spells that DOES stick.<P>But now if I suggested a DoT that saved on Cold wizards are going to complain that they were the ones who should cover all four elements not necros.  So I can't do that.  Yet with so many creatures with 100% MR I figure how else can you change high level raids?<P>The most effective and long lasting solution would be to look at the high level epic encounters in Velious and Kunark and reevaluate them.  High MR does not always pose a challenge.  High MR simply means certain classes are useless in the encounter.  The biggest and most effective thing Verant could do is lower the MR of some epic encounters to a degree that spells like Splurt or Asystole can hit them.  Yet if they did that, lifetaps would hit them as well, which brings us back to the "necros and enchanters too reliant on MR" thing.<P>/sigh I really can't see any solutions in sight that doesn't go against the concept that lifetaps should never hit epic monsters.  Not unless Verant wants to redesign all the necro DoTs.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Something about Ignite Bones. This spell used to have a long (10 sec) stun attached to it. This feature was removed because the necro pets were too powerful (lvl 49 pet was hitting in the mid 60s). Then pets got downgraded (many times) but the stun was not reintoduced. So much about history. The skel illusion is not that annoying as people try to make it look. In my opinion this spell can stay as it is. We need to solve more important problems than that one.<P>The general opinion on necros is that they are useless on raids with their offense. The reason is simple: Every dragons fears the pet and ALL offensive spells are resisted 100%. I think here is where the whole problem starts. It is the resists!<BR>I can fully understand that dragons etc. should be immune to stun and fear. I canNOT understand that they are immune to lifetap, envenomed bolt, splurt, bond of death whatever....<BR>If you think about it a bit then you will see that there is NO reason to stop necros from doing their share of damage. Why is a wizard allowed to hit Nagafen with ice comet while a necromancer cannot even tap it for 300 points. Honestly I cannot see a reason for this. Even scent of terris and all the other debuffs have ZERO effect on these mobs.<P>To fix the 'Useless-necro-problem' there is ONLY one possible solution. Allow necros to hit everything in spell range with necro spells. It sounds simple and in fact it is simple.<P>Neric Soulstalker (56 nec Xegony with 100 days played as necro)<BR>Shandrax Illuminis (59 enc Xegony)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I am talking to you about this because I do think it matters.  But too many people are trying to find some way to leverage this discussion to things beyond the point, which is the end of raids.

Keep in mind that players will be more creative than me<P>But if a necromancer could transfer mana 1:1 then he could throw his mana around at will.  Using the Lichy spells, he can convert his hit points 1:1 to mana.  So when low on hit points, he can give mana 1:1 to a cleric.  A cleric can heal the necromancer at a ratio better than 2:1.  In essence, then, the a necromancer working with a cleric could create mana from nothing  and that doesn't even consider regeneration<P>I hope that's clear:  1 necromancer hit point becomes 1 necromancer mana, which becomes 1 cleric mana, which is then turned into 2 necromancer hit points, which can become 2 necromancer mana<P>It's what Magic: The Gathering players call infinite mana.

</FONT><HR>Alan, You kinda proved my point.  You said that look at how much time you spent leveling up your character to go on raids vs the time you SPEND on raids.  I can level a brand new non twinked necro from 1 to 50 in the time that I can level a fully equipped necro from 50 to 55.  The exact level at which the game becomes completely raid based is kinda up in the air, but it's probably around 52.  The main point however is this:<P>RAIDS ARE THE WE ARE LEVELING UP.  You *know* the necro spells are completely unimpressive post 50.  There is absolutely no reason at all to level up if all a necro can hope to do is be a corpse summoner or *poor,poor,poor* mana transfer'er.  Please list me ONE reason I should go through the insane monotony of leveling past 52 if I am going to be *next* to worthless on the high level encounters.<P>You also state that the Uber Mob is the only part of the raid we have problems with.  That's not true either.  Our pets are nearly *NEVER* allowed on the WAY to the uber mob because of pathing and trains.  Any raid sized grouping of players is able to take out the yardtrash in about 10 seconds each, where a necro really can't do anything at all with his dots.. we've already gone over the Ignite/chill bones thing.  Necros can use their high lvl lifetap, which is good, but it's becoming an increasing trend to make the mobs 100% lifetap immune.  (check out velious).<BR>This makes the necro little use on the WAY to the raid, not quite as useless as at the UBER mob, but still less use than 90% of the classes out there.<P>I do understand the thing about the infinite mana of a necro when grouped with a cleric...but you *have* to admit that the current mana transfer is hardly noticable AT ALL, unless the necro is willing to go from full mana to zero mana (which takes quite a while with recast btw).  Again, this is only really an option at the end of the raid.  During the raid, the necro doesn't have time to get healed by a cleric and the necro's taps won't land so he can't heal himself from lich.<P>Bottom Line:<BR>I'm very confident in saying that the *majority* of high level necros (silent or not) are extremely unhappy with this new role that has been shoved down our throats after all the time and money we have invested.  Even if we WERE happy with being a support role, the twitching and summon corpse is not enough, especially now that an actually USEFUL class has our most important groupable skill.  (sk's and summon corpse)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Does she have a complex, someone clue me in, what is her deal.  Tells that guy he hit the nail right on the head WHEN HE DID NOT!  He missed it, he whacked his thumb, it is bruised, he is crying.  The level 60 life tap that he is so scared of takes a level 45+ un-resable full EXP death.  You know how much it costs to get someone to do that for you?   Take a look at exactly how many necros are using that spell on a regular basis?  They don't even keep it memmed, its worthless, they save the gems for more important things.<BR>    You claim our arguments are tired.  You aparently don't understand why we keep repeating them in different ways, so let me explain it, it is because we are trying to make people understand.  Some of the ideas that have been given make the necro class more powerful as a whole, this is true.  But you try finding abilities to make a necro better ONLY on raids, it is hard, aparently a whole fleet of paid Verant workers could not do it, so don't get all pissy if a few of us can't.  This may sound like a flame, and it may be, I don't know, I am new at the whole thing.

</FONT><HR>To the folks saying "Necros will just chain cast the lvl 60 1100 pt lifetap and be almost as powerful as wizards!" - this is patently absurd.<P>First, the spell has around a 10 or 15 minute recast time.  You -can't- chain cast it.  Second, it costs an essence emerald to cast.  This means a lvl46+ character suffers an unrezzable death for the necro to cast this spell ONCE.<P>This is a classic example of people who really do not understand the necro class looking at a single number "1100 pts of damage" on paper and thinking "Oh, the necro is an ubergod!"  when they really do not understand what is actually going on.<P>Touch of Night might be more of an issue - 720 damage points for 400-ish mana.  But of this is treading too close to wizard territory, then<BR>reduce the damage of this spell, or up the casting time, or something.<P>But to tell an offensive caster class that they can no longer damage creatures *in any way* and must now be content to transfer mana at a 3 to 1 ratio, is just absurd.  It is Verant's game and their right to do with it as they see fit.  But if that situation remains, I for one will be moving to the next promising MMPORPG as soon as one is available, and be very suspicious of any EQ2.<P>I *want* to keep liking EQ.  I don't want it to be too easy, and I don't want to be too powerful.  But neither do I want 100% resists on the spells that form the core of my class' abilities.<P>- scr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044793-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044793.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044793-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044793-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044793-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044793-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=044793&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=044793&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
