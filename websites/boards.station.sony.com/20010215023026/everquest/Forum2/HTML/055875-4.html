</FONT><HR>OK, you said you dont want to make LOH a CH due to low levels paldins giving a complete heal to high levels. While that would be nice as low levels could make a few pp from a lone warrior lets skip that point.<P>Why not make it a level dependant CH, ie if you are healing anyone say within 2 levels of you it is a CH if its higher than that then it proportionally lowers.<P>This might be too hard to code but i am sure something that gives the same effect is possible<P>Berevon</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello again. I'm back. I have three quick things today: two Flash of Light issues and a /bonk for silly people.<P>Flash of Light in PvP Situations<BR>I play on a regular, non-pvp server. However, I have noticed that when fighting in the Arena, when I Flash of Light somebody, they CAN STILL HIT ME if I am in melee range. They can hit me EVEN IF I'm behind them! That just makes no sense. Once they aren't blinded, they can't do that, but really, they can't see and they're nailing me when I'm behind them?! This has to be a bug.<P>Flash of Light improvement<BR>I only use Flash of Light when I am bored and want to make people scream in terror as I FoL a hill giant and watch as he runs around aimlessly. It's really quite funny, but overall, totally useless. I was thinking that perhaps when a monster is "blinded by a flash of light" that just PERHAPS some sort of modifier could be placed on the monster to increase their miss percentage until they regain their sight. Something in the neighborhood of increasing the chance to miss by ~25% would be great. <P>(Feel free to skip the next part, Alan, unless you want to hear about statistical-ish breakdowns of the paladin population on the server.)<P>/Bonk<BR>/Bonk to the person(s) who replied to the epic 1HS/Shield combo idea, saying that only people with the FA/FD should get it. That's ridiculous. You are the extremely lucky ones who got both of your dragon books. There are MANY paladins out there who might just LIKE the idea of getting a separate sword/shield combo epic reward. It's not infringing on your glory for getting the FA/FD, it's only giving an alternative to people who can't stomach practically retiring their main characters while they wait to get their quest items.<P>As a matter of fact, I can break down my server's paladin population and the FA/FD ratios quite easily, since I took two weeks and made a list of every 50+ paladin on the server. (I can't seem to find my list right now, so I'm going on memory here. I'll note where I'm not certain.)<P>Level 60: Two paladins, both in uberguilds. One with Fiery Defender. Other says the quest is a waste for the reward.<P>Level 59: Two paladins, one in uberguild, one in regular just-really-big-and-old guild. One owns Fiery Defender.<P>Level 58: One paladin, no guild currently<P>Level 57: Three paladins, until two weeks ago. One paladin quit the game because she was tired of being an ineffectual fighter. <BR>One retired his paladin and stripped him of all his items and started a monk, again because he was tired of being an ineffectual fighter.<BR>The remaining level 57 paladin is an SK in disguise (a.k.a. a jerk, described by most other paladins as "an SK in disguise"), and I think she is also in a guild close to uberguild status.<P>Level 56: Three paladins, two in the same "really big and old guild," one currently unguilded. One with Fiery Defender.<P>Level 55: None currently.<P>Level 54: Two paladins, one of which is an alt for somebody else's main. Both in "big old nearly uberguild" guilds.<P>Level 53: Four paladins, two or three of whom will will get their FA's on a Plane of Air raid starting in about 3 hours (Sorry, I haven't checked the raid roster for a couple days). All four are in large, powerful, but fairly new and not-quite-uberguilds-yet guilds.<P>Level 52: Nine paladins. One just got his Vox book last night, and has yet to complete the quest, since nobody felt like going off to kill Miragul at midnight on a Wednesday. Six more have the Nagafen book, but no Vox book, and have pretty much been guaranteed that they will get them in a specific order. The other two, I don't remember.<P>Level 51-50: Several, at least a dozen that I can think of. About half of them currently have or have been pretty much guaranteed to get the next Naggy books that drop.<P>46-50: about 20 paladins, various guilds.<P>My server typically runs 2k people at peak, so I am going to assume that our off-peak population is going to differ from the older server's off-peak populations, but not by much. <P>The point I am trying to make with all this is that NOT MANY PEOPLE AT ALL HAVE their Fiery Avenger/Defender, and therefore, adding a quest to turn the FD into a 1hs sword/shield combo would be really stupid and would cater only to very tiny and extremely lucky paladin elite population on each server. It would also serve to only exclude even further the non-uberguild people who wish to get their epics one day. I myself haven't even gotten to attend a dragon raid yet, since paladins willing to go for their books are always in ready supply.<P>Creating a second epic quest (with no major bottlenecks like the dragon books) for a 1HS/Shield that people of any level could complete would just be nice and wouldn't detract from the prestige of getting a FA/FD. Sheesh. Some people think they're the only people in the world who have needs that need to be addressed...<P><BR>We will now continue with our regular broadcast day.

</FONT><HR>Oops, quick clarification before I get flamed... When I made the comment about "can be completed by people of any level," I of course meant 50+ only. I was referring to the Naggy/Vox level ceiling and the Gorenaire/What's-his-name level floor that kind of leaves paladins between levels 53 and 59 out in the cold...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>While the new spells are a nice addition to the paladin's abilities, especially pre 50, they don't really address the short comings of the class. Being the "defensive" tank paladins should get boosts in their ability to defend. Low caps on defensive skills should be raised to equal the warrior's abilities at least, these skills being, dodge, riposte (questionable), parry and disarm. Our taunt skill should be raised too since we are to defend the casters and since we don't deal the damage that other melee classes do. Honestly I get somewhat embarrased when the ranger is getting hit so much in a fight and I'm barely getting hit at all. Paladins should be able to taunt the mob off of the other members of the party. An AC bonus is nice too since we should have better ac than rangers but with all the new armor rangers get a very competetive AC now. <BR>I would like to see crits and crips given to paladins when fighting undead but can see where it's not necessary and potentially unbalancing to the game. We have our nukes and Ghoulbane to help us increase our damage output against undead. Nothing is better than seeing my Ghoulbane proc right after I nuke. <BR>Even in the 40's I can see where we need buffs to add to our effectiveness in a group. Most of the time there is a cleric in the group and my buffs become useless it's much more so during raids. Since I see as the roll of paladins evolved into more of a caster in the higher levels I'd like to see more useful spells both buffs and offensive. Against undead we as a class are fine but against the living we've become severly lacking when our bread and butter spell, stun, becomes ineffective. Large mobs don't get stunned nor is it very effective as a taunt so something to suppliment this would be great. <BR>Equipment is another issue that needs to be addressed. There is a dearth of 1 handed swords and shields available to us. Some quested equipment of this type is nice too, make us earn the equipment. There are very few paladin only weapons out there that are decent and only 2 1 handed weapons, Ghoulbane and the Falchion of Koadavie (sp) that I know of. Armor along with weaponry should be examined. A ranger with proper equipment for his/her level will match a paladin's ac. In the 30's Ro armor is the mainstay of paladin armor and rangers get a comparable ac with mob dropped armor. And much of the dropped armor is wearable by both classes, it wouldn't hurt to have some paladin only no drop armor where we would get a nice AC. Examples of this are the Brigadine Tunic, the Mithril Breast Plate and Ry'gorr Battlemail. With the introduction of each expansions the prices of the first two have dropped dramatically and have become affordable to players who otherwise would not have been able to either camp the item nor afford it. Paladins become less effective in a group when rangers or other classes have to same if not better ac we do at the same level. The ac for paladins should fall in a range between warriors and rangers. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>--- ARMOR OF RO ---<P>A lot of good post 50 suggestions have been made.  A few great general suggestions have been made.  But it hasn't been stressed nearly enough how much the Ro armor quests suck for Paladin's in the levels 25 - 40.<P>These issues need addressing:<P>1) We don't want to ruin our faction with Fairies, and Gnomes.  If you consider the Ghoulbane for a second, we have to ruin our faction with Froglocks too.  Why do Paladins have to ruin their faction with all these good creatures, while Necro's, SK's, Rogues and other classes need not???<P>2) Ronium is waaay too hard to obtain.  Sand Giants are tough as hell, and Sands of Ro do not drop off all of them.  That requires us to kill 1 or MORE per piece!  Mistmoore Granite requires a good group of mid 30's to safely obtain.  Why is our class armor so much harder to obtain than others, yet is not proportianately better?<P>3)  If the quests are to remian as hard to complete as they are now, then Ro must be increased in power.  Otherwise the quests must become easier.  My Paladin will in all likelihood purchase DeepWater armor (Some of the best paladin only armor, and is definitely not for mid level paladins) BEFORE he is able to complete some of his Ro quests.  That is seriously screwed up.<P>Skellt</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I would like to add my 2cp worth.  Most of things I would add have already been said, but a suggestion I would make would be to change to 2 summon hammer spells to summon sword spells.  I know of few paladins that use 1hb while all use 1hs.  Maybe even make the first one a 1hs and the second a summon shield, or have 2 of each.  Just a thought.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I Play a 55 Paladin on Tarew Marr just to get an idea of my viewpoint.<BR>The following is a list of my concerns and possible fixes. I am trying to keep it as<BR>short as possible, while still giving as much information as possible.<P><BR>COMBAT.<BR>1.) Tanking ability.<BR>    The new defense cap fixes most of this issue. However, I would like to say to<BR>    ask people scared of this upgrade how much ac they think this will add?<BR>    In my experience, you gain 2ac for every defense point. So this upgrade is <BR>    225 to 252 = 27 def points. 27 * 2 = 54ac at lvl 60. Good upgrade, but imho  <BR>    not anything to endanger warriors.<P>2.) I miss a LOT.<BR>    Whatever skill affects hit/miss percentage please raise it. Our melee damage is dead <BR>    last how are we ever supposed to tank if we can't do enough damage or hit enough to <BR>    get a mobs attention? <P>3.) Stuns do not affect high level mobs? Normal mobs?<BR>    If this is true please fix this. One of the best things I offer to a group<BR>    in sebilis/karnors is stopping a mob from complete healing or gating, <BR>    many times my group has been saved by this.<P>4.) Lack of contribution to Big raids. No idea what can be done here, sorry. Giving them the<BR>    56 rezz will help though, but only afterward.<P>5.) Look at the damage using a 2 hander actually does. I heard a suggestion of upping<BR>    the lowest possible hit to the base damage of the weapon. This sounds very good as I <BR>    sometimes hit for 16 with my 30 dmg sword. But this might also cause a problem if done <BR>    to all weapon types as it will increase rogue/monk/ranger damage by a lot more<BR>    for they swing more and faster, possibly lessening our damage in respect to theirs<BR>    even more. But if done to 2 handers it won't be long before others ask the same for<BR>    all weapon types. Hmm, maybe not such a good idea huh? No matter, i'd use a 1 hander<BR>    anyway if I could get 1 better than ghoulbane.<P>SPELLS.<BR>1.) Celestial cleansing: 110 healdot per tick for 4 ticks, 1.5 second cast. 30 second recast.<BR>    I'll never use it, 440 hp? This is not even like a heal at all, it cannot keep up <BR>    with damage from any mob i'd fight at this level, anyone I use this on is dead. Your average<BR>    level 50-52 mob hits for 147 at 60 you will often fight higher level mobs.<BR>    Scenario: I cast heal on player, 110 first tick lands, mob doubles for 95 - 350, second<BR>    tick hits, mob doubles for 95 - 350, player is dead. <BR>    Suggestions: move superior heal to 52-54 and give us celestial healing (lvl 44 cleric heal<BR>    748hp over 24 seconds for 225 manna) at 57. <P>2.) Divine favor: 150 hp damage absorbing shield 150 manna, 1 second cast 6minute recast, lvl 55. <BR>    Ummm, 150hp at level 55? That's 1 hit from a lvl 51 mob. Please upgrade to 200-300hp and <BR>    lower recast time. 6 minutes is very long especially considering you must wait 6 minutes<BR>    after memming it to use it.<P>3.) Ressurection: waiting untill lvl 59 is a little long, especially since noone wants it<BR>    by the time we get it. <BR>    I saw this on the castersrealm page. Quote:<BR>    Move Revive to 39, Resuscitate to 49, Resurrection to 56, <BR>    Reviviscence to 59. The reasons pretty basic. Travel spells are shared by two classes <BR>    (Wizards and Druids). Damage Shields are shared by two classes (Druids and Mages). <BR>    Primary Pets are shared by two classes (Mages and Necromancers). Speed spells (SoW) are <BR>    shared by two classes (Druids and Shamans). All the ?market spells? are available from at <BR>    least two separate class sources, those spells which are generally being sought after. <BR>    Except Resurrections (specifically what people want when they want a Res, which is some of <BR>    their lost time back in the form of returned death XP); Clerics are always preferred since <BR>    they have the highest Res. Doubly so since 59+ Paladins are in such short supply. Granting <BR>    the hybrid this ability of the parent (Cleric) would not impact the parents tactical <BR>    abilities, only the support slot. And it brings parity to the market of spells we all <BR>    eternally have varying needs for as we play the game. I haven't met a cleric yet that'd <BR>    object to help in taking care of the eternal cries for 'Can anyone XP Rez?' <BR>    Unquote: EXCELLENT IDEA! If this cannot be done at least move Ressurection to 54 - 56 please.<P>EQUIPMENT.<BR>1.) Total lack of decent 1hs 1hb weapons. I still use Holy water sprinkler (16 dmg 29 dly 1hb)<BR>    because the only 1 hand weapon any better is sword of the morning (1hs 16 dmg 27 dly)<BR>    and costs 25-45k depending on who is selling for a very marginally better weapon. The only<BR>    1 hand weapon i'd consider using is the halcyon broadsword (18 dmg 25 dly nodrop) but it is<BR>    dropped off a rare spawn lvl 60 mob. I WANT TO USE A 1 HANDER AND A SHIELD. Ask any kid to<BR>    draw you a knight, what does he draw? A sword and SHIELD!<BR>    Solution: make more 1 handed weapons with ratios in the .7 to .9 dmg/dly range.<BR>    Meaning dividing damage by delay = a percentage. So halcyon broadsword is 18 / 25 = .72.<BR>    I read a suggestion of a continuation of the ghoulbane along these lines ooo can I hope?<BR>2.) Some new shields would be nice, maybe even a shield with effects. Like haste, a proc when<BR>    bashing or a right clickable effect. Somewhere in the 20-35 ac range with some bonuses to stats.<P>GENERAL GRIPES.<BR>1.) Spells on deepwater armor. These are all ridiculous. The only one I use is the daring on the<BR>    helm when smashing my way solo through lowby dungeons to heal. Invis to undead on 1 piece <BR>    would be nice. As would abundant drink/abundant food (better than cancel magic or lull).<BR>    Healing on 1 piece would be nice a 100 hp heal in 10 seconds is not too overpowering.<BR>    Armor of protection would be nice too.<BR>2.) The FA quest. First, just tacking on a little extra to the Fa quest to yield the fiery defender<BR>    was very cheesy and showed no thought was put into it imo. Second, after sitting at <BR>    52 for 3 months and seeing 1 book drop and rolling against 6 paladins I gave up and decided<BR>    to play and level as the quest is just too hard to receive a reward that is less damaging than<BR>    some dropped items. On my server I know of no one who has gotten the FA from kunark dragon<BR>    drops. People I know with the defender are Willis and Gorfan and Gorfan quit.<P>Ended up a book anyway, oh well.<P>Torval,<BR>55 paladin,<BR>Tarew Marr.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>BETTER BALANCE THROUGH DEFENSE PRE-50 CAN START WITH THE RO ARMOR!<P>RO ARMOR SUMMARY (if you think this is a long post, IT IS! That’s how difficult and long these quests are). I have TRIED to be as brief as possible on each topic but there’s a LOT of topics in this one discussion!<P>THE ARMOR ITSELF: Risk and time involved does NOT EQUAL REWARD at the moment and there is WAY too much other armor easily obtained that is BETTER, so why bother?  Ro Armor had been left behind in the expansions and needs attention.  Here’s how to fix it and improve our defensive balance in the process Pre-50. <P>The Breastplate:<P>Add 3 AC to the Breastplate, from 20 to 23.  This will make the BP viable for those who want to take the time to get it.  It will take longer to get, but will at least be worthwhile once you finish the quests!  Black Enameled BP is still AC of 25 but has no stat impacts. Dusty BP for small classes is AC 22 with some nice stat impacts. Other BPs are out there as well and this puts the Ro BP right in the middle of most of them at this level. The Paladin can make a choice without sacrificing too much in AC just to wear a rather plain Ro BP that currently only looks like Fine Steel.<P>Add 1 AC to all the other pieces. Simple as that and they become viable. Not the ONLY choice, but a viable one that a Paladin can make.<P>MAKE ALL THE PIECES GOLD!!!  That would help define the armor and us as Paladins, it would be a GREAT graphic, easy to do and people would know at a glance that we are Paladins and we are wearing Ro Armor. Currently, only the boots, gaunts and I believe the bracers are gold. The BP, Greaves, Vams and Helm are NOT! WHY??  But, in keeping with function before fashion, make the following changes. Here’s a recap:<P>+3 AC to the Breastplate<BR>+1 AC to the Greaves<BR>+1 AC to the Vambraces<BR>+1 AC to the Boots<BR>+1 AC to the Gauntlets<BR>+1 AC to EACH Bracer (with the other bracers out there: Scavenger, Erollisi and Hero, etc. these won’t get much use anyway)<BR>+1 AC to the helm<P>If you had ALL the pieces, this would be an additional AC of +10 for the armor and some nice stats to boot that are already in the game and if you make it GOLD it will help define us better.  Not much to ask considering how hard it is to get.  <P>MAKE THE MOLDS PALADIN ONLY!!  That’s right, I said PALADIN ONLY! I absolutely abhor the fact that I can buy MY defining Pre-50 armor from rogues, bards or anyone else who wants to do the quests on any given Sunday in EC.  Something is not right with that scenario. Only Paladins should be able to get the molds and use them to make OUR Armor.  The same goes for other Classes defining items as well, but I’ll let them argue the point.  STOP THE FARMING!!!  Once we outgrow the armor and get tired of it taking up space in our bank, (and if you make the armor worth while, that will be a while!)  we should turn it into our guild/church for a special spell that you can ONLY get that way, or some other kind of compensation so we don’t just DESTROY it.  Maybe turn it in for a better SHIELD, perhaps a DEEPWATER shield!  I’m sure our guild could put our old armor to good use.  Use your imagination here. Lots of choices and options.<P>Why not a SHIELD OF RO????<P>Add a Shield of Ro to the mix since many Paladins (and warriors for that matter) are DESPERATE for new and better, more class defining shields! Here’s the perfect place to add one for Paladins that has a nice AC bonus AND a Proc, and a nice graphic also!! It’s a natural fit into a quest already in the game.<P>ARMOR OF RO MOLD QUESTS<P>Make a few of the mobs needed for the Molds a little less rare.  Don’t make them easier to kill, just give us a better chance at getting to fight them and make the items NO-DROP! Also fix the BUGS!<P>Nightfall Giant: (Greaves Mold)<P>The Nightfall Giant should spawn every night, perhaps random times and places, but every night sometime during the darkness in WC.  <P>Undead Cyclops Skulls: (Helm Mold)<P>The Undead Cyclops’s should be the same as the Nightfall Giant.  A regular…. random time/place spawn.<P>Net Goblins: (Bracer Molds)<P>Fix the BUGS associated with the Net Goblins and that should do it. No suicides and a more frequent, not easier, spawn. With the other bracers already out there, this quest won’t get done much anyway. And YES, you have to continue to do the quest TWICE to get two bracers. They don’t come as a set.<P>Plague Sharks: (Vambraces Mold)<P>Fix the BUGS associated with the Plague Sharks and that should do it. No suicides. Spawn rate okay from what I’ve seen. You just have to know where to look!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"><P>Kilij Plans: (Boot Mold)<P>Nothing really wrong with the Kilij Plans Sand Giant issue except perhaps a more frequent spawn rate. (See below for Sand of Ro recommendations)<P>Sentry Locket: (Boots Mold)<P>Nothing too terribly wrong with the quest. I understand it.  But he should turn into a werewolf a bit more often, like every night!  As it is, most players, who are already investing WEEKS if not MONTHS into the Ro quests, don’t have the patience to wait night after night til he does. Have him turn every night so we don’t feel like we are murdering one of our own.<P>MM Cauldrons and Ancille Cooks: (BP Mold)<P>Nothing wrong with the cauldron spawns as long as the Breastplate is worth the risk! Right now it is not worth the risk so few people bother.  Mistmoore is a NASTY place (although one of my favorites) and to get the cauldrons you have to go right into the heart of the castle!  Make the BP worth the trouble…..NOT EASIER to get, just worth the effort!<P>RONIUM COMPONENTS<P>MM Granite:<P>MM granite perhaps should drop from the lowlier gargoyles in MM, but more rarely and it should DEFINITELY still be No-Drop. If it’s NOT No-Drop, people will just Farm it, Sell it, and no one will quest for the Ronium components. STOP THE FARMING. You gotta EARN IT guys, not just buy it all.  You can already BUY all the rest of the components. The MM granite is the ONLY one that is No-Drop, and yet people still whine about it. Add it as a much rarer, but possible, drop to the Grinning and Sneering Gargs at the ramp/tower entrance area and that should make it plenty easy enough.<P>Melatite:<P>The Melatite should drop from the Goblins in Sol-A instead of the Clockworks. We are killing innocent creatures and making enemies out of potential allies in the process. What’s to say the GOBS didn’t kill the Clockwork and now have some of the Melatite with them?  Personally, I think it should be No-Drop as well, but a bit more common of a drop from the GOBS, not the Clockworks. <P>Fairy Dust and Soil of Underfoot:<P>An even BIGGER travesty than the Clockworks is the killing of the fairies. I chose not to kill the fairies and bought my dusts (which goes against my EARN IT concept but felt it was justified in this case due to the injustice of killing the fairies).  But this does somewhat lend itself to the concept of murder for hire!  Let us kill something that deserves killing, not innocent fairy creatures. Maybe it should be “Undead Dust”, instead of fairy dust and you get it in Unrest instead of Lfay? If you want to keep in Lfay, add some undead to the undead altar that’s already there that drops the dust.<P>Sand of Ro<P>No problems here just make it No-Drop but drop EVERYTIME a sand giant is killed. Once again, make us earn it, but give us a chance as well. Sand giants seem plentiful enough in Oasis and South Ro.<P>Enchanted Platinum Bars (2)<P>A bit expensive to say the least when you consider that EACH piece needs TWO, but I can live with it.<P>FACTION:<P>Currently you need faction with ALL the major Paladin guilds in the game.  Even the Deepwater Knights.  I have not heard of another class quest that requires such a HUGE time and investment in building faction. Not complaining about that, just think the rewards should justify the effort. THEY DON’T!<P>CLOSING COMMENTS<P>The Armor of Ro and associated quests have GREAT potential and are already in the game! It needs an upgrade, perhaps a shield added in, make it all GOLD, STOP the FARMING, improve the AC (defense) and that should do it!  If you are going to improve BALANCE pre-50 by improving defense, here’s a good place to start with a quest that is already in the game.<P>Thanks,<P>Kneesmasher Ayebulger<BR>31st Circle of Dwarven Paladins<BR>Twilight Brethren<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I really dont think needs to be a complete heal. If you haved the post 50 game than you know that you save the cleric/enchanter first/evacer, before any tank. As it is right now, LOH will heal any caster type and this is fine. If there is anything that needs to be done to LOH, then would have to be decreasing the recast time.<BR> <BR>  But upgrading LOH for the most part isn't a class defining ability that gets us in groups anymore, its just a convienence. Since Absor is looking to balance and fine tune our class. I think LOH just needs some fine tuning. The real balance issue is that we need something that will make us valuable in practice not just thoery.<P>  The biggest mistake was basing classes off of other classes. All hybribs sound have been created unique, with unique spells and a few unique skills. But I think its too late for this to be undone. Second problem is how hybrids are balance to pure class( mostly pure melee ). From levels 1 to 50 hybrids scale well with pure classes, but its the levels from 50-60 dont scale at all. Maybe Verant wanted to change the rolls of the two at this point, but it only made things worse.<P>   Instead of scaling our skills post 50 like they were pre 50, they added more spells to make up for the difference. This sounds good in theory, seperating the hybrids from the pure melee be adding way more spells and only a few more skill points. This however doesn't work in practice. The idea fails because the spells we receive post 50 are not as powerful as they need to be in order for it to make up for the lack of melee/defense ratio that we used to have pre 50.<P> Most hybrids, if not all, liked the ratio of skills from hybrid to melee pre 50 and this were most of them feel the ratio shouldn't have changed. Not only that, but the way the mobs have scaled to a warriors skills has changed post 50 also. So the effect of our skills not scaling with a warriors is even more damaging to us now, because it scales even worse with the post-50 mobs than it does with warrior.<P>  We receive a spell or two for evey level post 50. This sounds great as we were used to haveing spells at every 10 (yeah I know there is a formula and not exactly 10) levels. The some of the spells are very nice too. But the spells come to us at a time when our parent caster class is almost always with us in a group(more true for paladins) and that is why the idea fails. Our spells given to us to make up for lack of combat skills become useless with our parent is group with us. So now were are reduced to sub standerd combat skills and spells we dont use because our parent class has better making us inefficiant in that area.<P> Warriors for the most part don't understand. They see us cast buffs/heals etc. But the don't realize how useless these really are. Yeah maybe they would be very useful when soloing, but 1) Verant is anti-soloing. 2) the mobs post 50 dont scale with the combat skills like they did pre 50. This is why were are barely and to solo a low blue and when we do it takes so much down time to recooperate that it just isn't efficiant to do so.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Lola-Hoss<P>Myself and everyone else dont like the damage we can do.  It obvious Verant will not boost our offensive skill stats to make us match a warrior.  So can you tell me why you are opposed to having a few weak DD spells to help us out a little by being able to do damage to ALL mobs?<P>Ranger and SK can deal out considerable more damage to ALL lower to mid level mobs not just undead like we can and SK's can also do damage to undead mobs like we can and everything else.  I as a paladin would like to add a little kick to my attack by being able to harm all mobs not just undead with with dd spells just like ANY other hybrid class WHY IS THIS NOT THE CASE FOR PALADINS.<P>Strike lvl 9<BR>Furor lvl 22<BR>Smite lvl 39<BR>Wrath lvl 53<P>Why would anyone refuse these spells if Verant decided to give them to you.  I am sure these spells wont over balance a Paladin and I am still just below lvl 30 so I dont know how tough it is to fight these so called uber mobs and of course these spells wont be of much help.  But I think these spells would make a Paladins life easier and start us toward class balance.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am not going to get into the extreme of this, but I wille explain ounce again my reasoning with the idea of the FD having a mini quest to upgrade its ability to be a 1hs/shield combo.<P>The Fiery Defender, which many paladins have completed, and as you said, was VERY hard to do, took alot of time, etc.  were very dissapointed for the most part that their epic weapon was a 2HS Weapon.  Time and time again we have asked verant back w/ the SF/FA to have it 1HS!  So what Absor was responding to in our request was that he could possibly have a solution made to the paladins who were hoping for a 2HS/Shield Combo/1HS - 2HS addon quest.  It wasnt that big of a request, and it made perfect sense since we are Paladins the Defensive Class, We and SK are the ONLY classes who use shields, and finnaly Fiery Defender needs to be a Defender *Defensive proc shield/Fiery proc sword* How does the Fiery Defender DEFEND you when you use both hands w/ it, open for attacks w/ no sheld? 2HS Are the offensive weaopons, everyone knows that. <P>You are saying, you are selfish what about the Paladins who dont have fa/fd's and can't get a new flashy epic 1h/shield too.  This response by Absor was stating that he would help w/ the solution and bring it to the staff about a 1hs/shield combo WITH THE FD.  This wasnt about making a new epic quest alltogether, and he stated that.<P>People presented a problem with their Epic Reward, and its being adjusted/fixed we hope to the 1hs/shield combo idea that was presented and acknowledged.<P>As for those who dont have fa/fd's and you are saying it is not fair that they dont have a chance at a 1hs/shield combo, well I think you know the answer to this one.  Absor, Abashi, and Brad posted that the EPIC was not for everyone.  Not everyone will be able to get one.  I think you understand now I hope.  If not, what can I tell you.  All the paladins today who have FA/FD's got theirs did they not?  Was it impossible no, and can anyone do it? Sure, why not?  It just reqs the work/legwork/time and questing.  So instead of complaining about not having a fa/fd and how those that DID get their fd want the 1hs/shield combo.  Go out their and quest for your FD! Good luck to ya!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One last idea I think is REALLY good...<P>We (Paladins) are the ONLY hybrids who don't get damage shields. I think we should. However ours should be unique.<P>I think I have a way to solve our lack of damage in big raids. <P>I am suggesting a spell called "feedback". It's a self only buff that is a damage shield against nukes. Why is only melee currently sbject to damage shields?<BR>We are Knights Templar right? Shouldn't we be able to use the power of our minds to return some of the magical damage that hits us?<BR>So when something nukes us it would get 10% (just a random number, could be any percentage or just a fixed number based on level) of the damage returned to it as feeback. This would be an AWESOME self only buff that would give us a way to do some damage to casters that we don't have enough offensive skill to hit such as Vellious dragons. When those dragons nuke us they take some damage right back! <BR>As long as we can stay alive we'll be a useful part of the group and not just a source of lag! It should be as unresistable as melee damage shields are currently or possibly unresistable but only to MoBs withing the 6 level limit.<P>Now how do I get the guys at Verant to read the idea?   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As a Paladin of 31 seasons, I cannot speak to the issues of those 50+. It seems there are adequate voices for those issues anyway, with many well-thought posts.<P>I have a few additions, and a couple different suggestions.<P>**Equipment**<BR>1. Absor said, on the other thread, "I don't think one set of armor makes a balance issue." (this was in reference to the DeepWater armor, and the ineffective spell effects on the various pieces). Absor, it is not one set of armor. It is *every* set of Paladin armor, at every stage of our careers. <P>I cannot obtain my Armor of Ro, though I have been trying for levels now. I get stuck on the granite, every time. I simply cannot survive Castle Mistmoore, even in a group of people of similar levels. The only way I may achieve this component is to hope some higher level characters will take pity on me and babysit me long enough to loot a few pieces. On the other hand, I can obtain any piece of crafted I want, at any time, with minimal aid. Others have covered the tedious nature of the components needed for each piece. Crafted is a cake walk in comparison. And I need not ruin my faction with good races, whom I should protect, in order to get the crafted armor.<P>DeepWater armor comparisons and Valorium comparisons have been made before, in cogent posts, and I will not repeat them here. The end result, though, Absor is that our armor is sad at every point in our lives. It is not merely one set, it is every set.<P>2. Weapons: I received a Ghoulbane as a legacy from a noble Paladin who left the game, otherwise I could not in good conscience wield it. Verant claims to encourage role play, yet this class-defining weapon, required for our later class-defining weapons, requires us to slay a Knight who has done no wrong. And, it is alone in its field for 1hs weapons for us for many levels. There is no reason to rehash the other posts on the dearth of decent 1hs weapons, except to say that I agree. I also would like to see nice deity/race-specific weapons if possible (the Falchion of the Koada'Vie rots in my bank, it is a useless weapon which I obtained because it seemed the proper thing for a High Elf Paladin to do).<P>3. Shields: Again, many of us see a Knight in Shining Armor, complete with sword and shield, when envision a Paladin. The shield serves as added armor and also aids us in interrupting casters, with a bit of gratuitous damage thrown in. We need more of them, with effects like other classes receive for their offhand weapons or range weapons (not comparable of course to those special weapons for those classes by any means, but similar in balance to objects casters can hold in otherwise unused slots perhaps). As above, some more deity/race-specific variety would be welcome as well.<P>**Abilities**<BR>1. Offense/Defense: Many good posts on this balance issue. I tend to side with those who would increase our defensive capabilities to be on a par with warriors, and a modest increase in offense to allow us to wield weapons effectively seems in order as well.<P>2. Lay On Hands: "Their greatest skill is Laying of Hands, which can only be used once per day, but will heal a character completely." That is a direct quote from the Official Player's Guide. When did Verant lose that Vision? One complete heal, once an EQ day, does not replace any class in any way. Of course, one Donal's Breastplate can replace one Paladin many times over, if this were truly to be our class-defining ability. And it will not take a slot in a group either.<P>**New Proposed Abilities**<P>I have a few suggestions, based on my knowledge of historical and fantasy-genre Knights:<P>1. Shield Snatch: This skill would require a shield be equipped. The purpose of the maneuver is to foul your opponent's shield/defense with your own shield, to allow easier infliction of damage on the foe. When successful, the Paladin's own shield would be unavailable for the duration of the snatch (no ac, no bash, etc.). The target's defense and ac would be similarly reduced, so that blows landing on the target landed a bit better and did greater damage.<P>2. Rally: A Paladin is a forceful being, beloved by her deity. This skill/discipline would allow her to rally her group mates in the face of danger, raising their morale and giving them the courage to face the battle. It would act as a group-effect Resist Fear of some nature (or some suitable group resist bonus), with perhaps a small atk boost thrown in, for the duration. It could even be further enhanced depending on the deity the Paladin follows (additional small damage shield versus undead for Rodcet Nife, for example).<P>3. Call Deity: Paladins are dedicated servants of their gods, and are given certain special abilities to reflect that special relationship. Perhaps that can be expanded on in some fasion, allowing them to call on their deity once a day for some form of aid. This could be something that got better with levels (e.g., at 1-9, you received a small heal of some sort; 10-19, a lower-level clerical dd spell would hit your current foe; etc.). I am not speaking of the deity themself coming to your aid, or the granting of some super-powered ability, just a small showing of the gods' love that could prove useful. These could again be tailored to the deity served.<P>That was all I could think of for the moment, and I thank each of you who have taken the time to post thoughtful ideas and read what others have had to say.<P>Lyriel delaForet<BR>Knight of the Light Conclave and Paladin of Tunare<BR>Xegony <BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor here is one of the biggest problems with the paladin class balance issue.  Concerning weapons, say 2 handed blunt for example, of the top 14 known weapons the 6 best are all monk only.  Of the total 14 best known 8 are monk only and 13 of the 14 are monk useable, none are pally only.  Now I admit that monks tend to use staffs according to tradition and so they should have a good selection.  But since they are the 2nd best melee class for damage and they have an internal natural haste they don't need the top 6 all to themselves.<P>Another thing is that clerics are getting better 1 handed weapons than pallys now also, they have a 1 handed epic we don't, they also have drops like the dawnfire which was uber before kunark and now they have sacrifice which has better stats than the sword of morning.  Since pallys don't have the offensive skills and abilities as warriors they should be getting better weapons to compensate for the amount they miss and the lower attack they have.<P>For 2 handed slash weapons it looks alot better.  However, the better weapons are so rare for pallys that you rarely ever see them even on pallys in elite guilds.<P>1 handed blunt pallys have  a few weapons up there but only really 2 that are any decent (water sprinkler and rod of faith).  Sprinkler is garbage 54+ (50+ imo) and rod of faith practically doesn't even exist (there isn't even 1 on my server).  So 2 weapons for high level pallys but 1 becomes weak at mid 50s and the other never drops, that equals zero high level uber 1 handed blunt weapons.  There is also the stave of shielding but it's more rare than sword of morning and it is SK monk useable also which makes it even harder to obtain.<P>For 1 handed slash pallys have the sword of morning, zephyrwind, and halcyon broadsword.  All 3 are fairly decent high level weapons.  However, the sword of morning as many have said is very rare and very costly, I was fortunate to loot one.  As for the halcyon broadsword well I farmed that for 6 weeks straight and never saw it.  As for the zephyrwind I've been doing sky raids since the 2nd week the plane opened (was there before levi was nerfed, that was fun).  I've been up to the 8th island killed sister of spire all that junk and I'm still missing the sphinxian claw.  For the 2 new expansions since sky opened the risk vs reward for plane of sky quests is outright pittifull.  There isn't 1 single zephyrwind on my server either.  So basically the 3 nice 1 handed slash weapons pallys are able to get is really just 1 compared to duel weilders having around 13.  There's supposedly a new 1hs that drops in necropolis or western wastes that is pally/sk only with 24dmg 30dly but that's gonna be just like zephyrwind I bet, nice and scarce.<P>I see pure melee only 1 handed weapons with stats like 13dmg 22dly and 12dmg 20dly and stuff like that and it puts anything a pally can ever get to shame.  If duel weilders are getting 1 handed weapons like that then pallys and SKs should be getting 1 handers with stats like 20dmg 28dly.<P>Give pallys better weapons and fix the drop rates on the ones we do have.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm reposting this here just in case you have stopped reading the previous thread.<P>**************************************************<P>I'll agree that at first glance the Paladin class looks like it should have higher AC (as a defensive hybrid) when compared to a Ranger (the offensive hybrid) but I just don't think it pans out the way its expected to (this is assuming the changes in skill caps on Test goes live).<P>Part of the reason is that there just isn't the huge disparity between the AC provided by Paladin armor (Deepwater) vs. what is provided by Ranger armor (Tolan's) like there is comparing the Warrior armor (Cobalt) to the Paladin Armor.<P>Here are the stats for the various pieces in the sets (completely ignoring the spell effects):<P>Cobalt Boots:		25AC<BR>Cobalt Bracer:		20AC x2 40AC <BR>Cobalt Breastplate:	45AC 12Str 12Sta 12Dex 50HP<BR>Cobalt Gauntlets:	25AC<BR>Cobalt Greaves:		35AC 8Str 8Sta 8Dex<BR>Cobalt Helm:		25AC<BR>Cobalt Vambraces:	25AC<P>Total: 220AC 20Str 20Sta 20Dex 50HP<P><BR>Deepwater Boots:	21AC<BR>Deepwater Bracer:	16AC x2 32AC<BR>Deepwater Breastplate:	40AC 10Str 10Wis 50Mana<BR>Deepwater Gauntlets:	16AC<BR>Deepwater Greaves:	26AC 8Str 8Dex 50HP<BR>Deepwater Helm:		21AC<BR>Deepwater Vambraces:	21AC<P>Total: 177AC 18Str 8Dex 10Wis 50Mana 50HP<P><BR>Tolan's Boots:		18AC<BR>Tolan's Bracer:		14AC x2 28AC<BR>Tolan's Breastplate:	35AC 10Str 10Agi 10Dex 10Wis<BR>Tolan's Gauntlets:	14AC <BR>Tolan's Greaves:	24AC 8Str 8Agi 8Dex 8Wis<BR>Tolan's Helm:		18AC<BR>Tolan's Vambraces:	18AC<P>Total: 159AC 18Str 18Agi 18Dex 18Wis<P><BR>That gives a difference 43AC between the Cobalt and Deepwater but only a difference of 18AC between the Paladin and Ranger AC. Assuming you get 1.5AC per point of raw AC on the equipment (which is close to what people get) that makes the differences around 64AC Warrior vs. Paladin and 27AC Paladin vs. Ranger. I'm also ignoring the 3 or so AC from the 18Agi added with the Tolan's armor.<P>Both of the hybrid classes also have self-buffs to enhance their AC values. The best/only self-buff for a paladin is currently Yaulp-III (lvl 56), which would add 12AC to the paladins total. All of the other buffs are sharable / lower level versions of clerical spells (I'll ignore them for the sake of this arguement since they are sharable). Rangers on the other hand have the following self-only buffs to increase their AC: Call of Earth (lvl 50) which would add around 24AC to their total plus Thorncoat which would also add around 32AC. Both of those are self-only and I'll ignore the "Skin like line" (lower level Druid buff which isn't self-only) for the same reasons I ignored the sharable buffs above within the Paladin spell line.<P>These self-only buffs allow a ranger to add around an extra 56AC to their total AC whereas the Paladin would only be able to add 12AC to their total. After Equipment + Self-only buffs, the ranger is actually ahead by 17AC. The only way a Paladin makes up for this is through the higher Defense skill. Paladins do not get self-only buffs to raise Attack to bring them closer to Rangers/Warriors either. So, while Rangers get a couple of really nice spells to help offset their weakness (defense), Paladins do not get any spells to offset theirs (offense).<P>So, for the loss of Dual Wield, lower Offense and Weapon Skill caps the Paladin class gets a lower AC rating compared to Warriors in contrast to Rangers who get the Same Weapons Skills, Same Offensive skill, but only a lower Defense Skill compared to Warriors. I guess what I'm getting at is that I just don't see the parity here. I know that Paladins / Shadowknights have higher Offense and Weapon Skills than Rangers do Defense, but we take the same hit in overall Offense that they take in Defense because of having lower Offense and lower Weapon Skills. I'm currently unsure of what you guys are thinking of doing with regards to the other melee skill caps for hybrids (dodge, parry, reposte) but they'll have to be factored into all of this as well.<P>You said that Rangers should be the offensive side of the "Warrior coin" and Paladins/SK's the Defensive side. The defensive side still seems much weaker in comparison than the offensive side is. This is not even considering that Rangers get a good offensive discipline with Trueshot as well as a defensive discipline. Paladins and Shadowknights truly do get "flavor" disciplines which simply are not of the quality offensively or defensively as the Ranger disciplines. <P>To balance these things out, I'd suggest the following (hopefully, these ideas would be fairly simple to test out and implement), these suggestions are in no order of importance either:<P>1. Increase the AC values of Paladin/Shadowknight armors. If not to the same level as Warrior Armor then close to it. This would match the offensive parity Rangers will have with Warriors (via skill caps and weapons) by providing Paladins with nearly the same defensive parity (we'll still have lower Hps, lower parry / dodge / repoiste skills). This would just match our Armors and Defensive skills the same way Rangers do with weapons, Weapon Skills, and Offense.<P>2. Move Yaulp-III to an earlier spell level and add Yaulp-IV at around level 56. Yaulp-IV only adds 15AC but it also adds 31 Attack. This would reflect the self-buffs of Rangers which would still add more AC than the self-buffs of Paladins but paladins would finally be able to increase their attack rating via spells.<P>3. Add either an Attack bonus to Divine Might or add another self-only AC buff (or Attack depending on how you want to shape the class) to the high level spell list.<P>4. Give Paladins / Shadowknights a defensive based discipline at high levels comparable to the usefullness of Trueshot for Rangers. There have been a number of suggestions listed in this thread - I'll avoid repeating them all here.<P>5. Consider upping the HPs provided by Divine Strenth or add a decent AC component to it so that it is comparable to the Ranger buffs of Strength of Nature and Call of the Predator. Making it equal in power to two spells might be too much, you could add another group buff that adds a smaller amount of HPs (75ish) and around 30AC which would be comparable to Strength of Nature.<P>************<BR>On another note, you made a reply to me regarding our piercing skill previously and I just wanted to clarify what I was thinking before. Since most of our piercing weapons are 2 handers (there are a few one handers but they're not very good for anything other than using to train with) there might not be a real need for a 2H piercing skill. The only reason I could see for it is if 2H piercers do not receive the same 2H bonus that 2H Slash / Blunt weapons do. Otherwise, you can just limit the piercing weapons we can use the same way you currently are and balance them to perform the way you intend them to.<P>As far as the skill cap value being the same as 1H - 2H Slash / Blunt skill caps, I don't see the point of adding alot of piercing weapons for us to use unless the skill caps are the same. Maybe as low or mid-level weapons it'd be alright since you haven't hit a cap in the skill but at high levels they'd be bad weapons since Paladins already have low Offense and Weapon Skills in general. If our piercing skill capped lower than the other skills then it'd be pointless to use a high-end lance instead of a high-end 2 Handed sword even if they had the exact same stats simply because of having lower skill caps. <P>Anyways, I don't even know if this is the situation which is why I asked if you would look into it. If piercing does cap lower, then raising it to cap at the same level should be considered. If it already caps at the same levels as our other weapon skills then simply ignore everything that I mentioned about it.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P><BR>Thanks for all the time you're spending with these talks in general.<P>Kleitus<BR>52nd Level Deepwater Knight of Erudin<BR>Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Im only 45th level but here are my two bits.<P>2Handed Piercing. Who came up with this one? A lance is either held in an overhand position to stab down over shield walls [aka early Normans] or held couched under the right arm for head to head combat, but both with a shield. So toss this one. silly no doubt.<P>Undead Only? What gives with paladins only getting 'versus' undead spells. I thought we were the good guys. Are undead really all that bad compared to say the minions of Mistmoore or the popualce of Cazic-Thule? I though maybe it should be considered a faction based plus undead option. That would include races that follow Innoruuk,Cazic-Thule or Miragul? Evil comes in many forms, not just undead.<P>Summon Pets: Those posts above that mentioned the Summon Squire or Summon Warsteed have a cool idea. This might make pallies a little more popular with those that shun us for oour lack of skills. Not to mention we'd have some one to talk to while constantly soloing)<P>Gate to Temple: Blessed be Tunare. This would be sweet. This would save not only cash but time. But would we have it gate to our diety's temple or ANY paladin temple?<P>Bash: Harder, faster, double &/or critical bashes. I fight in RL with sword and shields [yes I'm one of those loonies] and a shield not only be used to assail an opponent with but you may also block with it. Usually this block causes the sword weilder to be stunned due to loosing his grip on his weapon.<P>Graphics: We all look alike. Plain and simple, Paladins. The Human tin-can look has to go. The dwarfs are no different from any other dwarf. The High Elf pallys wear a neo-Romano helm with mail /plate graphics tied in, simply not nice to look at. Too bad there isnt a way to gain a smithing skill that allows one to choose from a few set graphics like the Dwarf guards Helm or the High Elf Sentry's helms and forge a new look with a pattern and moderate cost. It could work for ugly items like the Treeweave and the 3-4 different shield graphics we all carry.<P>Kick? I have two feet. Why can't I? It isn't honourable to kick? Sorry, there is no honour when fighting evil...<P>Like others have stated; split the uber weapons effects and bonuses into sword and shield effects.<P>And let us not forget the little paladin on the streets. Possibly more PAL only armour, weapons or COMPLETABLE quests for them?<P>Angernath Helstorm, stuck in level 45 too long ;~)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'd like to suggest a discipline/skill/spell that would make paladins useful in the big mob raid situation.<P>Call it "rage of the almighty" "divine rage" "holy purpose" or something like that.<P>You target the mob in question, turn it on, and it lasts for 30 seconds or however long will be balancing.  During this time, all attacks made by the paladin would be successful, and (possibly) no spells would be resisted (add or subtract attack bonuses to taste).  But here's the catch, at the end of 30 seconds, if the mob has not died, the paladin dies.  If the mob dies in that 30 seconds, the paladin lives.  Kind of a last push attack.  It would probably work best as a discipline so it wouldn't recycle after every death like lay hands, although I think disciplines in general are kinda clunky how they have to be started with a command line.<P>The death of the paladin would have to be without fail, no death pact or anything stopping it short of the targetted mob's death.<P>It's kind of a "you or me" type of thing.  Pretty paladin-ish if you ask me, and allows paladins to become more like a pure class more than a toned down version of others for that 30 seconds.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>maybe I misinterpreted your response<P>I pointed out that a Paladin may have strong ethical problems getting a Ghuolbane and thus his epic weapon<P>I believe your response was that a truly noble knight would not be so concerned with a sword<P>Does that mean you believe that people who rolepay their paladins in such a manner should accept second rate equipment and be left out of their classes epic quest or were you slyly hinting their is a way around it ?<P>I truly hope it is the second, though the cousin of hope (fear) leads me to the first.

On paladin boards I have actually seen some people  theorize that Verant is trying to show how paladins only care about there gods and its followers and are using these quests as a "teaching tool". Surely they must be mistaken, I do not believe you would force your rp view on others.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>jeez looking at all those words is distracting to say the least so I will make my requests simple and capitolized, and the reasoning behind them below.<P><BR>1. ADD A DAMAGE BONUS FOR 1HS SIMILAR TO 2HS<BR>2. RAISE BASH SKILL LEVEL TO MAX<BR>3. ADD CRITICAL HITS FOR BASH<BR>4. ADD MORE 1 HANDED WEAPONS WITH DAM/DEL NEARLY COMPARABLE TO 2 HANDED WEAPONS FOR PALADINS AND SHADOW KNIGHTS ONLY<BR>5. RAISE TAUNT SKILL<P>1. Currently one handed weapons are nearly useless for paladins, this is because we simply cannot do nearly as much damage with them.  Two handed weapons have a damage bonus, add this damage bonus for one handed weapons.<BR>2. Paladins and shadow knights are in a class by themselves, we cannot be treated like other classes.  Because we are the only melee classes that are known exclusivle for using shields our bash skill should be raised to at least that of warriors.<BR>3. Critical hits for bash would be another insentive for using one handed weapons, there is no way this could unbalance any damage tables as everyone knows critical hits are seen as a small bonus to over damage.<BR>4. Paladins and shadow knights need a different kind of one handed weapons since our position is unique.  More higher damage one handed weapons that only paladins or shadowknights can use.<BR>5.  If any of the previous upgrades to one handed weapons or shields is implemented we need our taunt skill raised do to the fact that taunting with a one handed weapon is significantly less efficient then taunting with a two handed weapon.  It is hard to keep mobs on me with one handed weapons, which defeats the point of the shield which is to raise our armor class.<P><BR>SUMMARY: You have put paladins and shadow knights in a position where using a one handed weapon is counter productive in all cases. Allow us to do enough damage and taunt enough to keep tanking when using a shield.<P>thankyou</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I keep seeing the request for bash critical hits, yet I believe that if it is a damage dealing critical, it will be negligable.  What I propose is a bash "critical" that is more along the lines of "knock them silly".  It would be an extended stun (5-10sec) that would be effective against almost any mob.<P><BR>I would also like to add to my earlier comment that Paladins should get Panic the Dead.  We already get Spook the Dead at a very early level, and this is one of the only spells that we never get an upgrade to, why?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Thoughts on 2 things that keep popping up:<P>Rez<BR>---<P>We should NOT have it.  We definitely shouldn't get the full cleric line.  People are asking for it, but I don't understand why.<P>I think most of us started a paladin because we liked the idea of a holy WARRIOR.  The more buffs/heals/rezes we get, the more we become like clerics and less like warriors.  I don't believe these are the spell areas that Verant should focus in, for paladins.<P><BR>Smite line of spells<BR>--------------------<P>Again, we don't want it.  People are asking for it, but I see this as an act of desparation, to be honest.<P>At the core, if you're asking for smite you're asking for more damage output.  Which means you think our offensive abilities are unbalanced.  So fix our offensive abilities.  Maybe if we hit more than half the time, and didn't do minimum damage so often, we'd be considered a viable option as a tank (instead of a black hole where all the cleric's mana goes).<P>Besides, smite gets resisted.  Swords don't.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I only have 2 things I feel that could be improved.<P>1. Paladin Epic Quest<BR>2. Post 50 poor offensive power<P>Paladin Epic Quest<BR>I personally have been on 35 succesful dragon raids in the past 8 months. 21 on Naggy and 14 on Vox. Out of all those raids, I have seen Naggy drop 2 Paladin epic books and have still to see Vox drop a book.<P>Maybe a possible solution would be to make *all* epics on a triggered spawn set up, or put the epic items on epic item specific mobs. <P>I am not saying make things super easy, but take the paladin epic, 2 rare drops of 7 day spawns and compair it to the shaman epic that can and HAS been completed in less than 12 hours total(the shaman had already completed the leg work and had killed the black dire in MM).<P>Is the shaman epic easier? I do not think it is. The hole is rough no matter what level you are and Lord rak's 2000hp fire AE is rough.<P>The reason it can be completed more easily than the paladin epic is that the mobs involved always drop the items needed (always may not be right, I should say I have never seem them not drop the items). The rarest part is the iskar broodling in Fear. Kill the golems to get it to spawn. They are a 14 hour spawn (I believe).<P>Both of those quests are hard to complete, but compair 12 hours to 8 months, something is wrong.<P>Post 50 offensive power<BR>I am not sure how this could be fixed, but I saw a lvl 55 paladin (wielding a DarkMetal Holy Sprinkler and Trueheart Shield w/ FBSS) get KSed by a 39 Rogue (wielding a Trak Tooth and Burning rapier(I believe) with Hangman's noose). Both of the people are friends of mine and were playing around with each other killing Mammoths in Eastern Wastes. The Rogue ended up getting 2 out of 3 of the kills. Again I am unsure of how this could be addressed, but it certainly needs to be.<P>Swiftlion<BR>Paladin 52 for life</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think in addition to the changes on test currently, 4 things need to happen for paladins:<P>1) Need a raid usable discipline (possibly something call sacrifice that allows you to absorb someone else's damage, possibly a bash that will stun 55+ mobs, etc)<BR>2) Bash cap should be 252 for Paladins and SK's.  We are the only ones that use shields.  This will have very little impact on actual damage but may allow more spell interrupts.<BR>3) Need more 1h blunt and shield choices post 50.  Currently they are scarce and underpowered.<BR>4) Stacking problems with Ranger buffs fixed.  Divine Strength and Divine Might should not get over-ridden by Strength of Nature.<P>Would like to see:<P>Increase to 1h and 2h slash caps.  Paladins are hurting for damage, this will help some.  Maybe increase 2h slash and 1h blunt for Sk's.<P>Gorannon<BR>Level 58 Knight<BR>Saryrn Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Skip this one Alan, I need to /bonk some people again...Sorry for lengthening this thread without really contributing...<P>Okay, regarding the FD to 1HS/Shield idea, look friend, go count the number of epic weapons out there that every other class has. See how long it takes you to find a rogue with his Ragebringer, or an Enchanter with his Shissar Staff (or whatever it's called), or a warrior with his fancy-dancy lightsabers. (Oh admit it, that's what they are!) I can barely walk through the EC tunnel without tripping over two or three people with their epics.<P>Now, find a paladin with a Fiery Avenger or a Fiery Defender.<P>Go ahead.<P>..........................................<P>I'm waiting...<P>Okay time's up. There aren't that many. Average it out. Five per server? Ten per server at the absolute most? Now, what's wrong here? Oh yeah! The Fiery Avenger quest is *eight months older* than the rest of the epic quests! Other classes can complete their epics with extreme ease compared to paladins. All you need is the firepower and the luck to catch a rare spawn. What do we need? We need a very rare book from not one, but two dragons. If you weren't lucky or patient enough to spend six months at level 52 for Naggy and Vox, you get to go after Kunark dragons. Gorenaire and Severilious are too stinking hard for all but the biggest uberguilds in the world, and even then, paladins still need to get supremely lucky for a book to drop.<P>The point is that true, epic weapons aren't for everyone. However, considering the total amount of effort and time and sacrafice that many, MANY paladins out there have put up with, our epic weapons are currently too insanely rare. (Okay, mages, I understand their quest is hard too, but sheesh, their hardest part is killing a flying horse...) I never said I was opposed to a quest which would turn the FD into a 1HS, but give another option to those paladins who literally can't spend their entire real lives waiting for the books to drop. We never said we didn't want to put out the effort, but good grief, the quest as it currently stands is unacceptable. We play this game to have fun, not to be forced to never level while our friends and guild members pass us by, and get more effective epic weapons more easily to boot. As a matter of fact, one of those paladins going on the PoA raid for his Fiery Avenger tonight is going to be semi-retiring his paladin because he is sick of playing the class! I guess spending six months working on one quest will do that to anyone...<P>Okay, now, everybody, start posting new, unique, and useful paladin improvement ideas! And....GO!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Has anyone played FF2?  if so don't you think that Cecil is the ideal of what a pally should be?<P>I think that is how pallys should be in everquest but then warriors would be mad.  I think Blizzard portrays paladins extremely well also in warcraft 2 and diablo 2 (although the pally in D2 seemed more like a bard with his group auras).  Verant should take some ideas from there.<P>Blizzard portrays a paladin as a modified/improved knight and the knights are the best fighters.  So paladins are even better fighters with the ability to cast spells or magical auras.  Paladins use white magic, there is nothing in particularly special that they have against undead so there is no reason why all their nukes should be vs undead either.  They fight evil not just undead, this is one thing holding the class back from it's potential.  Paladins are not necessarilly defence they are crusaders like Richard the Lion Heart's crusades.  They all weren't a bunch of wimps who couldn't fight but they sure could tank cause you can't win crusades that way.  They were exellent fighters (they weren't really paladins but bear with me).<P>Verant got the idea of paladins being defensive in nature because they are holy knights and therefore protectors of all that is good.  They are dragon slayers etc.  They are crusaders mighty fighters make their enemies flee in fear or they crush them.  Pallys are not guards that are only good for defending city walls like verant portrays them and that is why they have no use in everquest.  But verant can't make paladins what they should be because they don't know how to keep warriors and some of the other classes balanced with that.<P>I like how Tolkien portrays many of the characters also. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR># 1. Big Raid Discipline- problem at higher levels. Defensive would be ideal. Failing that a lower version of Defensive or (god forbid) an offensive one. Any would be fine. #<P>I still like the idea mentioned earlier (in the Thread That Poofed) about a "group Yaulp" spell, of reasonably short casting time AND duration, that caused some SIGNIFICANT increase in the effectiveness of all party members (not just melee types).<P>The RP idea, which makes perfect sense for the Holy Knight class, is that having a gung-ho crusader devoted to a holy cause in the group would get everyone fired up and cause them to redouble their efforts, as he spurred them on to give their all for the crusade against evil (or at least against the current mob  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ).<P>Not only would this be perfectly fitting for the Paladin class (unlike a lot of other "say what?" spells/disciplines that have been tacked on to several classes), but it would be a unique and useful thing that Paladins could bring to a raid, instead of looking to give Paladins just another version of what everybody else has.  More/better healing won't get us a slot in a high-level raid, nor will having damage output that is simply on par (or subpar) for other melee classes.<P>Paladins need something unique to bring to the table (most other classes do, or share a special ability with only one or two other classes).  Currently, Paladins have nothing special to offer, and giving them just more healing/damage/defense/whatever won't make any real difference, unless it's so much more that it becomes unbalancing and thus leaves another class with the short end of the new stick.<P>So how about a "Holy Cause" group buff that increases everyone's effectiveness for a short time, as they are goaded to greater heights by their zealous Paladin companion?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055875-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055875.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055875-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055875-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055875-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055875&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055875&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
