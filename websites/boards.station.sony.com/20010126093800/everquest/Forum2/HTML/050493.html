</FONT><HR> My main char when I played was a druid, and I always looked upon shamans as my brothers of sorts. They, like druids, were very in tune with nature, and we shared some important abilites. We both were the best secondary healers in the game (along with paladins), and we both had SoW. Plus, druids did wolf form with bear pet, and shamans got wolf pet and bear form at some point I think. <BR>   When I last looked around, I saw a bunch of angry shamans (post 50 spells are garbage) and angry druids (getting the old necro ostracizing we-hate-you-and-your-uber-leveling-ways karma from all the other classes).<BR>  So, here is my suggestion: Give shamans one more link to druids. Let them port. Let them use our druid rings. Make them EQUAL to druids in porting ability. Honestly, I don't think druids and wizards would care. At upper levels, the amount of money is negligable, so we would just see it as less people begging to get the ports from us.<BR>  Seeing that you just changed the most unchangeable aspect of the game, why not this? If anyone really stands to lose, it's druids, and I really doubt they'd complain about it.<P>Finally, traveling is VERY inconvenient. The class interdependency argument holds very little water, because 3 out of I think 16 (if my memory serves me right) classes being able to port still promotes interdependency on a large scale. All it does is lessen travel time for shamans, give better chances for a port to the rest, and decreases the begging for the druids. Everyone is happy.<BR>Works for me.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>How exactly would it help shaman?<P>Would it stop the fact that their best spells are being given away to other classes?<P>No, in fact it just makes them look like hypocrites since they're taking a spell line from another class.<P>Does it make them better healers?<P>No, not at all.<P>Is it something shaman would want, but in fact don't NEED nor even have a good reason for needing except "I see no downside to it"?<P>As a Wizard I've got teleports. They're amazing in reducing travel time, but to tell you the truth they're not good for much else. Especially with people preffering getting rezzed instead of evac'ed.<P>So please don't beg for pretty much useless stuff that's just an accessory to a class (which, don't get me wrong, IS nice to have).<P>On a seperate topic, how would it hurt the game to give Wizards a self only clarity?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alright, I was going to throw my own sarcastic reply into the mix as well, but it seems there's plenty of sarcasm already, and Absor asked us to be nice.  Won't hurt, so here goes.<P>I disagree with your opinion of giving teleports to the Shaman class.<P>You said:  "My main char when I played was a druid, and I always looked upon shamans as my brothers of sorts. They, like druids, were very in tune with nature, and we shared some important abilites."  This is true.  Secondary healing, Wisdom-based Classes, the nature-closeness thing, Spirit of Wolf, similar spell lines, Bears and Wolves (whether forms or pets)...  both the Shaman and Druid classes have these.  However, if you were to give the Shaman class teleports, you'd be adding a grey area.  Right now, someone (anyone) can look at the fourteen (minor correction:  You had said sixteen) classes and notice a distinct separation between all of them.  Monks and Warriors are similar.  They're not the same though.  They share some skills, but not all.  Same with the Druids and Shamen (Shamans?  Shaman?  I don't know the plural):  if they get too many similarities, people will start going "Druid, Shaman...  same thing."  And in effect, EverQuest will have lost a class.  Not good.<P>Sure, teleporting would make Shamen (I've just decided to use that one) happy.  There are plenty of things that would please Shamen, but far fewer to balance and to fix them.  Please, let's leave the proposed additions to Shamen to Absor's Talk Sessions about the classes.<P>Certainly travel is tedious for the classes that cannot teleport.  I imagine it gets that way for the folks that CAN teleport, too  (coughgettingtoQeynoscough) sometimes.  Really, though, another teleporting class isn't the answer.  Do what I do:  Stop worrying about the time needed to travel.  Don't min-max your playing time with "Must level must level must LEVEL!" frenzy.  Chalk some of it up to sightseeing.  Look around.  See if any of the zone's rare spawns are up.  Run in dread from that big ol' cyclops.  Oh wait...  that last one is just for me, because I'm a level 24 Ranger.  They'd use me as a pine-scented toothpick.  Either way, don't look at travel as a chore (though it sometimes is.  Corpse recovery comes to mind).  Think of it as played time.  Time playing a game.<P>Well, there it was.  My attempt at a non-sarcastic, conversational, and hopefully informative reply to an issue I felt needed addressing.<P>Corlian Ranshire<BR>Ranger of Karana</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
