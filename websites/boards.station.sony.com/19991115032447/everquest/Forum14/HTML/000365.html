</FONT><HR>As for the new patch it sucks. I do not play a shaman, but know they will be affected to this ludicrous change being made to the dot spell. As for the mighty druids-haha lol . I have played every class and have come to love and stand by my druid, but now since verant obviously is making bad choices and decisions for their gamers, i can tewll you there will be some fine fine stuff at this friday's bazzar on bertloxxous. So let me get this straight, you weaken our dot spells beyond beluef, ok how does a druid fight then? ignite-lol wind,lightning-lol you boys and girls at verant have to have a good reason for this. What because some candy ass thinks its unfair? Thats the way these things are, i warrior tanks, a wizard nukes, and so forth. A druid cannot survive, or actually they could but would be no fun to play. Unless you have no life and dont mnd spending hours ond days on end putting up with a druid there is no sense in playing, so what you get sow and teleport,,, you ever try to fight with a druid in combat? they suck, i mean they really suck, for 18 levels you expect us to survive with ignite, a whoppin 35 damage! You get the dot stinging swarm, but hey what good is that now? It was stated that this really wont effect druids in groups,, what about those of us who like to solo? And for the mother f'rs who say this is a grouped based game,,did it say that on the box? I group 75% of the time, but wghat about when i want to solo? guess i just have to sit in town and play with the crummy trade skills they provide that do nothing but sap money. If you wanted to change the dot, you should have atleast read the 1000"s of letters that just said to make it so we can't kite reds and yellows,, meaning have them resiswt, how hard is that to do? But no you destroy the druid class and the shaman class. Hmm i can gues, just a guess but there will probabaly be far less druids and shamans, i know when the server goes back up biship will be lsited as a bard for now on, atleast with that class i dont see you bothcing that one for awhile. The biggest reason this change came about was ppl complained it was unfair,so what lifes like that,,,take it in stride, every class has strenghts and weaknesses, for the druid and shaman, it was our dot that helped us survive,, and now you have killed 2 classes with one stone  for that feat you should rethink your MISTAKE. I didnt post this to rant and rave, just voice which most have already done, you have made a great mistake, in time you will see it will have great drawbacks,,, but hey you can laways fix those mistakes, but at the rate you ppl go, dont see it happening. Aslo wanted to address this,, soloing, yopu have litterally crippled a solo druid or shaman,,i like to solo sometimes and i know others who like to, so what we dont like to group sometimes,, you have crippled this type of play with your new ideas,, think about that one please .  <BR>            And as i stated in the header webtroll,, it seems that you have a problem with the druid class and shaman class, or any class that has a step on another, dont get me wrong  i am not bashing, i just dont want to come back and see one of your negative remarks. So just read it for the content as ones view, i didnt bash verant, i used CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM so please no remarks that look harsh.<P>Biship former druid of the 18th rank bert server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Less mana overall and more Damage!   I work best in a group but I am STILL able to solo if needed.   Think Druids will now have to start working in a group setting.  They still are powerful just no alone, just in a group.

</FONT><HR>  I play an 18th lvl shaman.  I've tried kiting (blue griff) and ended up running for the guards.  I haven't played since the patch but it looks just fine to me.  I solo a fair bit, group a fair bit, and belong to a guild so I'm looking at this from most points of view other than as a kiter.  <P>  When I group, I often volunteer to be the lure.  I can re-SOW myself if I need and I have armor enough to handle myself.  I use a DOT to get the mob's attention then lead it back to my group.  As long as it doesn't take me more than 18 seconds to get back to my group, the DOT does as much or more damage than before.  Even if it does take me more than 18 seconds, the mob comes back already damaged...most people I've grouped with consider that to be a GOOD THING [tm].  And that way, the DOT has longer to work even if we kill the mob before the spell expires.<P>  When I solo, I do much the same except instead of leading the mob to my group I lead it to my chosen battleground.  Again, it's generally less than 18 seconds so the spell will be doing as much or more damage as pre-patch.  If I have enough of a lead I'll root it then stack another DOT then hit it with some debuffs and/or DD's, and finally, hopefully, melee it to death.<P>  I don't see anything in the DOT change that will hurt this kind of style of play.  The only style it will really hurt is the hard-core kiters.  The ones that rely on DOT for doing most or all of the damage to the mob.  <P>  As for how does a druid fight?  We have a couple in my guild and I've been fortunate to find a few that I've teamed up with.  Druids and shamans are great in a fight as long as you realize a few important things; you have mana AND hitpoints, use 'em both.  You have healing spells so you can recover lost hitpoints after a battle much, much, much more quickly than any tank.  You have DD and DOT and buff/debuff and shielding spells.  <P>  If you've been so one-dimensional with your character as to think that a change to make kiting less effective has destroyed your character then I feel for you.  Just don't lump us shamans in with you...we'll continue to play and have fun.<P>Alise</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>As far as grouping goes?  Why should I be forced into this?  I group most of the time, but I do like to solo.  Basically a reason I picked a druid and gave up my cleric.  NO WHERE DOES IT SAY THAT I HAVE TO GROUP!  NO WHERE DOES IT SAY THAT YOU HAVE TO PLAY A DRUID AND KITE.  NO WHERE DOES IT SAY YOU HAVE TO SOLO.  I wish they would of just left things alone and fixed things that are much much more important in the aspect of gameplay.  I thought this was a roleplaying game.  Where is the roleplay?  A rogue cant act as a rogue?  They are supposed to be of a stealing sort.  I think is time to pull out the old D&D books and get back to what roleplaying is about.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>  S'ok chicago, the arguments on the other side are all the same too.  Not that the arguments are specific or have much of any substance.  I didn't like the idea of any more changes to the DOT spells (check the shaman board at www.soerbaird.com if you want to see shamans getting upset at DOT changes) than anyone else...but this is one I can live with.<P>  People who want can still kite.  It may be more time consuming and mana-inefficient than before but it's still a viable tactic.  The change mainly means that those who do kite with DOTs won't be able to take reds and yellows without risk.  I'm just not too sure I can work up much pity for folks who claim that this means that an entire class has been destroyed.<P>Alise</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I have read and rad about this patch and all of the problems that it supposedly causes. My druid just made 14 the night before the pacth was put in, so I never got to kite. But then Im basically lazy and dont like to run around a lot,so I probably wouldnt kite much anyway.  I have been friends with you, Bishipp since Drakkar, before EQ was released. And I will continue to be friends with you, but you know that I play differently from you, I spend over half of my playing time helping other ppl, Ive evn run across 2 zones wiht somebody to show them where their guild is. That doesnt make me a better player than anybody, just different. Im only lvl 14 so I dont know about later, but for now, I will continue to play my Druid as my main Char.  <P>I played all morning today with my druid and did'nt notice any difference in my abilities, but, then Ive never kited so I dont know how.  I will continue to play my Druid until it is no longer possible for me to solo, and no-one will group with me. I understand this is a problem with druids in their 30s.  Hopefully, verant will make some changes to the class to make it more palatable for other players to group with them in the higher lvls.  With the way I play, it will take me a long time to find out.  I am hoping they do make some changes in that direction.<P>It is my opinion that the change they made to DoT spells has crippled, but notkilled the class, but thats for my style of play, not everyones, and for some this HAS killed it, including you. For that reason I Am angry and think that Verant killed a gnat with a sledgehammer,  but I dont know if they will see all of the pposts and try to improve the classes they have hurt.

You need a dedicated tank.  Enchanter for crowd control and Clarity (PLEASE!!!).  Bard so healing during down time doesn't suck the cleric's mana...keep it for the emergency heals so the cleric can help tank instead of medding during battle.  Druid and shaman for a little bit of everything, including the emergency teleport.<P>  Oh and Bishipp, thanks for being confident enough in yourself to say those three words..."I was wrong".

</FONT><HR>Hate to break it to you, but I play a shaman 21st level. This patch made me even better. Now my DoT does some noticable damage. Before, I just whacked it enough that I was never sure I cast a DoT or not.<BR>As for the people that claim Druids now need better armor, that is just bunk. I have compared my AC, stats, damage, attack, and other factors with my friends druid at the same level. She has better base AC (by over 30), better attack (again by about 30), her strikes do about the same as mine, her stats are clearly superior in agility and dex (and she gets hit much less). Overall, she can still take me. Then there is the druid armors which give them even more bonuses. <BR>Granted, yes, some people will be distraught that the changes will force them to use some other tactic than the "flee while damaging" one. Me and my friend just root, dot, dd, root, dd, dd, root, dd, melee, dd, melee..Dead Griffon(Broon, whatever). Add a warrior and caster and things die fast.

Fight is over warrior solo has 1-2 bubbles of HP left. Warrior sits down for a long time to gain HP back to fight a second blue mob. Same thing happens again. Warrir fights a third mob con blue and a buddy jumps in, warrior dies. meanwhile a group of 3 about the same level are killing mobs left and right with little down time and no deaths.

</FONT><HR>Actually I group with druids and shamans who are all level 50 or close to levle 50. We personally *love* the new patch. Now instead of doing 700 damage with his druid dot he does about 900 damage.  Only the kiters got effected and from what I've seen and heard only minimally. Whine all you want but we love the extra damage they gave the grouping dot'ers for free.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum14&number=14&thisthread=000365&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum14&number=14&thisthread=000365&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
