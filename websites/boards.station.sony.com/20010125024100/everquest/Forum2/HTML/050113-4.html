</FONT><HR>Magicians, as you know, take their lives in their hands anytime they are travelling alone outdoors.  Unlike other casting classes, we can't root, or snare, and usually get beat upon too much to have time to summon a pet.  I recall getting ganked by a raptor running though EJ at lev 55.  There should come a time when high level mages have some recourse for protection.<P>Therefore I suggest that they are allowed to summon an item that can be used to root or snare for the purposes of excape only.  <P>The item could have a single charge, be of short duration, no rent, no drop, lore, outdoors only, could not be summoned concurrently with a pet etc....anything to allow us the ability to slow a mob enough to pull a pet or have a resonable chance to escape.<P>I would love to do more zone exploration, and this would be a very valuable item for me.     </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Mages don't need or want new summons. Especially not the complicated or underpowered ones listed in this thread. What mages need are<P>-Fixed 52&58 fire pets, and fixed dyzil. Take a look at these pets and see how underpowered they are.<BR>-stronger pets in general... the necro pets especially lvl 55 monk pet are darn near our pets in power. Hate to whine about necros, but if you compare our mage pets to their necro pets, and then compare the rest of our spells, it's sad.<BR>-Unique summons. I will not use summon banded armor. No mage being of sound mind would cast that spell. Plus, mages already screw up tinkering and brewing with summons. No need to add smithing. <BR>-Respect. As a mage, I feel insulted almost every time something involving us happens. See the Aegis of Ro thread.<BR>-Easier to obtain spells. I don't have most of my spells. I never will either. It's insulting that magicians are one of the hardest classes to get groups, but need groups to get spells. I don't want to play 10 hours straight LFG/camping OS.<BR>Mana regen- I know you won't have it, but look at some of the other classes. Druid and necros in particular, they get pets, snares, dmg shields,teleports, fears, dots, charms, FD, rez, lifetap, and they both get some form of mana regen. Mages get pets and nukes, and dmg shields. Considerin druids get better nukes, necros get the same amount of pet variety (3 classes of pets, necros get rogue monk and warrior, mages get rogue, crappy wiz, and 2 kinds of warrior) with necro pets being almost as powerful, I think it's fitting that magicians get some form of good mana regen. My personal opinion is that you should re-instate the lvl 52 fire pet bug that allowed for massive mana regaining. My close circle of mages truly believed that was the intended use for the pet, considering how weak and useless it is.<P>That's all for my opinions, now I think I should give a list of summons. These are not in detail and don't call for ridiculous things like "turns into a rabbit after 5 mins, so after that you must summon a loaf of bread and feed it to it"<P>-Summon Fiery Breastplate, effect(auto) FireElemAura AC=0<BR>Summon Clarity Staff- Infinite charges of clarity.<BR>Summon target- summons target, npc or pc<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have been seeing lots of summoned items with cool powers proposed.  I think, with the exceptions already in-game, such as haste muzzles and levitation rings, the items proposed should NOT have abilities not already possessed in some manner by the Mage (or his various pets).<P>If anyone should be getting abilities relating to items with magical properties, the Enchanters should be getting first dibs.  Lord knows they have only been waiting since Beta for them, and stuff like Sword of Runes, Ring of Flight, Imbue Stone and the entire Alchemy skill didn't do much to improve their mood...   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I tried to keep my own 'magical' summons either within the Magician purview already (so no SoW booties, Haste gloves, Healing potions or +25 Strength girdles, Mages aren't meant to replace Druids, Enchanters, Clerics or Shamen) or at least fit them into the idea of a summoned Elemental item that has certain properties (like burning) based on where it was summoned from.<P>It is easy enough to envision a thousand summoned items conferring all sorts of special abilities from other classes that a Mage would want, like Revive Stones or Waters of Clarity or Spades of Corpse Summoning.  As Alan asked, we should avoid too many ideas that, like the (IMO) ill-conceived previous summons, have nothing to do with the Magician class, summoning or the four elements.<BR>(And yes, in that light, the Sword of Runes is fine, since it is a Mage ability it procs.  Ring of Flight is evoking an 'Air' related ability.  Waterstones are 'Water' based, etc.  But a Sword that procs Dismiss Undead or Fear or Charm or some other completely out of character ability would be out of line.  Although a *Charm Summoned* line would certainly make a Mage popular in the Hole...)   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Class interdependancy is not completely broken yet, despite all the shuffling of spells and abilities lately.

</FONT><HR>Scary how many non-magicians posted requests that are completely rediculous and will off-balance the class.  The few posted by people who have high level mages are worth noting.  Unfortunately there is way too much noise from the "1st post" retards...<P>Here is what I thing magicians should be able to summon without off-balancing the class.  Keep in mind we will never get SoW, Teleports, Healing of others, etc.  That will affect other classes and the dynamics of how we all work together.  Summoning items to perform or eliminate another class will not be done.  This is the hard truth.<P>Summon weapons, situational use only.<BR>With balance in mind we need weapons that can be summoned to hand to a pet that are situational. We have sword of runes for summoned beings, what we need is a 1HB with undead proc.  1HS/1HB for cold/fire proc.<P>Summon Ale should be a low level spell as it will be a great social item to hand out summoned ale.  <P>Summon fireworks is also a fun item that we don't need to wait until 52 to get (I guess that would anger the tinkerers out there).<P>Summon armor piece (that many spells for each usable piece that summons an item fitting the level of the mage), increases in stats at 24, 34, 44, 54 as a possible choice.  Also higher level summoned items would have some magical effects, even if something of a minute spell (such a 3 charges of summon food, or some charges of lowest level fire shield, etc).  This may be a complex part, so I am just throwing the idea out.<P>Summon bow to go along with arrows.<P>Summon upgraded throwing knives we can use at higher levels.<P>Summon pet (Call of Elements!).  This is a very useful spell when pathing sends a pet into some strange area of the zone and it cammon find you.  Or when you fall into a trap and the pet gets confused and stays there and will not follow you.  Cast time should be about 10 seconds or so to make it a spell people use when pet is really missing and not to exploit pulls.<P>Summon money bag.  Small conatiner, holds 4 small items (or maybe 2) and reduces the weight of money by some percentage.<P>--------------------<P>Now for some necessary spells that may help.<P>Voice graft type of a spell is very useful and I cannot see why it's necro only.<P>Elemental Vision, where you could see thru your pet's eye(?), different that the Eye of Zomm.  This is useful at times for locating the pet that is lost by seeing where it is running around in. ( Field of Bone is a usual suspect where the pet just poofs and runs from the newbie area to the pit entrance and then pops back to newbie area until you go there and get it, without vision it is almost impossible to guess where the pet is).<P>-------------------------<P>The mage class is unfortunately plagued by too many summoned weapons that are of little use.  Six weapons that I personally summoned once to see what they do and never summoned again, mainly because they are 2HB and I need 1 hand for an int item or a shield.  There should be at least 1 usable 1HB (other than a mod rod of course), that I sould weild that has a nice effect, I simply need my second hand.<P>And finally I'd like to request one, just one, more escape spell that we could use.  Gate is nice and fine but with the cast time it's not an option.  Wizards gets shadow step, younder, fade, etc.  Which they need since they do not have a pet.  Clerics get stun, divine aura, etc and they need it since they don't have invis. Chanters have tons of escape spells, and that is part of their job description.  Mages only have gate and invis to travel.  With velious some classes got improved invis and invis to undead.  We got some silly moster summons spells and DOTs that are pathetic as they are now that offer no advantage of a DD (in mana or damage).  We need at least improved invis or some form of an escape.  Something that works like bind/gate but only valid within the zone and allows to quickly to gate there.  When we leave the zone that marker is erased; and will be self only and 10 or 12 seconds to cast the marker and 1 or 2 seconds to cast the phase-out part.)<P>These are some of many ideas for spells that I felt we needed, as I was going thru almost 56 levels as a magician.  Some may not be feasible in the overall picture, but many will not off-balance the class and provide some usefulness.  In all my levels I have never gotten a tell asking me to group until Call Of Hero... As a mage I am used to being rejected by groups while growing up, something necros can understand I am sure.  So give us more group oriented spells so we are wanted in groups and raids.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>   More summoning-related thoughts I've had in the past...<P>   Up the cap on throwing skill for mages.  Let's face it, this skill means nothing to the outcome of combat.  Might as well let us have some fun with it.  As it is, only monks have any use for the throwing daggers.  Biggest implementation problem -- allowing the skill to train up since so many mages are past the point they can actually hit with it.  Livening up summons doesn't just mean making the items better; it also means getting them into use more.<P>   Nerf Cornucopia/Everfount.  That's right, these two spells are OVERPOWERED and RUIN THE GAME!  Uh, I mean... silly as it seems, I always got a kick out of watching my stacks of knives and bandages grow as I levelled.  Being able to summon 20 bandages at once at 40 -- woo hoo!  Finally!  I was a bit disappointed that these spells summon stacks of 20 right off to bat.  Make it level / 2, like bandages, so you hit stacks of 20 at level 40.  (And let's face it, you'll still get stacks at 12 at level 24 when you get the spell; it's not like it's going to increase your downtime.)  Better yet, let the original food/water spells scale, and make Cornucopia/Everfont into summoned items that satisfy the need for food/water without being consumed.  One of each keeps you online and fed forever (until you camp).  Fits the name better; indeed, that was how they were rumored to work when I started playing.  (Kind of amusing seeing that rumor resurface with the Plains Pebble.)<P>   New item: Charm Bracelet.  Summoned container, wearable on the wrist, that lets multiple rings be worn and have their usual effect at the same time.  (Yes, I said "wrist" and "rings".  You thread the rings on the bracelet, see?)  So I can throw my plat rose quartz ring in there with a ring of flight, and maybe a moonstone ring, and it counts as wearing all three at once.  You'll have to fix the LD problem, of course, or this is even more useless than the existing bags.  At a minimum, it would have to revert to non-magical on LD, so the contents aren't lost, or no one will risk their rings inside.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I don't want to cheat using them, I just want to make them useful for game play.

</FONT><HR>Well this is going to be buried in page 4 or 5, but I'm going to try to put some honest thought into this, so I hope it stil lets read.<P>I have a 55 Magician, and IMHO the biggest drawback of Magicians is lack of group-desirability.  VI has a push for grouping over soloing, so maybe they'll be on board with my general theme.  I shall try NOT to infringe on other classes abilities (reluctantly) or suggest items that are better than in-game drops.<P>To begin - what do groups want?  They want safety and faster kills.  The best night/group is one that doesn't experience deaths and gains a lot of exp in the process.  Now we can't totally prevent them, but any added summons which make deaths of group members moderately less likely, will be welcomed by groups.<P>1.  Arms of Safety:  Worn item, R-click effect, 5 sec cast = Root-self with immobilize (can't attack or cast spells), minor illusion and Hidden with duration until cancelled or camped (like any illusion).<BR>This would help a character who needed to go AFK, but didn't want to log out.  <BR>I can also imagine this summon being used at the tail end of a wipe out.  Imagine being in Hate and the Majority of people have just been wiped out by a nasty train.  Your Magician quickly (sic heh) CoH's you to a somewhat distant location and you activate you're ARMS of the CONJURER.  You morph into a stone, are rooted in place, can't cast or attack, but you are somewhat safe from the remaining mobs that are running about frenzying on the remaining poor saps who didn't choose the Magician as their group member.<BR>Now this isn't a completely safe thing... something could always wander by who sees through Rogue-Hide.<BR>Additionally I don't see this as infringing on any classes skills - as you obviously couldn't do any CR or scouting with this summon, that a Rogue could do.<P>2.  Gloves of the Taunter:  Gloves that add 25% to a classes natural taunt and come with some intermediate level AC (standard chain).   I invision this being helpful when you have a Monk/Rogue who are higher level then the Warrior/tank you have, and you are struggling to keep the focus on the Warrior who is designed to take the beating better.  This will help the group function more optimally, allowing each member to better do their designed roles.  This will also reduce the amount the cleric needs to be healing the bleeder-tanks (Pal, Rogues, Monks, Rangers) when you have a full Warrior in your group.  Improved group-efficiency = more desired into group.<P>3.  Crown of Focus:  I'm trying to think of something that would make other pure casters want a Magician.  Clarity is out obviously.  But how about a damage booster.  Wear this crown, and the DD spells do 10% more damage.  The draw-back - Head slot occupied.<P>4.  Wings of Resistance:  Resistance items seem really in vogue right now - everyone wants to pick up their resists (for good reason).  This item provides a wing (worn in the little used range slot) that adds 5 to all resists.  This may seem minor when compared to some of the resist buffs out there (aka the Enchanter Group RM which adds 55 Resist Magic), but I still think that this would be welcomed by groups.<P>5.  Mind of the Twins:  Group communication is always an issue.  People have long requested that more than one group be able to be in the same group chat.  This has been turned down by VI.<BR>This item provides two twin "Brains."  The wearer of one brain can see the group chat of the other brain wear's group.  Say for example that both leaders of 2 groups wore this... then each leader could see all the chat going on in both groups... but their comments would still only be seen by their own group.  No one else in the group sees the other group's chat, and it only works if both owners of the "Brains" are wearing them (again draw back of loosing the Head slot item).  This is only good for 2 groups, but again might improve communcation and increase desirablity into a group.  Helping to know when to charge.<P>Well how's that for some suggestions off the top of my head?!?  No I can't work for VI - I'm already employed as a Physician.  (and the scary thing is that I have a Lvl 55 Magician and a Level 56 Enchanter WHILE being employed as a Physician, heh).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It makes me happy to see Alan take interest in our mage class. (So much so that I am leaving work early just so I can play my mage  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>But honestly, the best thing we can get is an ability to research our post 50 and velious spells as well as getting them as drops.  I have spent inordinate amount of time and plat on resaerch skill and components, I would like to be able to use it past 50.  Also I was shocked to find that research was in no way involved in our epic quest, but alas what is do is done.<P>More summons would be great especially ones that will make us desirable to group with.  And I am hopeful we will get something nice out of this thread.<P>Thanks Alan!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There are only a few of these idea that I agree with.  There are a few things that upset me.  Before you gave wizards IvU, everything was peachy.  Why weren't magicians given IvU?  Now every int caster BUT mages have Ivu.  Mages are also the only int caster with NO form of mana regen.  Few of my ideas:<P>Along the lines of Circlet of Shadow.  If you were only limiting this to SHD/NEC, then why did you add the effect to the Enchanter Thurgadin Armor boots?  Magicians should be able to summon an item with at least 5 charges, with INSTA-CAST invis.  <P>Aegis of Ro is another concern of mine.  I'm sure when the last patch message was sent out and said NEW spell for magicians, many were thrilled.  Why not just tell them that Aegis of Ro is now fixed?  It has been in the sp.dat file this whole time and since you fix it, it's considered new?<P>I never use Summon Shard of the core, for the simple fact that it cannot go in ammo slot, this should be a RANGE/AMMO item.  <P>Track Summoned is a great idea.  Necro can track undead mobs, why can't we search out summoned?  <P>Charm Summoned is another spell that comes to mind relating to our class.  If charming was supposed to be all about charismatics, then why were the class of the dead (Nec) given a charm undead spell?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  Hook the mages up too  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>How about Group Invis/See Invis.. would be highly useful.<P>ok, onto summons:<P>The 52 fire pet (havent experiencd 58 yet) is weak.  May have more HP then a lvl 49 fire, but it's not nearly as powerful. Please fix this.<P>Gift of Xev/Bristlebane's Bundle/etc....  If at all possible, these spells would be much easier if the food/water/etc was already in the bag when summoned.. (no idea if this is possible)<P>1HB summons would definately be handy.  I have been asked numerous times from group members wanting to work on their 1hb skill.  Mod Rods are so costly in mana that they cannot always just be given out like candy.<P>I definately like the "Summon monster to you" idea.  Wanderers in planes and high-aggro areas would be exceptionally easier with a spell like this.  High aggro would definately have to be the setback, but would be well worth it.<P>Summon Fireworks would also be a nice one to play with.. Hey, why not, we get to summon everything else =P<P>One thing someone mentioned earlier, although highly impossible, is a good idea.  Summon Coffin would be a great idea, and a complete time saver.  Just deduct ~175pp from the mages inventory.  This can be repaid by the person needing the coffin.<P>Better range on summoned arrows/throwing knives/shurikens.<P>We need an item summonable along the lines of DMF as well.  It's annoying as all hell when you need lev/see-invis/enduring breath (for example: getting to the bottom of Crystal Caverns).  How about:<P>lvl 49: Summon: Stone of the Elementalist<BR>MAGIC/LORE/NO DROP/NO RENT<BR>1 Charge Right click effect: See Invis, Enduring Breath, Levitation, +10 sv Fire/Cold<BR>maybe more charges if not too overpowered<P>-=Mentioned Before=-<BR>Something Interesting to be thrown so that us int casters will actually want to use our throwing skill.  This summoned item will have approx 150 range and a dmg or 3-5, with a small proc on it.  Preferably to be summoned in a stack of 20<P>Will post more when i think of some.<P>Thanks for the Mage Thread Alan<P>Arthionis Soulstealer<BR>Elementalist of Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Heya again Abasor,<BR>a few more thoughts<BR>Why not a summons that allows the mage to delve into the trade areas. As we know the enchanters have the death hold on the jewelery market (and perhaps rightly so) how about a summons which to summon a prime component to be used in one of the trades, tailoring perhaps, brewing, or perhaps even tinkering or alchemy to allow inter class dependency. Just a thought<P>I also like that Idea on thrown weapons with a proc, lord knows that throwing is a lost and all but forgotten art.<P>Summon monster...perhaps too powerful, but would be a huge boon for mages desirablility in a group.<P>Thanks again<BR>Czzarre</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok it irrites me to no end that I had the rather long post I put in earlier removed. <P>For Fun:<BR>Summon Black Top hat with right clickable effect summon cute fluffy bunny.  What's the point of being called a magician if you can't do this  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>For the magician:<BR>Since it seems we will not be getting some form of mana regen.  I would like to see 5 charge wands and staves that have DD's and other spells from a couple circles back.  If there cannont be mana regen then how about stored spells in the form of these items.  So the well prepared mage comes packing items to use in a fight.<P>Other misc. items that are missing are<BR>Ring of Invisiblity:  2 charges of invis, should of been there to begin with.<P>And why does the staff of warding only have 1 charge of cancel magic? While the other staves have 5 charges of the given spell.<P>For the group:<P>Good weapons in the .75 damage/delay ratio range with procs that match our elemental theme as magicians.  earth,air,wind,water.  There would have to be varrious diffrent ones other than swords imo, so you would have maybe and earthen club, a firey sword, a dagger of winds.<P>Armors: summon a full suit of armor that other classes can use that has a high ac and perhaps has 1 charge of the similar phantom armor.  The peices that arn't used by the target character can just be dumped on the groud our something along those lines.<P>Shield or ring with two charges of elemental armor.<P>Bind and Gate stones.  The cats out of the bag on this one.  Wizards can already do the gate portion for other people and there are potions for this as well.  And as my earlier post states binding items so long as it follow the same restrictions for melee characters is not unbalancing at all.<P>The value added part of having a magician in the group should be these summoned items.  They are regulated by thier no rent nature so you have to have the magician there to summon them for you. <P>Now let's discuss crowd control spells for the magician, these are a scary topic since if you could let's say root something long enough to get another pet into play you could chain cast pets all day long.<P>However I don't see anything wrong with crowd control spells that last a shorter duration than the 10 sec it takes to cast a pet.  For example 8 sec root or 7 stun or 4 sec fear/blind.  These spells in an item would mean you would have to come prepared to a fight having summoned them ahead of time.<P>And one last thing I saw an earlie post on continous low damage in an area as a spell.  This has merrit.  For example a wall of fire or blade barrier.  This has merrit and could possibly replace the horribly non functional rain spells that we get and is not subject to abuse like the earlier spells were because you are not going to be able to keep dozens of mobs immobilized while they are taking a little bit of damage.  And just to keep this on topic, put it in an item, hehe.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>How about a new dimentional pocket spell that summons a 'no drop', non-'no rent' bag for the mages exclusive use? Mages get them free anyway so what could it hurt. It would cut prep time after logging in but mostly it would protect against LD which right now is the penalty for using our summoning ability.<P>Perhaps current dimentional pockets could be given a very short life... say 5 to 10 minutes after disconnect to protect the carrier against losing items do to LD so long as they immediately log back on.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, <BR>  I feel the previous posts about the summon armor spell are not what the mage class needs. This spell will be useful for levels 20-30 maybe, and will aid newbies. It however will have NO effect on the 50+ game, where the mage lacks and needs balancing. Pre-50 mages are fine, and balanced. Will summoned armor help on a CR in in a plane? No. Will it help recover corpses in Karnor's Castle? No (just two examples). It will in very limited ways aid the mage class post 50. I feel they should get different types of summons. My ideas are:<P>) I believe mages should get a spell at level 50 that summons an item which, like a coldstone, goes into the range slot. This item will give +8 magic resist and has ONE charge of the effect "Elemental Fury" which lasts for 30 minutes after right clicking the item. This effect will be like Divine Might (it will stack with Divine Might) and add a procable damage spell paired with a short stun, or an effect along this line. This will aid in raids and will make the class a step higher towards the goal which is them being balanced post 50.<P>2) A spell called "Rage of the Element" which is a level 53 spell and castable ONLY on the mage's pet. This spell will take 500 mana to cost and have a recast time of 15 minutes. Once casted upon on the pet it will send him into a fury which somewhat resembles a dicipline. It grants the pet a HIGH amount of haste and UPS the pets strength and COMBAT SKILLS.  After this brief period of rage the pet slashes itself for 32000 damage (what pets used to do when the mage zoned), making it a spell the mage would ONLY cast in group situations. With this spell paired with the previously metioned spell, it would balance out the 50+ game.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"><P>Could you please consider adding these two spells or similar spells and also maybe increasing the drop rate of "Muzzle of Mardu"? Thanks  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> please consider my post and tell me what you think.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>i have a few suggestions..<P>1)make new mod rod that is stackable...<P>2)make snare rod that casts either 1 snare or 5 charges or something .. usable by all<P>3)summon speedo boots, slightly slower than jboots maybe even with mob speed<P>4)undead procing weapons..<P>5)animal procing weapons..<P>6)change it so at high lvl we CAN summon low weight high speed weapons to speed pets up.. maybe special summon only pet weapons.<P>Mages could become VERY group friendly by having them be able to summon loads of different pet items that could enhance pets in different ways .. like outfitting a pet to do more damage against undead.. or pets that are equipped to fight summoned mobs.. think of a scenario that lets us summon a few items that makes our pets and maybe other pets able to do battle against the undead in a dungeon dominated by undead. And i mean not just weapons that proc.. how about a modifying mask that increases a pets speed against undead, or adds an extra +2 or +3 to weapon damage against undead or summoned mobs, or animals . etc .<P>last but not least, i would LOVE to see something, ANYTHING that improves our pets regen or healing ability !!! new spell, regen item, heal rod, focus item that regens them while we hold it ... ANYTHING hehe<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Point of order?<P>&gt;&gt; The same goes for any item that you might hand to someone to give them something that they were not intended to get, i.e. Bind Affinity &lt;&lt;<P>What about these? <BR>Heatstone (infravision)<BR>Coldstone (ultravision)<BR>Waterstone (Enduring Breath)<BR>Ring of Levitation (Levitation)<BR>Staff of Tracing (Flare)<BR>Staff of Warding (Glimpse)<BR>Staff of Runes (cancel magic)<BR>Staff of Symbols (see invis)<P>Seems to me to be a trademark of the Mage spell line that we can store utility spells into summoned items for anyone to use. This ability has not been carried into the 50+ game whatsoever. What better way to address magician resentment at watered-down 51+ spells without changing the 50+ game radically?<P>Given that melee travel has been raised as an element of unnecessary downtime at higher levels, please don't discount bind (staying cities-only) / gate (1.5x the cast time of regular gate, interruptable, almost impossible to use while being bashed) / invis items out of hand. <P>This would give the Magician a completely unique skill in the game (essentially a delayed-cast bind affinity / gate), without introducing new spells to be tuned into the game, and indirectly throw the meleers a bone on the travel front.<P>Given that many old issues are being looked at again (including class exp penalties, exp levels in dungeons, downtime) I think this one deserves another look-in. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Give mages the ability to summon a weapon with negative AC, negative stat modifiers, etc, and no proc. These would be droppable, but NO RENT, and tradable to mobs. Perfect for giving to those mobs who carry weaps which proc against us, and all mobs in general. A weapon-based debuff. Would probly have to be a very high hate lvl against the mage.<P>Also.....regarding the "summon mob" issue....most people suggested a high hate component for this spell. I would say maybe instead of a hate component, how about a long recast time of a few minutes? I know some mages that would trade death for themselves over death for the group, but I also know some that wouldn't. Spells are useless if the caster is afraid to cast it.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;Lose track of your pet? Cast Summon Pet to bring it by your side.<P>or... /pet summon command&lt;&lt;<P>Yeah but give it a better name like "Call of the Elements", and give necros "Call of the Dead", if that's not already a name of one of their spells (don't play a necro can ya tell?) or even "Summon animated corpse".  Give these spells somewhere between 29 and 39, to make pets less undesirable in dungeons and later on raids.  Maybe give one at 29 with no memblur, and one later that has a memblur effect like call of the hero.<P>Better weapons with different situational procs.  One that procs a small fire DD, one that procs a small ice DD, one that procs a small magic DD, one that procs Bezerker strength like the PGT (Obviously a high-level summon so as not to nullify the use of the actual PGT) for when you need your pet to be able to take more punishment.  A Rune I or II-type spell would be fine for this too.<P>These would all obviously be one-handed weapons, so our pets can Dual wield them.  <P>Upgraded mod rods at 55 or so. (either higher ratio/total conversion than our current ones or just one with 2 or 3 charges)<P>A line of sight summon mob spell for pulling, that wouldn't aggro nearby mobs.  It would have a slightly higher chance of failure than harmony pulling due to ease of use.  Outdoor-only spell.<P>That's all for now.<P>--Sanguine</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I know this isnt exactly the subjet. but other than summoning somthing at higher lvls that proc i think we have bigger issuses than summoning items.  soloing for us at higher lvls is wayyy hard.  wizards and druids can quad kite, and necros are necros.  Most people dont want us in groups either.  I would like to see some perhaps improvements in our velious dot spells.  They just dont seem to be worth the cast delay, and how much they are resisted.  I do think that giving us a dot is a good idea but i think it should do a little more.  I think we should either be made more group friendly or more solo capable.  Perhaps fixing our fire pets.  or being able to summon our pets more things to increase thier power/regen.  Another idea is letting us have a better pet heal.  On the group side if we go that way i would like to see perhaps some summonablte haste items.  that stack.  like our mask to pets.  perhaps just not as much haste as it gives our pets.  it will take up a precious inventory slot, thus not infringing on shaman and chanters. Somthing i have never understood is that we are masters of the elements correct? So why dont we get more varied dds?  I dont want to infringe on wizzy nuke power, but on the topic of summoning perhaps some items that either have right click charges of different elements. If that is not an option i like the idea mentioned earlier about about weapons that proc different elements.  Summoned sword that procs root, air weapon that is fast and procs stun,  water that procs a dd, and fire that either gives a small shield(kinda like okiels flickering flame that will stack with our shield) or a small dd.  To me other options such as bind affinity staffs sound nice, but will not help us get groups.  It will help us get annoying tells.  To summerize please give us somthing that makes us more group friendly, or a bit more solo capable.  I simply say this because it seems that druids are more group wanted but can still solo more.  Necros can solo way more.  <P>Thank you for your time, and forgive the punctuation. im not much of a typist. <P>Baharoth<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Y'know, whenever I get on my mage and summon an earth pet, he cries to me..."Master may I please have some clothes it is cold out here and this rain is hell on my complexion." You know how fashion plays a role in this game. I wear a Ceremonial Wedding Sword(no atk/dly) just because it looks sweet. Icy Greaves because I can say that I'm a bard 8^). Gnome Skin looks great with the jet black color. I wear this stuff whenever I'm not killing something because it is more appealing to the eye. My idea is to have summonable PET ONLY armor that has a graphic. Think of it, armor with 1-10 ac each depending on what piece it is and only the visible ones. Of course this stuff would not work for mage pets since they don't have legs or feet....but a tunic/bp would show up, vambraces, bracers, gauntlets, hey maybe even have a lil helm for the poor guys(have it dangling above the body somewhere heheh). We'd be able to give it to necro pets, it would just change the texture of their bones so you can still tell the difference between them and a player(not including the spectre pets they already look kickass). At 50+ maybe have the items give a minor effect like the damage shield proposed before, only a minor one, but constantly on. Minor regen effect?

</FONT><HR>For people here that complain about being accepted in groups, I understand and you are right.  It would be nice to have something (besides CoH) that would make groups want us.  HOWEVER, we are supposed to be a class that can solo.  That's why I chose a Mage in the first place.  Eventually, for me, soloing became mind-numbingly boring and I began to group.  My choice...and now I have to bear the burdens of choosing a soloing class and now grouping (ei, less desirability).  What I would really like to have, and it's been mentioned here before, is another avenue of escape when I AM soloing.  A Rod of Invulnerablity (Lore, No Drop, one charge of invulnerability), a Rod of Feign Death (same thing), or something along those lines...even a Root.  Give it a really long recast time so that it is used as a last chance and not an all time spell.  Necros and Druids, the other recognized solo classes, have many different options for escaping a bad situation (root, feign, snare, sow, fear, invulnerability, etc.)  I'd just like to have another option besides Gate to bail myself out from time to time.<BR>   Beyond that, some USEFUL weapons would be nice  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050113-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050113.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050113-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050113-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050113-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050113-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=050113&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=050113&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
