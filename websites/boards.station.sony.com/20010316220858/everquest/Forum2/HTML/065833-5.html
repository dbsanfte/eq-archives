There is a **** load of work involved to being able to make it to certain zones. which is why the BEST armors and weapons are the reward. if you dont invest alot of time in this game, dont complain when u cant afford what you want. its your choice!!<P>T.

</FONT><HR>Funny, I got all the way to 60 with only Kunark zones just fine, and I sure as hell never had to play 16 friggin hours to get there.  You know what it takes to play eq regularly?  You need to be one of those lucky freaks of nature who don't need seven or eight hours of sleep to function normally.  You'd be amazed what an advantage having a few extra hours a day over your household really is.  <P>When nag and vox were first being killed regularly by power guilds, the masses complained about the dragons being out of reach and "uber only"  Six months later, there was often multiple groups of guilds adding up to hundreds of people logging on within seconds of the servers coming up after a patch to race to the kill.  People started complaining about there not being ENOUGH uber encounters to keep everyone busy.  Server splits were started, and eventually Kunark came.  However with the extra levels those dragons became so easy even single groups could take them out.  Why would they want to?  Because the loot is STILL amongst the best in the game.  The level cap was a bandaid solution that nobody liked, and was a direct result of reward being too good for the effort.  (there's no such thing as risk vs reward.  It's EFFORT vs reward)<P>If you give powerful items to something a so called "casual" gamer can do with reasonable numbers, the power gamers aren't just going to back off and say "well that item is awesome but that's just too darn easy to get!"  Heck no.  If you put one uber item on a powerful mob, and that same item in a quest split up on four easy mobs, the power gamer is going to kill BOTH for twice as many items.  Duh.  They put so called "epic" quests into the game that mostly required 1-2 groups, with a few exceptions.  Result?  Power guilds equipped every member and their twink with an "epic" weapon in a matter of weeks, denying the spawns from the so called "casual" players that the quests were designed to please.  Why?  Because the items are BETTER than those dropping from mobs tuned to their level of play.  The quality of the rewards on uber encounters is what keeps power gamers busy on the top 3% of the game and not RUINING the other 97% for everyone else.  <P>You guys completely ignored this question in the first post:  Do you really want to compete with US over the same content?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Deathshadow said::--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>This thread is really quite humorous. It seems that most of the upset people here are forgetting that this is a game and not ther real life.. (if this assumption is not true... if EQ is your only life than you are hopeless and should be ignored as a sorry excuse for a human life)<BR>______________________________________________<P><BR>EQ is more of a "hobby" to most people that "just a game".  People become passionate about their hobbies.  It is a natural human inclination to invest emotional value and attachment to anything one spends a considerable amount of time with.<P>_________________________________________<BR> How many people have played Diablo 2, or Starcraft? Did you manage to beat Diablo in the Hell difficulty? Do you have a level 50 hardcore character? This area of the game is inacessible to most people who played that game, including me, yet i bought and played that game and don't feel *cheated* that some parts of the game requored more time than i had avalibe.<BR>_______________________________________________<P>Diablo is designed to be completely playable by it's TARGET clientelle .. people that generally are looking for a fun solo adventure against the game.  Just because something is ACCESSIBLE to the target encounter/clientelle doesn't mean that it's EASY to get, or that everyone will have one .. it only means that it is possible to attain the item or experience the content via the parameters of the target customer base's playing habits.<P>__________________________________________________<BR> Heh, I bet you feel upset that you are not entitled to go to an Ivy League school like Harvard or MIT also. You are the type of person that expects to get everything that you want, and I'm sorry to inform you that that is not the way the world works.<BR>____________________________________________<P>This isn't about the world, and real life limitations and requirements.  This is about how Verant CHOOSES to separate content.<P><BR>______________________________________________<P> There are places in this game that are meant only for a certain segment of the player base to encounter and enjoy.<P>________________________________________________<P><BR>Yes, like solo adventures and PvP servers, alternate playstyle content is provided to try to appeal to the "fringes" of the customer base.  ONE of those "fringes" are those capable of regular "uber-raids".  They represent less than 10% of the customer base.  While it is logical to provide content for them, as for the other "fringe" segments of the population, it demonstrates PANDERING when that content delivers EXCLUSIVE rewards.  Does SOLOING deliver exclusive rewards?  Does PvP deliver exclusive rewards?  No?  <P>___________________________<P><BR> Deal with it, oh, and if you feel that you would have *wasted* your time by leaving this game for one that gives you whatever you want ( you probably played Diablo 1 with a Trainer) then I truly pity you because you, like many, have missed the point of Everquest.<P>________________________________<P><BR>I didn't realize there WAS an authorized "point" to Everquest, other than enjoying it.<P><BR>_________________________________________<BR> It is not about aquiring "stuff", that is the *means* to the end. The end is having *fun* with other people. If you feel that all of the levels leading up to where you are now were *work* just to get to the good stuff you will *never* be happy. That is just the way it is. It isn't a problem with game mechanics or balance for people like you, it is a problem with your outlook on life and this game<BR>___________________________________________<P>/boggle<P>I'm sorry .. what does any of this have to do with asking for high level content that doesn't require UBER-raid playstyle/lifestyle?  <P>Most of us enjoy the game very much, and have a great time with our friends.  I"m thrilled with my RyGorr armor ; ) and my Burnt Ember.  I don't need to go to the planes or Veeshan's Peak.  This isn't about me not enjoying the game or being dissatisfied with the game.<P>I enjoy the game very much.  However, that doesn't change the observable fact that it has some design flaws that stem from it's focus on the "uber-encounter" as the end-game standard fare.  I'd like to see that changed. I consider this an appropriate venue for presenting my opinion and argument in order to, perhaps, make some headway towards changing the design focus of the game.<P>Because I consider it a SERIOUS business error on the part of Verant to focus on "elevating" 5-10% of their customer base at the arbitrary expense of the other 90%, and I think it COULD shorten the long-term viability of this game ... I plan on playing EQ for a very long time, and I think this needs to be addressed.  <P>I think Verant needs to re-conceptualize who they are designing the game FOR, because from the last couple of installments, I think they are mistaken as to who they need to be trying to please.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Meleagar: So you think that a person with 200 total hours played should get the same content someone with 20 hours played should, just more of the same? Somehow I seriously doubt that is what you mean. What I take you to mean is that the size of the "chunks" you play in shouldn't matter. I agree that that can be a frustrating problem, and I'd like to see it addressed in the game... although I'm not sure quite how to go about it without cheapening something else. But seriously, shouldn't those who have played to level 60 have access to content people can't get at level 1? How is raiding any different than that, other than that it requires bigger chunks of time? Why shouldn't there be exclusive content, say, for those people with 5000 hours invested?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;"After Kunark was released there were over 100 zones available (I think it was 101). So you are talking about 1% of the zones in the game."<BR> <BR>Sure, if you count Felwithe as 3 zones, and Neriak, and Freeport, and Queynos, and other racial hometowns like those.  While some evil types do hunt guards in Freeport (exploiting the zone lines in my opinion), cities aren't really "available" in the sense that you can take a group there for experience or loot.<BR> <BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;"But we did not change complete heal at all."<BR> <BR>But the last two patch messages made some mention about agro changes being made to healing spells, specifically Complete Heal.  While the basic mechanics of the spell weren't changed, the game's response to a player casting that spell has been dramatically altered.  Please don't say such ingenuous things, this isn't a hair-splitting contest.<BR> <BR>I tend to agree with the original poster's general thesis.  The development efforts from Kunark onward have been focused intensively on the post-50 game to the detriment of the core game, pre-expansion.  When a character reaches 60, instead of following the classic RPG procedure of retirement or semi-retirement, and starting a new character over, the majority of end-game players continue to play their level 60 characters and expect to find risks and rewards worthy of a level 60 player.  <P>Instead of encouraging people to try another race/class combo, Verant has introduced mobs and zones that will challenge level 60 characters.  Seemingly a lot of the real effort in Velious went into providing content for these die-hards.<BR> <BR>Maybe if the pre-50 game got some changes, some new zones (especially some new NEWBIE zones, the Warrens are a GREAT idea BTW), the die-hard level-60 crowd would be encouraged to start a new race-class combo and have fun with it.  But I can understand how they just don't want to go through it again, with the spellbook graphic for 35 levels, the wandering agro mobs (for level 51+ quests mostly) up to 45 levels higher than the newbie zones they wander, the complete inability to land a spell on a deep red, the absolutely PUNK weapons and armor available for the first 30 levels (other than a few highly farmed named NPCs like the Mucktail Gnoll with the PGT and CDS).<BR> <BR>Maybe if the early levels were made less like a fraternity hazing (the spellbook graphic when medding for 35 levels is a great example of being punished just for being a newbie, plain and simple), people wouldn't CLING so to their oh-so-retirable mains, and start playing their twinks more often.  Then the Live Team wouldn't be forced to spend the hellish amount of time they currently do trying to balance the high end game.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Pen and Paper? Single-player games? The nearest equivalent to MMOGs are the old MUDs, and it was hardly a classic procedure for people to retire their characters when they hit whatever the max was. Usually, they kept playing, since you couldn't have second or third or eighth characters usually. A great deal of the design challenge was trying to figure out what to do with these people to keep the game challenging. I think Everquest has done a reasonably good job of giving people something good to do at level 60, at least for classes that can go on raids, and especially melee classes that can go on raids and actually have more use for items that drop there. But still, lots better than many MUDs used to.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I agree that that can be a frustrating problem, and I'd like to see it addressed in the game... although I'm not sure quite how to go about it without cheapening something else.<BR>______________________________________________<P>I gave the example of how the game should be designed around a group of 6 with 2-3 hours to play.  Perhaps it takes 14 days  of 2.5  hr investments to acquire item X from Mob X.  This represents 210 man-hours.<P>The UBER-version event, then, is 36 people taking one chunk of 6 hrs to RAID mob Uber-X, which drops item X every time.  This represents 216 man-hours .. approximately the same investment.<P>____________________________________________<BR> But seriously, shouldn't those who have played to level 60 have access to content people can't get at level 1?<BR>_____________________________________________<P><BR>Of course.  "Uber" isn't a LEVEL, it's a playstyle.  People that can play 8-10 hrs a day 5-6 days a week should NOT have access to any EXCLUSIONARY content simply because they can invest larger, more frequent chunks of time .. they should only get the content FASTER, and in greater  QUANTITIES, via alternate UBER-MOBS if they so choose.<P>_________________________________________<BR> How is raiding any different than that, other than that it requires bigger chunks of time? Why shouldn't there be exclusive content, say, for those people with 5000 hours invested?<BR>________________________________________________<P><BR>There should be.  But I don't see the point in rewarding that 5000 hour benchmark ONLY if it was attained via 8+ hr chunk investments.<P>EQ doesn't reward TIME .. it rewards a specific PLAYSTYLE.  It rewards specific RL parameters/personalities/gaming habits.  This style has been around since the old MUD days, where cliques of professional gamers competed against designers, and the designers were consumed with providing adequate content for the professional gaming cliques.<P>That was fine back in the days when a 14.4 baud modem gave you an edge in those PvP duels in text MUDs ...because virtually everyone that played those games WERE "professional gamers" ... if not, man they got run out of these domains pretty fast.  Nobody got killed faster or run out on a rail quicker in those days than the amateurs.  They got their arse handed to 'em on a stick.<P>But that's not the way the MMORPG market is today ... and Verant still doesn't get it.  This isn't a competition between the elite professionals and game designers ... but they still code as if it WERE.  This is a MASS MARKET game now where the AMATEURS are you main concern, because they represent 90%+ of your client base.<P>Those amateurs largely have no desire to "RAID", or learn every twist and turn and aspect of the game to demonstrate a dazzling knowledge of EQ.  They want to log on for 2-3 hrs a day with their buds and laugh, play, maybe quest a bit or kill something and maybe, every now and then, get a cool item that makes their character look neat or makes him or her slightly more powerful.<P>When these non-ubers see someone carrying an Epic and say to themselves .. .wow, how do I get THAT!!! How COOL!!  Let me get my friends together and well see how we go about getting that ...<P>Only to find out it is utterly out of reach.  They would have to change their lifestyle, sacrifice personal and relationship needs & demands, and make a commitment to the game they just aren't willing to make in order to even have a CHANCE of getting really neato item.  And this describes 90% of the EQ customer base.<P>Not a smart thing to do if you're EQ, to show your client base really neat stuff and then say, "nyah, nyah, you can't get it you can't get it ..."<P>/shrug</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think the Ubers are missing part of the point here.  <P>1- Some feel that an inordinate amount of time is spent trying to make the game fun for the Uber players.<P>2- A game balanced and designed for the an elite class of players is out of balance and ill designed for the unanointed.<P>3- Rebalancing things like the planes so that they are still challanging for the elites- mmorg inflation - is unfair to those who are unable to reach those places first.<P>The issues that those of us derisively referred to as 'casual' or 'time starved' have is that while we pay the same (and by mass more) than all the FOH members, multiple accounts or not, but the game seems to be designed, maintained, geared and changed for them.  <P>Issues are defended by VI reps as what is good for FOH is good for us.  <P>FOH elites berate anyone on this board who indicates that they are unwilling to play for 8 hours straight, whenever the servers pop, as whiners and weaklings and incompetent players.  <P>When it is suggested that, my golly, even public groups are able to break into the planes a year later, it is some indication that the planes are too easy now.  But this ignores that the planes are only easy for those who have been there for the past year.  For those just getting there, who are still wearing cloth armor bits, who have not actually seen the pathing, guaged the hitpoint bar and counted the spawn rate, the place is still new and difficult.  There are more people there, true, but this merely detracts from the glory of being first - this was true in BB, true in LOI.  Now not only will we not get to go first - we will not get to go at all.<P>Catch-22 can't go to the planes until you know how to fight in the planes and own plane rate gear.  <P>Too bad, so sad, shoulda levelled faster.<P>Can Everquest keep the casual player if the game is only for FOH?  Why should we stay, once we are behind the mudflation curve, the game gets harder for the firsters it just becomes impossible for the leftbehinds?  Can FOH subscriptions alone pay for the next upgrade?  <P>--I still think that there should be servers balanced for those who feel the need to consume content at an astounding rate and who have only the best gear - make the firebeetles hit for duel 200's for all it matters - VI can balance and nerf to their hearts content.  Make encounter that take 48 hours realtime.  Make it so challangeing that even MIIR is amazed at the difficulty.  But these types of encounters, the time spent creating them, do nothing for the rest of us and in some cases eventually directly does us harm.  Did anyone have to give back the stuff they won, the things they did, while they had the advantages of free healing BP's?  Those in the back of the line only get to face tougher (retuned) encounters and nerfed abilities.  The FOH servers can be as tough as you want em to be.  The encounters can require legions of Warriors, companies of clerics, 200 people 20 hours to complete - but these encounters are more than useless for a vast majority of players.  The mundane servers could be geared to the 6 man team - the under 4 hour timeframe.  Will the mundane servers be as hard as FOH's - not to the people on FOH - but for the single group who knows it does not need to be on the FOH servers, it can be challenging, can require many deaths, can require only warrior-cleric groups if you want, but they would at least be more closely designed for the people actually playing and not just the few players out pushing the envelope of the game.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>What is your solution? Listen, I'm not so far from the casual gamer in their mentality. The fact is, this game is broken and has a faulty foundation. <P>Do you think I ENJOY 40-50 man raids? I would rather repeatedly bang my head INTO A WALL. I know I'm not alone in feeling this way.<P>The game was orginally designed for a MAX of 24 people per raid. This can even be seen as a design mission up to the Plane of Sky (24 keys max attainable per island). The problem is, what you or I may do with 24, someone else will do with 6. Pretty soon after, everyone will be doing it with 6. Do you see the problem here? <P>The most enjoyable time for me in this game is an 18 person raid that GETS something done. This is why Sleeper's Tomb was so fun before they nerfed it to hell. You see what happens though? Sleeper's is a perfect example of how we ALL get shafted, uber or casual. The boss mobs in Sleeper's went from being doable by 18 (by boss I mean Warders, please don't come in here and chest thump about killing MoG with 18, we did it with 5) to being impossible with even a force of 100.<P>They need to keep the carrot dangling. You don't dangle the carrot at the donkey's midsection do you? Hope that helps... <P>I'm all for 12-18 man groups being able to actually get uber encounters done, I just don't EVER EVER EVER see it happening. <P>I understand your concerns but I'm also a realist - your concerns won't be addressed because they simply can't be addressed. Re-read Kreugen's posts, they summarize the reasoning very well.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Yes, I specifically meant pencil-and-paper RPG's.  All the pencil-and-paper RPG campaigns I have ever played have eventually reached a point where some of the original characters were so grossly overpowered that there were no challenges worthy of them.  <P>Sometimes the GM would have a sort of meta-game for retired characters, where we would have feifdoms and build roads and temples (used the Civilization3 model once as I recall), and some of my characters I turned over to the DM to be used as NPC's.<BR> <BR>I still run into some of my retired characters now, when I travel through their lands.  I avoid the castle of Lane the Wizard though, she was far too fond of combat, and I fear she would view a band of adventurers as a fun contest.  <P>I prefer the castle of Lord Talar, my retired lawful fighter.  He is particularly hospitable, as he is trying to make up for his irrational behavior regarding Orcs, especially the Lawful Orcs.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You make good points, Meleager, but I differ on my interpretation of some of the actual effects of them. First off, I'm not sure how much of the exlclusivity of "uber-content" is due to big chunks of time and how much is due to just having spent tons of time in the game generally. If I (a decidedly non-uber gamer) spent 2-3 years playing Everquest, never more than 4 hours at a time, could I reach most of the content? If you knew 30 people well in-game (of the right classes) and had agreed on a time, could you pull off a raid in 4 hours? And, of course, who you know in the game isn't related at all to the size of the chunks of time you play and is much more related to how much time in general you play and in how much energy you invest in it.<P>As for the attitudes of the "average" person playing the game... I'm in two minds. Your assessment may be, in fact, relatively correct. But it's also alien to most other types of games. There are very few non-computer games in which I would expect to reach the highest level of skill without fundamental, life-altering changes. I could possibly be a decent golf player if I played a round once a week. But I won't be as good as a professional, unless I decide to drop my life and pursue golf. This seems fairly close to Everquest. The difference, however, is in expectation. I don't EXPECT to become a super golfer without sacrificing other parts of my life. I don't EXPECT to get the rewards a professional gets or expect professional golfers to play on my local metro course and nothing more difficult. Why do "average" Everquest players expect to be able to compete with the (insane IMO) people that spend 8 hours per day playing? I don't know, but I'd hazard a guess that they are conditioned that way from single player computer games. In those types of games, you could pretty much expect to achieve everything everyone else did, because it is completely noncompetetive and is geared so that everyone can experience the entire game. The multi-player model is totally different in its expectations and assumptions, and I think people haven't really adapted to it yet.<P>As for group size... I just plain disagree with you here. In fact, I think the problem with the big raid-style groups at the end of the game is that they weren't something you were practicing all game. IMO, requiring larger groups of people at least requires that you work reasonably well with other people and aren't someone totally anti-social. I'd like to see a lot more things for much, much lower levels to do in 30 person groups. I think that if people got used to multi-group playing from the beginning of the game, that many fewer people would have trouble getting into raids at the upper end. I have absolutely no trouble with a requirement for 30 or 40 or 50 or whatever the hardware can handle for killing the biggest and baddest monsters at any given level.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>By the way, maybe those old MUDs are the nearest equivalent of EQ in the MMORPG sense, but I ask you, where are those old MUDs these days?  While a few of them carry on, their heyday is over.<BR> <BR>D&D, on the other hand, is more popular today than ever.  What gave it that staying power, and how did the MUDs lack it?  Well, the MUDs were essentially programs running on computers.  As has been pointed out, they often wouldn't allow multiple characters, for example.<BR> <BR>Well, the basic strength of D&D has been its flexibility.  In the campaign I am currently playing, all the players have two characters each, and run them simultaneously.  That way, if you get knocked out or killed, you're still playing on another character.<BR> <BR>EQ has blown the MUDs away, partly because of the graphic beauty, partly because of the familiar MUD-style text interface, and partly because EQ is more flexible than most MUDs used to be.  There are no time limits, up to 8 characters per server are allowed, and so forth.<BR> <BR>Has anyone here who has played D&D up to around level 20 ever kept playing that character and expected the DM to come up with new challenges every week?  I have to say, I haven't seen ANYONE who brought their level 20 characters out except for a special occasion, like maybe raiding Yogg-Sossoth or Cthulu....<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>They CAN'T stop nerfing things based on a few people's actions?  Or they won't?  Verant has placed things in the game and changed the game's difficulty based on activities of a very small number of players.  This isn't good for the majority of the players, nor Everquest overall.<P>Let's consider the Planes.  These are accessible at level 46, and you can make it to most of them without even owning Kunark.  Verant has seen that these encounters do not represent the level of challenge and difficulty they intended the planes to FOR A SMALL NUMBER OF PLAYERS.  In response, they are raising the difficulty level to be something you would be hard pressed to hope to survive at level 50.  This shuts out anyone who does not own Kunark, and is not a response to the general player of Everquest.<P>The proper response would be to add another level to the planes that you achieve by defeating the 'god' there, opening a gateway.  This would lead to the actual difficult location, leaving the normal planes unchanged.  THERE Verant can add their super items and insanely difficult army of uber encounters.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I saw this thread on Casters Realm, and I couldn't resist posting.  Velious is all for UBER guilds as far as I'm concerned.  Except maybe the first 2 zones.  I don't care what Verant says about it being within reach of most players.  IT IS NOT.  Here is the deal, I'm ok with the dang thing being for GUILDS... (which is prolly more accurate then the UBER GUILD claim).  But, I didn't know that when I bought it.  So, I am quite disappointed.  Maybe I'm in the minority, but Velious is definately out of my reach even with my level 50 character.  I only play a couple hours at a time, maybe 3 if I am really going crazy.  It isn't worth the travel time to get there and ya better go with your guild cause ya aint gonna "pickup" a group.  The interface upgrades are sweet, but I feel that is all I got when I bought Velious.  I wouldn't buy it unless you are in a guild and you like to go on guild raids.  Because there is almost nothing in velious for a single group.  Even if you don't have to be in an UBER guild... most of the content is guild oriented and requires multiple groups to handle.  I'm sticking to Kunark, the second best continent in the game (antonica rules, but now that I finally hit 50 after almost 2 years of playing I need someplace else to go hehe).  I just wish you didn't have to buy Velious to get the client enhancements.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, while I agree with your main assertion, there are a few points that I think Verant needs to take into account.<P>1) High level players leave, and lower level players level up.  Both of these happen, not just lower level becomes higher level.  <P>2) It is not that you need a large amount of people to take down a monster, but that you need specific classes.  By 4% of the players, the poster probably meant the uber guilds and indeed those are probably the only guilds who can draw 6-10 clerics, warriors, and 3-4 enchanters out of their sleeves on a raid.  Yes, smaller guilds can ally up to take on bigger mobs, but usually the reason why these guilds are smaller is because they don't have that many active "required" classes.

</FONT><HR>Kreugen said:<P>______________________________________________<BR>If you give powerful items to something a so called "casual" gamer can do with reasonable numbers, the power gamers aren't just going to back off and say "well that item is awesome but that's just too darn easy to get!" Heck no. If you put one uber item on a powerful mob, and that same item in a quest split up on four easy mobs, the power gamer is going to kill BOTH for twice as many items. Duh. They put so called "epic" quests into the game that mostly required 1-2 groups, with a few exceptions. Result? Power guilds equipped every member and their twink with an "epic" weapon in a matter of weeks, denying the spawns from the so called "casual" players that the quests were designed to please. Why? Because the items are BETTER than those dropping from mobs tuned to their level of play. The quality of the rewards on uber encounters is what keeps power gamers busy on the top 3% of the game and not RUINING the other 97% for everyone else. <BR>______________________________________________<P>I will address this in particular because it points out how the "professional player" has a natural tendency to rationalize the current MMORPG status quo, simply because it is self-serving.<P>I can think up all kinds of ways to circumvent this.  First you could randomize loots so that "Creature A" drops item "Z" 10% of the time, and "Creatures of same level of A" or "Creatures in same zone as A" drop item "Z" 1% of the time.<P>Make it so that, on balance, the same number of "Z"s are entering the world at the same rate.<P>Also... how many Ubers are going to spend a week or two HOPING the item will drop, when they can RAID and be SURE it will drop?  <P>Now, we're not talking about loot that has an equal in the casual-players grasp, we're talkinga bout special loot EXCLUSIVE to uber-raid ability.  If that gets distributed around via a modicum of random drops on 1-groupable MoBs, then at least the target encounter has a CHANCE of scaring up the item in question.<P><BR>Now, as for "Epic Quests" ... come on, SURELY you realize there are 100 ways to do epic quests that have NOTHING at all to do with involving an Uber-raid.  It could involve rare drops off of MOSS SNAKES and FIRE BEETLES that drop so infrequently as to limit the creation of epic weapons to 1 a month.  You could find 1000 under-hunted creatures no higher than level 35 throughout the world, set up special drop tables, and have ubers combing Rathe Mts for Lizard Warriors for months looking for rare drops .. or hunting FISH in Lake Rathe for weeks.<P>Uber quests could also involve REAL TIME patience, as sequence of the quest could require that one just WAIT for several days while a portion of the quest is completed by an NPC.  <P>You could have someon have to collect 8 very rare drops off of normal creatures, and turn it in for one combo item .. then have to do it all over again.<P>All one has to control is the rarity of the drops to control how fast they enter the world.<P>This gives EVERYONE, regardless of playstyle, at least the HOPE that they can achieve that top notch quest and top notch drops. <P>There is also the entire "mini-zone" or versions thereof.  For instance . .you could do a variation of the "duel" code and isolate the group and mob battle from outside  influence ... mini-zone isolated dungeon experiences for single groups .. there are ways to code it, and ways to do it, if one first gets OUT of the professional-gaming mentality and WANTS to code for the enjoyment of the majority of the customers.<P>But, you first have to get out of the mentality that skews everything into the "uber" end-game mentality.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It did give advantage to "macro players" who would automate tasks to gain skill and leave their machines logged in 24/7 but even that isn't really true any more.  And it wasn't necessary for you to do that if you wanted to see the bottom of Hythloth or the Second Age dungeons.<P>The point is thus refuted by counter-example.<P>k thx drive through.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>TJH said:<P>_______________<BR>And, of course, who you know in the game isn't related at all to the size of the chunks of time you play and is much more related to how much time in general you play and in how much energy you invest in it.<BR>________________________<P>My reply,<P>As per "chunks of time" vs "overall time" ... <BR>The greater the chunk of time you can invest, the more you can get done.  If you only have an hour to play, just finding a group can take up most of that.  Let's say it takes 30 minutes to find a group.  If you play 2 hrs, that's 20% of your time.  If you play 10 hrs, that's 5% of your playtime.  Over the course of a year, even if BOTH PLAYERS have logged exactly equal amounts of playtime, the one that can put in more per chunk can accomplish a LOT MORE in most areas of the game.<P>As far as "knowing" other people, this has nothing to do with the time it takes for many uber-raids.  They take 6-18+ hrs (depending on the objective).  Sometimes that means you can't leave before the group is ready to leave or else you leave them vulnerable.<P>Don't mistake me for someone who doesn't know a lot of people in-game .. I do.  I'm involved with a multi-guild alliance of players with casual playstyles, probably in all over 100 players.  There's no real reason to go through the massive effort to coordinate a raid simply because the "potential" payoff for any single member is remote, and the fact is .. none of us enjoys raids like that.<P>TJH said:_________________________________________<BR>Why do "average" Everquest players expect to be able to compete with the (insane IMO) people that spend 8 hours per day playing? I don't know, but I'd hazard a guess that they are conditioned that way from single player computer games. In those types of games, you could pretty much expect to achieve everything everyone else did, because it is completely noncompetetive and is geared so that everyone can experience the entire game. The multi-player model is totally different in its expectations and assumptions, and I think people haven't really adapted to it yet.<BR>_____________________________________________<P>My reply:<BR>I appreciate the intellgence and calm nature of your post  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>You can compare EQ to RL or to other single-player games at get contradictory models. SHOULD EQ's "best" content be reserved for the "uber" playstyle?  It depends on two things; (1) what the design team is trying to accomplish, and (2) who your target demographic is.<P>Is the GOAL to create a MMORPG that "ultimately" rewards "uber" playstyles?  Or is the goal to "ultimately" reward creativity, intelligence, loyalty, or any other player characteristic?  Look at it from this example:<P>The goal of Verant is, at some level, to maintain as loyal a client base for as long as possible, and to expand that client base as much as possible (this equals maximum profit).  By the nature of the game, some content is going to be regarded as "the best", regardless of how anyone tries to avoid using that term.<P>By making the "best" content exclusive to those that can spend  massive amounts of continuous, frequent time in the game, they are not accomplishing this goal.  Why?  Because the very nature of the players that CAN accomplish this task will do so in very short order.  The number of players that CAN accomplish this represent a small fraction of the current, and POTENTIAL player base.<P>Lets look at an alternative "best" scenario.  Let's  say that there is an epic quest for every slot for every class.  Let us further state that  a character can only be on ONE epic quest for its class at a time.  Further, let's say these quests cannot begin until level 50.<P>Let us further state that each quest is broken down into non-epic parts that involve no-drop items, and that  each step involves  a REAL TIME waiting period (dated slips given by NPCs).  Let us further state that each slot is given an absolute REAL TIME required for the quest that is the sum of all the real-time delays of each part of the quest.<P>If you do all of, say, the Epic Arm Gear Druid quest as fast as  possible, the quickest you CAN get the final product is 2 months.  The breastplate takes 6 months, the leggings 4, the collar 1 month, etc.  Filling every slot for a single class takes 2 years of REAL TIME.  Furthermore, lets state that  each ACCOUNT is limited to 2 simultaneous EPIC quests.  8 chars, but you can only be doing 2 epic quests.<P>THIS kind of "uber-loot" system "ultimately" rewards those that stay with the game for long periods of time. It rewards product LOYALTY.  It is also very achiveable by your TARGET DEMOGRAPHIC.  It also draws in the largest number of NEW CUSTOMERS when they realize that they, too, can get UBER loot without  having to SACRIFICE or CHANGE their lifestyle  .. they just have to be patient and loyal.<P>TJH said:______________________________________<BR>I have absolutely no trouble with a requirement for 30 or 40 or 50 or whatever the hardware can handle for killing the biggest and baddest monsters at any given level.<BR>______________________________________________<P>My reply:<BR>And yes, those kind of raids should be present in the game, for those people that ENJOY doing such things .. but they shouldn't provide EXCLUSIVE content, only  greater chances of getting, or greater quantities of, content designed to be achievable by the core demographic of the game.<P>It's not a matter of not knowing how to organize  a raid for most of us .. it's a matter that it is just not enjoyable.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I find it quite ironic that the people disputing eduin's post are one, the mouthpiece of the designers, Absor, providing elegant proof just how deeply out of touch they are with the reality of the player base, and two, mouthpieces from FoH, the guild most representative of where the tunnel vision the developers have for the game now is focused.<P>The sad part is, that the dev team is taking the support of this hideously unrepresentative element of the player populace as support for their false vision of the state of things and misdirected focus, while the FoH spokespeople are not even realizing the negative impact this focus has started to have on even their own game.<P>I posted an essay on the subject after it was first admitted that content was being designed around Donal's BPs, an item only perhaps half a dozen people per server had, if that, those people being in one or two guilds.  It was pertinent then and is even more pertinent now.  Though it's deep in the thread, I'll repost it.<P>This is not a cry about the Donal's Breastplate nerfing, this is not a call to get it undone. The Donal's breastplate issue has merely shed a light on a long developing problem. Mudflation - you know the term, you know the syndrome. Please take a step back and look at the history of the bleeding edge of EQ. <P>The battle between the developers to challenge the elite players and the elite players to "beat" the game in EQ has been a long one. It's really been happening since the very beginning, but started to get heated when the first big guilds begain to kill the dragons regularly. Initially, only a tiny, tiny amount of guilds on any server were able to kill dragons - the results were twofold. First, these guilds ended up harvesting the dragons regularly, having minimal competition, and as such because more than well equipped with loot that was above and beyond anything available to the rest of the populace. Second, the better equipped they got, the better tactically they got, the stronger the dragons were made. The "bar" started to get raised for these people, yet the rest of the population was NOT rising as fastly - only those capable of killing the dragons were doing so, and only they were starting to equip themselves with the items that were making them powerful enough to justify the increased difficulty of the dragons. <P>Then the planes open, and the spark of mudflation that started with the dragons exploded on both fronts. Fear (later Hate), a vast new zone of such difficulty that it challenged those already boosted far above their lesser brethren with the loot won from dragons, but also filled with loot of astounding potence, making the dragon stuff look like junk in comparison. Soon, the same guilds that were harvesting the dragons were now harvesting planar armor and equipment, god loot at the time almost unimagineably good. These guilds buried themselves in the bounty, not just themselves but their alts/twinkies/mules... Those that couldn't, which was pretty much all but one to three guilds per server, weren't... The mighty got mightier, the devs responded, killed drop rates AND made the planes more difficult. And more so.. and more so... and the drop rates got lower.. and lower.. Those who were there first, already a class above the rest of the populace due to their hordes of dragon loot were now even further ahead, bedecked in full planar gear. <P>In time, many many more guilds became strong enough to kill the dragons, venture into the planes, but it was not the same.. dragons were tougher, rather than one guild dominating every spawn, or two or three battling over them, it was many, many guilds fighting over two dragons. The planes were not the same places.. those who were there first still dominated and swept them at will, the rest were stuck bickering with eachother over the scraps, scraps coincidentally which were far tougher to kill than what the initial plane pioneers faced and far poorer in reward than they once were. The elite first ones were decked down to their mules in full or near full suits of planar armor, only needing to harvest more as new members joined, or new alts were born, the rest were struggling to get entire guilds full of people a scrap or two of the planar goodies... It was ugly.. <P>Then Kunark came out.. and the promises had us all excited - a handfull of new dragons, not just the two old perpertually slaughtered duo of Nagafen and Vox.. whole zones for the 40+ crowd to play in.. but what do we see? The new dragons are so powerful only the initial harvesters of vox/nag and the planes had a chance to kill them - new, wonderful armors and equipment, but the prize pieces, the breastplates and leggings, where were they.. Trakanon and Venril Sathir... and to whom were they available.. drumroll.. the same people who were there to first harvest vox and nagafen, that small small percentage of the populace in that small small subset of guilds. This was where the mudflation had gotten out of hand, where the barrier between the haves and the have not finally cemented itself. To this date, how many guilds per server have killed Trakanon, how many have killed Venril Sathir? Short of ebay and the VERY RARE trade, this same number is the number of guilds who have obtained Donal's breastplates, or other such Kunark right clickable class armor breastplates. And this is what, TEN months after Kunark's release? Let's not even mention Veeshan's peak..<BR> <BR>Now we have Velious - while Kunark was a bandaid for overcrowding, the factions an utter mess (Venril Sathir faction? jeez.. what a horrible mess, where was that deep storyline it was supposed to be a part of), the quest content largely empty and/or broken, the zones well.. sloppy, and incoherent, without a finished feel, many dungeons still devoid of players.. well, while Kunark was a bandaid, Velious was obviously designed with love - deep, interesting, rewarding quests, a beautiful (at surface) faction triangle with a storyline behind it... but it was not designed with the average player in mind. The faction triangle while initially accessible to the majority of players hits a wall when you get to the royal factions - the quests available to the average player, well, what few raise tormax or yelinak faction do so minimally - given that we start at scowls the quests might as well not even give faction, they won't be of use. How do we raise faction with the royal factions of Kael, the Dragons? Easy.. kill the royals of their enemies - who can do such things? Ding! Only that tiny tiny subset of guilds who have been on top from the beginning (though they might have changed faces, names, reformed and redistributed the players among them, it's still that same small handful of people at the heart). The rest of us? Out of the loop, scrounging for scraps in Great Divide and Eastern Wastes... And what about all those wonderful zones for high level players? Well, they're only for high level players who can get through Siren's Grotto.. and those high level players well.. ding, you got it, back to the same handfull of guilds per server..<BR> <BR>Finally we get to the heart of this Donal's breastplate thing... You finally admit that you are designing content around this one item, granted as per your admission, only a handfull of boss mobs were specifically made with this in mind, but it's time you look at all of velious, all top level content, and look in a mirror and ask yourself, really, who are you designing it for? There are a LOT of players level 50+, but is this 50+ content designed for them? I say the answer is clearly no, it is designed for only what amounts to an aristocratic minority of them, a miniscule subset who, while outstanding in their accomplishments is a tiny, tiny, tiny percentage of the whole population. <BR>This is not an attack on uberguilds - they are not some evil organization out to get the rest of the player population, they are people, just like the rest of the player base, people, players who take what has been layed out before them, and use the tools that they have earned to take advantage of it. It is not their fault that the content is skewed in their favor, they don't make the content, they just play the game.<BR> <BR>The problem here lies clearly with you, the designers. You seem to have blinded yourselves to the actual makeup of the player base. I don't know why it has happened, but that it has happened is painfully clear. If anyone Brad, given your long history and well respected knowledge in the arena of MUD type games, you should have been aware of the threat of mudflation, prepared for it, but clearly somehow, some way, Everquest has truly fallen victim to it. Get a grip on the problem, and throttle it, get back in touch with those of us who play the game. Not just the few lucky ones who figured things out at the beginning, organized themselves well enough to consistently stand at the pinnacle of success in the game, but the rest of us, who, less organized, less driven, have been basically struggling along, wallowing in the wake of the bleeding edge elite created by your efforts to challenge them without sight of or consideration for the rest of us. Retune, revamp the 50+ content for the average 50+ player, group, guild, disorganized band of ruffians, whatever they may be, not the elite. If they win, if they "beat" the content you created, good for them - it's not a defeat for you, the more happy players you have the more you win, content which only a small subset of the population will ever truly enjoy is not a victory, it's a defeat, a loss of vision. Get back in touch with us, please.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>And the point is, the game is broken beyond repair. All current adds are causing a snowball effect. Mudflation? This game has redefined mudflation. They have this incredibly weak foundation upon which they keep adding features and nerfing other features. The nerfs, however, remain like scars, increasing the height of this tower. Right now we're on the 102nd floor and its a LONG LONG way down. The only way to fix this abomination is to demolish the whole damned thing and start from scratch - enter EQ II.<P>People make valid points in this thread, I won't argue with the content of most, I will argue, though, that the problems posted are well beyond repair. ANYTHING done to 'dumb down' the game will cause powerplayers to swarm like locust to said deficiency. We're like sharks, we can smell blood in the water a mile away - believe it.<P>Look at AO for example. There are already level 50 players demolishing level 150 encounters. That would be the equivelant of a solo level 15 bard killing the Ghoul Lord.<P>Result: You CANNOT tune to the casual player. Like I said before, you don't dangle the carrot at the donkey's midsection. You dangle it in front of the nose.<P>Any scenario you could possibly come up with, I could come with 50 more that would involve my character and another doing what it takes 18 of you casual gamers to do, faster and more efficiently. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

There will ALWAYS be a subset of player who will ALWAYS beat the game.  ALWAYS.  And tuning to that miniscule subset is the heart of mudflation, what has gone so bloody awry with Everquest, what has left all but the top handfull (being generous there, really one, two or three) guilds per server playing the meat of the game, and ALL the rest living in their wake, on the scraps.

</FONT><HR>Bogmog, that is exactly the reason. Mudflation would be ten times worse if they tuned to your casual player. I won't rehash why, it's been done in this thread a dozen times. The encounters aren't designed so UBER can do them, they are designed so UBER have a damned hard time doing them if at all.<P>If they put Yelinak loot on some mundane mob that you and 17 of your buddies could kill, do you HONESTLY believe you would ever in your wildest of dreams have a shot at that mob? Heh, I can with 100% certainty guarantee that said mob would be dead before you got home from work, EVERY SINGLE TIME. <P>There is NOTHING you can do about it - plain and simple. <P>Secondly, Verant doesn't want said items to enter the world at such a rate. By tuning to casual players, powerplayers would destroy that schematic. You CANNOT WIN THIS BATTLE.<P>If you want it, you have to pay the price - price in the context of EQ is time. Sorry, that's life... it may or may not be flawed, but there is nothing that can be done to fix the problem. <P>You can continue to cry to Verant and Absor, however, it won't do a bit of good.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't think there is any zone (other than neriak and a few other zones due to faction) that any person with the desire or want will not be able to go to.  Sure you will need a great guild for this, but anyone who plays with any seriousness will get their just desert when they reach those lvls.  I myself found the most difficult levels (so far) to be the 20s.  Too many places to go and not enough people to go with.  I took me about 6 months (spent sometime testing out classes) to get to 25.. I has taken me about 4-5 months to get to lvl 47 nearly 48.. My toon has grown up prekunark and prevelious.  There are zones that i've looked forward to going to since kunark came out. And i WILL see them when i am ready.. but seeing these zones are just the chocolate iceing on the cake.. The game is not built for everyone to see and do everything with one toon.. If it were people would get lvl 60.. do whats left to do and quit.. i don't see myself quitting at the 60th lvl.. i see my adventure beginning<P>Perdan Pureheart 47th Erudite Paladin<BR>The Karana Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Heh, I can with 100% certainty guarantee that said mob would be dead before you got home from work, EVERY SINGLE TIME."<P>You're dead wrong.  Dead wrong.  What you describe IS the status quo, that IS how it works.  All the "uber" mobs are still being harvested by a few guilds as soon as they can, with the most uber being done at the guilds leisure.  What gearing more towards the average big guild rather than the Uber guild would do would frankly subject the ubers to competition.  Something they frankly have not faced save from one or two guilds of their ilk per server.  They would still get many kills, BUT they cannot be in all places at all times.  <P>Your prophecies are frankly pathetically false.  With others having a CHANCE at these mobs, even if many spawn at the same slow rate, the ubers will NOT get them all.  Do you think you can muster the force to kill every single "uber" mob after servers come back up simultaneously were they geared for lesser guilds?  How many people do you have at the moment - 45-55?  How thin can you spread them?  The uberguilds will still get a great many, because of their levels, their organization, but they won't be able to jealously guard their piece of the pie as is the case with Trakanon and a lesser extent Venril Sathir.  We already see this with CT/Innoruuk/Antonican Dragons.   Well, until Verant's FUBARing of hate and fear go live.  <P>Oh, btw this has nothing to do with how quickly the loot is entering the world, it has to do with how many hands will be able to dip themselves into the fountain.  No one's asking for the pie to be changed, just for everyone to have a chance at the pieces.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am going to try this one more time ... not for Verant, but for you, er, people, who don't seem to be able to understand the English language, or don't want to.<P>(1) No one is asking Verant to eliminate content for the fanatics.<P>(2) No one is asking to obtain in 20 hours what someone else gets in 200 hours.<P>Are you with me so far, or should I repeat it again?<P>WE WANT STUFF IN THE GAME FOR NON-FANATIC POST 50s TO DO.  And we want enough of it, since there are a heck of a lot more of us than fanatics, we love the game just as much, we are just as dedicated, and we pay the same.<P>Is it just to much to ask that I could get in, say, 400 hours, what you ubers get in 200 hours?  In fact, don't even let me get the same thing, let me get to 60-70% ... I can live with that.  Is that ok with you, or does it threaten your uberdom?<P>Don't be telling me to leave ... I am not interested.  I am a cash-paying consumer, and I can darn well ask the producer to serve the needs of myself and people like me.  I am HERE.  I have a large investment of time and energy in being HERE, and I plan to do everything reasonably possible to stay HERE. If I, and most of the others in these threads, didn't basically love the game, we would not waste our time. That's how capitalism works folks.  You don't have to leave ... you can try to exert influence.  You can expend effort to try to influence a producer of a product to tailor its product to serve the needs of ALL of its customers.<P>And for you people who are bothered by this, again, I am not interested.  The difference between us is that I am not asking Verant to deprive you of what you want, but for some reason you don't want Verant to satisfy the needs of people different from you.  That's the element of this game that totally baffles me ... this group of people who simply can't be happy that they succeed ... they can only be happy if others also fail.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"Now, as for "Epic Quests" ... come on, SURELY you realize there are 100 ways to do epic quests that have NOTHING at all to do with involving an Uber-raid. It could involve rare drops off of MOSS SNAKES and FIRE BEETLES that drop so infrequently as to limit the creation of epic weapons to 1 a month. You could find 1000 under-hunted creatures no higher than level 35 throughout the world, set up special drop tables, and have ubers combing Rathe Mts for Lizard Warriors for months looking for rare drops .. or hunting FISH in Lake Rathe for weeks."<P>You could, but then you'd have to dress up the game in a skirt and call it Sissyquest.  What you are talking about is entirely different game.  I'm not a particularly big fan of Diablo myself, I prefer CONTEXT to my rewards.  That is, I enjoy the fact that specific mob x drops item Y because tatooed on the side of that item is a sign that reads "I killed mob x for this!"  What you are proposing is like playing the lottery.  Oh boy, another bum whose never worked a day in his life just won 50 million dollars.  Great for him.  Meanwhile I've busted my tail half my life to break even.  That's fair?<P>Get this:  In Everquest, the players who play the most, GET THE MOST OUT OF THE GAME.  That's just how it is and how it will always be.  I happen to think that's a good thing.  I like it so much I've played it for two years.  You obviously don't see it that way.  You think players should just win the lottery and get a +25 vorpal Hackmaster after killing their third moss snake.  That doesen't sound like the kind of game I would stick with very long.  That's about as far as this conversation will ever get.<P>Anyway, pretty drunk, hope that came out okay.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The players who play the most in lengthy blocks of time with large groups of people get the most out of it.  Other players can play enormously more time and wind up with emormously less.  The game rewards straight time up to about level 50.  Thereafter, it only rewards time devoted in a specific manner - a manner not possible for most people.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>Ok, since people are so fond of analogies:<P>There is a kindergarten with a play area, and the school builds some shiny new swings in it.<P>From the get go, the same 4 children elbow the others aside, duck out of classes early, and trip the other kids up, and monopolise these swings.  The other 96 children are left to cluster forlornly around a broken teeter-totter.<P>Fair enough if this is an isolated or occasional incident, but it continues to happen every day.<P>Should the teachers allow this?  Apparently the teachers' stance is "Well, if you were just a bit more adept at elbowing people, you could be one of the 4", or "Well, if you made the CHOICE to cut classes, the uber-swings would be available to you".<P>(For all the "lame duck" thinkers, the teachers are Verant in this analogy).<P>What has yet to be realised by the Uberguilds is that the majority of players, who have been disdainfully dubbed "lame duck" players by a member of FoH, are actively subsidising the elite.<P>Without the revenue generated by these "lame ducks", there would be no content at all, uber or otherwise.<P>Perhaps whenever there is a new server, Verant should simply take all the Uberguilds from every server and dump them on the new machine.  See which ones CHOOSE to invest the time to be the uberest of uber, and which ones are happy with their newly found second-class citizen status.<P>How are things on Ayonae Ro these days btw - everybody happy?<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065833-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065833.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065833-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065833-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065833-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/065833-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=065833&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=065833&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
