</FONT><HR>Here is the most current version of my wizard spell idea:<P>It would be a nice effect if we could channel our magic through a warrior's sword.  If you've played Chrono Trigger, you may remember the double-technique "Spire" where Frog would stick his sword in a critter, then Chrono would zap lightning through it.  I'm thinking we could get a "buff" spell to cast on our party members that would "proc" on the next successful swing the meleer got with an ULTRA-low possibility for resist.  The "buff" would cancel immediately upon that swing.  It would need to be ultra-efficient for mana with like a 5:1 ratio of damage to mana.  The rationalization for the low resist is similar to the "lightning-rod" aspect of the "Spire" spell from CT.  The warrior cuts through the flesh, and opens a conduit for the wizard's magic to pass through.  Perhaps the spells could even add a minor resist debuff effect. (The resists would have to stack with our LowerElement spell from Staff of Temperate Flux, though)<P>Here is my idea:<BR>(Lv16) Freeze Blade: 60 mana/180 damage (-5 vs cold)<BR>(Lv24) Ignite Blade: 110 mana/330 damage (-5 vs fire)<BR>(Lv34) Electrify Blade: 160 mana/480 damage (-5 vs magic)<P>(Lv44) Blade of Ice: 200 mana/800 damage (-10 vs cold)<BR>(Lv49) Blade of Fire: 250 mana/1000 damage (-10 vs fire)<BR>(Lv51) Blade of Lightning: 300 mana/1200 damage (-10 vs magic)<P>(Lv55) Sword of Blizzard: 500 mana/3000 damage (-20 vs cold)<BR>(Lv58) Sword of Inferno: 600 mana/3600 damage (-20 vs fire)<BR>(Lv60) Sword of Wrath: 700 mana/4200 damage (-20 vs magic)<P>**Note**  <BR>In addition to the resist debuffs, these spells should save like lures when they "proc".<BR>**/Note**<P>Yeah, so the names might need work.  Just think about how these spells would help out in Velious encounters.  These spells would NOT unbalance wizards in solo-play as they would be unusable.  These spells can ONLY be cast on a blade-wielding character, and CANNOT be cast on yourself.  They can also ONLY be cast on a group member, and would be level-restricted like the post-50 buffs.  These spells would not only make wizards more useful in raids, but would also add to the value of meleers.<P>Anyhow, this is just one of my ideas.  Please consider it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cool.gif"><P>Read more at my other thread found at:<P>[url]boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/051035.html[/url]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One interesting thing is that people are requesting a berserk type effect for wizards...This sounds interesting.  <P>What would happen, say, once a wizard gets to a certain % of hp (let's say 10%), that he goes into a Panic, and his body starts producing rips or tears in the mana fields, causing periodic damage to the mobs around him, for a specified time length...<P>This might actually help the wizard, since if he's dying anyway, he might as well be doing a self-defensive damage....This would actually go in line with the statement definition of wizard, that our damage is are best defense.<P>And if that damage that he produced would stun mobs, instead of crucially hurting him, he might actually have a chance to run away to safety.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wizard are overpowered solo.<P>Wizards suck grouped.<P>I still don't have a problem getting a group.  Why?  Here's a typical evening of gameplay:<P>A_MONK_01 tells you, "Hey Hey Vab what you up too?"<BR>You tell A_MONK_01, "Quad kiting sarnaks for xp"<BR>A_MONK_01 tells you, "Want to go to lguk?"<BR>You tell A_MONK_01, "Was just there couldn't find a group"<BR>A_MONK_01 tells you, "I got us a cleric and chanter, I REALLY need FBSS come on we need you"<BR>You tell A_MONK_01, "Sounds great! meet you there"<BR>A_MONK_01 tells you, "Right on!  can you pick me up in GD first? then we have to get cleric in Nek, and chanter is in DL"<P>Now why did I find a group?  Cause they neeeded a FRIGGIN RIDE.  Once we get to lguk not one of us really wants a wiz there, including me.  My forte is solo kiting, I just don't bring enough to a group, especially in a dungeon.  Nobody wants to evac when cleric can res, even with SRo evac so close to lguk.<P>What we don't need:<BR>- percent damage spells... *** are you guys smoking<BR>- more damage... we are talking balance here <BR>can't believe you are asking for this<BR>- faster mana regen... can't really do this for wiz without throwing them out of whack with the rest<P>What we do need:<BR>New spells that are more group friendly that don't give us more power (we will not get the power we were expecting at creation, since Verant wants that balanced with other classes at end game)<P>Types of spells I think they should give us:<BR>1. mana effecient damage shields - don't know why we didn't have them from the start... doesn't give us more solo power, good for group, seems like a no brainer to me<P>2. AoE stuns - don't think any chanter would complain we are crossing into their turf as I'm sure they wouldn't mind somebody else sharing the aggro with them, and they are already working overtime... again does not in any way give us more solo power, and helps greatly in a group situation<P>3. single target snare - something that would be a great boon indoors, area snare pulls extra mobs through walls/floor and in tight quartes you snare yourself... this would again help in a group, maybe make it shorter duration so it doesn't increase our solo ability<P>Wizards flat out suck in a group.  All this talk of more power is not helping the cause, wizards need group friendly spells.<P>Without new group friendly spells, stick to quad kiting, skip the velious uber mobs, farm items and twink a rogue.  That's what we're good at.<P>Vabann Loosecannon<BR>45 Wiz<BR>Vallon Zek<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Low Level Wiz issues:<P>Most people are addressing the high level issues.  Being a Level 15 Wizard, I'd like to address some issues for us low level people, which can make Wizards extremely discouraging in the beginning.  I understand that the Wizard is intended to be harder in the beginning than most classes, but I still think someone should take a real look at it (Try actually playing a non-twink ERU WIZ from levels 1-16 with no guild/freind help).<P>The first thing is regarding solo play.  Since Wizards are harder in the beginning, and EQ is somewhat group oriented, Soloing a &lt;16 Wiz is almost impossible.  I've done it a lot, and I suppose it is doable, but it is very, very, very tedious and boring<P>Root, Nuke, Nuke, Nuke, Nuke.  Then you get XP and you sit and med for up to a few minutes solid... then go take one more creature....  That's assuming you didn't die because root was resisted or failed early, which happens way too often, resulting in a lot of lost XP.  Possible solutions (and I know there may be a lot of issues here I'm unfamiliar with making these impracticle) would be lowering the mana requirements of the level 1-8-ish nuking spells, upping the mana regen rate for low levels a little, or making root a little more effective at these levels.<P>I feel it should be possible, and not so extremely difficult as it is now, to solo a Wizard at these levels.  Not to mention the fact that since we spend so much time medding, at these levels people tend not to like us in groups, because we slow them down (as compared to having another class along with them).<P>---<P>Also, while someone useful might be looking, I'd like to touch on a generic issue (for all classes) that really gets me ticked at EQ sometimes:  The LD Penalty.  For those of who play on modems, it can really suck sometimes.  Granted, EQ plays better than most other realtime games on a modem under normal conditions... but there's always those "Bad Modem Days"...<P>On a Bad Modem Day, we may average a mere 10-30 minutes between disconnects.  We have to deal with lost time, aggravation, and possibly death and XP loss if in combat.  There's not much to be done about that for obvious reasons.  But the LD Penalty that seems very fixable is the Summoned Items and Spell Effects.  Modem users who go LD seldom get back in before the character auto-logs off.  Then when you do, you lose any summoned items and any spell effects which die on logout.<P>Possible solution:  When a character logs out, don't destroy summoned items and don't kill spells until 5 minutes have passed without a logon... this should cover 80%+ of the cases.<P>Also note that the Groups are still bugged (Bug: If leader goes LD or anything else funny, the group is stuck, and all group members can't leave or join a new group until they log out and back in).  The same LD Penalties with regard to Summons/Spells affects people logging in/ou right quick to kill this bug and get into a new group.<P>Thanks for your time reading this,<BR>Brandon</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>The biggest issues I see with wizards and generally pointed out by others are:<P><BR>1. Tremendously low damage output versus mob HP ratio in Velious.<BR>*New spell lines that are Velious only are interesting as well as the idea of spells doing a percentage of the mobs HPs. More mana, faster regen of mana (self while medding or increase in shield regens), more mana given by Harvest (how much mana does Harvest give us @ 60 and do you REALLY think that is enough to make a difference). The most interesting idea, besides better mana regen, is the percentage of mob HPs spell as it is useful across the world of Norrath. If it were to do 5% to Wuoshi, that might be 1600 dmg where as for an HG it would be 125 dmg or so. With lower level mobs, it may not be as useful as Draught of Fire, but against higher HPs mobs like Wuoshi, etc it will certainly help. The bottom line of this spell is, with a low mana cost of say 200-300 with a decent cast time 4-6 seconds, it would make us more effective against the new mobs in Velious with the extreme amount of HPs.<BR>2. Teleport locations being hazardous.<BR>*Nuff said on this one, the locations, for the most part made sense in the old world. They just got plain wacky when Kunark opened up. I have never used Skyfire evac and never will unless it is in a safe area. Was this on purpose? Who knows...<BR>3. Spells being difficult to obtain for the level they suggest can use it.<BR>I agree that CT shouldn't be given at it's current level or that the tp point should be moved to Feerrott. Concussion, OMG. I will not go on about these as they are obviously in need of looking at. However, I fear the solution for concusson will be it becomes a spell only useable from, say, Level 52 on instead of changing the location of mobs. And concussion it one of the MOST useful spells I have ever gotten, saved my butt BILLIONS of times. I can be a little more aggressive in a group instead of worrying about taking up my clerics time and mana.<P>Interesting ideas I have seen:<BR>1. The spell a wizard can cast on his group that gives everyone IN HIS GROUP a one shot proc when attempting melee, OMG! I got excited when I saw this suggestion, anyone got a large towel?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Fantastic idea! It can be a line of spells, like fire, ice, lightning and magic that you get with increased level. Man, I would love playing the wizard again if I had this line of spells as it would allow us to be more effective to the group, giving them more damage output, increasing our desirability in groups, while not imbalancing PvP or solo ability. <BR>2. Getting a familiar. I have seen various ideas about this and the most viable seems to be a non-pet that increases your damage output and or acts like a necro, feeding you mana. There are a TON of neat ideas that could be done with this and we would not have a pet that does melee, another GREAT idea indeed! This has so many good points to it, please give that a toss and see what sticks.<BR>3. Although this would affect only a very small number of wizards, the effect on the epic weapon, IMHO, is a joke for wizards. We do DD, plain and simple, make it a USEFUL, clickable DD. Doesn't have to be overpowering, in fact, a hard to resist type spell like a 350dmg lure spell would be great, similar to the Sorcerors Robe, but with a more reasonable casting time. Make it cast quick but be long to recast. <P>These are all I can think up for now that fall in the range of "balancing" but the wizard's biggest problems are being wanted in groups. Those problems are based, at higher levels, on being useful to the group. We are not considered useful, for most encounters because of the damge versus mana issues. Taken into consideration with the fact that the only other thing we can do is port people around, it isn't very hard to imagine the core of our complaints. Help us with increased damage output, or give us more group friendly capabilities. I would prefer to be more useful to a group as it is infinitely more interesting to group, than to solo. I really like the "Familiar" idea, the "Percentage of HPs" DDs and the group spell that gives a one time proc to everyone' melee. All of those would certainly make us more group "friendly," wouldn't they?<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is in responce to absor's posts about wizards being second in ports because druid are the "Masters of travel"<P>From the everquest manual:<BR>Druid. A Druid is the master of the outdoors and befriends all flora and fauna. Creatures rarely ever attack him unless he attacks first. He is a clerical spellcaster who focuses on all things natural, allowing him to call upon nature for aid and defense.<P>Wizard. The wizard is a seeker of knowledge, and her life is spent focusing on this goal. She uses powerful spells to see things from afar and *TRANSPORT* them between places. A thirst for arcane knowledge has made her a master of defense, as well as an offensive force of destruction.<P>Now then, as you can see Druid's description says NOTHING about transporting their butts anywhere. They are more of a hybrid between shaman and cleric, with a bit of ranger dashed in. Wizards on the other hand are accepted in ever fantasy book, movie, game, etc to have the ability to teleport where and when they whim. Moving existing gates is obviously dificult, and adding new ones more so. How about a little compromise?<P>Spell Name: The seven league stride<BR>Skill: Alteration<BR>Mana: 150<BR>Castingtime: 5sec<BR>Description: Teleports the wizard and his group to a specified position within the current zone. Example: <BR>Butcherblock --&gt; Kaladim gates<BR>West Karana --&gt; Qeynos Hills zone line<BR>Lesserfay --&gt; Steamfont zone line<BR>Oasis --&gt; SRo zone line<P>The points would be set up going out from the wizard gates. For example NRo has a teleport point, so the stride would take you to the oasis zone line, stride in oasis to the SRo line, and stride in SRo to the Innothule swamp zone line.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>I apologize for repeating some ideas in my post.  I hope duplications just confirm certian issues.<P>Sorry this is gonna be a long post, I have lots of ideas and well this is a good time to share them.<P>A little about my background in EQ.  I have a level 60 wizard (my first and main character), 52 warrior, 30 cleric, and have played most other classes to level 20 or so.<P>Let me just list off in no particular order some issues for wizards (some are balance issues and some are comments).  Thanks EQ Staff for looking into these issues.  I will try and post some positive aspects as well.<P>My basic perspective on wizards is we were fine pre-kunark.  Magi, necro and enchanters were too powerful pre-kunark so verant upgraded tanks (and thus healers who could help tanks) by adding more hp, skills, ac items, and weapons.  DD mana/damage ratios were little changed and thus all int casters suffered.  Wizards were balanced before and then post-kunark were way too weak (except in a few slots).<P>1. Wizards are NOT masters of damage (over time or speed)<P>post 50 - almost every tank class (esp warrior rogue monk ranger) with good gear can easily outdamage wizards over time in a group or against a boss mob.  Duel wielding classes can even do more damage than wizards in a short ammount of time with the wizard using all his mana.  Wizards cant usually unload all their mana at once anyway even with brain bite or they get agroed and die/waste healer mana.  Thus, nuking fast is not only not doable even chain nuking but you dont want to chain nuke for agro reasons.<P>pre 50 twinked - wizard just suck, with fungi tunic any melee class can solo to 45 in about 6 days played with good weapons not being powerleveled.  Weapons can be traded down (I know I give away "junk" drops in gfay after raids to non-twinks) helping lower level melee classes but not int casters.  The longer a server matures the harder it is for wizards at lower levels (since twinking does not really help them).<P>pre 50 not twinked - I leveled my wizard on Brell before twinking took place (first twinked smr on brell was when I hit level 50, no mith 2 hander had yet droped),  wizards hold up fine.  I never noticed a problem but then again the tanks I grouped with did not even have yakesha until level 45 or so.  EQ is more of a twinked tank world now.<P>2. Balance issue 1 - wizards versus magi<P>Wizards and magi nukes are about 100% equal until level 51 with draught and 52 with lure.  Magi get pets.  Wizards get portals and steelskin line.  Magi get dam shields and some summoning stuff.  To be honest, portals might be a fair trade for pets.<P>3. balance issue 2 - wizards versus druids<P>Druids do everything wizards do except lures, steelskin line and int caster shielding line.  Druids do about 1000 more things such as regen/heals, sow, dot, etc etc.  Druids are hitting 950ac in my guild with SoV items while int casters are locked at 650 (max I have herd of is around 750 for an enchanter in full effriti armor from the plane of sky).  Other than lures at level 52, wizards SUCK relative to druids.  Also add the fact wizards get no class specific items and druids seem to have a class specific item on almost every boss mob (ct, vox, nagy, trak, shields from kunark dragons) and in verious dungeons (ae stick, regen stick, fungus tunic in sebilis, kunark armor, shields from sov dragons, PoG quests, kael wis caster drops).  Why play a wizard over a druid?  So you can lure boss mobs at level 52?  Hard to say this is balanced.  (/em awaits the onrush of spoiled druids to flame him)<P>4. No INT caster loot in kunark or sov worth much.<P>Yes, items motivate people to go places.  Meleers and wis casters received full sets of armor in kunark and upgrades to the armor in sov.  Int casters got nothing in kunark and the sov armor is often worse than plane of fear/hate drops.  I appreciate the fact you cant add ac to int caster items for balance reasons but the int/mana upgrades are small and actually negative in some cases.<P>5. Wizard clickable items are a joke<P>Wizards only have nukes and self buffs - EQ has be shy to put nukes on items so they stick with buffs but for wizards that means we get useless items.  Examples:<P>Diamond Encrusted Staff - 2hb - 20 sec casting time on Elemental armor (a 100mana self buff), gee the time I spend equiping a 2hb over my usual items I could have cast this spell, not including the 20 secs I have to wait for it to cast.  This staff sits in my bank, cant even trade it due to it being so bad.  You know how insulting it is to ge this from venril sathir relative to cobalt legs for warriors?<BR>Nek Portal staff from city of mist - 2hb - 20 sec casting time, exaclty like above<BR>Sorcerer panteloons - legs - elemental armor - I admit I use these 15 sec casting time on the same but only because I wear them (not the mana/int is lower than loam pants I had before).<BR>Staff of temp flux - great item, best wizard item in the game even though it does not do alot.<BR>PoG wizards robe - 30 sec casting time for a 330 damage lure spell is just a waste.  just cast lure for 4 secs then med for 26 secs and you should hae more than the mana back from lure<BR>Cazic Thule rod - 1 charge evac to ct - instant casting time - LORE - usable from inventory slot (useless otherwise) - this item rules if it had more charges, instant evac saved me from death a few times, would love to see rods like this with a few charges<P>6. Spell drops not equal to caster loot<P>I love killing gore or sever or lodi or woushi and having the same level 60 spell drop again I had 6 months ago.  My reading of loot in kunark and sov are that spells are supposed to be int caster loot.  First, wis casters get spells like int casters and tons of items which is a balance issue.  Second, in kunark, only 2 spells from loot are useful and only at level 60, lure of ice and sunstrike.  Evac, 51 stun, 55 stun dont add much at all to the wizard.  All the other spell drops are junk.  Third, invis to undead, improved invis to undead and translocate are the only spells of value in sov for a wizard but dont add any power to the wizard.  Meanwhile all the other caster classes seem to have gotten spells that actually upgrade their power in kunark and sov.<P>6.5 (forgot to say this) plane of sky items stink for wizards<P>wizard bracer NEG 5 int 50mana 50hp - well this is just an insult the magi and necro bracers have as much mana and hp and no NEG int.  Suggestion that NEG 5 int 150mana would make it a really nice item -  Why is it ok for paladins to get 15ac neck slot, all melees get haste items, other int caster bracers are good, clerics get weight of the gods shoulders and wizards get this?<BR>PoS quest items are all sub par except for solodite mith ring<P>6.7 (another forgotten issue)  AC items versus int items at high levels in expansions<P>kunark and sov added ac/stat items for meleers and int items for int casters.  This just unbalances things.  int/mana items effect the LEVEL of mana a caster has not the regen rate.  AC/stat items effect the damage RATE meleers take.  Increasing int/mana does little for an efficient nuker since you never sit at full mana.  This new int/mana items basically do nothing while ac/stat items continue to increase the power of tanks.<P>7. Loot suggestions<P>Focus objects like for pets but for dd fields - might be hard to code but long overdue, 1% at level 30 drop, 5% level 45 to 15% on boss mobs in sov where they increase damage output for a field of dd spells - could have fire, cold magic focus objects<P>Sorry for the loot ramblings, back to some other issues<P>8. AE spells<P>player burst - static pulse line - great post level 52 - could make the ones pre 52 faster casting and a little more efficient<BR>al'kabors - hehe tons of people alreayd noted how bad they are<BR>others - pre 54 they stink, pillar at 54 is decent and I know a few wizards who started quad kiting at 54<P>9. non dd, portal, ae spells<P>Steelskin line is great - only necros have this - should be a little more powerful than runes imho<BR>int shielding spells - great except now high level monks and sk and warriors get these from items<BR>Invis and levitate and see invis - great spells though invis becomes useless at around level 50 for high level dungeons which in effect hurts invis casters<BR>Elemental armor - nice line of spells<BR>All the other spells are junk and add wasted space to my spellbook<P>10. Wizards and groups<P>At low levels wizards stink at soloing (go watch wizards die trying to root nuke in oasis) and are bad group members.  At mid levels, evac starts to be used sometimes and is the main reason wizards would get a group.  Same at high levels.  Almost always a druid would be picked over a wizard for backup healing and evacs/snare.  Wizards also snare so with no druid around wizards stop nuking and become snare beasts but because of the duration of bonds of force *atols stinks for the fizzles* it really hurts the ability of wizards to nuke.  Many wizard friends of mine end up kiting not because they want to but because they cant find groups.<P>11. wizards and raids<P>In all instances a well equiped warrior will be much more efficient for a raid than a wizard for damage dealing and they can taunt as well.  Lure makes them good for boss mobs in kunark but tanks now outdamage wizards even on boss mobs.  Lures seem to still get resisted sometimes on boss mobs but I have not done a through check of it.<P>12. wizards and soloing<P>Necro, magi, druid, shaman, enchanters are all alot better at soloing than wizards.  Wizards can solo though esp at high levels with jboots though it ends up being, kill one mob, med for 5 mins, then go find another.<P>13. Wizard epic completion rate<P>The hardest epic quest with close ties to sk, necro, magi.  SK would be as hard but many high level sk have soul leech already from ct so dont need that for their epic.  Do you know how painful it is to try and kill ct 20 times to get a skin?  I helped kill ct about 15 times before epics were put inot the game.  My guild has all full plane gear.  Frankly, the placement of the int caster rare drops makes getting the epic easier for a level 49 wizards with no plane gear on a "nice" server than someone level 60 who plays often and has a guild to help do quests.  56% of my guild has epics.  Everyone but all the int casters (except one magi, one necro and encahters) and 1 bard and a few warriors has their epic.  Warriors and bards will have theirs soon since a good group of level 60 can kill gore in dreadlands and the queen in chardok.  But we respect others on our server and do not hog plane of fear or hate.  If this is what you intended, then fine but just be aware of the fact you placed the int caster loot drops on mobs that were obtainable by anyone level 46 plus where they actually have an incentive to clear the plane (plane armor) and level 55 plus people are very bored of the zone and those friendly level 55 plus players will never see it.<BR>On another note, on Brell 0 wizard epics (average across servers is about 1 wizard epic per server - see my post on graffe's forum for counts over the last 3 months).  Clerics are 15, monks 15, ranger 8, druids 6, sk 2, necro 1, warrior 2, magi 2, rogue 7, enchanter 10.  I suspect this a fair breakdown across servers too.<P>On a positive note, the 3 staffs from phinny, vw quest staff and the one from the tola powder, are nice and many wizards have at lest one of those.<P>14. Wizards in guilds<P>"portal boy" is a good way to describe wizards.  Its about the only important role for wizards currently in the game.  No one cares about our nukes anymore just that we help get people to and event and from an event.<P>15. Spell suggestions<P>A. faster low level nukes around level 30 - draught line for mid levels<P>B. one or two lures at level 20 to 35<P>C. level 60 magic dd for about 1500<P>D. level 55 big nuke<P>E. better player burst ae spells pre level 52 - cant use them soloing anyway<P>F. all mana/dam ratios better or make focus objects as loot to do this (about 1 to 25%) would even us with tanks for damage output<P>G. more spells like translocate - portal target to wizard bind spot perhaps (might unblanace quests as I think locations are one way you make quests time consuming)<P>H. Faster evac spells as levels increase, evac spell casting time does not change for a given level, this should be easy to adjust and something helpful<P>I. New DD effects - low taunt dd, freeze dd (like a debuff on target), dont know why wizards were limited to pure dd in EQ<P>J. DD that funnels through tanks - ie cant be used in soloing - add a proc to tanks, add a poison effect to the tank that is a dd of great mana/damage ratio next tiem they hit<P>K. the % of hp dd is an idea - not sure it is needed<P>Anyway, thanks for looking into wizards.  Not sure there are easy fixes for this class on the weaker side of balance.  I believe wizards were balanced pre-kunark and have fallen greatly in power since then to be one of the least powerful classes (next to rangers).  Without portals and lures, wizards would be a totally useless class.  I suggest adding some more fun and useful wizard loot, tweaking pre-50 spells for wizards a little, and adjusting dd somehow to make wizards useful beyond portals and lures.

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;What we don't need:<BR>&gt;&gt;- percent damage spells... *** are you guys &gt;&gt;smoking<P>This was an idea thrown out for help fighting a single type of monster, the Velious SUPER BEING that is magic resistant and has hundreds of thousands of hitpoints.  Desperate times call for desperate measures. On any other creature in the game, this type of spell is not going to be efficient or used. I'm not saying I support it either, but don't think its *** crazy.<P><BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;- more damage... we are talking balance here <BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;can't believe you are asking for this<P>OMG---read the entire 12 pages on this on the first thread and then the 3 on here. We are talking BALANCE here too. I can't believe you don't think its called for. "more damage" is not what you think it is. We are currently doing less damage than warriors, monks, rogues, necros, magicians, rangers, shamans, and possibly bards in 98% of the game. 1% on raids in Kunark where we rock, and 1% being raids in Velious where we are doing nothing in terms of damage along with necros and mages. (side note make post called "casters unit against SoV--enchanters excluded")<P>&gt;&gt;- faster mana regen... can't really do this for &gt;&gt;wiz without throwing them out of whack with the &gt;&gt;rest<P>How? Read the entire posts again and look at the numerous mana helper type ideas...some of them are quite smart. We're not asking for a breeze or clarity (although I think I saw that once)...just harvest increases or a larger mana pool just as warriors get a higher hp pool, as the only "true" melee.<P>"Sometimes a person thinks she's seen all the way to the bottom of the well of human stupidity.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Having read all the other posts let me put my 2 cents worth in. <P>To truly balance the wizard class, one must look at the other caster classes and determine what makes a wizard fun and unique. Why play a wizard when I can play the other classes?<P>A wizard first and foremost has damage spells, true to form they have all types of elemental damage spells, cold, fire, and magic. Most of the best wizard spells do not require you stay in line of sight with a target like a bolt spell does. This is why even though mage spells come close to wiz in damage, they aren't better. I can live with that. Lets look at what other things wizards can do. They have a whole line of sight spells, which are totally useless except in very special situations. Not only that, only the gaze line of spells are unique to the wizard, the other classes have some or all of the other spells. This is the major problem right there. If a wizard is the "scout" of the caster class, then give them unique sight spells only THEY can use. Spells like Eye of zomm can be cast be a number of other classes too. What was the reasoning behind that? This is true for spells like root, damage skins etc. All repeated in other classe. So what defines a wizard? The answer is, their damage spells. As someone mentioned, we are the warriors of the caster class. Pure magical damage with no melee abilities. Give us then spells to make this possible. Right now as it stands there are NO monsters in any of the worlds that are immune to physical damage. However tons of almost totally resistant to magic creatures. Until the line of lure spells came out, the wizard was completely useless in these encounters. After the lures came out, We seemed like the people in the spotlight in on raids. But the big truth is, if you take a log of any big raids and parse them, ALL melee types do more damage over time than a wizard. If you compair wizards to warriors, they pale in comparison in terms of ability. Warriors can do alot of dmg to mobs and are great offensively and defensively. What they give up is utility. Wizards give up defense, concentrate on offence and yet still lack alot of utility. One way to make wizards more balanced should be either more defensive spells, OR more shorter duration low damage, low agro, low casting time spells that are equivalent to a warrior attacking. For example. A high level warrior attacks for 50 dmg 4 times on average per round. Why not give a wizard a spell that can be cast that fast and does almost as much damage? It can be partially resisted but due to the fact that it is low mana and low cast time, you can ignore resists here and there. That is the first step in making a wizard shine in combat. In other areas, the problem isn't that the wizards are not good, its that compaired to some classes, they aren't good ENOUGH. Some classes like necros, can do EVERYTHING, from dots, to pets, to dmg, damage skins, illusions, res, invis, invis to undead, harmshield. Here you have a class that does every thing all the other classes can do, and in most cases they can do it better! What kind of balance is that? I agree that mages have balancing issues as they lack root/snare line of spells and in most dungeons, PET = death. So make their pets follow orders better, with better control. More functionality to their pets would make them less dependent on their damage output as we Wizards do.<BR>Enchanters are actually fine the way they are, they are a great class to play and very balanced in my opinion. Druids on the other hand are also very unbalanced. Their Damage is not as high as a magician or Wizard but it is just as efficient, combined with damage shields and dots, A druid can do MORE damage than a wizard can over time. Add to the fact they can gate like wizards, snare, root, and TRACK, its no wonder they are the most played class in all of the game. I propose that instead of nerfing any class like necros or druids, look at every class and make them as useful as necros or druids. Leave only ONE defining spell/skill unique to each class. Here are some defining class skill/spell examples: Warriors master of offensive melee skills, Rangers the master of ranged attacks, Rogues the masters of stealth attacks, Monks master of defensive melee skills, Clerics masters of the life/healing. Druids the masters of shapeshifting, Enchanters masters of illusion, Bards the masters of song magic, Mages master of elemental pets/dmg shields, Shamans master of dots/stat buffs, Necros master of death/undead, Paladins the balance of melee with healing, Shadowknights the balance of melee and undead mastery. Lastly that would make Wizards a master of Magical damage. Make everyone able to do everything except the defining ability or spell. Melee types should for example find teleport pads in each zone that make travelling easier, to eliminate the current throttle of druids and wizards on travelling, While wizards should get spells like harmshield/divine aura... What I proposed is I think what the original design of the game was supposed to be about, but somewhere along the line, the lines were muddled, and the balance lost. I hope you guys can find it again.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, if the wizard class is supposed to be balanced at the very high levels, then shouldn't the class be balanced at the low levels as well?  Why should ANY class be weak for the first 30+ levels compared to melees, but then be balanced with warriors/rogues/monks when we hit the level 50 to 60 range?<P>So, what wizards need is increased damage output at lower levels, perhaps a DoT spell(fixed rain spells that are single target and move with the target and don't get resisted 3 times out of 4).  This would do a LOT through the early levels.  Balance should NOT be only about level 50+, it should be level 1 to 60.  If a level 5 warrior can easily solo stuff, then the other classes should have things to balance against this.  At level 30, the classes should be balanced.  At 40, the classes should be balanced.<P>Also, line of sight spells should work properly.  If I can see a mob, but it's upstairs and looking down on me, I should be able to cast on it.  If I have gaze spells to extend my line of sight, then my spells should apply to them.  Seeing a mob in the water and casting should NOT give me a "you cannot see your target", and then make me lose my mana.<P>I'm not saying the other casters shouldn't get looked at, but the wizard class doesn't have enough utility to compensate for the weaknesses, both in the lower to mid levels, as well as for the issues with Velious high level mobs.  As I mentioned in some other posts, a DoT spell(not poison based), would do wonders.  Perhaps an unbreakable root spell, or more low resistance root spells would help.  Things that other classes don't get.  AoE root would also be nice.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Another thing I was thinking of that may cross into what other people have suggested:<BR>A once a game day ability like the paladin's Lay of Hands. Some kind of spell, in line with a wizard's purpose, that can only be used once a day and is completely uninterruptable while not using any mana (just like Lay of Hands). A group evac to a safe place near a zone? A nasty DD for it's level similar to "Disentegrate" in that it does an insane amount of damage (40%?) that is used in emergencies. Make it so it doesn't effect the "who gets the exp" aspect of killing a mob. In other words, it can't be used for KSing anyone but will drop a mob in a hurry in an emergency situation. <P>"Alaadin begins to shake as a tremendous, pent up force strains inside him" (ok, no dirty stuff here  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ) <P>I don't know for sure, but I bet someone can come up with a workable idea from this...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I saw this in another thred it's a good post and covers alot... enjoy.<P>__________________________________________________<P>Seeing as quite a few classes have been recieving attention on these boards recently, pertaining to some of their long-standing gripes about their class, I thought I would offer an opinion about my time as a wizard. This is my first time posting to this board. I refuse to flame, yell, and scream, and prefer to discuss problems civilly. So please don't reply to this message if your only contribution is "D00D U R SUX".<BR>I've played since beta 4. I was a wizard in beta, and I've been a wizard ever since the game went retail. Having said that, I'm only a 55 wiz, as I'm not the powergaming type and I like to try other classes/races as well. Regardless, I know the class as well as almost anyone who plays a wizard, -- I speak from experience.<P>First, we are a pretty decent class. I'm actually quite satisfied. We can solo well at the higher levels, do a pretty impressive amount of damage through most of our career, and the travel abilities are very nice. I don't want to say we "suck" by any means. There have been *very* little changes to our class post-beta, and we're still pretty effective a year+ later. I think that's a sign that we're pretty balanced.<P>That having been said. ("Uh, oh" Absor says to himself.) Because our class hasn't been touched much since post-beta, there are some pretty glaring issues and rather embarassing problems with our class that have been around since the game first went live.<P>1. Al'Kabor spells. Al'Kabor, the (supposedly) most powerful wizard in existence, who has an entire line of spells named after him... what an absolute embarassment. I know of NO wizard who can keep a straight face while actually discussing these spells. I even see them being auctioned in Freeport by other classes as "(Whatever) of Al'Crapor," the pet name most of wizzies have for the spell line. The mana to damage ratio on these spells is, for lack of a better word, a complete joke. Let's compare:<P>Level 51 - Pillar of Frost<BR>750damage or so to 4 targets, 325 mana, 10ft radius of effect<P>Level 51 - Something of Al'Kabor<BR>720 damage or so to 5 targets, 650 mana, 35ft radius of effect<P>Twice the mana for the same damage (with an extra target), and a slightly increased radius of effect is NOT worth it under any circumstances whatsoever. Period. For over a year now I've searched for a way to use these spells effectively without success. At lower levels, the discrepancy in damage/mana compared to spells of the same level is even *more* exaggerated - to the point it's laughable. I've been in hunting groups in Seb, etc, which simply *destroy* the Ak'Kabor spells looted without even *asking* if anyone wants them, because they're notoriously useless.<P>2. Enstill. We're given this spell at level 20, and then given the news that our level 4 root is now no longer going to hold critters as it has before. (At level 20, the effectiveness of root is *severely* reduced. It's sudden, not gradual. It's definitely a "message" from the gods to anyone trying to use it, that it's time to do something different.) This is apparently to encourage us to use the new Root-based spell.<P>However, Enstill is almost as much of a joke as the Al'Kabor line. At level 20, against a level 20 mob, it is easily resisted 19/20 times. When it *does* stick, if a fly so much as breathes the wrong way on the mob, it breaks. If a spell cannot take effect 90% of the time (and I know the propensity on this board to exaggerate percentages and stats - this is not an exaggeration), and then is completely ineffective the other 10%, it's useless to us. It simply isn't worth the research time invested.<P>3. Gates. Most are great. One is embarassing and two are deathtraps. When we are given the Skyfire and Cazic gates, gating into either location is instant suicide for a wiz of that level. The Cazic gate aggros immediately (this was supposedly fixed to not happen any longer, but it still does), killing any young wiz who appears before they can react. The Skyfire evac is similar. The Tishan's and Markar's Relocation line (the Kunark evacs) are an evac line - they cost the same mana as an evac, have the same effect as an evac (chance to leave someone behind), and the same casting time. WHY is one of them designed to require vast amounts of preparation, buffing, and strategy before it's safe to zone in there? The evac point for Tishan's is *literally* in the *middle* of one of the most heavily-NPC-trafficed, high-level areas of Skyfire, right by the Veeshan's Peak orb. There's no reason to "evacuate" a group to their deaths.<P>Also, the West Karana and North Karana wizard spires are sort of amusing. They are located on opposite sides of a zone line, 30 seconds' run from one another. In the entire zone of West Karanas, one of the biggest, emptiest zones in the game, why oh why is our wizard platform as far east, towards the NK spire, as it can be? Why have that platform at all?<P>One of the reasons that Qeynos is so underused by the average population, is that there is no druid/wizard drop point nearby. Freeport has the WC ring/spire. Qeynos has no druid ring, and a wiz spire which takes a full 15 minutes' run to reach at SoW speed. Moving the useless WK wiz spire closer to Qeynos Hills would do wonders for Qeynos' popularity as a city, not to mention Halas, Everfrost, Blackburrow, and Permafrost.<P>The WC-to-Freeport run takes 5 minutes. The WK-to-Qeynos run can easily take 15. With all of the (obvious) development time put into Qeynos (it's the quest capital of the world, and one of the most complex and detailed cities) I would assume the dev team would be looking for ways to make it a bit more frequented.<P>---------<P>Now, on to some more general issues. (Not quite done yet, please bear with me.)<P>The Draught Lines and Pillar lines post-50 are a godsend. Thank you thank you thank you. Draught is unbelievably fast, mana efficient, and useful. The Pillar line is amazing as well.<P>Lure used to be the crowning achievement of our class. The spell that got us invited on raids. (Being invited to only do *transport* for a raid doesn't count - that's just insulting.) They were supposedly changed so that the "type" of lure would determine resist chance. If this is working as intended, that's great. Unfortunately it isn't. Any mob of higher level than the caster is getting a high chance of resisting lure, regardless of the type, at the moment. Similar to any other spell we can throw. At nearly twice the mana as comparable nukes of the same level, this makes Lures rather useless. Please oh please fix this bug. The news that Lure no longer works well has spread like wildfire across EQ. Many uberguilds, if you look at their websites, have stopped recruiting any more wizards. That's a fairly effective way of determining the class's desire post-50.<P>It's been mentioned before by GZ that giving us O'Keil's Radiation (the 2dmg fire shield) at level 4 was a mistake left over from beta. Why then cement the mistake at level 30-something by giving us an equally useless spell, O'Keil's Flickering Flame, in Velious? A 5dmg fire shield at level 30-whatever is pretty amusing. I'm not sure why it was given to us. Some sort of more useful, personal buff instead would be much more in-line with the rest of our spells. Was this a mistake? A joke? It's a good one, if the latter. I can always get a good chuckle out of groups by casting it.<P>Atol's Spectral Shackles. Great spell... when it goes off. I'm not sure if it's intended or not, but at level 55 (it's a 51 spell) with a maxed Alteration skill, the spell still has the propensity to fizzle 4-5 times before going off. The problem is, it tends to "chain fizzle." Waiting 10 seconds after a fizzle is almost guaranteed to work, whereas trying to cast immediately after a fizzle is almost guaranteed to have it fizzle 5-6 times. Is this intended? Is this spell *supposed* to fizzle so incredibly often? I know many many wizards who refuse to use the spell, instead relying on the level 29 Bonds of Force, instead, just for this reason.<P>Harvest. It's a great spell. Very class-defining. I love it, other classes are envious. Well... until the high levels. Harvest from when you get it (level 34 I believe) up to around level 48-50 is great. It's scaled to give slightly more mana each level so you get the same "percent" of mana back (roughly 3/4's to a full bubble of mana) regardless of your level. However, it apparently was never scaled past that point when Kunark came out. After 50 it gives less and less. At 55, my Harvest gives me a quarter bubble of mana, if that. At 10 minutes a cast, that's less effective than the 1-mana-point-a-tick Manaskin. I've had relatively the same gear since 34, so my mana pool hasn't artificially inflated at all. I know of many wizards who bid a fair farewell to this spell in their lineup at level 45 or so.<P>To wrap up, an overall class complaint. Pre-Kunark, wizards were very well balanced. Post-Kunark, as far as Kunark material was concerned (levels 50-60, the higher mobs like Trak, etc), our effectiveness was reduced relative to other classes quite a bit. Melee types were given better gear. They could last in fights longer. Many classes were given special armor (Cobalt, Donals, Singing Steel, etc). Wizzies got, well, basically nothing. There were a lot of class-specific stuff added, but nothing class-specific for wizzies. All of our items were in the broader, "caster" class. This isn't a wiz only complaint -- many caster classes felt left out as well.<P>In Velious, the problem isn't the phat lewt. The problem is, the hitpoint cap on uber-mobs has gone through the roof. When you have a class who's sole purpose for existence is dealing a HUGE amount of damage, fast, to kill something before it annihilates the out-of-mana wizzie, this is a problem. A full tank of mana, our only source of damage, doesn't even NICK a Velious uber mob. Once our mana is gone - that's it. We have no pets, no melee ability, we can't heal, buff, etc. We can nuke for a sliver of damage, then we're through. Out of commision. Meanwhile the tanks keep on tanking, the rogues keep on ripping through the baddies with their Ragebringers, (incidentally dealing nearly as much damage a second as a wizzie can deal chain-nuking)...<P>Wizzies, on these raids, end up doing the least amount of total damage to the mob than any other damage-dealing class there. The *anti-thesis* of what our class supposedly should be about.<P>And last, but not least, our epic item. A count was done on Graffe's Wizard Forum (the most popular wiz class site on the web), pooling everyone's knowledge about how many wiz uber weapons are inexistence across the servers. We arrived at the number "13." Across every server. The ONLY reason for this insanely low number is ONE item - Cazic Skin.<P>Where other classes' uber weapons require huge packs of friends, planning, skill, and epic battles, ours revolved around one item which requires nothing but mind numbing tedium. To place an item on a 1-week spawn mob, which is ALREADY camped and killed within hours of his spawning even *without* the epic weapon taken into consideration, is silly. To make the item drop chance on him so low that only 13 have dropped in all of EQ is ridiculous. (Nevermind the question, why does Cazic only have his skin 1% of the time anyway?) I can think of few other uber weapon decisions so poor, except for perhaps the Mage's reliance on Quillmane in SK.<P>This isn't a question of "skill" or "time invested." It's a question of luck and frustration invested. That's simply not fun. I know not everyone can have an uber item. I would gladly give up the chance of ever personally getting one to have this fixed. But please, please, please... please have this epic weapon rely on something other than luck, months of camping, and strong-arming other Fear guilds out of the way. It does nothing but create grief for everyone who ever wants to hunt in Fear. And an item which does nothing but introduce grief and hatred into the game isn't worth it. Introducing an item into the game which does nothing but piss off thousands of people (most of whom aren't wizzies), with almost no benefit to the server in general, is pointless. Ragebringers, Chanter sticks, Water Sprinklers - they're all wonderful ways to invest your time, for the individual as well as the guild helping. The reward is great, and it's a way of encouraging cooperation and teamwork. The wizzie weapon requires strong-arming hundreds of players out of Fear, and upsetting a large number of people. It doesn't encourage teamwork. It doesn't require any skill. It doesn't encourage cooperation. In its current state, it just encourages emnity and hatred.<P>I apologize profusely for the length of this post. It's hard to write about all the issues you've stored in your head for over two years, and be succinct.<P>Any and all rational, intelligent comments are appreciated.<P>-Atrius Lannister,<BR>55 Wiz, Mith Marr<BR>__________________________________________________<P>Arcaniden Manastrike<BR>53 Channeler<BR>Bertoxx<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I know that Absor doesn't need yet more input from another nuker, but here goes....<P>Addressing the wizard travel thing, adding an extension to the Yonder line that pops the wizard in the direction he/she is facing (make it the next spell level up from the random) would help with the wizard travel issue.  Yes, by the Yonder level version it would be faster than SoW, but it would also use mana for each hop, so the wizard who uses it would arrive depleted...  how's that for balancing risk with reward?<P>Mana regen - Again, wizards take forever to recharge.  Would a higher-level upgrade to Harvest be out of line?  Either same mana for a reduced recasting time, or more mana for the same or greater recast time?  <P>Damage output - I really like the % damage idea.  It would make wizards a valued part of a group again at higher levels.  If you're worried about four wizards using this to reduce the ubermob to dust with this, have the spell do a percentage of the ***remaining health*** so that repeated castings of the same spell do less damage each.  Makes it much more useful at the beginning of a fight, less useful after the tanks have bashed it down a bit - wizards will have to carefully balance the taunt factor with this spell!<P>My wizard character is a mere 20th; I play him when in a mood to solo, and currently plan on retiring him to a taxi role around 40 or so because he won't have another purpose in this group-oriented game.

</FONT><HR>*********<BR>BALANCE<BR>*********<P>This thread is intended to focused on balance. And so, I shall...<P>1) Dealing Damage. Wizards are un-balanced post-50 at dealing damage. Quite frankly, they are outdamaged by anywhere from 5 to 8 classes, depending on pulling environment and group composition. I can post data if you like, but you probably won't have time to read it all.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> The rate at which a wizard regains mana, and the corresponding damage-over-time yielded by a wizard regaining lost mana and subsequently casting nukes, is much lower than the damage kicked out by melee classes. Especially in the upper levels. <P>All this is true, despite the fact that dealing damage is wizards' *primary* class focus. Imagine if Clerics' ability to heal dropped off, or Druids' ability to kite dropped off. <P>So, in the higher levels, wizards are but a TERTIARY contributor of damage, who can toss in roots, snares, and evacs. That is their role, and it is a depressing anti-climax from earlier levels.<P>Solution: By far, the best that's been suggested is the percent-of-total idea. Add a nuke that hits a mob for 10%, 20,% or maybe even 30% of it's CURRENT total HP. This will enable wizards to perform their specialty on bermobs, as well as on any high-HP Velious critters. To keep the spell in balance, give it a 1-minute (or even 5-minute) refresh time. It won't be un-balancing, since it would be based on current HP and not max HP (100 wizards casting this spell won't kill a mob).<P>2) Brain Bite. This spell was a great move toward balance. Only problem--it does NOT balance wizards below level 45 or so. If Brain Bite itself were purchaseable, that would help. Even better... add a Brain Bite precursor somewhere around/below level 20. That will help IMMENSELY. Please look into it.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>These two items will greatly help wizards, in some areas that many believe to be Unbalanced.<P>Gratefully,<BR>Simryd L'Drael<BR>Wizard of Quellious, Saryrn<BR>46th Season</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I would have had a lot more fun with my Wizard if some changes had been made earlier on:<P>Wizards should be doing noticeably more damage than any other caster, at any level, with the added aggro to match.<P>Wizards should have lower resists on roots and the roots should last longer.  In turn, the root should break easier if the mob is taking damage.  There is no reason any other caster should have the same root spells as us, unless at a much higher level.  A lot of times it is the difference between life and death.<P>Mobs should resist Wizards less than any other group, because it is the only way that we can help in a group.  The lure line was a good idea, now just make it work better. <P>Wizards should be able to dodge before 22, and they should always be able to increase the skill.  This would make a gate or evac spell a little easier to get off.  I can not remember how many times I have died to a green mob that any other class could have soloed.<P>I think the best thing that you can do to make a Wizard more desirable is this: <BR>Make it so that every time a Wizard hits a mob with a DD spell there is a chance that the mob will be momentarily stunned.  Maybe not as long as the current spells, but make it noticeable.  Keep this ability unique to Wizards, and let the frequency of it go up as the Wizard spells become more powerful.  <P>I have spent a lot of time thinking of these possible improvements, please take them into consideration.<P>Thanks,<BR>Mavrin, Wizard of the 46th Season<BR>Moment of Clarity, Erollisi Marr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just as a reminder, some keep trying to say that certain percentage spells would be too high. Percentage damage spells are NOT CUMULATIVE!!!! Each successive cast will do FAR LESS and LESS damage. The spell would be based on the CURRENT mobs HEALTH, keep in mind, all the group is doing damage the whole time. And that being the case, no matter how much or how few, the mobs health is, only so much can be done to them, and essicentialy even on a 1000k mob (if it even exists), multiple castings by multiple wizards isnt viable useful.<P>Another thing people seem to neglect, spells of this nature can, and im sure WILL, have serious reprucutions, i will give some example to these possiblities:<P>Agro - I can promise if you cast first, you will be the first target to die, even after some damage has been done, your still dead if you arnt careful , or dont have every single tank taunting. (again a good group would be the only thing to let you live)<P>Mana cost - A high yield damage spell like this, you can bet will have a extream high casting cost, an estimant would be a 2% damage spell costing 500-1000 mana. It wont be cheap.<P>Recast time - You thought Harvest lasts awhile, you can be assured this may have a similar recast, although on those long fights it may be cast again, but it will have lost all efficency by the time it could be recast. Again this spell would only be useful in certain situations...ie its not an everday spell.<P>Resistances - You think it will act like a lure and be almost completely unresistable? I doubt that, although one would hope it doesnt get resisted in abundance, for if it did, it would end up in the back of the ol spell book like so many others.<P>I'm sure the balancing issues that the desighners are concerned with, can be kept in check all too easily with these factors.<P>Im not trying to be rude in how im explaining, im simply stating that the power of the " gods that be" can make anything work to a happy meadian for all with out causing balance issiues.<P>Just my two copper, on what i think would be the most useful, and potentialy the deadliest addition a wizard could recieve with out being over balancing. I ask you this, if we did have a 10% damage spell at lvl 60 (or a decent size percent damage) would their be any question we are a master of damage? We would indeed be a master of damage, but the price for our power can be garanteed to have an equal and possibly deadly cost. (hopefully deadly cost wont be needed, as so much can be done)<P>Again, just giving my thoughts and clarifying what ive stated previously.<P>Valgav Gaav 50 Wizard - Quellious (Eternal Honor Legion)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hey Absor why are we even discussing Wizards?  Is this another joke?? By the looks of Abashi, we were balanced way back in January 2000:<P>The Wizards are long overdue for an overhaul... fix the damn class!<P>We have no short term plans for an "overhaul" to the wizard class. I think some of the problems that people are having with this class is that they feel it lacks diversity. It does, and it supposed to be that way. Wizards are a very straight-forward class to play. <P>Wizards already get 3 out of the 5 types of spells in the game and can damage almost any creature. They get a new direct damage spell at every spell circle, and their spells have lower casting times, better mana/damage ratios, and lower recast delays than the DD spells of any other class. <P>Not to mention, they are one of two classes with group teleport capabilities, and the only ones able to teleport to the planes. Finally, the number of Wizards in game is substantially in-line with expectations. <P>Wizards are doing fine. <P>-Gordon<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I love playing a wizard. But at level 49, many people stop playing wizards because we are not desired in groups. I don't do enough damage to a mob to make me desireable and yes, I do have enough stun spells to keep me busy in raids, but all they do is get me killed. My stuns do damage and if you stun enough since I can chain stun, is get summoned.<P>Enstill sucks as a root. Creatures break it very easy and it does not last as long as root did.<P>Immobilize sucks as a root. Creatures break it entirely too quickly (faster than Enstill) and it only lasts for 1-1/2 minute tops. Though the faster casting is nice, it is not worth carrying.<P>Bond of Force - AE of this spell is too much. We snare ourselves many times, and it does not last long enough to finish a fight sometimes. When we start to recast the mobs have run away and aggro more.<P>My level 49 nukes take too long to cast. 6.3 seconds to do 1110 pnts of damage that is resisted 90% of the time is worthless. I don't even mem Ice Comet anymore. I use Rend if I use a 49 nuke at all. I am not asking for more damage here, just less casting time and less resist. This is where we are SUPPOSE to come into our full power. I don't see it.<P>Level 39 Concussion - I would love to have this spell, but I need  a group to get it . . . .<P>Absor, the reason you are hearing nothing but bugs is because it would really help if we knew what the "VERANT VISION" was for our class. I have to admit I have no idea. I use to think Nuking and dealing out mega damage was it, but when when I hit 49 and saw 6.3 casting time, I was greatly disheartened.<P>Someone told me the other night that Wizards are not needed even for ports, because Druids have more "USEFULL" Port locations. So that cannot be it.<P>Wizards are suppose to be the masters of Direct Damage - NOT. Other Classes are so close, it is not worth doing. You can play a magician whose nukes are damn close, throw in a pet and there you have your nuker, plus he/she has a pet to absorb damage.<P>I don't believe anyone was complaining about the amount of damage that Wizards were doing before massive changes were made to classes. I mean everyone expected Wizards to come in and kill it. Well you nerfed that. Now Rogues, Rangers, Monks and Warriors with good weapons can do so much damage that even nuking with our most damaging spells they out damage us. So why have us in a group. Just get two Tanks to do the same damage.<P>You want us to be balanced? Give us our Role 1st. Then we will give you ideas as to how to best balance us. <P>It is too late to change melee damage. But one thing you can do to make us desirable in groups is to create new Wizard spells that cause massive amounts of damage (More than we do now) along the lines of the way Ice Comet use to be for us, but make them usable in Dungeons and certain zones only. <P>Example: Ice Meteor - level 52 - Casting time 5.0 seconds (group friendly here) - Direct Damage 1400 usable only in Kunark Dungeons where the average monster level is 52+. That might help us get groups more.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The ONLY reason I even bother with my wizard at all these days is because I don't have to deal with pets or buffs.  If I wanted pets and buffs I'd play shaman.  I just want to be a good nuker and porter.

</FONT><HR>Being a post 50 Wiz, I can say that Grim has pointed the areas where wizards need  improvements. All I want to do is post my opinion.<P>Pre-50. <BR>Mostly we do ok here, if you solo. Groups, hmm, very rarly, mostly evac type of groups. I understan why. Why bother with a pet less mage when u can get one with pet? Are mages over powered? No! I think it's wizards who r underpowered. One simple example. When wiz runs out of mana, wizard meds, same for mage + pet beating on the mob. So, why should group pick a wizard who cant do crap for them but to slow them down and annoye with "OOM" messages? So, this is not a big problem for pre 50 wiz. Why? We can find zone and ways at these lvls to solo. Hell, if i cant group in a group oriented game, i might as well solo. VI probably is very pissed with us for that. That AE nerf they working on will bring wizards one more step closes to become exticnt in the game. Enoff of pre 50. We can survive in these lvls pretty much because we can still find a zone where we can solo. <P>post-50. <BR>First thing i noticed. Fizzles, lots of fizzles. Spells i used for several lvls in pre50 lvls r now fizzling more and more and more. Post 50 splls, same thing. lvl 44 Arch shield fizzles 1-3 times now, *** is wrong here? lvl --&gt;12&lt;-- spell i used on bats to get some wings fizzled on me 3 out of 12 times. im 51 wiz. Now like Solaris said This is now cleric and MELEE game. I agree with this statemt 250%. Kunark and SoV mobs r a lot tuffer. Wizards help with those mobs is now nothing but a mosquito bite. Now mages are some what properly equipeed class for these mobs. (thanks to pets) Wizards can't even be counted as a rival to mages post 50. No way, no how. Now the problem i stated above is very obvious to everyone. If it was very hard to get into group pre50, post 50 is impassable, unless u start ur own with friends. Only thing we can give to a group is back up stun for those gate casting mobs, back up snare, back up evac. In others words who needs a stinking wizard when we got mages, druids, ranges, hell any other class would be more than welcome over wizards. We have become absolutely useless to group. And there r very few zones where one can advance soloing some blue mobs with major down times. Runing out of mana, being unable to contrebute any help with second, third, .... whatever mob is just few resons why wizards r at the bottom of the list. Finaly 2.2k mana at lvl 51 is nothing. I cant use IC, i cant use Rend, I cant even use Conflag (lvl 44 DD) in any Kunark SoV zone/dangeon unless it is filled with green cons. 1-2 of the above spells out me down to 50%-70% mana if i fizzle once. Now, that would be assist on 1-2 mobs(depending on which spell is used). Pull few more, im donw to 1%-20%. Ok, still got some mana, but wait, i got that evac memed meanig any pull can go wrong and I need that 20% mana to use it. So, on 4-6th mob Wiz is in, what i call, "default posistion" (aka meding) for a good while to get at least back to 50% so one can assist on a mob and stun that mob before he gates. This brings us to another problem. Magik resists. Stun r probably the most resisted spells cast by Wizards. We need somethign to improve that. Our DD's fizzles + resists will cut the above numbers but rafly 10% more. (i.e. wizard will be out of mana long before 4th pull!) We defenalty need a MANA BOOST. Selfclarity? No way. I rather a mana bunus. Like monks get thier AC bonus?!?!?!? I can see that help us. Specializations should b IMPROVED. It is useless untill u get 4-5 lvls on spell and even then is of no help. Improve via specialization our mana/(cast time and/or damage) ratio. That is improve mana/cast time or mana/damage ratio. Some one said that wizrds are 100% mana dependant. I would say 200% mana dependant. It's same with Warriors only with HPs. There r tons of buffs to raise AC and HP of all mele. Why cant wizard get that kind of buff? Why cant we cast a spell a self buff to buff out max mana by 100? 200? 300? or even 1k?!?! I dont see that as a porblem at all. We still need chanters to give us regen, we still need our INT gear to make that 1k be a bonus not a compensation. What else to we upset wiht that kind of thing??? We get to solo a blue mob with much mana in some uber zone?? WOW. thats impresive, but we done that since lvl 5! We could solo a mob or even 2 in most cases pre 50. That is why we were able to help in groups. If VI thinks that giving us ability to kill a mob or 2 in some 50+ zone will make us overpower, then i think wizards as a class shouldn't even exit. Post 50 we can no longer have that what if stuff. There are few zone that will allow wizard to solo that mob or 2. In most cases with 50+ mobs even given that wiz had enoff mana to kill 2 of those, I bet u my lvl 51 wiz that if 1 (ONE, that is O N E) thing goes wrong in that fight for wizard,(i.e. snare/root breaks early, or just a resist of the root/snare) that wizard is as good as dead unless he gates out ASAP. At 51 i got bout 1.08k of hps with my shield buff and several hp items. Add a diamond skin bout 400 more. Mob got bout 4k? Hits for dual 100s rafly. So, with 1.6k of hps it will take 8-10 hits to take a wiz down? Only thing i see me casting in that situation is GATE. I dont think there is a spell that will turn the fight around, exept for pure luck. Or may be a 2 second cast IC that cost bout 250 mana. Yeah, right, dream on. What every one forget is cast time when the speak of soloing. Cast time is second most important thing in soloing. With out a spell that can b cast in less time than mob's attack delay, only a perfect, let me say more, absolutely flawless root/snare blast tactic will work. Being this high in lvls and alot tuffer mobs Wizard class in all is not ready for them. We are still some what usefull on main land, but no where near ready RoK or/and SoV. We need a good once over to get us in balance with mobs we have to kill not with OTHER CLASSES we have to fight with. There is NO balance between classes. There should b NO balance between classes. The only balace that should EXIST is PC vs NPC. From here you can add classes to that balace by how much one can contrebute to and/or compensate a flaw in the other class(es). In a group based game, i think, that is the scale of balance.<P>Just my 2cp. Who m'I to tell VI how to balance the game right?  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't know why I am posting..seems like many wizards have posted already.. I think that I am just adding to the spam..But here are a few problems that I have seen.<P>1) Wizards are not at all useful in a group save the fact if we are going to do some uber mob in which only some of our lures work on them.  Most wizards for the most part have a hard time finding even a pick up group to get exp/lewt.  It takes about 10-20 min sitting at the zone in shouting for a group to get into a group(and even then that is if you can get a group to look at you)  That is why most wizards tend to solo.. I know for a fact that most of my guild's wizards end up soloing cause we would rather not waste our time sitting there trying to look for a group when we can be doing something that will get us exp.  <P>2)Wizards are not the masters of dmg, Pre-kunark we were the masters of dmg.  When Kunark came out and you split the dmg of the Ice Comet spell in half it seemed right..however we cannot out dmg a monk or a rogue at the same lvl(Not saying that we are supposed to be KSers), but what are wizards supposed to be?  I think that a wizard does the least amount of dmg because of the fact that we are not able to keep up in dmg with pets or with melees.  admittedly yes we get the last blast in to make the mob stop running and causing a train, but that still doesn't mean we get the kill for it.  I think that like the rest of the wizards here what is it that wizards supposed to be in the game for If not then why did you create the class?<P>3)Ports i think are fine, I am not suggesting any new ports.  I don't think that defines our class..<P>I would like you to concentrate on that aspect..my main thought is what is a wizard supposed to do in a group and what is the defining role as a wizard in gameplay altogether and if it is master of DD why is it that we do less dmg then most of the other classes?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I hate to break it to all wizards but all the requests about wizard deficiencies such as gates, mana, dd resists, yadda yadda and the improvements like making lures start early have already been addressed by Abashi...the exact wishlist:<P>It's obvious that no one on your end knows the frustrations of playing a wizard. I've tried several times to find out who at your end who is responsible for the 'Vision' (tm) has done so, so that we, the wizard class and talk with such a person, and discuss what needs to be improved with our class. Since you can't seem to comprehend my concepts in my posts requesting a dialogue between us the players and Verant. <P>Since you would not pay attention to my requests, or more likely, no one at Verant has taken the time to become more than 'familiar' with the class (meaning played more than 12 levels of it) I'll start by giving some basic facts about the problems with the wizard class. I will start with a supposed fact from Verant and then present the reality. <P>FACT: Wizards are supposed to be the masters of direct damage.<BR>REALITY: We are not. We barely outpace our nearest competitors and at several spell circles can be outdone by other classes. Furthermore, until level 52, there are many mobs in the game that we cannot even hit with direct damage, and since we don't melee, that means we are excluded from participating in those kills. Do you think it is right or fair to make wizards wait 52 levels, or approximately 65 to 70 days played, just to be able to fully participate? And, that doesn't even mention the level caps we had all the way up.<BR>  <BR>FACT: Wizards are supposed to get spells of all types to deal with varying resistances.<BR>REALITY: We often skip several spell circles before another fire/ice/magic based spell becomes available to us, so often we are forced to fight mobs with spells 12 or more levels below our present situation.<BR>  <BR>FACT: Wizards have teleports.<BR>REALITY: Most of them are pathetic, will get us or our group killed, or in terrible locations. When was the last time someone used the W. Karanas teleport site or evac? When was the last time a level 24 wizard safely teleported into Cazic? Considering how large the zones in Kunark are, why weren't more spots added?<BR>  <BR>FACT: Wizards are 'balanced' meaning that there is a compelling reason to play them or to include them in a group.<BR>REALITY: Unless going on a raid to the planes, there is no compelling reason to play a wizard. Time and time again we have shown you that wizards only slow down the rate at which mobs can be pulled and killed. If a wizard wants to save enough mana to participate in a fair majority of kills, that wizard is going to sit and med, and maybe use one or at most 2 nukes per mob. Anything more will leave that wizard OOM, with a 10 minute down time. That's not right.<BR>  <BR>FACT: Wizards need Bards and Enchanters just like tanks need healers.<BR>REALITY: There are far more possibilities for tanks to be healed than there are for wizards to get mana song or clarity. Simply put, there are seven classes that can actively heal, and all classes can bind wounds. Furthermore, tanks can increase their bind wounds skill post level 50, whereas wizards do not get a substantial increase in mana regen from meditation. Bards and Enchanters are rare on most servers, and consequently most groups do not have them. Therefore, most groups will skip over a wizard in favor of a mage or necro because even if OOM, a mage or necro pet can contribute to the group, whereas a wizard is worthless.<BR>  <BR>FACT: Wizards become more mana efficient as they progress through levels.<BR>REALITY: Wizards become less mana efficient as they progress through levels. At level 1, a mob that gave exp took 2 blasts with our level 1 spells, or about 1/3rd to 1.2 of our mana.  At level 51, a mob that gives exp requires nearly 75% to 100% or more depending on resists. And, the amount of mobs that we have to kill this way increases as we level. Furthermore, at level 1, it didn't take nearly 10 minutes to regain all of our mana. At level 51, it clearly does. Therefore, we are less mana efficient over time, because the mobs outpace our ability to damage them, and require us to med for longer, and longer periods of time. <BR>I could go on and on with the problems of our class, but I think that gives a fair bit of flavor to it. <P>Now, based on the above, what can be done to improve wizards? <P>GIVE WIZARDS A BETTER MANA REGEN RATE. <BR>This can be done by increasing our meditation rate per level to say 8/per level, an achievable quest for an item with the effect of clarity, or a spell with the effect of clarity. Make it a self only buff to go along with all our other self only buffs. Necros and shaman can strip mana. Melee's get haste. Wizards should get clarity. To be fair, I'd make something similar to mages, but probably not as fast a mana regen as the one I'd give to wizards, since they have pets. Giving us this ability will not diminish the role of an enchanter or bard in a group, as they are still very needed for crowd control and for helping the other classes. And, this will not make wizards more powerful, as in most cases the mana necessary to get off a good nuke is more than we can regen in any one fight. However, it will reduce our downtime and make us more group friendly.<BR>  <BR>IMPROVE OUR TELEPORT LOCATIONS.<BR>This really isn't a request so much for wizards, as it is for all classes. Wizards are the taxis of Norrath, so at least let us take our fares to decent and safe spots.   Move W. Karanas to the opposite end of the zone, towards BB. Move Cazic to the courtyard. Add several additional teleports for Kunark. Having to take 45 minutes to an hour just to assemble a group is often far too long. This applies for Druids as well.<BR>  <BR>IMPROVE CASTER LOOTS AND SPELL DROPS IN KUNARK. <BR>Verant has really shown how much they dislike INT casters compared to WIS casters. First off, for our first 50 levels, INT casters had to go around looting items to research many spells. These research items took forever to collect, often rarely fell, and cluttered up our banks. INT casters know how amazingly boring this concept is. And, as a reward, you gave us random spell drops off mobs, and even so, they aren't dropping! I've had over 4 days played in various Kunark zones and in all that time I've found 1 level 51+ spell, and it wasn't even for my class! And, I have yet to even find one INT caster item. Don't tell me that they are there....if they were in any of the zones accessible to level 51 players, they would have been found by know. However, there are tons of melee items giving them the effects of spells or unbelievable damage ratios. Where is the caster loot?<BR>  <BR>START THE LURE LINE AT LEVEL 29.<BR>Wizards are the most hardest hit by the inherent magic resistances that each mob has.  It is not right that wizards are excluded, unlike any other class, from various mobs because of the resistances. It is also not right to fix the problem with only post-50 sspells.  What about all the wizards under level 50?  Is Verant's attitude "the heck with those below level 50, we don't care about you anymore"? How about fixing the class, not just some of it.<BR>  <BR>GIVE WIZARDS A FIRE, ICE AND MAGIC DD SPELL PER LEVEL. <BR>We can hardly be called the masters of direct damage since often we are using spells far below our present level. Mages get one of each type of pet per level. They are the masters of pets. Wizards should get the same as the masters of direct damage.<BR>  <BR>GIVE WIZARDS A GROUP FRIENDLY ABILITY. <BR>You did this with necros, thus making them the kings of soloing and decent in a group. Wizards can't solo reasonably in Kunark, yet we are left to do so often because we are not group friendly. No one wants an evac in Kunark, as it is better to save the cleric and die in place so that the cleric can res you, rather than spending an hour or more reassembling the groups. Maybe allow wizards to bind melee types within 10 feet of any zone boundary. How about a group damage absorption shield? There are several good ideas out there, consult us and we can develop one that will fit in with the 'Vision' (tm)<BR>  <BR>FOR ALL CASTERS, BOTH INT AND WIS, REDUCE SPELL TIMES AND MANA COSTS AS YOU PROGRESS IN LEVELS. <BR>As this item says, this applies to all classes. Simply put, a level 1 spell should not cost any mana or take more than a half second to cast. If mobs below a certain level don't give experience, spells below a certain level should not cost mana or take long to cast. As a level 51 wizard, I have cast my gate spell thousands of times. I'm sure my char by now can do it in his sleep, backwards, forwards, with one eye shut and one hand tied behind his back. Furthermore, I seriously doubt that casting gate would be a drain on my char's mana, since he's done it so many times. How about this: Every level after a player gains a spell, the mana cost and time to cast it is reduced by 5%. Any spell 25 levels or below the caster do not require any mana, and casting times are reduced to either one or two seconds. <BR>Note: None of these things would make wizards all that powerful. Even the last one, which would apply to all casters, wouldn't do that much, as it is similar to things in the game (mage pets can cast level 39 wizard spells without draining the mage's mana, items in the game give out effects of up to level 44 spells--at least so far, maybe more). It wouldn't allow the wizard to do more damage, as it wouldn't increase the amount of damage we could do in any situation. However, it would make us a more viable and group friendly class. <P>I'm sorry all, but the wizard issues brought up in this post and others have been addressed in the past. Wizards are not broken, and I am indeed sorry if you do not agree with our stance. <P>- Gordon<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 10 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=050989&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=050989&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
