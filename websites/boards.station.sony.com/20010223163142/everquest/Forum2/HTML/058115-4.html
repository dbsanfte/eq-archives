</FONT><HR>I think I'd be happy if pets were simply usable by necros on raids.  My guild continues to increase the number of situations where pets are not allowed to the point we are never allowed them.<P>Generally the reason for no pets is they'll hit on the wrong mob and prevent mezzing.  Possible fixes:<P>Pet should be able to be put to sleep so that it won't attack anything no matter what.  This would be especially useful when players need to go afk during raids (which is why one necro made raid leaders decide no pets once again last night).<P>Pet should attack what the master tells it to and ignore all else.  Don't change targets if pet or master is beat on by a different mob.  Don't even add the different mob to the aggro list for attack after the current target is dead because that may not be the best mob to attack next.<P>There could be a command to assign a "primary assist" to a pet.  The pet would only attack things this primary assist decided to attack.  This would solve both the problem of pet changing to wrong target and master going afk as pet would only ever attack the primary assists target.  While soloing the primary assist could be assigned to the master so the pet would attack after you hit the mob with a spell.  Or not, as you think fit.<P>---<P>Ok, so we weren't allowed pets for the whole fear raid until the final battle with cazic thule.  No real crowd control needed here so we can have pets, right?  Wrong.  Raid leaders say no pets, because mob can poof if pet gets killing blow while master is LD (and LD in fact happened to about 10 people because the server couldn't handle everyone or whatever).  I tried to tell them that code had been added to prevent 55+ mobs from poofing no matter what, but nobody would believe me and they said it "still happens every day".  I don't know if it's true or not, but it either needs to be fixed or you need to get the word out to everyone that it no longer happens.<P>---<P>Pet pathing needs to be fixed so the pet always stays with the master when following as long as the master isn't outrunning it with sow.  I posted a number of possible fixes for this in another thread.  Hope you were reading.<P>---<P>So once again I sat for 16 hours on a raid at half effectiveness because no pets allowed.  Other then raids where some item I need drops it seems rather pointless to go on raids to help the guild out because I'm not really doing anything (maybe 300 damage to each mob if I bother to cast a high mana dot that gets 1/3 through by the time the battle is over) unless they're short on clerics or enchanters and I can redistribute the mana a little.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello all,<P>I am not a huge gamer person and I am certainly not a computer programmer so this may be completely far fetched.<P>Generally when I go on a big raid I get stuck (if I am lucky) in the enchanter group.  Barring Sebilis.  The one thing I have noticed is all I do is mana dump and try to get a drain off.  I don't know if is feasible but here are my ideas.<P>1)  Group Bond of Death.  For a group of casters that would be really nice.  As a necromancer I rely on that spell, and as far as I know the other casters do not have a similar spell.  It means that in a caster  group a necromancer would be really really nice.  It also means that as solo'rs it would not benifit us anymore than the Bond of Death that we use now.<P>2)  Fear immunity would also be nice.  I believe that it works off your MR.  So I don't know if you could make a spell that is more or less an Immunity to Fear and not further increase your MR.  Make it targetable/player only.  It really helps on big bosses that mass fear everyone.<P>3)  Poison and Disease buff that will be better than a clerics and overrides it.<P>Well that is all I have.  I hope that you can use this, I have been asking around to see if groups would like this and makes us more group viable.  Everyone loved the Group Bond of Death idea, especialy the other casters since we have about the same HPs.   <P>Krystarn<BR>51st Necromancer, Fennin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree with some peoples posts, and this is my thoughts:<P>Necros, before you could surpass level 50, were the best. Now we suck.<P>Verant has decided that we are too powerful, they are simply wrong. Necros are the soloing class, you have removed that. Necros are not for groups, you have mad e that the only way to get exp. Necros pets suck. Make the pets as follows: all pet spells will create a pet WITHIN ONE LEVEL of the original level of the spell. For example, Emisary of thule should creat a level 58-60 pet, and that pet should rock. Make it hit for what a level 35 spectre does, and make it cast. A level 50 pet for a level 59 guy that hits for 55 is worthless and shouldn't even be owned, ti's a waste of hard earned platinum. The Epic weapon looks like ass, works like ass, and is as hard to get as a nun's ass. You have crippled all our spells. WAKE UP VERRANT!!! do NOT turn into ultima online. MAKE THE NECROS GOOD AT SOMETHING, WE ARE NOT FOR GROUPS, AND SO WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SOLO. MAKE US GODS AT LEVEL 60, JUST LIKE OTHER VARIOUS CLASSES. i don't want to spend weeks and weeks of game time on a character to get him to 60 if he is going to suck. level 12 necros can't solo at all, in fact, necros can only solo in one on one situations. Anyone who says that necros are powerful enough or to powerful is either blind or a moron. i'd rather have a level 40 SK then a 60 necro, you are more useful.<P>if you read that and take it seriously, then i appreciate it. If you didn't, then you can burn for all i care.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I just wanted to post and say that giving necromancers significant increase in DD spells is not in the best interests in Norrath. I think that maybe you should look in the undead damage that they do and that might need to be addressed. And to Anwser Bril's concern about unresistable taps, and for those who think I'm threatened by it, no spell should be cast without some form of downside. This was a balance issue so it got fixed  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Its like a person pointed out, there were like 6  necromancers under 20 lvl that took out a HG I believe. So they reap the benefits from casting a unresistable spell on a mob they shouldn't have been fighting to begin with. If its true that necros still have this ability, then VI should consider looking over the way these spells work and make them so they can't be casted on 1.2x their own lvl on mobs. That will take care of that problem. <P>Also, its not a pet problem or a dot problem in SoV, its a design problem in the expasion to Velious. I do agree that pets were made to wet their pants on purpose so that there wouldn't be like 2/3 of the people playing a necro on each server. I remember when I went to a pvp server, that's all I saw, Necromancers!!! The necromancers are so badly designed and nerfed that the major class being played is a necromancer. I think not.<P>In sum, please don't give necros new DD spells. Maybe you can fix that skel form with ignite bones. But to bril, this class wasn't meant to DD at all compared to the other classes. You can't have both strong DoT line and want a strong DD line. VI knows this. Maybe if VI were to strip all your DoT line for more DD power, then sure  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>Just play a wizy then. hehe<P>Pluto</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Pluto,<P>I dont know what thread you have been reading, but it obviously isnt the Necro thread. I did not read anywhere in these threads where Necros are asking for more powerful DD spells. Somehow your mind has picked up some misinterpretation and stored it as a nugget of significant information for you to draw your spoutings from. Necros dont want more powerful DDs. We want our Lifetaps to land. Comparing a Wizards worst DD to a Necros best Lifetap, the Wizards spell is stil more efficient. It uses less mana, casts faster, and does more damage. Excellent! Good for the Wizards. They need that power. By no means is anyone asking Lifetaps to be unresistable on every mob in the game for all levels. Having them land within the allowable level range is not too much to ask. As it stands now, in the high end game, lifetaps are either flagged off limits on certian mobs, or the magic resistance of said mobs is too high. <P>I dont know where youre getting your information from, but you are obviously not getting it from the Necro threads. Either that or you are simply trolling because you lack the skills to find something better to do with your time. I suggest you look more closely at the threads before you run in and vomit out your misinformations.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>To Absor, <P>Leave DDs to Wizy, that's all we got and please don't shorten the lifetaps cast times and please don't make them unresistable as some want. Maybe just put a cap on them. And by the way, the skele form that necros get cating ignite bones looks pretty look. Maybe you can leave that in.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Ok, I just wanted to post one of the posts on the caster thread about what is currenly happening with necros.  <P>One more thing, this really isnt an argument I want to get ivolved in, but plutomoon, you really should read through the thread before you yell at us for wanting things that noone here ever said they wanted, we dont want DD upgrades, and I dont see why anyone but another caster would want the illusion on Ignite/Chill bones. BTW, there is already a cap on lifetaps, but nothing seems to be happening with it... <P><BR>Necromancers:<P><BR>ITEM: Ignite Bones.<P>DESCRIPTION: Despite the coolness factor, this spell can't really be used on the big raids because it suddenly pulls the enemy out of range, and by the time you relocate your range, one warrior could conceivably do more damage than the spell is going to do. The best solution is to make the skeleton match the target in body type and size. If the skeleton can’t be sized, then perhaps remove it and find some other cool way to make sure that the spell 'sticks' to the target to prevent chain casting and to make it more than just another DD. Or, give it a longer recast time instead of the ‘sticky’ thing. This would give value to multiple necromancers in a group.<P>STATUS: None<P>NOTE: Any change to this spell should also be made to Chill Bones (55).<P>---<P>ITEM: Lifetaps.<P>DESCRIPTION: The number one request is to allow Lifetaps to land on the big monsters. A necromancer uses these spells, at least in part, to fuel there mana transfer spells. Allowing them to land on the big encounters would make them much more useful for doing damage and for transferring mana, and would help them feel more useful in the final encounters on raids.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: DoTs and corpse poofing.<P>DESCRIPTION: This affects everyone. Hopefully this is now much improved, but I’m not taking it off the list until I’m convinced.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Mana transfer.<P>DESCRIPTION: If the Lich series bug is fixed, then perhaps a 2:1 transfer rate might be a fair change. Reducing the effectiveness of the hit point regeneration for necromancers will also lower their ability to transfer mana. Necromancers would like to see this ratio raised in any case.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Infusion.<P>DESCRIPTION: Make infusion targetable. The necro might still see it as a 'worthless spell', but if another caster wants to sacrifice their experience for 1000 mana, then might actually cast this spell. Otherwise, those Essence Emerald’s will only be used for raising the dead.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Defoliation.<P>DESCRIPTION: There seem to be plenty of plants that this just doesn't work on. Certainly this spell needs to be limited in its use because it is overly efficient against one monster type. But it might be worthwhile to evaluate the things that are not considered plants that maybe should be.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Track Corpse.<P>DESCRIPTION: Broken spell. Is it going to stay that way?<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Lich Series.<P>This series of spells is broken. It is more powerful than it should be. It takes the necromancer's hit points and turns them into mana. It was calculated at a certain ratio to be 'in balance'. Unfortunately, these spells were adversely affected by the reduction of damage to spells used by players on players. This also reduced the hit points taken from the necromancer by Lich spells, so that the ratio of mana gained for hit points lost is nearly 1 for 1 (instead of about 3 for 2). This is a bug that was left alone because it would be a 'nerf'. In conjunction with a serious look at the entire class and the balance of all the classes, this series needs to be looked into and a decision should be made.<P>Other ideas for this line would be to allow it more stacking (with Clarity and Heal over Time spells).<P>There is also some question as to why there are two Lich spells at level 60.<P>STATUS: None<P>NOTE: Series includes: Arch Lich (60), Demi Lich (60), Lich (49), Call of Bones (34), Allure of Death (20).<P>---<P>ITEM: Trucidation.<P>DESCRIPTION: This is the 1100 point life tap that requires an essence emerald and has a 10 minute recast. The next weakest lifetap does about 750 points. The suggestion here is that this spell be unresistable and do more damage. The high cost of the reagent and the long recast time, are very limiting factors for the spell, even if it were unresistable. It also might allow the necromancer a lot more leeway against the big opponents, doing some damage and also restocking their hit points for more mana distribution.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Pets and Fear Immunity.<P>DESCRIPTION: It makes some sense that undead pets would be immune to fear. Again, this would help the necromancer do more at the end of a raid. Perhaps only the highest level undead pets would be immune to fear.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Stacking Bug with Splurt.<P>DESCRIPTION: Heart Flutter, Asystole, or Cessation will stick if Splurt is cast first, but Splurt will not take hold if they are cast first. Seems like a bug.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Summon Companion.<P>DESCRIPTION: Giving this to magicians requires consideration about giving it to necromancers (and all other pet classes).<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Screaming Terror.<P>DESCRIPTION: It seems that Screaming Terror is not overwritten by enchanter mesmerization spells. It also seems to work on NPCs that are unaffected by those same enchanter spells, making it a bit more powerful than enchanter mez. Also, it appears that it was intended to be a fear spell that also wiped the hate list, but it wasn't technically possible to make it work that way when the spell was first introduced. If this is so, perhaps now it is possible to make it (or some new spell) work that way.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Sedulous Subversion.<P>DESCRIPTION: The ratio of mana transferred with this spell seems to be worse than the previous spell in the line, Covetous Subversion. That seems like an error.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>STATUS: Coffin Availability.<P>DESCRIPTION: There appear to be no regular coffins available in Necromancer/Shadow Knight guilds other than Neriak. They should probably be available elsewhere<BR>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Spell Availability.<P>DESCRIPTION: It seems that there are no 49th level necromancer spells available on vendors in Paineel.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Shadowbound.<P>DESCRIPTION: The previous spell in this line stacks with regen buffs and Skin Like Nature, but Shadowbound does not. This seems like a bug.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Component Usage for Summon Corpse.<P>DESCRIPTION: It seems that if you duck during a casting of this spell you can prevent the component from being used for a failed casting, otherwise it is used up. If the component is supposed to be used on a failed casting, then it should be used up, regardless of the character's movements. If not (and this seems to be the proper course of action), then the component should be used only upon successful casting.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Spell Icons.<P>DESCRIPTION: Most of the icons for necromancer spells are the same black skull on a red background. It sure would be nice if there were some new icons to help distinguish one spell gem from another.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: 59th Level Pet.<P>DESCRIPTION: Many necromancers think that this pet is not much stronger (if at all) than the 56th level pet, and the cost of use is higher, so most just use the 56th level pet.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Dead Man Walking.<P>DESCRIPTION: Necromancers would like a spell that has all the benefits of Dead Man Floating except the floating part so that they can use it in places where levitation does not work.<BR>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Rare Spells.<P>DESCRIPTION: Chill Bones, Devouring Darkness, and Quivering Veil of Sarn seem to be very rare, perhaps too rare.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Cannibalize and Mod Rods.<P>DESCRIPTION: These two items should probably be checked to make certain that they are not also affected by the PvP damage reduction change.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Group Dead Man Floating.<P>DESCRIPTION: This is a spell that seems to be universally wanted by necromancers.<P>STATUS: N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item.<P>---<P>ITEM: Temporary Animation.<P>DESCRIPTION: A new spell idea.

</FONT><HR>For the love of God make our epic worth having, and fix the drop of the cloak.  The drop seems to be 30:1 rare drop.  That is rediculous, my guild has been to air many times and no cloak has ever dropped, for that matter the cloak on the server has never dropped.  It is a serious undertaking to do PoA and get to the KoS only to disappointed by an uber rare drop.  I know epic quest is suppose to be hard but give me a break.  First no one wants it cause it looks like a stoopid duck but the proc sucks and odds are KoS will never drop it.

</FONT><HR>Heh heh good advice Zirk, but when youre whole spell line up deals with dealing damage, you would expect to deal that damage. The way it is now, you throw a party and invite friends over and get stinking drunk if you can get a spell to even land. <P>Play stronger. Yes, we can adapt and overcome in real life, but in a game with such limitations depending on class set up, spell availabilty, and groups its kinda hard to just reroute everything. <P>Ok, lets say in real life, Im a Necromancer. Ive spent 29(almost 30..ugh) years of my life preparing and honing my skills in the dark arts. Bosses feared me because they knew I could disease or poison them into oblivion. I never had problems with traffic on the freeway because I just happily cursed everyone and blew up their cars on the way home. But lets say suddenly, everyhting I had worked so hard at just quit working like it used to. Bosses no longer fear me, and I get treated like garbage at work. Traffic is thicker than it ever used to be and alot of cars resist my spells. Now I have options. I could dive deep into research and create more devistatingly evil spells. I could create a whole new line of spells just for me, spells I knew wouldnt be resisted. Or, I could stop studying the black arts and turn to something else. Ive already got the experience of research and spell casting, so all it would take is some minor adjustments in the incantations and chants. I could give up magic completely, work out and train in weapon skilsl and martial arts and become a fighter. The choices are limitless in real life.<P>But in EQ. Youre a necro for life, you only have limited choices for spells, and if those spells dont work, youre shi...poop outta luck. sure, I could quit and start another class. But you have to start from ground zero and work back up. You cant just switch careers in mid swing. So what do you suggest? Play harder? How? Run faster? Cast faster? Med with more zeal? I dont understand.<P>We only have what Verant gave us...and sorry to say it aint making the cut anymore.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Pluto: <P>I want to say two things to your post.  The first is that I agree with you that DD's aren't the domain of a necro.  I don't want new DD's, because as you said I am not a wizard, and any necros who say they want DD's should really look into the reason they chose the class in the first place.<P>The second thing.  Unresitable lifetaps overpowered? What about melees.  Those have been unresistable since the beginning of time, and have only become so much more powerful nowadays.  When a melee can dish out in one round more than I can by casting THROUGH MANA lifetaps, then you can't justifiably say that unresistable lifetaps are going to overpower necros.  The one reason 6 necros could take out a SG is because of their pets, which at that point in their life is about as powerful as a secondary warrior.  Give necros unresistable lifetap and send 30 of'em against Trakanon.  They'll still all die.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I dont see why ignite would be a big issue.  500 dmg is done by 1 rogue backstabbing.  I wouldnt bother trying to work a fix for something with like that.  Necro epic....enough said.  If anything dont nerf us anymore please.  Its hard to find a group and taking away any of our solo abilities is just a kick in the pants.  Im a 58 necro and once stood for 3 hours looking for a group in sebilis.

</FONT><HR>I've made several posts to this discussion before but it seems like we are mostly being ignored.  However I would like to address one other issue which I have just thought of - namely the perception of necro power.<P>Once upon a time necros were the most powerful class - certainly pre-Kunark.  Now however we have received many nerfs reducing our power.  I think we did need to be nerfed somewhat from our previous level of power but now I think we are underpowered.  However Verant still seems to have the impression that we are still the best class in the game.<P>Now where does this perception come from?  I think that it comes from (and I'm afraid to say it) the majority of the other classes who remember seeing necros sometime ago soloing mobs which they could only dream of doing.  Either this, or they remember a level 10 necro soloing with ease (I give you the fact that necros are very good soloers to about level 25).  Since then we've been nerfed and we have a much harder time soloing - in fact I've more or less given up on soloing.  These other classes who think we have it easy can most likely get into a group with just about no problems and with the recent exp bonus (very good idea BTW) for grouping can now make more experience than a necro soloing.  Necros however are never in demand for groups and are generally only taken if there is noone else available and the group needs one more.<P>As a result of this other classes can in fact now gain experience more quickly than a necro soloing.  Now if we are meant to be able to solo then surely we should have the power to gain experience at the same rate as if we were in a group.  If we were in fact meant to be groupable then we should get some group friendly spells which fit in with our class definition (i.e. not mana pump).<P>So other classes please remember that soloing for a necro is a lot harder than it used to be and comfort yourselves knowing that you are gaining exp a lot quicker than necros are.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here is something that I have been thinking about for a while, and have decided to put it up.  This is not intending to make/start a flame war it's just my opinion.<P><BR>I disagree in making Necromancers more effective in raids.  To help explain i'll Compare a Warrior (since i play a warrior) and a Necromancer.<P>A Warrior after about level 20~22 loses his effectiveness to solo, and must search out a group to get more experience.  Without help he cannot gain levels and get to go on these raids.  At a raid warriors Shine out a lot because they are able to deal some damage and take a lot of hits from the mob.<P>A Necromancer hardly ever loses his effectiveness to solo, as it is done all the time.  They are almost 2 classes, because they have a pet that can deal insane Damage to the mob, and they cast very powerful Dots.  They don't really shine on raids because they can't use pets to help kill.<P>Now think of that.  I see raids as a gift of toughing the time out to level up.  As a Warrior i've hardly ever seen a necro in the group, unless there were many spawns and he didn't have any chance to solo. In raids we have a good job, but it can take a while to get there, as we don't have a shot at soloing Giants.  Necromancers do it all the time.

</FONT><HR>Ok lets take a step back for a second.<BR>ABSOR is interested in making us useful to a raid.<BR>Lets stick to that.<P>To become useful to raids we need to benefit other classes so that we are necessary in someway.<BR>Verant employees, I believe a spell called "Troubling Distraction," which can prevent a Boss mob from summoning for 10 to 15 seconds would be an EXCELLENT role for us on raids.  A necromancer could then be viewed as a fearful class in the respects of the boss mob (most importantly this is roleplayable too).   <P>This spell would be benifial to Wizards and other casters.  I have read the wizard threads.  Removing the threat of summoning even the slightest bit puts others casters at easy to nuke away.  <P>"Troubling Distraction," the spell; if created, could even be resisted some times or have a long casting time, not always ensuring the uber mob will stop summoning.  Remember, it is the somewhat relief that makes the difference.<P>If that is not enough plz do fix the mana giving ratio spells.  In the process you may nerf lich this is understandable.  If that angers the crowds of necros lighten the blow by moving one of the two Demi or Arch lich spells down in lvl (suggestion: 55th).. no reason to have two of the same type of spells at 60th.<P>Last solution would be to leave necros as they are because as you said Absor we are a bit balanced as it is.<P>(sorry fellow necros but many of us are getting rapped up with lower lvl fears... lich is not all that.)<P>Small Person wish:  remove ignite bones illusion from the spell.<P>-57th necro of The Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>     I understand your point, Amiemadrox.  Classes that can't solo very far SHOULD be rewarded by being NEEDED in groups, and even more importantly in high level raids.  And see, that's the point, your class IS needed.  I think I can safely speak for (the majority of) Necros when I say we aren't asking to be needed in raids.  But what we do want is to be USEFUL in raids.  Notice the destinction there?<P>     Let me elaborate a little.  Many classes in this game can solo.  Druids, Shamen, Magicians, Wizards, ect., and of course, Necros.  In fact, some of those classes can solo better than we can.  Despite this, they should bring something useful to a raid.  With the upgrades to their healing abilities, Shamen and Druids will have a use on raids, Magician's pets will soon be useful on raids, and we all know what a Wizard's job is.  So why then, should Necromancers be nearly useless on raids?  Because we can solo up to 55?  So can these other classes and they can still do what they were always designed to do from level 1.  So why does a Necromancer's role change post 50?  And worse still, the role we were given we are very poor at.  THIS is what Necros are upset about.<P>     Imagine if you will, that you picked Warrior as you class before the release of Kunark (and maybe you did), and leveled up to 50.  Then with Kunark came more levels, and you found out your job NOW was to buff people, and you could no longer tank.  How would you feel?  Well this is exactly what has happened to Necros.  I've been playing since beta, and prior to the release of Kunark I had a pretty good idea what being a Necro was.  I was confortable with my role in this game, and worked my way up to 50 knowing what my job was.  Then Kunark came out, and my job changed, and I am upset, and I believe I have a right to be upset.<P>     I hope I have enlightened you a little in a non-flame way.  I want you to understand our plight.  Keep in mind whatever your feelings about a particular class, the fact is this is a game of cooperation, not competition.  We are all in this together and I would never wish ill will upon any of my friends who play the other classes.  We are all in this together.  Good luck to you Amiemadrox, and keep on tankin.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Due to a high level of frustration from the (lack of) results from the last necro thread, I have refrained from really reading this one or voicing my opinion. However, nothing ventured, nothing gained. <P>I did not create a necromancer to become a corpse summoning manastone. I created a necromancer to be a damage dealing master of the undead. Here's what I'd like to see that would resolve my complaints with the end-game for necromancers:<P>Is there any reason why the level 59 necromancer pet can't be what the level 49 pet was when the game was originally released? Sure, at level 50 in EQ Proper zones, the original 49 pet was overpowered. But the Kunark and Velious mobs are a LOT tougher than their original counterparts. I don't understand why it would be overpowering for the pet to hit in the 70's when we're fighting mobs with 250,000+ hitpoints. Also, the pet requires a peridot to cast, so it should be a LOT better than the level 49 one and right now it isn't. Even with this adjustment, a well equipped warrior or rogue will still outdamage it. This would make the 59 pet a joy to watch in action. Every necromancer with it would be the envy of those without it. Not only would it look like a death dealing machine, it WOULD be a death dealing machine. Add to it either an innate ability or a buff to make the pet resistant to fear, and the pet even becomes useful on dragon raids. I'm not asking for the pet to be IMMUNE to poison, fire, cold, or even immune to fear. I'm just asking for the pet to do something other than run from the mob I'm fighting. <P>Make lifetaps (nearly) unresistable the same way they were intended to be at the release of the game. However, keep the level cap so that a necromancer can't drain a mob which is more than 5 levels higher than they are. A level 59 necro wouldn't be able to drain a level 65 mob, but a level 60 necromancer would be able to. This would encourage every necromancer to reach level 60, and at the same time solve the complaint that necromancers can no longer do damage on raids.  (If I am mistaken about the highest level mob being 65, adjust the level range accordingly.)<P>These two modifications would "Fix" the necromancer class in my eyes. I would have a reason to put myself through the "hell levels" to become a Warlock. I would be able to do on raids what I created a necromancer to do in the first place. I would no longer be just a corpse summoning manastone. I would once again be a damage dealing Master of the Undead. <P>The following is just things that I think would be nice:<P>Quit having pets take half of the necromancer's experience. (This goes for any pet class.) It's a spell, it's a weapon we use. A wizard doesn't have to split his experience with his ice comet. A warrior doesn't have to split her experience with her Ykesha. Why do pet casters have to split their experience with their pet?<P>Make Vampiric Embrace castable on others. Or, give us an upgrade post 50 which can be cast on others. It's a great spell, if you're a meleer. (And give SK's a non-nerfed version of all our spells. They're necro-warriors after all.) <P>A version of lich castable on others. Even if you had to make it a nerfed health to mana ratio, this would prohibit clerics from obtaining free infinite mana yet give improved mana regen when no clerics or bards were around.<P>General game enhancements:<BR>Can necromancer (and all characters for that matter) get more hitpoints? At level 58, I had 831 hitpoints if I was unbuffed & nekkid. With cleric buffs and equipment, I've had up to 2500 hitpoints. But the mobs I'm fighting can hit for 500 points PER HIT. Even greens hit me for 140+ points a shot PER HIT. If I'm just fighting one mob, I'm being hit for 280 to 1000 points per round. I just don't see how it is unbalancing to be able to last more than 3 rounds without having clerics chain casting on you. Every character class needs to have their natural hitpoints at least doubled.<P>In every other RPG game I've ever experienced, the melee characters tank mobs while the casters stand back and zap. The casters do more damage, offset by the fact that they can't take a beating like the tanks do. But in EQ, if a caster isn't in melee range of a mob, the majority of the spells are resisted. Spells need to be able to hit for full damage from the edge of their spell casting range. <P>Tanks need to be able to BLOCK a mob. If I'm in a dungeon, an ogre can block me from running down the hallway. The mob can just pass right through him. You told us that mobs have more power to compensate for the fact that your AI can't compete with the human brain. But any time that we use our brain to outthink the mob, it's considered an exploit. (Use an AE to kill a mob trapped behind a locked door? Exploit.) If we're not allowed to use our advantage, then why are the mobs allowed to use theirs? Let our tanks block the mobs and our casters hit them from behind the tanks.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>                          *A lengthy plea to the gods of Norrath*<P>                          My suggestion is that you make the pets resistant to fear, because undead fear nothing; resistant to disease,<BR>                          because undead are supposed to use disease as a weapon, not be plagued by it (no pun intended); resistant to<BR>                          poison, because they have no blood or nervous system to attack.<P>                          I know this is a fantasy world, and "realistic" is a term commonly thrown around, but - while we can throw out<BR>                          realism and suspend disbelief in a fantasy setting - inductive reasoning and logical associations should hold true. <P>                          As for the other points, here is what the necromancer really wants (in order of importance):<P>                          1) Lifetaps/lifetap dot's that work at least 51% of the time on major enemies. This is our bread and butter line of<BR>                          spells. If one spell line defines the necromancer, this is it. Pets are great to have, but we'd be a mage if we wanted<BR>                          powerful pets. God knows verant nerfed ours to near uselessnes.<P>                          2) One "get out of nerf free" card, whereby the necromancer class can play this card at their leisure, when they<BR>                          feel they are going to be nerfed unfairly (again). Ok, maybe this is just a fun one. =)<P>                          The real #2) Risk/Reward re-evaluation. Pet improvements and/or dot improvements to bring our damage output<BR>                          inline with the other classes in the game would help. Necromancers can outdamage bards. That's about it. We are<BR>                          pure casters - pure casters devoted to EVIL! We want to kill. At this time, druids, clerics (/boggle), shaman, and<BR>                          every other unlikely class can humiliate us when competing for damage. We do negligible damage in battles with<BR>                          mobs over level 55. Our pets cause more trouble than they are worth in the planes. We cannot safely visit more<BR>                          than three cities and an outpost without struggling for days with newbie quests, only to be beaten down by some<BR>                          unrelated faction within a city. The risk/reward for necros is nowhere near balanced. The necromancer class is the<BR>                          most persecuted. Shouldn't there be a reward for all of our troubles?<P>                          3) If not #1 or #2, then at least a different role than mana battery. There are two lines of spells most<BR>                          necromancers would prefer replaced by two new lines. That being the mana transfer spells and the essence<BR>                          emerald spells. Mana transfer spells are a waste! Why convert my mana to a person with a role, when I should<BR>                          have a role myself? This is just plain humiliating to necromancers who have struggled through 50+ levels of<BR>                          prejudice and hatred to end up dumping their hard-earned mana to the high elf wizard so he can get off another<BR>                          nuke, or the dwarven cleric so he can heal someone. Humiliating! We want a job after level 50. Give us something<BR>                          we can do besides tailoring backpacks.<P>                          Essence emeralds are too costly. Plain and simple. It's nice to have powerful spells, but why bother memorizing<BR>                          them if their cost is unbalanced. Would anyone in their right mind sacrifice hours of their play time so someone can<BR>                          gain 1000 mana? NO! Make it targetable? Heh... why not just give it to all other classes but necromancer and make<BR>                          it free for them to cast. Who do you think will absorb the high pricetag on this spell? You guessed it - the person<BR>                          who casts the spell, not the one who receives the mana. But, again, this is another case of necromancer mana<BR>                          being useless, so we may as well give it away to someone with a role in the end game.<P>                          4) Group DMF. This should be in the game anyway. It has no balancing effect, as the group wouldn't be waiting on<BR>                          necromancer mana anyway. Mana checks are for clerics, enchanters, and anyone else who has a role in the end<BR>                          game.<P>                          5) Make plants plants. Yes, a druid had a great point that humans are, indeed, animals, so they should be able to<BR>                          charm them, but this would be unbalancing. Plants in PoG would not! Necromancers don't do all that much in PoG or<BR>                          any decent high level zone, for that matter. If we cannot kill plants with defoliation, then turn it into a disease<BR>                          based dd that works on any type of mob. The damage/mana ratio is not any better than that of any other classes<BR>                          ratios.<P>                          6) Stop calling us overbalanced and get someone to play a level 51+ necromancer for a couple of months. With all<BR>                          the resources you have available to you, one would think you could pay someone to play a necromancer. God<BR>                          knows it might come to that if we are nerfed any further.<P>                          7) When you're holding an apple in one hand, please discard the butcher's knife in the other. Not only have<BR>                          necromancers received the most nerfs since beta, we have also been cheated out of precious skills by giving us<BR>                          flashy utility spells that none of us use after a week. Examples: voice graft, deadeye, track corpse (that just<BR>                          started working, 6 months after implementation, but is too annoying for anyone to want to use), chill bones (which<BR>                          has yet to drop on my server).<P>                          8) Make necromancers groupable with other necromancers. One necromancer per raid is all that anyone wants<BR>                          since you cripple our class with unstackable spells that aren't even that powerful to begin with. Ignite bones would<BR>                          be *decent* if more than one necro could cast. DOT's would be ok if they worked on big mobs, stacked, and didn't<BR>                          poof corpses (which still happens). Our healing spells (which have HORRIBLE ratios, by the way) would be nice if<BR>                          they didn't take so much of our life, stacked with people's buffs, and stacked with other necromancer's spells. <P>                          Plus, not only do our dot's not stack with our dot's, but many of our dot's are not compatible with ANY enchanter<BR>                          dot whether it is of a related sphere of magic or not. Shaman get half of the same dot's as we, and they get them<BR>                          sooner. Guess what? They don't stack either.<P>                          I realize that necromancers aren't meant to be the most "group-friendly" class in the game, but give us a role,<BR>                          PLEASE! Let us be wanted in a group BEFORE the cr begins. Let two of us group together and not have to waste<BR>                          half of our time coordinating what we're casting and when.<P>                          I may have messed up the order a touch, but you can tell which of these is important to our class, and which<BR>                          would just be nice to have. I suppose I should have said first, and foremost, we want to be needed again. I recall<BR>                          being a level 50 necromancer (a couple months into final), entering lower guk and getting /tell flooded from people<BR>                          wanting me in their group. Now, nearly level 60, I enter sebilis - the kunark equivilant of LGuk - and beg for hours<BR>                          before I can find a group if my guild has no openings in their camps. Any other class can enter that zone and be<BR>                          immediately snatched up. Let me repeat that last statement; ANY other class can enter sebilis and IMMEDIATELY<BR>                          find a group.<P>                          That is a slap in the face to those of us who worked so hard and spent so much time, effort, and hard-earned<BR>                          money, only to have our frayed ends of sanity snap back in our faces as we realize how much of our lives we've<BR>                          wasted to become useless. If I wanted to be useless, I would never have taken the time to level up; I would have<BR>                          just sat around and roleplayed and done newbie quests. <P><BR>                          I ramble. Hopefully you will find one bit of usefull information in my post, Absor. If so, please take it to heart when I<BR>                          tell you that these issues are very important to us as well as you. You offer a product that should build in value<BR>                          and customer satisfaction as time progresses. At this point, you are losing many customers because you have<BR>                          pigeon-holed the requests of 9% of your customer base (9% is close to, if not exactly, the amount of necromancer<BR>                          main characters in the game). We built up our characters only to see their relative power diminish. What is the<BR>                          point?<P><BR>                          Please, just give us a role.

Gee, it'd be nice to be able to quad my weakass necro to 60 on raptors...<BR>Or how about the Ench/Wiz nuke fest, where the Ench AOE Stuns and the Wizzy AOE nukes.. whereby they kill like 10 mobs at onces????<P>Hmmmm.... Mr. Plutomoon... i know it may be a little past your bedtime.<BR>How about you **** and go away, you are nothing but a lame troll who is obviously begging for a serious lack of attention.<BR>Several people here have been very nice in trying to tell you to utilize your own class thread to voice your class insecurities.  Now I am requesting that you BLOW, DORK.<P>Monitor Request:  Pls, delete Plutomoon's comments to this thead because they obviously hold no merrit here and only serve as trolls for attention.  WE do not need idiots like this posting pure ignorance, especially when we are trying so hare to remain united in having our wishes heard regarding the outcome of our class.<P>For many here, the outcome of such requests are the balance of our continued participation in this online game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I got a good idea...get rid of necromancer class all together...I am sick of feeding mana to clerics and druids...a necro is pretty much useless on a raid...leader of the raid says feed XXX mana and you see the necros feeding mana to the person.  Hmm I didn't know when I signed up to be a necro I was in it for sitting here with a thumb up my butt for hours just to feed mana. Either you make us group friendly or just get rid of the class all together.  It's true prekunark necros were unstoppable, but now our primary role in a raid is to feed mana to the cleric.  *shrug* not like you are going to do much I don't think.  I would like to see what you plan to do with necros.  Better do it fast too cause when Anarchy Online comes out and you haven't done squat you'll say bye to quite a few people<P>Gillberg </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>/agree Gillberg<P>If the mana dumping is needed give it to shamans that are better equipped to do it with regen line and cannibalize and then just get rid of the necro all together as this is a grouping game and necros have no place in the game at least not post 50.<P>retired 51 necro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
