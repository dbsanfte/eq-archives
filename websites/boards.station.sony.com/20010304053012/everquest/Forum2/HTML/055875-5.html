</FONT><HR>I really like the above idea of the "holy cause".<P>A devout warrior - not quite as strong as the warriors by his side, not as powerful in the arcare arts as the caster, not as good a healer as his (or her) trainers ther clerics. But supassing all in this only<P>Their courage determination and devotion.<P>This spurs those around him to better themselves in what they excel at so they can in their way be as determined as the paladin (ok ok so i want to build in a forced envy type thing but get that out the way let the paladins help the rest with something other than our LoH)<P>Ok i have waffelled on enough with a little story behind NormandyEQ's excellent suggestion<P>As for a little suggestion of my own with the above RP type scene in mind how to implement that kind of buff<P>1. Make it similar in effect to a bard song - ie it affects the group but only when near the paladin.<P>2. I have now idea how bards work re songs (do they have mana - i dont know) but since this is a paladin as this is used let his mana drop x amount per tick.<P>3. Fighters go better with more haste - so give this spell some hast effect (the paladin has spurned them to fight quicker)<P>4. Casters fight better with more mana and quicker regen - so give the casters that bit extra mana and more regen per tick (the pressence of the paladin makes them think harder and quicker)<P>5. Everyone stays in the fight longer if they shrug of more wounds, take less damage and rejouvinate a bit faster - so give this buff some AC hp and regen qualities.<P>6. Make this buff stack with EVERYTHING<P>ok so the above buff could be made totally power stupid and unbalance the entire system. I am not asking for that. Make each effect small (someone spurring you on to bigger and better things is hardly going to affect you massively) but all these things each giving say an extra say 5-30% over what buffs is already on them and is useful to the entire group near the paladin would make us worth having.<P>As a couple of foot notes to this several versions of this spell could be spread through the game giving a greater and greater rise as it progresses - what level to start it from i dont know - maybe 50, maybe 9.<P>The maximum effect of the spell increases with level to a fixed maximum - in the same way DD spells do more damage to a point then you upgrade spells.<P>This fits with the paladins roll as a defender and a holy warrior. It complements the paladins abilities and those of his companions without all inline keeping the balance - the warriors still deal more damage and the casters are still better at what they do. They just all do it that little bit better than they did before.<P>Just to reitterate the main things that would make this a useful addition - MAKE IT STACK WITH EVERYTHING ELSE GOING. make it mana intensive on the paladin so he cant keep it up for too long a couple of minutes or so and then a while to recharge. And as a ast quick point since it is the charisma of the paladin that is effecting the group - linking the spells performance to the charactors charisma would also be logical (i never said a good or bad idea thats for other people to think about)<P>Berevon 28th Paladin of Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You said it Pal.<P>I've said what the pally class needs to be improved up to what would make us balanced with the other classes but as you said everyone is getting their hopes up.  The enhancements the pally class needs are the enhancements verant has specifically said we would NOT get as it would make us a contender to other classes (god forbid another class would have to compete with pallys and lose their monopoly on being a tank).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This doesn't have anything to do with suggestions for balancing the pally class cause I'm all out of those after 6 or 7 posts.  I just hope that whatever enhancements go live from all the balancing discussions I hope that verant blows my mind.  I don't have any hope of gaining any really needed or even useful skills/abilities/spells out of this simply because of what verant's opinion of a pally is and what a hybrid is.  <P>I know that from when I was just about to hit level 50 months before kunark ever came live there where paladins all over the place.  Every fear raid I went on there was at least 6 pallys there compared to only about 2 warriors 2 rangers and 1 shadowknight.  Yes that's right, the total number of paladins on most raids (even plane of hate raids) were greater than the total number of warriors rangers and shadowknights combined.  Now when I go on a raid I am either the only pally there or there or on occasion there is 1 other.  Very seldom there are 3 of us but that is only because another player sometimes gets his pally twink that has a FD but otherwise it's mostly just me.  <P>The paladin population on my server has gone from around 30+ pallys that were maxed at level 50 when kunark came out to just 11 of us who are now level 60.  Thing is that only 3 of us are original pallys from the old days and the rest were still youngins when kunark came live.<P>If pallys don't get balanced out and become useful in the game again there is only going to be a handful of devout pallys left on each server.  Those pallys will prolly not be invited to raids and will revert to defending newbies, but then again maybe that's what verant wants afterall pallys are a defensive class (sarcasm).<P>I made a paladin as my 1st character because I loved what they are, since then I've seen more nerfs than improvements for my class and watched as other classes get nerfed once or so then get huge improvements and pallys are left behind.<P>You (verant) are doing what you think is right by allowing the players of each class be a factor in these balancing issues and for that I give you props.  However, until you get in our shoes and run around the track field you are not going to be able to help us the way we need to be helped.  There are going to be enhancements brought up that are going to make seperate classes furious (all classes not just against pallys, funny how everyone can crack down on whiners but then they do the same thing when their class comes into the picture).  Unfortunately for us you have listened to their complaints and it has hurt the pally class in the long run (just look at where we are now, you can't deny it).  <P>Most of the posts I see are from pallys that are level 57 or lower and there's nothing wrong with that.  The problem is most of the veteran pallys have either retired or don't care to post and get false hopes of revival.  That creates an even bigger problem because the majority of the balancing needs to be made at the higher levels.  I'm not saying there's nothing wrong with the pally class at lvl 57 or under I'm merely saying the thoughts need to be visionarey so that it improves the class even more at higher levels.<P>Please don't blow the pally class off again.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree with alot of the post here about changes that pallys need. I think the ones you've made on test are a improvment, and a step in the right direction, but that's not enough, especially for the higher lvl pallys. Although only a lvl 40 paladin myself right now, I've read many posts and sites about paladin flaws and needs, and have lvl 60 paladin friends on my server, who agree that there are many changes that pallys need. Alot of these suggestions are hard to tell if they're something a paladin needs and is a major balance issue, or they're just things that paladin's want or would like to see changed about the class. I won't pretend to know which is which, but I do know that paladin's DO have balance issues, some major ones in fact, and changes are going to have to be made for there to be even a slight improvment on pally class balance. I hope verant seriously considers these changes, and pays attention to the posts in this and the first thread, because these people play paladins, know paladins, and understand where they are lacking and what they need. You gotta understand that the major of paladin players are those that like the concept, the idea of the paladin, a holy knight, defender of justice, righter of wrongs, one who would always be willing to help. These are the ideas I enjoyed and wanted to RP in the everquest setting, which is why my first class, as well as my favorite class, will always be my paladin. I will get him to 60, or 70, or whatever the lvl cap is by then one day, and I will always continue to play him no matter how much verant might nerf or ruin the class. The day I stop playing my paladin is the day I'll quit everquest, so please verant, give me and all the other paladin players out there a reason to stay and to be a Paladin.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>For me paladin is ideally my favorite class, but also the second most disappointig one ( behind bard)in the game. Paladins need better offense (and weapon skill) before all else. Raising the caps here to 230 is a must. It is embarrassing how little damage you can do as a pally once you get to the mid-game. <P>I would strongly recommend extending crits to one-hand slashing for pallies. There is little else to make up for the lack of dual wield. They don't have to cap as high as warriors here, but the crits need to be there.<P>Maybe a little off the track, but I want to say that I believe that the Wurmslayer should be paladin and SK ONLY !! I am tired seeing it in the hands of dual-wielding warriors and rangers. It totally removes the 2H slash option as viable in the latter classes. Just imagine what it does to pallies and SKs who can't even dual-wield!<P>Back on track, the defense correction is already being tested on Test, and I approve whole-heartedly. We need the taunt cap raised to accompany this as well though. How are we supposed to stay on top of the ag list in a group with dual-wielders and blasters without it?<P>The spell line is barely passable but acceptable if the above offensive changes are implemented. The spell line, even including Lay Hands, does not make up for the weakness in combat. Unless some of the cleric line direct damage is made available ( which I don't believe will even be considered), it will be the combat improvements which will make or break the effort to balance this class. Thanks for listening! </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One thing that a lot of you have been asking for, is enhancements in 1H and shield combination.  I understand the RP part of this, and that a lot of paladins choose this as their form of fighting...<P>But....<P>I just got a Axe for my dwarf paladin, it is very nice Axe (EVBA) and 2HS.  I think dwarfs, in RP terms, are (and look) much better with an Axe than with a sword.  So while most are RPing a human paladin, where a shield and sword is the mainstay in RP, lets not forget that some of us are dwarfs and like the aspect of using powerful Axes.  It's a non-traditional form of a paladin being a dwarf, and using an Axe, but I think its good to have variety.  Not to mention there are some decent 2HS out there to use.<P>Any special enhancements for only 1H and shield would push me away from playing my Paladin like I would like too (we need enhancements that bad).  <P>Ruadin<BR>Cavalier on my way to Knighthood</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Keep Pally/SK offensive ability lower than warriors to balance for added defense.<P>2 - Add/modify AC/HP buff spells that will make them "the best" tanks in the game to make up for pitiful offensive abilities.<P>3 - Make Taunt MUCH more effective than it currently is when used by pallys.<P>4 - Give the pallys/SKs the absolute best armor/shields in the game.

</FONT><HR>Well Absor,<P>Just thought I'd give you a little 'preliminary' feedback on your proposals, according to what you've posted already. Personally, I figure your throwing us a bone, but you won't fix the class.<P>Let me define how I consider us broken. I love my paladin, and want to play the character. I have played the character since day 1 and have tons of days played on file. But I am done with him now. I just can't be anything but an drag on my raiding friends with the power you've 'allowed' my character. I assume this exodus of certain classes is what prompted Verant to initiate these 'class' balances in the first place. Well, nothing you've said you are willing to offer is sufficient to have keep me from following this path at this time.<P>If I may be so radical, I'd suggest that you'd be better off fixing paladins by reinstituting the exp penalty (not like you it does most of us present high level's much good now anyhow) and actually MAKE Paladins genuinely better characters then warriors. You don't even have to give us equal skills to do this. Just ADEQUATE skills. At least this way people would have to pay with their time to acquire one of the best classes. This was the reasoning behind the experience penalty to begin with. Something that continued to exist after you buffed warriors WAY out of reach of a competing paladin early on in the game. But at the high level game, players want to be the best they can be AND participate and contribute in that game.<P>The high end game is raiding and I do not even see ONE thing you will provide Paladins that is worthwhile to continue the class. Nothing, nada zilch. I don't mean we have NO contribution. Just no contribution worth playing a paladin for. The Paladin, a sub-standard tank is what you offer. Why bother I ask? I realize it's better then what we ARE, but do you REALLY think that's good enough? Paladins will still be inferior in defense, offense and damage to warriors, rogues and monks. Monks wear NOTHING for pete's sake. /sigh You corrected paladin is a paladin whose spells will STILL be all overwritten. Has no contribution that exceeds the advantages of playing one of the other 'main' classes.. ie. Warrior, Cleric, Rogue. Stuns 'maybe' you say, but that's going to be for all classes. Thus.. warriors can bash, kick and perform the task as well as I along with the other stunning classes cleric, enchanter. Well, there I go starting a line item point-by-point and I am NOT going to do that. That's been done to death here and I certainly don't need to waste mine or your time on it.<P>There have been quite a few offerings here of suggestions to give paladins some real power in the high end game. Something unique but that is a CONTRIBUTION to the raiding game. Every time you've said too strong or unbalancing.<P> I have the abilities to be the best I can be, and I shall be. Sooo.. seems you've made up my mind for me. It's alot easier to level a warrior. They get most everything, have all the advantages, are easier to play, easier to level and have a real sound contribution in the high end raiding game. A genuine cornerstone to the game if you will. They are required, without them there is no raid. They have alot to be proud of. Something I tried to be with my paladin, but alas poor Yorrick. Or maybe I'll go do a rogue.. who does more damage in 6 seconds then a paladin in 6 minutes at the high end game. Or maybe a monk.. who can do damage AND still tank better then I can. Must be the silk.. lol. Or a cleric, then I'll actually have heals AND buffs AND a higher AC. Check out the AC thing if you doubt me. Or even a druid, they have alot more contribution then I do and I know several who have the same ac I do. Must be the 'thick leather' armor. LOL<P><BR>But hey, good try though Absor.. I still appreciate the time you've spent here, even if you don't get it in my opinion.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I know you don't like the fact that things are broken right now (because they really are, I KNOW this), but the only way to stress that point and get anywhere is to post detailed and logical posts with lots of information.  There is a lot of that already on this board, but the only way we can stress this enough is to give him more and more to look into.  Its the informative posts which he is looking for, if he has to filter out flames or non-productive dialog it hinders his ability to find the good information and actually work/focus on it.<P>If they don't fix things....well I don't know what to say other than we can live our wishes to be a paladin elsewhere in another fantasy game.

</FONT><HR>I had this idea for a level 39 spell that would help out groups and make the game more interesting. Everyone know that the best reason to have a paladin in a group is for his LoH ability but after he uses it then he is stuck being a tank and a poor healer. I had the idea for a spell that I call selfless act, what it would do is allow the paladin to take the damage of another player. I figured a good level to get this spell would be level 39 when things start to get a lot harder in the game. Mostly the spell would work like this, first you have to target a person (just like you would with LoH) then cast the spell (I was thinking of like a 1.5 sec casting time so you could cast it with in a turn of combat) After it was cast then the paladin would start taking all damage that the target player would recieve (I was thinking around 45 sec total time) I would give the healer of the group a chance to save the poor player and would make the paladin more desirable in a group. ( Also so people to abuse the ability make it with around a 10 min recast time) Not only do i think it will help balance the paladin class out a bit and make them more desirable but also it make sense if you think of it in roleplaying terms. Paladin are always willing to give there life up for someone else.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have yet to reach the high end game, however I would like to drop my 2 coppers worth right now.  <P>I dont believe that disciplines are the answer.<BR> <BR>/em quickly slips on his flame retardant suit.<P>The changes that are on test are a nice step in the right direction.  Their true impact is yet to be seen (I mean really, how many 50+ paladins play on test?)<P>When those changes go live we should see a positive step.  Another positive step would be to make us the same distance behind warriors in offence at 60 that we were at 50 (that only makes sense).  I believe the gap was MUCH closer then than it is now.  You stat crunchers probably can provide bar graphs demonstrating the difference.<P>After that, it's clear that warriors still have a VERY Definite advantage in the tanking arena (unless you ask them, some of them seem oblivious to their own tanking abilities and see everyone else as stepping on their toes).  <P>Ideas mentioned that I really like.<BR>Giving mele's block when equipping a shield - (yes warriors too).  This gives mele's a reason to equip a shield (not much of one for warriors/rangers because they wont want to give up their extra damage, but it will still be an option and will make shields more worthwhile).<P>Increasing Bash for sk/pal to that of a warrior.<BR>Right now, warriors dont bash (except for those with inherrant slam ability).  I don't think that this is stepping on anyone's toes here to request that pal/sk should be the kings of bashing with a shield.<P>Crit's versus Undead - I really like this as a paladin ability.  Make it come in about 20 or so (really, this should have been in all along).  Something comparable for the sk as well if you like, I dont know as much about their plight as I do the state of the paladin.<P>Ok, now marginally I also like the summon squire deal.  (make him next to nothing if you like, having a level 10 squire following you around is neat, useless but neat.  I dont think this is required, it just has a HIGH coolness factor).<P>Summon warhorse has already been discussed and I believe it is right out.  They would have to add to the global load for the horse, this they really need to use for more enchanter illusions before they give paladins a horse.  (no, I dont have a chanter).<P>Well, that's about it.  The only discipline I've heard of that I really like is stepping in to take the damage for someone (Save that cleric/enchanter so he can save the party, that sort of thing).  Make it so paladins can't attack while this is happening, make it supper agro and root the pal, something like that.  This is the ONLY discipline that I saw that I really thought would fit the paladin image and might be acceptable for Verrant.  If there are abuses, it could be toned down or something.  There are too many variables in the game to say it's as simple as pull monster and trade blows till it died.  Way too many.<P>Thanks for listening Absor.  I wish you luck in dealing with the hatred that seems to be sprayed on this board.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, here I sit back at 31, after soloing to 32 in this group oriented game with a sub-standard "balanced" Paladin.  Couldnt get a group after 29 because I had, as a Paladin, nothing to offer a group.  Buffs that can be overwritten by a lower level cleric, a "masters" attack skill that allows me an average 60% hit rate against a low blue or hi green with minimal damage given out and a loss of 50% health taken.  Heaven forbid I have 2 agrod on me and dont have LOH.  I die.  Of course, I hit 32 and virtually everything is green where I am, so, in search of a little more exp, I go to an area that has more blues - of a higher level.  So now I am 31 again.<P>Not a whine, just a fact.  Paladins are balanced, judging from Absors resonse to this thread, and will get little if any changes to make the Paladin a more viable character.<P>At least my pally is of sufficient level to twink the warrior I created and got to level 4 in an hour, since this is a game designed for the warrior class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I retired Nevik about 3 weeks ago. I had just achieved level 50, the goal I had set for myself months ago. I had promised myself that Nevik would get to 50 before I quit or retired. The guild I was in dismantled.  I tried to get in another guild and was rejected. Why, basically because Pallies are basically worthless to have in groups at higher levels. We do no worthwhile damage. No body really wants a Pally in there group if they can a monk, warrior or rogue. They will accept a Pally if they cant find a cleric or a druid. Or if there are not a warrior, monk, rogue or ranger around.  I have sat many hours in Karnors looking for a group. I just sit in the corner for a while. If I cant get a group after like 30 minutes I go play an alt. Other classes are picked up as soon as they say they are looking. They even will say looking for a tank. I volunteer and they say we already have a Paladin we need a tank, i.e. Warrior, monk or rogue.  And when they say tank, they really mean someone who can take damage and deliver damage.<P>It feels to me that during my whole career as a Paladin I have been an under achiever. Other classes are always better or preferred. The reasons for this have been said again and again throughout the Paladin community and are reiterated here in this thread. I am a Paladin in heart and I play all my characters in the spirit of a Paladin. I have hopes, that with the class changes, that maybe Nevik will be of use in the world of Norrath. But my fear and expectation is that Paladins will just get a band-aid and will have no real use in the world of Norrath. <P>I have a suggestion for you guys. Create a level 50 Paladin. Equip him/her with ac around 850 and a Mith 2Hander.  This is basically what I have, its very average equipment.  This is the type of equipment available to a regular Paladin. Now go play him/her for a month. Go to Karnors and try and get in a group.  Be sure to do it in the evening US time. And try different servers. Crowded ones and uncrowded ones. Let me know how you feel after you have done this for a month. Now realize, this is how Paladins have felt for the past 2 years. <P>An in-game friend of mine heard that Nevik was retiring and that I was unable to get into a guild. He quit his guild and started up guild of his own. So that I would have a guild to join. I want to publicly thank him for this and his willingness to help. I have know him by many names Talhan, Kizor and others. But the name I will always know him by is Trackgor.

</FONT><HR>1.  You state that the Paladin is the defensive and the Ranger the offensive sides of the Warrior coin.<P>Equiping both a Ranger and Paladin in Kunark armor, the Paladin will have approximately 24 more AC than the Ranger.  You add to this the fact that the lvl 51 Ranger can add another 54 AC from self buffs that stack with Cleric buffs, and the Ranger actually has a higher AC than the "defensive" side of the so called coin.<P>2.  The spells on our Kunark armor are simply horrendous.  Warrior/Monks/Rogues/Bards all get spells that they didn't have.  Very useful spell effects.  We get stuff that wasn't used when we got the spells initially.<P>3.  Quests.  Monks/Rogues/Warriors/Necros/Mage/Enchanter/SK/Bard can all now quest for an item that teleports them to Overthere.  Rangers/Druids/Wizards all have items or the spells to TP themselves to one place or another.  Even evil Clerics can get the hammer in OT.<P>This leaves only the Paladin that has an quest or class specific item that will allow travel.<P>You've given Warriors/Rogues/Bards unlimited healing with their Kunark BPs, you've given Warrios/SKs invisibility with other BPs from Chardok.

</FONT><HR>Hi Absor, and thanks for the time you take to read this...<P>I went through all of the 3 "paly talks" and here are my thoughts : <P>- paladin should get a defense above all class, like 272... The fact is that for now, warriors are the best tanks, and at the same time a really good damage dealing class, giving them 2 advantages. This is ruining the game...What i'd like to see is for example a rogue/monk grouping with a paladin being as efficient as 2 warriors... Warrior should be the average class, not the ultimate one like now...<P>-Following this it makes sense to have parry/dodge and so as high as a warrior.<P>-Adding my support to all the ideas concerning Bash, LoH and Stun.<P>-As some have already said, there is a real problem concerning the paladin equipment being 1hs, shields or armors.<P>-This is not balance related, but as said before, some quest are just a pain, due to low drop rate of items...To Vox books and Ro armor components, i'll add the winning ticket needed for the silent watch shield (i personnaly tried to get it more than 40 times with no luck)<P>Thanks for the time took to read this.<P>-PS : I fell the paladin talk has been one of the most involved in balance issue, and you have certainly seen how much players are/have been decieved regarding how paladins problems have rarely been took into account (if ever)...<BR>Letting this continue would for sure have you loosing customers, or worst , have them act against you.... </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Please bring the idea of 10 points across the board for skill caps to the team as an alternative to the current 252 caps.  Yes, 252 defense will help us do our intended job as a tank, but it makes us totally one-sided.  What is so wrong with giving paladins 10 skill points to offense and weapon skills?  It would close the gap in melee damage output only a little bit, but it would give us a better chance of landing our swings.  I've read that paladins miss 50 to 52 percent of their swings - that's WAY too many misses.  Yes, we need defense improvements to help us fill our role as tanks, but we also need offense improvements because we are so far behind in melee damage output.<P>Also, please consider the paladin disciplines.  The one thing we need most in the high end game is a raid useable discipline, preferrably of a defensive nature.  Paladins are not of much use on large raids and are therefore not wanted.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

That is most important to myself, and many other paladins I know.  I want to be able to assure my caster friends that I will be able to taunt our enemies from them effectively, and save their lives.  We need to have more sword and shield combinations that are for paladins--not meant to be dual wielded.  One of the best ideas I have seen is to quest upgrades for ghoulbane--I still use this weapon after 26 levels, and will keep using it until I have to turn it in for my Fiery Avenger.  It is one of our best weapons--allowing upgrades would be a great touch.<P>Keep the thread alive.  We have much to discuss.<BR>Paulo Al'Deln &lt;Assembly of Norrath&gt;<BR>46th Knight of Truth<BR>Tunare Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I would to start off saying that as a lvl 58  Paladin that I know what a Paladin can and cannot do. This is my perspective of how I play my paladin.<P>First off we can secondary tank, and main tank if no warriors are available.  By this I mean be the main damage taker.  To do this we have to gear up for AC and HP.  Str and Wis are not even big considerations when gearing up to take damage.  Even with doing everything we can we still fall way short of warriors.  I can get 3800hp with every buff I can think of where as I have seen warriors with 5k.  That is a BIG difference.  We wont replace them in this area.  Even upping defense skills will not come close them.   Since most pallys go for HP/AC or STR our wis is very low which means we cannot cast many of the bigger spells.  I am very luck to cast Naltron on our whole party before I am OOM. I have played prime healer with my paladin at lvl 57, let me tell you every fight being oom is not a fun way to play!!<P>We are NOT a damage dealer.  That is a fact.  Nuking clerics can do more damage then we can in a fight.  I have long since turned off my misses to reduce the spam while fighting.  Every time I get a new weapon I turn it back on and see if it changes and it never has.  Without epic class weapons we cannot even come close to duel wielding classes in damage output.  Most paladins choose to go to a  one hand weapons to give them more ac/hp with shields and give us bash which is very useful for stopping casters.  The problem is that bash does very little damage and fails a lot.  This also leaves us with using HALF the weaponry that the other melee classes use.  On top of it our 1hs is lower in skill then the skills of other classes.  How does this make sense?  Even if you increased our 1 hand weapons to the same level as warriors we still only use 1 weapon vs their two weapons.  We dont have a damage kick, criticals hits, crippling blows, or offensive disciplines.  For the balance I agree that we shouldnt raise our 2hs up to the same level as warriors, even though they get better weapons that enable them to do more damage with 2h then pallys will.  This will at least make us usable in offensive situations.<P>On major raids like dragon runs the biggest concern is resist gear.  Once you gear up for resists pallys loose a great deal of HP/AC.  Its like fighting naked, ever tried that? If you have you know you dont last long.  So these raids are all about offensive.  Putting out the most damage in the least amount of time.  You CANNOT win against dragons if the fight drags on for a long time, their AOE weapons will defeat you and you run out of mana for heals.  So why should Paladins be invited for a dragon run?  We are using 1hs weapons and a resist shield so our damage output is very low.  We do not have any real damage type spells ( at least none worth casting).  Right now the only thing that I can put to a dragon raid (besides leading) is to give 3k (buffed with HL buffs) HP buffer between casters and the mob and a lay hands on an important class just before I die.  Superior heal is nice, but against a mob hitting for 520 a pop its worthless and takes to long to cast.   Some discipline changes would be nice but really just bring us up to doing some modest damage or strong defense would make us worth while for raids.  <P>Our healing ability is fine for long drawn out fights where mana becomes scarce with the healers, or after combat healing.  Once all healers are oom and the mob is almost down a paladin can stop fighting and dump his mana into the group to try to buy some time for another CH.  I must say that I have been in these situations a number of times and its an awesome feeling to know that having just done something to contribute to the groups success but it doesnt happen enough to secure a paladins place in groups.  Besides that I almost never use my mana for anything other then stuns. <P>Right now a paladin is a great utility class when you dont have any of the pure classes available.  Our only defining ability is Lay hands and that really doesnt heal much when considering that a 5k warrior might barly notice you have just LH them (yes I this has happened to me!).  If it was CH how would that hurt?  Against uber mobs it would mean 20 secs more for a warrior  to live vs 10 sec now.  How again does that hurt the balance? For the rest of the people we use it on it completely heals them but since tanks have higher hp it falls way short.  So we are really talking about a minor improvement.<P>Plug about our epic weapons  Why on earth did you include the first FA with the second FD.  You knew that you nerfed the first one when you made naggy/vox 53-.  Why didnt you keep them different quests!  Or even delete the original FA and just have the FD!  This is a MAJOR problem that is just wrong!  You know its wrong because you tried to fix it with the kunark dragons, but you had to make those dragons so damn hard that it wouldnt disturb the balance.  So your fix to the problem has caused more balance problems then any real solution to the problem.  How does this make sense?  I like long hard quests but please at least let me have a chance of doing the quest without begging lower levels for help!  Address this, if not in the balance issue, address it somewhere else!!!!!  Its killing the high level paladin class.<P>Summary<P>Raise paladins 1 hand weapons up to warrior level- wont disturb balance since we dont have as good of weapons and dont duel wield so we will not even come close to warriors/rogues/rangers/monks for damage.  Keep 2hs to current levels.  Whoever said that warriors needed to be the only ones that are good with their 1h weapons?<P>Raise skill for bash  - We are one of the few classes that even use it. <P>Increase LH to CH  this will only effect targets that have very high HP so its a very small change to the over all effect.<P>Give us a faster heal to help backup the healers.  With the limited mana supply we can NEVER replace a pure class.<P>For SoV mobs we need a way to have stuns to be effective.  Either a non-damage stun that will interrupt or make our existing stuns be more effective.<P>Redo our disciplines to something useable.<P>Also please post a review of topics you will be submitting. You have split the talks once and did not even take the time to really list any of the items that are added to the list so we can stop going over them time and again.  If you do this then we can concentrate on other issues and stop beating a dead horse!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm sick of folks repeating stuff. /comfort Absor<P>*sigh*<P>I'm worried about the new changes on test server. Giving shaman better heals is a good idea. Giving druids is bad.. they are popular now because of ease of use, if you give them that, there will be even more of them then they are now. And too many druids quite frankly are horrible.  My best partner is a druid, and he rocks.. But he'll rock just reducing the fizzle rate on Superiour heal.  Give them another chloroplast upgrade if you need more.  At least try to increment in stages. Clerics have a point... clerics are BORING to play.<P>Balance is when...<P>                          1. healer slot is filled by cleric or druid/shaman combo<BR>                          2. tank slot is filled by warrior or pal/sk combo<BR>                          3. crowd control slot is filled by enchanter or bard/necro combo<BR>                          4. damage dealer slot (melee) is filled by monk/rogue/ranger (no real primary here).<BR>                          5. damage dealer slot (magic) is filled by wizard or mage/necro combo<P>                          That's 15 classes btw. Pretty sure I didnt' miss anyone. No single class should be a required part.

</FONT><HR>I don't have time to read all this right now, just gonna post what I've found in 56 lvls of playing a pally.<P>Let me start by saying the changes on test are a good start at least... altho Celestial Cleansing looks somewhat disappointing becuase of our already dimishing spell slot size.<P>Ok anyway, these are my main concerns in order:<BR>Compensation for 56+ creatures and the fact that thier spells cannot be interuppted by our stuns. Stuns are the main thing a paladin does 49+, its a paladins job.. its his specialty. Yet on 56+ monsters we lose this... and no other classes lose thier main class ability becuase creatures are 56+, nor do they even lose thier sub ablities.<BR>Enchanters get GoK to mezz these creatures, maybe we could get another stun like that... even better just make stuns interrupt 56+ creatures casting, just not stun them.<P>Our contribution on high lvl raids is way off balance with other classes. Rangers can do tons of melee damage, use Trueshot, add some nice stackable buffs, or tank the uber mob with riposte disc for 20secs. SKs can Harmtouch at least (I do think they need some more for big raids also). Paladins on the other hand can add 200hps to people IF they are 60 and IF that person wouldn't prefer the level 50 ranger buff, thats all we contribute on large raids (and minor damage, so slight in some cases I don't even fight due to the lag I'd cause.)<BR>I'm not sure as the raid contribution we should have, I'll leave that up to you guys. But I do think its obvious that we need a disc to replace one of the jokes we currently have to make us somewhat desireable on large/uber mob raids.<P>I'd like to talk about Parent Class Groupablity and Stackable buffs now... Paladins are the unique hybrid in that one of thier parent classes is REQUIRED in groups at high lvls. Rangers can go however long they want to without grouping with Warrior or Druid, SK can go forever with not grouping with necro or warrior.<BR>Paladin can go forever not groupign with a warrior, but CLERICS ARE NECESSARY. I think says alot when you think about it, if you need more clarification on this just ask tho.<BR>Being how the above is, and being that clerics are THE buffing class. I wonder sometimes why rangers get better stackable buffs than paladins do (Rangers get Feet Like Cat(15), Call of Sky(50), thier 60 group buff... not to mention Damage Shields and Chloroplast : Paladins get 1 stackable buff at lvl 60, and most people would rather have Call of Sky over our buff)<BR>So what could you do to relieve this situation? Add some more punch to Divine Strenght, ie more HPs and some AC. Add a upgrade to Divine Strenght that costs a peridot and move Divine Str down in lvls. Give us Naltrons Mark sometime.<BR>Paladins are part of the best buffing class in the game, but please remember that Clerics are always needed in groups at high lvls.. so the paladin buffs are pretty unusable as cleric buffs are always better. Rangers are better buffers in groups than paladins, I don't see the logic behind this.<P>Bashing cap, up up up up up! =)<P>A few spells that i have slight problems with:<BR>Wave of Healing: 450mana for 200pt group heal, with a 1 min recast time. This is WAY too much mana!! 380 ok, but 450 is just nutz with no specializtion (we need specialization too =P)<P>Divine Favour: 150pt rune, with a THREE minute recast time. You'd think with a 3 min recast time this spell could mitigate more than 150hps...<P>Divine Might: Do to the difficulty of the quest, and the recent addition of Boon of Garou... it would be nice to add and AC or Attack factor to this spell. I really hate to see a spell that took so much hard work for me and my guild go to the side and not be used. And AC or Attack factor would make it preferable over Boon of Garou... right now its a toss up, and I usually choose Boon... and once again, enchanters are needed in all high lvl groups.<P>Thanks for you time, and have fun with the balancing, hehe =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Personally, I think Alan is crazy to do all these class threads at once...it's a wonder he can think straight let alone put together a coherant response.<P>One thing I've always wondered...why clerics, who are healers, have the strike and yaulp line of spells?  Clerics who actually use them are basically not playing to their potential. They are in effect 'wasting' mana that could be used for heals, rezzes and buffs. (Of course, that would make being a cleric even more boring than they already are, but that's a different topic). OK, back to the subject of paladin and balance.<P>I agree with those pally's that say that to be a watered down anything is not what we are about. Pally's need a whole identity of their own.<P>What I would love to see is paladins to be more diety based. As an example:<P>1) RN followers have a higher wis or mana base in order to heal better. Also, it's a bit odd to have the imbued armor/jewelry of the Prime Healer have stamina as it's primary stat.<P>2) Karana followers have higher strength and a higher stun/force ratio.<P>3) EM followers have the ability to "sacrifice" themselves in order to save a groupmate.<P>4) MM followers have crits and stronger attacks/spells against undead.<P>5) Tunare followers being more in touch with nature being able to snare/root more effectively.<P>6) Quellious followers being pacifist being able to lull/pacify better.<P>7) Brell Serilis followers be able to sense underground faults (traps and secret doors)and added strength when underground (ie dungeons).<P>8) Prexus followers be better swimmers and fighters in water.<P>While these aren't exactly 'balance' issues, they certainly would add flavor and variety.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
