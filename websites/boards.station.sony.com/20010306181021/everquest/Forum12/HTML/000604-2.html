</FONT><HR>------------------------------------------------<BR>"A lvl 60 shaman that casts slow on all the mobs prevents more damage than I will with crowd control on a 4 mob pull! Adding a rogue as a third melee class prevents more damage than an enchanter can on a 2 mob pull."<P>Neither of these is true. The difference between your slows at level 60 is not very big. Forelorn Deeds is an UBER slow. The shaman slows them down to doing about 20% of the damage they did before. You slow them down to 0% by mezzing. This is a totally ridiculous statement.<BR>-------------------------------------------------<P>Cast slow on all the mobs. You've reduced the damage each mob does by 80%, and thus you've reduced the total damage taken by the mobs by 80%<P>Doing crowd control on 4 mobs only reduces the damage taken by 60%.<P>And do notice I was saying damage prevention by crowd control. :P  I've read that a lot of 55+ enchanters really dislike slowing because one mez + one slow and once it wakes up you're tanking until it dies.<P><BR>If you want tanks to "regain the power they already had" then go have them fight lvl 4 mobs. At lvl 3, my wizard was tanking 6 lvl 1 mobs at once and AE nuking them to death. I think my wizard should regain the power she already had.<P><BR>You said you want tanks to be able to tank well enough for a group to be able to handle 3 mob pulls without an enchanter. I.E. you want them to be 2 times as powerful to make up for the crowd control, 1.7 times as powerful to make up for haste and another 3.3 times as powerful to make up for slows. That's over 11 times more powerful. :P<P>You STILL CAN take any group of 6 people 50+ and give them someplace to fight, I'm sorry if it doesn't happen to be the place you want to fight. It's like looking at the Indy 500 and complaining that your 85 Dodge Lancer isn't good enough to race and that any car should be viable.<P>Bottom line: There are places where a good mix of classes can fight where a bad mix of classes can't. It makes sense. It's the way things should be. You should NOT be able to go to one of the harder places in the world with a bad group. Turning all the hard places into easy places is NOT an acceptable fix for the CC problem.<P>Arlina</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Twib, where the hell were ya when i was shouting for a group at level 15 in oasis?<P>How many times do you see "Group looking for an enchanter" before you get past the "lets go hunt specs for xp" stage?<P>How many enchanters have you seen utter the words, "Boy... I REALLY like vellious!"<P>/sarcasm<BR>And you know what... it pisses me off that clerics are so good at healing. I mean, they just sit there and... HEAL! I can't beleive it, their job is so easy. They get invited to groups all the time 'cause they are such an overpowered class. My ranger can't get into a group to be primary healer because this class is such an uber healer. AND they get to wear PLATE!<BR>/sarcasm off <P>When a group gets a bad pull, who usually dies first? Noooo its usually not the puller. Its... *drumroll* the ENCHANTER!! See when you cast mezmirize on an uninitiated mob, this has one of two effects:<P>1)you successfully park a mob.<BR>2)you resist, and aggro the mob, and possibly more than one. Mobs don't like to be mezzed. At all. <P>But, thankfully, enchanters have this godlike AC buff so its not a problem. Nevermind that we can die within 2-3 rounds in ol' seb. Nevermind that an uncoordinated group will kill their enchanter REAL QUICK. Nevermind that I have to keep a stopwatch handy thanks to haste taking up to 50% of my mana in a melee heavy group (remember, 99.9% of us don't have an epic weapon).<P>Fact is, enchanters are NOT overpowered. They are VERY hard to play. The mana balancing alone is a chore. Let alone timing a mezzed mob so the train you stopped doesn't wake up and kill you before your group finishes on its mob.<P>And there are other factors...<P>1)we are buff vendors in vellious, nothing more.<BR>2)on epic battles (naggy, vox, CT, inny), we get to... haste the tanks, clarity the casters and take screenshots. wee.<BR>3)Enchanter!=soloer. You need jboots to solo just about anything, or corner a druid/shaman/ranger who happens to be hunting the same area. <BR>4)Enchanter DD makes a cleric look like a wizard.<BR>5)Enchanter Dot makes a ranger look like a necro.<BR>6)You rely on the mercy of groups to invite you before level 29. No, breeze and enthrall aren't that much of a motivator.<BR>7)most encounters DO NOT require crowd control. <BR>8)Our pet makes a mage pet look like a warrior.<BR>9)See #7<BR>10)You can have multiple tanks, healers or damage casters in a group. Ever see 2 enchanters in a singe (non-raid) group? There's a reason for that.<BR>11)see #7<BR>12)Runes cost money to keep YOUR sorry butt alive.<BR>13)We have no single target stuns, and there is this wonderful thing called a z-axis... ever AE in unrest?<P>So, yea, I can see your point. We're overpowered tremendously. And its such an easy class to play that its downright boring. I should start a cleric.<P>okay /sarcasm really off now.<P>Take your class envy, look it over real carefully, turn it sideways and shove it. Nobody is forcing you to group with us.<P>-Ayla</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree with most things...  Enchanters are necessary though I wouldn't call them overpowered.  Unless necessary = overpowered to you.<P>The necessity of the enchanter is prevalent from about level 30 all the way to the top, but unfortunately at the highest levels the crowd control (and therefore the fun of the entire class) drops out of the equation.<P>Dragons, gods, high level mobs, and 100% MR mobs are so prevalent in Velious that Enchanters are reduced to the task of buffing.  Not even our haste debuffs will land on a 100% magic resistant mob.<P>So, we clarity and speed.  Period.<P>Mayhap we are still necessary (or "overpowered") at this stage, but it sure as heck isn't any fun.  This is why, when the Enchanter Talk begins I wish to advocate a high level short duration high mana cost high recast time mez.  This mez should impact some (but not all) of these higher level mobs and restore the fun of our class.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OK, so I am another Enchanter. You obviously have some issues that you take seriously, but maybe you can answer a question.<P>What exactly would you have us do or done to use to even things out?<P>Give other classes our skills (which alot do in some form anyway) and you might as well remove the whole enchanter class. I guess we could forget about being part in any uber fights and stick to what select few mobs we can solo (and in no productive way mind you). Perhaps we will be “allowed” in groups for the direct damage we can do, but then again, a Cleric can do more (plus heal you) and Ive seen named MOBs actually HEAL when all that’s left on them is my one DoT. Maybe the best thing for us to do is play pranks with illusions, make you Jewelry (at just cost of the materials of course) and sit on our butts in newbie areas and pass out buffs.<P>You spent half your EQ life turning us away and for some reason you want to continue in your latter levels. You want to actually remove what little reward we receive for working twice as hard. I spent my whole enchanter life watching friends and others move up past me. I saw their pride in the new items they obtained while I was limited thanks to multiple stats that I had to maintain. When I was new and lucky to get in the group, I was the first if not only one dead or the last one out (if I was lucky) when death was eminent. All of this and much more to finally come to a point where I can join in the game.<P>Are we godlike? FAR from it<BR>Are we over-needed? At later levels, I can see where you are coming from, but I feel as if you have gone way overboard.<P>I'm serious about the question. I really would like to know what you have in mind. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>well dang wish i had known i was supposed to be "godlike" in my powers...as a 53 enchanter and having played this char longer then the lvl 60 druid and the 58 monk in my guild i realized one thing only.....while i NEED a group, groups can and do get by just fine without me. its easier to have one but you can live without em.<P>go into the hole with any enchanter and get more then halfway thru the dungeon and then ask em hows the crowd control going....most likely you will be talking to a corpse cuz half the stuff is UNMEZABLE we just became useless....<P>try casting clarity on anyone that is grouped with a 50+ bard playing their 2nd mana song..it wont take hold we just became useless....<P>try slowing a mob while grouped with a shaman it wont take hold we just became useless.....<P>ohhh we can speed those tanks up...oh wait they all have haste items and just need a small haste (which the shaman can cover) to max out the haste effect we jsut became useless....<P><BR>we just make it easier doing all things that others can do and most times do better then us...crowd control can be covered by necros and bards with their versions of mez and there are alternatives to mez (ie. root parking that someone mentioned earlier) and with root / snare stacking now that isnt even a problem anymore - as for the comment of root not working cuz a mob hits 250 per round dont root it so close <P>bards and shaman can cover the speeds granted our speed is nicer but its a waste when those same tanks have haste items making the higher versions of the spell a waste<P>clarity - bard song - necros lich themselves so clarity doenst take hold and they "twitch" the clerics so they can do without clarity shaman canabalize, wizards harvest and mages use mod rods (not mana efficient but it works) plus you add in manastones a few other items that have the mana conversion spells on them and enchanters once again just make it more convenient<P>and finally we come to slowing the mobs the shaman spells far surpass us in power on this spell a 50+ shaman and a 50+ enchanter both slow shaman slow is better by far then the enchanter slow<P>you may hate us but you will still look for one for your group for the simple fact that its convenient to you. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>God what a moron you are Twipple.  Enchanters are one of the hardest classes to level, we're not wanted like everybody else pre-level 29.  29, really 34, is when we come into our own, and our hard work pays off.  29 levels we have to wait before people will even acknowledge us, and start searching for us.  Are we overpowered?  C'mon, thats like saying Clerics are overpowered in healing, or Warriors tank to good.  Give me a break.  We are enchanters, we help your mental abilities and some of your physicall, and we control crowds, thats OUR job.  We cant tank, we cant heal, we get pets that we dont use, we get bad Direct Damage spells with an extremely high taunt factor and a long recast time, crowd control is OUR area, what WE do best, like a Cleric heals best, and a Warrior tanks best.  Get a clue and stop being class envious and trying to post something that makes sense, when its nothing but childish, and jealousy motivated.  You hate a class because they are needed at high levels?  Funny.  <P>Did you know Clerics are absolutely needed at higher levels?  Did you know so are warriors, and monks and rogues?

</FONT><HR>Clarity and bard song stack; for some reason you just have to make sure to cast clarity when the bard stops singing mana song. Once clarity sticks, then the bard can sing mana song and you have both.<P>As for haste and haste items, it is no longer true that haste item + haste spell = haste cap; an enchanter haste that has much more haste than a bard song winds up actually hasting the tank a lot more.<P>Arlina</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Okay I have played an enchanter 3 times<BR>Yes I have seen a NON raid group with more then 1 enchanter.  3 of us to be exact, 2 chain stunning one nuking.  No one died, heck I don't think anyone of the 5 of us got under 2 bubbles of health.<BR>A group can get away without an enchanter if they use a few tricks (yes even those at high levels)  Necros and bards can mez, bards can charm.  There is also the ole root fall back root fall back (and my preferred way to mez, mez one pull back rinse repeat makes nice clean lines and easier to target.)<BR>Saying that chanters are over powered at 50+ is like saying that any class is over powered at 50+.  Heck I know of at least 2 or 3 monks who should personally be nerfed as they do so much damage it is unreal.  Any class post 50 can be very powerful, it is really all in how you play your character.  <BR>As for grouping it depends on your server.  I never had a problem in the early stages getting a group.  Once I established a core group of people who I worked with then grouping from that point on got even easier.  Yes it can be difficult to get a group if you log on after groups are made, but sometimes you have to place importance on other things you can do.  At 16+ ANY enchanter can make a mob slower, the group faster, the mob weaker, the group stronger, and can at the same time lower the mobs agility.  When doing this to say a hill giant at level 35 you go from getting hit at 90 hit points a pop to more of an average of 60-75.  Plus your group misses less often.  <BR>Another thing, chanters pets.. well I still rarely use mine (but hey I am in a dungeon alot) but soloing I do prefer to use my duel wielding pet with SLTW and a rune shield.<BR>Also with clarity II on you and Theft of Thought chanters now rarely run out of mana.  But then again the fights last longer.<BR>I am sorry if you don't think that tanks cannot tank anymore.  I for one have had 4 mobs that have needed to be mezzed, gotten maybe one mezzed, got resisted on another , died and died quickly of which sent the cleric to very low mana trying to heal me and suprisingly the tanks just keep tanking and taking out the mobs.  I have watched tanks tank solo planes mobs in PoG, Hate, Fear, and Sky and have not seen them suffer from a lack of being able to go toe to toe.  In fact I play a low level sk.  That character can take down a yellow fairly easy where with my other low level chanter I wouldn't even think of anything but a blue. (Heck as a 50+ enchanter I won't solo anything but a low low blue it hurts to much)<BR>Enchatners are no more powerful alone then many other classes.  It is only in our most prevelant situation aka in a group at which we excel.  We have many different routes and roles we can contribute to a group buffs, debuffs, and some nuking power which is waht really makes us desirable.  Enchanters can make life easier on a group just like a cleric makes life easier on a group.  Yes both classes can be replaced with other classes and the same result occurs, but in the way of things most people would prefer the easiest route.  If you are tired of not being able to get a group without a cleric/enchanter then I suggest you find people on your server who play some of the alternative classes to these (see list above shammy/druid as healer) and work out a few techniques.  Once you have a little practice you will find that you can do many of the 50+ zones fairly well with neither.  It also helps if you have a monk or sk that can FD pull in some areas to seperate out the mobs.<BR>Celara Starshine<BR>Enchantress of the 52nd Season<BR>Requiem Despair<BR>Torvonnilous</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bah I agree with Twip.  Enchanters are way overpowered throughout their life.  Hard to play? Bah, just like anything else in the game.  Know your mobs and know thine self.  Every class has a strategy, though pure fighters easier.  It's just about combo of spells and knowing what’s going on around you.  Same thing as any other caster.  Some people like to think they so smart cause they play an Enc.  Well you don't fool people who’ve been there.  The hardest part about playing an Enc is keeping track of all the spells Verant was so nice to give you.  Why the heck to Enchanters have pets for gods sake?  Verant, "Lets see we gave Enc the ability to slow, speed, buff, debuff, fear, charm, root, DD, dot, true mana regen, mezz and wipe memory, what did we miss?  Oh lets give them a pet.  Then how do we differentiate them from Magi?  We'll just give the Magi a pet some summoned items anyone could buy cheap and a Single Debuff. We'll let the Magi tell his pet to attack and call it balanced.  Should we give the Magi more damaging burns?  No we'll make the Enc dd have a slight refresh delay and call it balanced."   <P>What's worse then an Enc?  Whiney Enc!  I didn't know there was any other kind.<P>They are too powerful and necessary over other classes and should be NERFED!<P><BR>And Please do flame me or this won't be any fun  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>True<BR>My enchatner the next time I played them was much easier.  In fact I have soloed her easily through 10 levels and will propably easily solo her through 20 if I wish.  Yes we may get all those tools, but we are also plagued with low HPs, LOW AC (and many of our armor items are low AC as well).  Have you ever checked out chanter planer armor as well.  For the most part it is relatively rare (been to hate at least 10 times seen about 10 pieces drop).  I will admit that the PoG armor is just unbelievable but a lot of Velious items are as well.  One more note, do a comparision someday of the number of high level enchanters vs other classes.  If it is true like on my server their is a significant less number of them.  This is becuase the class does go through difficulty (basically 3 whacks and you are dead) and weeds people out.  Do I see Verant nerfing enchanters any time soon, I don't think so.  In order to take away our spell casting varitey and power they would basically have to up the gear available to use adding major AC and HPs to us in order to be able to survive a fight.  What do you want us to be as useful as a ranger (sorry its a running joke in my guild)<BR>Celara Starshine<BR>Requiem Despair <BR>Torv</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is my last post on this thread.  I don't feel that anyone is doing anything more than 1) defending themselves trying to avoid the appearance that they need a nerf, 2) flaming because they have nothing better to do, and 3) being totally disrespectful.  I hear that Verant is going to be handing out warnings to people for calling each other idiots and such on these boards.  I sure hope they take a look at this thread...<P><BR>1)  I've just read from my last post on down.  Didn't read most of them in their entirety due to most of them having nothing to do with the argument at hand - enchanters are overly necessary because of the weakness of the other classes (mostly the tanks imo).  Everyone seems satisfied with whining about how enchanters die first and how hard they are to level up and such.  Boy if being that powerful were an option for all classes simply by dying the most often, I'll bet a large number of people would start running around the canyons in Overthere in the dark while AFK.<P>2)  These Velious arguments are also quite off-topic.  I play a wizard as well, and I could just as easily complain about the fact that warriors out-damage me when I unload full mana into these 30k hitpoint mobs because I do my 7k from full mana, sit down to med, while they do their uber melee all the way down 'til it's dead.  And then they've ended up doing more mana, yet I'm the 'master of killing things quickly.'  Scrolling up, I don't seem to remember any such complaining.  IMO, all the classes are either severely over- or under-powered in Velious.  Namely Warriors, Clerics, and pet classes being on the ups.<P>3)  Any of you enchanters who think that your class is not a necessisty in a *LARGE* number of situations at higher level is in denial.  And if any of you accept that and feel that is okay, you don't really understand what the words 'class balance' mean.  Let me expound on this point.  Does anyone remember about six months ago when Diablo 2 came out and lots of your friends stopped playing for nearly a month because they were hooked on D2?  Why is that?  Because in D2 you're never SOL.  Any combination (**ANY** combination) of characters in Diablo 2 could work together effectively and entertainingly.  Not true in EQ.  You've got to set up that near-perfect group consisting of an enchanter and a cleric.  Most people, in my experience, aren't too interested in joining until you have both.  And then once you finally get all the people you need, finally one of them leaves after about half an hour and you're back at the zone for 2.5 more hours looking for a replacement.  D2 dropped off because of it's limited nature and it's redundancy and lack of dynamic (which can only be included in a MMORPG).  EverQuest has the latter, but it no-longer has the former.  Back in the days of level 10, any number of any combination of classes could sit down, group up, and have a blast.  Want to add a warrior?  Sure.  Necro is leaving.  Np.  Add a druid?  Sweet.  Warrior is leaving.  Add a monk?  Sure.  5 minutes to get a group, hours of playing, and no stops due to the absence of the two 'god classes' as I like to call them.  (clerics and enchanters of course).<P><BR>Enjoy your sarcastic, insulting, pointless jibes.  Hopefully someone who is really bored will start reading them and be offended, because I've had my fill.  I'm gonna go get 60.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I do not disagree that enchanters are necessary in most groups in a dungeon setting above level 30.  That being said, I would say that there are 2 classes who's primary function is to buff.  Enchanter (speed and clarity) and Shaman.  Shaman get to do damage, they have very nice DOT's and DD.  Enchanters get crowd control.  I would not place speed and mana regen into seperate catagories.  They are buffs.  Enchanters and Shaman also get debuffs.  Both can slow/weaken etc.  Shaman have the better slows.  Enchanters, as a trade off get the better speed buff.  I am still failing to see any problems.  I play a 54 enchanter on rodcet nife, and I believe you could find many people who find grouping with me is a pleasure.  If you have a problem with enchanters and clerics acting like Gods, or whatever that drivel was you spewed, it sounds to me like you have a problem with some individuals, don't blame the class as a whole.  On the "uber" raids we play a big role in getting there, but usually not much in the big fight.  We get do the fun stuff like take Innoruuk's first DT and stuff like that.  Our nukes get resisted like mad, and at lvl 54 the last nuke I get is 615 damage.  The primary difference between an Enchanter and EVERY OTHER CLASS is that we do not specialize in doing damage of any kind.  9 times out of 10 I do not have a nuke or dot memmed at all.  So how is a class that does not do damage over powered in the slightest?  I think yor biggest problem is not that enchanters make it easy to fight one mob at a time, but that you play a tank and don't like getting your butt kicked post 30.  The big bad &lt;insert general tank here&gt; needs other people in a group.  If you don't like what enchanters do in a group, don't invite one.  But do NOT take out all your anger and frustration on ME because I chose a class that favors finess, favors brains over balls, and favors helping others over being some kind of hero.<P>Matil Trynstum<BR>54 Enchanter<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hmm well I guess you did not read many of the posts as it has been said that you can do large raids without enchanters.  Yes I have seen planes raids go with only 1 enchanter and for part of that same raid there was no enchanter.  Enchanters JUST MAKE IT EASIER.  Heck who doesn't want to make it easier.  But (if you want to call us all close minded) it is yourself that you will find is close minded because you haven't sat down and figured out a way around the lack of an enchanter.  Yes there is a way you just have to be a bit ingenious to use OTHER tools that OTHER classes have that can accomplish the same thing that the Enchanters tools can do.  I have found myself in rather strange groups before (chanter, mage, druid, druid, druid) in 40+ zones and we had to make do.  Instead of whining that we had no tank, we used the skills and techniques that each class had.  Fear kiting in Burning woods with a mage pet tanking works, or grab a root pet let it tank and the chanter either summons there pet to also tank or just goes and grabs a tank (those monkeys make great ones).  Since it seems that most people cannot get off the subject of need versus ease you will forever be stuck in the rut of looking for an enchanter.  I can tell you I go on planes raids and spend 80% of my time at FM sitting on my butt becuase even with 2-3 groups we can tank 2 to 3 mobs easy.  Heck I spend most of my time in groups acting like a nuker as my groups have gotten very good at making me useless. (what good is having me to mez when you only get 1 mob gotta love those FD pulls).  Again I suggest that you just take the time to try a few techniques and see what you can do without a chanter.  It can and does happen.  Not every group can or will have a chanter and some people sit around and whine about it, while others construct techniques to use when the preferred method is not available.<P><BR>Make Do and go on.  This isn't an issue of the power of an enchanter,  It IS an issue of how important an enchanter is percieved to be for a group.  Understand that some people will always and only do it the easy way, but there are those out there that actaully like a challenge and go about figuring out how to do an area with the classes and races they have available.  <P>Sorry to say this, but my guild does the Plane of Growth with no chanter assistance EXCEPT for buffing between battles.  Clarity and speed nothing more nothing less, no mezzing, no debuffs, NOTHING and even that is really not helping that much as they could STILL do the raid with no chanter assistance at all.<P>Believe what you want about the power of an enchanter, nothing we say will ever change your mind, but do take some advice and before you complain about what power we hold over a group just at least make an attempt to come up with some ideas of what you would do without a chanter.  <P>Heck if they nerfed us you would be in the same boat you are now anyway.  No one in your group to do Buffing, Debuffing, Mezzing, mana regen etc..  <BR>Celara Starshine<BR>Enchantress of 52 seasons<BR>Requiem Despair<BR>Torv</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is the opinion of a level 47 enchanter, who's nowhere near as smart as some of the mathmeticians that have posted here already.<P>Twipple is right.  This doesn't mean he's nice, and he isn't exactly positive why he's right, but he IS right.  <P>Though the reason he's right has been touched on, it hasn't fully been broken down, like I'm about to attempt to do.<P>THE REASON:  The reason that enchanters have become so valuable these days is because, post-Kunark, mobs have double the hit points and double the attack/damage per second, as they used to have.  These are approximations, of course, but I think they will serve.<P>EFFECT 1 of tougher mobs:  Warriors and tanks in general are not as effective as they once were.  For example, let us say that in the old days, when tanks could tank, a good tank could handle a single mob, solo, but just barely.  Now, let's take a Kunark mob, as I described above.  Since this mob has twice the HPs, a tank can only tank it until it's half health.  But wait, it's hitting twice as hard, while the tank has the SAME number of HPs.  That means the tank's dead while the mob is still 3/4 health.  Which means, the tank's effectiveness has been reduced to 25% of what it was.<P>EFFECT 2 of tougher mobs:  Wizards are not as effective as they once were.  Whereas in the past a wizard with full mana could completely kill a mob, assuming he wasn't killed first, with that mana, now he can no longer do so.  Since the mobs have twice the HPs, a wizard can only halfways kill the mob.  And with the mob's higher attack, the wizard must be even more cautious about nuking.  So, a wizard is only 50% as effective as he once was, and perhaps less so, when you take into account agro and taunt.<P>EFFECT 3 of tougher mobs:  Clerics, while more necessary, are also less effective.  Pre-Kunark, they could emerge from a single mob encounter with 4 bubbles of mana, having cast just a single C-heal, while the tanks did their job, and the wizard put the burn on it before it got out of hand.  Now a cleric would have to use a lot more mana, since the mobs are doing more damage, and also able to TAKE more damage.<P>EFFECT 4 of tougher mobs:  Enchanters are MORE effective!!!  How?  Well, in the past an enchanter mesmerizing a single mob was helpful, saving, let's say 25 points of damage per second, throughout the time the mezz was maintained.  So, given a 1 minute kill time per mob, an enchanter would have saved the cleric having to heal an extra 1500 points of damage from the second mob.<P>But NOW, post-Kunark, the same mezz would prevent 50 POINTS OF DAMAGE for 2 MINUTES, because the mobs hit that much harder, and take that much longer to be dispatched.  Yet, it's the same spell, for the same mana, suddenly made 4 times more effective.<P>The same is true of slow spells.  Back in the good old days, slow was a handy spell.  Slow cast on a mob from my above example would reduce the DPS to 12.5 from 25.  Nice, but you really didn't save the cleric a ton of mana, probably not more than it COST you to cast.<P>However, post-Kunark, you'd be reducing the DPS from 50 to 25 for TWICE as long as before.  The same spell is 4 times as effective, though it's the exact same spell for the exact same mana! Consider that it's reducing half from a significantly larger number than it was pre-Kunark.... You know, in the first example it reduced the dps by 12.5, but in the second it reduced it by 25.  And it seems like a spell no group could do without.<P>Haste goes without saying.  Haste just helps to breach the gap between mobs and PCs.<P>Clarity, however, I feel is more important than it was.  While mana has always been super important, now the lack of it is more common, due to the toughness of the mobs and the higher mana requirements for killing said mobs.  Supply and demand, peoples.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  The demand for mana is greater now, though the supply is the same.  Hence, the enchanter is more important.<P>I am an enchanter, as I said, and I know that there is a million reasons why we are not "God-Like."  But, as I hope I've proved in my text, the problem is that while everyone else's skills and abilities have less of an impact on the mobs, our skills and abilities have MORE of an impact.  So much of an impact, that we are considered indespensable, and vital.  Rather than being a "nice addition" we are the front corner of the diamond, the heart of the group.<P>We are enchanters.  Who could have thought we would become so important, though we don't do any damage, nor do we take any.<P>Sweete Cherrypie<BR>47th Circle of Glamour <BR>Druzzil Ro<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

We also can't teleport.  <BR>Enchanters are NOT magicians.  Our pets suck to the point of going off the suck-o-meter.  We can't summon up all sorts of cool stuff.  Our damage shield spell is laughable at best.  As well, we can't do half the damage a magician can do with DD's.  <P>Enchanters are NOT necromancers.  The pet reply again.  Our DoT's are a joke compared to the major killing power of a necromancer.  We can't life tap our way back to full health.  Necros have a faster mana regen than enchanters.  (albeit at a cost of life to mana ratio)  We also can't feign death.  <P>Enchanter ARE enchanters.  We do crowd control and we do it well.  We debuff mobs: slow, lower MR, lower str/agi.  We charm, unpredictable to the point of hardly ever using it, but we do charm.  We do buffs and we do them well (clarity, haste, etc).  We have all sorts of useless illusions with the exception a few good ones for faction issues and practicality.  We also die more often than any other casting class IMHO.  We are a utility caster.  Enchanters are the swiss army knives of EverQuest.  <P>There you go.  The reason enchanters are what they are and do what they do.  They had to make each casting class unique from one another or the enchanter just wouldn't be the enchanter.  Try playing all 4 casting classes past a certain level and you'll understand they're uniqueness, strengths and weaknesses.     </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Uhm. Enchanters are overly necessary? What about tanks? How many groups can get along without a tank? Hmm? I can hardly solo blues. Usually come out of the battle with only a sliver of life left... if I come out at all. Ever tried a group without a tank? Doesn't work. I die more than I get XP.<BR>Sure, Enchanters are useful. At higher levels, they may be extremely sought after. But the fact of the matter remains: few groups can survive without a tank. Get a group with /three/ Enc, and if you don't have a tank, it doesn't mean diddly squat.<BR>So don't tell me that a group can't survive without an Enchanter. A group can most certainly survive with only a Cleric/Shaman/Druid/Ect.. to help buff, debuff, and mez. But without a tank? Not all that easy.<P>So think. Every class depends on every other class. Casters need tanks, tanks need casters. That is EVERQUEST. That is what Verant wants. And quite frankly, that's what I want. A balanced group to help me make it to the point that I /am/ sought after. Because I'll tell ya... I can't wait until I can shout Lvl ## Enchanter LFG and actually get some replies!

</FONT><HR>And once again, notice that increasing the power of tanks relative to mobs does NOT solve the problem. Enchanters remain in exactly the same rank with respect to power. If the tanks are doing double the damage, enchanter hastes are having double the effect. No matter how well a tank is tanking, crowd control prevents the exact same percentage of damage.<P>The problem with solving the 'problem' by making tanks 'powerful' again with respect to mobs is that the game gets trivialized. Sebilis should NOT be like Unrest where a very well tuned melee based group could take down the entire first floor of the mansion at once while it was still all blue.<P>The fact of the matter is that enchanters are not necessary because tanks are weaker, those effects are merely correlated. Both are the result of the fact that EVERQUEST IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE TRIVIALLY EASY!<P>Arlina</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am honestly sick to death of people saying enchanters are to powerful. In my opnion this roots from the fact that an enchanter, even at lvl 12, can defeat a noncaster in a duel even if they are 9 levels higher than them. So honestly i can see some pvp issues. My main is a reasonably high lvl shadow knight, and i paid every price you can think of leveling up my character. SK's are an absolute horror to play until lvl 30. And even then their still pretty undesireable in groups. I want everyone to think of the SK's they see on their server. You don't see 400 different ones every day whose names you can't keep track of. You see the same 8 or 9. That my friend, is an unbalanced class. But i always see people crying about how sk's act like this, or sk's act like that... well, if the few of us that actualy had the patince to play our character to lvl 30 and higher are a little biased, or rude sometimes, i'll tell you why. "/ooc XX sk LFG". This is commonly considered a joke, the only way we get groups is to either know the person running the group, or start them our selves. So you saying that a group cannot function without an enchanter is complete BS. Because i cannot recall more than a few times an enchanter has wanted to group with me, and i have lvl'd my character just fine, and i dont cry about it. SK's never get any kind of respect from ANY other classes untill we are higher lvl, and can finialy deal out some damage. Even then we cant really keep up with a warrior damage wise, but we can tank with the best of them. And your telling me i CANNOT tank without an enchanter?? HAHAHA this is far beyond insulting to me. My friend i, 80% of the time am tanking just fine without an enchanters buffs. I can honestly say that i am confident that in a duel, though i may not win, i could give an equal lvl enchanter a run for his money. <BR>I once saw a higher lvl warrior walk up to a low lvl druid, and DEMAND to be buffed. My bet is that this is the type of person the original poster is. I can understand why nobody would want to group with someone like that. <BR>You arguments that high lvl enchanters are good is fairly stupid as well, because if you look at the current thread being looked at by VI in reguards to class balancing Chanters, 90% of the complaints are, "I have nothing to do at 50+". <BR>So you are saying that YOU, who dosent even play an enchanter, knows more about their class then them? HA!<BR>I will admit, i have a mid lvl enchanter that i play around with sometimes, because in comparison to my SK, he is very easy, and relaxing to play, but honsetly, i could say this about any other character class in the game, possible exception being Rangers, because i have never played one of them, and from what i have been told, they are pretty difficult to play, although they do get SOW, so this increases their group value quite a bit. <BR>I really dont feel bad that enchanters are one of the "Group lifelines", after all, so are Clerics, but i dont hear anyone saying that someone should nerf their healing abilitys. But i am sure someone, somewhere feels this way...<BR>I am my own lifeline, if too many MOB's come i will Feign Death, If i need to go somewhere i will turn myself invisible, if i need to group i will handle it myself without whining about it. If you boubt my power, i will duel you, DOT you, take away your SOW, and then beat you senseless with my weapons. Does that mean that i am overpowered as well? Doubtful, but you seem to think that because you personaly NEED an enchanters buffs to survive, because you alone lack the ability to play your own class effectivley, the entire class should be nerfed. On your whim right? fool.. I would bet your main is a Paladin!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Not that I think it'll be worth much to mention it... as Twipple and those who support him seem very staunch in their insistance that Enchanters are overpowered, buuut...<P>Enchanters are very integral to a group, but by the same token, the group is integral to its Enchanter.  Even the best Enchanter will die horribly if their group doesn't work well together.  I have seen many raids go horribly wrong, with mutiple Enchanters involved... why?  The Enchanters did their best, but sometimes there was a bad pull, or too many resists, or warriors/casters not assisting one person and breaking mezzes.  I've watched Enchanters literally collapse in seconds before the stampede of mob that resisted, or spawned unexpectedly, or was "tagged unmmezzable", or even felt taunted by the substandard Enchanter blast.  Believe it or not, the Enchanter's tiny blast is enough to taunt a level 60 mob with 15 tanks and multiple casters on it into summoning and killing that Enchanter.  I've seen it many times, and even experienced it repeatedly.<P>The Enchanter has a great deal of potential, with a magnificent array of spells.. yet, they depend heavily upon their group to KILL THE MOBS.  Even the best Enchanter will fall if they're in a bad group.  What does this mean?  It means that all parts are important.  Tanks are needed to keep mobs off the casters, and to deal constant damage.  Casters bring to the group spells and pets.  Healers provide a way to keep their group going as the damage piles up.<P>It just doesn't seem right to say that one class needs "nerfing" because they're important to a group.  All classes have importance, saying that Enchanters are too integral is like saying a Cleric is too integral, or a Warrior.  These classes pay dearly for their abilities, and they pay for it in difficulty of play, difficulty in levelling, and a distinct need for grouping.  You won't find too many solo clerics or enchanters out there.. it's doable, but extremely dangerous.<P>Also, I'm of the opinion that highly resistant mobs is equivellent to mobs having a lot of hitpoints.  High resists make the Enchanter's job just as difficult as a lot of hitpoints does for warriors.<P>Don't think I've really said much that was new, but I do feel it's very odd to see someone yelling about the power Enchanters... a class I've always felt needed improvement to truly be as they were intended.<P>- Wafuru</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Twipple-<P>/APPLAUD<P>Can't understand how anyone can deny the truth in your statements/arguements.  Enchanters (even clerics to some degree) have the world of Norrath in the palm of their hand.  Having trouble finding a group is laughable.  Especially compared to the great difficulty the generally uneeded hybrid classes have. They are the cornerstone of groups 50+ (i would even say it becomes evident starting as low as 40+ now with velious and kunark).<BR>These problems EXSIST and all the while, Verant Interactive claims that the game is closer than ever to being 'balanced'..  You are absolutely right.  Tanks cannot TANK anymore..  If you have been reading any other threads you would find a lot of melee type classes are crying out in pain about the current state of their viability in a group.  They want the caps raised, they want greater HP and AC bonuses, they want to FEEL WANTED again..  <BR>Whatever the case, Verant SERIOUSLY needs to investigate these issues.  A group shouldn't be dependant on an enchanter, they should certainly be a welcome addition, as all classes should, no more, no less.  This seems to be more along the lines of 'balance', in my humble opinion.<P>Vinere - Druzzil Ro<BR>(former Ranger turned Necromancer)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> Hi everyone.<BR>  ok.. tanks not being able to tank as well as they used to.. can't say i agree or dis-agree, considering I have been playing for 5 months.<P> tanks can't kill blues? Hmm. if your talking blue cons.. I dis-agree, my ranger and my monk both kill blues just fine, and for that matter, so does my enchanter, but my MAGICIAN kills YELLOWS just fine  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR> tho my Mage was my last character made, and stats/race were best suited for the class.<P> I don't agree with the title of this thread, I wish we had a "plague of enchanters' because everyone would be buffed, and the enchanters could go around solo (tho they wouldn't have anything to kill due to every tank being buffed)<P> I will keep this tread in mind when I have a tank class and my enchanter both post 50, and try to decide which one i can get more glory in playing.. give me 3 years for the enchanter, I'm learning  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P> Caeinie (torv.)<BR> Radula (same)<BR> Baeeleb (same)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>To start this off, yes I play a chanter....<P>Why do I have to wait for a warrior or other well played melee type to form a group and then I have to wait for a cleric????<P>This seems to me to be completely wrong, Why can't I sub a warrior for a Necro and a Cleric for a Ranger??<P>It is incredibly unfair that I have to group to be able to do anything and then I have to wait for a good group so I don't die!!!!!<P>Warrior are the most over powered class in the game, nothing happens with out a warrior around!!!<P>NERF Warriors!!!!<P>/sarcasm off....<P>hhmmm... Poorly written but then so are most whines/complaints.<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>i thought there were rules about class envy post.  this guy has some real personal issues, or is a troll.  maybe both.  asking verant to take the need for crowd control away by making tanks able to handle 3 mobs (which basically is all his post is about) goes beyond class envy into stupidity.  as an enchanter i dont ask for the hp of a warrior, please dont ask for my primary group contribution either.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000604-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000604.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000604-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000604-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000604&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000604&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
