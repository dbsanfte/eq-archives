</FONT><HR>For all I care, you can remove the Cobalt Armor from the game since it is nigh impossible to get and the spells cast by it seems to give you fits.  There are only two spells from that armor that are useful to warriors anyway - shrink and invis.<P>Along with the idea about raising skill caps on parry, riposte, dodge, piercing, et. al. in the above post.  I would also like to see the warrior Berserk ability enhanced so that as you go up in levels, the effect of berserk becomes more than just a few more points of strength and a possible crippling blow.<P>First - increase the amount of Str a berserk character gets based on level.<P>Second - Decrease the amount of damage a berserk character is taking per hit - being berserk you just aren't feeling the pain.  Not sure what a good formula would be, but to start with try reducing damage at (level/2)%  Level 60 berserk drops incoming damage by 30%, Level 10 by 5%, etc.<P>Third - Give the berserk character a degree of built in haste as the adrenalin of being near death kicks in.<P>Fourth - Make a crippling blow really devistating.  Have it stun the mob.  Have multiple crippling blows slow down the mob's attack speed.  Add a dot for internal bleeding.  Respect the crippling blow!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I play a warrior as main and most of these posts are ridiculous.  A "return to home" button...that's ludicrous.  Come on, at least ask for stuff that is reasonable.  I want stuff fixed on the warrior before I am going to go asking to get all these extras.  AE taunt is nice but will never happen.  Fix the recycle on the taunt and make it work better.  Everything else seems fine.  We're supposed to be dependent on others like they are on us for our HP.  It's too late in the game for most of these sweeping changes you guys are trying for.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think NoamuChath kind of missed what I was trying to get at( mostly cus I was pissed off when typing that out before & didn't go in to ever as well as I should of). I never said that hybrids are asking to as good as a tank as a warrior, what I was saying is that VI with there vision(which I guess more then 5 people are having, which makes for a bad one) say hey lets just make pallys/sk as good a tanking class as warrior. pre 50 there is no prb of warriors vs. the hybrids, cus ever thing is balanced nice.It's after 52 that there is the gap that ever one is talking about(starts at 46 really but not till 52 is it really there & you can see it),I would like to see hybrids to get high skill caps in defensive to help with tanking  the boss mobs or just group play to. But to make the skills the same as warriors is worng I feel. I like I keep saying make them 80% warrior(means 80% of my skill caps, hp plus a few of the dis I get post 50 & a few of there own) & then make them 40% of the casting class they are based off of(means 40% of there spells plus some of there own spells & skills that no other class has). to blance that power(your now 120% of a class) have that -xp set at 20% with out your race add in. This is fair to all. Warriors are still the best tanks by 20% & hybrids would find that they get new skills & spells to use on thous uber boss mobs & they are a better tank to.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hey, going to mention a couple things that I stated two threads ago.  Trying to get them noticed by Absor in this mess of posts before he wraps up the discussion.<P><BR>Critical Hits:<P>Their frequency only changes with increases to dexterity, and that's fairly marginal from what I can tell. Rather than changing the minimum dmg (which admittadly would be nice, but I don't see it happening), increase the frequency that we get crits as we get higher level. Don't make it a clickable button, it dosen't need that level of reworking.<P><BR>Warrior Epic Weapon:<P>Increase the frequency of the drops for it. We have some seriously bad mobs to go after, and there's alot of us trying for these items. (In the case of the red dragonscale, bards also need this). *PLEASE* make them a constant drop from their respective critters.<BR>The weapon itself is nice, but the majority of tank weapons add haste while ours dosen't? *boggle*<BR>Also, make the scabbard some kind of reward in itself. (Maybe add the haste efect to the scabbard rather than the sword?) Have it increase some stats, with a focus on AC and protection, and make it a back slot item. (It's worn on the back of the NPC in Freeport, if I recall correctly, so why not?) At the very least, a weightless container.<P>Equip a 2 handed sword with a shield at high levels:<P>Now THIS is an interesting idea. Woiuld take some work to make it work good without overbalancing, but it would be a KILLER ability completely unique to warriors, and make shields useful to us again. (When was the last time you saw a warrior who used a shield, other than for special case functions like resists or click-procs?) And the Uni Shield dosen't count, it's really a piercing weapon with an AC bonus. =-)<P>Replace the invisibility efect on the Cobalt pants with:<P>Effect: Summon Redhaired Female Woodelf. =-)<P><BR>Razorback Levinphyre<BR>Officer of the Knights of the Arcane<BR>Bristlebane<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>     I have visited these threads since part 1 started. There has been many well thought out, and all around great posts concerning the problems that Warriors have to deal with on a day today basis. These problems, ranging from taunt to offensive and defensive skills, have been addressed enough to get the point across that some things do need to be changed. Since your last and only reply Absor, I have given serious thought as to why I should still play a Warrior if these upgrades from the Test server go live.<P>     I have played a Warrior and a Paladin both to 52, and I have noticed major problems with each of them. Now, don't get me wrong here, I am really glad that the problems of the hybrid classes are being addressed and taken care of. It is good to know that there will be other tanks to fall back on when all else fails and I have 1/4 of a bubble of health. <P>     Now, correct me if I'm wrong on this one. A hybrid is a mix of two classes. One being the parent class, and the other being basically the utility class. When one so chooses to become a hybrid, whether it is one made for pure offense or pure defense, they're giving up a partial ability to take damage like a Warrior for the gift of spellcasting of the given utility class. Also, for the ability of taking and dealing melee damage like a warrior, they give up a partial amount of spellcasting potential like a pure caster. When hybrids were given the same mana as a pure caster, I was overjoyed. That made hybrids that didn't have good gear just as good in a pick up group. When the hybrid exp penalties were taken away, I was happy about this upgrade too. In some aspects, and penalty for using parts of 2 classes is understandable, but I was glad see it go. That was a very good choice. <P>     When the first part of the Warrior Talk opened up, it was good to know that there were alot of people out there that had the same concerns that I have about the problems that sometimes plague any given Warrior. But as for the any given Warrior thing, I'll get back to that.<P>     Taunt, of course, is the main problem that most of us have in common. I for one, can't even begin to describe how troublesome the Taunt ability can be at times. Having a caster almost die due to the fact that I can't taunt off of him makes a good day go bad for alot of folks. There has been countless posts about this. Taunt needs to at least be looked into. <P>     The levels 36-51 are by far the most agonizing times of a Warriors career. Having no other abilities through these levels will cause alot of people to give up playing a good class. My purpose for even exsisting on Norrath is to tank, yet the only thing I get to do is play with the disarm button. You see what I'm getting at? Let me explain this a little better. Paladins get Lay Hands. Since they are clerical crusaders always "Protecting" there fellow man regardless of that mans stature. The Lay Hands ability reflects this in all aspects. Lay Hands is more of a defensive ability, much like the user of it, the Paladin. Paladins protect, therefore they buff, and heal. What I'm trying to say is, shouldn't Warriors get an ability at gives them a brief but significant boost in AC with a horrific downtime just like Lay Hands? My job is to tank, no more no less, just tank. The AE taunt would be a very nice addition also.<P>     AC/HP is another problem that I just can't look past. Please remember this one thing. Not every Warrior on this game has gear like Furor, and not every Warrior on this game is a Large Race. Not every Warrior has the luxury of going to an Uber mob raid every day or every weekend for that matter.<P>     When the class Epic Weapon Quests first came out, I couldn't even begin to describe how much life that pumped back into my fading joy of playing a Warrior. The constant press Attack, Kick, Taunt, Disarm, Taunt, Kick routine got very old around level 37. Once the first Jagged Blade of War of found, I did as much research as possible through sites and friends on EQ. To my shock, I came to realize that the actual Quest itself was indeed "Epic". But, the two 1 hand slash weapons weren't so "Epic". This problem has been addressed alot. Please look into it.<P>     For my final concern, even though there are many more I am forgetting, please remember that Warriors are the most equipment dependent class on the game. I am 52 and I only have 2 pieces of Cobalt and 1 piece of Indo armor and the rest is crafted armor. And I have seen Warriors much higher level than that running around in full crafted. I have had the full set of Crafted armor since level 28. Humor me and tell me that its normal for every other class to keep the same exact pieces of armor for 24 levels.<P>     These concerns and many others have been posted 5 threads long now, and only one reply. I will not comment on your speed and willingness to attend to these needs that we think are very important, but please do try to listen to what the players have to say. Once again, I'd like to say it's good to see hybrids are getting better upgrades, but a line has to be drawn somewhere. Defense is all that defined a Warrior and the one and only true meatshield, but now I guess those days are gone.<P>     </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Issues with the Warrior epic 2-hander:<P>The proc, Rage of Zek, does 2 things:<P>1) 175pt fire based dd<BR>2) approx 12 AC debuff, lasting 3 minutes or so<P>The problems we're seeing are stacking difficulties in the following situations:<P>a) If two warriors with epics are fighting the same mob, and one warrior procs, the second warrior to proc will get a 'Your spell did not take hold message'.  The first warrior will land successful procs on the mob, but the second will not be able to proc while the 'Zek' debuff is present.<P>b) The Shaman spell Cripple seems to block procs in the same way.<P>I'm sure the reason the procs don't stack is due to the AC debuff part of the proc.  This is understandable, but it also procs the 175pt dd, which I don't think was intended.  So in situation 'a', every resisted proc the second warrior has costs the group 175pts in potential damage.  And in situation 'b', the single warrior will have all procs nullified.<P>I imagine that having partial stacking will be nearly impossible due to the coding, but I think most warriors with epics would agree that the 175pt dd is far more important than the 12 AC debuff.  I'd really like to see the proc changed to address this.  There's no need for warriors' epic DD's to be blocked due to a spell stacking issue.<P>I like how the proc is a unique spell, and simply removing the AC buff would remove that.  How about replacing the AC debuff with something that buffs the warrior instead?  Maybe adding 12 AC to the warrior, or a 200pt Rune, or a stackable haste.  Anything would be better than current, as long as the proc has no stacking issues with any current buffs or debuffs.<P>I'm hearing that the 1HS weapons have a similar stacking issue, but I have not been able to test it as of yet.  If this is the case, then the above arguments would cover the 1HS as well.  Maybe a Haste proc on the 1HS would be a good solution, considering the need to speed those weapons up.<P>There are a lot of ways to fix this, but please, whatever is decided, make it stackable  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Coffinn Unforgiven<BR>lvl 59 Dark Elf Warrior<BR>Sol Invictus<BR>Tribunal<P>Bombastic P.

</FONT><HR>Coffinn_Unforgiven:<BR>Your not entierly correct on the stacking bug.<BR>The problem occurs if someone Procing Rage of Vallon before Rage of Zek, the spell will not take hold. Or if someone Procing Rage of Zek before Rage of Vallon.<P>This means 2 warriors cannot use the 1h and 2h on same mob without having one proc block the other out. they can both use the 1h or the 2h without any problems. but not both.<P>ex: Warrior1 had the 1h epic equipped, Warrior2 is using the 2h epic.<P>Warrior1 procs Rage of Vallon. Warrior2's Rage of Zek spell will not take hold. OR. Warrior 2 proc Rage of Zek, warrior1's rage of Vallon will not take hold. <BR>Warrior2 switches to the 1h epic:<BR>Warrior1 procs Rage of Vallon. Warrior2's Rage of Vallon spell will now take hold on the mob. and work as intended.

</FONT><HR>Quick points on Warrior issues.<P>#1 KEEP DISARM<BR>No reason to remove this at all.  Those of us on PvP servers use this often and is very important to us.  Those that do not like to use it are not forced to use this any more than I am forced to use my throwing skill.  My greatest fear is that players who have taken the time and effort to build a skill will have an poorly reasoned decision made to neuter them for no reason.<BR>Leave it alone.<P>#2 Bind Wounds<BR>This is not a solo vs party issue.  IMHO lowering the Bind Wound increase from 50 down to 40 would help reduce the tedium without a significant Game balance change. On a PvP server this helps the warrior who when jumped and damaged has very few options compared to other classes.<P>#3 Taunt<BR>It would be nice to improve this skill.  The whole point of our class is to be able to have the ability to provide protection for our party "Verant make it so".<P>#4 Pierce 250 not 240<BR>Warriors have a few warrior only daggers and the ability to use many fine pierces.  It is not unbalancing to allow warriors to have full use of their options.<P>#5 Archery / Fletching<BR>Whatever changes you make to the basic skills and abilities (not disciplines), do not make warriors 2nd class.  My greatest fear is that players who have taken the time and effort to build a skill will have an poorly reasoned decision made to neuter them for no reason.  Allow the "Balance" in the skill and craft that exists today to be maintained.<P>#6 Cobalt<BR>This drop rate is too low.  It is currently silly compared to other classes simallar items.  In addition, many new items are appearing in expansions that drop more consistantly that are arguably better.  Please improve this drop rate.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>  With the utility spells and buffs that hybrids get they are already more powerful than warriors 1 on 1.  You want to test the balance of the classes consider a duel. With stuns,heals,thorns,fear and all the other abilities of a hybrid warriors dont even come close. Now Verant wants to give away our edge on Defense and offense to. /sigh<BR>Warriors NEED 3 things as i see it. <BR>1.  bind wound the same as a monk. We are the only mellee class that cant heal past 50%. Why?? Because we have a little higher offense and defense skill? Makes no sense at all. Warriors should be right there with monks in the ability to bandage themselves after all who has to bind their wounds the most?<BR>2. Critical hits. What is critical about a hit that does 3 damage?!?!?! This makes no sense at all. The critical hit should be a minimum of the max normal damage of the weapon used. If it is not going to be this way you never should have named it a critical hit. You should should have considered a name like "a little different scrape that time".<BR>3. Berserken Taunt. 3 minute reuse time. Deals a critical hit to all mobs in the immediate area and taunts them start it at lvl 35 in place of disarm. What was the purpose of Disarm anyway?!?! Its a joke.<BR>Since VI sees it necessary to give away the offesive/defensive edge of a warrior to classes that all ready have way more abilities I feel that these are not at all out of line. Without these improvements we will see a decline in the number of new warriors. Why play a warrior when a ranger can dish as much (actually alot more) or more damage, a pally and SK can take hits just as well, and they can all heal themselves or buy time for themselves to escape a bad situation. Because we get high offense and defense? Changes need to be made. I feel like warriors are being totally overlooked and we have some real concerns. I think what i have asked would be a staple want for all Warriors. Please consider it carefully.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree with mostly what others say. On the subject of what the higher level warriors (58-60) argue about: IE Fixing epic drops/usefulness...well that makes it seem a little selfish if you ask me. I understand how they might not feel useful but if the only three things you fix is that dealing with the 55+ game you are severely frustrating the rest of us. Playing a lower level warrior is just the same as playing a higher level one. When I was level 35 I spent weeks trying to find groups and was seeing bards/rangers in place of groups I could of joined. Maybe this is the ignorant of the lower level characters but I beg to differ. People want those fast escape spells, heals, etc..<P>We just aren't useful anymore.<P>Thanks for taking away the EXP penalty for all hybrids. They are happy. Thanks for increasing their defensive/offensive skill. Thanks for giving them helpful spells and a great way to taunt. Thanks for making them better.<P>Why are rogues arguing over this evade thing? They don't see the severity of the situation warriors are in I guess. <P>ALL the arguements going on right now are focused on the rogues and rangers. Do these guys NEVER stop arguing with Verant? I remember when rogues were holding petitions to get fixed and now they are the #1 damage dealer next to a monk and they want to continue this trend but with a higher evade. Oh well, this isn't about rogues. Here's a few things that I think should be fixed.<P>Personally, adding new skills might seem a bit unbalacing. Like the AE taunt and all that stuff. Would it really be that harder to give us a 255'ish cap on all abilities. Warriors are supposed to take the most damage and we have no escape in the first place. We get to berserk, we're most likely going to die. If something is on the healer you have no chance but to try to run. Almost ANY other class in this game can get out of a bad situation. Paladins got LOH. Necros got HT (not the most useful but hey it's there). Bards got Selo. Rangers got SoW, so do druids and shamans. But while everyone else is running away, evaccing what do we do? We're rooted/stunned while the rest of the group is in the other room casting evac.<P>Maybe this is a completely hypothetical situation and most people haven't had this big of a problem. But the truth is we have NO way out. We are supposed to take damage and be the meat shield if you will. But when it comes time for a bad pull or something, we're left out in the cold. I just wanted Verant to know how that feels.<P>Some fixes I think that should change:<P>Increase OUR skills to maybe 5 points higher. <P>For one, have you ever seen a warrior out damage a monk or rogue? Or a necro/mage pet? Possible, but only if your equipment is light years ahead of theirs.<P>We still wouldn't do the most damage but we'd have a little edge and maybe for once be able to keep a monster on us. Taunt is a joke, even a bard can taunt off better than a warrior sometimes. Now with rangers new skills they will always have the creatures on them.<P>God, the more I think of it what ever happened to warriors? Everyone plays one, does that make you think that we are balanced? <P>WE SHOULD be the masters of MELEE, the takers of damage and the ones who keep the mobs off the casters. We shouldn't be attacking, taunting, attacking, taunting ... while the monster is beating on the cleric who's healing the ranger. Once the cleric says "OOM" and the ranger snares and backs off, what do we do? Monster comes for us while everyone just sits there and watches you tank ... and then die.<P>Most people would disagree, but that's because you are most likely in a 'uber' guild, well not everyone is. Don't fix this game for UBER guilds, fix it for everyone. <P>Fix the epics, increase our skills, make taunt more useful, DON'T TAKE AWAY to make us better. The spells on the armor make us 1000 times more useful. Do you know what it's like going into everyzone asking for SoW because the last 5 ancient cyclops you've killed got ninja'ed? It's horrible.<P>I hate being a warrior. I love being a warrior.<P>Give us more, not less. That's all i'm saying. Do what you need to make us happy. Don't make us mad. We're already mad. We've been mad for months. You're making everything better. I'm rambling. It doesn't matter. Someone has to make a point. We want more, NOT LESS.<P>I'm only a myrmidon right now but when i'm a warlord I want to be better than a FRICKIN ranger. Remember when they were a joke?<P>Warriors: Haha, stupid ranger.<P>now<P>Rangers: Haha, stupid warriors.<BR>Mages: Haha, stupid warriors.<BR>Paladins: Haha, stupid warriors.<BR>Necros: Haha, stupid warriors.<BR>Bards: Haha, stupid warriors.<BR>Rogues: Haha, stupid warriors.<BR>Shadow Knights: Haha, stupid warriors.<BR>Wizards: Haha, stupid warriors.<BR>Cleric: Haha, stupid warriors.

Even mages (I am a primary mage) who are just about the best made and thought out class in the game are out there whining about needing a root spell or whatever today's flavor is.<P>The necros, who are widely acknowledged to be just about the cheesiest class in the game, even they have gripes.<P>Hell, even the druids gripe about being underpowered or whatnot.<P>Class balance is never going to happen. The high level game is the problem. It needs to be tweaked to be more FORGIVING. When the common perception is that only 3 classes are necessary, the problem isn't the classes, the problem is the high level game.<P>If a Paladin can out taunt a Warrior with spells, the problem isn't the Paladin, the problem is taunt.<P>If the 50+ mobs hit so hard that the only acceptable tank is a Warrior, and the only acceptable healer is the Cleric, then the problem is the 50+ mobs.<P>If in the 50+ game, crowd control is an absolute necessity, then you have a dungeon design/pathing problem. If I plink a mob with an arrow, and he goes running 100 feet in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION, only to turn around and bring 5 friends with him, then isn't *THAT* the problem?<P>If a dungeon is designed in such a way that there is ONE SINGLE PATH from the most distant "room" (the Guk example would be something like LORD) to the exit, then that creates a very obvious TRAIN ISSUE.<P>If ONE room trains out, they will be training everyone between that room and the EXIT.<P>So basically I am saying that the problem is NOT class balance, the problem is that the high level game is just so unforgiving that the only classes that will do are the cleric, warrior and enchanter. That's just wrong. I would imagine everyone else wants to play too.<P>The one class I truly feel sorry for is the Wizards. I do not play one so I am not biased, but they just do not bring enough to the table to be worth having. I'm sorry, DD and evac doesn't cut it, even the most powerful DD in the game means bupkiss because the high level game is about MELEE DAMAGE.<P>Melee damage is efficient (it's free!.) Augment the melee people and you have a slicing dicing mob cuisinart.<P>Even a spell like Ice Comet which is one of the best DD's in the game can't compete. If you have just 2 tanks with Augmentation, they will outdamage Ice Comet in like 2 rounds, and they dont need to med. A good round with 1 backstab and 1 critical will outdamage that 1000 point DD.<P>THAT is what the high level game is all about. Efficiency. DD is nice in the low level game. You can kill mobs faster with it than without it.<P>But what good is a DD when the tanks are doing more damage in like 2 rounds? And they don't stop. They don't med. They just keep pumping out the damage, mob after mob after mob.<P>And that's basically why the trio of Warrior, Enchie, Cleric is pretty much unbeatable in the late game.<P>Fizzle.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sorry for double post but after re reading the info I posted I found it needed a spell check bad and I added a few lines as well. so please disregard the post above. <P>I've read a big chunk of post I think this is new info... <BR>PRE LEVEL 50<BR>Just so you know I am in strong believe that all classes pre 50 are as balanced as they ever will be (I have played every class to at least level 15 most 30-40+ my main is 53 warrior I also got 44 monk 46 pally 35 druid 32 wizzie...) including warriors, and I think changing anything there would not be advisable, with new improved equipment from expansions warriors that use it pre 50+, and there are tons of those, are actually overpowered by a long shot, but since that armor goes to lower level characters it means its not available to those of us higher level and actually desperately needing it to tank those mobs who hit 140+.<BR>Once again I will say big problem with warrior class is its popularity and because of the fact the class is so equipment based higher level characters of other classes love to get good equipment (by rolling on stuff they can't use etc...) and make a warrior who will make it to 50 in less then 4 days played which hinders the whole warrior community. Since those of us who still have patience to play warriors as out primary characters and not in ubber guilds are left hanging dry in the cold with very little chance of getting anything while hunting in appropriate for our level places. Unless we are willing to spend out lives in East Commons doing trades for better equipment (I for one do not consider that fun and never do it. Yes I play games for fun and will not be forced to do something I do not enjoy.) This is only an issue with armor after release of the expansions there are plenty great weapons to go around for everyone, we for sure not there to do insane damage its nice if you but definitely not necessary, but since warrior armor MUST BE BEST (at least that's what "Vision TM has been saying since very beginning) there are very little pieces available for a huge warrior community and makes it pretty much impossible to play. I believe it has been mentioned numerous times all about our armor but I can post it again:<P>well there are 5 sets of armor that are out there for 50+ warriors<P>1. Indicolite <BR>- all : no drop comes of mummies in hate random semi rare drop ( whenever I am up there are at least 5 other warriors trying to get some of this while there is only 1-2 of shadowknights and rogues. Its easy to say that those 2 classes get all of their planar armor first making their ac at least that of mine in crafted)<P>2. Cobalt <BR>Karnors<BR>- Gloves : off Dolgvart Captain <BR>- Greaves : off Velnir Sathir<BR>- Boots : off Caller of Sathir<BR>Sebilis<BR>- BP : off Trakanon<BR>- Helm : off Froglok Reet Knight semi rare drop<BR>- Bracers : off mushrooms rare drop<BR>(All of Cobalt is very rare drop I've been trying to get Gloves for 1 month to no avail and whenever I do get group going everyone want to make loot free for all so even if the did drop chances are they would not go to me. By the way thanks to wonderful faction system I am now KoS in Otherver and I am a troll)<P>3. Beserserker's<BR>- all :  no drop in Plane of Growth<BR>(no idea never been there yet and doubt will be able to go since I am in small guild with only 1-2 groups of 50+)<P>4. Champion's<BR>- all : quests in Thurgain<BR>like Sleeves : Captain Njall promises to make some Vambraces for you if you give him 3 flawed emeralds(off wyvern in coblat scar) and some corroded plate vambraces ( no clue how doable this is but I hear that stuff only drops off high level mobs in very tough zones once again probably never gonna get any of that)<P>5. not sure<BR>- all :  quests in Kael Drakkal <BR>like Helm: Kragek promises to make a helm for you if you bring him an ancient tarnished plate helmet and three crushed coral pieces ( no clue how doable this is but I hear that stuff only drops off high level mobs in very tough zones once again probably never going to get any of that)<P>So please tell me how am I suppose to equip myself? I am definitely out of ideas. So for now I am stuck in Crafted Armor which I have had since it came out about a year and a half ago and that's at level 53 I have 1 piece of my planar armor and I assure you that most of Rogues, Shadowknights, Paladins, Rangers have much more then that making their AC actually higher then mine and add to them that they either out damage me or have a lot of utility spells to choose from to taunt and they actually make better tanks then me till I can get some armor and I know that most my warrior friends are in same type of situation. The only think I do still have in my advantage are the hps but then mobs start hitting for 140+ through my low ac that just a few more seconds if that till the time cleric must cast her complete healing on me since that's the only spell that can heal my ton of god damn hps, so not only that I must be in group that has cleric at all time since no other class can heal me as fast as I am being hit.<P><BR>TAUNT - new idea<BR>Increase TAUNT SKILL past 50 and not being able to taunt anything that does not con blue to me is ridiculous too since there is no way I can only be hunting in the place that has just con blue mobs to me, how am I expected to know what is around the corner, I understand your desire to make boss encounters harder but this is effecting my day to day life and making it hell.

</FONT><HR>Warriors are supposed to be the masters of war, and all weapons and skills relating to War. Why does our piercing cap lower than our other weapon skills, Just to make rogues happy, wth is up with that? I dont mind you helpin the hybrids out, an fixin em up some, they need it, but c'mon, you give Rangers more offense? wth are you thinking? Rangers die, all the time, becuase the do too much damage an they piss things off, and since Taunt is pathetic(which btw I think needs a boost Bring taunt up to 250! damnit!) if you wanna help Rangers, Give them the same defense as a paladin has offense..I dont mind fixes to other classes, but giving SKs/Paladins same defense cap as a Warrior is messed up imo, you wanna raise their defense, thats fine with me but raise ours too its  We are one of the Parent classes to the hybrids they shouldnt be as good as us in melee/tanking situations and how Warriors are supposed to have so much more hp, thats bs we dont have that Much more hp than a paladin or SK, another thing that you need to consider if you wanna help Rangers, give them a little more hp..Warriors were fine imo untill the recent changes yer lookin into makin, up till just recently, my only real complaints would be Taunt, make it better, and the epics, the  War FA needs a little work, I dont want anythin drastic, but it needs a little touchin up, maybe make the 1hs 14/22, and as for the 2hI cant recommend a good change for it cus it doesnt matter too much to me ..ok I'm done ranting..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There are a couple of reoccurring themes here.  I'll try and touch on a couple here.<P>1. Taunt.  This skill needs to work better than it currently does.  I don't even always aggro a mob when I walk up to it and taunt it.  Right now warriors rely on fast delay weapons to keep the creature engaged, and hope the taunt button works once in awhile.<BR>2. 2 Handed weapons.  We don't use these primarily, and mostly for the reason above.  No matter how attractive the damage is, the inability to taunt will keep us from using them when we have to be tank in the group.  <BR>3. Cobalt armor.  Gauntlet and boot effects do not stack, and no one uses the gauntlet effect regularly.  Could the effect on them be changed to a low level agi, dex, or stm spell?  Also the cobalt bracer is an incredibly rare drop.  It is one of the better pieces, but I may hear of one dropping every couple of weeks, when the mobs that drop them are cleared on a daily basis.  <BR>4. Piercing.  Why is this capped at 240?   <BR>5. Epic weapon.  I'm sure the both the damage and delay could be lowered on it while keeping the same overall damage output.  Make the offensive proc override itself, so it will stick when 2 warriors with the epics attack the same mob.  Change the other proc to an effect similar to the haste effect on the ranger and rogue epics.  I'm sure we won't miss the current effect, and it will open up more diverse equipment choices then having to equip some sort of haste item.<P><BR>Lugor<BR>58 Warrior of Lotus Cult<BR>Quellious <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I believe that, overall, the warrior class does not need many changes.  These are just the 2 changes i would do to the warriors after 56 levels of playing one:<P>-Refresh disciplines so that they are restarted after dying.<BR>Absor, can you please explain to me why LoH and HT refresh when paladins/SKs die, but disciplines do not?  They both act as a special effect on a determined period of time.  Why did verant decide to not apply the same principles to disciplines?<P>-Adjust 2hs/2hb to increase their taunt factor to make 2-handed weapons viable.<BR>Over and over again we see that dual weilding beats out two handed weapons.  Any set of 2 weapons beats out a 2h weapon of similar difficulty to obtain or even higher.  Even though it would be great, im not asking for warriors to do more damage, im asking for warriors to be able to out-taunt other people (which similar equipment in terms of difficulty to obtain) while using a 2h weapon, which currently does not happen.  Adjust the taunt factor on 2h weapons!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Personally, as a warrior I have noticed a few things.<P>1. Almost ALL of my friends who are higher lvl warriors, don't like it anymore and play alts (clerics/chanters). High level warriors come a dime a dozen...therefor not a huge demand for them as you can get one from anywhere. <P>2. I have seen many times where a warrior wasn't added because they want a monk more...even as a main tank. Yes I know quite a few people that would rather have a full set of monks as thier tanks since they do more damage.<P>My question, aren't warriors supposed to be the ULTIMATE melee damage dealer? I belive they should be. I think warriors should be able to hit harder than they do and get hit less often. I know our gear helps that vs. a monks but we still get hit A LOT. Why do most other if not all classes get thier Defence skill raised on the test to possibly go live? Why don't warriors get a higher cap then? Should a cleric be able to defend as good as a warrior? HECK NO!<BR> <BR>People say warriors are balanced, in a way yes we are, there's not a whole lot to balance. Only problem I have, is that we don't live up to the name Warrior. We shouldn't be out damaged by anyone, and yes I even mean monks and rogues. I know we are known as the "meat shield" when we are in a group, but we should be known for our massive damage than just a meat shield.<P>My wish, if your going to move the other class's defence cap up, move warriors higher too. Also, give us something to make us the Ultimate melee, better than monks...we can't heal, can't Feign Death, nothing....at higher lvls we get disc's but they don't make a group if ya ask me. <BR>*shrug*<BR>/bow /bye<P>a_router_problem_00</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>if you let warriors specialize in a weapon type and NOT LET ANY OTHER CLASS DO THE SAME the warrior class would be so much more desireable. raise the cap by 30-50 points. or why play a warrior when you can play a warrior that can cast? the hybrids are not warriors so quit crying about not bieng able to tank like one.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>For the most part Warriors are ok as they are. as for the idea of that AoE taunt that would be pretty cool. but if my group gets trained in the Royaly room in chardok and like a dozen mobs come, if you think im going to use that our out of your mind. if they make the taunt for warriors to high then whats the point of other melee classes even bothering getting armor since warriors will be able to taunt everything off of anyone. a good idea would be to increase our taunt alot so we can taunt pretty much anything off of anyone, BUT make the taunts refresh time longer. or just increase it slightly. I dont have that much dificulty in taunting a angry mob off of anyone even with my trudgeon of doom 2h blunt. I dont have to taunt 20 times before attacking a mob either. but yeah taunt could be twinked slightly. oh and whats up with the soft ac cap of 1100?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
