</FONT><HR>Well a great many of my bardic brethren (say that three times fast. That that that. Very funny) have brought up just about all my concerns, so I won't give a huge list or anything. But I will point out that I agree with almost everything said here (though the one guy freaking out about practicing instrument skills was a little off base)<P>Anyway, I'd like to see at least a downtime Twisting macro. I dunno about other Bards, but when I play for a few hours, I will sometimes hurt physically from all the twisting I have had to do. Now I'm not saying we should be able to use a macro like this during battle, but a downtime/travelling macro would be very helpful.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree with the former posts and I like to add some things too.<P>Make cantana (lvl 55 mana song) stack with other regen spells and mana spells. It's so annoying to hear: -turn off mana song! Every 10th minute.<P>Take away the lvl cap or raise them on fear-charm-Song of Twilight. If I'm the CC in a group I can't do anything if a 55+ mob comes... not even try to stun.<P>Take away the dmg from our lvl 60 slow/dot and upper the slow effect. If I slow a mob, to help the enchanter before his slow goes in, and we get adds we have a problem. I cant understand why our lvl 60 slow is 31%... please check that.... and it does NOT get better with an instrument "like all the other songs for that matter".<P>Still problems with charmed mobs attacking my group members... even group members pets attacking me  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P>Having instrument/epic to be required using SoV songs was a bad idea... I have had my SoV songs since a few weeks after SoV came and I memed them once. Hmm, not the 60 song, I haven't even scribed it.<P>I know that you dont want posts about Epic but I must say that it's a bad idea to have quest parts that everyone needs for other stuff like red and white dragon scale.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well put, fellow Bards. There seems to be an abundant amount of cogent analysis here. This thread will certainly be a far cry from the "We're pretty much Ok, just give us a little more of X" from some of the other class discussions. <P>It certainly does seem that Bards are an overlooked class. <P>My one wish not covered in the above posts: Can we get a song that provides our party members with beer? Perhaps a forage beer skill? Or an AE drinking song?

</FONT><HR><BR>I'm sorry about the length of my post, but I'm somewhat disappointed in my class at L50. I quit my L55 enchanter to goto a new server and start a bard because I felt Verant indirectly nerfed my class by changing the nature of the "high level" game. I'm glad I did, because in velious, my enchanter would have been completely worthless. I started my bard when velious came out, and am now regretting not start a rogue, cleric, or warrior. I have 2 accounts, bought 2 games, 2 kunarks, and 2 copies of velious (**cough** and I've spent maybe 3 hours in velious in total)... why am I so damn disappointed?<P>A few other things I would like to see added -<P>-More weapons taking the place of instruments. Even if they were only as strong as the basic instrument... would give us more reasons to use our melee (thereby increasing our damage output).<P>-Maybe change the "White dragon scale" to the cloak... at least then, someone else can use the cloak untill we kill trak, and then can multiquest the stuff. Partial solution... but still doesn't help that much. <P>-Maybe song skill specialization? Would help amp some of our song skills up some. Instead of less mana cost and less fizzles, how about decent sized effect and resist bonuses and maybe increased duration. Would be nice to weave 5 specialized songs instead of just 3. : P<P>-Fixing some of the armor/weapons. A lot of plate, 1hs, piercing, 1hb that all the other melees and hybrids can use, we can't. ***? We already suck at combat... even if you gave us the ability to use a rod of anihilation, we'd still be dead last at damage output. : P<P>-Make pick locks umm... vaguely useful? I put my initial point into it... and haven't seen the thing since. What use is it? At least I know that if I decide to farm befallen, I will have that options. Thx verant.<P>-Cueller<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well I had kind of an idea to make bards more valuable post 50 ... at least against raid boss's with AoE attacks.<P>We know that resists hard cap at 255, and anything over is just eye candy.  Well how about making resists stop at 255 with conventional items / buffs so that no matter what spells/items you had, you would be 255 max.  Then let only the bard resistance songs raise it above 255, and give it the effects that resistances should have for that value.  <P>Of course, the bard resistance songs would work as it currently does pre-255 resist as well, and you wouldnt need 255 resist to begin getting benifits (you could have 245 or so then bard song would bump you to around 280 and you would still get the 35+ resist from it).<P>This would give bards a definate want for people who now, with blue diamond jewelry, are getting higher and higher resistances all the time.  Because lets face it, a group with max resistances isnt going to want a bard save for mana, and it's just a matter of time before everyone is going to have the ability to max all their resists they need for each epic fight (many many many already have).<P>While the arguement can be made that the bard makes up for this by allowing others to fight with better equip so they dont have to switch ac/hp/mana items out for resists, this only pretains to as long as the bard lives/stays connected, and everyone know's were not nearly 100% reliable in the staying alive field.<P>So basicly, any resistance given by a bard that is over 255 is given as if there is no cap on resistances.  Seems like a great solution to me, at least for a part of our class's current problems.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think that Bards were at one point fairly balanced.  Then everything new just reflected a total lack of vision for the bard.  We share in the highest AC and most damaging weapons, but our skills to use them lack, and we haven't the HP to last long once attacked.  We get lots of neat abilities, but they lack a theme and are generally ripoffs of other class' abilities.  They also tend to get in the way and make us easily supplanted.  I would like to see a clearer focus for the bard.  My preference would be a major nerf of the bard's soloing abilities (though most have been nerfed already) coupled with a huge upgrade to group abilities.  I'd be happy to lose the fear kite/charm kite nirvana of the mid 20's to mid 30's if it meant my buffs weren't obsolete, my crowd control was usable, and I didn't get complaints about what song I was singing all the time.  <BR>As far as purely balancing bards, I think before any nerfs are made, we need to be given a clearer role (even if it is just to emphasize our jack of all trades role) and given improved abilities in that role.  Bards are the one class that should by nature always in a group, and if we had that, everything else would be easier to balance.<BR>I also want to concur with posts about our game mechanics.  We are far too subject to machine speeds and lag.  I don't think the ability to twist was the original intent with bards, but it has become the way things are.  A such, we should be able to activate more than one song at once, and leave them all active without the current system of repetitive motion.  Or, if that can't be done, make songs much more powerful but remove the twisting ability so that we have to really choose what we want to do at any given moment.<BR>Pastorious Jacos of Torvonnilous</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bards are useless on Big Raids, for 50+ characters. The only thing we contribute are high resists, and Thott of Afterlife has demonstrated that any resists over 175 or so are useless anyway. <P>However, this could be remedied by providing us a high quality damage mitigation song. <P>Not a Rune type of effect, because high level (50+) creatures hit so hard that a rune would go down instantly, and not a slow, because shamans already do that, and to create stackable slows would probably be unbalancing.<P>But rather, a song that reduces damage by a set percentage, say 30 percent or so. This would still expose a party to considerable risk, while giving the bard some usefulness against large monsters that require Raid-type assaults to succeed. Make it a level 52 song, since we only get one song at that level currently anyway, while all other 51+ levels have two songs. For balance, keep the duration short so it would require constant playing/singing, similar to the duration on Kelin's Lucid Lullaby.<P>It fits with the idea of bards as group support and would make bards very useful on large raids, without making us more powerful than other classes. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Tossing in my 2 cents so that Absor feels he's receiving a good consensus on the issues at hand.<P>The ConcertHall post (somewhere back in the first 5 responses to this thread) says much of what are the main issues.<P>I personally would like to see bards retain their usefulness in the raid type situations.  The lack of haste stacking, and the shorter duration bard mez overwriting the enchanter mez are two of my biggest gripes.<P>I would love to see enchanter mez take precedence over bard mez - means the bard would be useful in sub 55 mob cc encounters.<P>Bard haste stacking would, as has been pointed out numerous times before - place back into the useful category on raids.<P>One final issue - I have not yet been in a position to test this myself, but the pre-50 raids were classified with the bard resist songs being a key to victory.  I am under the impression, that the latter encounters - the bard resist song is of less usefulness, and often times pointless.<P>As for the bard specialization - all for it.<P>And, the nerf comment - is a standard comment that was stated in all the other class forums, don't take it personally.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One problem that I often face is that my group expect me to melee.  I honestly think that bards are better served by standing back (reducing the likelihood of mob agro) and twisting songs with instruments.  This of course is due to many bards not realising the benefits of playing (rather than singing) songs during battle.<P>One option would be to increase the effectiveness of our hand-to-hand damage (I'm talking about a weaker version of the monk hand-to-hand skills).  This would encourage players to use instruments rather than weapons - as it used to be back in the old days when Norath was young.  By increasing our weapon-based damage output (as has been suggested earlier in this thread) you're only encouraging more bards to throw away their instruments in favour of their yakesha.<P>I also love the idea of being able to equip multiple instruments in our weapons and range slots since this would also encourage players to switch from their weapons to their instruments (then we could twist 3 or 4 songs using instruments without adding significantly to the carpal tunnel syndrom already discussed).<P>Finally, what would be the harm in allowing us to start multiple songs without constantly having to click them on and off the whole time?  When you want to change a song, you could simply click one off and start the new one up.  If people want to twist 4 or 5 songs then they would have that option, but at the moment it's just so annoying to keep twisting every 5 seconds.<P>By removing some of these key obsticals to playing of what is essentially a great class would, I'm sure, increase the number of people interested in playing a bard.<P>Thanks for your attention.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here's my take on bards:<BR>Although we're supposed to be a mix of every class, in practice I think bards are mainly a rogue/enchanter hybrid, whereas all other hybrids are druid, cleric, necro/warrior classes. I think that's fine, but rogues get the good defensive skills at a skill cap that actually makes them worthwhile (parry, ripostle). I group with a ranger a lot, and although my ac is higher than hers, because I don't have these abilities, I find myself getting smoked compared even to her. I don't think bards need a taunt button, but maybe give us at least a fighting chance.<P>Second, I think bards get all the essentially worthless rogue skills (detect/disarm traps) and neither of the really neat rogue abilities that make them a cool class: pick pockets and backstab.<P>Now, I know what you are thinking, that a bard with backstab would make the rogue COMPLETELY worthless, but I'm not suggesting that you give the bard a 200 skill in it. Wouldn't it cut down on bard's damage by giving them, say, a skill cap of 50 or 60? Not only would it give us more of a "rogue" feel, but would bump up our damage output, get bards to use piercers more, and would keep the damage output low enough so as not to overpower SK's and Paladins.<P>I'm fine with the songs, except for alot of them are worthless for practical purposes. I would like to see the AE mezz song looked into a little more. I would be ecstatic to have a song that I could use to mesmerize multiple mobs, that maybe had a duration short enough so that that is the only song you can sing, and still keep them mezzed. Would free up the enchanter to cast things like berserker strength, rune, fallen haste buffs, etc.<P>Think this through please, and help us out on the melee end. I love my bard, but he can't compare to my newbie enchanter, and it only gets worse with ever new set of spells I get with the ench.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bard song effects on pets suggestion:<P>Bard songs should effect summoned pets in the group.  This should not include haste/healing effects of the songs however, since those 2 components are balanced out with pet-only bezerk/healing spells that the summoner gets.  For example while I sing the level 36 Celerity song the pet will get the +agil component but not the haste component since most of the pet casters have their own pet buff spells.  So group song effects that give a + to stats, a damage shield, runes, running speed change, etc would not seem that overpowering if it changed to effect summoned pets.  Charmed pets however should benefit from bard songs....in other words if I was to charm a HG and ping accelerando, I do not want my charmed HG pet to suddenly run at full accelerando speed after me.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>  Time to voice my couple complaints, and my reason for starting a monk who is now 40.<P>  We suffer from druid syndrome.  We get to 50+ levels, and are suddenly obsolete.  Groups need to be perfect to survive, and a bard is wasted in a perfect group.  Until about level 49, I LOVED being the guy who joined a party and took over the duty that needed doing.  I've been everything from healer to puller, tank to crowd controller, sometimes both at the same time.  Bards are pretty cool until we head for kunark/velious dungeons.<P>  We have no role.  You need an enchanter, bards cannot take over for their crowd control ability.  Now that we have an enchanter, about 95% of the songs I'd regularly sing are obsolete, don't stack with the like enchanter spells, and are all inferior.<P>  Bards have a couple roles in a group they join, abilities I'd call staple abilities.<P>  Crowd Control<BR>  Regeneration of HP / mana<BR>  Haste/buff songs<P>If an enchnater joins, I'm relegated to being a HP/mana battery.  This is not exciting.<P>  Bards need some things to be effective 50+, be them stacking hastes (let VoV, celerity, etc stack with Aanya's quickening and STLW), but they currently can't.  Stat buffs are questionably low on any priority, and they don't get anyone a group.  Bards need some high level ability that is currently NOT related to enchanters, and is more exciting than sitting in the back singing the mana song.  We need some new staple ability, or we need our old staple abilities to work in CONJUNCTION with, not instead of, enchanters.<P>  Trilian Soulwind<BR>51 bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor ...<P>It's too bad that we get looked at and thought of as .... and "negative ... nerf ...", when one can look at an Enchanter, or Cleric, and they don't even need the mana song at high levels. Or the previous Enchanter thread, where they want to manipulate the crowd AND the mana, thus making the Bard useless ... <P>Is this your vision of "usefullness" for the Bard class in this game? Or Verant's?<P>Can you not see that our usability is similar to Druids in the high levels? Resisted, and everything goes over the cap anyway, and worthless.  How do you expect a Bard to be able to get up high, and get Uber loot and then be able to compete?<P>Just as an example, and THIS IS POSTED in a Guild board, the new leader of a new guild went so far as to say "... if you are a Druid, we don't need you ...", and these are folks that came up to the top via FoH and are now doing their own thing. And Verant, you (basically), continue to do something that is forcing several classes not to be needed. I am not wanted in that Guild because I am a Bard, dude! <P>All we are asking is that we be allowed to compete and be usefull. Your caps prevent us from doing anything, and the Shaman and Enchanter buffs and debuffs, are twice better than ours, meaning that we are not needed for that anymore. All that is left is some Haste, and Mana. Haste is cap'd and Enchanter can do an insane 50% ... and we are left out, since everyone already has Haste Equipment anyway. And then there is mana. The updated version of Clarity makes the Bard song un-needed.<P>Have you any suggestions of what we can do in a group if we are doing the Guards in Thurgadin, for example, or doing Garonaire?<P>How about a really nasty suggestion. Ok. Make the Enchanter the Mez and Charm king. But make the Bard the Mana king! This will take care of one class hog'ing what we can do in the higher levels, and all of a sudden Bards will be needed, even if only as a mana battery and witch.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>   I hope this doesn't come off as insulting, but I have to ask it. I realize you have a difficult job, and at times, you sound like you REALLY don't enjoy having to do these discussions ( I don't blame you. )<P> You say that you will make suggestions etc. Occasionally you say that you may suggest a nerf to promote class balance. If you were actually more educated regarding the classes I might accept this. Class balance is a good thing, and if someone at Verant actually played and tested a bard on a regular basis, and THEN decided a nerf was in order, that would be fair. <P>However, you have on many occasions admitted your lack of understanding of many classes. You are barely qualified to suggest any enhancements as you are acting on word of mouth from others etc., but how can you in all fairness suggest any sort of a nerf without having tested it for yourself? Perhaps you should spend a little more time playing the game and less time on the boards? I'm not trying to be insulting, I just think a person in your position should have more experience( as in play time ) with the game. These decisions affect our characters which we have spent HUNDREDS of hours of our lives working on.<P> Can you please tell us how your testing staff is set up? Do you have full time people playing each class etc? How is this handled? More importantly are the people who are actually implementing the changes playing the game regularly? Bards have GOT to be the MOST thouroughly untested class in the entire game. Our songs and items often seem to have been thrown in last minute to meet some kind of deadline. This to me is THE MOST IMPORTANT enhancement that the bard class needs. TESTING. Screw everything else. Put someone in charge of bards.

</FONT><HR>Please take the time to fully understand the issues that were raised on the Concert Hall.  Many of these ideas are well thought out in my opinion. Although I doubt you’ll be able to address all of them I hope you’ll at least give them serious consideration.  <P>I play a 54 bard and of the issues raised, the most important to me are haste stacking and the viability of a bard on epic/uber encounters.  Thott has a very good explanation on the history of haste stacking:<P>http://www.afterlifeguild.org/Thott/haste_stacking.html<P>The important point is that prior to fixing the way haste stacked a bard/enchanter/shaman could take anyone to maximum haste if they had a haste item when Kunark came out.  I can only believe that Kunark was play-tested with this effect in place so the net effect of everyone at max haste could not have been overpowering or Verant would/should have fixed the bug prior to Kunark.  My understanding of why the bug was eventually fixed is:<BR>1)Restore relative value of haste items so a Cloak of Flames was actually more valuable than Flowing Black Silk Sash from a haste perspective. <BR>2) Force enchanters to use all of their haste spells since before the fix Augment and a haste item brought a player to maximum haste.  <P>The side-effect of this fix was that bards could no longer take anyone to the haste limit with their songs.  While I agree that the best haste buffs should come from a specialist such as enchanters, I would argue that bard haste should stack with other haste effects no matter the level.  The benefits to this would be that a bard and a shaman could achieve the same effect as having an enchanter in the group while a bard and an enchanter could achieve the same results that were in effect prior to haste-stacking being fixed.   This alone would restore some of the viability of grouping with an enchanter since most of our other effects are dwarfed in comparison.  I realize the two Ervaj songs were added for Velious for what appears to be this purpose but I don’t think they do enough.  Could you consider at least doubling the percentages if an instrument is equipped and removing the requirement for an instrument all the time?  10% at level 50 for Melody of Ervaj coupled with a 56 shaman buff(Celerity) will almost equal the haste given by the 53 enchanter buff (Aanya's Quickening).  This shouldn’t be overpowering with enchanters since a character with a haste item will quickly hit the cap anyway.  This also implies that a 54 bard could provide slightly better haste than a 56 shaman if he dedicates 2/3 of his time and uses instruments.  If he doesn’t use instruments then he creates the same equivalent haste as the shaman for a higher opportunity cost.<P>With regards to uber mobs and epic encounters, I’m disheartened to see my role as a resist buffer diminished to the point of non-usefulness.  When my guild fought Antonican dragons, my resist songs often made it possible for people to stay in the fight when they normally would have succumbed to fear or be destroyed by the dragons breath.  This does not seem to be the case with Kunark/Velious mobs where maximum resists of 255 and an apparent soft-cap of 175 offer the same protection.  If this is the case then the new blue diamond jewelry plus other items effectively eliminates this role for me on raids and turns me into a liability rather than an asset.  Several of the suggestions such as improving melee damage and mana drain are attempts to provide bards with a job to do again.  I believe that two bards should be as effective as one enchanter at draining mana.  I’m not sure how to improve our melee output without encroaching on paladins and shadowknights.<P>Lastly, I would like to state that I really enjoy playing a bard.  I understand fully that I’m a support class but always liked the idea that I could tip the scales in favor of my group.  By working in the background, by making the group more efficient, and by filling in where needed, I felt I made a positive contribution beyond just a walking mana/health battery.  Please give me a role to play in the end-game encounters. Thanks.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wow, some of these requests are a little overboard, but I kind of expected that.<P>My highest bard being level 41, I can't comment on the upper level stuff.  <P>I'll add my request for more mid level instruments.  Heck, implement a quest for each type of instrument (like the tambourine).<P>Finish (or fully implement) the quest that involves Fabian. (I just had to add that one in there....)<P>I've an observation on the chains song... the further alway from your level the monster is, the more likely it is to last the full duration.  Meaning if you are fighting something that is equal to your level or only a few levels below you, chances are it is not going to last more than a tick (or two).  If you are fighting a green or something that is low blue, you get the full duration on the song (more often than not).  The fact that the song has already had the maximum slowdown reduced, I'm with the others in asking that the random timer be removed... have it resist as often as it does now and last the full duration if it lands. <P>Someone asked for faster song memorization, we've already gotten that once.  When they added in the meditation skill (capped at 0 or whatever), that sped up our memorization.  Anyone who was memorizing songs prior to this upgrade for our class knows what a boost this was.  We do memorize our songs as fast as a caster with the same meditate skill. <P>Singing Steel:  I haven't gotten any, mostly because I don't want to clutter my bank account (I don't like mismatched armor, it makes me look shabby).  I hope that the effects do change.  If you are going to give useless effects on it, put shrink on one of the pieces (the arms maybe?).  There's nothing more fun than a tiny half-elf zipping by at mach 7.  Maybe give the BP Greater Shielding or something (the level 34 caster buff). <P>Here's a request, UNNERF Jonthan's Provocation.  Make it targetable and give it the minor rune effect again.  This was a good song for boosting the effectiveness of pets when we were grouped with mages (or chanters or necros).  I don't know this personally, but I have heard a few of the upper level bards grumble about this.  I was looking forward to this song, now I probably won't use it other than within the first 15 minutes after I get level 45.  A self only song at that level is pointless.  I stopped using the level 7 self only song back in my mid-20's (if not earlier).  <P>I will refrain from commenting on the lullabye.<P>The flute/drum thing.  Every time a bard thread comes up this is brought up.  Please adjust the graphics.  If/when I get to the point of going on Nagafen raids, I won't use the drum that a dragon drops because I have the tambourine because it looks like a tambourine.  <P>Speaking of dragon raids, I am planning (and this is at 41 and before) to not pass level 52 until such a time as I get both dragon scales.  I will be competing with every caster for the Vox scale and with any/all warriors for the Nagafen scale. Change the drop to be a large scale so that it isn't used in 2 (or more) other quests.  I realize that the scales drop off other mobs, but my understanding from friends in an uberguild is that Gorenaire is very very rarely killed (two maybe three times on the server I usually play).  I also want to take no part in killing Kunark dragons (or Velious ones for that matter).  I don't mind killing rogues like Vox/Nagafen.  If Gorenaire gave a long/convoluted quest for an item that replaces the dragon scale that bards could use for their epic, that would be superb.  I'm amiably to him already, make it require warm faction or something.  <P>I can accept that I am lousy at melee, at my level I'm usually swinging a fist in between songs anyway.  I expect this to continue.  Is there a way to actually dual wield the fists with an instrument in your hand?<P>Aggro aggro aggro.. why is it that every monster in the universe hates bards more than any other class?  I realize that song aggro has been dropped once already, but it's still quite high.  (as an example) in CoM the other night, a SK was pulling things, when he got back to the group even if I wasn't singing it would fly past him and smack me until he taunted it off.  This isn't all that uncommon, in other places any monsters beyond the first will charge past the tanks to the caster area where I am.<P>Those are all my comments/suggestions for the moment.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>*****<BR>Absor,<BR>*****<P>I doubt you'll read this far, but if so, I've tried to make your name more noticeable because I have several points to make:<P>1.  "Bards are the most beat on of any class..."  Aradune<P>2.  "Bards are not really a hybrid class..."  Abashi<P>What do these points have to do with anything?<P>Well, for the most part, if Bards are indeed the most beat on class (and at least up to and through the mid levels they appear to be) Bards are in SERIOUS need of a melee or defensive upgrade.<P>Consider this, I've played two bards, one up to 50 (BEFORE all the nerfs), and one up to 27 (AFTER all the nerfs), and I've also played warriors, druids, rogues, rangers, wizards, enchanters, etc. etc. etc.<P>I've yet to play ANY class that can agro mobs out of a train chasing someone else by doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, other than that of the bard.<P>Seriously!  In Cazic, Unrest, or Mistmoore, some of your more train prevelant zones in the game I can have my bard, sitting, not singing, barely in agro range of a passing train, and at least ONE of the mobs if not more from that train will veer off and start attacking the mob.  These mobs will PASS BY a meditating caster, ignore the taunting warrior or ranger, and STILL attack the bard.<P>It's laughable that it happens this way, but it does...<P>Please fix this agro issue.<P>2.  On the "we're not a hybrid, we're a unique class" thing, I think this has been the largest crippling concept for us Bards.  It seems Verant is VERY worried about the Bards infringing on the capabilities of the parent classes, yet if the Bard is NOT a hybrid class, then the Bard has no parent class to infringe upon.<P>ALL of our limitations seem to be based on one of two things:<P>1.  Bards aren't allowed to exceed any other class in any other area.<P>2.  Bards don't require mana to do their job (mostly).<P>If number one is TRULY one of the criteria in all design changes for bards then Verant has to understand the incredible burden of SUCK they put onto bards.  If a Bard is not allowed to exceed any other class in any ability what so ever, bards will ALWAYS end up on the short end of the stick.<P>This attitude needs to change. <P>Bards are a unique class and therefore need to be handled as such.<P>2.  If "mana" is another big hang up, I suggest altering the bard songs to require stamina.  Right now the bard songs that do require mana are so intense that the time to reuse either matches or exceeds most of the new disciplines available!  I can't see how THAT has slipped your attention.<P>After all, with no mana regen benefits to be had by the bard, not even with mana stones or necro spells, ANYTHING, Bards, by FAR, have the longest mana regen/total mana of ANY class, YET Bards do get to sing a fairly decent mana regen song that all other classes benefit from.<P>So if we were to make the songs stamina based, then bards could still use the songs.  The better the song, the more stamina required to sing it, and therefore the larger the need the bard has to have be grouped.<P>I don't know, this was a quick idea, but as we hope you can see, the mana regen thing, and the limitation bards get because of our lack of "mana use" hurts bards to the extreme.<P>Wake up, and change your attitudes on this.  I'd like to bring my remaining bard out of partial retirement...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I wanted to speak in support of the issues raised on the Concert Hall, and put together by Kaearia (posted above by NOR_Bard). If you will read through that list carefully, you will have a good explanation of perhaps 95% of the issues bards face. Many folks spoke up in working out that list. <P>Also, take a look at the links posted above by Thott. Thott has done some remarkable log parsing and graphed many specific points of information regarding how bards are and are not balanced with other classes, particularly at the upper levels. <P>Although my bard is only level 35, I've followed all the discussions and as near as I can tell these two are presenting a good concensus on bard issues.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Firstly, I would like to respond to some of the earlier posts. <P>Ac on Bard armor is like chain. <BR>This is true for only mid or lower level bards (if that).<BR>Comparing AC on the drops off of:<BR>&lt;B&gt;Trakanon BP's&lt;/B&gt;<BR>Warrior Cobolt 45 AC<BR>Bard Singing Steel 40 AC<BR>Paladin Deepwater 40 AC<BR>Shadow Knight BE 40 AC<BR>Ranger Tolans 35 AC<BR>Rogue Mrylokar 35 AC<P>&lt;B&gt;Hate / Fear BP's&lt;/B&gt;<BR>Warrior Incicolite 35 AC<BR>Paladin Valorium 30AC<BR>Shadow Knight Umbral 30AC<BR>Bard Imbrued 26 AC<BR>Ranger Thorney Vine 26 AC<BR>Rogue Wolven 26 AC<P><BR>White scale difficulties for the Singing Shortsword.<P>Comparing to other classes particle weapon quests I don't see the white sccale being any more difficult then some of the other classes "possible" drops. I am not saying it's easy by any means but there are 2 chances you get to obtain a white scale. Lady Vox and Gor. I can say that the requirement for killing 3 different dragons may be a bit much though. Maybe it is because getting a red scale is very easy?!?<P>Dirge taking to much mana. <BR>I think this song works find for its level. It is a "last resort" song not a "regularly used during battle" song. Maybe the improvement should go toward mana regeneration.<P>Now for some of my own observances of the bard.<P>Weapons: It seems that any "good" weapon is multi class or warrior only. When you hunt with the guild the "norm" for an ubber weapon will usually result in giving it to the "ubber melee" (war, shd, pal, rng) classes. "This weapon is best utalized on a warrior" is the normal response. Well, Warriors have double if not triple the "class specific" amount of weapons then any other class. They have their own and many ranges from mid to high levels. Make some more "bard specific" weapons available. This also goes in line with haste items. The same circumstances when a haste item drops (cloak of flames, ruined bolster belt, etc...) it goes to a "ubber melee".<P>Songs:<BR>Mana drain. Need I say more? It is useless! If I had the chance to do it all over again I would of not spent the 2 pp on these songs. They are "totally worthless".<P>Resistant psalm and guardian series songs are slowly becoming a "toy" to make people feel better. Over 20 Trakanon raids with poison resists at 250 and not once did I not get poisoned. If 250 is the max, then please look into the saving throws against them. I might as well play some haste songs so I can die like a warrior!<P>Duration of charm and mes songs need to be lenghten. I can understand an enchanter messing 20 mobs as the "master" of this skill but compared to a max 3 that a bard can do is pathetic. Upping the length of these types of songs makes the bard a bit more appealing to grouping. <P>Jack of all trades master of none. Well we can do one thing better then any other class; we can run, run, run. Besides that we don't even compare in ratio to any other. Paladin, warrior, ranger, rogue, and shadow knights all get dual attack. Wizzards, magicians, and enchanters can nuke beyond belief. Shaman, druids, and necromancers can dot. Clerics can heal like no other. Bards can....well....."enhance the group" maybe?!?<P>More to come. Have to log on my cleric to res my poor bard. :P</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I few things I would like to see:<P>1) Some kind of AE stun. Maybe replace the 49 or 50 songs which are junk anyway. Let it have a lengthy recycle time (or cost mana) in order to 'balance' it.<P>2) Let sneak and hide work the same way rogue sneak/hide works (they stack and give success messages). Rely on the low skill caps for any balance concerns. <P>3) Enhance the level 20 invis song to include ITU.<P>4) Raise lockpick skill caps so its remotely useful. Maybe make it so only 55+ bards can get 200 skill level, or, make a special lockpick item that increases your skill when wielded (then make that item rare, etc. )<P>5) Offer Bards Double Attack, capped at a low level (anything to give us useable melee skills).<P>Baramore<BR>Humble Servant of Bristlebane<BR>Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The only other feedback I would give are with Instrument skills we receive wind skill at level 14, and first wind song is 11...with brass it is level 11 and first brass song is at 18. Perhaps switching the skills to reflect the song a little better?

</FONT><HR>woot!  these are some of the most thought out and well stated comments in any class posts.  <P>Thott's power curve charts (kudos to you) reflect on the glaring weakness of Bards in the post 50 game.

</FONT><HR>I currently play a 59 cleric and a 35 bard.  There seem to be some great ideas going into the balancing of the bard class.  Though I cannot comment on the higher-level playing of the class, there are a couple bugs that have been mentioned that I thought would be helpful to mention again.<P>First, I frequently lose control of a charmed mob, but the "song has worn off" message is a few seconds late.<P>Second, I have found that if a song is re-sung just before the same song is about to wear off, the refreshed effect also wears off and you must sing it again.<P>For example,<BR>1. "Your feet feel faster."<BR>2. -play 2 other songs here-<BR>3. "Your feet feel faster."<BR>4. "Your feet slow down."<P>At 1, start playing selo's accelerando.  2 play any other two songs.  3 play selo's again.  Less than half a second later at 4, the above message is seen, and both the icon and effect from the selo's song are removed.  The song, selo's in this example, must then be sung again.<P>In a recent slaying of the Overking in Chardok, I had the enchanters and one bard that were present use their mana draining abilities.  The enchanters, both around level 52, were successful 100% of the time.  The bard, level 54, had EVERY pulse of her song resisted in the 90 second, or so fight.  This seems like a balance issue that needs to be worked out.<P>Finally, I think it would be sensible to increase bard's lockpicking skill to 201.  This would allow them to put this skill to real use.  As was stated before, when we finally get the skill(level 40), all but one of the locked doors pickable with a 100 skill lead to green mobs, and acess to the latter(The Hole), can be gained through a very insignificant purchase of a key.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello Absor.  I play a 55th bard and a 52nd bard.  I have been playing my bard since 1 month after the release of EverQuest, and I have completed several high end bard tasks, including several Sky Quests, and my Epic Weapon.  Thus, I feel I am qualified to comment about bards.<P>First, let me suggest the one nerf that I believe is justified for our class.  Add mana-usage to our 27th level charm song.  As it is, this charm is ridiculously powerful, and makes soloing gobs of experience easy.  Adding manausage to this song, as in the 37th level charm, would definitely be justified.<P>However, despite the power of our charm, there are several issues with the higher level game.  First, let me address our crowd control abilities.<P>Our crowd control is perfectly balanced.  I can mez 3 mobs consistently, 4 with a bit of luck and while taking a bit of pounding.  However, our charm begins to decrease in usefulness as we level.  Quite simply, the level cap on charm needs to be raised from 51 to 54 or 55.  The level cap on SoT needs to be raised to 57.  And, while we're discussing level caps, the level cap on Appalling Screech (Fear) needs to be raised to 55 or 56.  The songs are perfect, and just as they should be, however, the level caps simply need reworking.<P>For ideas on our healing, damage output, haste, and mana regeneration, please refer to the excellent articles Thott linked to.  Also note that bards were originally the only class with mana regeneration abilities, and enchanters were given the ability as not to give bards a monopoly.  I feel that our abilities should reflect this, and slightly increasing the efficiency of Chorus of Clarity and Cantana would not be out of line.<P>Please allow the enchanter spells Breeze, Clarity, and Clarity 2 to overwrite Cantana.  It is obnoxious as all hell to have to stop my manasong every time some caster in my group wants a c2.<P>I consider equipment issues to be balance issues as well- if a bards high-end equipment is not as powerful as it should be, then the bard is less powerful than he should be.  The opposite also applies.  Thus, let me address a few issues.<P>Melodic Greaves.  The only Growth legs without an effect.  Why?<P>Melodic Breastplate.  Selo's Song of Travel- useful in theory.  However, when you right-click on the Breastplate, your new song immediately breaks the old song, and your invisibility, levitate, and speed immediately drop for the three seconds it takes for the song to recast.  An utterly worthless effect, which needs changing or reworking.<P>Singing Steel Greaves:  Summon Food.  Need I say anything more?<P>Singing Steel Breastplate:  Invigorate heals less than our songs.  Also note that our songs heal the entire party.  Also note that, when using songs, we can grant the party mana regeneration and stamina regeneration.  Please change this effect to either a 5 second casting time, or make it a self-only Greater Heal.  Neither would be unbalancing, and would simply reflect the actual intention of this piece of armor.<P>Singing Steel Boots:  Summon Drink.  See Singing Greaves.<P>Singing Steel Helm:  Eye of Zomm.  Gosh, this "need I say more" thing is getting pretty old.<P>Singing Steel Arms:  Invigorate.  We have songs that do it better, do it for the entire party, and do other things besides.  Eliminate or upgrade.<P>Plane of Air quests:<P>Mask of the Songbird:  Perfectly fine item.<P>Songweavers Mantle:  The AC of 9 is somewhat subpar on this item.  Please consider an increase to 12.  Considering that Gullerback, a creature I can with little to no trouble, drops a mantle with AC 12, I hardly think that an item which requires a rare drop the the Keeper of Souls would be justified in having a mere 9 AC.<P>Agilmente's Flute of Flight:  Nice item.<P>These are the only 3 Sky quests I have completed, so I can't comment from firsthand experience on the others.  However, the AC of 4 on the Amulet seems underpowered, please consider an increase to 6.<P>Please consider increasing the Rune on Shield of Song to double it's current strength.<P>Velious Songs:<P>Melody and Composition of Ervaj are absolutely useless.  My epic weapon adds 55% haste.  I usually have either an enchanter or shaman around to buff on top of that, often with Shissar.  Most tanks I group with use items with 30%+ haste.  When am I EVER going to use an additional 5% haste?  I would rather twist *shudder* manasong than these.  Please set them as Manadrains, as they were originally.<P>Occlusion of Sound is nice enough, keep it.<P>Give us a song.  The rest of the Hybrids got one, why can't we?  Else, admit we're not a hybrid and give us the levels we should have were it not for our hybrid experience penalty.  I applaud you on the removing of it, yet choose whether we are hybrids or not.  If yes, give us our song.  If no, give us our levels.<P>Possible song ideas/changes:<P>50 Melody of Ervaj:  Change this to a targetted manadrain.<P>55 New Hybrid Song:  Make this an AE manadrain, one that actually works (unlike Dissension).<P>60 Composition or Ervaj:  Make this a more powerful targetted manadrain.<P>Adding manadrains to the bard class would give us a nice comfortable niche in raids.  Our old niche in raids was to pump the resists of the other fighters.  However, with exceptional new resist gear available, a cap of 255 on resists, and a series of diminishing returns past 175, this is no longer necessary.  Manadrains would give us a role.<P>There are several more problems with the bard class, however, I feel that Thott and others have addressed them more than adequately.  Please note what I and others have said, and consider balancing the class accordingly.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm in a large guild, and most of my groups have included an Enchanter. It's great exept for the fact that it narrows my role to a resist/ regen machine, and secondary tank.<P>The party is hasted, and crowds are under control.<BR>I have very very rarely ever needed to use charm or mez.<P>Bards are by no means useless when there are enchanters around, but it certainly makes me wish that we had more flexability in that situation. Anyone in a big raid guild, knows what im talking about... Many Enchanters and Shaman present at the hunt, covering slows, buffs and crowd control. Epic weapons hasting melee,<BR>Which leaves bards singing mana, and acting as a *distant secondary* tank.<P>Verant has always seemed reluctant to give bards any serious melee ability, for fear of unbalencing the class.<P>I can certainly understand that consern, but I feel that at the very highest levels of the game, that our role, and the effectiveness of other classes changes drasticly enough to present the need for some changes, in part to our melee ability.<P>In my opinion, Bards need to be able to better preform as a secondary tank at level 57-60. That can be accomplished in many ways, through making some haste songs stack with other classes haste buffs or raising our skill caps to that of other hybrids at level 60. Other very high level options might include a low capping backstab (keeping in line with our Rogue traits) or a low capping double attack. a low cap in my mind would be 75-100.<BR>************************************<BR>Another issue is the recast time on our level 55 song, Brusco's Bombastic Bellow, (222 direct damage). Currently at a 5 minute recast, I dont know of a single Bard that keeps it memorised. 222 damage is an extremely small ammount of damage to require<BR>such a long recast. A huge delay reduction would be required to make it usefull, something in the neighborhood of an 12 second recast. <P>Our level 12 Brusco's Boa****ll Bellow of the same line, can be recast every 3 seconds for 27 direct damage each cast at level 55, meaning that in the time it takes to refresh this level 55 song, a bard can do 2700 damage with the level 12 song. With a 12 second recast on our level 55 Brusco's, bard would do 2664 damage in the 5 minute period. Making this adjustment to our high level Brusco's line would make the song worth useing.<P>************************************** <P>Catana of Replentishment, or level 55 mana/health regen, has stacking problems with Enchanters Clairity II, in that a bard has to stop singing the song before an Enchanter can cast the spell on a group member, which is very annoying.

We have a very very nice epic weapon.  It is WELL worth the effort put in.  Also, I kinda like the way it is, especially the white scale.  You need one of 3 things to obtain a white scale:  Uberness (kill Gorenaire) Friends and Contacts (kill Vox) or Resourcefullness and Trading Skills (buy one).  Honestly, I believe that any bard who deserves to wield such an item will have one of these three characteristics.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My take on the issues from a mid-level Bard ( lv 35 )...<P>1. Range on travel type songs is too low, whether that's selo's, invis, or levitate. Different chars run at diff speeds ( or seem to ) due to weight..isp, latency issues aside. Nothing like getting dropped in a ditch for 10,000 hp dmg or go 'visible' as you run past A_kickyourbutt_critter_001.<P>2. Rogue class 'carrots'..<BR>a) Picklocks...utterly useless, and i don't even have the skill enabled yet ( at lv35 ).<BR>b) Sneak/Hide that does not work like the Rogue class. Ditch the sneak, give us 'greater clouding' at lv X that has invis/invis undead/see invis.<P>3. Song stacking. Imho, all songs/spells should stack, class/race regardless. If it's Verants intent to promote grouping, then give all classes who can 'buff' some incentive.<P>4. Melee/instruments ... we can wear plate, but have the hps of a caster. I don't think we should have double attack, and i don't think we should be able to do melee dmg equal to any other hybrid never mind a war, monk, rogue. However, if it's Verants intent that we buff by song to enchance the 'groups' performance, why not give us the ability to dual wield instruments so we can get that tiny bit extra out of our songs?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>In reply to the few people that said the epic weapon should stay the way it is.... ummm... how would you feel if you had to redo the quest?<P>The uberness factor... the ONLY way you will drop gorenaire is if you're an uber-uber guild. You probably can count the number of servers that have DONE it on one hand. <P>Friends and contacts? Are you kidding me? I'm L50, and we failed our last 4 out of 5 vox attempts. All my "friends and contacts" are WAY over the level cap. If I was on an old server, the likelyhood of me getting friends and contacts' twinks together to hit vox is greater than my friends and contacts' mains doing it.<P>Trading ability. I thought we weren't supposed to BUY our uber weapons? The cash it'd run you to buy a vox scale probably is 50k pp+. Not to mention any guild that rips off it's own bards to sell the thing to a higher level bard is dispicable. <P>My problem isn't the difficulty... it's forcing me to remain under L53... in a sick and twisted way, I kinda wish it could only be gotten off gorenaire, at least then I would rush my way to L60 so I could whoop up on her instead of farming. : P<P>-Cueller</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>&gt;&gt;This may include a nerf or two, I want to warn you of that. I am just as willing to suggest a negative <BR>&gt;&gt;change that helps to achieve balance as a positive one.<P>I can't think of any other class that has recieved more nerfs than the bard, and I can't for the life of me think of ANY aspect of the bard that is left to nerf.<P>I'm pretty sure every song effect, skill, etc. has already been nerfed to the lowest possibly effectiveness (if not below) already.  Please, please, please, please, PLEASE don't nerf us any more.  If you can't INCREASE some abilities, just leave us the hell alone, we don't want no more nerfs.<P>Please remove the great burden of SUCK from it.<P>Bards are the LEAST played class at the higher levels on all the servers I've played, so that should tell you something.<P>At mid levels they're fun to twink, but once you start getting higher, they're just doggone burdensome to play...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052807-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052807.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052807-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052807-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052807-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052807-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052807-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052807&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052807&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
