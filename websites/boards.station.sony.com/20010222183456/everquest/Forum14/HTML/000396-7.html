</FONT><HR>Someone brought up our Jaundiced Bone Breastplate, which, bizarrely, has a self-only 29th level Druid spell on it.<P>As with our Epic Weapon, it is a question of what makes sense for our class and what is balanced for the level of the dragon that drops it.<P>Verant sees us as buffers.  In that line, some sort of buff on the Breastplate would make sense.  Talisman of Kragg would be nice as a free cast off of the Breastplate.  Some sort of uberbuff like Focus of the Spirit or Avatar might be considered too powerful by some (although I can't imagine why, since Boon of the Garou, a 44th level Enchanter spell, is better than both).<BR>Self-only spells like Bramblecoat are not the forte of a buffing class IMO.<P>Bramblecoat would be a balanced effect if these items were trash drops off of random frogs in Sebilis and the Donal's BP had the Effect of Yaulp 2.  But this drops off of a Dragon that few in the game will ever see and that requires a team of two dozen or more very dedicated people to overcome.<P>As for the Spear, we see ourselves as debuffers.  In that case, Malo, Malosini or Turgurs Insects would be an appropriate effect, much more so than some Necro DOT.  Perhaps this would be an interesting place to put the 'unresistable Lure-based' 40% Slow that has been requested of late or a Bear Pet that was around 39th to 44th level like our 55th level Pet would have been had the progression for our 34th, 39th, 44th and 49th level Pets been followed.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OK, I need to add my 2 cp to this list.  I think that Suvo hit the nail on the head waaaaaay back on page 2.  VI is supposedly striving for class balance, and as long as three classes exist that ALL raids depend upon, there is no balance.  When Warriors, Clerics, or Chanters are not available, worthwhile raids do NOT happen.  Sure you can go kill Seafury Cyclopses without them or hunt in DL, but no major raid can occur.  That surely is not the case with ANY of the other classes.  THAT is a significant balance issue in and of itself.  <P>Shaman are great chars to play in the low-to-mid level game, we do many things pretty well, but if you are in this game for the post 50 stuff -- play a Chanter or a Cleric, cause we Shammys just don't cut it post 50.  How's that for balance?  How many raids are canceled because the Shaman has to log?  NONE, because we can be replaced, and that's the way it should be with any class leaving -- THAT is balance.<P>Again, just my 2 cp, but we need to have healing ability slightly below that of a Cleric.  The fact that a level 39 Cleric can easily outheal a 60 Shaman sure doesn't meet my definition of slightly.  I do not argue that Clerics should be better, more efficient healers, but be reasonable.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hmm Maulson, is us defense skill capped?  It seems to me that it is way off cap (cap is 200).  Because I remeber askin a barb shaman on my server what her naked ac was and she said 546.  But she wasnt sure if it was capped.  If her defense wasnt capped then she would have been able to make some more of the difference.  So I was figurin the ac difference was 41 or less.  BtW my ac 587 is naked and unbuffed.

</FONT><HR>I would still like to see the true Class Defining feature of Shamans be brough forth.<P>If the class defining feature is buffs, why are stat buffs of minimal value in the game? And why would enchanters get speed boots far in excess of ours? What about group buffs? Some exist post-50, I admit, but they are embarassing to use, considering how low they are compared to single target buffs.<P>If the class defining feature is debuffing, why do enchanters have the slow line and mages the Malo line?<P>Absor, don't get me wrong, I like playing a shaman. But I have yet to see the main reason we were put here. Especially in the post-50 game. The list you created, while bring up some good points, does very little if any to help that.

</FONT><HR>A few months ago I started a shaman. After reading all this I really don't know why. <P>Alchemy is very expensive and mostly worthless.<P>Clerics get better buffs (hp and ac... you know, the ones that MATTER and have a noticable effect??) and heals.<P>Druids get the same heals, group wolf form, teleports and same regen.  I sit here and buff my own agility for lack of something better to do.<P>After days of reading debates I have decided on the best course of action.  <P>Give Clerics SoW and Teleport spells.<BR>Give warriors Feign Death, Backstab, and tracking.<BR>Keep enchanters and wizards around for the fun of it.<BR>Monks, rogues, bards, necros, mages, shamans, SKs, Pallys, rangers, and finally those annoying DROODS can just all be removed from the game.  I'm sure things will go much smoother.  Never have a weak group again, and in addition they could stop spreading spells and abilities between classes by spell and item.  no more nerfing, just twink what everybody envys and get rid of the rest.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Here's the disclaimer.  I play a 45 Shaman, so my comments, as with those of most of the poters carries with it a certain self interest.  Having said that, let me throw my vote behind what I believe is the concensus here.  <P>"Shaman... her primary focus is healing..."   Well clearly not.  I was in a well balanced group hunting wurms in Great Divide.  No cleric, so I along with a 50 Druid functioned as the emergency healer.  On double pulls, we had deaths on three occasions that could not be prevented.  GH restores 300+ Hps.  The wurms were double attacking for 90, with a kick thrown in for 60 or so, and a DD spell for around the same.  Even were I able to chain cast GH, I can't possibly keep up with that sort of damage, even with unlimited mana.  Not to mention that the long casting duration of GH frequently meant my potential targets had, of necessity, moved out of range.  And this was fighting MOBs of around 34-37, with a 5 person group ranging from 44 to 50!!!<P>The solution, as I see it, is for Shaman, and Druids as the other secondary healers, to get a more efficient spell; perhaps as suggested a percentage heal.  Otherwise, even at this level a cleric has become essential to group function.<P>As to Stat buffs.  Right now other than AC speed and HP's they do nothing measurable.  Quick show of hands here, how many of you self cast the others when soloing??   Thought so   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Solution?  Well there are two schools of though, one is to take what we have, and change the algorithm to make them do something measurable.  This does not seem too hard to me; the formula to assess damage taken already has a multistep calculation, to extract from that the element due to the buff as opposed to the equipment seems pretty straightforward.  Some kind of multiplier here, together with removal of the soft cap would seem to work.   The other school of thought is to add additional categories of buffs, explicitly labelled as chance to hit, chance to avoid and the like.  This too, doesn't sound very demanding.<P>Now how about the pets?  They add a layer of complexity without much benefit, unless, and only unless another caster is fearing or snaring the MOB.  So if the pet is added as a tool for soloing, it is pretty near useless.  Even then, as a shaman ages, the pets become progressively worse, a level 44 pet, buffed, cannot solo a green Dire Wolf in Great Divide.  Why not?  They are both wolves after all, and my pet is armored, speeded and has more hit points.<P>Solution. There are two viable approaches, first just make the pets better, why can't I summon a blue pet at 45.  I'm not asking for equality with Mages or Necros, second tier is fine, not a pet from the bargain bin.  The alternative is to drasticaly reduce the casting costs.  If Shaman are one with the spirit world why is it so darned expensive to make a call?  Why can't I chain cast pets?  Why would this be unbalanced?<P>Damage dealing is another area that clearly needs a rethink.  Straight off, disease spells, as they currently play just take far too long.  Soloing they have some utility, as most blue MOBs require more than one Poison DOT application.  In groups they are hopeless.  The poison based DOTs are mostly OK, although clearly there is a gap at 54, where we should get a vendor  spell commensurate with the level, as well as a purchasable poison based DD.  As to the rarity of the upper level spells, if the statements are accurate, this needs fixing.  If spells are only dropped off epic MOBs, then the effect should be equally epic.  Double the mana efficiency of the DOT or DD, make effects lat until you log.<P>Solutions.  Well firstly, either reduce the duration and up the effect of disease DOTs, or create two types, one shorter acting (perhaps a fever line lasting 14 ticks) and a second chronic disease line based on Rabies which as I recall lasts an EQ day, but does a smaller amount of damage per tick, with the two disease types not stacking.  Why the latter you ask? To be able to remove the accelerated regeneration that most MOBs have when compared to players, thus adding a tactical choice to the situation.  Second, make our MalXXXXX line the total debuff package.  There seems no game play or role play reason for disease to be exluded here, and I have never personally, nor heard of anyone else csting the disease specific debuffs.<P>The MOB debuff line needs balancing, both in terms of fizzle rates, resist rates and measurable effects.  Incapacitate, according to the tanks, does not have a measuarble effect on MOBs.  This does not make sense, even if this is designed primarily for PVP, I fail to see why this cannot affect MOBs.  Once again, a simple multiplier in the algorithm would seem to be a quick and easy fix.<P>Finally there is alchemy.  I can only shake my head here.  The quite ridiculous cost is one thing.  The absurd failure rate once a potion has become trivial is another.  The bizarre unavailability of ingredients a third.  (Note to the geographically challenged, Halas is a long way from anywhere, and five zones and a lot of running from the nearest spires and ring.)  The worthless nature of almost all of the potions a fourth.  The worst thing though is the absence of truly useful potions that could be made, albeit at a high cost.  Why not a Complete Heal potion, why not a self or group teleport?  What is unbalancing about a Clarity potion?  <P>Solution, just rethink the entire skill, make either worth something, or leave it as is, and make it cheaper by a factor of 10.<P>Let me end with a question to Absor, if all the Shaman on all the servers stopped playing right now, would anyone else notice?  How about Warriors, Clerics or Enchanters?  Thought so, now tell us one more time about class balance and class playability in the post Kunark era.<P>/Sigh</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Thanks for the comments, just some observations:<P>- increasing damage 2% for each 10 points over 100 is a bit crazy.  Getting 255 str is trivial.  Adding 13.4% damage for a 150 mana spell that lasts 2 hrs (67 str from manical str) is just  blows any other buff out of the water.  That is truly unbalancing.  The general problem with making any substantial upgrades to the buff spells is that they stack with pretty much everything else.  Given the strange facination some shaman have with being buffers (god knows why you want to be), how about this for an idea (I don't know if any of this is feasible within the current game architecture and I don't necessarily endorse them all - just tossing them out there as a focus for discussion):<P>STR - in addition to whatever bonus to damage arises from the added strength, the level 57 buff adds 10% of the base weapon rating to the damage done.  Thus a 10/25 weapon would gain +1 to magic number and a 30/46 two hander would gain +3.  My thinking he is to try to suggest a change which isn't overly biased towards fast weapons with good ratios.<P>STA - add a small +hp component to this spell.  I would suggest the spell give +hp equal to the +sta (this is in addition to the hp gain from the stamina increase).  For the level 54 spell this would give +50 more hps to all classes.<P>AGI - I have no clue what to do here that would work within the current framework.  Maybe add a small additional +AC component, but this might add stacking issues.<P>DEX - Add a small +ATK component to this spell.  I would suggest for starters that the level 58 buff add +20 ATK in addition to the dex increase.<P>CHA - who cares.<P>- regarding the effect on the JB BP.  Yeah, bramblecoast may seem a little weak, but things like Talisman (of anything) or Focus is just ungodly.  Just consider the ability to combine a manaless talisman spell with a shaman's ability to cannibalize.  You will never be OOM with that combo.  Can anyone say Deepwater Helm?  I knew ya could.<P>- In light of the powerlevel of mobs in SoV, some consideration needs to be given to the damage level on shaman dots.  Like all other spells the deal damage, they are insignificant compared to melee damage.<P>- EvilChu is 100% on this time, the new healing spells are a crock for shaman.  I would really like Verant to consider my proposal:<BR> <BR> * move superior healing to 49th<BR> * move this new chloroblast to 53rd<BR> * add something like celestial heal ing at 56th (4 ticks of 180 hps) for 200 mana<BR> * keep torpor.<P>This would give shaman a mana efficient spell without coming close to the efficiency of a cleric.  Remember, the heals over time have built in restrictions which tend to balance them.<P>Dwilgar<BR>Luminary of Rallos Zek<BR>Rodcet Nife<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Greetings Fellow Shaman and Shamaness,<BR>Another patch... Another Disappointment  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/mad.gif"> . Nothing about our stat bufs and exactly what are the benefits of buffing someone.<BR>I think our stat bufs SHOULD MAKE a difference when casted upon someone. In any AD&D based game (Baldur's gate, PlaneScape Tornment, Icewindale, Diablo etc..etc...) Stats DO make a difference and it IS noticable. When starting your character in EQ you have certain points you add to a certain stat and each race/class has its own advantages, disadvantages when it comes to stats. So WHY? Why we can not see a noticable result when casting our stat bufs upon our group? If we are the masters of the bufs, so make us feel like it. It is very very aggrevating to keep on following this topic and being disappointed by it everytime there is a patch. I was waiting this patch might fix it but noooooooo... we are not that important yet to get what we have been asking for since the begining... Maybe Verant programmers do not know how to come up with algorithms to deal with the stat bufs, although there were TONS of suggestions by many Shamans on how it might be implemented. Bottom line, another disappointed shaman. If I knew better I would have not even started a shaman (although I love my shaman, and I strongly believe in stat bufs because I DO play other AD&D games).<BR>Verant, or whoever decides about this matter, please consider what we have been asking for and explain to us WHY we can not get what we deserve.<P>Thanks,<BR>Vrej DeLoneWolf<BR>Shaman of BristleBane<BR>Master Alchemist<BR>48 Winters<BR> <BR> <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"Thanks for the comments, just some observations:<BR>- increasing damage 2% for each 10 points over 100 is a bit crazy. Getting 255 str is trivial. Adding 13.4% damage for a 150 mana spell that lasts 2 hrs (67 str from manical str) is just blows any other buff out of the water. That is truly unbalancing....."<P>Ok Maybe you're right. But I dont think it's nearly as unbalancing as spell like complete heal. In any case make it 1% or increase the mana cost or make the base 170 str etc. The point is there are a lot of things you can do. Also remember we are supposed to be *masters* of buffs. We could also make the extra effects limited to melee classes so we don't abuse it soloing. The idea here is to make us more useful in groups.<P>"STA - add a small +hp component to this spell. I would suggest the spell give +hp equal to the +sta (this is in addition to the hp gain from the stamina increase). For the level 54 spell this would give +50 more hps to all classes."<P>STA already has a +hp component to it. Out of all the stat buffs this one is the already most useful. Maybe we should just leave this one alone, or we could had a small HP regen to it.<P>"AGI - I have no clue what to do here that would work within the current framework. Maybe add a small additional +AC component, but this might add stacking issues."<P>AGI already has a +AC component. AGI be changed to increase chance to dodge and other defensive procs by some significant figure based on the final stat value.<P>"DEX - Add a small +ATK component to this spell. I would suggest for starters that the level 58 buff add +20 ATK in addition to the dex increase."<P>DEX already has a +ATK component to it however small it is. I would add an extra bonus to double hits, crits etc. again based on the stat value. This should be something really noticable so tanks can see it.<P>Note, in all these examples above we are talking about effects that are associated with the stat buffs themselves, not the stats.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Abdwil, Dwilsor, Absilgar, Absor-Dwilgar... Aw heck, you know who you are.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>“Lets say it is possible to code an effect on the strength buff that actually increases tank damage by x% per hit. My question is keeping the current duration and mana cost, what should x be? Would you be happy if x was 3%? 5%? 10%? Just curious. I am trying to understand what the expectation is and whether it is realistic. “<P>There already appears to be an imbalance between casters and meleers at high levels (spells are highly resistible, swords are not), so we wouldn’t want to exacerbate the issue by making the str buff be overly powerful. Let’s say a cap of 10% damage increase for the highest Shaman str buff.<P>Agi is a different story. With the hitting power of the new mobs a healthy increase seems warranted here. I would say a target of 30% max here is good. Whether that means more ac, better chance to dodge/parry/block/etc, or a combination of both I don’t know.<P>Dex I think should increase chance to hit. It can’t be chance to crit because too many melee types don’t get crits. The 2h classes (paladins and SKs) in particular seem to miss a lot, so I would say 15 to 20% max increase in chance to hit here.<P>Stam should add more HP than it does. Again because of the high damage output of new mobs I would say a 20% max increase would be warranted. Here’s a novel idea... How about it actually provides some stamina? Like so the warrior types can finish more than one mob without asking for a Zinger?<P>I am, of course, just pulling numbers out of thin air that seem reasonable to me. However, let me just say that if we are supposed to be *the* master buffers, our high level buffs at least should be worthy of the title.<P>I think it would be helpful if you all would suggest (or re-suggest if you posted to previous talk threads) additional alternatives for improving Shammy buffs. The more options we can present to Absor the better.<P>Regards<P>P.S. Glad to see you coming around a bit on this issue Dwilgar.

Blows any buff out of the water?  OK, let's look at a few other spells... <P>Augment<BR>Level 56 enchanter.<BR>Effect - increase attack speed by up to 48%, *and hence damage output by 48%*, for 36 minutes, at a cost of 135 mana.

Duration 42 minutes, mana 275.<P>And you are calling a 13.4% improvement out of whack?  It pales in comparison to what these spells provide, pales immensely, almost grotesquely.  Blows any other buff out of the water?  Frankly it hardly compares to some of the buffs already out there.

</FONT><HR>Just a note here. I took a 30 shaman over to the fort in FM, grouped with 3 tanks and, later, 2 other shamen.<BR>So, with 3 tanks (SK, War, Mnk) the spells fell as follows.<P>1 shaman.<BR>  Quickness, Tigirs, GHeal, SoW<P>2 shamen<BR>  shaman 1<BR>  Quickness, Tigirs, GHeal in emergencies<BR>  shaman 2<BR>  Envenomed Breath, SoW, GHeal<P>3 shamen<BR>  shaman 1<BR>  Quickness, Tigirs, GHeal in emergencies<BR>  shaman 2<BR>  Envenomed Breath, Spirit Strike, GHeal in emergencies<BR>  shaman 3<BR>  GHeal, AC buffs, stat buffs as mana permitted<P>The single most important spell? Tigirs.<BR>Second most important? Tied at Quick and GHeal.<BR>That is the main function of a shaman, slow, haste, and heal. DoTs and DD are some extra damage but not my main spells unless I solo.<BR>Buffs are fluff. The tanks didn't belive me when I said to skip the Dex buffs in favor of heals. They actually thought that the buffs did something. After I told them to look at their max HP before and after the Sta buff they shut up. <BR>If we are the masters of buff then the buffs need to do something. Haste buffs rock, everyone loves haste, 30% haste is hard to argue with. Buff yourself from 90 Str to 145 Str and what do you get? Two more max damage. Not average damage, max. Which you hit a con blue for mabey one out of twenty times.<P>Buffs are crap. If shamen are the masters of buffs then shamen are the masters of crap.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If strength gave 13.4% more damage it would be unbalancing because you are getting that bonus from a cheap, very long duration spell.  It would definitely provide more +% damage per minute per mana than augmentation.<P>Yeah, the enchanter FA just kicks butt, no disputing that.  I don't think spell changes though should be compared to the FA effects, but that is just me.<P>Dex doesn't add anything to ATK.  Zip, zero, not one single point.<P>I don't see how a +% dodge effect could be added to something like an AGI buff.  I could be wrong, but I haven't seen any other spell with an effect like that, so I wonder if it is even possible.<P>Hmmm....can I get my name turned blue now?   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Dwilgar<BR>Luminary of Rallos Zek<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Todays patch was a good start, i just have a couple of comments:<P>1.  Pet-Thank you for finally lowering the mana cost to something reasonable, but the max damage done is still lower than the pre "enhancement" patch (Used to be 53 and is now 51).  This pet is weak enough as is, please return the max damage to 53, it should be 55 anyways, if you were going on a linear upgrade. Also, i hope you are still looking into this, another level or two boost and shaman might actually use this spell in groups, eeeks.<P>2.  Chloroblast/Superior Healing-Wow, chloroblast will not be used until im around 60.  At 55 it heals less than 400hps for 175 mana.   This is an upgrade?  Ugh, please let the clerics know they are way safe.<P>3.  Torrent of Poison-Rain spells no long hit pets  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">, nice job.  Unfortunately this spell fizzles as much as canna III.  Please look into the fizzle rate of this spell.  Its a great spell, but its so unreliable it make it unusable (unless you want to burn half your mana on fizzles).<P>Anyways, nice start, keep up the good work</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Dwilgar, the 13.4% may be "cheap" and long duration, but that would not make it unbalancing.  Think about it, and contrast with the 48%+ enchanter buffs.  A fight finished in 86.6% of the time versus one finished in 52% of the time it would normally take.  In each and every fight, the party with the enchanter buff will sustain only 60% of the damage the the party with the shaman buff sustained.   40% less damage per fight.  40% less mana spent on heals, crowd control and the like.  How much less downtime is that between pulls?  How many more pulls during that 36 minute time period?   <P>You're making a mountain out of a molehill about the duration and mana efficiency, in the great scheme of things, 13.4% for the top of the line strength buff is a joke, and you're trying to paint it to be some sort of immense unbalance.  What has you so conditioned to the idea that buffs must be useless or virtually insignificant or they are "unbalancing"?  There's a lot of ground in between, as proven by already existing spell lines.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
