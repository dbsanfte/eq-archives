</FONT><HR>It seems we're beginning to get to the same conclusion. Monks are looking for a way to be unique as a class and maintain some sort of effective measure to make them attractive to grouping.<P>It looks like its really down to 3 issues.<P>One: Either up damage output give special attacks a stun component<P>Two: Weight, do something about the heavy weapons and armor. Up the weight we can carry or lighten the load.<P>Three: Give monks a unique look and feel , giveing back FD would be a good start. Also some<BR>graphic changes, make the robes well more monkly. Get the designers to watch some good ole fashioned Kung-fu movies, A decent list would be "Master Killer", "Mad Monkey Kung-Fu", "Challenge of the Ninja", and "Twin warriors" these would all lend some background info and at least let you see both hand and weapon forms.<P>Well , that just my obsevations. good hunting all </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I can't help it. I'm determined for Absor's opinion on what people hate me requesting. <P>When the classes are being balanced, I'd like Feign Death nerfed...MORE. More detail is related in the thread "Wishful Monking", but basically it is very out of character to walk up, hit someone, and then fall down and play dead. That is what most monks are used for, what people scream to be good for...but do you really want that to be the defining characteristic of monks? Change FD so that it is based on health. No real chance of success at full health down to the bleeding to death stage, automatic succes. This puts us more in character, and gives room for us to have a better defining characteristic. <P><BR>Let he flames begin.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Usually the planar items are better than regular quested items. I mean Indicolite is better than Crafted, Thorny vine better than Ivy Etched, and so on, with every class. Did you guys forget monks? (well since they dont have quest armor like everyone else, lets just give them complete **** in the planes, they cant argue, it has high stats &lt;&lt; could that be what you were thinking?) Anyway, the one monk quest that does give decent armor is Robe of the Lost Circle, ive already complained about the time this takes, as have others. (But why is this one quest like doing all of the crafted quests 5 times, length wise) the RotLC quest results in a better item than planar gear!!<BR>The Shiverback-Hide is so bad i haven't seen one monk past 50 using it. <P>Another thing, <BR>Indicolite is 10-15 ac more than Crafted<BR>Cobalt(Berserker) is 5-10ac more than Indicolite.<P>Shiverback-Hide is 3ac? more than Cresent(crap) Shiverback-Hide is 4ac less than RotLC. <BR>Silver Moon is 1ac more than RotLC.<P>I have seen Warrior, Rangers, Rogues, Clerics and so on in full sets of planar gear. YET! I have NEVER seen a monk in a full set, in fact i doubt I have seen a monk use even 2 pieces. <P>I think our planar AC should be<P>Shiverback-Hide should be 10ac more than Cresent<BR>Silver Moon should be at least 10-20ac more than Shiverback-Hide<P>Meaning RotLC is 15ac & stats<BR>Shiverback-Hide is 18ac & stats<BR>Silver Moon is around 28-38ac (38 may be a bit high)<P>6) Disciplines<P>And thats the end of that chapter<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Pulling involves a form of range combat, however cowardly monks do it. I think Rangers should be pros at it and casters at least more adept at the close combat fighter we monks are s'posed to be. My idea is heavily scoffed at, true...but that is because you want to be little ubber gods with every twink and advantage you can get.My idea is more accurate, more in character. The way Feign Death is now is quite foolish. And I tell you AGAIN, if they FIX the GLITCH of Feign Death, they will have room to give us something suiting to replace the exploit we have now. Maybe with Feign Death reduced to the escape tactic it's s'posed to be we can get completely unchained specials AND improved damage/skill tables.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Not gonna say I read most of this stuff because I am generally OK with my monk as is, but I would like to see:<P>1. Decrease in reset time on discs like inner flame, void dance, whirlwind, others.<P>2. Decrease weight on some higher end monk items especially the tranquil staff.  Even with the increase to 22 weight cap at lvl 60, it is still a challenge to keep weight below this and, since our AC is already significantly below that of warriors, some relief on our AC would be more balancing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>Kunark has imbalanced the entire game. Where classes were balanced the manner in which “Kunark” was implemented was poorly done and simply ruined some major melee classes.<P>This comparison gives some hard core data on pure melee classes– although some commentary are more based on personal experience, I have played the game since the inception. Some comments are meant to be funny and should be taken as such – there is no intent to flame anyone and when you read it apply the humor where it should be applied.<P>Defense Pre-expansion<P>Monk	Warrior		Rogue<P>230	200		200<P>Expansion<P>252	252		252<P>Increase in skill power.<P>9.6%	26%		26%<P>Compensation <P>Monk - No new armor. Warrior -New insane Ac armor WITH SPELLS. Rogue new uber chain armor with spells.<P>Evaluation:	Substantial decrease in the defense power of the monk without ANY compensation compared to other pure melee classes.<P>What should have happened? A significant increase of the Monk’s Hit points to increase tanking/defense ability. If the regular skills did not go up, the AC, HP, new defense skill or a combination of all three should have taken place.<P><BR>Offense Pre-expansion<P>Monk	Warrior	Rogue<P>230	200	210<P>Expansion<P>252	252	252<P>Increase in skill power.<P>9.6%	26%	20%<P><BR>Monk and Warrior (high level) duel wield items of the same exact same type. Thus, basically producing a warrior with monk like damage with incredible Hit points and AC. Enter the Warrior “God class” of melee. The Rogue getting new weapons and skills having incredible damage output with virtually no penalty. The rogue can solo on a guild events and receive zero damage and still get the kill versus multiple groups of 6. <BR>Expansion - Monks were introduced with high damage “two handed weapons”. There is a reason warriors use duel wielding weapons over “two handed weapons”. (Paladins do about 25% of the damage of a well-equipped duel-wielding warrior). It’s pretty incredulous to place a 2 handed weapon on a class that has always had the premier signature duel wield attack. What were even more unthinkable were monk only weapons that weighed more than steel two-handed weapons.<P>Background – Monks were the “King of Offense” they paid the price with low ac items, low hit points, and a significant weight restriction but were balanced with much higher defense skills to compensate. Post expansion destroyed the balance.<P>Monk weapon/offense skills<P>1st number pre-expansion skill caps. 2nd post expansion skill caps. 3rd number percentage increase.<P>HTH	<BR>240,252, 5%<P>1HB<BR>240, 252, 5%<P>2HB<BR>240,252, 5%<P>Kick<BR>200,250,25% (never used)<P>Tiger Claw<BR>200,225,12.5% (never used)<P>Eagle Strike (Hardly ever used)<BR>200,225,12.5%<P>Dragon punch (Hardly ever used)<BR>200,225,12.5%<P>Flying Kick (Signature special attack)<BR>200,225,12.5% Still trying to understand why our signature attack was only increased to 225 instead they raise kick to 250.

I’m having a very hard time with this one. While warriors are now doing monk like damage with none of the disadvantages they now exceed monks in damage. The only words that come to my mind – Drug Free Work Place saves you money on your Worker’s Compensation. Please consider this option.<P>Rogue weapon/offense skills<P><BR>Archery<BR>200,240,20%<P>Piercing<BR>210,250,19%<P>Throwing<BR>210,250,19%<P>1HS<BR>210,250,19%<P>Back stab<BR>200,230,15%<P>Duel Wield<BR>210,245,16.6%<P>Double Attack<BR>200,245,22.5%<P>As you can see pre-expansion rogues were the second highest damage dealer. After the expansion, not only did they exceed monks damage ability “one” rogue could easily out damage a full group with a couple of monks being in the group.  Although the damage a Rogue can do can’t be seen via this evaluation, the “skill” of back stab is almost to the point of being unbalancing. (NO don’t “nerf” the ability just adjust the other classes.)<P>Monk defense skills<P>Dodge<BR>200,230,15%<P>Block<BR>200,230,15%<P>Disarm<BR>200,200,0% (The most useless skill in the entire game)<P>Riposte<BR>200,225,12.5%<P><BR>Warrior defense skills<P>Dodge<BR>140,175,12.5%<P>Parry<BR>200,230,15%<P>Disarm<BR>200,200,0% (The most useless skill in the entire game)<P>Riposte<BR>200,225,12.5%<P>Rogue<P>Dodge<BR>150,210,40%<P>Parry<BR>200,230,15%<P>Disarm<BR>200,200,0% (The most useless skill in the entire game)<P>Riposte<BR>200,225,12.5%<P>Evade<BR>I don’t have the percentages on this skill. However, it allows the Rogue to do unlimited amounts of damage without every worrying about the “hate list”.  Poor rangers begged for something like this but got a horrible spell version versus a Rogue’s simple click.<BR>Click!!  Hear that? That’s the Ranger hitting the ground dead.<P><BR>Melee classes that need to be fixed is:  Monk, Paladin, SK and Ranger. Even though I did not go into the hybrid versus parent fight, these classes need some significant improvements. Paladins and SK must get a significant improvement on the damage dealing side. Rangers need evade or “gasp” a little more defenses. Its good to have a “Vision” and to make a class offensive and defensive but you have a bad tendency of over applying your “Vision” by giving double, triple and quadruple penalties.<P>Since my post was over looked and none of my suggestions even looked at by power to be – I felt more was needed.<P>My suggestions:<P>Pre-expansion monks could tank but in a different way. We tanked with the use of our superior defense skills via the huge skill gap.  Unfortunately, this was reduced significantly – making the warrior have Monk like – Evasion skills. Warriors needed the extra Hit points to tank, we did not. This statement no longer holds true.<P>Example:<P>Monk		   Warrior			<P>230(1000hps at X)  200	(2000hps at X level)				<P>Expansion<P>252(1000hps at X)  252	(2000hps at X level		<P>It only stands to reason we should be at 2000hps because we now have the SAME defense skill<P>However, this is not the only Defense skill set so lets continue.		<P>Monk		Warrior<BR>Dodge		Dodge<P>200		140<P>Expansion<BR>Dodge		Dodge<P>230		175<P>Since our dodge skill is better we should have a reduction in Hit points. However, lets continue before we attempt this.<P> <P>Obviously Block and Parry are not the same but they do the same thing.

</FONT><HR>I am just curious about our weight restriction and what effect it actually has on our character.. i mean when i wear more than 14pnds it drops my ac (according to my data on my screen i can read 5 ac), now a 15 ac monk piece of armor that weighs 3 pnds would take care of the restriction and add 10 ac is that correct. The other thing is pls explain the nerfs better and the restrictions to me.. i mean i have heard a billion stories about what does what.. and i need hard facts pls.. thanks all<P>Ramsly 40th season monk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Greetings Fellow Monks, (and anyone at verant if ur listening)  I have read through these pages.  Everyone saying the same thing over and over again.  I did not see much point in it all.  I am a monk. So here are my thoughts on all of this.<BR>1. Feign Death. Fine if it doesnt work pulling I dont pull unless theres no one else to do it anyway.  But if I get to the point where it is going bad I once was able to draw the mobs attention for the group to get away and feign to save my own hide.  No more. Now if I decide to save the lives of others it is at my lifes cost. I cannot count how many times the last few weeks I have realized there was danger told the group to run while I deal with the mobs and attempted 3, 4, 5, times even to feign. Never recieving a failed message.. and im not talking about casting mobs either just plain meleeing mobs. That is why I chose to be a monk. To be able to save the lives of others.  Please let me.<BR>2. Upping our offense is going to get us all killed. period.  Every monk who plays this game will tell u that that cant tank.  So please dont get me killed. I do just fine on my own. I dont know where people come of saying they dont do enough damage.  I have to carry a higher delay weapon just to keep the healers in group from having to waste their mana on keeping me alive. Its sad. <BR>3. Up our defense. Up our defense.<BR>Bammin Kaatn<BR>Monk of the Best Kind<BR>Quellious<BR>Long live the GATE</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057050-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057050.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057050-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057050-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057050&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057050&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
