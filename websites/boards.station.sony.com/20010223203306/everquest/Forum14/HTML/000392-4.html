</FONT><HR>basically im happy with what is there, i think i only have a couple issues with all of what is on the list. <P>1. the hammer line, summoning a weapon from your god should be very powerful. maybe it should be along the lines of enchanting an existing 1h blunt (a similer ablility is being talk about on the enchanter board). but my idea is that instead of changeing the cleric summon hammer line, give us summon modulating rod (an allready existing and very useful magician spell). i dont think giving our weapons a proc will be usefull because they are self only and the weapons suck and so does our melee skils. or maybe they could have a powerful proc but then disapear after the effect. another idea is to give them a wisdom stat, this allows us to buff our own wisdom and makes the weapon worth summoning even with the awful dmg/dly.<P>2. standing med---this can easily be argued that it would make the other classes jealous. SO WHAT!! the fact is that the cleric gain thier power thru a god, not thru the power of our minds and meditation. the question should not be "are other classes gonna want this also", it should be "is this gonna over power the cleric?" i dont believe it will. the cleric is not an awsome melee force, not enough that if they are in the fight instead of medding that they will become all powerful. the cleric are bored to death, and this will add some well deserve attraction to the class and bring them up to par on the balance issue. <P>some things i was disapionted to not see on the list was: <BR>1. mana regen issue (every class except the cleric have mana regen).---mod rods would help a little.  standing med would be a nice alternative.<P>2. lack of soloing abiltiy was over looked or ignored completly. (angel form-sow and levitate. self only would help).<P>3. undead only dmg spells should be more powerful (if you are soo specialized at something you should be better at it than anyone-even wizards).<P>4. tashan line--every offensive spell we have is mr based. every mob has high mr, (see a problem here?) i would gladly take the hits of a tash taunt if i could stun that green mob!<P>these thing and more didnt even make the wish list. i really dont think that it is fair that so many of us showed concern on these and more issues that they wernt even considered as wish list ideas.<P>over all i think alot of good will come from the changes that did make it to the the list. i am more happy than upset about the proposed changes. please take another look at the last few though, then i would feel like our opinions were not so looked over.<P>your truely <BR>evolin d'vengence<BR>52cleric rallos zek </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>For you clerics out there asking for some way to increse mana regeneration, consider this.  Your argument is that all the other casters get some way to increse mana regen, so you think we should get it too.  I however think that clerics should be given something that makes them more unique. Standing med would add a new dimention to the cleric class, without adding enough overall power to the class.  Our offensive melee skills should also be raised to allow us to do a bit of damage during combat while we med while standing.  There are disadvantages built into this that will cause it to not be overpowering.  Standing Med should taunt the same as sitting.  Allong with that taunt, there will also be the taunt from our melee damage, and the taunt from our spells.  Instead of worrying about sitting, a cleric will be dealing with balancing our effectivness with our taunt.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan I find it difficult to believe that you have either missed or confused so many of the cleric concerns at this stage in your process.  Additionally, I seriously doubt that any half hearted tuning attempts you and your game design colleagues come up with will make any material improvement in the enjoyment of playing a cleric (which currently sucks at higher levels).<P>What Verant should be addressing is the whole concept of the high level challenge in EQ not wasting their time making pointless tweaks to classes that will end up alienating a significant portion of your customer base in the end.<P>To put it simply:  Verant has tipped the scales too far in favor of melees in the high level game.  Now casters are being forced to adopt totally new strategies of playing once they reach a given level.  Druids and Shaman are now clerics.  Necros are mana pumps.  Magicians and Wizards are useless.  Enchanters cast C2 and haste.  Clerics stand and cast C Heal once every few minutes while spending the rest of their time siting on their backsides.  Umm...Alan high level EQ is unbelievably boring for casters..maybe for all classes.<P>Verant game designers need to go back to the drawing board and redesign the high level game.  Your game designers took the easy way out - they just created high level mobs with massive HPs and complete MR rather than trying to use the gray matter between their ears and designing new challenges.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I like the standing meditation idea.  Will put some fun into the game for clerics.  You know what happens to clerics now that try to have fun and get into battle some?  They don't get groups.  Standing meditation is a good idea, really doesn't give the group room to b**** from a game play standpoint.  From a roleplay standpoint, I always pictured a cleric as more of a master of meditation, and would make sense for me.   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>PLEASE READ!! HASNT BEEN TALKED ABOUT LATELY!<P>What about a fast heal spell like 1 sec 500 HP heal spell post 50.  You can make it a little less effecent, but it would defently be a life saver.  Say you are doing a CH and your bard gets pounded on. Once out of the CH you dont have time to cast another 6 sec spell before he is dead. <P>Maybe you could split it up and have one of these spells early 50's and 1 that is more effecent late 50's. I then this would be a great additation to our healing spells. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I gotta say.. I started a cleric cause  my guild was short clerics and I find it very limiting to be sitting and medding while my group does all of the killing. I think that the standing med idea sounds great but I'd settle for being able to sit and watch my group fight rather than just reading about it in the text window.<P>I also second the idea on changing Lull to Lull Undead and make it like Harmony.

</FONT><HR>I'll say a few things, as it sounds like Alan and the Live Team are ready to shoot them down.<P>1) AC Buffs - Group AC buffs (heck, ANY group buffs) would help reduce downtime a LOT.  Also, at level 52, my group specifically asks me to not use Shield of Words, since it only slows down the game.  The extra +6 AC is not saving *anyone* from death if something goes wrong at our level, where mobs hit for 150+ a hit.<P>2) Standing Meditation - Why are you so against this?  Give it to casters and healers (not hybrids, as they can do melee damage) POST level 50.  Seriously -- how much damage is a level 50 Cleric, Druid, Shaman, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer, Wizard going to do with melee?<P>Keep in mind, we are not asking for the ability to med while *running* -- that would create kiting issues.  So... what is the big harm in allowing us to swing our weapons and hit for 1-5 damage during a battle to increase the fun level?<P>Once again...  only for the melee-pathetic casters and healers... POST 50...  =)  Doesn't sound that bad...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think the whole ghost form idea has some real promise if you look into it. Make this spell similar to the necro Allure of death line. Strong HP loss for a mana regen. Whereas necros are into the undead and have a skeletal form while using this spell; Clerics are spiritualists and take on a ghostly aura and are visible ONLY TO undead. This this a cleric invis spell with a high cost. The HP loss should be higher than the necro line, the mana regen could be as slight as breeze. It would be great if it had a visual affect or even a levi affect, but all that's dreaming and probably overkill, although this would be no better than DMF and would be a SELF ONLY spell. Heck you can even drop the AC of the person by 100 or even better negate the effect of any worn armor. <P>Absor what about this idea is bad?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The cleric population is declining rapidly <BR>with more and more quitting their clerics to play a more fun class <BR>(Rogues and Druids seem to be the most favourable) and only pulling <BR>their Clerics out to res friends and guilds or for plane raids.  This <BR>is the reason that people are having problems getting a Cleric for <BR>their groups nothing else.  Giving better healing to the other classes <BR>just seems a bit shortsighted if you make no improvements to Clerics <BR>also.  All it will mean is the Cleric population will shrink even more <BR>while loads jump ship to play a Druid/Shaman (and the one thing most <BR>servers don,t need is another huge increase in these classes there are <BR>to many in ratio to others as is) and the problem will just reoccur <BR>until such point as you might as well give them exactly the same <BR>healing abilities as clerics and just relegate them us to a non class.<P>As a class we can seem to come across as grumpy sometimes but you have <BR>to understand that we have probably been nerfed more than every other <BR>class in the game and most of our +50 spells are either broken or just <BR>plain useless, put on top of this that we see other classes who can do <BR>it all gain even more abilities and you may be able to see where we are <BR>coming from.  We just want to know that there is light at the end of <BR>the tunnel and you are seriously considering making us more viable to <BR>play and more FUN which is the whole point isn't it?  <P>Thanks for listening<BR>Dolgann<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>To touch on the mana regen issue...<P>Pre 50 clerics didn't need mana regen. In fact, no classes did. Clarity was a luxury that enchanters brought to the group and thus made them desirable.<P>Post 50 things changed. Agro radiuses went up and many areas became undoable without some form of mesmerize. Most importantly, however, we went from 51 to 60 without any increase in mana regeneration. We all cap at 252 at level 51. There is no way to change this without recoding EQ.<P>Where clerics are left stuck is we have no way to compensate for this. Going from 0 mana to full (an average of 2000 mana) takes a good 10+ min. As such, clerics are literally being reduced in effectiveness post 50 because we cannot function normally without some form of Clarity. As much as people complain about clerics being required, it is as true to say that post 50 clerics require an enchanter.<P>Yes, we can still heal. But it becomes very, very hairy. In the end, where skill could once compensate for the lack of mana regen this is no longer true. It often pushes clerics beyond their limits.<P>I believe Verant knows this. All our casting armor and items are geared around manaless casting. The Donal's BP, IMO, was nothing more than a cop out: an option for the highest level clerics to heal without Clarity. A level 51+ cleric can't regen 400 mana in 20 or even 30 seconds. Even worse, they designed mobs around this concept. Even now, there are mobs undoable and, as if it was some final kick to clerics, every mob will forever be in doubt thanks to clerics. People will wonder "Was this designed for the BP?" and they will look at us. And we will simply stand there, unanswering, wondering why we can't heal against the biggest mobs in the game.<P>But I digress... the point is we need compensation for this lack of regen. More so in Velious where mobs hit harder and faster. Do not tie us to the enchanter to do our jobs. Grouping was supposed to make things faster but instead all it has done is assure us we will go out of mana much more quickly.<P>A previous poster said it isn't about roleplay, it's about game balance.They are correct. It IS about balance. No, cleric mana regen doesn't make much roleplay sense but it is badly needed to counterbalance the lack of Meditation upgrades post 50. An out of mana cleric is useless and to function effectively we MUST have an enchanter.<P>Please remove this restriction from us. Please give us SOME form of increased mana regen.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Please add the ability to bind wounds while sitting down. This will allow level 35+ clerics to meditate while bandaging their fellows. Bind wounds is only effective after combat, so the only effect of this is to reduce downtime, which doesn't overbalance game play and increases the fun of all classes.<P>Thank you for considering raising the cap on bind wounds for clerics.<P>Finally, please take a moment to re-consider the stunnability of the divine series. I know that the current thinking is that no spell should be perfect -- everything needs an achilles heal. But aren't the limitations of the spell lasting for only a brief time, having a long recast time, and preventing the cleric from fighting or casting while under its effects limitations enough? No other spell has these combination of limitations. Why saddle it with yet another inconsistent limitation?<P>Thanks again for your attention, Absor.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

This is the Necromancer's domain.  I for one, don't want to step on their toes.  If you do this at all, give it to Necromancers.<P>Fourth:  Why isn't getting stunned while Divine Aura/Barrier on the list.  If we are INVULNERABLE to all spells and physical damage, how is it possible that we can get stunned?  My guess is that Mob melee stuns are a different type that melee hits or spell damage, and these spells, either through an oversight or intentionally, do not make you invulnerable to that.  I think it's a bug.  If Cazic Thule can't DeathTouch me when i'm devined, how it is possible that some greeen mob 20 levels below me can stun me when devined?<P>Fifth:  Why, for the majority of a Cleric's career, must he choose between items with good AC and items with mana or wisdom adds?

Don't make it an Enchanter style pet. If you want to make it more like a DoT, then make it a DoT."<P>Sure we don't need a traditional or watered down traditional pet, but this would be a good opportunity for VI to do something new and unique. <P>"Second: Healing over Time. You only mention the post 50 HoT spells, but i'm wondering why Clerics don't get a smaller version of these spells sooner, say 19, 29, 39, etc... would fill the gaps for those spell circles where we don't get a Direct Healing spell..."<P>No need! Cleric heals up to 50+ are fantastic! cheals for L19 would have to be extremely weak or they'd be way overpowering!<P>"Third: Root or Mez undead. This is the Necromancer's domain. I for one, don't want to step on their toes. If you do this at all, give it to Necromancers."<P>I agree somewhat, but the difference between a cleric and a necro are slime. We're basically two sides of the same coin.<P>"Fourth: Why isn't getting stunned while Divine Aura/Barrier on the list. If we are INVULNERABLE to all spells and physical damage, how is it possible that we can get stunned? My guess is that Mob melee stuns are a different type that melee hits or spell damage, and these spells, either through an oversight or intentionally, do not make you invulnerable to that. I think it's a bug. If Cazic Thule can't DeathTouch me when i'm devined, how it is possible that some greeen mob 20 levels below me can stun me when devined?"<P>Have you ever been to PoH? CT CAN DT you with divine Aura up! DA and DB work fine. Its a little annoying at lower levels, but you'll figure out how to make it work. I rarely use this line of spell to "run away" anymore. Its a fantastic way to reduce agro or to buy time while you mem gate in a bad situation. Its a GREAT spell as is you just need to learn the best uses for it.<P>"Fifth: Why, for the majority of a Cleric's career, must he choose between items with good AC and items with mana or wisdom adds? We are the only healer class that can wear plate, and this doesn't make sense to me."<P>Why is this bad? Clerics at lower level can do both. You can wear AC and be a minitank good healer or wear wis and be a great healer who stays away from combat. Into the 20s and 30s you can get away with this. Have fun with it! Post 40 you'll care very little that you can wear plate. I think clerics are the ONLY class that can wear everything from plate, to chain, to robes! Who else can do that!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have seen some really good ideas, and some that would be nice, but not realistic. I think Jimmette hit it on the nose.<P>As for the "stand up medding" that would be unrealistic, I would be happy with a spell that would give us a mana regen that would stack with clarity like the small regen druids have with their 54ish wolf spell, we are the only casting class with out someway to speed mana regen up by ourselves.<P>Uping the melee would be nice, but I think just increasing our dodge/parry skills would be more practical, that way we can still heal and can live while the tanks taunt the mobs off.<P>Self invis as an effect on armor would be nice.  <P>As for spells, I think group buff spells are great, they save the down time.  When I join a group, I need to redo heroic bond a few times because of some pc's have it on from another cleric, same spell but unless we want to go through dispell and then rebuff (alot more down time) I must recast is as it falls off each player. simple solution let pc's remove beneficial buffs, they can already remove sow, lev and dmf, why not ac and hp buffs?<P>The gate to temple would be nice, but wouldn't help make the class more fun.  Not only that I get a better price on gems in EC than I do in my home town of Felwithe. (thats seems a bit weird)<P>Over all I do love my cleric, but changes do need to be made.  I haven't gotten to the lvl to deal with the MoK spell or pet spell, but I know that many of our spells the cost of cast whether mana or PP, makes them not usefull.  Death Pact, I have used it maybe 10 times, and then it usually fails because of charisma? Don't see why a saved by grace of god has anything to do with charisma.  <P>I would like to see more of the DOT spells to undead, but they need to be more mana and cast time efficient. And the celestial healing spell needs to be able to stack with alot more than it does.<P>Alasia<BR>53 Vicar of Tunare<BR>Bertox</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Clerics are a grouping class.  We need to travel to groups in order to play effectively.  We have no means of travelling safely since a bunch of greenies can beat us to death in no time flat.  <P>Saying that we want Invisibility is misleading, since the whole idea of invisibility doesn't seem to fit well with the idea of a priestly class.  We rather want an ability that allows us to travel more safely through dangerous areas (very important for a class like us that relies so heavily on others).  <P>Instead of invisibility, how about something more like an Aura that acts like Druids Wolf Form and prevents creatures from attacking by evening out the factions.  Everyone becomes indifferent.

</FONT><HR>Reply to Absor<P>Clerics: <P>ITEM: Standing Meditation.<P>Giving clerics this ability will still give clerics the same amount of mana to regained per tick; unlike other priest classes.  How about just giving clerics a +mana per tick bonus bases on level?  <BR>I propose: while sitting/medding add a +4 per tick at 51, +8 mana per tick at 55, and +12 mana per tick at 60.  <BR>I propose: while standing up add a +2 per tick at 51, +4 mana per tick at 55, and +6 mana per tick at 60.<P>Standing up to regain same rate mana as sit/meditate is unbalancing for other classes that needs to sit and med to regain mana.<P>If this will be a discipline/skill, then grat a LOH type of ability that instantly regains mana per time period.<P>---<BR>ITEM: Defense skills.<P>With mobs hitting for ungodly damage at high levels, an increase in defense is in order. <BR>I suggest in the 90% defense rating of Paladins.<BR>100% as Paladin dodge caps.<P>---<BR>ITEM: Bash.<P>Since almost all clerics benefit from using shield + weapon combo, even at level 1, a Bash skill is not unbalancing.<BR>I suggest 90% bash skill cap as Paladins.  And bash skill be available at Level 35 where most of the melee skills start not getting anything new.<P>---<BR>ITEM: Unswerving Hammer of Faith.<P>Yes, this spell is in need of a revue.  What is the intent of having a pet that has very limited control and suicides in the end.<BR>I suggest make it comparable to the mana/damage ratio of Reckoning 250mana for 685 damage at L60.<BR>As it is now, the pet hamemr is 600mana for matbe 20-300 damage, depending on the mob at L54 when it is available.<P>---<BR>ITEM: Stuns.<P>Stun, 35mana 0 damage + stun.<BR>Holy Might 60mana for 60 damage + stun.<BR>Force 90m for 90 damage + stun + knockback.<BR>Sound of Force, L49 120mana for 220 damage + stun  + knockback.<BR>Enforced Reverence, L58, 200mana for 250 damage + stun  + knockback.<BR>Word of Stunning L55, 130?mana AoE stun.<P>In most cases, using low end Stun spell is more effective due to its low mana, and more can be casted since the resist rates on stun line spells are high.<P>I suggest make Enforced Reverence and Word of Stunning use a lure type resist check.<BR>Perhaps modify Enforced Reverence to 150 mana for 250 damage; or 200 mana for 300 damage;<BR>and make the PC/NPC animate a /kneel during it's stunned period.<P>---<BR>ITEM: Bind Wounds.<P>In theory it is necesary.  In practice, the way the game is, medding for mana is better then bind wounds.  This will also require clerics the ability to summon bandages like they can summon food.  This is low priority.<P>---<BR>ITEM: Death Pact / Divine Intervention.<P>Definitely expensive to cast and for the great unknown property of this spells, they are hardly ever used.<BR>Death pact uses pearls (~5pp) and Divine Intervention uses  two emeralds (~12pp each = 24pp).<BR>These take a buff slot, very unpredictable and unreliable to take effect, and interferes with some of the +atk buffs.<P>For DP, I suggest use 1 jasper as oppose to pearls so that clerics already carry these gems for their symbol lines.  Give this a definite 50% to make it a viable spell.<BR>For DI,  I suggest use 2 jaspers as oppose to 2 emeralds so that clerics already carry these gems for their symbol lines.  Give this a 50% chance to CH (at the 35% berzerk mode health) to make it a viable spell for it's 500mana casting and 6 minute duration.<P>---<BR>ITEM: Healing Over Time.<P>I suggest add 'cleanse' effect in Celestial Elixir.  It's original intent was to remove poison and cures.  It should also remove dots because it's a healing spell and a high level 59.<P>---<BR>ITEM: Aegolism.<P>When Symbol of Naltron was available at L57 or 58, clerics rejoiced cause their peridot cost was somewhat lowered by using group symbol.  At L60, a single spell requiring 1 peridot was introduced, and the same financial burden is once again introduced.  A 750 mana buff that takes the spot of hero/symbol/ac buff for a longer duration is good but also hurt versus mobs that dispell.<P>I suggest lower all peridot (10.5 pp) requirements spells to use 6 plat gem (pearls ?) instead.<BR>I would also suggest to trim down Aegolism's mana requirement to 600m (20% reduction).<BR>Aegolism is 3ac less then Hero/Bof.  I have not checked it's HP comparison w/ Hero/Symbol.<P>---<BR>ITEM: Mark of Karn.<P>It's on test, it suppose to be less resistant now.  I am still unlcear of it's healing ability after so many changes to the spell.  Perhaps instead of healing, make it like a mana tap for the casting cleric.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P>---<BR>ITEM: Divine Light.<P>Yes, the fizzle rates on healing spells should be looked at.  We are clerics who heal most of our lives, why do we fizzle so much at high levels?<P>---<BR>ITEM: Heroism/Heroic Bond.<P>Yes, allow the hero/hero bond spell to be refreshed by either spell.<P>---<BR>ITEM: Fortitude.<P>I suggest make the buff equal as Hero but with the long duration.  As it is now, Hero will overwrite Fortitude.<P>---<BR>ITEM: Hammer of Striking and Hammer of Requital.<P>I suggest give a +1 to +3 wis, and +10 to +30 mana on the hammer series.<BR>Also make them in Range/Ammo slots and maybe give us cleric a skill in throwing.<P>---<BR>ITEM: Invisibility (personal only).<P>I know Absor is against this, but there are already items (armor slots) that give invisibility to others.<BR>I suggest just give the spells; otherwise, try these alternate suggestions.<BR>Provide a game item (armor slot effect) that can invis and be usable by clerics and paladins.<BR>Make store bought invis potions stackable, or shaman medicine bag stacable.<P>---<BR>ITEM: Self-only Gate to Temple.<P>I know Absor is against this also.  It is not too late for tis idea.  It is wonderful and can bring in more content via quest.  With the real estate growing large in EverQuest, there needs to be a way for the high level cleric to travel (although limited).<P>Evil clerics already has the ability to obtian the OverThere Gate Hammer which is not available to the 'good' race clerics.<P>I suggest give this spell ability to Level 60 (high priest) or maybe (L55-56 templars).<P>---<BR>ITEM: Lull Spells.<P>See the effet of Wake of Tranquility.<P>---<BR>ITEM: Banishment of Shadows.<P>I suggest lower the gem component to jasper or pearl.<P>---<BR>ITEM: Group Resist Poison.<P>I suggest leave the group resists to druids and shamans and give us clerics the ability to group cure poison, group cure disease, or both in one spell.  <BR>Enchanters have group magic, Druids have group cold and fire, Shamans have group poison and disease.<BR>I would also suggest that clerics get some form of combined resists: <BR>  Protection from Elements: Reists Fire and Cold.<BR>  Protection from Nature: Reists Poison and Disease<BR>And since clerics are purely magical, shouldn't we have a more Magic Resist single buff?<P>---<BR>Sanctume SpiritStone<BR>High Priest of Brell<BR>Knights of Eternal Good<BR>The Rathe, EverQuest</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan,<P>We spoke a bit about these issues at the Fan Faire in Baltimore and I just have a couple of points to make.<P>First off, I remember you making a comment about it being "required" to have a cleric on raids, and that no one class should be so needed in a group or on a raid as to cause this kind of issue.  I think that part of what you are attempting here is great - giving druids and shaman better heal spells will mitigate part of the issues for having clerics being "required" - but you aren't really hitting the root cause of why clerics are perceived that way.  They are mainly needed to perform Rezs.<P>If you look at ways to mitigate downtime, in combat shaman can slow down creatures that are attacking you, debuff them in other ways, etc.  Druids have dots, enchanters can mez (except on 53+ critters, etc), there are a lot of different ways to do this.  If you get into a good group, there are many times the cleric does LITTLE to NO healing AT ALL.  I have been in Sebilis a number of times where I only had to cast remedy once every 3 or 4 mobs and the rest of the time I stood around picking my nose.  The main reason I was there was so that if the pull went bad, and for some reason a couple people went down, I could Rez them back.  So while the changes to druids and shaman will reduce downtime, they still won't reduce the almost number 1 reason clerics are "required" in the high level game.<P>I applaud the efforts to balance this issue, and that is great, but you seem to have missed the point of many of the threads and topics that have been floated on this - Clerics are absolutely the MOST boring class in the game - period.  Clerics are also the LEAST versatile class in the game.<P>One of the reasons people are griping about needing clerics on raids or in groups is because there aren't enough to go around at times.... mainly because it takes a LOT of patience to stick it out to the high levels playing a cleric.  Clerics just are not a hugely thrilling class to play.<P>What I would suggest is that you continue to pursue the issue of balancing the need to have clerics being required as they are, but IN ADDITION please put some emphasis on making clerics more INTERESTING.  In the summary of the items you listed, you dropped many of the requests that people had made to make the class more interesting.  For many people that play clerics, it appears the only thing you are doing is catering to the multitude of druids and shaman who choose to pick a class that is easy to solo and is MUCH more interesting to play than a cleric - by giving them better abilities earlier and making them even MORE desirable to play.<P>I am guessing you will go through this little balancing routine and find that you haven't changed much at all.  Clerics will still be required because they can Rez and you will still have a shortage of clerics because they are boring to play.  Making it so druids and shaman can heal better won't really change the issue that much.<P>Please keep that in mind.<P>Thanks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>i like the idea a faction changing spell instead of invis.  i hadnt heard that idea before today.  <P>the spell would just make everything indifferent, and have a limited duration.  excellent idea instead of invis.<P>would also allow clerics to go some places invis couldnt go, like hiding/sneak for rogues.  the drawback would be that like invis the duration isnt constant.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>To Alan, <BR>        I sincerely hope that giving away one of the clerics best heal spells to other classes will solve the perceived balance issue: the lack of available clerics in the game.  I am again concerned that this will reduce the need for clerics entirely.  A unique ability of a character class generates demand for that member to be added to the group because that class offers value.  Now if all the other classes already have the same or similar abilities then there would be no need for the class at all.<P>This appears to be the final path for clerics based upon the past changes.  Pladins can now cast resurrection so given another year based on the current changes for other spell casting classes, a second or possibly a third class by this point may also have the resurrection ability.<P>I would appreciate it if Verant would simply come out and state that they canceling a class instead of issuing a slow death to the cleric class.  This would save a lot of players invested time, money, and effort placed into a class that is no longer needed.  I do enjoy playing my cleric because they are healers and protectors from the beginning.  I also gain a lot of satisfaction being able to help people and heal them when they are in need.  Making such changes in EQ will obsolete the cleric class all together.  Clerics are difficult class to play and require a lot of patience because of their specialization.  This prompts a lot of players to play a different or easier class.  I also have two other characters that I have played and I was quite surprised with the flexibility that they offered versus playing a cleric.  Clerics pay a very high price for being very specialized in two areas:  Healing and Protecting.<P>Lastly, with all of the new MMRPGs that are coming closer to release I would have believed that Verant would be concerned in maintaining its customer base instead of alienating them and prompting them to move over to another MMRPG.  Many of the new products look very promising and I would image they will have some balance issues as well.  Then again, they have learned from Verants mistakes and produce a very competitive title.  In the end, whichever MMRPG customers pick will assure one thing.  If they are busy playing someone elses game they will certainly not have the time left to play yours<P>PS I have reposted below my original post that was lost during the message board crash.<P>To Alan,<P>Well after thinking about all that is happened I am truly disappointed on the decision that has been made about giving away a class specialty ability to other classes.  Clerics pay a high price for the very few abilities they receive.  Clerics heal and clerics protect.  That is it.  They do not receive any further abilities past those two points.  In comparison other classes have such diversity and offer far more options to a group than a cleric can.  I have played a cleric for well over a year along with a few other classes and the differences are quite striking.<P>I constantly hear discussions about class balance and game balance.  Here is a point:  List all the players that play each class and total them up.  I would not be surprised in the least to find that clerics are the least played class in the game.  Especially if you keep track of all the current - active - clerics and not mule characters used for exp resurrections only.  Another point is that if clerics are such a fantastic class to play, then we would find clerics running all over the place.  Think about it.  How many times have you run by people and notice a cleric in a group or in the area?  Lastly, people tend to play classes that offer the most benefit to both themselves and to the group. This basically translates to class value in Everquest.<P>Now for the sake of true class and game balance where is the balance here?  Please demonstrate to me how clerics fit into this description of balance?<P><BR>What does everyone else thing about this?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

They should fear his dangerous fighting power. The gameplay point here is that warriors have no way of travelling safely among otherwise annoying greens. Where a caster would go invisible, a warrior has to fight off hordes of weak enemies. <P><BR>what about the cleric concerns in the same situation?  throughout history the clergy has been givin a certain space when traveling and retrieving the dead.  allthough this wouldnt be for the same reasons as the warrior, it would be fitting to have and almost fearful respect of a high lvl priest by lower lvl npc's.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Coupla things..<BR>first I saw in casters realm that while MOK was reduced resist wise on test, but I also saw Yaulup IV was reduced in ATK strength. I know the spell is useless and all, but geeze..<P>Next:You know..the argument could be made shamans summon spirits. In general. If a shaman can summon an ancestor, it had dang well be able to summon someone who just died 10 seconds ago ala res ;/<P>It may sound goofy, but to us, I don't think we are even getting a bone. At least..not a very tasty one.  It's almost a feeling of..loss. Our direct heal spells stopped at 54. Why have there been no upgrades at all? In those 6 very NON LINEAR levels, we didn't learn ONE THING about healing (DH). At 59 we learn celestial elixer, a continuation of a different line of spell. But for the prime direct heal spells, they stop at 54.<P>We pay to be the masters of healing. We pay dearly. <BR>Take a long look at what a druid can ACTUALLY DO.  <BR>Heals, Same except CH. (regrowth=CE)<BR>Buffs, we get HP/ac Buffs,and the 5 resists they get DS/ hp/ac buff to a lesser extent, plus the 5 resists, plus group versions of 2 of them.<BR>We have uberkill undead, they have uberkill summoned.<BR>We have nuke, They have better.<BR>We have res, they don't.<BR>They have group ATK buffs, group movement speed buffs. <BR>They have track, forage, etc.<BR>We don't.<BR>We are more durable.<BR>They have dots, teleports, and various utilty spells.<BR>We have PBAE<BR>They have AE AND AE snare for Quadkiting. I don't care what they say, you take a 40's druid, and quadkite in burning woods NP at hornets. Take one up to 56 quadkiting raptors. After 56, it's possible to kite in Skyfire/BW again. <BR>They can solo, we can't.<BR>For every one thing we can do better(not a WHOLE LOT better), they can do to a lesser extent, and sport a plethora of skills. Isn't it time that all that variety stopped paying off? All those skills they have in other areas, should offset what we have in our one area. <BR>To  put it bluntly<BR>Is improved Durability+CH+RES=all that other junk?<BR>In the days of uber monsters, I don't even think Durability is that much of an issue, since your dead if you have 1000 ac or 800. You still have to LIVE to cast divine, and last I checked, with rune V and full buffs, and my uber 1090 AC 60 cleric, I got ownt by Velketor in 2 rounds. Not enough to cast divine Aura. <BR>Reses...you can quite easily just drag to a zone and get a res. Look through the game, look at the people who auction WTB Res, 200 PP. You don't need to be in the group to get a res.<BR>CH-Ah the magic spell. In some ways , this is more trouble then it's worth. I almost want it placed at level 60, just so druids/shaman have nearly no way to complain about levels 39-&gt;59. Egads it sounds terrible, but if CH is what is keeping us from getting even consideration for things, lol.  I'm seeing more and more improvements to druids. I have to start fearing for when is my work not going to mean anything. Look around. There is a reason why resses take more money then ports. It's because it is rarer.<BR>Look at some of the reasons why your buffing druids. So groups don't have to sit around waiting for a cleric. Why are groups sitting around waiting for a cleric? Cuz they are rarer. Why? Because everybody wants one in the group, but nobody wants to play one. <BR>I almost view myself as part of the "Few, the proud, The clerics" Well....with these additions, I think it is "The Fewer, the ignored, the clerics." <P>At least look at all the variety a druid has, compared to a cleric.<P>Notice, this whole thread is on druids vs cleric. Not Druid+Shaman vs cleric. Why? Because there are just as few Shamans as clerics, and they have nearly as few abilities as we do. We have CH, they have Turgur. Those are the only things not shared by any other class.(Worth mentioning. Please..stat buffs..lol). Basically I don't mind Shaman having the same spells the druids on test do now. They have traded alot to be what they are. Druids have traded nothing.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I suggest a skill similar to Mend called Pray.<P>This would work just like the Monk ability but through prayer add mana instead of HP. It would give us that needed boost when we need it the most. For example, a group fights for awhile and right when everyone is LOM someone trains the group. Normally that would mean everyone having to bail out and run to the zone.
