</FONT><HR>I can see why you want to nerf the bp and yes it makes sense. I think as soon as the first one dropped most of the good players out there realized that this BP was stupid move. In fact, I pointed out to my guild that it would be the ultimate lvling tool not to mention the required raid item.<BR>   However, your proposed fix willl shaft many classes. WHy? we have a limited about of room for buffs. IN most situations, we have so many buff options that at the start of a raid there is NO MORE room for buffs. In fact, we have to be very selective about the buffs we recieve so we do not run out of room. this problem is exacerbated with hybrids. AS a ranger, we have thorncoat, call of pred, call of earth, call of flame, strenght or nature. That is 5 buff slots down with only the SELF buffs on us. Throw in speed of shissar, symbol, ac buff, hp/ac buff, strenght, kragg and assume 2 resistences. that is 8 more buffs which brings our grand total to 13 with ALOT of the buffs we like to have left out because we need slot for buffs that depend on the situation. The point, first we are running out of room for buffs. Second, you will FORCE guilds to use more cheese tactics because the only WAY we can get out buffs in will by using ageolism and avatar. If you make this change it will make a mess UNLESS you make the effect buff special such that it DOES not take up a buff slot. If you do not do this, then you need to make avatar and aegolism cost less to cast both in reagents and mana.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am doubtful that I would ever see this BP in my lifetime. I will be the first to admit that I truly hoped to be a cleric with this.<P>Yes, the BP was extremely powerful.  CHeal is the only thing at the moment that separates the clerics from the other healers in the game.<P>I thought, damn that is a BP that everyone would want.  Then I discovered the numbers and realized - I will never own it in my lifetime.<P>Many would ask why?  It is easy -  Spawn times are weekly, +/- server downtime.  So that means at a minimum, 52 drops a real life year, of which, Donal BP might drop 5-7 times during the year.  Figuring the average number of players each night on Fennin is 2500 and only 10% of them MIGHT be clerics, that means 250 players, of which, only 5-7 each year might see this item.<P>My guild has been around since beta, in early 1998.  I have seen items come and go.  Things removed from the game, nerfed, "modified" and etc.  But the thing that eludes me -<P>If my guild isn't umber, then how the hell could I get a BP if only 5-7 of us get it each year?<P>I guess the point is -  If your going to nerf the item, perhaps you would consider making it a more common drop and tradeable.  Then, those of us who never had a chance to begin with, will at least get the chance to see it.<P>Up to this point in my career with this game, of which I have suffered through several characters, I have always believed that every spell and every item had a purpose.  I believed that the BP was extremely powerful, however, the drop rate on it was such it curbed the chances of abuse.<P>I could personally care less if a single cleric and a single warrior can solo something.  Considering how long the levels are at the post 50's, I'd think it is a blessing.  At least now, each of them can do something if nothing else is available.  Prior, neither could really solo into the upper 50's.<P>Often times we forget the reason we play the game.  The game was meant to be fun and exciting.  When it becomes boring, uneventful, hassling, and just plain expected, this is when you lose most of the old players.<P>I truly understand Verant's stance on this.  However, I have played since 1998 averaging 8+ hours a night.  I came back to play the game over and over again until it became a pissing contest between Verant and the players.  Now, I play 3 hours a week.  If all we do is argue and fight about this and that, then all the game will be is "real life" and that's what we try to get away from by playing the game.<P>Go figure.<P>My 3 cents (inflation),<P><BR>Lunamin Silvermoon<BR>GM of OSR<BR>54th Priest of Brell.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Why why why why why.  How can you claim that ths item is so horribly unbalancing?  I Can't use this bp while we fight ANY uber mob or we end up with a pile of dead warriors... the Only time the bp is usefull is post fight healing after mobs like trak and talendor where the players are all DoT'd and all clerics are OOM or when killing a SINGLE mob in OS or KC... you just can't use this thing in an epic encounter or multple pulls so how can this be unbalancing?  This bp gave clerics a reason to keep playing and to be kind to other players in hopes of someday being invited to a trak raid and getting a shot at it... its a motivater a goal something that high level clerics DESPERATLY need to help maintain any intrest whatsoever in the game.  When you raised the casting time to 30 seconds I thought that was fair, in fact it was perfect - you greatly reduced its effectiveness in almost all situations, it was still usefull as a bp off of trak should be but at the same time it wasn't so usefull that i could  solo everything with just me and a warrior.  Can't you see that getting a bp off of a very tuff dragon should make a cleric better?? It should be unbalancing! The cleric or any other class with their breastplate SHOULD BE more desirable. Its just so simple... now your telling us that you are not only going to make the bp have the 30 second cast time but have it leave a buff for 7 and a half minutes on the target... have you thought about this at all? This is so absurd it made me sick to read it when I woke up this morning.. Imagine now I am topping off players before we rush the dragon and at the same time I am overwriting aegolism or something... ***.  Why must verant always over nerf things and why does it seem like its always clerics that get shafted... MoK made clerics fun... clearly made us the best healers as we should be, nerfed to a state that is is now totaly useless, yes totaly.  Legs of stability.. what happened here? Not only are the reduced from a 500 point heal but they now take 15 seconds to cast... why not just one nerf or the other? Now the legs are useless because i can heal and med faster than I can cast them for a measly 100 point heal. Now our kunark bp... the thing every cleric dreams of and works for... useless.<P>Grundie the very upset cleric</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

There are 8 or 9 on Fennin, and how long has SoK been out?  There are less then that on other servers.  A couple of servers have 10 or 12.

And even more importantly, if we do not make this change, the game will have to be changed to compensate for it, and that WILL affect every player all the way down the line. This is what we are trying to avoid<P>right because 300,000 of us have it or group with a cleric who does.<P>&gt;There will already be several warnings, a suspension, and a banning implemented tomorrow over this thread.

</FONT><HR>I'll try to keep this very short and to the point, in hopes that it gets read and thoughtfully considered.<P>1) With a 30 second casting time, I *rarely* use this effect at all. A good cleric simply can not be stuck helpless for 30 seconds at a time.<P>2) The "nerf" you suggest would not be an acceptable alternative in my opinion, unless the casting time were reduced (I suggest 15 seconds). <P>3) A better solution would be to change the effect altogether. This BP should be (and always has been) a cleric's dream. You have stated it never should have had this effect - what effect *should* it have had? Make it the dream item that it should be, but without Complete Heal. <P>I can think of any number of effects that would be drooled for, and yet would not unbalance the game for the 99.9% of clerics who will never see this item. Regeneration of health or mana, invisibility, or even a DD spell come to mind. Perhaps a Lure type Magic nuke for 1000 hp (Divine Reckoning) with a 10 second cast time and a 3 minute recast. Something that would make the item FUN and worth drooling over, but that won't turn the tides in a fight against a lvl 75 dragon.<P>Please, get out of the "nerf" mentality, and make this item what it should have been from the start. That would shurely save you some headaches with buff stacking issues.<P>Raanyar T'Caledor<BR>58 Cleric, Proud wearer of Donal's BP</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I play a lvl 60 Cleric on Solusek Ro, and I have a Donals BP. I'm not real sure what VI is trying to go with this. Do they want people to not be able to accomplish things? Do they want people to quit the game so they will go play EQ2 instead of EQ? I think there is prolly 7-8 donals on our server. They are rare, and hard to get. Much harder to get then the cheesy PoG armor that drops very frequently.  VI also has STATED that Velious uber mobs were made with THIS BP IN MIND.  So are we going to see a nerf of these mobs like Tormax, Yelinak, and Vindicator?  Or was VI's *vision* to have people constantly rezing back and dieing over and over till a mob was dead.(obviously a lame tactic, but the only one that works which is sad) VI really needs to evaluate the game. I hear talk of giving Shamen and druids more heal spells? Thats more unbalancing then a cleric with a BP. Shamen can solo a lvl 54 mob with their epic and bracers, hell why not give them cleric heal spells too. So what will clerics be special for then? Just rezzing and a buff here and there?  Doing this to the Donals BP will severly weaken the game. Instead of having one huge fight, with a few people rezzed back in, now there will be fights where someone dies 5 times or more to defeat the mobs. Dieing 5 times to a mob in the same fight is lame, and not fun at all, I sincerely hope this wasn't VI's plan, I thought you guys were more creative.  The Bp as it is now is only effective if you have a bunch of them(at least to an uber quadding for 850). Only 1 guild per server(mabey) has this ability.  I don't see where one guild per servers actions will "ruin" the game. Sorry we are killing some big uber mobs cause we have spent hundreds of hours preparing for it by killing Trakanon ect. and by killing these mobs we are ruining the game. Thats totally ridiculous, we have worked up to this point and there is no reason to nerf it.<P>Evldor Nomicon<BR>Paradigm</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think Etha-EMarr and Mecoes hit the nail on the head on page one of this thread.<P>1. This breastplate is not overpowered.  It's Complete Healing that's overpowered.  Why should a level 39 spell be the most powerful spell in the game?  39th spells are passed out like candy as procs on weapons.<P>2. The solution is easily exploitable.<BR>Cleric right-clicks the breastplate.<BR>The "buff" is dispelled in any number of ways.<BR>Repeat.<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>&gt;"It really makes no difference if the cleric uses a BP or spell to CH,…"&lt;<BR>Absor responded: "It makes a huge difference. It's called mana. The breastplate is not limited by anything right now but it's 30 second cast time. The cleric is limited by his mana pool."<P>So Absor, you're saying it's impossible for a cleric to get back 400 mana in 30 seconds?  I don't think any rational argument can be made to justify the complete healing spell.  EverQuest will be eternally imbalanced as long as this spell exists.  The fact that it was made into a right-clickable effect on an item demonstrates that VI has absolutely no idea just how imbalancing this spell is.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Adaire<P>Personally I'd prefer to have a 20 sec Divine Light<P>But the current BP casts 30 sec CH. IF they're going to implement this then nothing will change except you can't cast it on the same person for 7.5 minutes. The point is, if they're going ahead with the nerfed CH then they need to reduce the casting time or change the effect because as it is proposed they're going to heap this nerf onto the 30 sec nerf so not only will you be unable to use the BP in combat but you won't be able to recast either.<P>My 2cp... <BR>CHANGE THE EFFECT TO A 20 SECOND DIVINE LIGHT</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm down here on page 11, I hope I get read:<P>What is needed here is logic, not a quick reaction that may prove as unsatisfactory as the first one.<P>Logic:<P>Is the BP overpowered for it's ability to reduce downtime? No, a drop from Trakanon is rare enough, let anyone who can get it have a decent reduction in downtime. It's not even that decent because I can cast my own CH on the tank and a couple Sup Heals for any other characters that need it in less than 30 seconds, and with clarity/bard song I regen the mana quickly enough it's not really missed. Not a big deal.<P>So, the overpowering is the ability to chain cast in combat to keep a fighter alive, as Absor stated.<P>We don't need to weaken the BP, we simply need to prevent its use in chain casting.<P>Absor's proposed solution does this, but costs a buff. Suppose the BP overwrites Aegis (450 mana) or Bulwark (350 mana). The benefits of this spell are lost for 7.5 minutes. Without this spell, the warrior will take more damage than he would with this spell. That means that for 7.5 minutes, our tank takes extra damage and we have to cast our own CH more often to keep him alive. <P>Result: We burn one extra CH because of this extra damage. That means we might as well have just cast our own CH in the first place, then cast one less throughout the fight. In other words, it makes the BP useless. Worse than useless because now we have to recast Bulwark or Aegis (whichever Verant decided to overwrite), thus wasting 350 or 450 mana. CH costs 400 mana to cast, so if I know I have to recast a buff for about the same cost of a CH, I might as well cast CH in the first place and keep the buff. Otherwise we will have less mana because we use the BP.  I guess I'll dust off my chest plate of constant and put it back on.<P>No, logically, this solution does not work.<P>Other solutions that might be viable:<P>1. Up the casting time to 45 seconds? How many cleric/warrior combos out there that are high enough level to get this BP are fighting blue (or higher) mobs that can't kill the warrior in 45 seconds? Answer: None, or very nearly none. We won't like the extra 15 seconds, but it's better than the mini-buff idea.<P>2. Make the BP buff equivalent to the buff it overwrites. If you overwrite Aegis with a tiny worthless buff, we won't use the BP. If you make the BP cast a 7.5-minute Aegis that overwrites the existing Aegis, it may be workable. This may be difficult, because some users of this BP are casting weaker buffs than others are.<P>3. Fix the silly code to implement recast times on items. I write software and I still can't figure out why you have an item that casts a real spell (available to spell casters) but does so in a different way that removes a standard feature of spell caster casting... <P>4. Simply increase the aggro effect of using the BP. If clerics learn that using the BP in a battle will aggro the mob onto the cleric, who will then subsequently die because the tank can't taunt it off fast enough, you will have regulated the BP back to a downtime reducer. I would be 10x happier with this solution than with the proposed 7.5-minute mini-buff.<P>5. Change the heal to a Sup Heal, make it cast in 10 seconds, and then up the stats/saves on it to justify the fact that it drops from Trakanon. This will also turn it into a downtime reducer.<P>I haven't had the time to read all 11 pages on this thread (it's not my job; I hope Absor or his assistants are able to read them all) so there may be more workable solutions out there.<P>Simply put, the proposed solution repairs the damage to the game at the cost of making this item worthless. If you're going to destroy the validity of the item, simply take it out of the game or remake it into something we can use (see point #5 above).<P>Please consider my suggestions, particularly number 4 or 5. Either of these suggestions will meet your needs in reducing the power of the item with a very simple code fix. Easy to program, easy to implement, and leaves us with a BP we will possibly use.<P>Please, I hope you read this far. I hope this logic appeals to you.<P>Thank you for your time.<P>Morodullin<BR>Logical Priest o Brell<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi all-<P>Seems to me that the LEAST the fine folks at verant should deliver is the following:<P>-a *NO SECONDARY NERF* fix to the problem; the 7.5 minute "DoT" they suggest is a cheap n easy fix, not a real one.  Suggest they use some actual creativity instead of merely going for the easiest, ugliest fix this time?  (a-la offhand nerf on mossy twig, etc).  That adds insult to injury.  Don't "nerf" the user AND the recipient of the buff at the same time!  However, given the way verant codes, I'm half suspecting that the effect they propose would make someone debuff-immune... which they'd nerf later I'm sure.<P>-a serious review of ALL the ubermobs both in Kunark *and* Velious.  Will they be killable with regular, non-CH BP groups now?  If not, then nerf THEM down, or fix the linkdead problems so an "appropriate" number of people can participate.  Get rid of the 100k+ hp, 800+ dmg/swing, quad hitting, flurrying, rampaging, enraging mobs aleady.<P>-a promise that SOMEONE there at verant will actually devise a standard metric and guideline for new item creation.  Any person who'd played EQ for any significant amount of time MUST have been able to see this one coming a mile away.  If they aren't capable or don't have time to do this, then I'm sure players would be overjoyed to help- think format like the current "class discussions".<P>Very disappointing; I feel really bad for the folks who will have their BPs nerfed AGAIN, and even worse for the rest of us, who will, as usual, never get to accomplish what they were able to with those BPs, since we didn't get there in time.<P>Seems to be a reoccuring theme doesn't it?<BR>RdT.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree with the above poster.  I think there was really no thought put into this item being released in a live environment.  I can see this argument from both sides...  I do think this item could be overpowered in certain situations... completely overpowered.  In other situations I could see the exact opposite.  The argument you came up with initially Absor is rediculous... now long term it may not be... long term as in years.<P>Let me explain:  With the rate of DB drops from Trak the way it is now... the time it would take to flood the servers with this BP is literraly a year or more.  Then I could say it would be overpowered.. so you say, "hey lets nerf it now, save the hassle"... how about this one, "hey, let's think about the item we make before we make it... so that clerics don't get a dream in their heads that we can smash to even further piss off the customer"... I think the second makes more sense.<P>You create an item, that in the long term is overpowering.... agreed.  I think you should completely remove the effect it has now... remove the CH, it is rediculous to tweak it in any way... more then you already have.  There is NO MOB, that a cleric high enough to get DB, would be able to solo with a warrior... that would not die in under 30 seconds... if they want to run around and test this on lower mobs...woopeeee.  "Hey, it might be beneficial for farming.." what farmers? I thought you were taking care of it...  I say make it something like group Aegolism...with a recast time of 10 minutes, or something... make it still wanted, because as it is now it is worthless... period.  ANYONE can tell you that in a uber setting, fightin big mobs...that a 30 second recast time is rediculous... your party is DEAD in 30 seconds if the cleric is tied up in casting this spell.<P>I think you should remove the item from the game... or make it useful, and not overpowered...  I honestly would rather you just make it like AC 100 with tons of stat buffs...then the way it is now...  put some thought into it... <P>To be honest, the more you nerf items... the more people look down on you, and peopl begin to leave... put thought into things BEFORE hand so there is some semblance of intelligence portrayed to the customer... which is us.<P>Ruarc<BR>46th Cleric of Rodcet Nife<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A question to those of you screaming about this.<P>You say that no one could kill a boss mob with 2 people.<P>Why do you make -everything- about the boss mob?  Do you really think that's all Verant has to consider?<P>Don't you realize that this would be the ULTIMATE powerlevel item from 51 to 60? Virtually riskless exp all the way to 60. You keep talking about worthwhile mobs - is exp alone not worthwhile? Funny, you'll have a hard time convincing me of that, considering how many pure exp groups I see post 50.<P>So, because an uberguild gets one Donal's BP, every lower level melee class in the guild is now entitled to level 60?<P>Oh, and as to another mob jumping in... so what? Unlike OTHER situations without the BP, if something unexpected happens - guess what, the cleric is ALWAYS FM when that unexpected thing happens. Not much unexpected that they can't handle with an FM cleric, is there? If they have a clue, I mean.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>   I know you are going to catch some flak over this one, Absor, but I applaud you guys for this.  This nerf really is necessary, for the reasons Absor stated.  A level 60 SK, paladin, or warrior can tank almost anything for 30 seconds.  That having been said, I do think it's unfortunate that someone didn't catch this in the design stage.  I might suggest that you guys do fewer patches, with more testing for each one.  Just a thought.    <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  <P>   Thanks for coming here and letting everyone know about it, Absor.  Good job.

</FONT><HR>How about they just change the buff to one that is similar to Celestial Healing. The buff will last 10 minutes and can not be refreshed until it wears off after the 10 minutes pass. Every 2 minutes after casting, the buff will cast Complete Heal on the person. This does 2 things. It will give the MOBs 2 minutes to kill a person this buff is on (instead of 30 seconds, is this more acceptable?) AND you can not re-cast it on the same person for another 10 minutes (a step up from the 7.5 minutes you suggested). I feel this would be more balancing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It would seem to me that this should of been a problem that verant would of noticed prior to putting the item in the game.  However, now that the damage has been done changing the item becomes verant's only alternative.<P>If the BP effect can only be used on one person every 7.5 min, I do think the casting time should be reduced to that of a normal Complete Heal spell.  That or even shorter than the Castable Complete Heal spell and then the BP could be used more in an emergency basis.<P>The only other alternative I can see is removing the CH effect of the BP and replacing it with a desirable high level effect that will also save the Cleric mana in the long run.  My suggestion would be to replace the CH effect of the Cleric BP with a spell like Aegolism, which costs the cleirc an excessive ammount of mana if they wish to use it on an entire party.  The BP would then gain a more utility function and less of a combat effective function.  At the same time retaining a high value to clerics with the BP.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think to say that the BP would ruin  EQ the game, is more than just a little melodramatic. I understand the issues and why you would want to fix it, but I have one concern. The fact that it is a buff means that yet another one of our measly 15 buff slots will be used up. The buff limit has become a serious problem and is in many player's view a more serious "ruining" of the game than the Donal's BP that hardly anyone has. It is especially critical for classes such as Rangers and Paladins. Part of our Hybrid benefit is the collection of self-buffs that we have, especially the new Velious ones. Unfortunately, because of the 15-buff limit, we usually end up not being able to use most of these. I believe this to be an unnecessary detriment to those two classes. It does not affect Rogues, Monks, or Warriors very much, since they cannot self-buff. Hybrids on the other hand have had to make several sacrifices to gain their spells, but are punished with the inability to use them in group situations (and group situations are what Verant is stressing and enforcing, especially for melee characters).<P>Is there any way that this limit can be changed?<P>As for the Donal's BP, mayve it's time you changed the code to allow for recast times on weapons, rather than nerf our buff slots even further.<P>If this is not possible, then I would suggest overwriting an existing buff, but make it one that is very  commonly used and provide the exact same stats as those you are replacing. My suggestion would be to overwrite Hero (Heroic Bond) and provide the same bonuses as it gives, or at least something close to it. Heroic Bond would not be as devasting to recast mana-wise for the cleric as something like Shield of Words would be.<P>Still though, i think this will be unpopular to say the least, forcing someone to recast buffs because of a armor piece that is supposed to be beneficial in nature.<P>[b]Moonhawk...[/b]<BR>[i]GL Second Age, CT[/i]<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You know, I've been thinking about this and there's potentially two good things about this change.<P>First, it's obvious some mobs have been designed around this item's existence, which has turned the high level game into a warrior/rogue/cleric-only game.<P>Wizards (and other casters) have been complaining about not doing enough damage to the uber mobs.  Perhaps with this item's effectiveness reduced, the balance will shift a little from melee to back to caster, IF Verant adjusts mobs hit points accordingly.<P>Second, I'm sure other more creative strategies for dealing with uber-mobs will be discovered.  From an intellectual perspective, let's face it, relying upon the bp to melee mobs to death isn't very creative..it's pure hack/slash.<P>Maybe guilds will now even take along some necros on raids to serve as mana batteries, to give their mana to the clerics, zone/camp out and let other necros zone in to provide more mana.  NAH, that's really stretching it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
