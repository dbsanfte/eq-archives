</FONT><HR>"MAges were intended to be a solo class."<P>I heartily disagree.  Magicians are a grouping class that can solo because they do a lot of damage fast, and with a pet can avoid getting hit.  Monks can solo for a similar reason, they do damage fast.  Also given the fact that pets are unreliable in some situations some people will not bother with the mage.<P>Why I think magicians are a grouping class:<P>Magicians lack any form of crowd control, any form of mana regeneration, and any form of travel abilites.  Gate is our only escape ability, and all we have for protection is our pet and a couple of self buffs.  We are meant to get these things from others.  As a warrior must depend on a cleric for healing, a wizard for travel, an enchanter for haste, so must a magician(add clarity from the chanter).<P>Magicians, (pre-50 anyway), have several very group friendly abilities.  Number 1 is fast damage(pet+nukes).  A group with a magician kills stuff much faster.  Number 2 is the emergency(or possibly primary) tank/rooter/stunner in the pet.  Numbers 3 and 4 are the damage shields and resistance debuff.  Finally our summons have utility and are helpful to others.<P>Mages are more powerful in groups.  Groups with a magician are more powerful.  To me that looks like the design of a grouping class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Pure casters in general have been dumped on.  But clearly the one that's gotten the short end of the stick are Magicians.  You say VI only wants to focus on minor balancing issues, but some drastic changes need to be made to EQ.  <P>Magicians and Necromancers are never asked for in groups.  You'll never see anyone shout for them.  It seems  like with the ability to solo you have to lose all usefullness.  <P>also<P>Our strongest nuke, is a bolt spell.

I don't know why VI decided to do this but they did.  But shouldn't the dmg shield still affect the attacker when this occurs?<P>Pets<BR>Druids get a pet..... and they can charm....<BR>I would have to say, magicians are the one class that is totally reliant on one spell line.  <P>If you haven't noticed, our class is made useless by druids.  Its enough to make every magician despise druids.  It enfurates me, why do these nature people get fire spells?  I'm gonna go on my mage on rallos and do nothing but pk druids now, of course I'll probably lose, since they're druids.... wow my anti summoned spell(this is just twisting the knife) line, look the druid is casting it, look fear for my pet, look they're summoning water and food.... and walking around with a charmed pet that could kill my pet... *bursts into tears*<P>Druid: anything you can do I can do better!<P>Magician: I can summon a staff that has charges of see invisable! can you do that!<P>Druid: *giggles* <BR>a Druid begins to cast circle of somewhere you want to be<P>Magician: *camps*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>why can't we simply take control of our pets??  i mean take control like we do with the eye of zomm?    what would be the harm in taking complete control of our pet.    now one way you can work this is that are body will stay somewhere else so that we wouldn't be able to take care of it but also we die if our pet gets killed   thing is our pet should be able to cast any of the spells we have memmed so this would mean that we are in fact in our pets body and are just using him as a temporary host.    <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  wouldn't this be cool?    there are some problems with it for instance does the pet agro stuff a bit more than we do?  yes prolly cuz he is lower level OR would he gain the same level of the mage while he is in our control?   prolly would be a better idea.    but thats my idea and i really thing this would make a mage MUCH more party playable  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Finally solo'd my mage to 52, after seeing the dmg output delt by a wizzy (40) in the guild I was overjoyed at scribing that fire pet... Ran right back out to Trakanon's.. Called me little fire buddy.. expecting this crappy melee, chain casting, tick the mob off, save my butt pet.. I get this little.. thing that runs right up to the mob, casts a few times (gets resisted).. So, I decide well, maybe the mob is mad at the pet now.. so I manuver my butt around a tree, bush, player running by.. so I can cast my bolt spell.. (810 dmg) ACK! pet! get this offa me!! (prays a druid, cleric, shammy, wizzy, enchanter.. someone! will root this thing) LOADING.. PLEASE WAIT..<P>Never.. ever will I use this pet unless something changes dramatically.<P>I have asked time and time again to join in on a raid.. I usually always get the same answer "Well, we really don't have the room, but if we need a back up caster we'll give you a tell, oh, no pets"<P>Sword of runes - Used it frequently  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> (Soloed to 50 in Burning Wood, tore nicely into the bees)<P>Epic.. Umm.. well, if I can't get into a raid because my pet decides to explore on it's own and bring friends back, who in their right mind would want to help me raid a dungeon..<P>Peggy Cloak? Lol 14 hours camping.. finally recieve a tell "It's on track!" I go nuts.. hit me jboots (leave the pet in the dust of course) To find about 10 druids happily blasting the poor thing outta existance.. I of course offer everything including my firstborn for loot rights when the druid stands.. "Sorry just legs" &lt;as he strangly levitates off into the sunset&gt;<P>I think summoned pet weapons with differant procs would be a great idea.. Will add a bit of versatility to our pets. Old summoned items (staff of symbols) Umm.. I think I used it once because I got a "Spare anything for a newby" tell.<BR>Besides the items I summon for myself now (coldstone, food, water) The only item I ever get asked for (strangly enough) is that spinning bottle.. <P>Had ta vent a bit..<P>Ladinar, 52 Magician - Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>i've been closely following this thread, and checking to see if we ever get a reply.  *grins*  it'd be nice to see one.<P>someone earlier mentioned that they couldn't understand why a mage would summon a pair of runeswords for their pet because they looked better than daggers.  well, i'd like to say that i consider it a treat when ever i see a greenie with a rusty scrythe.  summon up a spear of warding, then hand the spear followed by the scythe to Jober and you have a fearsome looking ally *laughs*<P>if verant does ever look into our summons, how about giving the Sword of Runes a new look (i.e a new model) that'll make my pet look that much more styling, cause i see him an awful lot and for my only companion, hes a little dull, not very talkative, and after a while he starts looking a little bland hehe.<P>i'd love to turn into an elemental even for just an illusion. please.<P>i'd die to see some spells from the other elements i claim mastery over.  keep 'em balanced but some variety would be a godsend.  maybe even some realistic effects that keep us "balanced" but would add utility when i'm taking my life in my hands when i consider soloing a blue mob.<P>i'd be a very very very happy mage the day we get some new pet healing spells.  these were great until they became... errrr, worthless.<P>the easy fix to problems with pets is new commands!  and lower level pet only call of the hero. (call of the companion!?!) that brings our only hope against death back to our side.  let me command my pet to focus his attack on a single mob.  give us a command that will let us tell our pet to back off for good.  we really do need something more here, because if the slightest thing goes out of line, enchanter mezes will get broken, my pet will get killed, or something else unfortunate will happen that could have been avoided if my elemental ally could obey more than the simplest, and the least failsafe, commands.<P>make the new commands only be useable by mages of sufficient level.  if i am summoning an elemental from another dimension, dimensions of wind, flame, earth, and water, shouldn't the elder (higher level) elementals be a bit more bright?  someone has to be making a descion or two in the plane of water and ice.<P>someone suggested that mages could summon a campfire that would grant mana and hp regen to anyone who was sitting near it, or something along those lines.  no offense to the poster of this idea, but i thought the campfire was a little cheesy (maybe rangers could do this, since they are at home in the wilderness, supposedly, and trackers/hunters of a sort).  however i had a slightly better idea, that i'd love to share.<P>many mages are clamoring for some means of mana regen, let it be new mod rods or straight out breeze line spell.<BR>--new spell:Summon Dimensional Shift.<BR>mages specialize in conjuring and communicating with extra-dimensional beings and their realms.  this spell would summon a dimensional "shift" around the target.  the mage shifts the location of the target to slightly outside our dimension, where physical properties are slightly altered, but they remain present in Norrath.<P>this is, in other words, a buff.  maybe make it self only if you think it would be unbalancing, but it would grant the target a small damage absorbtion effect(i.e. rune) and mana (and maybe hp too) regeneration.  since the wearer is beyond the plane of norrath, time flows differently and the same amount of meditation could be accomplished in a shorter amount of time.<P>stats are of course up to you, i think level 44 would be good to get this spell... a bit lower if self only.  (since mod rods are of no large use to us, mostly to other characters (and then rarely))<P>--new spell: Conjure Temporal Flux.<P>operating on the same principles as stated above, i'd like to see this as a pet only ac/resists/hp regen maybe even a touch of extra haste? including the fear immunity in this spell would be awesome.  might be wishing for a bit much here, but once i came up with this idea i also came up with lots of neat ideas for it.  hhehe<P>new spell: Continuum Shift.<BR>(here is the campfire idea)<P>cast, this spell would put an effect on the mage that would produce an area of effect mana/hp regen (ala a bard song) and maybe some other useful effects that wouldn't over balance us (haste(slight), ac, resistances, come to mind).<P>in other words, i really like the idea of mages becoming a bit more group friendly, since we are very very easily out soloed by many other classes.  and soloing with a mage is deadly boring.  i love to group compared to soloing something hehe.  i also love that the mage might actually get more use out of all his knowledge of the other planes and dimensions.<P>also, maybe we could get two bind spells, and two gate spells?  that'd be so nice, and you can give them to enchaters too, since they don't have a teleport either hehe.<P>fixing a few problems with pets at higher level would give me a LOT more to look forward to.  hook the fire(wizzie) pet with some deadlier spell, and make it much prefer casting to melee.  make the air pet more monk like, with kicks (i was kicked by a puddle of goo in dalnir, so don't tell me you have any qualms about not giving legless beasties the kick feature *laughs*).  the water pet sounds pretty good, if very very rare.  and maybe give the earth(warrior) pet some more hps, and maybe even a /pet command that would work almost like a discipline?  nothing to make the warriors upset of course *grins* just to give it a little edge.<P>i'd love to see some of the excellent summon items people have been suggesting.  neat items with some marginally useful stats or a proc.  since the spells our pets cast are largely resisted and take away from melee rounds, this might bring us up to par as master of summons and pets, as necro's pets get built in procs.<P>maybe not my ideas, but something has to happen with my, our, class. the Magician. please let me fall in love with my magi again.<P>thanks everyone for speaking and listening.  thanks absor.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm going to refrain from throwing my support behind ideas i feel we need, but I hope that when you see these endless posts saying the same thing, you take them as seriously as we all do.<P>I could tell you of my class envy (druids have ports, heals, buffs, heals, dots, dd, utility, tracking etc), but instead I'll tell you why I chose to play a mage in the first place.<P>I could really care less if we are the number 2 damge dealer, or the number 5 damage dealer (although it seems we were intended to be a damage dealing class).  I am more interested in the idea of being conjurers, and that is what attracted me to the class.  I started my first character as a mage, never really looking more than a spell rank ahead to see what we become other than the guys who can summon cool stuff.  Now I've played this character to level 39, and have found much of the "cool stuff", to be of very limited use (most of it of no use really). Looking ahead I see it gets much worse, where we eventually summon the same low level stuff in quantity. Perhaps from the original concept of the game, these were in balance with the things that a character could get at that level, and perhaps that was to keep our summons from overshadowing the buffs other players could do.  Our summons are clearly inferior to buffs of simliar levels, and that would be ok, if we had a variety of quick one shot tricks at our disposal.  That seems to be our original vision for our summons.  However, we do not have a great deal of flexibility in our summons (few real tricks), and especially when you add into account 2 expansions worth of real gear, and servers old enough that anyone can have pretty good stuff at level 5, I think our summons could use a face lift.  I dare to even suggest that if the concept of no rent was done away with, you would see no real affect on the game as it is now.  Our weapon summons are not very good, and all of our items with effects are with few charges, and so wouldn't last long anyways.  I'd much prefer new better summons that stay no rent, but as you can see that even with thier main restriction taken away, they remain undesirable.<P>I hope that through all of the other posts, someone has the time to read an argument that doesn't read like a laundry list of demands, but I can certainly understand (as I'm sure you can as well)thier desire to have thier concerns recieve as much visibility as possible.  I think we all want our class to be fun (not more summon party packs tho), and fun means being wanted and useful to others.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I feel a great, great need to post here.<P>Things we need:<BR>A better pet heal.  I stopped using the level 20 pet heal at level 34, it just doesn't heal enough.  I like that our pets get a new regen at 39, but I would like to see something like complete heal.<P>Better summons.  I love everfount/cornucopia, coldstone is nice, and rings of flight are just fun..but other then that..blah.  A few resists are nice, but we need more procs.  A weapon that stuns, roots, snares, DD's..whatever...SOMETHING.<P>FIX THE DOTS.  OMG..when I heard about the DoT's I was very happy. I specialize in evoc, and here I get a nice evoc spell.  For those of you who don't know, the level 44 spell originally did 800 damage (everything else the same), and the higher did 1100 (again, everything else the same). This spell will be 100% useful if it is returned to those stats.  <P>Snare.  We don't need root, or stun, or anything like that. We need SNARE.  Verant tells us we are a solo class, and you can't effectively solo without snaring.  Ask a necro, or a druid the first spell they cast on the mob.  SNARE SNARE SNARE SNARE SNARE.<P>Elementalist: Name says it all. We need spells based on all four elements, period.  Our pets don't cut it, we need spells. <P>After 50 - currently my mage is level 41, but I have a very good idea how we are played later in the game.  All the high level mages I know (except the two UBER MAGES on my server) are about to quit.  There is nothing for us after 50, nothing at all. Our nukes are resisted all the time, our pets suck, our summons suck and we are unwanted.  There is no point in playing after 50, we simply become a CotH mule.  No other class is used simply for one spell, and one spell only.  We shine for a whopping three seconds, then we cast our pitiful nukes and hope that one may land.<P>Wanted:<BR>Pet voice/sight graft<BR>JBoot effect (or slightly less)<BR>More party items ^_^<BR>Different pet graphics.<BR>Different pet NAMES.<P><BR>Conclusion:<BR>I have no idea how anyone could possibly consider us balanced at all.  I am a very decently equipped (200 int, 210+ mana, 50+ sv ALL) guy, and I can only solo the bottom three blue cons.  I should be able to take down anything up to my level. If verant wants us not to be able to, give us group friendly spells.  We are THE weakest class in the game after 50, and we are only adequate before 50.  I was hunting LJ in Oasis (revenge) and somebody said I was "the most powerful class in the game", I repeated this in ooc..and was promptly laughed back to freeport.  Nobody respects us, nobody wants us, we are the underdogs.<P>Verant, fix us.  Fix our planar armor, fix our spells, fix our pets..make us the damage dealers we were meant to be.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Some not so random ramblings of a magician:<P>We are the master summoner's of the magical arts.  We summon wonderous items, powerful pets and fearsome elemental nukes to destroy those who dare oppose us.<P><BR>PETS:<BR>Increase the damage, hit points and taunt factor of post 50th level pets.  Don't need to go overboard here, just increase the pets so it is "as strong in relation to mobs, as the post 50th pets were".  <P>In other words, at 29th I was capable of killing a level 29-31st mob solo, but concentrated on low 20's blue mobs for good experience. <P>From 50th to 60th, mobs increase in power by approximately 300%.  Pets don't increase nearly as much.  Fix the disparity.  Fire pets are a joke, and post 50th, they were my favorite pet.<P><BR>SPELLS:<BR>As I increased my power through leveling towards 50th, my spells increased at a commensurate pace on par with the increase in monster ability.  <P>Our spells post 50th do not increase in effectiveness by even close to the 300% the mobs have increased in power.  I beseech you, increase the damage of our spells as well as the mana efficiency, to make them as powerful in relation to the mobs, as the first 50 levels of the class.<P><BR>SUMMONINGS:<BR>It seems other classes can now summon the items which were once the privy to the magician class only.  Summoned daggers, food, water etc..<P>The mage is supposed to be the master of summonings, yet this is not true.  In the first 50 levels of the game, our pet is now the only real summoning of note, mod rods the only exception.<P>The mage as a class is built around the premise of casting now, to obtain something useful later.  We store mana now for future use.  Our pets are the extreme example.  I think additional summons, concentrating on storing mana is a great idea.<P>Give me an improved modulation rod like device.  Stackable to make it useful, without a hit point drain.  To balance it, make it costly in terms of mana ratio.  Costs 400 mana, and will only restore 100 mana; with this kind of ratio, on a no-rent item, the mage is simply storing mana for later use, not creating a hit point to mana item.<P>Let me summon useful items.  Weapons which only pets can use, but which increase their effectiveness.  Procs of elemental type effects.  The proc should be often enough to make the summoning worthwhile, but not overpowering.  Looking for balance, not /godmode on.<P>Let the mages summon damage shield items.  Click this item, and receive a damage shield.  Item costs double the mana of a commensurate level damage shield.  Again, the magician is storing mana for later use, the "purpose" of the class, but the ratio to create the item (double mana) and the fact of no-rent, removes the overpowering aspect in relation to other classes.<P>Some spells in the magician arsenal which would be nice stackable summoned components (as mentioned in the preceding paragraphs), but costing double or more mana as a check/balance, include: Bolt of, Burnout, Malise, Pet CH (costing more mana then a new pet), Rain of, RenewElements/ RenewSummoning, Shock of... The _______ of spells are simply something approximately useful to the level of the summoning.  Make the mana to summon the item more expensive then simply casting the spell.<P>Having a summoned item, capable of summoning an insurance pet would be great for those stints through a hostile area without a pet.  Without a fixed duration invisibility, in a situation where invis is required, mages are worse off then any other caster.  Make an item, with an instant cast time, prohibitive to summon in terms of the mana cost.<P>Pet invisioned as something similar to this: High hit point, high ac pet with an incredible taunt ability.  The pet has no damage dealing capacity, cannot be damage shielded, and suicides should the mob in question be dealt more than a small amount of damage.<P>A higher level mage summoning spell, which removes the no-rent tag on an object and renders the object expendable would be interesting, but I won't hold my breath.<P><BR>MALISE:<BR>Great line of spells which is resisted way too much.  Almost pointless, in that low blues and high greens resist the spell consistenly.<P>Best counter so far, is casting Malise and Malisement so Malosi has a chance to stick.  That's three spell gems used for a single effect, which most of the time is resisted to the point, the fight is almost always ending when the effect sticks.  IE, there is no bonus, the mob is almost dead.  I wasted mana attempting to cast the line when I could have been nuking for some damage inflicted.<P>Great idea, but it doesn't work nearly often enough to be useful.  Drop the resist rates a bit, enough for the spell to consistenly stick on a blue mob at least and it would be useful.<P><BR>NO RENT:<BR>No rent objects should be changed to, until character logs out for 30 or more consecutive minutes.  <P>I can see needing to resummon the pet, which is a pain, but the other summoned items on top of that, from an encounter gone sour with the fearsome Lag~Beast and/or Linkdead~Monster, is merely salt in the wounds.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am a Human, Mage (bad chioce) of the 38 level<P>One day I was travaling invised with no pet though S RO. Since our invis sucks a Ice boned skell saw me and it attacked (or fire boned somthing). With my great running skills I couldnt get that far ahead unless I jumped. It would still be gaining ground on me after jumping. then the bash came stunning me. I turned around and tried to nuke it with my lvl 34 blaze spell. being inturrupted several times. I shouted for help which was completly pointless. I didnt make it to a zone and I didnt have gate memorized so I died. Wondering how a lvl 8 skel killed me when im lvl 38. I got mad and yelled at my guild.<BR>    Im just wondering If mages could get a way to excape death. Since , We are the conjurors could we be able to make a decoy character resembling you that takes mobs aggro and when its killed it whips your aggro list. Which has minimum casting time and minimum hp. If a pet is present while spell is casted have it somewhat like the necro FD .Mages have really nothing to keep them from dieing. Druids have sow ,Rangers snare, nec ,monks, and SK  FD, shamens and wiz have root. CLerics at high levels can rez them self with no worrie of great exp loss, Pallies also to certain degree and have LoH. Wars have massive HP ,Crips. The melee classes dont have to worrie about geting cought off gaurd and all they other pet classes dont have to rely on thier pet to bail them out if they get into troble. And At times when your traveling you dont want to make a new pet in every zone. Or when u get in troble gate 4 (Or however many you traveled) zones back to where u started and start all over. Gate Rarely works also with a huge cast time.<BR>   About the grouping with mages I just spent 2 hours looking for a group in Iceclad,East waste,and Crystal caverns. Only way i could get a group was with guild members. I find that my pet hits the same as the level it is. Normal NPC's seam to hit their level doubled. My pet is a terrible tank and it spends half of the fight casting a spell which always is resisted. I think the earth pets root is a hazard it never works but when the creautures running it holds and the creture turns and fights back kills the pet notices me with low health and comes and kills me.<BR>     Another thing I would like to add is I wanted to try to kill EE's in beholder maze. Upon arriving I summoned a pet I told the pet to attack the EE the first thing the EE did ,which is around lvl 18-24 (i think), is charm my lvl 34 pet no resist or anything. I nuked the EE once and it died my pet came around and killed me. <P>   Can you guys Do somthing to pet resist. They dont resist anything from what I have noticed from fear, charm, dot's. I seam to do everything at the wrong time and im terrible at this game but this stuff make absolutly no sense.<P>Rainbolt Bladestorm<BR>Fennin Ro  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have seen some very good posts from mages listing just about every issue that stands before us.  Thank you to all who posted intelligent, well thought out balances to our class.  I have been playing my mage for what seems like forever and have no twinks as of yet to fall back on.  What I have found is that this class is frustrating and I would never in my right mind pick it again to play.  With that said Verant here is your final chance to bring some creativity and balance back to a class that ABSOLUTELY needs it the most.  If after all this you cannot see that we are the most generic, non-specialized, bastard class of EQ then step into my office.  The items you have designed for us are outclassed in everyway and oftentimes are outright bad.  All of our spells have been co-opted by other classes and we find ourselves not unique in any sense of the word.  Mod rods are crap and its ridiculous we can have only one.  I find my most usefull summons to a group are food/bandages/coldstones.  THATS IT (SoR used to be now useless thanks).  And I summons these just because people are lazy not because they couldn't do it themselves. Im useless to groups.  I went on a Naggy Raid the other day my pet was feared the entire time.  It resisted all my malosi spells, and my nukes (SCREW your DoT's they are useless) all the time.  I did not contribute to that raid one bit, again I thank your lack of vision and the bastardization of this class.  Post 50 i suck, Soloing is next to impossible (oh please make a mage and try and while your at it find a very thick book you will need it.).  I find it difficult to continue because you have already professed that we are balanced and don't see much wrong with us.  Well, this statement only fuels the fire.  Take a long hard look and this class and ask yourselves what went wrong.  Why are this many people unhappy with the class? Count how many mages there are im 100% sure that we are the least picked class.  You have wasted my time and you have stolen my money.  If no real fixes are going to be made to this class you are insulting not only me but everyone who has trusted you to make a game that is fair.  Oh, btw a few new summons is NOT NOT NOT going to cut it.  We need many new summons that are class specific.  We need better pets post 50, How and why do druid's have anti-summoned line spells?  This is what I mean we have spell lines from every other class yet you talk about keep lines class specific.  You are tripping on your own tongue all the time.  We need a form of crowd control.  We need We need We need etc.., Put your tiny brains together in that room and hopefully together you will come out smarter and more knowledgeable about this class because so far you have shown only ignorance.  I still have some faith in you but the outcome will speak the loudest please do not disappoint us anymore we have waited patiently long enough.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is a long post and I apologize in advance for those who have the fortitude to wade through it.<P>Some time ago Abashi made a comment that has stuck in my head since and goes a long way to explaining a number of things about class balance and dependency. In answer to a complaint by a mage that we were the only purecaster class that didn't get some form of mana regeneration, he said that not all classes would get everything. For instance, mages didn't get mana regen and clerics didn't get normal invisibility. I always read the reply(which I paraphrased in any case) to mean that in return for the ability to<BR>do some things each class would have to be unable to do something else. With the exception of necromancers, of course (j/k). This is a sensible course I believe and so I've always thought that the lack of many things mages have wanted such as root, snare, escape spells, etc. were balanced in light of other class abilities. So when Velious came out I looked through the spell lists for the various classes and was sorely disappointed in the mage spells as compared to those for the other pure casters. So I started comparing the<BR>abilities of all the caster classes to see how each benefited or lost. <P>Damage dealing abilities (with my ranking from best to worst)<BR>DD's - all casters get these. WIZ, MAG, ENC, NEC<BR>DoT's - all casters get these except wizards. NEC, ENC, MAG<BR>AoE - all casters get these. WIZ, MAG, ENC, NEC<BR>Damage shields - all caster classes. MAG, ENC, WIZ, NEC (Necro is self<BR>only)<BR>Pets - MAG, NEC, ENC<P>Buffs:<BR>Fire resist buff - MAG, WIZ, <BR>Cold resist buff - MAG, WIZ, NEC<BR>Magic resist buff - ENC<BR>Poison buff - NEC, WIZ<BR>Disease buff - NEC, WIZ<BR>Melee buff - ENC<BR>AC Buff - ENC, NEC<BR>HP buff - ENC<BR>Haste - ENC<P>Debuffs:<BR>Fire debuff - MAG, NEC, WIZ (as a component of a DD spell)<BR>Cold debuff - MAG, WIZ (as a component of a DD spell)<BR>Posion debuff - NEC, MAG<BR>Disease debuff - NEC<BR>Magic debuff - MAG, ENC<BR>Melee Debuff - ENC, NEC<BR>Slow - ENC<P>Combat Assist spells:<BR>Charm - ENC, NEC<BR>Fear - NEC, ENC<BR>Mez - ENC, NEC<BR>Evacs - WIZ<BR>Root - all casters except mages. ENC, NEC, WIZ<BR>Snare - all casters except mages and enchanters. NEC, WIZ<P>Other capabilities: (these may include spells that assist during combat or<BR>while traveling)<BR>Invisibility - all casters. ENC, MAG, NEC, WIZ<BR>Improved invis - all casters except mages. ENC, NEC, WIZ<BR>Invis to undead - all casters except mages. ENC, NEC, WIZ<BR>Shield skins - all casters except mages. ENC, NEC, WIZ<BR>Armor buffs - all casters except wizards. ENC, NEC, MAG<BR>Shielding spells - all casters. ENC, MAG, NEC, WIZ<BR>Mana regen - all casters except mages. ENC, NEC, WIZ<BR>Health regen - all casters except wizards. MAG, ENC, NEC<BR>Levitation - all casters. ENC, WIZ, MAG, NEC<BR>Enduring breath - all casters except wizards. ENC, MAG, NEC<BR>Travel  WIZ<P>Personal protection: Why do so many mages ask for an escape spell? Well it's because we are the weakest class bar none in the game when in melee. Let's look at some numbers: <P>At level 40 I had approximately 750 HP and 440 AC. My shield spell and phantom armor give the following additions: 94HP and 37 AC. This equates to an increase of approximately 12.5% in HP and 8.4% in AC. <BR>Now how about the others?<BR>Magician     +94 HP +12.5% 	+37AC 	+8.4%<BR>Wizard 	     +324HP +43.2% 	+23AC 	+5.2%<BR>Enchanter    +324HP +43.2% 	+40AC 	+9.1%<BR>Necro 	     +324HP +43.2% 	+37AC 	+8.4%<P>I don't know what the actual impact of an increase of 8.4% in AC is - I doubt anyone outside Verant does. Just looking at the actual numbers though I have to say that I'd personally rather have a 43% increase in hit points over the slight increase in AC. Our survivability without a pet is the lowest of any class in the game. Believe me the health regen on the phantom<BR>armor line is a nice addition - but it does not increase my survivability one iota when I'm running for zone with a green beating on me. <P>Finally, mage research: Well what can I say? We're the only class that needs the previous rank's spells to make our new ones and we also have to do chain research. One item I can understand, but both? At one time I liked the fact<BR>that mage research was the hardest of all - it was kind of a mark of distinction. But where is the balance? What do we get in return? Decent mid<BR>level questable mage armor? The Sol Ro stuff is mediocre to outright miserable (Stone Bracelet). And there's only four pieces. <P>Why did I do all this? I like backing up my arguments. Most people know most of this stuff, but even I was surprised when I finished going through the spell lists. <P>So at the end of the day what have we got? From looking at the list its obvious that the mage class is power in the form of damage dealing. Pure and simple.  We have the most difficult research. The lowest personal protection in the game. The most limited buffs of all the<BR>casters. No combat assist spells. No mana regen. No Improved Invisibility. No invis to undead. No shield skins. We do have the second best DD's of the pure casters. We have the best pets. We have the best debuff for assisting casters. We need an enchanter to function even halfway efficiently since we have no form of man regen. We have AoEs which are pretty good but we cant use them unless we have an enchanter. Oh, and when we get to level 56 we get Call of the Hero. Notice I'm<BR>not even listing summons. They have no real impact in the game other than to occasionally eke out another player's supplies so he won't have to go to town in the middle of a camp. <P>Some solutions have been bandied about. Here's mine.<P>Path pathing. Forget it. Id love to see this corrected but its just not realistic to assume that at this late date it can be done. Almost all dungeons are a problem. I just don't think that Verant is going to repath all of these areas - the cost would be too high. And that's not even counting outdoor areas where pets go buggy<BR>like large portions of Lesser Fay. So what can one do? The spell described on Test for summoning the pet is a good start - but it could be available at a lower level. Here's one simple solution. After several bad experiences I<BR>never went back into a dungeon until I got to level 35. Know why? Because I couldn't keep track of my pet while medding. Take the spellbook out for mages from level 4 on. It's just too darn dangerous for us to go into dungeons when we can't see where our pets are for half or more of our time there. And it's not our fault - we didn't design the pathing. This affects us much more than other classes with the possible exception of necros. So it makes life a little easier in the outdoors while soloing. Go back and look at the list above. Is it that unbalancing?<P>Why didn't we get Improved Invisibility? What possible reason is there for mages not to have got this? We don't have any other means of protecting ourselves and our armor/hitpoints just don't measure up to the other classes. Of all the casters, mages should have gotten this spell first. Verant can't even use the class dependency issue since the spell is self only. And no - we do not pull up a pet every time we enter a zone for travel - it will get aggroed on by mobs that wouldn't touch the mage. <P>Maybe it's just because I spend more time reading mage threads than those for other classes, but does it seem like mage items - be they spells or epic quest drops or whatever seem to have the most problems getting put into the game correctly? I don't have a solution for this - but I wish Verant would come up with something. As it is I don't even bother trying quests anymore<BR>till I know that they work. Too much time running around to find out that the quest I'm working on isn't just difficult - it's impossible, because<BR>it's broken.<P>Finally, and I do mean finally. I've read with some interest the other class threads. The one that caught my eye was the one for the enchanters. In it there was some discussion on what could be done so that the enchanter wasn't<BR>a make or break class for some areas in the game. By this I mean that in some areas there is a very high probability that lack of an enchanter will<BR>mean total wipeouts or the inability of people to form viable groups. Rather than nerfing enchanters or the areas that they're so necessary in, why not consider enabling other classes to make effective use of spell lines that normally lie unused. I'm speaking of the AE spells. Many casters and priest classes have at least one line of AE's but they hardly ever get used. Why?<BR>Because for effective use they must be coupled with AE stuns. Any other course is too dangerous. And who has the only line of AE stuns? Enchanters<BR>of course. And naturally, and I can't say I blame them, they are for the most part reluctant to indulge in AE tactics. If given a choice between an AE group and one where the enchanter is mezzing I have to go with the latter. It's just  safer. But if I can't find an enchanter to group<BR>with then I have little option since both sets of tactics are dependent on their presence. If there is one thing I would recommend changing it would be to extend the AE stun lines to another caster class. Naturally I would prefer that mages get it but either wizards or necros would be just as good. Or for that matter any of the priest classes. <P>So that's my two cents. I tend to run on but I've been pondering these issue<BR>for a while.<P>Oh can't resist - one last idea. Why not make Quillmane a summoned creature. Then at least we don't have to drag a ranger or druid along on a very boringcamp to find the dang thing. We can use Sense Summoned to find it ourselves.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have been playing EQ since about september of 2000. Therefor my mage is only level 35.<P>I am not posting to talk about the 50+ mages or areas, althoug from what i hear half of anyones carrer takes place in those levels. I personally feel that i am more than willing to group for the rest of my career. I also feel that mages should get a improved invis spell. as well as root or snare. every class that can cast gets a improved invis and either root or snare. i dont want to hear "you have a pet to take hits and root for you" because it dosnt work... if we are traveling through a sone to go bank or get the hopefully un-needed rez, we cannot travel with a pet because it cannnot see invis, the best we can do is go invis witch almost all the higher level mobs (or the ones im fighting) can see through invis. i have noticed that i will not even attempt to solo anything unless i have at least 10 levels on it, not becasue of aggro creatures, but because the mobs i am fighting hit too hard, my et cannot root, i have no escape, and my pet has (comparatevly) no HP. on a side note, the only things that are absolutly nessesary are tank/cleric/wizard. I can live with that, where i fight i always see shouts gouing out for those classes. among that i see groups looking for shamans/druids/bards/ and more tanks. the only time i can get into a group is if i am playing with guild mates and RL friends. other than that i can only get into a group if someone is "looking for more" or wanting " to round out the group".<P>sorry for the long post but i think the only thing i need as a mage right now is either root/snare, or to have my pets acually be able to root and a improved invis spell.<P>thanks for the time you have spent reading this post.<P>A soon to be dust collecting mage.<BR>Uprising 35 Tarrew Marr.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Was wonderin if our pet's are given some of the exp on each kill, then why do they not become stronger as we continue to play the same pet.  I know I have played my mag for 8+ hours or more with the same pet and have leveled my charr but my pet still dished out the same dmg as I first casted him... Where did this exp go? What purpose is being achived in givin it to the pet? If in fact the pet does get exp when it fights for my charr, it stands to  reason that it should become stronger in time to the point that it may become stronger than it's master.. Now that would really be cool to get a really good pet, take good care of him (with better healing spells) as he defends you and in time he could allow you to take on higher lvl mob's so that the both of you could help in  group's (with better pet control and pathing) or in solo play.<P>Another thought would be that when you had a pet that you really did care for and took care of and was able to attend to more of his needs as one would do with a real pet in real life, then with this extra care your pet would grow in strengh and abilities that would make him more useful to you in time as it grows and is taught new abilities. Would also be nice, if at some point this pet could become special and be recasted at a later time in gameplay and could also be rez'ed if it died just as others in your group can, because you might have devoted a large amount of time in molding your special pet for the purposes and abilities that you might need from that pet, as you could have more that one special pet for different encounters. This would give our class that possible edge that we need for groupin and for some of the other issues that have been posted in this discussion about the mag class.<P>just a thought  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ummm... my pet can only hear my commands from about the same distance that a gnome can spit.  Please increase the range upon which my pet can recieve commands.<BR>  Absor, if we're so balanced after lvl 50, will you please consider looking at some numbers post 55? I'm willing to bet that there are SIGNIFICANTLY less mages post 55 than ANY other class out there.  Doesn't that say anything that might be relative to "class balance"?<BR>  PLEASE GIVE US AN ESCAPE SPELL... preferably one that takes less than 5 seconds to cast (gate), and one that doesn't take us back to our bind point (gate), and one that won't have us begging for another ride (guess).  BTW- despite all the crys for Improved Inviz, which are well founded, this will NOT solve the escape spell problem.  A lot of mobs these days see inviz, and i'm sick of dying to them.  Not to mention how utterly helpless we are if we die.  A naked mage has NO defense against anything unless it's at LEAST 30-35 levels under him.  If i'm bound at KC and have to run to DL portal for a ride... well, it's a crap shoot, considering my jboots are on corpse, and i have to pray nothing agros.<BR>   Honestly, how would it overpower us to give us a root/snare type spell?  For the love of all that's holy, we are the ONLY casting class without a root/snare line... let me list them for ya: Wizard, Enchanter, Necro, Ranger, Paladin, Cleric, SK, Shaman, Druid, hell, even Bards.  Rogue's can poison a crap weapon with a snare effect to escape a tough situation.  Monks can FD. The ONLY class that might have trouble getting out of a bind is warrior... and they certainly aren't going to panic when a green mob sees them. Mage's are the ONLY class that have NO chance of escaping a tough spot without casting, you guessed it, gate.  <BR>  I'm sorry, but bad stuff happens to me and I die sometimes... once this happens, I'm pretty much defenseless since my main line of defense is my pet, and they require reagents.  Just give us a snare/root kind of spell... it will NOT make us over-powered. <BR>   Cronik - 51 Elementalist of RZ <BR>Sick of dying to see-inviz greenies, or having to gate from them (sad when I pray that I can gate from a green mob before it kills me)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok heres my 2 cp:<P>1. Our pets are our lives. It seems that they lost some of their taunt power in a past patch cause they taunt a lot less now. Also I am sick of summoning pet after pet just to get one thats not GREEN. Also we should be able to invis our pets so we dont have to fight through about 10 levels of green trash trying to get to the place we want to hunt. I mean the only reason you took this away was cause people who could charm large Mobs would charm them and invis them letting them kill people at random. Please fix this some other way so we can invis our pets again.<P>2. Our summonings people should want. Nobody really wants a 2hb staff that has one charge of dispel magic and weighs 8.5 pounds. Some new proccing weapons would be great, Also some other things maybe a little earlier: ring of flight a step down maybe?  <P>3. The new changes on test - <BR>  A. adding a pet jboot buff- good idea, i hated the fact my pet took forever to follow me while i had sow and i couldnt find him when some mob decided to jump him. <BR>  B. Pet fear immunity spell- good idea, bad placement. Comes WAY too late in game. By the time we get 59 we should have been in many situations were our pets are feared (heck it even happens pre-planes levels) So this spell should be a LOT lower. <BR>  <BR>4. Epic weapon is very hard to get. We need to get multiple planes drops and also a couple other things that are very hard to get. (pegasus cloak)<P>5. I'm sick of looking at higher level armor and finding no useable right click effects. Lets just say all mages should be sick of seeing reclaim energy on anything. Focus items yeah, but on the mastery staves? Please change this. Please give us something useful.<P>6. Mana regen - ok why does every other int caster get at least a DECENT form of mana regen and we dont? Ok they all have their drawbacks, but ours is the worst drawback. 200 mana to summon and we only get 150 back? plus the fact it takes 225 life from us? um i know for a fact if i really needed to use one of these things my pet is almost dead and so am i. Plus i know most of the mages who make 44 do not have a lot of hps to get rid of. Please look into this.<P>Sigh i know im missing things and might not have said them as eloquently as other people, but i know we need to be made mages again. <P>Thank you<BR>Kanien<BR>37th level Magician</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>i agree mages are pretty much perfectly balanced between solo, grouping, and raids. sure, we're a bit behind in some areas. a bit ahead in others. i think it all evens out. pets seem alright the way they are, anyone who gripes about them just doesn't know to handle their pet right. at 55 i've never had any problems with my pets except the occasional zone pathing problems. a few things that could use some work though...<P>spells:<BR>muzzle of mardu<BR>burnout IV<P>these strike me as being two spells which are some of the better spells we have to look forward to post 50. while i am NOT suggesting they drop like acumen or pillar of lightning, a think a bit of an increase in their drop rate is warrented. these are the only two spells i haven't even seen for auction or drop not ONCE in 4 months of searching for them (well 4 months of mardu, and since vel came out for butnout IV)<P>DD spells:<BR>shock of steel line could REALLY use a cast time decrease. that would up its usefullness to match some of the bigger hitting evoc based spells we get. having our only conjure based nukes be 6.1 cast time is just limiting and frustrating. something along the lines of 4.5 (like char) would make the shock line much more viable post 52 and it a usable option instead of just char<P>pets:<BR>i wouldn't mind seeing something along the lines of discipline-esque pet buffs. for example a pet 10 second invulnerability buff or something. make the spell low mana, low cast time, but have an hour recycle timer or something, like the warrior discipline<P>the spell drops and cast times are the two things i think are the only vital changes needed to what is overwise one of the better made classes in the game</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> I like all the ideas. I think we should be able to turn into an elemental. We should have a Mana regain and some kind of Crowd control..I hope vernat reads all of your post. Remember how people use to say Bards "were the jack of all trades but master of none"? well, this seems to go better with the Mage class ecept it would be "Jack of SOME trades but master of none"..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Okay, I agree with about 90% of the needs and wants of the other mages here.  I have also created 3 other characters.  One of which I have twinked.<P>The one thing I would like to add as a wish list is something to help us solo like all other classes can.  I wish to have 50+ earth pets with snare instead of root with a low resistance to it as well.  This would be ideal.  I think this would be a wonderful change and welcome by all.  <P>Please consider these great ideas from us mages and actually consider them instead of considering them rants and blowing them out of the water.<P>Aedriana (18 Enchanter)<BR>Perdonious Starbringer (51 Elementalist)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The fact that we have the Malo line of resistance reducing spells has been mentioned several times as a benefit of the mage class.  However, they get resisted very often!  My 51 mage has Malosi, an upgraded, more powerful version of Malaise...right?<P>Wrong! In Skyshrine I cast Malosi on wyverns and wurms 15 times, once 4 times on the same wyvern. It was resisted EVERY time! I finally decided that trying to cast it was a waste of mana.  These mobs conned blue to me, but they resisted every Malosi attempt!  Sounds to me like something that needs to be looked at. )<P>Yalwendin Soulsearcher<BR>51 Mage, Emissaries of Dread<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First, I want to join in the chorus of "Thank yous" among those who appreciate that Verant is working to engage in feedback from people playing their classes.  And I recognize that not everyone will agree on possible fine tunings.<P>Let me add that I dont feel the need to say another class should have something taken away just take make Mages more desirable.  Nor do we need alternate vectors of attack (DOTs, cold, wind, etc) if indeed our own vectors of attack can be made to be a touch more friendly to the caster.  We would appreciate a role, as do all pure casters, in being able to deal some damage to the large boss mobs that currently really only seek tanks and tank support.  <P>Nor in general do pets need too much work, except A) certain low level pets such as fire and air which are too fragile to use and B) post-50 pets which are also too fragile to use and C) the ever-important issue of control to where having pets would become a desirable thing.<P>In this post I wish to address only one line of spells, our summonings.<P>Summons:  This line is one of the ones that we rather hope can make us most valued in a group.  However, none of the things we summon are of good quality by the time we summon them; the post-50 quiver of Marr arrows are great, but for whom? People love our waterstones, for the two or three rare times they desire them. Coldstones are desirable to races with poor vision.  Some spells would be wonderful bumped down a spell ranking; the inclusion of early magical 1hb would be appropriate and is a gaping hole; the fact that the norent status on bags makes them effectively unwanted nullifies what would otherwise be a useful line of spells.  And, of course, shard of the core has been appropriately castigated as needing to be in both range or ammo slot, and possibly tradable.  In addition to the changes proposed what about:<P>1. Summon Sewing kit; jewelers kit; portable oven, etc; These mid-range spalls would summon norent equivalents to tradeskill kits.  This would make the magician seen as a more valuable companion during downtime while people med.<P>2. Summon functional NPC: Summon baker, bartender, summon merchant, summon banker.  A line of spells that would briefly summon an immobile NPC who functioned as a merchant or banker.  After all, since astral projections can come into the world to do commerce, why not summon these commercial beings to do trade with the people of Norrath.  The bonuses would be enormous: Most people who wont hunt certain areas frequently because of their remoteness would be more likely to do so if they had these resources available to them.  Further, since these NPC merchants would vanish after being dismissed (and they would take the place of a mages pet slot, so a mage would have to unsummon their pet to bring one in), this would help the economy of Norrath from not constantly being flooded; any items sold to these ethereal merchants would be taken out of the game.  <P>3. You shall not evade me! : Obviously a spell in the game: why not have it that if a monster is aggroed, the mage might be able to cast a spell with a low casting time (but high recycle time) that would pull the monster back to them? It would be a different type of crowd control than root or snare; as the monster would be on top of the magician. It would not replace a puller, as the monster not only would have to be targeted by the magician but also already have to have the magician on their hate list. Since call of the hero has become a new post-50 mage spell that makes them desirable in groups, lower levels surely could benefit from the abilityt o bring back a monster that flees or warps.  Since magic resist always plays a role, such a line of spells would never be too overpowered as it would require a higher level spell to effectively summon such a creature back.<P><BR>Father Azerun<BR>Gatecaller<BR>Guildleader, Hand of Mana, Nameless Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>After having swam by a 55th druid in Timorous last night, and watched him kite FOUR RAPTORS, I'm considering hanging up my robe.<P>"it's hard to find anything wrong with the balance of this class"<P>I've come to what seems an inescapable conclusion, at least to me : the folks in charge of "game vision" and "class balance" at VI have got their heads firmly planted in a daisy chain, up each other's hind ends.  I simply can't explain any other way how magicians get shoveled under the rug while things like this go on.  <P>I'm quite possibly going to hang up this game, but we'll see how the life of a Bard treats me.  Or maybe I'll find what class it is that the VI guys play - at least then I'll know someone is watching and actually has a clue as to what is or isn't wrong with that class.<P>Jeez.  I still can't believe this.
