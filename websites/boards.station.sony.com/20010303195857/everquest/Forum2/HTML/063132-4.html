</FONT><HR> I read more boards than just this one, and they all pretty much read the same. Getting rid of this board is going to do nothing cept force people to post their rants on other boards. <P> As a customer, I'll admit that their are times where I feel very let down( whenever I have to petition is normally one of them). There are also times where things are incredible too. <P>  My overall opinion of Verant in this game is that they do not test things as well as they should. Its more than that though, it seems that some 'class groups' get more attention than others. This isn't about class jealousy, its about relatively equal tasks producing different rewards for different classes. Perhaps the people who are assigned to overlook the development of each class would primarily play that class too? <P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Xelene-<P>good point.  It is the opposite look I take of it, but it's valid and true.  The difference is, if they do treat it as you say..is that healthy for their pocket book in the end?  Verant has gone out of its way in the beginning of this game to create this virtual on-line experience..they WANT you to be in their world, they WANT it to be a virtual community.  It is their whole reason for requiring grouping.  They are doing everything they can to make this society.  But what about the hangups that go with it?  Yeah, if threads get deleted and someone tries to bring them up on charges for abusing peoples rights it will be thrown out and laughed at.  But if you want a virtual world and a virtual society, you're not going to be able to cut out the pieces you don't want to look at.  If you look at the issue from inside, the players should have expression and should have a voice.  If however Verant is not truely after creating their virtual world, they should back off the social dynamics, let it drop, kill the boards and become a game company with a game.<P>Tinywulf of Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Manglosh, you only mention the cost of maintaining the message board. You neglect to mention the benifets of the message board. Right now, while typing this post i notice a VISA banner. That is income lost if the message board is axed. Also, there is benefit to other sony/verant products that people notice because they come to this site to see the message board. If the message boards are done away with, this site will see ALOT less traffic. Meaning alot less advertising revenue and alot less people noticing other Verant/Sony products and services. You seem absolutely sure that the costs of maintaining this board outweigh the benifits that this board brings in. I am not as sure as you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Who's fault is the negativity? I think it is impossible to have _ANY_ type of communication with such a large customer base, and not have a certain amount of negativity come back at you from the customer base.<P>A customer becomes negative when they have had a bad time with the service offered. Are you saying that no one has a right to express negative feelings about the service? <P>I would submit that the vast amount of the negative feelings shown towards VI from customers is the fault of VI itself. Now, rather the customer is right or not to be in a negative mood, does not matter. They are in a negative mood, and they are in that mood due to perceptions made through gameplay or board interaction, IRT VI. People need a means of venting, it is good for the mental health of the individual.<P>It seems to me, that VI thinks everyone should bottle-up their emotions before engaging them. Well, if I want to vent my negativity at them, which was casued by their game, which we all _pay_ for, then they just need to get some thicker skins. I don't care one wit if their feelings get hurt, tough luck, that's business.<P>One time, when I was a pup, and was working for Best Buy, and was behind the CS counter, I had a woman come in, toss a Disney video at me, and started cursing at me about it being the Nth time she had returned one of these videos as defective. I mean she was mad, and flinging vitriol and curses at the top of her lungs, and I had never assisted her before. Did we ban her from the store, not hardly. We appologized, reasoned with, and resolved the problem. If you don't want to deal with upset customers, then don't go into business. These people deserve no excess of respect. They have no reason to expect thier customers to behave any better than any other customer from a different consumer market.<P>They do things which cause mistrust and bad feelings, and then expect everyone else to swallow their pride and treat them with deference. Bah, I say. I have no respect for VI, as a matter of fact I am pretty contemptuous of them.<P>It is a little late to come begging for constructive critisism, when all along they have been disrespectfull, rude and dismissive of their customers.<P>Alaranth<P>"A prohibition law strikes a blow at the very principles upon which our government was founded."<P>Abraham Lincoln - 1840<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OK..interesting topic...have had a few thoughts of my own along related lines:<P>1)  Is the board useful ...yes<P>2)  Is it severerly flawed..also yes.<P>Before I suggest improvements, let me point out a few observations.<P>a)  Many threads start out with calm, civil comments describing a problem of some sort, for example with a game mechanic or some other feature of the game.  The thread might strike a chord with the rest of the community and attracts attention.  But, somewhere around page three or four, the posts start to get nasty as the posters begin to feel as though Verant is uninterested in their opinion.<P>b)  Expressing you opinion (in general, not just on this board) generally improves peoples attitude BUT being ignored makes it worse.  <P>c)  The General Discussion board has so many topics, etc that two hour old posts are already on page 4.<P>What does all this mean for the usefulness of this board.<BR> <BR>1)  Split the general discussion board into three other boards (goal....a post requesting information or assistance should persist at least 12 hours on a given page...more splits may be needed).<P>  a)  Discussin of game mechanics (i.e.  Healing aggro, stat buffs, /lastword command, etc)<P>  b)  Questions and Discussions for the everquest community -no response expected from Verant (i.e. What happened when..., What should I play...., How to...)<P>  c)  Requests for input (threads in this area will be started by 'blue names' when they want input into a specific topic..i.e. the iksar quest threads, the class talk threads, the one you should have started on healing, the one you  should start following every major patch to get input on the changes, etc).<P>2)  READ the threads in boards one and three on a daily basis, and POST.  I dont mean make a careful response to each post in the thread..but just a ...I have read this thread and am considering the issues mentioned...would do wonders to convince the EQ community (righly or wrongly) that you are reading and listening to their concerns.  Because if you DONT post, we feel ignored and get upset.  But if you DO post, we get the feeling that we are being listened to.<P><BR> <BR>Note:  Some of this is based on the assumption that you are actually concerned with input from the gaming community on how to improve your game (and I dont mean catering to the whims of every player, but rather listening to valid concerns and making adjustments to increase the enjoyment and quality of the game).  Of course, if not....pretending to listen to our concerns through more frequent posts (Absor has responded to maybe three or four posts in two weeks (not counting warnings and thread lockdowns/ splits)...will still do wonders for customer morale.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I can see it from both perspectives:<P>Pros:<BR>The board provides valuable feedback and brings items to Verant's attention much quicker than any in-game mechanism could.<P>Makes the Customers feel like it is "their game".  Customers who feel they have input have more of a reason to keep playing.<P>Helps with getting information out to the customers.<P>Cons:<BR>Amplifies in-game problems.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> (may make someone who doesn't really SEE a problem, start to notice things, or care about things that aren't even affecting him)<P>Too much negativity.<P>Too much "fluff" not enough "meat".  So many posts push stuff off the first page WAY too fast.<P>--------------------------------------<P>All in all, I think it's a good thing to have this board.  Suggestions I would make to improve the benefits and remove the negatives:<P>1) Remove customers ability to start a thread, customers can only reply to pre-existing threads.<BR>2) Create a way for players to submit topics for discussion (aka Heal/Hate/Agro) through a source not seen by the public. (people won't submit as much if their name isn't right there on the message, aka remove trolls)<BR>3) Have a staff of Verant employees who sift through these suggestions and post a thread for "hot topics". (3-5 people at $10/hr rate).<BR>4) Delete inflamatory posts within active threads (# of active threads should be around 30)<BR>5) Verant should monitor these threads throughout the day and add feedback as the day progresses.<BR>6) Leave other areas of the board for "player chat" similar to the server/class/tradeskills forums, which are not monitored at all (therefore players don't EXPECT a response from Verant here) aka GrollerDaBard threads  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Oh well, this suggestion will proly get lost, but there it is anyways, do with it as you will.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hehe, I hate this Board (the General Discussion one i.e. Whineplay) but come to read the Newbie Zone all the time.  It is one of the way to get or give information about the game.<P>However, I will admit to being addicted to the General Discussion Board.  It has the same attraction that an accident on the side of the road has to most people that slow down to look at it.  Interestingly enough, it has been theorized that the reason why people slow down on the road to look at an accident has to do with evolution, it is our way of learning to survive.  By looking at someone who didn't (and learning from other's mistakes), we are increasing our chances of survival.<P>Joking aside, I come to this Board regularly to see what the most recent problems are and the solutions that are offered by the players.  I avoid the class envy posts and the class bashers posts as much as possible.<P>Different types of industries have different ways of having consumer feedbacks.  Some industries use a sample audience to view their products and comment.  This is not really possible in the case of Everquest because of the nature of the product and the sheer amount of bugs and errors that may occur.  Therefore, the nature of the product and the clients make it such that the Board are a primary mean of communication.<P>Why are the boards needed?  Verant needs these boards because it needs to know how it consumers feel.  Every company needs to know that information.  It is not when the consumers are gone that the information becomes apparent.  Any company needs consumer feedback BEFORE the consumers are gone.  <P>On the other hand, the board is a somewhat limited way of obtaining information since, by its very nature, it attracts only a limited number of people.  I would be surprised to see what percentages of posts are made by the same people who just reply to each other (some sort of weird incestuous relationship where the same people are talking to each other over and over).<P>For that matter, WHO is posting is as important as what the posters have to say.  Again, as long as the same people are talking to each other, the matter may be ignored.  It is when new names start appearing that the issue becomes important.  During the Vietnam war in the USA, people were keeping an eye on the demographic composition of the protesters.  The Government started getting worried when it discovered that the composition of the marchers had changed and that people who usually do not complained had started protesting.<P>I suggest that the number of posts is irrelevant to the importance of a subject but that who is posting is not.<P>By their very nature the boards will be negative (unless you are talking about TNZ) since happy people don't post.  It requires a very thick skin to be able to talk to those who are always negative (maybe you should hire a former politician who is used to receiving angry letters from constituents  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> and is able to extract the useful information out of the mud).  <P>Fanelaine Celebehl</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"Alchemy and Poison stand out most here. These two things were broken for literally months."<P>Who is to say that Verant was not actually working on much deeper/larger bugs or problems at the time, and their attention was dragged away from that project by the huge amount of whining over this issue. Thus leaving another more critical part of the game unfixed.<P>I think Verant has enough smart people to prioritize their projects. Having mass mob mentality, jump on the bandwagon of the week, board discussions that DEMAND they fix this or that issue, just makes it so they can not focus on what they KNOW is more important.<P>Yes, if enough people scream they will respond, but at what expense id what most people here do not understand. That and then Verant gets all these "Well why wasn't THAT fixed months ago" posts, well the reason is, because YOU dragged their attention away from it.<P>I fully expect that a Quad-Kiting "fix" has consumed enough resources at Verant that all those pathing problems you have, new zones you want implemented and other GAME ENHANCING features will be bumped well out further than they should be so they can "Appease The Mobs".<P>Think about it.<P>I for one could care less if druids can quad kite if it gets me 4 new zones to hunt in by the end of this year. But if you read the posts on this board, almost no-one mentiions new content, but almost everyone is on the nerf druid bandwagon. If you did a 100% across the board poll asking if people would prefer a nerf to druids over new content, well I would bet all I have that new content would win out. Nobody here seems to realize that that is the coices they are making everytime they DEMAND Verant fix this or that, something else has to suffer, they have a limited set of resources to work with.<P>(Disclaimer: I only choose quad-kiting because it is a major flame issue here and it has been noted as a problem they are "looking at", this post is not about druids or kiting, it was an example only so do not post back about quad-kiting)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hummm ? board is full of frustrated customers and you think the solution is to remove the board?<P>Seems most of the post to this reply have been that if no one responded to frustrated customers that they would just not be any frustrated customers?  I think that if you ignore the frustrated customer enough they will in fact GO AWAY.<P>So all the frustrated and unhappy customers are vocal.. hummm seems right doesn't it? Maybe fixing the problems with the game would alleviate the problem to the boards?<P>Make every item no drop.<BR>This would fix campers and twinks<BR>and money hoarders. Everything magic should be lore and if it is lore should be tied to a quest or making of something useful. I will admit that 90 percent of the stuff out there is for making poisons and potions. <P>The lack of quests is what is sorely lacking in the game. <P>Quests should only be able to do it once.<BR>Quests should give alot better items than what they currently give.<P>Look at players that are happy with their characters (twinks) and make better items availible for those levels which they are happy.<P>By this I mean if a lvl 30 warrior is happy with his lvl 50 weapons and all the lvl 30 warriors without those weapons are unhappy then make all items no drop and minimum/maximum level for dungeon entry where the stuff is. let the level 30 characters get decent stuff dont make it so that a lvl 30 warrior cannot get a group or feel bad because he is not twinked. Or make his success more tied to the skill and character than to the items.<P>please do not remove the boards , wish there was an autofilter for you guys. but I cannot believe that you think there is nothing wrong with the game because you are not seeing it personally.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>First off, what I'm postin here is only my opinion...  I expect no one, including verant, to change anything because of it.  Just stating things how I see it.<P>First off - I played EQ for a while, then quit, and recently come back.  When I came back alot of changes had been made that -I- had asked for on these boards.  I do not know WHY verant made these changes, but if they had even stated that they were thinking about it I would never had quit.  They NEED some form of communication about their ideas and plans for the game.  <P>In essance they NEED dialogue.  The thousands of players have a much greater chance of discovering problems than their staff.  Thats not saying anything bad about their staff, its just math.  Not only that but 2-way communication will let players know whats coming.  When players know what Verant has planned they can come up with ideas that might help ADD to Verant's Vision.  <P>The only DOWNSIDE to this is that you can't make everyone happy, some players will be upset no matter what, and other players will be upset at other players ideas.  Its up to Verant to control this type of situation.  Their are countless ways to do this...  I will detail one below.<P>Seperate everything.  Seperate boards/teams for each topic.  Examples include giving EVERY class its own area, give tradeskills an area, create folders for group, solo, bugs, quests, everything - lol - and a conflicts folder for flames to be moved to.  Make strict board rules and follow them (such as limiting negative posts). <P>Each area needs to be monitored by people who CAN FIX problems that are presented or explain in detail why something won't be changed.  I'm not talking about a regualr board monitor, those can weed out the crap posts, but each folder would need a representative from the game monitor it as well. The person needs to be responsible for making sure the right people are notified.  For example, if a Cleric posts that a quest is broke, and 30 other clerics respond stating that they can't get it to work either - then the monitor of the cleric folder would need to notify the person in charge of testing/fixing that quest.<P>Some of that might seem excessive, and from a company standpoint it might seem as a waste.  But if each class has folder to discuss their own topics they can make problems public quickly.  This goes both ways for some problems as Exploits can be disclosed as well, but then it falls into the designers lap to fix these problems quickly.<P>Anyway, I'm rambling...  alot of this comes from my experience with other online games.  And for a game of this scale it would require enormous amounts of effort/time/people to be implemented. So I don't think anyone would blame Verant for NOT setting up such a system, but as it is now - I don't understand how they can have less than 10 real folders (not counting server-specific ones) and expect to be able to get reasonable feedback from this many people.<P>Their are other alternatives of course, but somethign needs to be done one way or the other. Because otherwise you might as well crap the folders and set up a suggestion box.<P>Just IMHO</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well I do have to admit that Verant does try to communicate with their customers, this board may be a mess at times, but people get passionate about their obsessions.<P>Though people mention they shouldn't even do boards like this, etc... I think that being its a ongoing game, aka they make money from its subscription base each month, they need to have a dialogue like this.<P>Its a game, that we can all admit, has some problems, be it zones released without anything in them working right, aka drops, etc..., character class problems, updates that cause major problems (ala the CH problem), etc... Without any communication on their parts those players that have their fun compromised by these changes will leave, thinking there is no one that will listen to them.  And for an example of this I harken back to the older days of UO's HORRID customer service base, you and 20 people you know could send an email (only way to communicate at that time) and no response on a problem.<P>Verant does put up with a lot of crap here on the board, and people do scream and whine (I admit I did that a bit earlier today, and I am sorry for it as normally I don't whine), but its a way for customers that might be questioning staying with a game to speak their mind and maybe, if lucky, have others agree, or discuss it, which might bring the attention of Auric or others.<P>So while I am sure its a money drain, time drain, etc... its, at least I think, very important to keep lines like this open.  Its not a buy once and over with game, its ongoing, and to keep customers I think a dialogue is important.<P>Just my thoughts,<BR>Pog <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Admittedly, i have fun reading and posting on this board. I do believe you seriously underestimate the direct and indirect revenue generated by this board. Maybe i purchased Tanurus because i noticed it here when i came to this board to post. No, if this board is shut down it will not be for economic reasons. It will shut down because of the "perceived harm" that the negative posts do. Only problem is shutting down this board won't stop people from posting negative things about EQ. In fact, negative comment will likely increase, just on a different board that Verant has zero control over. In the end, this board will be shut down one day. I don't really care if it is shut down sooner or later. I can always goto another board for amusement purposes. I just find it mildly amusing that Verant would hide behind the it needs to be cut for lack of resources exscuse. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Rognarrak,<P>You give an excellent example of the problem.<P>You post several things that you *know* if they did them, "people would be happy."  And yet, there are plenty of people who would *not* think these were good solutions, and in fact would find the game much, much less fun if they were implemented.<P>For example, only being able to do a quest once.  Hm, what does that mean?<P>- Bards can't have full lambent, because they can only do the bracer quest one time.<P>- Only enchanters can carry a Stein of Moggok, because other classes can't do the quest, and the 'chanters would probably keep the one they could do for themselves.  It also seems that your new rules would make this item no drop.<P>- "Everything magic should be lore and if it is lore should be tied to a quest or making of something useful."  So every magic weapon should be part of a quest for another weapon?  I think maybe you misstated yourself here, but even so, you're asking that no one be able to dual wield the same weapon, and that Verant rewrite every quest that currently requires more than one of the same magic item.<P>- Making every item no-drop would create huge problems with looting rights, and would destroy all player economy... something that Verant has deliberately introduced and fostered.<P>See, if they did what you suggest, maybe you and others would be happy, and maybe you wouldn't.  But I know that sure as heck *I* would not be happy, and I wouldn't be alone.  So your solution is not mine.<P>And that is what many posters fail to understand, and it causes much grief... they are frustrated, unhappy customers because Verant won't do what they think Verant should do, because Verant knows perfectly well that it would pretty much ruin the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>In reply to two things:<BR>A) I have played since Sept 99, I just only recently started reading the whine-play boards though. (and my enjoyment of the game has decreased with that experience)<P>B) Even if some tradeskill was messed up, maybe they said what they did just to buy enough time to finish up what they were working on. Unless you work for Verant you have no clue of their motives or what they have going on. I personally find it hard to believe that they do not know if something is broken, they just choose to not address or acknowledge it at a particular time.<P>They read the bug/feedback reports, monitor other websites and get feedback in-game. That is akin to getting hit on the head with a sledgehammer, kinda hard to not notice when so many people are telling you (ie: these boards are just one of many, many input devices).

</FONT><HR>I think a flaw in the logic of the original poster is, when you buy a boxed game set that is fixed and don't expect it to change and have little interaction with other players, then that sort of situation calls for very little customer support, everything about the game comes from what is included in the original box.<P>Verant has sold a product that is designed to be changable, and they advertise that they will change the game and its something you should expect as a player.  The moment that avenue is opened up then they have to consider how the changes effect their current player base.  Its impossible for them to anticipate all the reprocussions of every change, like that by altering the agro on heal code that a cleric can "effectively via taunt from healing" do more damage to a group of mobs than the best wizards area of effect spell.  If they just blindly changed something like that with no feedback from the consumer, then all of a sudden they would lose their cleric base, then they'd lose the rest of the players who rely on clerics to play the game.<P>Basically to have an actively changing continuously supported game, it is necessary to accept player input.  The boards don't generate dissatisfied customers, they help to give those customers an avenue to vent frustrations rather than just quitting.  It gives the customer the hope that a policy or code change that has been overlooked can be changed rather than player going oh i can't play with this i will just quit.  Now in order to justify from a revenue standpoint the expense of operating the board and paying moderators, verant would realistically have to prevent about 10 people per day from hitting the cancel button, but there are many more considerations in the book keeping standpoint that may justify it, as well as the notion that is a necessary "evil".<P>In game reps are there to provide support for problems with the game as they occur (though being told that a gm won't be on for 5 days is somewhat less than satisfactory), the phone line support is a back up to the in game solutions provided by the gm's.  The boards are a different creature, I don't come to the board because i need that batskull earring that somehow dissapeared off my necromancer to be replaced.  I come here because there is some outstanding issue that needs to be addressed, like the trade bug where items on my pointer icon dissapear when i am moving it to the trade window and the person hits cancel.  Or that taunt just simply isn't working effectively enough to allow me as a warrior to do the job of tanking.  There are issues that in game gm's and phone line customer support have no or little influence over and that is what the boards are for.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>When you are in the service industry things that alot of your customers like are providing a good ROI.  And besides if you take as given that fixing the bugs and stuff that this board has fixed is a good thing you have to show that they would have been caught without this board, and Im not sure you can.  This board is 3 or so employees alowing potentially 300k people to feedback, your in game test groups would have whoever they encoutered during the game, how many people do you encounter during the game?  A few hundred?<P>Also you make the case that verant could get this feedback from reading 3rd party boards.I dont nessecarily think that these posts would just migrate if these boards went away, people precieve this a place where official people listen, I dont often see the same type of content on regular eq boards, and I dont think its a given that I would without these boards.  Also, to get the 3rd party content they would have to pay someone to read it anyways, and it would be on 20x the boards (with 20 x the chaff), and youve already said that the main cost of the boards is the people who read them, so I dont see how they are gonna get the content from 3rd party boards without spending as much as they do to maintain their own, or more.<P>Basicly do you think that the type of feedback generated by message boards is positive for the game, if you do then this is the best way to do it, 3rd party boards are harder to monitor/moderate and cost just as much to read.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I feel that this message forum provides a service to the public as well as a value to those who provide it.<P>I will not bother to discuss all of the Ad money for banners ant the likes, however it should be mentioned as it is a positive value.<P>Service to the Public:<BR>1.) This board provides a channel by which I (or others) the customer can express our opinion of the product (EverQuest) and any changes made to it.<P>2.) It is also a channel through which customers can request changes, or improvements which will in the long run make more people happy.<P>3.) It is a place that people can come and rant about something that made them unhappy. This will either show them that there are others like them, or make them realize that they are being unreasonable. Whichever the outcome, the ranters are allowed an avenue to blow off steam.<P>4.) It provides humor, allows us to share our sorrows, and make announcements, all in the context of the EverQuest game world.<P>Value to You, the game creators:<BR>1.) It lets you see immediatly what the general popular view / opinion of a change. This opinion may not be based on fact, may even be totally off base or incorrect... however it is the way the customer 'sees' the change.<P>2.) It allows you to ask us, the customers, our opinions on things that may need to be changed. This includes new "wish" sort of things, as well as bug reports and nominal interface improvements that are not at all game world related.<P>3.) It lets you see just how off base we can be. The humor factor here has to at the very least keep you chuckling. I'm sure that whole PoM thread has the guy who scripted that area rolling on the floor day in and day out...<P>4.) And most importantly, it keeps YOU the game designers in touch with the game and its players. You could get some of this sort of feedback by 'snooping' players, watching their /tells, looking over their combats while 'god invis' etc. But it would require as much or more work for something you get here effectively by just reading.<P>The only problems I see with this board are:<BR>1.) The order by newest post system sucks. I'm sorry but this method makes the most vocal of posters the first page, and encourages bumping and multi-thread exploits to get something seen. The fix for this is simple... make the default sort for these pages be - 1 Created by blue name and then 2 Greatest number of replys in last 24 hours. Give the option of sorting on most recent post I guess, but its a poor model.<P>2.) You really need an off-topic/joke category. The list moderator should immediately move any posts that fit this category to it, and keep the real issues uncluttered.<P>3.) Threadjacking and off topic thread posts should be discouraged, even punished.<P>4.) And most importantly, any thread that gets enough posts to stay on the front page when sorted by number of posts should receive review, and comments by someone in charge. I don't care of those comments are just "I'm sorry, we can't / won't change this or that." Seeing the feedback will remove a great deal of the flames/anger that are here on this board. People make a fuss to get noticed, if they don't think they are being noticed they make a bigger fuss. Its a never ending spiral.<P>I hope this is not too long. (ok it is...) I also hope you can see my point of view at least, and consider it. The boards here are good, they can use work but they are overall... good.<P>Taliskar<BR>Bard on Test<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Without reading the other posts, just the original, I have to agree with the original poster. I guess he said it better than I, because, I posted almost the exact same thing before.<P>Verant, make changes as you see fit, but at the same time work closely with the game you have created, in every aspect. Please do not listen to the audience on this board. Make the changes based on your testing. Im sure that you are not out to hurt any class but only to make them better. Im sure that you are not out to make any class more powerful than another. I am also sure that you are not out to ruin this game, or push away players, but only to make it more enjoyable for new players and veteran players alike.<P>Test the game. We will let you know if you missed something, a bug perhaps, but the gameplay its self shouldnt be up to me. I am a player. In life I am a person, I cannot control the things around me and If I could, or other people could it would be utter Kaos. The majority of the people, more than 99%, including myself, want whats best for themselves.<P>Make the game challenging. We, your players, want the game to require a certain skill so that the better players will stand out above the others. Don't make us, the players, even in the gaming world make us UNEVEN, because our differences will be our qualities. Do not balance each class but instead make them equal. Or don't listen to my words, but lay down some law, and stick with it. Don't change it, and don't contradict these rules. <P>This board is out of control. How do I know? Because this post will not be read, not by somone in blue, and not by any person here. Its too far down the list! Just like me everyone is TOO SELFISH to listen to the other players, or verant, more importantly they want to get in their 2 cents as soon as they can.

</FONT><HR><BR>   People often make the point that EQ is not a role-playing game.  That's largely true, insofar as people do not actually adopt the role you might expect given the typical fantasy background.<P>   However, EQ does have one important aspect of an RPG.  It has the close association of the player with their character.  Most people don't think of their character as just some sprite off on a video screen.  They think of it as themselves.  That's why they get so attached to them, and get so emotionally involved with issues about their character.  They don't see them as issues about "their character", but as about themselves.  Thus, they lose their objectivity.<P>   This point adds a bit of complexity to the player-publisher/GM relationship.  There does exist that potential for actual emotional abuse.  People learned a long time ago in RPGs that the gamemaster really can't have the attitude that they are God, it's their game, and thus they can do whatever they want, while still retaining a satisifactory game.  Publishers of any sort of game where players identify that strongly with their game tokens will have to learn the same thing.<P>  It's true that it's Verant's game, Verant's bits, "we're in their world now", and they can do as they like.  But it may not be wise to take all the license that implies.  Nor does that necessarily extract the full potential available in the game system (and thus, ultimately, customer satisfication, dollars, and repeat business).<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>In my opinion these boards are invaluable.<P>I think "A" core problem is the nature of the BBS. There are much better board systems that can be implemented, and even this one probably has many options that are not used.<P>For example..<BR> Thread sorting..<BR> Thread expansion..<BR> EDITING of your own posts..<BR> RANKING and filtering of posts by readers..<BR> Ranking of POSTER.. ie trolls get voted down, good posters get better crediblity..<P>Slashdot is a great example of a board for great posts with intelligent discussion..<P>I think limiting the daily amount of posts you can make is a great idea... reminds me of my bbs days.. upload time for download time..<P>MASSIVE pruning of threads... not LOCKING them, but DELETEING the unneeded ones...<P>Ask us questions, expect our answers, and then comment on the feedback, then LOCK it when appropriate...<P>Communication is a 2 way street... otherwise you have people talking AT each other and not TO each other...<P>Warnings and bannings here should not be the same for the game...  People who can not communicate well here should not automatically be suspended from the game...<P>Thats all I have for now.. thanks for asking our for our input... now do something with it...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wasnt it Origin who shut down their message boards after Ultima 9 was released?  The players were very vocal about their feelings about the game so Origin thought it a good idea to just close the boards huge mistake.  The players and press had a field day with it and I know PC Gamers did a little article on it a while ago and did not paint Origin in a very favorable light so imagine what theyd do to Verant/SoE if they decided to do the same?   :lol:<P>And Im really failing to see the justification of it saving them resources they could use in other areas.  If I understand correctly responding to threads on this board is not Absors only job (which it should be) and as for the moderator, (correct me if Im wrong) I also understand they moderate several other boards as well (outside of EQ boards).  So how much money exactly would be saved here that they could use to pump into other resources?   And even if the moderator does only moderate EQ boards then how much would really be saved in removing these boards and their position?  My guess would be not a whole hell of a lot and not a lot to make that much of a difference in areas of testing as you mentioned so what is the real reason for wanting to shut down these boards?<P>And many of the changes added to the game aren't been tested anyway so what would be the point of removing money from an area that is used and adding it to an area that sees little use?   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Seriously though, if Verant could convince/show me that the money saved from shutting down these boards would go towards greatly enhancing their testing department then Id be the first one to say shut the damn things down.  But after this last fiasco (just one more on the list) then theyd be hard pressed to do that.<P>Are my views toward Verant jaded (as in fed up and bored with their continual arrogant attitudes)?  They most assuredly are, but I damn sure didnt get there all by my little lonesome.  I started out my first year playing this game as one of Verants #1 VAKs.  They could do nothing wrong in my eyes.  The game was wonderful and the best thing since ice cream.  Abashi and Brads word was gospel and those that challenged it were:<P>Trolls<BR>not seeing clearly<BR>someone who should simply quit<BR>Just mad cause they couldnt get their way<BR>Whining<BR>A Verant basher<BR>Bandwagon jumper<BR>Lemming<BR>Etc<BR>Etc<BR>Etc<P>But as I watched these boards and honestly read posts I moved more to the middle ground.  I wasnt a true VAK but I wasnt a Verant basher either.  I admitted they could make mistakes and often did, but refrained from outright treason so to speak.  J<P>But the more I watched and read, the more I began to see what some of the more intelligent posters who used to post here were talking about when they used to tell me one day Id see it to.  I saw the inconsistencies.  I saw their blatant ignoring of posters with well thought out and intelligent thoughts/ideas/questions.  I saw how Abashis dealings with the posters here just plan and simply sucked.  He showed favoritism to some and outright rudeness to others.  I saw how he reacted with snide remarks when players came to this board and presented facts and intelligent arguments on issues that at least proved something should be looked at but wasnt for months simply because he or Verant didnt agree or wouldnt agree (rangers, alchemy, poison, epics, spell drops, etc) with what the posters were saying.  But each time something like this happened Verant came back and acted like they could do no wrong again and again  But yet they did do wrong again and again which only helped to reinforce my current attitude.<P>And yes there have been many many good things done to EQ in the way of changes, improvements, and fixes to the game.<P>And all of what I just talked about happened and was a result of actions that took place primarily on THIS board.  <P>When players want to make a point or raise a concern they want Verant to hear do they go to other 3rd party boards?  Not hardly.  They come HERE.  When FoH wants to make a point or raise awareness to an issue do they simply leave it on their board for someone to cruise by and see?  No they come HERE.  Why?<P>Because this is one of THE best avenues for communicating with Verant whether or not Verant wants to reciprocate is another story and whether or not the like what they read is another story still.  Not every comment is going to include 'EQ is great' and they shouldn't.  Verant's a big company now so they should be able to take the bad with the good, but it appears that they can't or don't want to.<P>Who would really benefit if these boards were closed?  <P>Who would really win and who would lose?<P>Why is this even an issue important enough for the great Aradune to be the first one to post to it when I saw no posts from him on the cleric fiasco at all?<P>What really would be saved if these boards were closed?  Money?  Or someones pride?  <P>If Verant would step up and take many of the great suggestions made in this thread to heart and honestly give them a try them maybe that can start moving forward towards this improved CS Smedley said was coming a few months back (what ever happened to that anyway?)<P>- I think the CS people that are assigned to the boards should no longer 'filter' information that they take to the tuning meetings.  Present player concerns as they're posted and let the process of the meeting filter things out.  If they dont understand the issue then post a question and ask.  I have much more confidence in a decision that's made from using a 'team' approach as opposed to a one man approach.  <P>And besides if they can't separate the BS from intelligent musings/ideas then we really have a problem here and it's not these boards.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>- I like the idea of limiting the number of posts per day.<P>- I like the idea of adding a forum where blue name posts can be moved to so players know what issues have been addressed and how.<P>- I like the idea of dividing classes and maybe even levels out into separate forums so players and Verant can focus more closely on specific issues.<P>- I like the idea of adding more dedicated CS and dev reps so they can talk to players and respond more much more.<P>- I like the idea of having a board that maintains patch info past and present.<P>- If they don't create more focus forums then they definitely need to get rid of the OT threads and posts.  They serve no useful purpose towards EQ and only serve to irritate players trying to get some type of issue resolved.  They create conflict and division nothing more.<P>- I like information and as a paying customer I deserve as much GOOD information as Verant can feed me.<P>THAT is how they can improve their CS not be taking away but by ADDING. <P>As far as I'm concerned Verant is getting exactly what they're asking for on these boards (and that goes from positive feedback to negative and also to ideas).  If they don't want to hear it then fine shut the boards down, but personally I'd see that as a grave mistake on their part.  <P>But come to think of it would that really be such a big surprise?<P>Just my opinion<P>Morgian Cessair<BR>Druidesss of Povar.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree with both sides of this issue.<P>These boards have negatively influenced my opinion of Everquest, but they also serve a purpose.<P>My main characters are a Wizard and a Ranger.<BR>Before I began reading these boards I was blissfully ignorant of any issues regarding these two classes. And I was happy with the game as a whole.<P>This does not mean that these issues did not exist just that I was unaware of them. The more experienced players who post here made me aware of deficiencies and imbalances in the game that I did not see before. I still love my Wizard and my Ranger, but I am not happy with the game as a whole.<P>These boards are a valuable source for VI to get player feedback. VI should not lose this customer input.<P>Here is my suggestion:<P>Have all posts submitted for review. Only post publicly the ones that someone from VI will respond to. This will filter out all the garbage posts from people who are trolling, prevent excessive negative comments about the same issues, eliminate the ever present Class A is better than Class B threads, et al. But at the same time still give VI the feedback from the players. Also when the people who have nothing to say stop seeing their posts published, the volume of posts will decline, making it easier to manage.<P>I believe that VI does care about the people who play EQ, and they honestly do try to address the things brought up here.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Take a look at the moderation scheme of slashdot.org sometime. On those boards, a large number of selected users meta-moderate the boards. Most of the flame bait/useless posts get moderated down to the point very few people see them.  If you wish to subject yourself to that drivel, however, you can change your settings to display all posts.<P>Eliminating the boards isn't the answer. People will move the discussions elsewhere, and get angry when Verant doesn't read or respond to posts. Wasn't that the original reason these boards were created? Scanning EQVault, EQStratics, castersrealm, eqdruids, etc was too time consuming and repetitive for Verant. (and it showed favoritism for certain sites) User's demand for feedback from the developers won't just go away you know, they'll just expect it to be posted to more places. (and get angry if it isn't)<P>Harsh moderation by Verant also isn't the answer.  People will accuse Verant of censorship. (probably correctly occasionally, its impossible to be a completely perfect, objective moderator all the time)  In the end, it would just add fuel to the fires and make Verant look like blackbooted thugs.<P>User meta-moderation has worked for other sites, to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and clears Verant from looking like hardasses. Float the highly rated posts to the top, and make the idiots not displayed by default. (however their posts are still there if they were moderated unfairly)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
