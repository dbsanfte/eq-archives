</FONT><HR>Rotarr:<P>Your point is exactly our point.  Why should anyone seriously consider the tradeskills when what you really need to do is Hack/Slash/Kill/Loot/Repeat.  After all, this is the only way to advance your character.<P>All we're asking is if the Tradeskills are there, why aren't they viable instead of so much wasted code.  Certain aspects of the trades are helpful as someone pointed out earlier (Making Arrows, Some pottery, and Jewelcraft) but the vast majority of goods are not necessary in the least to the game.<P>This thing is billed as an RPG, but the only method of advancement is to kill (Ala Quake).  And to get plat you have to hunt and level, so you can kill better monsters that drop better (supposedly) loot.  Then and only then can you afford to pump a whole bunch of plat into a tradeskill (except for Pottery which only needs about 10 to 15 plat to become master for some strange reason).<P>As I've said, it's unfortunate the game wasn't designed around the trades instead of the other way around.<P>Oh well.<P>Rocco Scarpaci<BR>Cazic Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have to agree with the original post's theme.<P>Verant broke the Tradeskill machine in EQ.<P>It's sad, but true.  90% of "craftables", as I understand it, are useless and not worth the cost, time, and frustration involved.  I'm not a tradsperson, I haven't picked up any trade past 70 skill...  But I am very interested in player's options as far as craftables go.  I'm rabid about fashion, and was ecstatic when I heard of the Fine Plate additions, cultural armor, and other such goodies.  And when I found out that there were ROBE patterns, I was even more excited.  My disappointment came when I found out that these were either broken, insane in cost, and generally wouldn't be available to me unless I picked up a tradeskill and bled for it.  <P>I truly feel for the zealous tradespeople out there, and wish that their "life" could be made easier... and their fanciful creations made more useful.  The potential is there, but sadly it tapered off real quick after Banded in my opinion.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

It shows. Who ever designs it for EQ2 I strongly suggest they have a economics back ground.

</FONT><HR>Please look at trade skills VI..I really wanted to learn them, but they are a waste of time and WORSE--a waste of precious plat better spent on BETTER items that can be bought for LESS money.  Make trade skills cheaper, and I will sink MONTHS into doing them.  Make them worth SOMETHING (at least to break EVEN) and I will sink MONTHS into doing them.  MONTHS = more money for you.  Multiply that times thousands of players who will do them and you get MORE RL MONEY!  I am tired of the game already--tradeskills will bring back some magic for me (so what). BUT, figure for every one of me, there are a lot more wishing the same thing.  More = RL $$...think about it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The biggest problem Verant has is the lack of communications with the player base in regards to tradeskills.  Go to the tradeskill forum here and see the last time Yakatzima posted a reply.  It was 2 weeks ago and there was no follow on.<P>Verant should have Yak posting daily.  Even if its to say, 'Yes, we are busy working on these issues'.  Right now, we don't even know they read the boards... Sure, they say 'We are always reading the boards', but there is just no evidence of it.<P>For instance, myself and many other gnomes are a bit miffed about the watchman armor (class/race limitations, faction hits from killing mobs that drop components, and insanely high level needed to make the items).  Yak responded that he acknowledges there are holes in the trivial chart to get people up in skill level to something that can make armor at a reasonable cost.  That's it.  Nothing more about tinkering.  Nothing saying, when changes will come, or if they will be worthwhile.<P>I applaud Verant for adding the watchman armor to tinkering skill, but this is not the overhaul that is needed.  Armor for gnome clerics/warriors just doesn't cut the mustard.  Verant is confused and does not have a clear vision of tinkering.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It can be argued that EQ failed in trade skills but it's good to know that at least they got most of the low level armour right.<P>If I loved trade skills more than battles, I would still be playing UO.  However, UO2 looks better than EQ and it incorporates trade skills well too.  So I'm still waiting for the next generation of MMORPG's.

</FONT><HR>I use to do trades also, but I too found them to be a waste of time.<P>First char was a druid smith. Took 6 months to get to level 16 because of the time I spent making money selling banded. Had about 800 p in the bank and some good items.<P>Latest char took 1 month to get to level 24, and has just as much in the bank, and equal gear.<P>Heck, I even went back to my old server, and my old druid when fine steel came out. Bigger waste. Even as a druid who can port everywhere, it takes forever, and cost a fortune to make armor that just can't be sold at a high enough profit to make it worth while (there is better stuff out there for the same or less money). And forget trying to get it dyed LOL. <P>Not sure about the other skills, but smithing is a failure. Funny thing is that it could be great if they would just lower the cost of materials, increase the learning curve, and make materials more available, and make dying it easier. In short, make it worth while. <P>Fine steel should be the banded of the 20s. Good armor that is affordable for everyone.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>/agree (hey wow  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">..)<P>I don't boggle or anything though.  It's just a rather obvious fact that tradeskills were never meant to be a major aspect of EQ, comparably to UO.  (I'd say for example, but it's the only example, so I'd be cheating  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">..)<P>Tradeskills are based around the central philosophy of the game - kill creatures/go places to get x ingredient for x item.  I can see why they've done this, it's a solid design philosophy to reference everything back to your central philosophy (Aka. Vision), however I think in doing so they've lost a lot of player interest in doing tradeskills.<P>Not saying that Yak does a bad job at all, I think he'd be pretty snowed under trying to do all this stuff, which is probably why there are recipes that don't work after having been in-game for a long time.<P>But I am saying I'd think harder next time if I was you guys.  Tradeskills, particularly not linked to player power (level), are a big drawcard for a sizeable group of people.  They are also a good distraction from the normal flow of play.  There's nothing wrong with hack'n'slash type games, they're entertaining and can be fun.  I wouldn't agree that EQ is just that (It's really in the hands of the player), but it is beneficial to provide the players with the means of distraction from regular gameplay.  Increases game longevity = good for customer and company.<BR>Currently the tradeskills seem to point the player back to the regular facets of gameplay.  (See how powerful the vision that so many people discount as fluff can be?)<P>Now does this mean the vision is flawed?  Hardly.  The whole game would suck if that was the case.  No rather they didn't focus heavily on this area during design phases.  Someone already mentioned building the game around tradeskills - that would be a pretty bold move.  I don't think it would hurt at all though to have a fairly well thought out tradeskills system which was self sufficient in terms of design philosophy, and removed from regular aspects of gameplay.  (I.e.  Rather than killing something to get something, make another tradeskill create that something.  Ultimately everything is made from the same ingredients.)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Now my DE smith has no way to make any magical armor.  Dwarves and others can imbue without enchanting first, but not DEs.

</FONT><HR>Amethyr:<P>I was the one who suggested that a game be built around tradeskills.  And you are correct, doing that would be a bold move. What I meant by that probably did not come across in what I wrote.<P>What I really meant with that was similar to what you said about the Trades apparently not having a heavy focus during initial design.  If you are going to have viable trades, then the products of those trades must be integrated into the game at intial design and in every step thereafter.  <P>Thought must be given to each product as to its usefullness within the game structure during design.  And, on the same token, care must be taken with the game structure itself, so that it fully encompasses the tradeskill in question.<P>If you design the structure with no trades in mind, then tack them on after the fact, you (and I mean "you" in the general sense) end up with a disconnected aspect of the game.  Some parts may fit, others will be superfluous.  And if you code in items that don't fit or aren't usefull, then you have wasted your programmer's valuable time, because those items will not see much, if any, play time.  <P>And then there's the issue of character advancement while pursuing the trades (leveling in EQ's case).  If trades are fully integrated correctly, this should not be as big of an issue as it is currently.  If you decide to dabble as a tradesman, you're skills as an adventurer will slow proportionately to your dabbling.  If you decide to Master the trades, your skills as an adventurer will suffer greatly, but you would be the equal of a Master Adventurer in terms of chosen profession.<P>I'm also not suggesting that this sort of integration could be accomplished in EQ at this time.  It would probably require so much revamping that it would end up being EQ2 anyway.  There may be many things that could be done to come close, but I doubt they will be.  It will probably take EQ2 or another game designed with Trades in mind from the very start.<P>Anyway, thanks for the comments, Amethyr, and everyone else for that matter.  Good Discussion.<P>Rocco Scarpaci<BR>Cazic Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Some quotes gleaned from above:<P>&gt;&gt;and why is fletching so hard?...&lt;&lt; <P>&gt;&gt;Fletching- will not make you money but will save you money in the long run(if you use a bow)&lt;&lt;<P>&gt;&gt;Tailoring- Only tradeskill you have a chance of making a decent profit at(due to 10 slot backpacks-and nothing else)&lt;&lt;<P>&gt;&gt;what's worse about tradeskills is, besides jewelcraft, most of them aren't desired. items dropped in the game are way better than anything a master smith could ever hope to make. same with tailoring and fletching.&lt;&lt;<P>O.K, I agree that trade skills aren't as inviting as they ought to be but...<P>Lol, fletching hard? Lol, will not make you money?<P>I have 10 characters spread across two servers and all but one fletch (the other one hasn't had time to get her kit yet). Fletching is one of the simplest trade skills (pottery and tailoring being the others (that I have tried)). Most of my characters have financed themselves, through their teens, from fletching and tailoring. It hasn't given them a luxurious lifestyle but it has certainly given them a good income (btw I never pass things between my characters so they literally do have to work hard to earn their keep). They have no trouble selling the arrows and my Iksar SK has even taken a sabbatical from bashing in order to just sell arrows to the tourists in LoIO because it is so profitable, at least 100 per cent markup and she still sells for less than other fletchers(o.k., sure, it would be nice if she could earn money and level as well).<P>Depends what you mean by a decent profit. My characters have little problem selling a silk swatch for 1pp which is a hefty profit, considering that the only cost is the sewing kit. Also, silk thread realizes a substantial profit now and raw silk clothing is also an excellent perennial favorite sell.<P>Sure, I am not talking about anything other than basic skills and it isn't uber income but it is fun, you get to interact with other players a lot and, for non-twinkers at least, it is a great way to earn some money, especially if, like me, you get tired of just bashing mobs all the time.<P> <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>/agree Carolan, to a point.<P>Your right, fletching and tailoring are very handy skills to have. Every one of my starting characters has a sewing kit for making his first bits of armor.  And the ones that can use a bow have a fletching kit. <P>But I have a couple of questions (not a flame, I'm just curious) <P>Have you ever taken a trade skill to master, and beyond that have you approached the 200 skill level?<P>Have you ever sold any magic arrows, or any bows, or any of those arrows that have 25 range that you use to raise skill.  <P>Again, just curious.<P>I've only been able to move Class 2 wood point arrows with any regularity (the 150 range ones), and occasionally the Class 2 Bone arrows, but not often.  The Class Wood 150 range ones trivial at 56.  I've sold one bow, though I admit that I haven't made them until asked.  But I'm asked much, and when I am, even 100% markup is too high for those that do ask.  I've never sold any magic arrows, and never seen any in /auction, buying or selling.  They are darned spendy to make.<P>But you are right, when you are coming up, those two trades, fletching and tailoring are darned handy.  You can advance while you learn them and use what you make.  And in the case of tailoring, sell back to vendors for a profit (depending on failures) since patterns are only a few silver and the vendors buy the patchwork for a gold or more.  Or you can even sell the patchwork to other new PCs (though that only works on a new server with any regularity.)<P>This kind of tradeskill use actually works pretty good.  But it only takes you to the point where the time needed for furthering skill level causes you to slow character advancement and waste loads of cash on non-usable items just to raise that skill.  And during that "skill raising" time you're not making any money at all which is why we want to make a killing on the good stuff we can make when we approach 200.<P>I spent about 2000 plat getting my fletching to the mid 180s.  And that's not counting the money from selling back the arrows to vendors (they were the 25 range ones).  That was probably around another 1000 plat, maybe a tad less. (it only took about 300 or so plat to get to 101, if I recall).  But I wanted to be a Grand Master Fletcher,and cash be damned.  However, when I got there, I found all I could sell was class 2 wood point arrows that trivial at 56.<P>I was a ranger and was able to make my Trueshot, which, as a ranger made me very proud.  And I sold a few Trueshots, not many though, mainly because they are lore and you have to run all over hell's half acre for the parts.<P>Anyway, there I go rambling..heh...as I said, I could talk for pages....heh.<P>Thanks for the coments...<P>Rocco Scarpaci<BR>Cazic Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, if you want to read about my extreme frustrations with the incredibly slow and painful increase in skill in smithing, go to the tradeskill board and read it.<P>But let's correct some things being said.<P>1) Blacksmithing CAN be profitable.  I have made a large profit by working my tail off and being savvy.  And I have had a great time.  Until recently, when I decided to start trying to skill up to 200 (at least).  But read my other post about that.<P>2) The 'fiasco' about ornate chain had nothing to do with the recipe.  It WAS there, no one had found it yet. You can be really cynical and assume that it wasn't there, and Yak ended up having to put it in a really random place to make it seem he had hidden it there before, but I can honestly believe no one saw it before.  Now, as to the recipe working when they entered the game...or being worthwhile at all.  Well, that's different.<P>Most of the cultural armor is terrible.  Dwarven in no included in this terrible list, but let's be serious.  Do they think that having a bunch of smiths with 250 skill is gonna make the highest end cultural armor common?  <P>For those who don't know, without failures, a full set of Enchanted Imbued Dwarven Plate would take approx 84 (someone else figured that out, it should be close enough) JACINTHS!  I guarantee you, if I were suddenly at skill 250 I would not be making that set tomorrow.  After working about 4 months getting as many as I can (as a non-planar capable character) I have exactly 4.  Whee.<BR>I couldn't even make a helm.<P>Please stop punishing us for trying to NOT<BR>power level all the time.  Tradeskilling is social, it removes money from the system and occasionally is even cool.<P>Gryfalia<BR>35 Cleric of Brell, Druzzil Ro<BR>Silver Wolf Pack<BR>Master Smith 189<BR>Master lots of other things...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Celoria_Sylvatia: What I meant about GM Smith in UO being bad for fighting is that you have a total skill cap of 700, so you can be GM in only 7 skills. Now if two of those are Mining and Smithing, you can have less GM fighting skills. Just STR of 100 and one weapon skill at GM doesn't make a great UO fighter.<P>I think it is too late to re-build EQ around tradeskills. But please, just decrease the prices for molds or increase the money NPCs give you for items you created. The money you lose if you fail your skill check is bad enough. Losing money on a SUCCESS is unacceptable.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I was introduced to trade skills by a friend and I have to say I came into the game not even knowing trade skills where a part of it. Just to give you an idea of how what I wanted this game to do for me though, I didn’t start out fighting, I killed a few mobs, did the newbie thing (exploring your guild hall and so on), then went right to fishing. Now I develop all my trade skills, even knowing from the very beginning that I would make no profit from most of them, why? <P>The truth is I love developing my trade skills for the role-playing aspect of it. Nothing like baking a birthday cake for someone's (virtual) birthday and handing out pieces with some malted milk. Nothing like brewing for a group just so they can have drunken races and other type of fun activities (never touched the stuff (Paladin of Marr should not)). Pottery I needed for baking the cakes and muffins. Right now I have over 250 chunks of meat and about 100 chunks of gator meat (now only if gator rolls worked as they should). <P>No one wants these things off of crocs and I collect them and make food out of them. Tailoring? Most newbies are looking for something cheap and with most of the players being master smiths newbies can have a hard time finding someone that will even bother making PW or studded. I happen to like the fact that I can make and sell armor they can afford. And for some I do give it away, but I know that as a newbie I liked “earning” my armor so I’ll sell it for a cheap price (at cost most of the time).<P>Smithing ... well this one has been the money hole for me and I'm stuck somewhere in the 80's right now because I really do need to advance my levels. Hopefully the money I get from higher mobs will get me on the way to at least over 100. So for me trade skills where never and will never be about profit. To me it's about role-playing and being and developing my character into an individual. Besides, I find it fun at times to make lanterns, light armor, cooking supplies, and more just to sell them to those people who really need them (granted it’s rare). <P>But I am bumping the thread with this post because I do agree that some level of effectiveness has to be implemented into trade skills. And for those that do care about profit it's very true that if you are going to call something a TRADE skill there should be some profit in it being the time it takes to invest and build that skill. After all it basically becomes your TRADE. So yes, please fix the broken recipes and address the issues Verant.<P>On a last note I kind of like the fact that few people as a whole even bother with the lesser skills. It's kind of fun being asked to cater for an event or surprise your barbarian friend out in the field because you just looted enough components to make enough food to stay there 3 or 4 more days (a spit is a baker's best friend). Again this is just my opinion of trade skills now as not so much for profit but to separate myself from the masses and give my character some individuality. Did I mention the females find it "cute" that you can make them a white wine dinner with some fillets (or lion steak, the meat is a bit less tough than bear) and finish it of with some berry pie?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Tramaus<BR>19th Paladin - Order of Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>-=-=-=-=-<BR>It would have been better possibly for Verant to have started with Tradeskills and built the rest of the game around them. This way, they would be an inherent part of life on Norrath. Instead, they appear to be an afterthough, and the items created are largely superfluous to general gameplay.<BR>-=-=-=-=-<P>I was in Beta2+, and one of the things I really looked forward to was the tradeskills in EQ (I had given up on UO, pk-fest that it was.) However, upon arrival it turned out that the only general tradeskill in game was (drum roll please......) tailoring patchwork.<P>*BOGGLE*<P>Having been a miner/blacksmith/tinkerer in UO, I had looked forward to these skills (ever wonder why the bank in Kaladim sells Pickaxes? Mining was originally planned... And yes, that was from a GM.)<P>I played all the way through Beta, and while I never reached a very high level I explored most of the 2 continents that I frequented (Antonica for most of it, then Faydwer when they brought it online.)<P>Tradeskills have always been the red-headed-stepchild of EQ, and nothing has changed. Yes, they can finally (after how long?) make some decent equipment, probably stuff that should have been in in the first place. But no matter what happens, EQ will always be first and foremost a standard hack-slash-heal-repeat game. Tradeskills will probably be broken for the life of the game, they just don't consider them worth the time. (BTW: I'm a 168 brewer, 200 fletcher, 100-something blacksmith, so I'm familiar with broken crap.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I too did tradeskills in UO.  <P>I had:<P>1) Grandmaster Smith/Grandmaster Miner<BR>2) Grandmaster Alchemist/Grandmaster Poison (assassin.. gm fencing/resist/tactics/healing/anatomy too.. wasnt really just a tradesman. At her time this char kicked serious butt :P)<BR>3) Grandmaster Fisherman/Treasure Hunter (also a gm mage but not pvp oriented)<P>Course I also had my fighters  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>I ran a large business out of my Tower.<P>It was fun.. That is until OSI added the "Burst Hour". Now anyone can make a tradesman easily with money earned farming in trammel (with a 1 week old warrior).  That said, almost everyone now is self sufficient and has a mule/jack of all trades.  So sales arent that great.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
