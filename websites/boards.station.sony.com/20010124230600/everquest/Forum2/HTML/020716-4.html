</FONT><HR>Just to clarify. I do not dispute that Verant had the legal right to refuse service to anyone, for any reason or no reason at all.<P>I just think they have no moral ground to stand on. It seems a little hypocritcal to complain about someone else's taste in literature when you are marketing and profiting from a game that takes mayhem and various forms of bloodshed to a high art. <P>Many, many, many people find the type of game Verant markets to be morally offensive. Their choice. Personally, I enjoy murdering innocent bystanders for fun and profit. But not everyone agrees with this. Verant needs to grasp the concept that not everyone is going to agree with the preconceptions about how to play the game, how to regard the game world, or how to roleplay the game. <P>Did they have the right, legally, to ban anyone they want? Yes. Did they have the moral right to ban someone because they found a particular piece of fictional writing offensive? Dunno. But it certainly makes a good argument  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>(I am throwing this in here as a bump - it was posted again in a separate topic when I realized what I was doing),<P>Today, I deleted all my characters and quit my account in protest for the banning of Mystere, and<BR>accumulated other issues.<P>Just to let you know, I don't know this lady. I don't frequent that board. I didn't read the story until after this came up here - and did everyone notice the MANY warnings of sexually explicit content at the top? The year<BR>is 2000, not 1984. Verant, the Internet is NOT "your world".<P>But this is only another symptom of the main problem; the problem is that the Verant folks we have to deal with are neither nice nor honest.<P>I have no high level characters - but Verant seems to want to stop leveling by inserting random ultra-high-level NPCs where they will kill the most newbies and lowbies. I was looking forward to my first character with a Last Name (!). Now I'll give someone else my money, and my time.<P>Today was my first post on these boards, and my last day of posting.<P>Good, Quit, Less Lag for You - sure I've heard that. Have fun, if you can. Keep looking over your shoulder, for Thraken Griften in WK, Brownies in LF, and Loathsome Individuals in Qeynos Hills. Hope you don't aggro the sand<BR>giant in Oasis, he will summon you before you can zone. Imagine trying to confront these with a character in the high teens. What you get is<BR>repetitive, senseless, brutal death and a dangerous or impossible CR.<P>The changes to the game, added to their response (what response?) to many complaints, are enough. Too much added frustration, added on purpose, to<BR>try to keep us playing longer at lower levels. (Yes, we can see the reasons why they were added, and it has nothing to do with some vague storyline. The reason has everything to do with maximizing Verant/Sony's profit.)<P>But also keep looking over your shoulder in everything you do - if George Scotto does not like the way you write in a non-Sony forum, your account may be banned, six months after you post it.<P>Not to mention: <P>* Guilds with over 50 members were deleted and Abashi DID NOT EVEN APOLOGIZE. <P>* Abashi is only here to lessen Sony's email and respond to all necro complaints within four posts (look at it, count).<P>* Bards songs are all Broken as Intended (a friend of mine in Real Life (tm) is a high-level bard) and Abashi won't even answer the posts; many bard threads here were just locked and deleted.<P>So, it has become clear to me. Verant does not care. Abashi is a sock puppet, his main purpose is to make the player base THINK someting is being done, and if needed lie to the player base, all to try to keep the money rolling in longer. (Sure, all the Epic quests have been extensively tested...)<P>These are not nice people. I'm tired of giving them money, I'm tired of dealing with them, I'm tired of listening to their lies. <P>I may see you down the line in the next (non-Verant) MMORPG. Never again in EQ.<P>Shaught, ex-18th Barbarian Shaman<BR>Azzuza, ex-9th Eruidite Necromancer<BR>Skink, ex-16th Iskar Warrior<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>My lord, people still don't seem to get it. This has nothing to do with copyright or anything else. It has to do with child pornography. Not an isolated story, either, but a consistent behaviour for months.<P>Mystere posted a story which is consistent with everything I have seen in cases of rape and child abuse. The patter of submission, victimization, and abuse is completely textbook. I have a good friend who has spent his entire life making little money and getting even less thanks for putting perverts who abuse children - or write about abusing children, they usually go hand in hand - in jail. Thank God he's not the only one fighting the good fight in this world of Columbine and internet child porno.<P>He made every single effort to make it very clear that his victim was very young. He could have left it ambiguous. He could have made it clear they were adult. But no, he chose to make it very clear that the victim was very young.<P>I can't be bothered reading all of these, but wonderful parallel on choosing Piers Anthony. He was, according to fans, forced out of teaching for having sex with an underaged student. Great example, thank you! For an example of child abuse in a popular horror writer's work, try _Gerald's Game_ by Stephen King. The majority of the story shows the painful emotional fallout from having an abusive relationship in childhood, and does anything but glorify it. Which this story did.<P>His little EQ world has been wrecked. Good. I personally hope that social services comes knocking on his door and shows him exactly what REAL kind of penalties can be had for subjecting children to rape and torture, even in fantasy. He may have never looked at a child sideways in real life, but he is definitely shown tendencies which are undesirable in such a public, family environment. I hope whoever notified Verant about this activity also registered it with legal authorities. I hope every time a kid is abused in his town he has to stand in a lineup. Play with fire, you get burned. Nobody made him write or post the story. He has nobody but himself to blame for the repercussions.<P>Once again, THANK YOU VERANT. Thank you for having the intelligence and the moral fortitude to take a stance on something like this. Thank you for ensuring a safe, family atmosphere online as you promise on the box. Thank you, a hundred times over. You have my family's guaranteed continued patronage.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Frankly,I read the story,and found it to be more than properly horrifying.<BR> <BR>Unfortunately,it also used terms and references that more than clearly make it an "EverQuest story". <BR> <BR>As a mature adult,I can appreciate horror. Some cannot. More ignorant folk _will_ use it as an example of "what people really do in EQ".<BR>  <BR>The resultant PR would be rather nasty. Thus,I believe,the ban.<BR> <BR>I've played in a number of live-action RPG's. One of those characters I have played had (in-game,no real harm was done to ANYONE) their apprentice slain horribly for breeding with a human(she was half-elven and married to him and just found out she was going to be a mother),the same night slain in _his_ bed on his wedding night by another,dug out of his grave by same,reanimated in a horrifying and mind-shattering ritual,and spent the better part of a year tormenting his newly wedded wife into madness as the necromancer's undead,ghoulish slave who enjoyed sending back the mangled crawling bodies of anyone sent to "release" him as presents.<BR> <BR>That's in low detail,mind you. Some people can handle that level of roleplay as it fully was,MANY cannot. Thus the lack of graphic detail. This story did not and was most obviously an "EverQuest" story,fanfiction or no.<BR> <BR>It is the many that cannot that resulted in this ban-something I wish should not of happened,but had to eventually. EQ players are not all over 18. Some minds do not handle details of violence,sexuality,and the like as well as others. Others do not wish to. Some can. But not all. Verant is concerned about the "all". Such is life.<BR> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I've now read the story Mystere wrote.  It was a story of a calculated, ritualistic torture - the sort of thing that one would expect from a primitive, animist religion (lots of examples of this in Earth's history) or, say, nasty, evil Dark Elves.  Verant - don't create an environment which fuels imagination then complain when that imagination goes someplace you don't like.  I'm a writer myself - if I ever wrote fanfiction I could have written that story.  YOU HAVE NO JUST CAUSE FOR YOUR ACTIONS VERANT.  Not only that, you do not have the decency to answer the complaints presented here...it is your world, so everybody else can just sod off.  Great attitude...if you want to lose customers.<P>There is a great brick wall called Verant present here.  They don't have to answer you, they don't have to make things better, you'll keep playing anyway.  Sadly, for the moment, this is true.  But like a moth to a flame Verant spiral ever closer to self destruction.  Eventually people will get too tired of not hearing any meaningful response to complaints and this game will die, unless there is a massive change in attitude...such as reinstating Mystere and giving her 6 months free.<P>Mystere, if by any means you get to read this, I salute you and pray that you are reinstated, if you even wish to be after this crap.<P>Verant, what say you?  Do you have the balls to respond to this rather large thread, or will you cower behind your brick wall and slaughter the goose that lays the golden eggs?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Acadine, <P>Go back and read my reply to Amethyr.  Then please tell me again how EverQuest is a "safe, family atmosphere online" when you spend your entire time killing and looting in a setting where it's kill or be killed.  Please explain to me how a game setting that has mutilated bodies, torture chambers, and constant violent attacks is a "safe, family atmosphere online."  Apparently virutal participation in killing and looting in that atmosphere is okay.  Writing about it is not.<P>I imagine you'll tell me how every writer who ever depicts acts of graphic violence must of course be a perpetrator of such acts, and as such is morally bankrupt.  I love people who are ready to bring out the lynch mob because they can't be bothered to work out a little common sense.

</FONT><HR>This is *NOT* about child pornography.  Child pornography laws all deal with *images* of children used in sexual materials.  This is a piece of written fiction that will not (and legally cannot, Acadine) attract any interest from law enforcement or social services personnel.  <P>I don't particularly like the story. I suspect I found it as disturbing as many of you did. But what you don't seem to understand is that the written word enjoys the highest level of constitutional protection for very good reasons. <P>Being a "pervert" of ANY type is not a crime or even wrong. Certainly acting out many "perversions" involves immoral and criminal acts, but in no case is the creation of written fiction a criminal or immoral act. It may well be a violation of Verant's copyrights, but their selective protection of the copyright based on the content of the offending speech is unamerican. <P>The first amendment is there to protect repugnant speech, not just the speech we all agree with. In the internet world, where an increasing amount of our public speech occurs on corporate owned bulletin boards and not in town squares, we need to be aware that infringement of our rights is increasingly likely to come from corporate bodies and not the government. <P>The story was not forced on anybody. It did not appear in the game.  It did not appear on Verant's boards. The warnings about its content were pretty damned clear. If you change a few names, it doesn't even infringe Verant's copyrights.<P>Verant has the low ground in this moral witch hunt.  Those of you who support Verant share it with them.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I haven't read the story, so I can't really make any comment as to its appropriateness.<P>What I can say is that this is clearly one more step in the evolution of censorship which I discussed (with Bloodsage, I might add) in another thread on these boards.  Sorry, BS, but I think this continues to prove and reinforce my point.<P>Making her take down the story due to copyright violation is one thing.  Even suing her over it.  But to choose to revoke her user account clearly has NOTHING to do with the copyright issues, but is simply one more punitive and vindictive act by a company that is becoming increasingly more punitive and vindictive over time.<P>She wrote a story on a private board.  She is NOT a guide, as I understand it.  There is NOTHING in the EULA to ban her for this, except the "we can ban anyone at anytime" clause.  And I would fully expect evil races to do vile and evil things.  They may NOT be permitted to do them in the game, but in roleplaying wholly outside the game...<P>I'm just glad that I play less and less of EQ.  Disgust is purging me of my Evercrack addiction, and I expect that soon I will be able to feel the sweet relief of account cancellation.<P>Shame on you, Verant.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I'm not a lawyer and based on the responses I read, I don't think a copyright lawyer has responded.<P>That being said first, I don't think copyrights can be selectively enforced.  If VI (or Sony) is going to insist that she not use any information from their product, I believe the request has to be consistent.  Without that consistency, they lose their ability to enforce the copyright by setting a precedent of not enforcing it.<P>I'm trying to recall some of the information I learned in college many years ago about it, so I may be mis remembering.<P>On the other hand, they may have something in their EULA that says something to the effect of "we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone".  If so, then they can use that and viola! no defense.<P>As for all the other stuff about whether the story was sick or not, I don't know.  I didn't read it.  Didn't have an interest in it after some of the comments I've heard about it.  But that's my choice and I'll vigorously defend her right to write things that I consider horrific.  She is as entitled to her opinions as I am to mine.<P>Art is subjective.  Some people may love Picasso.  I'd just as soon pour turpentine over most of his stuff.  It doesn't inspire me, enthrall me, or enrich my life.  His paintings of women were painted the way they were because of his hatred of women.  Does that mean they should be destroyed?  No.<P>Before you start jumping onboard to make comments about how sick someone is, ask yourself if you're qualified to make those judgements.  And remember, there are a lot of psychologists that have been practicing for many years that have been wrong.

A persons freedom of speech and Expression is EXPLICITLY protected by Federal law.  I hope they Sue the heck outa Verant for this.

</FONT><HR>First of all, let me state my opinion that this move by Verant is absurd and hypocritical. Anyone been to Feerrott lately? Those dismembered dwarven corpses are still there in all their grisly glory. How about the impaled human heads in Najena, or items made of "flayed elf skin?" Absolutely nothing in Mystere's story is any more "disturbed" than these images. In fact, her fiction is very tame by contemporary standards.<P>This whole thing reeks of Verant's typical knee-jerk policy toward "offended" whiners.<P>But my main point, and something that nobody here has mentioned is this:<P>Just *how* did Verant feel it had adequately identified this "offender?" <P>Think about it - all they had to go on was a name on a message board that matched a character's name on an EQ account. They took zero steps toward verification (even granting them the right to ban people for any reason) of this person's identity; the EQ account was simply discontinued summarily on an assumption.<P>Granted, the "real" Mystere has admitted that the post is by the same person who owned the account, but Verant took NO STEPS TO MAKE SURE OF THAT BEFORE THEY BANNED HER. All of you self-righteous phonies who are applauding their actions need to think about that one, and hope nobody decides to post a similar story to some fan site using YOUR character's name.<P>Joker<BR>KAAOS  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Similarly, it is clear that copyright law does not protect simple product lettering or coloring, or the mere listing of product ingredients or contents. The exclusion of these types of materials is not an exception to copyright law, but merely an application of the requirements for copyright protection. To be protected by copyright, a work must contain at least a minimum amount of authorship in the form of original expression. Names, titles, and other short phrases are simply too minimal to meet these requirements. This is why you will often see books and movies sharing the same title. <BR>Of course, brand names, slogans and phrases which are used in connection with a product or service may be protectable under trademark law. In fact, a series of books all under the same title may even create trademark protection for that title."<P>http://www.bitlaw.com/copyright/unprotected.html</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR> All I can say is I am disgusted but not at all suprised by this. A few points - <P> Actually verant runs a SERVICE, and you folks have a SERVICE contract with them. They cannot ban people for no reason, there are some legal issues here believe it or not. If it could be proved for example that verant was banning black people or somthing they very definitely could be sued.<P> On to the meat of the issue here - This person was banned for FREE SPEACH. Believe it or not this was on a non verant controlled sight, and as such Verant's banning is very much open to question, and perhaps somewhat illegal.<P> I find it most amusing that this post wasnt deleted where it was originally placed but somehow it was inapprpriate enough to get a person banned - very disturbing. you should all carefully think, VERY carefully think about the ramifications of that - essentially Verant banned someone to squelch their free speech OUTSIDE the framework of everquest and verant.<P> Whats next? We already have bannings for disagreeing with abashi or verant, bannings for ingame activities and bannings for expressing the right of free speach. Hmm whats next? Banning people for playing other games? Banning people who vote for Nader for president? The mind boggles.<P> keep the thread alive I am absolutely dying to hear a rational arguement on this one.<P>Fkin<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>You create a game. You encourage role play. Then, when someone writes something that can be considered inapropriate, it is immediately turned around and the kid gets punished. I am not sure that the streets with all the drugs, drink and other unsavory things are a better escape and learning experience than EverQuesT can be. For that, I am truly sorry, because the likes of Verant has a golden opportunity to shine.<P>The kid has learned something about Role Playing in this game, and then it was turned around and told that it is not accepted and that's that, you can't play anymore. If I may say so, this is the same type of thing that is happening on the educational system ... it has rules and then it has procedures, but no one ever asks if this is the right thing to do, and are we helping the kid learn something from the institution instead of getting the kid to hate the school even more ... it's a losing proposition and a dis-service to the long run picture of the event and similar situations.<P>I still say, that when the chips are down, and things not right, the best people step up. I believe that those that can only think of punishment, and banishment, in this type of situation, are not the right people to be in the positions they are in. They are merely employing power play, not just making "decisions".<BR>Decisions generally involve a lot more sensitivity and attention to detail, and from what I have seen, no GM, or Customer Service Representative, that I have ever seen at Verant, has excelled at anything resembling the sensitivity required that made them look like a company that cared, and wanted to help, or wished to have some really fine relations with its customers. I think they could use improvement in this area, but this is quite normal in companies that experience really high growth ... they have not had the time to take care of these things, and they will make mistakes, sadly enough.<P>But there is precedent. No one thought that Jean Genet was any good. No one thought that Sylvia Plath was any good. No one cared for Albert Camus dark vision, so parallel to EverQuest's in many way. Everyone was appaled by Picasso's Guernica when it first appeared ... and in the end they were magnificent snapshots of the social structure and the events around the artists. I would like to suggest that Verant's stance is on the opposite side of the vicious nature of their own game where racial factions are horrible, and the game deals with them with only one option ... death. To see a story written that pretty much came to the same end and conclusion, is exactly the same thing that almost all players do in this game ... that critter took you out 10 times, and when you are high enough, you are going to take it out 10 times, and say "Revenge is sweet" ... aren't you? When you do that, how far, and different is it from the story?<P>There is, however, one thing that I wish that Verant would learn ... and it used to be called in the movie business the Deep Throat syndrome. When you take action, as in this case, you just made things worse ... you brought attention to the event. Had all the churches in the early 70's kept their mouths shut, instead of talking about it in all the pulpits and newspapers, no one would have bothered going to see a pair of porno movies. In other words, a patient manager, could have called the parent and expressed the concern, and parent would have called the ISP, and ISP would have tried to contact the site, and the article would have been removed. No more people would have seen it, and it was discreetly done away with. <P>Instead, it ends up all over the forums and many people know about it, and they take the opportunity to slam Verant. They are right to an extent, but they also are the cause ... and sometimes we have to own up to ouor responsibilities ... Verant hiding behind "it's a game, and this is fantasy", won't hold up in court too well. And, in fact, it would only hurt them and the over abundance of violence in the game.<P>I can only hope that Verant learns from its mistakes. A situation like this is better off handled in a professional matter, and quietly so. What good will the addition of more fodder for people that are trying like crazy to make Verant look bad? None. Absolutely none.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well,first of all there seem to people here getting mad because they think mystere wrote the 14 year old dark elf rape story. SHE DID NOT WRITE THAT. Here is the link to the story she wrote:<P>http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=7048656&replies=7<P>   That is the story she was banned for.This is one of the stupidest thing's Verant has ever done(and that's a big deal). They say she was banned because it was sick and demented and the like. Now,if this was a g-rated game,I would understand,but this ISN't! This game would definetly be rated PG-13,if not R. The entire game is based on mass murder for god's sake. <P>    Has the person that banned her never,ever read any of the stories of everquest. Have they EVER been to Neriak,Grobb, or Oggok?!? In all 3 of the cities, you can find DISMEMBERED ,BLOODY ,DEAD DWARVES HANGING ON THE WALLS. I have also seen head's on a stick in many places. Plus there is armor made of Elf skin. ELF SKIN!! Dark elves are evil,they do evil things,like torture. And that is all that mystere wrote about. So I would like to know, what on earth did she do wrong???????<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Umm...<P>There *HAS* to be something else we aren't seeing here... I can't imagine a company banning someone for writing something in-character on a MB that isn't even associated with Verant Interactive..  Did anyone read what she wrote? It wasn't even that bad.. I mean that's how I would picture a dark elf behaving... lol Necromancy? haha.. what a joke.. <P>If they are banning her for this, it is poor customer relations, not to mention pretty damn vindictive... I'm almost scared to log into EQ and start roleplaying..<P>How are thou doin..<BR>YOU HAVE BEEN BANISHED BY THE GODS!<P>eek...<P>This should get a response by Verant...

</FONT><HR>Hmmm, just thought of something.<P>She said 14 seasons. That doesn't necessarily translate into 14 years. When I was a level 1 Dwarf (a dwarf of the 1st season) I never assumed my character was 1 year old.<P>At any rate, it makes the story seem just a *little* less grotesque when you think of the character as a 30 year old elf (or whatever it was) who has 14 levels of experience, instead of a 14 year old...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Despite having met Mystere in person several times, I do not believe that this has any effect in my<BR>beliefs.  I thought it stupid that Verant should discourage role-playing in such a way, as was the<BR>main reason for me leaving Ultima Online, in favor of EQ.  A fellow guild member of mine,<BR>Izdaari is leaving in disgust, as are several more subscribers I am sure.  My faith in this, so far,<BR>excellent game of many months has been shaken and I'm afraid that I can no longer say that they<BR>do not discourage rping.  The main reason that I have been able to piece together from, faithful<BR>role-players posting in place of Verant workers, has been that Mystere's stories were not in spirit<BR>with the game, whether she posted them on a Verant run board or no.  I personally read the<BR>stories and although they were risqu, to say the least, I celebrate all role-players.  Should our<BR>necromancers and clerics of Cazic Thule, Innoruuk, Solusek Ro and The Warlord, among other<BR>Verant created deities, watch their backs and role-play that they are not summoning the living<BR>dead, but hopping rabbits?  Will this lead to the servants of Tunare having to be more pasteurized<BR>and summon cotton puffs?  Should Oggok, Neriak and Grobb be cleared of the dwarf corpses and<BR>blood stains?  Her stories were obviously in the spirit of the game, which is role-playing.  It is a<BR>role-play game.  Should I begin to start the role-players v. corporate empire that drove me from<BR>U.O.?<P>I would also like to see an official response from Verant (at least on the Brell Serilis server, as we<BR>lost a valuable friend and supporter), so that we might be able to discover whether they wish to<BR>discourage role-playing and suck in the dollars from frightened kewl-doods that don't like stories<BR>that deal with such risky subject matter.<P>What should we do in the meantime?  Should we spam the guides and gms with petitions?  Should<BR>we write long-winded e-mails to Verant itself, not to be answered and become frustrated?  Or<BR>should we merely quit and go to the next-best-thing.  Maybe Neverwinter Nights, or Asheron's<BR>Call?  I enjoy EQ, but I don't want to be in an rp-hostile environment, most especially in an rp<BR>game.  Perhaps I will join Izdaari sometime in the future?  I believe that only Verant may decide<BR>that for me, on their next course of action.<P>For now, I would call that they reinstate Mystere's account, as an act of good will.  Whether she<BR>accepts to pay them her monthly 10 dollars is up to her generosity.  EQ is obviously the loser and<BR>Verant may see that they will lose money, compare to keep those nay-sayers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>&gt; So I would like to know, what on earth did she do wrong???????<P>She tried roleplaying in a game where roleplaying is contrary to The Vision.  Where it is actively discouraged, in any way you can think of.  It's an understandable mistake; Verant, typical of its false advertising, makes the claim that Everquest is a roleplaying game.  It isn't, obviously, if you can get banned for it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
