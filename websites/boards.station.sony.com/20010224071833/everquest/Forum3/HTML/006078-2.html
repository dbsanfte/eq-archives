</FONT><HR>As stated earlier, the problem is with where the filtering is occuring.  Turning off all those messages only filters it client-side, the data is still being sent.   This is because its the easiest method to program, and since filters are generally for personal reasons, it's acceptable.<P>Now, for the server to filter this data instead of the client is unreasonable.  Everyone has different settings, and the server would spend an enormous time logging who gets what data, it would be unreasonable.<P>HOWEVER, I propose this possible solution.  One single command to tell the server to not send the unwanted set of data.  To explain, the programmers get together to find out which data is the main culprit.  Say it's spell info from other players, plus damage shield info from other players.   Ok, so they build a server side filter, that blocks the sending of all hit/miss, spell, and dmg shield information that does not directly involve the PC himself.  The activation command is /LowData (or whatever).  While this command is toggled on, your client won't recieve any of that other info, whether you want it or not.  No picking and choosing, cause that would tax the server too much trying to decide who gets what info.  One single filter however should be feasible.<P>As it stands, I'm almost quitting this game over this issue.  Every large encounter involves AE effects, it seems, and on nearly every large encounter I go LD.  My poor little 33.6k connection cannot handle getting spammed with hit/miss, damage shield, and especially AE effect messages from 40 people.  Therefore I go LD nearly every large encounter, and all I do is lag others with my presence.  Very demoralizing, you know?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I can sympathize with Verant saying that often there are variables that are simply out of their control when it comes to network connectivity, I know this and realize that many people jump the gun and blame Verant for their possible ISP issues. However, when half of the people in a zone start consistantly going link dead at the exact same time, not once, not twice, but several times in a very short time span, I highly doubt that it is an ISP problem especially considering that they are geographically located throughout the world and are using multiple ISP's. I suppose that you could argue that they all use the same ISP but I just don't think that retort will hold much merit. <P>The issue I have is not so much the fact that I cannot play EQ consistently without the worry of dying from going LD, rather, it is the fact that Verant has stated ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about the obvious network problems. Due to this ommission, hundreds, perhaps thousands of paying customers spend countless hours of their time downloading patches, calling tech support (of both their ISP and Verant), reinstalling OS's, etc. when Verant knows there is obviously a network problem. Even if it is a Cerfnet issue, Verant has contracted them to provide Verant's paying customers with bandwidth to play EQ. <P>I own a business and if I were to contract out some work for a customer and the contractor does a lousy job, I AM ACCOUNTABLE!!! If I blamed it on the third party contractor (in this case, CERFnet)I can guarantee you one thing, that customer would be rightfully disgusted with my UNPROFESSIONAL behavior and would not be coming back to me for more business.<P>In closing, PLEASE Verant, tell us if there are issues that you know of so that we can stop wasting our time trying to solve your problems.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I also remember at 1 time the GM's or whoever was very concered about the packet losses etc. they would would ask in game about it. Now its not our problem?? I too know that alot of players in the game from all over not using myISP that r indeed experiencing the same problems. Its not unusual that 2 or 3 or even 4 players from a group that would go LD in about every hour and its very frustrating to say the least, so I ask again, why r u dragging your feet Verant? we deserve a right and truthful answer.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just picking some arbitrary numbers to show what is happening:<P>Suppose that you get disconnected when you have 100 units of data backed up needing to be processed.  This is when you go LD.  Your client is getting too much info for it to handle, and it basicly throws up and says "I can't handle this any more.  I'm shutting down".  These units of data can be a damage hit from melee, a damage shield, a spell effect, etc.  Let's also suppose that the client is able to process 40 units of data per time index.<P>Time index zero:  Raid charges in.<BR>Time index one:<BR>  +20 damage shield messages occur<BR>  +20 melee hits land<BR>  +20 spell effects happen from AE spell<BR>  -40 units of data are processed<BR>  =================<BR>  20 outstanding units of data left<BR>Time index two:<BR>  +20 damage shield messages occur<BR>  +20 melee hits land<BR>  +20 spell effects happen from AE spell<BR>  -40 units of data are processed<BR>  =================<BR>  40 outstanding units of data left<BR>Time index three:<BR>  +20 damage shield messages occur<BR>  +20 melee hits land<BR>  +20 spell effects happen from AE spell<BR>  -40 units of data are processed<BR>  =================<BR>  60 outstanding units of data left<BR>Time index four:<BR>  +20 damage shield messages occur<BR>  +20 melee hits land<BR>  +20 spell effects happen from AE spell<BR>  -40 units of data are processed<BR>  =================<BR>  80 outstanding units of data left<BR>Time index five:<BR>  +20 damage shield messages occur<BR>  +20 melee hits land<BR>  +20 spell effects happen from AE spell<BR>  -40 units of data are processed<BR>  =================<BR>  100 outstanding units of data left<BR>  MANY PLAYERS GOES LD<BR>As players go LD the number of damage shield messages and melee hits and spell effects deminishes.<BR>Time index five + (whatever time it takes for 1/3 the raid to go LD):<BR>  +13 damage shield messages occur<BR>  +13 melee hits land<BR>  +13 spell effects happen from AE spell<BR>  -40 units of data are processed<BR>  =================<BR>  -1 outstanding units of data left<BR>(at this time, the client can finally start catching up on all of the previous time indexes it couldn't do.  You are very lagged at this point, processing info from many time indexes beforehand.)<P>Basicly the ONLY way to fix this problem is to limit the amount of info being transmitted to the client.  The current client is receiving all the damage shields and damage hits and so on, except that we can only choose not to display what has already been received.  If we could choose not to receive it in the first place, then we wouldn't go LD, as we'd have a higher data unit processing rate than the incoming data.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>If only it was feasible, I'd ask that everyone actually refrain from using EQ for one day and have it put into the public's eye.  <P>Unfortunately, that would be unrealistic - almost as much as asking Verant to actually reply on an issue like this.  If they finally do reply, they'll get hit with, "Why didn't you acknowledge it sooner?  Why have you been saying it's OUR ISPs or OUR machines?" and while they don't reply, it's merely "Where's our response?  Are you regarding the issue among the top priorities?"<P>They are stuck where you can say they are damned if they do and damned if they don't.  (as for that anal retentive GM in chat who doesn't like that word [damned], I used it properly!)<P>Personally, I'd say they would actually regain some prestige as a company who cares - but then, I'm not in their shoes.  <P>Show a little respect for customers, take the heat, take the bad press, and lose some customers.  At least you'll have a retort when someone says you don't listen.  You have a major project in the works, (Star Wars) and even as a major fan and collector - I'm not impressed by the way this has continued to go unanswered.  *shrug*  You've done a good job on portions of the game, fixing problems or bugs & have more than enough people in the game who are willing to help you recreate problems you haven't encountered personally.  <P>Another tired 2 cents...  but hopefully not wasted breath.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ester,<P>Verant advertises that you can play this game on a 28.8 or higher connection.  Turning up your data rate sets the ceiling of the amount of throughout your connection can handle.  You can set the data rate to 9.0 on a 56k modem and this may alleviate some of the problems, you still lag, and it is still unplayable.<P>Verant is missing the whole issue on link deaths.  Link deaths occur, mostly on large or epic raids, due to the fact that the packets that are sent to the client are poorly constructed.  Yes, that is the entire issue.  Filtering data ONLY filters it from your client window.  You STILL get all of the information and your connection gets congested.  THIS is what causes link deaths on slow connections (33.6, 56k, ISDN).<P>The solution, and I am sure your programmers know this, is to redesign how packets are sent to the clients, what information is in them, etc.  I can imagine that this has been passed by due to the fact that this would take a major re-write in code in order to accommodate this and that’s why we have not seen any changes.  These issues can be fixed one of the following ways:<P> 1) All of the filters need to be server side.  The packets need to be built so that messages such as hits, misses, damage shields, spells, bard songs, etc. are dynamically added or removed from packets compared to how the character filter settings are set.<P> 2) If dynamically building packets on the fly is to CPU intensive for the servers, then how about offering the users a RAID filter that allows Verant to have two methods of sending packets to clients.  One is normal method, and the other is RAID.  When RAID mode is set on, the client only gets the bare essentials needed to function.  Filters are HARD CODED so that they don’t have to be dynamically built on the fly.  <P>What Verant Fails to realize is that this reduction in packet size not only helps the user client, but it reduces the bandwidth needed to support the clients as well.<P>Just my two copper,<P>Istari, Morell Thule<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
