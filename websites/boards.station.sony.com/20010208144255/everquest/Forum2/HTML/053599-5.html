</FONT><HR><BR>I have a question for you warriors (and I sincerely hope Allan is going to read that far).<P>If tanking is your primarely activity, why in hell aren't you using a shield? <P>You are asking for HP/AC because you say the hybribs are too close to you, but yet, you are not ready to take the hit in the offensive department and use a shield? What does that mean? <P>Maybe it means that finaly, in the end, you are not really that tanking machine after all. You don't want to lose your high-damage output (yes! high!) for more AC. So, instead you ask for the hybrid to be penalyse ("Gosh! They are too close to us for tanking!" Whoa...). <P>If you really thought you were only useful as a tank and NOT a damage dealer, I'd see tenfolds more warrior using a shield. But since you are not doing that, I think there is something rotten in your requests.<P>Millean.<BR>ps. I hope it's gonna stir some discussion on that issue.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>  Wow, I wanna be a monk...or a bard...or an SK...I have been looking at their 'talk' forums, and wow, I just feel SOO much happier reading the posts there.  I mean, I see suggestions by the class in question, and a lot of 'yes, we will look in to that' or 'on the list..'  Here I see a LOT of 'NO' and 'Unbalancing.'  These things amuse me.  Why, you ask?  Well its nice to see my opinions confirmed...that I made the WRONG choice when choosing a character 51 levels ago, when I said to myself, 'yeah I wanna kill stuff with and look spiffy in platemail.  I played AD&D for a number of years, and I want to be a warrior...see right there in the manual 'masters of armed combat.' Yeah thats cool.  <BR>  I even accepted the change about level 40ish, when I realized that if I wanted to DEAL damage, I should have played a monk, or (later) a rogue.  My lot in EQ was meat shield for the casters, and taunt-boy for the monk/rogue set.  It was disappointing, but hey, they had a Vision(tm), so who was I to argue.  Too bad they wouldn't really tell us what that was, aside from Damage Sponge(tm).  OK, I was over it by the time I hit 50...<BR>  Then Kunark hit.  OK wow new armor...that NEVER drops.  New weapons...not as good as the monk/sk/pally specific weapons, but I can at least see the IDEA behind them (not that I agree with the idea, but at least I understand it).<BR>   Soloing...whats that, gave up on it at 40....I almost soloed a LOW blue at 51-that mob greened out to next level (well I killed it solo...with enchanter and cleric buffs and ending up at half a bub of life), again, no biggie, warriors arent a solo class, just wish my half cobalt-half indo set had more of an effect on the mobs hit rate or damage rate, again, no biggie, we ain't a solo class.<BR>  Then I see the other 'talk' threads starting up, and I see a lot of suggestions being met with constructve criticism, and generally the willingness to listen by those in charge.  I begin to hope that some of my concerns will be discussed...<BR>  So, finally, the day comes and the warrior thread starts...and instead of the 'feel free to suggest ideas, we may not implement them, but we want to know what YOU think' think-positive Grateful Dead, everything's-groovy vibes, We instead get 'You are a base class, balanced, and are basically doing the thread because we have done the other classes and dont want you to ***** about that, even though your suggestions are pretty much going to be ignored' (paraphrasing the meanings that came across to me reading that post initially, not its actual wording).<BR>-incidentally base has another meaning than the one you were intending...or was this what you meant by a 'base' class <BR>BASE(adj)1. being of comparatively low value and having relatively inferior properties <P>  Most of my problems with the warrior class were covered by others, namely the taunt issue, damage issue, the cobalt issue, Epic, the reason to play a warrior instead of a monk issue (hmm roughly the same ac, MUCH more damage output, ability to solo to 60, mend, fear, no -compared to warrior- need for equipment, being THE puller, not dying, MUCH faster recovery...).<BR>  As a warrior, well, I can...push attack...hit kick, tanunt, rinse repeat...Warriors dont want to be better than all other classes (well we do, but we dont expect it), we would just like some REASON to play a our class over others...some variety to out playstyles...something<P>  I would like to see somone say 'I wanna be the best [insert Vision(tm) here], and the response would be 'then play a Warrior.'  The class defining ability of Punching Bag just doesnt remind of of D&D...heck, or of Lord of the Rings, or Beowulf, Njals Saga, The Epic of Gilgamesh, the Illiad....in all of these, we see the warrior as something to be feared, in EQ this is exactly the opposite, the warrior is nice for ONE reason only...more HP than other classes, because stats are meaningless, AC, unless you get into multiple hundreds of points of variance, makes little difference, damage output is pretty low compared to any caster, and all but two melee classes (of the 4 others), and even the HP difference becomes nigh meaninless at the very high end of things.<BR>  Why would increasing warrior damage or HP or AC unbalance the entire game of EQ, when increasing the damage output of monks, or giving them stun ability (admittedly not likely to go through, but up for consideration according to the thread) not have the same effect.<BR>  We started playing warriors with Arthur, or Beowulf or Gimili as an example of a warrior, and what we thought we would be, you apparently saw Rocky Balboa as a warrior...he gets beat up a LOT, and doesnt actually win. (anything past Rocky 1 doesn't count anyway-they sucked)<BR>  <BR>  Bah, I have ranted far too long about nothing, its 4 am, Alan has long ago stopped reading, as have most smart people, so I'll quit while im behind.   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well Alan I have to ask you this... Why did you even bother to have a Warrior Discussion?  After reading your responses, you seem to have no intention to do anything, or even listen carefully to any suggestions.<P>I read that warriors can't be changed without changing the other melee classes, yet they can be improved to be more warrior like.  I've read many informed posts which clearly illistruate how hybrids are already almost as powerful at tanking as warriors, yet you clearly ignor those and indicate that Hybrids say otherwise, so they must be right...<P>To reiterate to you... Warriors and Hybrids for the most part have the same, or effectivly the same AC... No advantage there for warriors.  Warriors have roughly only 10% HP advantage over the Hybrids, an advantage that is negligable at best when we are talking a difference of 200-300 hp at high lvls and many "yard trash" mobs hit for almost that much, many boss mobs hit for more than that.  Yay, we have a one hit advantage.<P>Heck, Verant has even gone as far as giving Hybrids disciplines... So much for the uniqueness of non-casters.  Well we are unique in that we are the lowest powered class there is.<P>I've also seen you go on about your D&D character... Well this ain't D&D.  Since the removal of the XP penality I've seen a lot more groups looking for Hybrids, not tanks... Good for them, bad for us.  Why would they want a regular tank when they can get a spell casting tank.<P>In the past I've often heard it said that warriors are the fastest levelling class... Well at high lvls nothing could be further from the truth... Fact is warriors are crippled by the fact that they can't hunt without a group, often we can have trouble walking across a zone without a group even.  Therefore the other classes that arn't in groups are out picking up a little xp soloing, while Warriors stagnate, and sit unhappily "Looking for Work".<P>I really find it kind of offensive that in spite of the many informed posts in these threads that you state that Hybrids MAY be increased in tanking power, but warriors WOULD NOT be increased to compensate, while if warriors were increased Hybrids would also be increased.  Has it occured to you that maybe warriors were the baseline, but all the improvements (skills, xp, gear, etc) you've given hybrids have totally skewed them against warriors in the first place?<P>To make matters worse I've also heard a rumor that Hybrids arn't capped in their abilities from skill of 200 until lvl 51 as warriors are... I must admit I don't know this as fact, but I've recentlly started an SK (why bother playing my warrior any more when they arn't really needed, and hybrids are becoming more and more powerful the more thay whine) and intend to find out.<P>Basically though warriors are tough at low lvls, prolly the toughest up to lvl 10 or so (whoopee), they just don't cut it in the high end game, and that is really starting to become apparent to many others now that the xp penalty has been removed.<P>I'm not gonna bother to post any real suggestions to improve warriors, cause the suggestions are already there... Not that I feel any will be listened to... Sad really.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan....<P>I saw your response saying that you don't think Warriors should automatically be the master of all weapons. Ok, I can agree with you to an extent... I could see leaving the warrior piercing cap at 240... IF the rogue caps for 1hs and 1hb were reduced to 240 as well. I have no clue what a rogue's 2hs caps at, but when it comes to 1h weapons, due to the skill caps, rogues ARE the masters of weapons, and I have an issue with that since they use one type of weapon primarily to the exclusion of all others (that being Piercing of course, since it's a necessary part of their backstab skill). Since I doubt you guys are willing to nerf rogues in that manner, it'd be much nicer to just equate the caps<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Oh yeah, I almost forgot... Alan, you mention that you didn't like the idea of being able to be better at bind wound and bring it to higher hp totals instead of 50% because you don't like the idea of improving anyone's solo ability (though that's exactilly what will happen if/when hybrids are improved) but you don't take something into consideration (something brought up earlier, but obviouslly ignored)... <P>You CAN'T actually improve the solo ability of a warrior through bind wound if the warrior CAN'T actually solo a blue mobe to begin with.  As I mentioned earlier, at lvl 50+ there is much trouble even soloing many green mobs, and that's just down right embarassing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Beeing a Warrior is a great Part and I do not miss very much in Game. <P>My Warr is now Lev 49 but there is something I am missing in balance - but not in balance Warrior to another class than Warrior to Warrior.<P>The Warrior is defined as a "meatshield" for taking damage and dealing damage in a way to taunt (including the TAUNT ) the mob away from all others.<P>So we have now 3 Classes of Warrior in Game <BR>1. The Big ones ( Ogre, Troll, Barbarian )<BR>2. The middle ones ( Human, Dark Elf , Half Elf,  Woodelf )<BR>3. The small ones ( Halflings, Dwarfs, Gnomes )<P>The first two "classes" can wear Things like Tree Weave ( AC 25 10 Str ) or Hero Bracer ( AC 9 Str 10) to raise their Power and hold their AC high,<P>The 3rd "Class" is not able to wear these things and specially the Gnomes and Halflings are not the powerfull ones. They have also less HP than the big ones.<P>What I mean is that there are no special Items in game just for the small ones to raise their Malus.<P>The Hobbit has a small racial boost for leveling a bit faster than all other races but the Gnome and Dwarf have nothing.<P>I am missing some nice racial specific Items also for the smaller ones special in the part of the Equippment.<P>Maybe its the wrong place for it but I think Balancing Warriors is also a part between the Races and not always a part between the classes.<P>Look into the game and you see a part of a Handfull Gnome Warrior and hundreds of Barbarian Warrior.<P>It is looking like a joke when a 140 str barb warr can buy a 10 str boost for about 2k and a 110 Str gnome warr can take things like a Bracer of Erolsii for a  5str Boost and a 5 Item AC Malus.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>After going through Most of these posts I have come to the following conclusion to the warrior Class.<P>Crit/Crip Hits: Understand for a moment that while I have heard so far the Critical Hits are unreliable as are Crippling Blows. Please let me make something clear. In the course of a combat, A mob is considered to be always moving always trying to hit you. &lt;Mob, Blocks, Parries, Dodges, Ripostes etc..&gt; Please note that a critical hit is supposed to be a mortal blow, Removed limb, Struck in the chest/head, that is a critical hit, The maximum damage of the attack in accordance to your weapon just means that particular critical hit did not kill the thing... What's the problem. It is luck, I don't think someone would stand still long enough in a fight for me to REALLY Groin kick them. Thusly the sparcity of the Critical/Crippling blow.<P>AC Bonus for defensive tanks: I am Tank, Give me dual wield and Double attack. This is what we get people, an insane speed set of attacks and Great AC. Defensive tanks get spells. We get our AC. Leave it at that we don't need more. Uber levels are supposed to have around 1k AC anyway. I'm at 35th with a 760AC I'm a happy tank. I still get my tail handed to me. That's fine<P>Special Skills for Warriors: What are people complaining about? 17 seconds of total immunity at uber levels. 8 of those seconds are filled with nothing but instant ripostes sure there are mobs that can kick your butt for 2100 HPS of damage in a 8 seconds. WOW! you can take two streams of that while instantaniously returning fire and chancing return fire on the mob with Double attacks of your own in addition to double attack ripostes. Ever WONDERED why mobs have up to 300K HPS? Here's your answer.<P>Weapon specialization: Good plan, Warriors are masters of the art of war, Weapon specialization makes sense however it should only be in one strand of weaponry, 1HB, 2HB, 1HS, 2HS, Throwing, Piercing. Whichever, Personally I believe it should have for that kind of skill an increase in damage/to hit ratio. Not speed. I don't becomming faster at wielding the weapon. I know how to strike harder more often. Makes sense, and allows a tank to be the only real DOT class there is. Absor, This makes sense, if casters can specialize in spells, why can't we specialize in weapons. A paladin has spells and weapons, A shadow knight much the same. What makes us warriors unique? Sure got some cool kit with some funky abilities. But a warrior is still a generic hack and slash.<P>Racial warrior abilities: I don't truly believe that an Ogre &lt;still supple skined creature&gt; should have more AC than the Iksar warrior on a natural base, &lt;Scales, Versus skin. Armored skin, versus Unarmored skin&gt; Orges and the like recieve an HPS bonus. Iksar do not.<P>Taunting Issue: Good point, I'll try not to repeat myself, in realistic terms, who you going to deal with first the wizard who's casting? or the warrior who's kicking your rear end everywhere? We need a better taunt... I dunno, In addition to taunt, maybe... Preform Moon? *smiles* point made. needs to be better than the Hybrid's taunt.<P>Swords Vs Sorcery: A warrior is a warrior because of his knowledge of the weapons at hand. If the epic weapons aren't as good as others. Find better ones. May be hard to get the epic weapons and they might not be all to good. But you going to find better this side of Veshan's peek and The temple of Veshan? Not likely. It's good in comparison to what we can get. In regards to difficulty. A warrior should have to have friends help him. Not an entire server in itself.<P>25-50 lvl Problem: Interesting thought considering the skills. Agreed it's boring running through those levels without something to play with, wait... Perhaps again Specialization in weaponry. A maximum of one weapon type specializations for a warrior. at level 40 perhaps. 5 levels after disarm. Makes sense and 40 to 50 should be a bag drive. Just because we aren't getting anything new between those ten levels. Fight for it, if you want to be there, work hard and the rewards will come.<P>Disiplines: In regards to disciplines. These are bonuses that warriors came through with. I don't know how many times resistant came in handy. And Fearless WOO! no more fear kiting on me at least for that combat. Understand Disiplines are meant to be mastery skills of the warrior class. Heck how would you feel if you never had them to begin with and this thread wasn't open to discussion I think people would still be finding ways around the ubermobs of the 55+ range.<P>In closing: Warriors are balanced... YES, However the other classes are far outreaching the standard warrior because of the upgrades they have been getting. To combat that to Balance the base class to the other classes you have to be able to say when you look at the character creation screen, "Do I want to play the warrior, who can specialize in weaponry and get right into the battle and take it to the mob" OR! "do I want to play the Wizard and DD the heck out of a mob." "or Maybe I want to play a cleric and heal my tanks." "or finally maybe I want to play a shadow Knight or a Paladin because I can both use spells well and I can tank things." "perhaps the rogue who can sneek/hide and backstab?" Each class needs something to set them apart from other classes. "Ranger = Tracking and psuedo druid spells distance killers." "Druid = major tree hugging spells not much for a combat." Take a look at it now Absor, only those who want the combat and RP value now play warriors. I don't want to play a warrior because he's the best at what he does.. Because he isn't. You say it is the class to base everything off of. You have raised the bar for every other class so far, the warrior has been left behind. You need to re-evaluate what the base class is. Because I hate to tell you it isn't the base class anymore. It's more like the Wizard is. Everything is based around Damage/Magic/Kite ability. Warrior's can only do damage. Remember that.<P>Rithnok Tatsukao<BR>Samurai of the 35th Rank<BR>Test Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Regarding hit points:<BR>"That's exactly the opposite of what the hybrids, monks and rogues say… A lot of them think that there is too wide of a gap between their hit points and/or armor class and that of a warrior, and they want more."<P>This is a common misconception.  The people who say this are invariably comparing their high elf paladin to an ogre warrior.<P>There IS a significant racial difference in hit points, there is NOT a significant class difference in hit points.  (A lot of people think "paladins suck".  This is because most paladins are high elves or humans, comparing themselves to ogre warriors.  They don't seem to realize that a human warrior also has a good deal less hit points than an ogre warrior.  It's not the class, it's the race they picked that's giving them grief.  And rightfully so, since the ogre is KOS everywhere and has an XP penalty, you'd expect him to have an advantage somewhere.  Incidentally, dwarven paladins are very good.  Why most paladins are high elves and humans I just don't know.  Anti-dwarf sentiments maybe.)<P>Create a level 55 troll warrior.  Now create a level 55 troll shadowknight.  Their hit points are very close.  Now give them both Focus, Aegolism, and their Plane of Growth armor and the percentage hit point difference between them drops to about 1%.<P>But the SK can outtaunt us with spells, heal themselves, feign death, use spells to stop runners, etc.  While warrior armor is slightly higher in AC, shadowknights get SK-only one handers that are nearly as good as a two-hander, which enables them to use a shield, which in turn makes up for the AC difference.<P>Looking at same-race comparisons, they have our hit points, they have our AC, they also have spells.<P>The ONLY thing that really gives warriors an edge is our Defensive discipline at level 55, and our riposte discipline (Furious) at level 56.  A level 54 troll warrior holds few advantages over a level 54 troll shadowknight, but the reverse is not true.<P>Basically my beef is that we should either be given more hit points, or at least make some of the WAR-only shields usable in the back slot to maintain our AC lead.<P>Incidentally, I don't think you need to worry about nerfing Cobalt Greaves.  Only 1 mob drops them, he is terribly difficult and has a very lengthy respawn time.  To my knowledge, not even one of these exists on my server yet.  I doubt they will become very commonplace items.  You have to realize warriors can invis themselves at will anyway, all the greaves do is save us about 13 plat and a bag space for the potion.  I personally don't see a problem with an effect that does not help us kill things, but rather, helps us join groups (something we are lame ducks without).<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok heres some suggestions.<P>Tripple attack at lvl60. This wouldn't be that overpowered i knew it was a rumor quite a while ago and it would certainly help us taunt a lot better now that rogues get double backstab. At lvl60 it would eliminate the lvling advantage that it might have at lower levels.<P>Improved bash. This would work along the same lines of the old bash but be a lvl55 skill that would do a little more damage and stun a little longer but re-pop also a little longer.<P>Disarm. This is such a pathetic skill. It only disarms weapons that are not magical and from what i've witnessed it doesnt really change the mobs damage output at all.<P>AoE Taunt. This would seem really useful if your in battle and some mobs are attacking the casters or cleric or enchanters and you cant target them all. It would run on the same line as normal taunt and re-pop a few seconds after taunt normally would.<P>Some added advantages to using 2h would be nice. It has become almost obsolete with the exception of the epic because of the low taunting ti does compared to 2 fast 1handers.<P>-Tenaman Panophiliac<BR>59 Warrior, Innoruuk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Furious vs Fortitude:<P>You can't riposte hits from your back.  This much is certain.  I haven't personally tested this, but it stands to reason, therefore, that Furious will not protect you while running, but Fortitude will.  (I haven't tested this because at my level because there is almost never anywhere to run to -- all you'll accomplish is making CR harder.)<P>Arguing over Furious and Fortitude is like arguing over whether it's better to fight Trakanon with arrows or throwing daggers.  Neither is effective.  The recycle time on those disciplines more than cancels out the potential usefulness.

I am also of the opinion that it should be safer for a warrior to travel from point A to point B without having to worry about dying from a low blue or a green.  Sow potions have been mentioned which helps us run away outdoors.  But my new request is that u add invis potions to the shaman repitoire so that we can travel in peace and quiet.  Please remember that even though u claim us to be a "base class", without a tag-a-long we are basically at the whim of any mob that we happen to get too close to.  Please mention this to the team and try to come up with a solution of yer own if you dont like any of our ideas.<P>Thank you fro reading this<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't play a warrior (well, I have a 6th level twink).  I DO think something should be done with bash, and shield wearing in general.<P>Give Bash (not slam) a big taunt.  As it is, you almost NEVER see a warrior with a shield because, while it gives more AC, the warrior can't taunt enough to make the MOB bother with him and as such, the extra AC is useless.<P>Basically, I think the three modes of fighting: 2 1HS weapons, 1 2HS weapon, or 1HS and a shield should each have merrit.  Either make them all equal, OR make them each usefull for different situations.<P>Perhaps a shield will reduce or have a chance to even negate spells (since the melee can hide behind it).  This would make it useful against casters and on Raids where AE's are cast.<P>2HS weapons could have a greater damage (lets face it, getting hit with an Exe axe would HURT)<P>And Dual wielding would taunt the most since it is a flurry of blows (but deal less than 2hs).<P>These kinds of changes would help make choices situational...at the very least they should be equal.  Not one form or combat should be the best, or else everyone would do it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One thing I'm wondering about warriors / melee classes is why they don't have specialization like casters do (I play a caster, and I think specialization is a great way to sort of flesh out one's character making it slightly unique to the user).  Granted, there isn't as broad a range (or maybe there is) of melee skills to specialize in, but I think melee's deserve to get a bonus for going one route or another.  Say, specialize in defense / offense ... one handers / two handers / slashing or piercing weapons?  Weapon or skill specialization would a great way for warriors and melee to define themselves a bit more, and bring a little something different to the table.  Just a thought, and I'm sure someone else may have a more detailed thought process on how melee's could benifit from this (being a caster I'm not fully up on the lingo).  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

True, you can hot-swap the sheild and Bash, but at times of high lag typically during high end encounters this becomes useless.<P>Please consider raising the Kick skill max to equal the Bash skill max at 240. That still will be lower than the Monks Kick skill, and will give us small and medium warriors a more even playing field with the large races.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My name is Terq, and I play a Warrior on the Rathe Server. I spent quite some time yesterday writing down what I thought was wrong with our class, as did a lot of other folks. And to see Alan come in and post so fast telling all the warriors that we need to be nerfed. At first I did a dbl take,  then reread what he posted. Said ok sleep on this and come back in the morning. which I did, not once but three times did I read his post again, to make sure I was understanding Alan as he stated not once but twice that the warriors should be "nerfed". Come on this was not what we as warriors wanted to hear. Where did you come up with the possibilty that this class should take such a hit? Why would you take from us, when most of what folks posted was to fix what was all ready there in the game, either broken skills, unfairness in the drop rates of our equipment, or how we can't compete against any other class in the game in a duel.<P>First, let me say I truely enjoy the role of the warrior over any race, I have always believed a true warrior is a master of all things with weapons and armour. To sit here and read a post telling us that we are a balanced class and that we should take these nerfs is so totally unfair. I have over 60 playing days on my warrior, not more than some but alot of time in less than year. I have come to love the warriors role in the game as the protecter of the group. As the shield to all. We stand before all mobs and we take any and all damage so that groups can live thru the encounters. We can't take on a single blue mob past level 50 without the help of the support groups. We can't heal ourselves in battle. We can't run from the mobs as they train up on us(for if we do then the whole group dies), we die more than any other class. And to read Alan's post that we are to be nerfed hits way hard. We as warriors stand by our equpiment more that any class. Our weapons define how good we are in a fight. Yet all this means nothing to Alan. He thinks we should be less than we are. <P>How can we as warriors achieve our dreams, when the equpiment is rare and that we as warriors are forced to roll for it when it drop to any person in the group or groups? Cobalt was listed in 50% of the posts made by the warriors. Why is cobalt so rare? Why isn't it a no drop warrior only? To see a wizard or a mage say roll for it cause he can sell it and make 10 to 20k plat so he can buy what he wants, when cobalt is suppose to be for us warriors. We worked hard to get to the higher levels to be able to go to these places and reward ourselves with them. But all Alan has to say and I quote "I'm not really looking for this kind of thing, but I'll add it to the list." When all that was asked in the post was to see why the drops were 1-So rare, or 2 Not no drop. Most asked, some begged to see the cobalt drops increased. And we get a word back saying he is not looking for this kind of thing. You asked us to list what was wrong with and for our class and we did. Yet you kinda like shot us down at every corner. I ask you Alan to play a level 51 warrior in crafted armour, go to Sol B, and try to fight the bats or the beetles, or by chance a ldc. Then do the same with a 51 monk. You will see why we as warriors are begging you to get our equipment right. Then you take the same warrior and monk and duel them. I'll bet $5,000 cold hard dollars on the monk winning the fight.<BR>Lets talk about the Epic weapon for us warriors. This is what was in Alan's post::<BR>&gt;"This is further compounded by the relative difficulty of the warrior epic as compared to the others. Why the double whammy?"&lt; <BR>I don't know… I really don't think that the warrior epic is relatively harder than most. It seems to be pretty middle of the road, to me. But I'll add it to the list (along with the request that we give it haste).<BR>Alan have you looked at the warriors epic? Have you compared it to the other epic weapons for amount of time invovled? How can you say that we have a middle of the road epic when we have to involve our whole guild in raids to try for items not one or two times like other epics, but for 3 plane raids(2 of which the drops are rare 9 out of 10), 2 dragon raids, and the Queen in Chardock? We as warriors feel that its not fair to have this thrown at as so hard. Most epics don't involve their guilds to come out but one or two times to help the person get their weapon. But with warriors, believe me when I say the guilds get tired of trying over and over to help us warriors get the items we need. This is totally unfair and for you to say its a middle of the road shows you lack the knowledge of what our epic entails compared to others. We get a scabbard that takes up a inventory slot that has no ac, stats or anything to it. But look what we go thru to get this one item. It should be a back slot item with decent ac and some decent stats as a reward for the time and hard work we put into it. Then the weapons have no haste. Whats a epic weapon if there are weapons in game lots better than these? Its not balanced in the epic weapons, not one bit. These weapons should be the stand out best wepons in the game for all warriors. <BR>Then you say our AC is ah I quote you again::<BR>&gt;"Another area where Warriors seem to be a little lacking is in the AC and HP department. I am not suggesting that a huge move is needed in either of these areas, but in the high level game, there is precious little difference between a warriors AC and HP versus the hybrids and melee "wizards" (Rogues and Monks) "&lt; <BR>That's exactly the opposite of what the hybrids, monks and rogues say… A lot of them think that there is too wide of a gap between their hit points and/or armor class and that of a warrior, and they want more.<BR>Again I tell you try a 51 monk agaisnt a 51 warrior, try a 51 Sk against a 51 warrior, then do the same for every class against the warrior. See where we stand in any duel. We don't, we die. We might win in one or two classes but come on, warriors should be the best there is. We should handle any melee class hands down. and you just brush us off. Hybrid classes traded off AC and HP to have the use of spells. We traded nothing. We have our bodies to break the backs on any mob. Heh, we can't even do that alone. And the regen on warriors is, shall we say, so slow we can watch the fall turn to winter before we get back to full health. We can't do anything in the game without our groups period. Without the buffs and heals, in EQ warriors can't go very far at all.<BR>Another quote for your post::<BR>&gt;"BIND WOUNDS.... <BR>Please allow the percentage healed to increase with level. Start at 50 and by 20 let the tank be at 70% then at 30, 80% then 40 at 90% then at 50 at 100%. Do you really think it will effect balance? Heck no.. I will still be screaming for a clearic. The bind wound is nothing more for the times when you have no cleric, druid, shaman, or necro handy."&lt; <BR>Well, I'm not one to advocate something that is specifically intended to improve the solo ability of any class. But I'll add it.<BR>How is it that we ask for bind wound to increase and you say you don't to see this because you see it as giving us the ability to improve us soloing. Ah wake up here Alan please, when can we bind wound when we fight? All this does is cut into our down time. We as warriors would love not to have to sit on our butts like we do. We drain the casters more to heal us than any other class does. They put more mana into healing warriors then into most fights. We just ask to let us be a bit better in this area.<BR>You stated that you would like to see a spell effect of invis removed from one of our pieces of amour. May we ask why? Some rewards should be put out there for us warriors as we get to higher and higher levels. The invis on the cobalt in no way effects game balance. It lets warriors get from place to place without having to fight 200 green mobs on the way. How can this effect the game balance. We are slow, we have to ask for ports, or god forbid take the 2 hr long boat rides. Some warriors hardly ever leave the mainland because they don't have the time to spend traveling to the new lands. Please leave invis where it is as a reward for hard the hard work us warriors put in to get to higher levels. We lose so much time to having to fight the green mobs that this one thing  helps us out.<BR>You quote::<BR>Anyway, don't be too surprised if I don't pick a lot of suggestions from your lists. There might not be too much that needs changing.<BR>We are not really asking you to chance much at all, just fix things that are already there. We know that casters are the super damage dealers. We know that we never will have the ability to out damage most classes. But by god we ask that you respect the warriors and fix what is there so that our game can be a bit more enjoyable. Come on a level 45 necro pet can eat a level 50 warrior alive. Is this what you call balance?<BR>I don't mean to be cruel or mean in this post to you Alan, just that you kinda brushed us aside with your post to us warriors. We are a class of folks who like to get in the game and fight face to face with the critters and to have fun. But we don't want to have to always have the fear well at 48 or 49 I have to park my warrior and make another class to see the high level stuff. Give warriors what is already in the game. don't make it so that the top 1 or 2 percent get all the items and leave out the rest. We are not all in uber guilds nor do we all have time to play 12 hrs a day on the comp. Give the warriors a chance to shine brighter and better.<P>Thank you,<BR> <BR>Terq Windjammer<BR>Rathe Server<P><BR> <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>  Absor, there is a fact here that I think you may have overlooked.  That is, that at the highest levels, warriors DO NOT have an AC advantage over hybrids.  This is because of the "soft" AC cap of 1100.  In practice, hybrids and warriors alike will usually be buffed up to over 1100 ac, so the warrior "advantage" in AC really doesn't exist at the highest levels (or at least it's importance is trivially small).  This means that warriors really NEED to have a good, wide gap between their HP and defensive skill caps, and those of hybrids, at least at the highest levels.  Otherwise, the warrior tanking advantage will evaporate.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Someone above stated a suggestion I hadn't even considered and haven't seen much if any of and frankly I feel like a complete dolt for not suggesting it.  Specialization!<P>Being able to specialize in one and only one weapon type would be absolutely fantastic.  It would create a bit of diversity amongst the warriors, maybe increase their chance to hit by 5%?  Also my suggestion would be to increase the damage by just adding on a flat amount at the end of the damage calculation equal to 10% of the max damage of the weapon without str bonuses added in.  <P>So for example say you have a weapon that does 50 points per swing max at the character's current level not including any strength bonuses then if the character were specialized 5 points of damage would be added on at the very end of the calculation. 100 point hits would be kicked up to 110, so on and so forth.  10% isn't that much of an increase in one and only one weapon type is it? (Yes I'm whining for the metaphorical bone.) <P>BTW those percentages were derived from the +1/+2 specialization system of a certain game that you have made reference to Alan.  1 out of 20 and 2 out of 20. Yes I know in that game that no hand held weapons did 20 points of base max damage, but hey it's a nice round number that isn't unbalancing in the EQ system.  OH OH...and in this game I happen to be referring to only warriors (single classed..ahem...non-hybrid warriors) were allowed to specialize.  <P>The extra damage would also help with the big desire for us meatshield to take more of a beating by being able to taunt things on to us easier.<P><BR>Couple points I have to disagree with you on though Alan.  <P>The first was that a change in bind wounds would aid Warriors with soloing.  In on way yes, it would reduce downtime.  This in turn means more fun "YAY."  Two words to keep in mind that should advocate soloing to an extent, "Casual Gamer."  Again a large number of people out there don't have the time nor the inclination to find a group.  Yada, yada, yada, .....if you are interested in more reasons or info about casual gaming I'm sure there's a thread talking about it somewhere.  Bind wounds won't actually help warriors kill things they wouldn't be able to normally.  If something is going to kill a character...it's going to kill them.  If a person tries binding wounds while getting whacked that's just a wasted bandage.  Plus there is the alternative I gave earlier about just changing it so everyone can bind wound's to 75% or so...maybe just 60% instead of 50%?  <P>The second point I disagree with you on is the reasoning that warriors as a base class are assumed to be already pretty much balanced.  All classes should be balanced.  Just because Warriors, Druids, Clerics, and Necros are base classes by no means necessarily means that's true for them.  Basically it looks like you've entered this thread with a preconceived notion that warriors are fine and won't need much work.  Big mistake there no matter what the situation.<P>Preconceptions in general are bad...always keep an open mind.  Hear the arguments, look at the evidence, then decide.  <P>I would have to agree that Warriors are pretty darn good as is.  Mine is fun, I don't think he's over balanced currently (again only level 35.)  I can taunt off of other melee's okay, casters sometimes give me trouble.  I have a nice amount of hps.  My AC is just under (within 10 points or so) that of a self-buffed Paladin of my level.  <P>Boy oh boy though I would REALLY like that specialization thing.  That would just be cool frankly.  If we did get it I have no clue what weapon style I'd take it in.  <P>Just remember Absor...warriors need love too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm just going to say this one thing, since most everything else has been said enough, and Absor managed to almost completely ignore this issue.  Two-hand fighting over 50, even much lower, is completely worthless.  Two slow to taunt, worlds below one-handers in damage, and the one change that tried to help accomplished very little.  I'd love to wield a huge axe, as it's my personal Vision of what a dwarf should use, but not only is the 2h axe selection pitiful, i would get thrown out of groups if I refused to go to 1h for the taunt factor!  Not only should you increase the taunt factor for 2h weps, you need to either seriously bump the ratios, or give a better base damage modifier so weapons of comparable difficulty to obtain are similarly damaging.  Tehr Rod of Lamentation I picked up is neat and all, but a Wurmslayer and my Amy whip, FAR easier to obtain, would do more damage, not to mention much more of a taunt.<P>Lets see some changes to make two-handers a viable choice, not just an expensive way to let the rangers die since we can't taunt off them  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>-Grimsek Kal`Tarak, 54 warrior<BR>-Tannin Kal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, I have an explanation for why some warriors say they can taunt well and some can't.  There really is a problem here, but it only exists in certain situations.  There are two reasons why some warriors in this thread don't think there is a problem:   <P>1. It depends on the level of the mobs that the warrior is trying to taunt.  When my warrior was level 50-55 or so, I hunted in Karnor's almost exclusively.  The typical mob you fight there is low 40's in level.  If you had done this class-issues thing (great idea, btw!  Thanks for doing this) back then, I would have posted here telling you that warrior taunt was fine.  As I got higher in level, though, I moved on to areas that had higher level mobs and then I started to see a problem.  The trouble is that against higher level MOBS (and I'm not speaking just of ubermobs here -- I mean normal, everyday nasties in Sebilis and other places), taunt just has too low a probability of working.  <P>2.  It depends on who the warrior is grouped with.  You have to realize how taunt works.  It moves the warrior (or paladin, or SK, or ranger) to the top of the mob's hate list, but only BARELY.  When taunting off a caster, this works fine, as long as the taunt roll is successful, because the caster usually just nukes for a bajillion point of damage and then sits back down.  Taunting off of monks or rangers, however, is another ballgame completely.  These guys outdamage us AND HIT JUST AS FAST OR FASTER than we do.  This means that they get lots of chances to jump over us on the mob's hate list AFTER our successful taunt roll but BEFORE the mob's next attack.    <P>  Equipment does indeed make a difference.  Dual wielding fast 1H weapons that proc is the best way for a warrior to taunt.  But even when you do this, there is still a big problem in the situations I describe above.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Mr Absor,<P>I have read your replies to the various warrior issues and I must say I don't think you are looking at taunt correctly. It is not a wish list issue, this is a balance problem. You say the warrior is the base melee class and any changes made to the warrior will create balance issues for other melee classes. This is possibly true with other issues but this is completely not true when it comes to taunt. Here is why:<P>Warriors have ONE way to taunt the mob, we push the taunt button. Paladins, SK's and Rangers have spells they can cast which move them to the top of the agro list. Fix our taunt to balance our tanking ability with the other classes. You say we have more HP's and more AC and are working as intended, fine but we have to have a way to get the mob to pay attention to us. Don't shrug off this issue, it's without a doubt the single most important skill a warrior has and if it doesn't work, we don't work.<P>Also, you conveniantly ignored all the posts regarding the AC soft cap. What is the point of continually releasing higher and higher AC items if this stat is capped? If you can't fix the cap then at least get some more resists or stam on the armor instead of giving more and more AC which you already know doesn't have any effect beyond 1100.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'd give my right leg for two things --  Shields as back wearable for warriors and the SLAM ability for all size warriors.<P>For me, the slam makes sense.  Large races get it as a RACIAL ability.  A shadow knight, rogue, shaman and warrior can slam.  Okay, fair enough.  But I think being a natural fighter would enable ALL warriors, no matter the size, to slam.  Large race warriors already have enough bonuses over the medium and small ones as to where this wouldn't give anyone an unfair advantage.  Ogres can't be stunned from the front.  Trolls get regeneration. - both have ungodly melee stats.  And barbarians are a mixture of good faction and good melee stats.  All three have anywhere from 300 to 500 more hit points than the 'smaller' warriors at level 60.  Plus bash for warriors has a really good cap (WAY above kick), but small warriors never get a chance to use it (without clicking many times a fight via ghetto bash; so, it's really for convience purposes).<P>As for the shield on back..... well, it may be a little overpowering, but I'm sick of passing over really good warrior shields because I would quite literally never use them (unless I'm gonna ghetto bash, which I do not do because it makes my hands hurt from so much clicking)  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>There are other small changes, but none of those really stand out in my mind.  Cobalt drops for helm and bracer really are kind of bad.  The effect on cobalt gloves is rather useless (why not something like summon bandage - certainly not the CORE of the mage class!)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt;Cobalt Helm and Bracer -- Again, ditto what &gt;everyone else has said about the drop rates. <BR>&gt;<BR>&gt;I'm not really looking for this kind of thing, &gt;but I'll add it to the list. <P>Absor, I must respectfully disagree with your outlook on warrior equipment issues. Warriors are 100% dependant on equipment. To have a discussion about warrior issues is going to have to include equipment. Other classes get spells and whatnot at regular intervals. This is primarly what increases the power of these classes over the span of their careers. Warriors upgrade power through equipment alone. Please reconsider your view on looking at equipment for our class as it really is the way in which warriors balance their capabilities with all the other classes.<P>With that in mind I see a few problems with warriors and equipment. This causes a balance issue.<P>1. The drop rates are terrible for warrior high level armor. I mean BAD. This translates to our gear costing 2-3 times as much as other armor wearing classes. Case in point. The drop rate for Bard boots is so high they sell for 2k and you see most bards over 40 wearing a pair. Warrior boots, which drop in the same place (Karnor) sell for 10K+ due to such a low drop rate. So we have a difficult time getting our armor compared to some of the other armor wearing classes, yet the game, at high levels, basically requires us to have this armor. This becomes a catch-22. There really needs to be a more level playing field for armor in this game.<P>Solution- Increase the drop rates on cobalt and/or have the pieces drop off more than one kind of creature. (besides legs and BP, those are special and should come off boss mobs.) Put more types of armor in the game with incremental improvements. Why is it that the Velious armor is basically the same level as Cobalt. The gap in armor is between Planar and Cobalt. There really should be armor type that fall in between these two ranges. This is an issue for all armor wearing classes, not just warriors. We just happen to feel it a bit more.<P>2. Two Handed weapons. This has been mentioned before in this thread but I would like to really make a clear statement. High level players do not use the uber 2handed weapons that are in the game. There is no point. While it can be argued that a really nice 2 handed weapon can SLIGHTLY outdamage 2 uber one handers, the ability to taunt is terrible. If the 2 handers did a lot more damage than one handers, it would be great. It would make a warrior have to choose between damage output and taunt ability. But since the damage output of 2 handed weapons is marginal at best, there is no reason to use all the really nice weapons put into the game. The other alternative has been suggested before in this thread. Increase the taunt factor with 2 handed weapons. It really is a shame that so many of the really neat weapons in the game are rarely used because they are ineffective.<P>Our taunt ability is a seperate issue. It has been covered in depth already. I do have one other suggestion on taunt. Increase the skill cap from 200 to say 250 for warriors. Move the hybrids taunt caps up by 50 as well. That way everyone's taunt ability increases yet it still maintains a balance between warriors and the hybrids. I.E. all the tank classes benefit from better taunting abilities and remain in balance.<P>Thank you Absor,<BR>Baarak Orchammer<BR>Innoruuk Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan,<P>You missed one thing.<P>The effect on cobalt guantlets.<P>It takes 12 seconds to cast, and is useful for about 24 seconds.<P>The real digger is when you get Cobalt boots, the effect on the boots is much better, and will not work with the guantlets effect.<P>At the very least make it so the effects stack, or ideally just change the effect to a useful one. summon bandages was a good suggestion i heard.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I meant to add in the above post that Caster spell drops where reviewed in the caster issues discussions you have already held. Warrior equipment drops are the exact same balance issue as caster spell drops. Please do not discount item drops as part of our class discussion.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>two questions/idea<P>one, I think disarm could be a useful skill, if it actually prevented a MoB (outside monk MoBs) from dual wielding.  If the Orc I am fighting is a warrior class, and I disarm him, it knocks the weapon from his primary hand, but it does not decrease his effectiveness in battle.  If disarm knocked the secondary weapon from his hand, it prevents him from dual wielding (or so i think from what I have read in the past from Abashi/Absor) and thus lowers his fighting abilities. Maybe its a balance issue, I don't know, but it atleast seems logical.<P>second,  hybrids were recently changed so that casting does not reset thier melee combat timers.  This has been a wonderful change, but I want to know if this also holds true for pure melees as well, in the instance of using an item spell effect with a casting time.  One example is Ice Forge Shackles which can cast Velium Shards, for a hybrid, this is great, because it will not reset the combat timer, does this also hold true for warriors?<P>thanks for the info Absor,<P>M_Carnage</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 11 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-11.html">11</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053599&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053599&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
