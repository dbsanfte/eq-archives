</FONT><HR>I love the earlier suggestion someone mentioned. Just make ignite bones turn the mob semi transparent like a ghost, and also allow it to be affected by the expulse dead type spells or any other undead only spell. That takes care of the targeting problem and lets us deal some blasting during raids. As for the lich series, LEAVE IT ALONE. At high lev we have to give up say 600-800 hp just to be able to cast 1-2 more high mana spells.....almost not worth it as it is now.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

If I can land my Ignite/Chill Bones upon an epic mob then guess what?  You can land your Fire based DD aswell.<P>"and has a pet.. but wait.. you have a pet too..."<P>Oh but wait.... My pets are not immune to Fire, Poison and Cold based attacks like yours.  What pet do you use against the Queen in Chardok?  I bet it is the Fire Pet.  Funny my pet dies in 3 AoE waves while yours is unaffected.  Seems you under rate that advantage but I do not.<P>"Chanters? Boss mobs? they buff the party up and tuck thier head between their knees and pray"<P>Guess what?  This maybe hard to understand but Chanters are a 'Buffing' Class.  They know that going into the class...  <P>"Where as your pet can still do some damage"<P>LOL.. Yep if he survives a couple seconds against the massive AoE attacks and does not 'piss himself' from the sight of that dragon.  <P>"why not look at a mage who doesnt do jack on a uber level raid except buff his lil pet and give damage shields and mod rods."<P>And why do you think you had a 'Magic talk' thread?!?  Did you not address that issue in that thread?  If not then that is your problem and not ours.  So take this lollipop and go home.<P>"What you think a druid does? Tosses a wuss heal.. and casts off a nice big fat druid nuke."<P>Umm.. Our guild Druids where able to land DD spells upon Woushi when we fought him 2 weeks ago.  Guess what?  I was not able to land a Tap...<P>"So.. read a little better.. and think a tad before jumpen up and down and crying to mommy."<P>Ouche... Now my feeling are hurt :P <P>Bril<P>Love these trolls.  Boy do they just come out of no where for Necro topics.  If they at least had some facts to back them up...

</FONT><HR>Absor, <P>Respectfully you missed the point of many Necros.<P><BR>Ignite Bones: <BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The issue is the effect and stackability. One Necro in an entire raiding party is useless with DD.  Increase cast time if you wish, but dont make the effect cause it to be non-stackable.<P>Lifetaps: The number one request is to allow Lifetaps to land on the big monsters. If we are telling necromancers that they have a valid place at the final encounter because they can give mana to other casters, then they will need a way to regain mana.<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Good point....but Necromancers are resigned to being mana pumps.  We are the masters of undead and a terror to all...uh yeah.   Really give us more of a function in raiding parties.  Many have left the class for this reason<P>A Screaming Terror upgrade or real debuffs landable would be appropriate.<P>DoTs and corpse poofing: This affects everyone. Hopefully this is now much improved, but I’m not taking it off the list until I’m convinced it has been fixed.<P>Mana transfer: Again, if their ‘place’ against the boss mob is to transfer mana, then perhaps we should allow them to do it at a better rate. A<BR>2:1 transfer rate might be enough.<P>&gt;&gt;NO Necro wants to be defined in this way. None...<BR> I'm not at all certain that this should be done in conjunction with any change to Lifetaps in those encounters, though, as a change in one makes the other far more effective and might just be too much of a change. But this could certainly be considered if we fix the bug with the Lich spells.<P>Infusion: Make infusion targetable. The necro might still see it as a 'worthless spell', but if another caster wants to sacrifice their experience for 1000 mana, they might actually cast this spell. Otherwise, those Essence Emerald’s will only be used for raising the dead.<P>Defoliation: There seem to be plenty of plants that this just doesn't work on. I fully understand how we need to limit the use of any spell that is overly efficient against any one monster type. But it might be worthwhile to evaluate the things that are not considered plants that maybe should be. I've asked the players for a list that they'd like reviewed, but I've received nothing yet.<P>Track Corpse: Broken spell. Is it going to stay that way?<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Fixed..nice job btw.<P>Epic Weapon: The look and effect are not well loved in the community.<P>&gt;&gt;Personally not my biggest issue.   The duck is silly, you could do better.  But there is so much more wrong.<P>Lich Series: This series of spells is broken. It is more powerful than it should be. It takes the necromancer's hit points and turns them into mana. It was calculated at a certain ratio to be 'in balance'. Unfortunately, these spells were adversely affected by the reduction of damage to spells used by players on players. This change also reduced the hit points taken from the necromancer by Lich spells, so that the ratio of mana gained for hit points lost is nearly 1 for 1 (instead of about 3 for 2). This is a bug that we have chosen not to change in the past because it would be a 'nerf'. I think in conjunction with a serious look at the entire class and the balance of all the classes, we should also look at this series and decide if we should put it right. <P>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Alan...You forogt about pets....Explain to me why an undead would not have a greater resistance to fear?  Necro pets are useless against any kind of fear.  Necros should have the least fearable pets if you think about it.  Even from a balance issue it makes sense.<P><BR>Alan<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>-Ok let me Explain somethng in the first place about Necro healing...we were not meant to be Healers that is a Cleric duty bestowed upon clerics. Giblin do you realize how much a Necro loses in mana/hp's in this process?<BR>-As far as our Lich type spells I think that they are fine and should not be changed.<BR>-Our ability to Lifetap things is good but the cast time on them is horrible. And then to have a life tap resisted is another thing.<BR>-Ignite Bones, I feel that the image should be changed to a bigger skelly or something cool that wouldnt throw off tanks in group to much. The Damage(500) on this nuke is kinda low condiering it is our last real nuke being a lvl 44 spell..maybe if the spell had a low Dot type effect added to it would be nice.<BR>-High level mobs in a group situation and a Necromancers ability to make a dent in its life bar is poor. <BR>- Our dots do not act fast enough to to do much damage. Either that or they do not do enough damage per tick.<BR>- Group Dmf is a great idea<BR>- Group Feign death is a great idea<BR>- Being able to target gather shadows is great idea.<BR>-Being able to target Shadow sight is a great idea<BR>- here is my idea...How bout a Necro nuke that Drains mana. Not a high damage nuke or anything but one that can drain mana from a boss or Npc which would make us very group efficient hehe.<BR>Thats all i can think of at the moment...I will have alot more to come : )<BR>Smatik <BR>Tarew Marr<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I'll try and keep this short:<P>- Please add see invis to the Shadow sight spell. It's supposed to be an upgrade to deadeye, and that spell has a see invis component. Right now when I have shadow sight on me (and I play an Erudite, I prety much always have it on) and my group decides to invis up and head somewhere else, I can't see them cause I can not overwrite shadow sight with my deadeye spell.<P>- Increase the places where we can buy coffins, and reduce their cost. This spell already costs a ton of mana, why does it also require an expensive and hard to get item when a fairly similar spell, call of the hero, costs mana only?<P>- Defoliate. The 34 plant only dd is not in the game, please look into this.<P>- Research drops in Velious. I like exploring that place, but after 10 levels of hunting there I think it's safe to say that there are absolutely no research components dropping anywhere there (not in Iceclad, Eastern Wastes, Great Divide and Crystal caverns anyway). Please adress this. I love hunting there, but now I have to go hunt back in Kunark or the old world to get my words? Bah<P>- Feign Death and ST.. please give us an upgrade to at least one of these 2 spells, as they really are the only way for us to save ourselves when things go bad.<P>And finally a plea to please reconsider our roll on big encounters. All of our lives necro's, druids and mage's (if I forget a class here, forgive me) do damage, and lots of it. It's what the classes are about. Please allow all of us all to keep doing damage, it's what we liked about our class, it's why we played it for so many hours to get to the high levels and these high encounters.<P>Thanks, and sorry for making this longer than I had planned :)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ignite bones;<BR>One idea is in me about this problem.<BR>Remove Chill Bones and add a new spell of Shock of Poison line to a level 55.<BR>This spell has the initial damage of 450, and DOT damage of 100/12sec. If it is this, Chain Casting is not made and the problem which Ignite Bones has is also avoided. of course, Corpse poofing -- it is a premise that the bug is repaired.<P>Life tap;<BR>As other men have pointed out, the true problem about Life tap is that,,,<BR>"NECROMANCER is a OFFENSIVE Caster, but it cannot demonstrate ability."<P>Mana transfar;<BR>I really hate these spells. <BR>Necromancer steals Strength, AC, Life and experience(Sacrifice!) from others. Therefore, the resident of Norrath dislikes these thieves. The direction of the capability of which others are deprived matches Necromancer rather than it gives others Mana. Although I dont say give us mana tap, please stop thinking that the priority of Necromancer is in Mana Dumping. <P>Infusion, Trucidation;<BR>these Spells were designed very thoughtlessly.<BR>Infusion should be made to be castable to others. Even if it changes such, I cannot think that there are ppls who use this.<BR>Change the name of Trucidationthe to Finger of Death, and,,, change to the effect like Disintegrade in Wiz 60th. (but maybe no one will use that...Broken Designes)<P>Defoliation;<BR>Every Punks,,, VI is positive to this issue, cuz they changed some NPCs. At least, Mycoids in sebilis are landed by defoliation.<P>Night only spells;<BR>Useless spells except Levant. Who is the m***n person prepares the night only spell for the pinch?

</FONT><HR>If you're going to nerk the Lich line, PLEASE do not start until lich itself. With dark pact and allure of death, the increase in mana is barely noticable. Call of Bones is the first obvious spell that makes juggling hp and mana enjoyable. That is my favorite part of a necromancer, that we have control over how much mana and hp we have. This is the only think that makes me useful in a group at my level (36 now). And finding a group sucks as it is. I hunt in overthere, and plenty of people have rejected me from a group because i'm just useless. I have pleyed a druid to 50 and another druid to 35 when i got tired of them, so i went for a change. <P>I really love necromancers, but you need to realize that some people like the ability to solo effectivly. Grouping will ALWAYS be better exp for me. i've tested it and it is ALWAYS a lot better and safer for me. <P>So far, the net changes to necros seem to be nothing but a big nerf. you might let us give mana to others better or eat life from big mobs better, but if lich sucks, then it doesn't matter. By the way, you forgot dark pact in the line of Lich spells. I do NOT want to be a warrior, cleric, or enchanter, desipite the fact that these classes are considered the "only" good classes for a good group. I like being different and having unique skills. <P>Right now, i would be thrilled if you just left Call of Bones as is and maybe just fix the plant spell (and fix the animal spells for druids also. those big monkeys all over velious are definitly animals!) and it would be cool if we got track corpse as a skill, like a druid/ranger's tracking skill. <P>Just about every other class got changes that helped them out, even got other classes a little mad. I seriously can't see any classes being really upset if we were even left as is. We aren't going to be replacing anyone anytime soon (we can't heal well at all, our nukes are very weak, our pets can't dish out as much damage as mage's, we can't give mana like chanters/bards can especially since they have thier own specialties, our crowd control is very bad, we don't melee, can can't buff or even invis, except for self, our rez is quite costly) Our only real redeeming qualities in a big dungeon are summon corpse, and maybe DMF. In a group, there is the fear kiting option, if it's an ourdoors zone, and from my expirience last night, it's just as effectife as not fearing them.<P>It just doesn't seem fair that most other classes are being improved, and we're getting nerfed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Most monsters get 3 or 4 rounds of attacks on me before i can get a spell off, which 80% of the time is interupted.  I often prefer lower level spells merely for the reason of casting time.

What happens to necros when you "fix" it? It effectively reduces the power of EVERY SINGLE SPELL the necro owns, especially the lifetap and mana dump series'.<P>If you guys DO go around changing this, you had best balance it with some major changes to our group appeal. If being so weak post-50 was the "price" for our power to solo, and you're going to nerf that power, it makes sense that we get some swanky new "group friendly" toys.<P>If you don't think this proposed change isn't a major deal, go do some math. Calculate how many spells a necro will have to cast to keep himself alive to maintain the usage of lich.

</FONT><HR>I don't think having feign death castable on others would be a good idea.  I see many ticked off people yelling at the necro, blaming him for their death because the feign didn't work and he was stuck on the ground while the mob continued to wail on him (not everyone played a necro/monk before their warrior and knows how to get up).  Feign isn't 100% and although it's saved my butt many times, it has also failed a few too.  <P>If it was a clickable buff that would allow the person to feign when they wanted to (within a certain amount of time), I'm all for it.<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Since I mainly solo, and don't have much raid experience, I'll target my comments at Lich.<P>The Lich line has had its current effect for over a year (ever since the 33% damage reduction patch to PvP spells). <P>In that time, I'm positive that you guys have balanced mobs and encounters to take its increased effeciveness into account. <P>I would strongly urge you to not make negative changes to this spell line. Necros rely on it. It allows those of us who like to solo to do so effectively, and the price we pay is to be less effective than other classes on large scale raids.<P>The spell line is not overpowering - as another poster said, while it's more effective than C2, the difference isn't all that large. In fact, while soloing, I've found C2 to be _more_ effective, as I don't have to use my inefficient lifetaps as often, resulting in about the same rate of advancement without the risk involved in starting fights while low on health.<P>Bear in mind also, as another poster said, that Lich takes our health away quite fast enough, thank you very much. At 50, I have 950 or so hitpoints when buffed with Arch Shielding. Lich can put me down under half health _very_ quickly. If I am medding to full after a bad fight, I'm dangerously low on health when I go to start the next fight. That should be risk enough - I've certainly died enough times when the mob I pull next resists darkness and kills me in two rounds of combat.<P>It should be possible for you to positively balance necros for raid situations without nerfing Lich. Remember, that many of us don't do raids very often, and pre-50 most necros probably solo.<P>I agree with the people who don't like the fact that we are just considered to be mana batteries and corpse summoners. It would be nice if we had more offensive abilities on raids. If you consider Lich to be overpowering in those situations, have us be less effective than other offensive classes in those raids, while still giving us more than we have now. <P>I think that's all. To re-iterate though, don't nerf Lich - it's relied on by us, and has been for a long time now. It is balanced in its current form, it just is more effective than originally intended - but I believe that originally the penalties for using it were too harsh.<P>Look at it in conjunction with Clarity 2 - if a necro has C2 on, he can advance at the same rate as if he were using Lich because he doesn't have to cast high-mana cost lifetaps to heal himself as often. Don't ruin solo play to fix a perceived problem at the raid level.<P>Mantik</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>first of all,thanks for starting the necro talk.<BR>here are my ideas to fix this class,which is broken in raids,as a 57er necro.<P>1)we need faster dots.just compare our best dot in a party*which isnt stackable with other similar dots*eb makes 800 damage indoor in 42 seconds,while the wizzards can chain cast and stack their ice comets.our dots loose to dds in the high levels,because:<BR>-they have a poor stacking ability.<BR>-they have a long duration.on the other hand,indoor fights are very fast and the mob falls after 30 seconds.<BR>-they are NOT better at mana/damage ratio,when you cant fear the mob,because they do only 66%damage in this situations.<BR>arnt we the masters of dots?just compare our dots with the shaman/druid dots.their dots are faster and make more damage.decrease the durations of all our dots*except darkness-line*to 42 seconds or lesser.actualy,when a shaman or other necro is in my party in sebilis,i cant use a dot,when he/she casts envenoment bolt.shamans and druids can nuke much better,but we depend to our dots,because we are not a nuker class.<P>2)make deflux unresistable on ALL mobs in the game.that sounds fair to me.look please..a rogue backstabes a ubermob for 1000 damage every pair seconds and that is more unballanced then allowing us to cast a expensiv spell and make 310-320 damage to a mob with 300k+hp.<BR>also,we can regain our hp back by using lich and so we can feed our mana to the clerics.regeration-type spells dont help us here,when a mob casts a 500damage aoe spell.we need our hp back imidiatly and not 20 hp/tick.<P>in the other hand,thouch of the night can be removed/resisted by ubermobs so the wizzard comunity is happy.<BR>that wouldnt add  ANYTHING to our soloing abilites too.<P>3)change the useless effect of our dds,so they are allowed in raids and also,they should stack together.500 damage is not unballanced,when a mob has 300k+hp.rogues are the necromancers of meele?then we should be the rogues of the magic.<P>4)i agree,that lich is broken at this moment in pvp.it would be a only fair to bring it to the same level of power against npcs.<P>5)our pets.<BR>-actualy,they die in the first or second round of the aoe spell of the boss mobs.<BR>-they are extremley easy to fear/charm/mezz<BR>-they are NOT allowed in most of the raids because of the pathing problems.<BR>-even,when they are allowed,thir damage output is extremley weak against a 65er dragon or other boss mobs.<BR>possible solutions:<BR>-increase their damage output.its laughable after the dual-wield nerf.<BR>-raise their resists against fear/charm/aoe spells please.it would be correct from the roleplaying sight,when a undead monster has higher resists to spells.atleast it would allow us to use the pets in more raids.<BR>-do something about the poor pathing*espacialy indoor*maybe a /pet stay close command,so our pet hugs <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> us and follow us even when they are attacked.the high level pets should have a better controll ability then our low level pets.<P>one last note about the pets:<BR>dont overestimate the damage output of a mid40er pet*pet level*against a 65er dragon please dear meele-classes.<BR>actualy,my 56er pet is only a weak dot,when i compare its damage output with monks/warrior/rogues..even hyberids in my sebilis parties.with taunt on,its dead in 10 seconds.just dont overestimate our high level pets.<P>6)our epic.i know,its not the pint of this topic,but please change its effect to something usefull at 55,when a necro can get it:<BR>-a high damage lifetap,which isnt resisted by ubermobs.<BR>-a monster dot with high damage and low duration.<BR>-a good focus item*better then the book*<BR>-a FREE conjure corpse*coffinless and manaless*<BR>-a monster undead pet*maybe a ghoul or so*<BR>such a epic should be worth to make the hard quest.all epics should be looked in after the class talks please.<P>7)our plant dd.remove it or change it to something usefull*maybe more plant mobs?*<BR>actualy,we can hit only few mobs with the spell and also mobs,which look like plant.mobs.same thing with our undead spells.trakanon is a UNDEAD dragon,but when i cast undead dds,i get this messege:this spell works only against undead monsters.<P>8)essense emerland.remove all ee-spells except convergence.noone use our other 2 ee spells yet.<P>9)conjure corpse.i am 57 and have this spell,so it wouldnt change anything for me,but 57 is too high for this spell.clerics get their best spell at 39 and we get our most usable spell at 57?<BR>just think about that:a 56er necromancer cant summon better then a 56er sk.is that ballanced?<BR>a 56er cleric can heal better then a 56er paladin.also,paladins get the 49er cleric ress at 59,while sks get summon corpse at 50.i have no problem with that,but lower the level of conjure corpse to 54 or 55.<P>just one final note.i cant see,that we are overpowerd at 55+ like some trolls say.we know all,that soloing is dead in the high levels*i speak about 55+.it sucks because of the xp and loot,also its extremley boring,because the number of zones is extremley limited*only skyfire comnes in mind*<BR>necromancers are powerfull soloers,BUT when our soloing ability is broken after 55,we should get more power in raids/groups to ballance that.<BR>we are a offensiv caster class and i see no reason,why this role should be changed to a manastone in the biggest part of the game.*you need much more time from 50 to 60,then from 1 to 50*<P>also,other classes can solo equal or better in some zones then necros and they still playing their primery role in the raids.<P>its just extremley rude from verant,when we play our necromancer,because its called a offensiv class*check the official faq please*only to see,that our role changes to a weak support class in the high levels*<BR>i checked the number of 55+necros at the solosek ro server 2 days ago in the prime time*over 19ßß players there*and i saw 6!!!high level necros.this class will die out,when you dont fix it after all this nerfs in the past.<P>thanks,<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor & Necro's READ ALL OF THIS ONE! I have some very important points and some of them are lower in the post.<P>Please do not change the Lich line. Here's why;<P>Goal:  Increase Necro Value on Raids<BR>Suggestion: Let Necro's land taps on Uber MOB's.<BR>Your Solution: Nerf the Lich line to balance this out.<P>Outcome: You will nerf all lvl's of Necro's to impliment a fix that will only help lvl 60's.  Here is why it is only lvl 60's.  The MOB's in question are those such as Venril.  If we could land taps on him it would only effect those who are lvl's 58+ because in order to land a spell on that lvl of MOB (60+) you will really need to be at least lvl 59. Also We do not get a BIG tap till lvl 59 (700pts)  Even if you could land a spell on the MOB at an Earilier lvl the amount of the Tap (300pts) is really not going to make a big difference.<P>Necro's xfering mana during buff time for uber encounters will lose value.   This is Because the group is not pulling mobs at this time. We do not have anything to TAP. Typically Druids Shaman Heal us while we Xfer mana to Clerics.  The efficientcy of this will be lost if you nerf the Lich line.<P>Currently if I do not tap something in 4 min at lvl 54 I will be too low on hp and have to drop Lich.  If Lich starts doing double the damage I can only use this spell for about 2 mins and then I will have to drop it.  All necro's will switch to Clearity instead. <P>I understand that the spell is not as intended but as it turns out the spell IS balanced if you look at it in practice.  Also the Mana Xfer was made with the current balance in mind.  Do this and you will ruin us for Mana Batteris. Thus LOSS of Value on Raids.<P>Bottom line.  We lose on every front;<P>1) All necro's will be nerfed to implament a highend lvl problem.<P>2) The Value of Necro's on Raids will go DOWN because we cant give mana efficeintly anymore.<P>3) An entire part of our Class will be lost as we have to switch to Clearity instead of Lich.<P>My Solution:<BR>#1.) Allow Trucidation to be Unresistable. (now wait, hear me out)<P>Current Balance;<BR>Here are the specs on the spell.<P>Name: Trucidation <BR>Level: 60 <BR>Mana: 375 <BR>Class: Alteration <BR>Purchaseable: No, Level 50+ Spell Drop <BR>Approx Spell Cost: Unknown <BR>Researchable: No <BR>Component Needed: Essence Emerald <BR>Number of Components Needed: 1 <BR>Cost of Component: 16pp <BR>Type: Single Target Direct Damage Lifetap <BR>Max Duration: Instant <BR>Casting Time: 5.9 seconds <BR>Recast Time: 15 minutes <BR>Actual Effects: Target: Decrease Health (1100) <BR>Self: Gain Health (1100) <P>Essance Emeralds are VERY hard to get and no Necromacer at this time would waste one on this spell when he can cast the next closest Lifetap (Touch of Night) for 720pts of damage. This spell will not be used. Any Necro would keep those stones for Rez's even if he's 60 so that he could FD and rez the cleric if things went bad on a raid.<P>Proposed Balance;<BR>Here is what would happen if this spell became unresistable. <P>I.) The spell already has a 15min recast time.<BR>This solves a couple of issues;<BR>a.) It prevents this spell from being exploited in a soloing environment. (also on soloing; Necro's are not going to waste Essence Emeralds on a solo mob because they are going to be soloing mobs that spells will land on. Thus, they would use touch of night instead)<BR>b.) It does not take away from the Wizards Lure line of spells because of the recast time and the component cost. For the Necro the spell is very ristrictive compared to the Wizzy. Necro MUST be Lvl 60, MUST have the spell (drops off Uber mobs btw), MUST have an Essance Emerald, and is only good for 1 Cast per Uber mob because of the recast time compared to the Wizzy's many casts.<P>II.)Necro's will be wanted for group.<P>III.)A lot more poeple get Sacrificed as Necro's begin to aggressively persue Essence Emeralds. This cause's Permanant un-rezable EXP loss. Which in turn causes People to have to play longer to get to higher lvl's. ( I know that you guys want that! )<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have to say. *DON'T NERF THE LICH SERIES*. Some of us Necromancers NEVER REACH those high level raids! Don't punish the rest of us because a bunch of high level people's loot isn't phat enough or they're "bored" while fighting a _GOD_. It is something which I find essential in the lower levels. It's incredibly slow and painful to play without. To make it worse would make it more boring than having to be a "mana battery" at the final encounter could ever be! <P>Think of it this way. The final encounter last for maybe 10 minutes. There are 59 rather excruciatingly painful levels to get to that. Don't screw up the 59 levels before the Final Encounter for the rest of us, just because those who've already reached it don't care about how they got there. Make sense? I hope so.<P>- W</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have to agree with my fellow necromancers on the subject of our usefulness on large encounters.  Being a "mana battery" isn't what I consider fun (that is what we're supposed to play this game for is it not).<P>I mean, in an epic roleplay setting:<BR>Warrior: "I carved him like a goose for the cooking"<BR>Wizard: "ha! I did the cooking you feeble minded grunt!"<BR>Cleric: "He has you there warrior, I was glad Innorruk intereved and I got that complete heal off in time."<BR>Warrior: "Aye, cleric that was truly fine work.<BR>Necromancer: "Hey! I fed the cleric some mana!"<P>Oh wait, let's rework that last line.<BR>Necromancer: (holding the duck of death, which quacks just as he starts talking) *Quack* "Hey! I fed the cleric some mana!"<P>Oh boy. I feel like the master of undead now. Hangon, I think I'm gonna cry I'm so happy.<P>Bleh!<P>The Lich serices changes would hurt. I would accept them were I:<BR>1) Able to be able to land more of my DoTs on the large encounters, and have the corpse poof bug fixed once and for all (if you can't fix it then by god reimberse the mob's item contents when it does poof).<BR>2) My Pet would be a helpful addition to the party during encounters rather than a hindrance (i.e. as in a previous post why is this undead being affected by fear, disease, and poision?)<P><BR>Basically it boils down to two things.  Do you want us to be walking manastones? Then leave lich as it is.  Do You want to make us a viable party member during these raids? Reduce lich and let our stuff stick to the mob.<P>Thank you for your time,<BR>Kaashar Do'Van, 54th Level Necromancer<BR>Kanr Do'Van 55th Level Cleric<P>p.s.

</FONT><HR>Well, would like to see the essense emeralds become attainable through quest or maybe a quest that allows us to put charges on a single emmerald. <P>Also a look at our 55 spells. Seems only the pet buff is a usable spell. The night time only casting for our improved invis and levant spells, both lvl 55, also infusion which requires an essense emerald. That kills 3 lvl 55 spells right there.<P>None of the other classes have a time stipulation on thier invis spells. I understand the whole shadows are dark thing, but doesnt shadows appear only in the daytime or when their is light out?<P>Also the servent of bones spell needs to become a little more attainable. On my server(nameless) the spell sells for an average of 50k to 60k. I know I will never be able to afford this and actaully being able to loot the spell myself will be just as unrealistic. This is just too much. is this spell that expensive on other servers or did we just run up our own prices? I have heard that mages have the exact same problem with the CotH spell. I understand that money is in abbundance and needs to be reduced, but geez, I have never seen so much at one time.<P>I beleave that as an offensive class we are the best. We can solo what would take a full group to kill with minimal down time but post 50 our abilities are severy sacrificed in a group setting. I beleave that is a fair sacrifice, but it does get extremely boring soloing or camping stationary camps all the time. <P>Also a little out off the topic, but does it really make sense to have all lvl 51 pluss mobs able to summon? I can understand a caster mob doing it, or a wurm, but some mobs just have no bussiness with having the effect. It is very unrealistic. And ye, it may put the players a step up on the mobs, but summoning on all 51 pluss was the wrong way to handle it. Its pretty bad that the only way to kill a 51 pluss mob now is with 2 fearers or at least 2 full groups, composed of enough tanks to keep the summoning away from the casters. The feature is very unrealistic, and youd probly have far less complaining from all classes all the way arround if the ability was limited to certain types of mobs.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Thanks for revisiting Necros.  I have been playing my Necromancer since June 1999, and have become more and more estranged because of all the nerfs that we have taken over this time.  But, for some reason, I am giving you guys the benefit of the doubt that some day VI will wake up and fix this class and make it what it should be.  The fact that we were left out of the recent changes to Test didn't help, but I eagerly await the changes to be made based on these evaluations, as they will determine whether I continue to play EQ any more.  That's not a threat.  I am just voicing this general feeling I am getting from the entire Necro community.<P>With that said, here we go....<P>1.) Essence Emeralds - These need to be abolished completely.  People are simply not willing to Sacrifice 4-6 hours of hardcore levelling time to help us cast our spells.  Removing the use of Essence Emeralds doesn't really add that much to us anyway.  It just lets us actually use 3 spells that you all already gave us anyway.  If VI were balancing correctly, the decision of how im/balanced these spells are should have been made with the assumption that the necro in question has an unlimited supply of Essence Emralds anyway.  This gives you the "worst-case" scenario that VI seems to balance on in every other case.  It's the safest and best way to balance anyway.<P>2.) Infusion & Trucidation - Even without Essence Emeralds, there is just no feasible reason why these spells would ever be allowed to take up valuable Spell Gem slots. I MIGHT consider using them if they had a 3-5 minute recast time and did not require an Essence Emerald.<P>3.) Lifetaps and Tap DOTs - These MUST LAND on anything within the allotted 6 level range.  As stated before, the inablility to tap in uber encounters shuts down any and all secondary functions we have.  Mana transfers included.  Without this tap ability, we are truly a waste of space.  Even if they do not do damage, we still need the health back from the cast.<P>4.) Group DMF, Group DMF, Group DMF<P>5.) Ignite/Chill Bones - Please remove the skelly illusion in any way, shape, or form.  Even if they become proportionally sized skeletons, it is still very distracting and irritating to have to keep up with.  Also, 2 necros should be able to hit the same mob with Ignite/Chill at the same time.  There is no viable reason why we shouldn't be able to chain cast this with other necros.  They are significantly pathetic DDs for the levels we get them at.<P>6.) Lich series - Demi Lich and Arch Lich both at 60.  Arch Lich has a horrible conversion rate.  It is the same as the 49 Lich(31hp/20mana = 1.55ratio).  Solution:  Leave conversion rate on Demi Lich (48hp/31mana = 1.55 ratio) and move the spell to 55.  Leave Arch Lich at 60 and change conversion rate to (75hp/48mana = 1.55 ratio).  This keeps the same ratio which is obviously balanced, but raises the stakes.  The drastic hp loss of this spell would be too high to keep up for long, so it gives us a chance to take a great deal of power from the underworld to become a death machine (still only relying on taps, which are our only high lvl form of damge when grouped, assuming they land) for a little bit, but it cannot be sustained.  This is, of course, assuming that our taps and tap DOTs are fixed.<P>7.) Mana transfer rates - These need to be increased to a 2/1 or better from the current 3/1.  Perhaps we could get a mana fill dot of sorts, that allows us to channel to a target over time.  Either that, or the recast time needs to be increased.  They are not sufficient at the moment to really get a decent amount of mana to needed classes like Clerics and Chanters when it really matters.<P>8.) Life linking - This would work like the Diablo 2 Blood Golem.  We can cast this on a target and our hit points become pooled.  When either one takes damage, they are both hurt proportional to the percentage of the total hitpoints they contribute to the pool.  Likewise, when we tap, it replaces hitpoints in the same proportion.  ie.  I have 1000 hps.  A_warrior_01 has 3000 hitpoints.   A_warrior_01 is hit for 1000.  The total pooled hps are 4000.  The warrior contributes 75% of them so he takes 75% of the damage (750pts) and I take 25% (250pts).  I Deflux for 338.  Gives warrior 75% (254hps) and me 25% (84hps).  Any cleric heals distibuted the same way.  This spell should be able to be shut off manually.<P>9.) Mana linking - Similar to life linking, but creates a pool of mana shared between necro and target.  This spell should be able to be shut off manually.<P>This pretty much takes the already present channeling of life and mana we have, and expands on it to make us more appealing to a group.  Since we are can longer to deal damage due to the quick kill times in high levels, the delving into this channeling would be the only way to fix us.  We already have a beginning to this way of life.  But, I think enhancing it would really make us more group friendly, while at the same time employing skills from a subset we already have.<P>These Linking abilities would, of course, require some fine tuning, but I am trying to convey the principle and not the perfect way to implement it.<P>10.) Epic - ROFL.  It's simply NOT remotely epic.  Stats are ok.  Look is a repulsive joke.  Who wants to be laughed at when they wield their "epic" item?  Effect is worthless.  Free weaker version of Darkness that we will never use?  Free doesn't matter if we will never use it.  Maybe if it had an instant to 2s cast time.  Mages get an epic pet even though their pets get stronger post 50.  Our pets degrade past 49, and we are never compensated.  As stated many times before by others, Summon Bonechip would be a better effect.  OR, perhaps since VI is probably opposed to abolishing Essence Emeralds, how bout making it so when you wield the "epic", you do not need Essence Emeralds?  (The re-cast times of the EE spells still need to be fixed though.)<P>------------------------<P>Of course, some of this may seem drastic, but  Necromancers are drastically screwed up.  Also, with any ideas you all shoot down as being overpowering or imbalancing, please explain why.  We are very interested to hear how you thing, because none of it ever makes sense to us.<P>PLEASE FIX US!<P>Thanks very much.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I've played necro since march 21, 1999 when game first came out. Here's my opinions....<P>1) Lifetaps - If they do not work on uber mobs, maybe you can still let the heal component take effect? In example, a necro casts Vexing Mordinia on Velketor the Sorceror (he is immune to magic based stuff including lifetaps)... It cost 500 mana to cast. If it does not do damage but still heals us, that is 1000 heal for us for 500 mana. Not very efficient heal, but it IS a heal nonetheless, which lets true healer classes focus on the tanks, and not have to worry about the necro. Or, perhaps, give uber mobs a special flag that causes our lifetaps to have only 66% effectiveness on the uber/rare encounter boss mobs. Something though, to let us do something then just twitch.<P>2) Mana conversion spells... Most of the time, it is more useful to just bring another of the class that the necro is twitching mana to. Currently, our best twitch cost 400 mana to cast, and gives the target 150. Perhaps make it transfer more at a time with a better ratio? Make it cost like 800 mana to give 400. And make it so it has a low fizzle rate. 400 mana is much easier to play with or use then 150, especially with current casting delays, and the large mana cost will keep it from being able to be cast every 10 seconds.<P>3) Lich line of spells - Why change something that has been the same for 18 months of use? Suddenly, it is overbalancing though previously it was more then fine? Leave them alone. Only thing is, Arch Lich (spectre illusion one) at level 60 is only good as eye candy. It is WORSE then Demi Lich, our Kunark L60 variant, and the same level. Whats up with that? Perhaps make Arch Lich level 55?<P>4) Pets - the L53, 56 and 59 pets don't have enough hp. 53 pet is a rogue pet, does decent damage, but a mob turns once, hits, and the pet VERY hurt, if not complete toast. Monk pet too...<BR>Also, speaking about the monk pet, it needs its level raised. Level 56, when we first get the spell, its possible to get green (con) summons. Level 57, this is quite frequent, and level 58 it can take a whole stack of chips to get a blue pet (if you even bother trying). That is just.. wrong. Also, pet resists are way too low. On raids where there are AE effect spells, a pet will never ever EVER resist ANY of them. Gravity fluxes? Pah, will take a pet down to half in one blast (especially considering their low hp). Necro fire pets are resistant to fire. Water pets to poison. Couldn't tell ya on the air and earth ones, but they probably resist something. Perhaps do the same for necro pets? They ARE skeletons/undead summoned to unquestionably obey their owners. They are undead, and should act like it. They should be completely stupid and obedient. Make them attack only when the owner tells them to. If mobs wail on them, byby pet unless owner tells them to do something. And they need to be able to resist fears to be atleast able to do SOME damage (damage DOTs will still destroy them).<P>5) Essence Emeralds - Currently the only essence emeralds circulating through the game were made off people quitting the game (therefore sacrificing their characters from level 55+ to level 45 henceforth creating quite a few essence emeralds) or from twinks. Level 54-59 it can take 4-10+ hours to regain the experience lost from it, making it not a very viable thing to do. I don't suggest making them drop as loot, because that would make one hell of a campfight between parties and cause too many problems. Removing the min level limit would be bad too. Perhaps, make it so level 60s can be sacrificed (currently they can only if they die to a mob enough times to lose 60, then sacrifice a few times, and get the mob corpses resed back by the cleric, therefore regaining level 60)... What's the big deal anyways? Noone is ever EVER going to take a necro over a cleric for rezes. In raids, clerics have the res stick too (not to mention in groups). If not make level 60s sacrificable, maybe implement a quest in each necromancer town that allows necromancers to quest for essence emeralds? That would be a good idea too. Currently, essence emeralds are so rare that they will only be used for extreme emergencies. In example, a raid is wiped out. Necromancer survives through one of our many methods of death prevention (FD HS etc), and is left all alone. Instead of restarting over raid, having to summon and etc. it is VERY handy to just use up an essence emerald to bring in a cleric, and then let their ClickSticks do the work.<P>6) Infusion - The only way this spell is EVER going to be useful--targeted or not--is to make essence emeralds easier to attain.<P>7) Necro epic - The look is extremely comical. What annoys me more, is Kazan (the npc with the quest) chat text for it describes it as a scythe of shadows, black, etc... not as a bent stick with a duck-like skull on the top that opens and closes its mouth (QUACK QUACK). Ok, enough about the look. I could live with that. What annoys me is the stats and the effect.<BR>Necro epic totals: +40 to stats, +60 hp/mana, +50 to resists.<BR>Cleric epic totals: +50 to stats, +100 hp/mana, +50 resists<BR>Wizard epic totals: +50 to stats, +100 hp/mana, +40 resists<BR>Enchanter epic totals: +50 all stats, +80 hp/mana, +50 resists.<BR>And the list goes on... Why though, does the necro epic have 10 less to + stats and 20+ less hp/mana? Now, to talk about effects...<BR>Wizard: 800 damage absorption spell. Better then anything else they have for that type of spell.<BR>Rogue: haste. Best haste they can get.<BR>Cleric: L56 res. Saves them 600ish mana and lots of time.<BR>Magician: Uber pet. Best pet they can use.<BR>Monk: AWESOME gloves. best gloves they can get by far, and stackable haste effect too.<BR>Enchanter: Freecasting haste buff, and better then their spells. best they can use<BR>Necro: DOT snare that is almost identical to our L49 snare, except it takes longer to cast. Saves us 300 mana, which is nothing to us really (used to twitching away that much to give a cleric 100), and takes an impractical amount of time to cast.<BR>Again list goes on. Some other epics (like druid) have crappy effects too.<BR>Last but not least about the epics, is time it takes to get one. Look at the number of each type of class epics on a server. I will use my server (xegony) as an example.<BR># of rogue epics - Too many to count<BR># of cleric epics - LOTS...<BR># of warrior epics - 6-7<BR># of paladin epics - 4-5<BR># of SK epics - 3?<BR># of enchanter epics - Uh, a lot?<BR># of monk epics - tons<BR># of druid - 4 maybe 5<BR># of wizard epics - 2?<BR># of mage epics - 1<BR># of necro epics - 1<BR># of ranger epics - Lots<BR># of shaman epics - a whole bunch<P>Why are there so many of some and 1 necro... 1 mage... etc. As far as necros go... we need a *rare* drop from both gods. Gods respawn every WEEK and are highly sought after, and often killed hours only after servers go back up (and planes get populated of course). Then we need a rare drop from the boss on isle 4 of the plane of sky. Sky trips aren't exactly quick, cheap and easy going to set up repeatedly until you get the item ya need. Why does it take so long compared to say.. the monk quest which can be completed in 4-5 hours if the monk already hast their robe? or a cleric only which takes a week... Whats up? Gods should be made a 2-3 day spawn instead of 7 day, if not shorter then that. Their loot isn't very good anymore in comparison to kunark/velious stuff so no need to worry about uber item inflation... and it allows people to get their epic pieces who cannot make it into a fear/hate raid 5 minutes after servers go live.<P>Well, that's just my two cents.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hello, SK here...<P>One thing I've been suggesting for SKs which also effects necros greatly is removing the lifetap resistance that it seems every MOB of significance has.  Making lifetaps usable against ubermobs would give both necros and shadow knights a way to contribute.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What is up with other classes posting in this thread.  If you are a druid or a warrior or an enchanter or a whatever, there is a talk for you, I promise go look.  This isnt Wizards Talk about Necros, its Necro talk for necros.  So in other words unless you play a necro dont post in here, do it elsewhere.  <P>Absor I hope you take into account this when you read these posts.  These other classes have no experience with the Necro class and their posts should be disregarded.    </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055864-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055864.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055864-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055864-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055864-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055864-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055864&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055864&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
