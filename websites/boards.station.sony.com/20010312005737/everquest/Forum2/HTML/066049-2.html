</FONT><HR>What some of you guys don't seem to get is that the cleric nerf (i.e. bp nerfs, changes to healing aggro, etc.) affects not just clerics, but ALL tanks and especially warriors as well. Ever since Absor started the class balance/discussion threads, warriors have been saying that taunt is broken at the high end level. It just plain doesn't work, and especially on "uber" mobs, you just can't taunt them off of the casters, off of monks, off or rangers, off of shadowknights. Now, you add aggro to the cleric's best heal and all of a sudden taunt REALLY doesn't work, because in order to keep from getting that much aggro built up the cleric has to use a lesser heal or there's no way the warrior will taunt the mob off of the cleric. So the warrior gets healed less, and keeps the mob on him, but now he needs more heals, which sucks up mana faster and at some point the warrior is just begging for SOMEONE to get it off of him because he can't be healed fast enough. Against "uber" mobs, from ice giants to Naggie and Vox, to Icepaw Kobolds, plane mobs, and all the way up to crazy things like King Tormax or Velketor, tanks can't tank for 30 seconds. It can't be done without chain casting rune, or complete heals. <P>But the thing that these cleric changes really screws up isn't even healing. By making the cleric class more dangerous to play, they've made sure that "uber" raid-type encounters, like dragons and plane raids, Trakanon raids, Velk's Lab, etc. take more time, people, resources and deaths than before. No one goes on a planes raid, or a raid on Velk's lab, or a dragon raid without expecting to die at least once. For melee classes, this means dying and popping up at whatever god forsaken faraway bind point they are bound at. Now, since there are less clerics, how does the tank get back? Ressurection. The one ability that no other class gets in the game (unless you count the staff of forbidden rites or the paladin revive helm). Now since you expect to die at least once, and if a melee, you are bound far away, the only way back is by res or the mage call of heroes and the only way to regain the experience just lost is res. And to get back to the body quick enough to be able to roll on items you get, you have to have res. <P>Less resses means more time ressing, more items that decay because they can't get rolled in time, etc. And just boosting the healing powers of druids and shamans just doesn't do it. It doesn't make up for the lack of a cleric. <P>And then we get GEMS? And this is supposed to make playing a cleric or caster more fun? <P>Haemish MacLennan<BR>Clan Chieftan<BR>The Silver Daggers</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My thoughts on the subject.<P>First off, I'm a 57 cleric on 7th Hammer, did my first 52 or so levels on Test.<P>The original poster, while making interesting choices for his analogies, is essentially right.  A couple things I'd like to add:<P>very few people consider cleric a 'fun' class to play, and I can understand why.  It has it's good points - you can usually find a group, every guild wants you (if you're not a knob), in many ways the life of several dozen people can depend on you at high levels.  And I'm not even counting the ability to res.<P>The bad points?  you sit, stand, heal, sit.  You usually don't even get the satisfaction of doing damage, like a wizard making the same repetitive motions as yourself.  The pressure - "you're a loser because if you don't go on the raid none of us can go" - gee, thats nice, it's not a game now, it's work.<P>I know I don't speak for everyone, and I do enjoy playing my cleric, especially on big raids, but the few 'fun' bones that clerics have been thrown have been taken away.  Sure I can nuke, but my group will ostracize me for using my mana in such an 'unefficient' way.  The bp's gave me an opportunity to do something BESIDES heal, because of the mana it saved. The pet - something fun to use.  Mark of Karn - still very useful IMHO but only for removing damage shields.<P>Now, any of these changes have valid arguments as to why they should be changed, most of which I would have agreed with - IF the game had just come out.<P>And this brings me to my main point - you do NOT change the dynamics of a game in such a drastic way after it's been running full steam for what, 2 years now?  The game I enjoyed playing has been taken away, and I don't care why they did it, they did.  <P>Anyway...(casts resist flame)<P>Chrysalsix Peachfuzz<BR> 57 Templar<BR>Chrysalsi Saurus <BR> 32 Leezard Kiter<BR>Chrythalthith Thpittle<BR> 39 Plateless Tank</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"Wait 10 levels and see. Its alot different when the mobs have over 75,000 hitpoints and the agro builds and builds. Not saying you are wrong, simply saying it gets worse over time."<P>I can accept that argument.  I value it as true.  The high level clerics I talk to daily are complaining of that kind of issue.  Verant has said they will be 'fixing' the healing aggro for some high level encounters.  The last patch message seems to allude that they are attempting to fix this.<P>And I agree, my cleric is too low level to know of these problems first hand.<P>If I was a high level cleric living in this time, I would be pissed as h*ll.  Items that are too good to be true are taken away.  Logically, it makes perfect sense gameplay-wise.  But emotionally, it would HURT.  Regardless of what some may think, a lot of people have real emotional attachment to their avatar.  The amount of bitter arguments only reflects this.  I would also be pissed that the way I helped people has been upset to the point of seemingly no way to win.<P>I guess in the end, I am saying that I can empathize with high level clerics.  As of right now, I do not logically agree with some of them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Verant probably did think that clerics were too powerful because of resurrection, but isn't that why the spell was given to paladins and necromancers?  <P>Besides, Verant designed the cleric class, or someone at Verant did.  Is the heavy nerfing of the cleric class an indication of some sort of political power shift at Verant?  Is there a new head of the design team, and was that person snubbed by a cleric for a rez?  Yeah, I know, they don't base decisions upon shallow things like that.<P>The unfortunate thing about all the cleric nerfs is the lack of adequate communication from Verant about the motivation for the nerfs (that's not the same as giving the reasons why).  They sort of announce them and run, and wait for all the howling to subside.  There is a little explanation when the nerf appears about how they feel that the breastplates are unbalancing, or that healing aggro has been broken for the past two years(!), but it rings hollow, since the game is now thrown heavily out of balance by leaving the high end mobs untouched. And even the reasoned protests go unaddressed.<P>However, I understand that this is a long-term, difficult, fantasy MMORPG that was designed with the powergamer with lots of free time in mind.  It probably isn't the game I would have preferred to spend two years playing, if alternative MMORPG games existed, because I'm more of a casual player.  <P>The very difficulty of the game, the amount of time it takes to gain a level, and the lack of loot on the monsters pre-50, are all indicators of the hardcore D&D GM mindset of the designers, and are strong indicators of the client base they originally set out to capture.  Again, if there had been an alternative game out there worth playing, I probably would have gone that way instead of to EQ. <P>Fortunately, viable alternatives to the fantasy MMORPG will be available soon.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A Cleric's Dodge caps at 75.<P>My issue is with the huge "jumps" that Everquest has.<P>The important one here is: Aggro for healing a Level 51+ character as opposed to healing a Level 50- character.<BR>The aggro increase is NOT based on the level of the mob, it's based on the level of the person being healed.<BR>Would you like proof?  Then try this experiment.<P>Take a Level 50 Monk, a Level 51 Monk and a Level 29 Cleric (Heck, a Level 19 Cleric) to the Oasis.<BR>Find a Sand Giant and have the Level 51 Monk start soloing it.  When the SG is down to about 20% health, have the Cleric cast a single healing spell on the Monk.<BR>The Sand Giant will go after that Cleric like there's no tomorrow.<BR>Now fine another Sand Giant and have the Level 50 Monk start soloing it.  When the SG is down to about 20% health, have the Cleric cast a single healing spell on the Monk.<BR>The Sand Giant MIGHT take a swing at the Cleric, if he's in range... but will probably just keep fighting the Monk.<P>The other one is Hell levels... "It's a problem with the formula used to calculate..." blah, blah, blah...  Use a different formula.  It can't possibly be THAT difficult.<BR>In another thread, Absor admitted that the aggrivation of a Hell level could be spread over two consecutive levels... giving two "Heck" levels in place of one "Hell" level.<BR>I'd go for that.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It is very simple to understand what verant is doing with clerics. They represent the means to finishing the game and moving on to somethng else hence a lost customer and lost revenue, what they don't understand, and I have tried to tell them is that if they have a great game people will play it and once a character is maxed they will start new characters. Also I believe they are afraid that clerics with there power to heal and melle and cast will dominate the players choice for characters to play and none of the other classes will get any attention if they were made the way clerics classic D&D games were designed. So they nerf them, and ignore the players who play them and thier complaints for the most part.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just my two cents not sure if anyone else mentioned it here. I think this is basicly an attempt to:<P>Get clerics to quit or have less of in Norrath. this intern stops an abundance of healers. Which then makes groups less effective which intern slows down lvling and other things. Also it gives a less likley chance to get exp rez with less clerics again slowing you down in exp etc. Thus they must think it will prolong the life of you the paying customer to keep paying. If they can keep you playing longer you will be paying more monthly rates. The main reason people quit EQ is bordom they reach 50 or 60 or some fairly high lvl and stop playing thus stop paying. If they can keep the player base interested for a few more months that equals more $$$$. I dont know I think this all comes down to dollars. Maybe I am just jaded on big corps. But with new games on the brink of realease they gotta milk us for all they can before we all pick up and go due to new games.<P>just my 2 cents</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Kytarna,<P>How would you know? If you did, in fact, know me then the cleric quest armor legs (and absolute lack of ANY planar armor or planar items in general) at level 51 might clue you in to the fact that I have played Camare since approximately eight months after release (started out as a wizard from release). Oh, wait, you're level 29... you probably don't have that stuff yet to know what it even looks like. My bad.<P>Camare has grouped with friends and aquaintances throughout her very long and reputable career (she started on Solusek Ro and moved to Druzzil during the split). She has died many times, saved many people, had magnificent adventures, and helped kill lots of bad guys. She is not twinked or power-leveled in any way. Everything she owns was either taken off a corpse that her group killed or bought or traded for with funds/items from those same adventures. I would also like to say that a power-leveled cleric is incapable of performing the strategic, surgical healing necessary to the post-50 game (which was pretty much wrecked by the heal/hate patch). At least, not to the degree that I can, I assure you.<P>For you to throw unbackable, callous, resentful, (and not to mention false) accusations at someone because they called you out for taking a position on a topic you could not possibly (by your own admition) know anything about, you have completely invalidated anything intelligent you might have to say in the future on that topic or, pretty much, otherwise.<P>See how credibility works in the big-people world, honey?<P>Cam</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Nenja has put his finger right on another major problem with the game, especially as it deals with the post 50 uber-encounters.  At this point in time however, Verant is a sinking ship.   They simply are unable to see this fact past their own “Vision.”  They continue to make bad decisions, and ostracize their customers, firmly believing what they are doing is best for the game.  <P>My question: How can something that hurts the customers so badly that many have decided to simply quit possibly be good for the game?  <P>Apparently, this being the case, Verant truly thinks that anyone that dares to tackle these uber-encounters is bad for the game, because they certainly are trying to get rid of them; and, as Nenja pointed out they’re doing it with surgical precision.  The high level game revolves around clerics.  Without clerics there are no raids.  So, best way to remove these people who try to kill uber SoV mobs:  Nerf clerics into oblivion.  When all the clerics have quit, everyone else will be forced to since the high level game becomes unplayable.   Since this isn’t enough however, they’ve already made most classes useless in these uber-encounters.  I suppose its their way of preparing people to move on, to break the addiction.<P>I have no faith in Verant anymore.  Their “Vision” is far from 20/20.  They have proven to me they do not know what’s best for the game over and over, and furthermore they are intent on completely and utterly destroying it for the upper level players.   The saddest part of all—they truly believe what they are doing is best, and they adamantly refuse to trust their customers who tell them otherwise.   They fix the problems they caused through their own poor implementation by nerfing the players, as opposed to fixing their design.  Bad business to say the least.  Verant truly is the enemy now.  <P>Tazeal Twicebourne<BR>&lt;The Harmonium&gt;<BR>Xev Server<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bravo Bevan-<BR>They are trying to water down the cleric that is all there is to it. We who play clerics feel more then a little betrayed. The people who are just now starting can't relate and shouldn't post on this type of thread. I started EQ as a pally and was sort of voluntered to play a cleric by my circle of friends. I have grown to love my cleric. I have gotten used to sitting medding, standing healing, and the buffing (rarely with any compensation for the 10 plat expense of each symbol). The dropping of what I was doing to do a res or three for strangers with just a thanks as payment (which is more then enough payment for me btw). Now I see my spells going to other classes and my own class not getting any of thier goodies in return (self port, invis, self mana regen,). Now they kill me for doing my JOB ! ! ! To say that before the patch there was no heal agro is a joke, A couple weeks ago I was on a Vox raid our group was the A group I cast 1 that's right 1 CH was summoned and killed so fast it was sad. This was way before they made the 1st. heal/hate change. Now even with the fix I am getting the crap knocked outta me even in Karnor's, by the mobs there, on my first cast. It sucks, plain and simple. Verant wasn't fixing something that was broken. They just tried to justify something they (for god knows what the real reason was) changed.<BR>I find myself playing alts more now, I wonder why?<P>Lannear Faithborn<BR>Vicar, Mistwalkers Alliance<BR>Terrew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>BUMP VI read this please and respond with something more then what you have done all ready.<P>For many of you who do not know there is a web site besides EQs that has been watching what Verant has been doing to the cleric class called Lum the mad http://lum.xrgaming.net/<P>[Filed by Lum the Mad]<BR>2001-03-04 17:20:00 <BR>"Everquest doing a Rodney King on clerics with the Nerf Baton"<P>2001-03-05 01:50:00 [Filed by Lum the Mad]<BR>"GRANT ME, YOUR DUTIFUL CLERIC, FAITH, MY LORD, WISDOM AND DEVOTION. OH, AND ALSO, MAKE VERANT'S DESIGNERS BURN IN THE FIERY PITS OF THE NINTH HELL. AMEN."<P>Reading the boards lately, one gets the impression someone at Verant just doesn't like clerics very much any more. First the revision to "mob hatred" (what drives how the monster AI in EQ decides who to splat into a thin red paste) which depending on how you looked at it, fixed a year long bug or reduced the average life expectancy of your group's cleric to ten seconds (that being how long it takes for Complete Heal to fire off). Then, Donal's Chestplate of Mourning was "nerfed" (it cast Complete Heal on demand, which healed people, which, you know, would be bad. And stuff.) by a special "buff effect" which ensured you could only use it on a given person every five minutes. And finally, recently, the high level cleric armor dropping on Plane of Growth which cast Celestial Elixir (another heal spell) was... well, you know the drill.<P>The Verant Spin Patrol was out on the Whineplay hustings, trying to make sense of the delirium, with Abashi playing bad cop and Absor playing, um, other bad cop. First, from Abashi, comes this explanation: <P>(Abashi)Yeah, we've pretty much agreed all the way around that high HP heal items are a bad idea. These items were in fact created by a guy who plays a high-50s cleric in an "uberguild" and even he didn't realise the impact. <P>In any case, while I personally agree that 1 minute more or less makes the effect useless, these items are such that there's not really a middle ground. Usually somewhere between "Overpowered" and "Useless" there's "Balanced". I don't think there is in this case given our current limitations. <P>And later, we get the follow-through from Absor: <P>(Absor)I just wanted to stress here that we are not trying upset people, though we knew people would be upset by this change. We change things like this because we think they need to be changed. <P>Some folks are suggesting (perhaps because I mention that we do some things for the betterment of the game), that we are more concerned with the health of the game than the happiness of our cutomers. <P>I want to point out it that your opinion of what we plan to do is always a consideration, often it is THE consideration. But sometimes the health of the game is more important. In the long run, our customers will be happier with a good game. We need to find and correct our mistakes when they can harm the game. <P>Changing these items is not all that different than any of the 'positive' changes we've made to the game, with the exception of the way those changes have been perceived. All are done with thought about the health of the game in mind. <P>(Lum)You know, he's right. Negative changes are just like positive changes. Except for, you know, the negative parts. <P>As you can imagine, the reaction from the players has been fairly feral. As someone put it on a cleric board, on Whineplay "it's an all-out flamewar between clerics and druids/shammies, hoping someone at Verant will notice." Someone sent this via email to our good offices: <P>Tigole of Legacy of Steel fame has quit EQ. Add him to the list of high profile players quitting over clerical changes. Furor of FoH fame is making Tuesday his make it/break it patch. Afterlife has lost several members. The entire thing is coming down, baby! <P>Is the whole thing REALLY coming down? Probably not. People have been crying foul at Verant "readjustments" since the first change to Whirl Til You Hurl made enchanters hurl. Rogues have gone from joke characters with skills that were never actually used to frenzied gods of melee uberdamage. Necros get nerfed, and nerfed, and nerfed again, and - wait for it - nerfed yet again, yet still are seen as somewhat "broken" since they have an annoying tendency to not crumple up and die. Yet still people manage to log in and play the game and eke out their miserly alloted portion of fun. <P>Don't worry, though. Verant does actually understand the pain you are going through. They understand that downtime is really horrible in Everquest and it's something that people resent and well, they're giving something BACK.<BR>That's right. TETRIS, now live. As Nicademus noted in #lummies IRC, "We know our game is boring as crap, so here's another game to play while waiting for ours to be fun." <P>I can't really say anything else about Medtris without breaking out into a fit of violent giggling, so instead I'll point you to Aradune's recent comment on the coming-to-a-server-near-you newbie dungeon, the Warrens. <P>(Aradune)You know, considering what I have heard coming from test (ie, high levels camping all the spawns in the warrens), I think Verant should seriously consider level capping the Warrens for the first few weeks it is out. <P>Maybe start out the first day with a level cap of 8 or so, and then increase it every day for two weeks. <P>The Warrens will not go live this week, but probably on the next patch. <P>And we have noted the bottom feeding, and may well do someting about it with this zone (before it goes live) and newer ones. <P>Given Verant's history, why do I have the feeling it involves violent, repeated, painful death?<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bumping in support. <P>Verant designed the high level (post Kunark) game dependant upon the clerics ability to heal. If they nerf clerics into oblivion, this affects ALL players. Donals BP, okay I can maybe understand this. The PoG BP nerf I don't think is right. The healing aggro changes are ridiculous. As a druid, casting chloroblast 2 times, I get summoned and beaten to death by Trakanon, with 20 or so tanks beating on him...I find this unbelieveable. I have watched clerics die repeatedly after casting CH in normal exp groups. Guess who dies right after trying to heal the cleric? Yup, me the little druid.

</FONT><HR>"The original healing/aggro change went overboard; that I agree with, and we'll just have to see how the latest patch has changed it (haven't read any horror stories, since)."<P>this may be due to so many of the 50+ clerical crowd having already left.<P>I've tested the changes from Tuesdays patch.  There's not much difference with respect to CHeal, it still means death.  Remedy, Celestial, etc seem a little better in that i didn't have to use both of my devines before the mobs could get taunted off of me.  <P>Mezed mobs still make a b-line to whoop my soon to be Devined butt, but this is most noticable, they get taunted off quite easily now.  A heal on a multi-pull without mez though still equals cleric death though.  <P>Last night the strategy on a multi pull was to just let em die, and then rev em back.  The tanks actually preferred this over my healing, my dieing, followed by them dieing, followed by 4-8hrs of CR.  CR is knocked down to the couple min they need to loot their bodies, let rev effects wear off, get re-buffed an back into the game.  I gotta tell ya, you don't understand how WRONG it feels to let a tank die instead of healing them.<P>Again, my account is canceled.  I'm waiting til expiration to see if they fix it, or do anything to even remotely make the game playable for my 60 cleric.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I work for a company wich caters 100% to customer service for hi profile business travelers..one thing that verant must learn is that for every unhappy customer there are 10 more alike...you hear from the unhappyones that are soo mad that they spend their precious time ranting the issue the other 10 are so upset that they will not even bother with ranting..they will simply never do business with that company again. Verant you are falling into this pitfall...If I would treat my customers as you do I would soon be out of a job. This game was indeed a fenomena created by word of mouth people said my god this game is awsome you have to try it..so I did and I loved it, now I am not sure if I do anymore, I still play it because the last two years I have invested a lot of time in it and have formed a close relationship with many players and wish that when the next ungodly good game comes out that we may go our ways together to this new game. I wish you well Verant you where once good. I shall play untill the next good thing comes out.<P><BR>Yaladan Windsong<BR>Tunare's Soldier<BR>57 Evoker (Mithaniel Marr birth Drinal retirement)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sorry -Baeven but you really ought to look at the big picture.  Verant is basically admitting they made a mistake when they implemented these (mostly rare) armors.<P>I support the armor change and agree that the items were unbalanced.  The heal aggro change was correct, in the sense that creatures should have some awareness of how much is being healed.  Their reaction to that may be too strong and need adjustment but Verant has shown that they are open to making that change.  So I'm not worried there.<P>As for the breastplates / raids: it is not your RIGHT to get whatever loot you want in the game.  If Verant makes an area completely impossible because of this so-called nerf, then players simply won't go there.  After awhile of no zone use, Verant may decide it is too hard and adjust it.<P>The rest of your argument is a really good example of a modified Red Herring:<P>http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/red-herring.html<P>Drop the Holocaust references and stick to facts and you'll be more credible.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I've been playing for 2 years as a cleric.  I've liked it, because I was usually the only thing that kept a group alive...  Specially as I gained more levels and fought harder mobs.  I have, since I got the spell, used CH on my tanks.  I used it in the planes, when they came out, and everyone said to use something else because it took too long to cast, and NOONE could time it right (yes, this was quite a while ago, when the tanks were still using Rubicite as their main equipment).  I even caught myself using it on a monk, because they were the puller, and hell, they had well over 900 HP missing (this was a number I figured out was acceptable and more mana-efficient to cast CH on someone rather than Superior Heal).<BR>So why are clerics bitter?  Because they die, faster and harder than any other class.  <BR>Why are they dying?  Because they cannot defend themselves, and are being ostricised for doing what everyone expects them to do:  keep everyone else alive.<P>VI has changed a fundamental and integral part of the way that I play my class, and how I manage to keep my groups alive, time and time again.  Can you imagine the uproar that would be caused if they made mobs *super* agro on a caster when they landed full damage?  Or hows about *fixating* on ONE tank or melee untill one or the other died, after that melee had done x amount of damage?<BR>Never did I EVER hear anyone say "Well, you know, I like having a cleric in my group, but with that complete heal, it just makes the class WAY too overpowered."  or "Gee, this mob with 300,000 HP's is REALLY easy to kill!  All I have to do is pray that it only hits me 4 or 5 times, and then ignores me for 10 seconds while I get CH cast one me!  Boy oh boy!"<BR>The "nerf" of healing is a change to the fundamental gameplay.  It does not make the game more playable, but less.  If I wanted to learn a new style of playing, I would choose another class (which I have, by the way, which is also why Baven can usually not find me online when his guild is killing some uber mob or another).  It was done without the input from the players, specially the clerics, and probably only to make it harder for anyone to accomplish anything of great value, so as to keep them playing in hopes that someone could actually defeat mob x and claim prize y.<P>What I have to do now in order to keep my group alive, is cast Celestial Elixur on people at the FIRST sign they get hit.  Once I am able to cast again, they are down about a bubble or 2 of health, I cast Divine Light, and they should be at about 4 full bubbles of health, with a pulse of CE still pending...  Now, this is what, 1800 HP?  I dont know exactly, but it's not loads.  I look at my mana, and I have 3 3/4 mana left....  Not lots when you consider that I have only started the fight, and only for one tank's health.  Meanwhile, the enchanter's been trying to mez a mob or 2, is down to half health, and can't cast because they are usually more worried that I'm not going to be done giving baby-heals to the tanks in order to heal them.<BR>With one CH, I would have been able to wait a MUCH longer time, healed WAY more health, had a little more than 4 bubbles of mana, and maybe have enough time to heal the enchanter while I'm at it!  I still can do this, but I'll have to tank until someone can get the mob off me, and that dosen't happen unless it's some low blue mob that *can* be taunted.  I will cast DA, which makes a mob seem to instantly forget about you, and go eat tank.  Of course, I now can't heal the tank, because I'm invulnerable (if I click it off, I'm in the same position as before WITHOUT a means to live through the attack), and am forced to watch my group members die one by one, while I sit back and figure out what lv57+ necro is on at the moment to summon out corpses.<P>What response would we, the playing community, like?  Answer these questions:<BR>Why did you make a change to something that has not bothered anyone for two years?<BR>Why is it that the cleric, so humble, and comfortable with their niche in the game, that you must make bear your most terrible wrath?<BR>Why is it that when a druid gets nerfed (be it only so that it's made harder for them to solo mobs that are much more powerful than they are), you give an outpouring of sympathy and apologies, yet you annihilate the cleric, and we don't even dignify a response?<P>We are waiting, and watching.<P>Velglarn Ya'Ler<BR>Templar, Xev<P>PS  My opinion about the nerfing of items is pretty much the same.  Leave items as-is when they go live.  If you haven't figured out that they're too overpowering while on test, you're idiots who obviously don't offer enough incentives to people to PLAY on the test server.  Some things, like the Treant Fist from WAY WAY back when, should obviously be changed, becuase they rendered someone basically invulnerable and able to kill anything, barring going LD.<P>PPS  I don;t know if what I said makes any sense, because I'm quite tired.  So, if you would be so kind, excuse my spelling mistakes and just remember this:  I'm a cleric, I'm upset about the changes made recently to my class, and I want what has been done to be "un-done".  Maybe people will take more notice of how this is affecting us if we just refuse to heal for the first 30 seconds of any fight....  /ponder</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
