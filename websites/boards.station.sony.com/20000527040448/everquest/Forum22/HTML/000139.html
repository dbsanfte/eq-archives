</FONT><HR>I play a 50th Level wizard along with some other characters on Povar. I'm not a roleplayer...that is to say i don't generally engage in rp speech or really have a set "storyline" Reading some of the posts here for this server though...and from my own experience, I have to agree...We have to be the worst server in terms of friendliness and tolerance and i might add basic human decency. I don't know if this is because we have more children that play on our server or just really silly adults. It gets tiring to see some newbie ask a question in shout in any zone and get flamed for absolutely no real reason. Or try to auction something...or ask for a camp check...flame flame flame... I really after 100 or so combined levels on this server wish i could take my chars and join a more friendly server. And to those of you out there that flame ppl for asking questions... be original at least with your flames... if i hear one more person in lguk claim "i'm camping everything" i'm gonna vomit. Or the standard (whiny voice) "There's 80 ppl in the zone EVERYTHING is camped" jeez every night like clockwork. Heh guess i'm flaming the "flamers" The gm event in steamfont was so frustrating... it showed how low this server has sunk. These mental giants were flaming the gm's lol...who were trying to do something to benefit our pathetic server. And some of the posts on big guilds and planes runs were absolutely correct Povar is for the Big Powerful mean spirited Item farming guilds... not for the roleplayer unfortunately. Well that's my 2 cps worth. <P>Hope I see some of you around i know there are good ppl on povar but i'm doubting its the majority anymore... i used to be an optimist.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I've gota agree with you David04, i AM fairly new, but the number of absolutly obnixous people i've met on this server amazes me.. now i've finally met some people that may not be the best roleplayers but they are friendly and still enjoy grouping. Even in this group I had a problem with one player, but he's new and seems to be changing his attitude.

</FONT><HR>I'd have to agree with ya in general. It sux that the big five guilds control the planes and big raids, I was in Sol b and i actually heard someone form NA do /ooc that they would take three LUCKY ppl to help with the FG raid. One had to be a cleric. They acted like they were doing us a favor. I also had a bad experience in Cazic for about 6 lvls, it got really frusterating. But i'm sure that it's like this on almost every server. And you gotta take the nice ppl that you meet (there are some left) and group with them and talk with them  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">. <P>Overseer<BR>Lvl 48 mage-Povar<BR>Soldier of T'or Drakkon</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>My friends and I chose this server as it had the lowest amount of players when we first signed on (it was the newest server). However, after a few weeks of playing, we too noticed a general lack of manners and decency from many characters we encountered. From outright verbal harassment to kill-stealing and exploitation...<P>Since we were old UO players, we figured it was normal. But when we began to hear stories of other servers and about some of the great guilds and awesome events taking place, we began to feel like we picked the wrong server.<P>I quit EQ for a few months, primarily because the camping and harassment issues that Verant was having a hard time dealing with. Once RoK hits the stores, I will elect to create a new account and start on a server that seems to have the best organization and team work. <P>Granted, all servers have their bad seeds, but with careful review, you can determine which servers fit you style of play...just look at how many events are held on the Tarew Mar or Veeshan servers. It occured to me that the oldest servers (those that came on-line first) contain the more mature players. This is just my observation however...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I have table-top role played for over ten years. I’ve Live-Action role-played for just about as long, long before there were finalized “rules” available for purchase. I’ve mudded and pbm’d as well. This doesn’t mean much in the grand scheme of EQ though, since it’s my observation that EverQuest is actually an ADVENTURE GAME set in a fantasy setting. Aye, true, the ability to role-play is there for the taking, and I do believe more of Norrath’s citizenry should take advantage of it. But I do not believe the issue is about role-playing verses… whatever else there is to oppose it (powergaming perhaps?).<P>I do believe that it is about community, and about consequence. In today’s society, consequences exist for those who would take actions against the “societal norm.” While it is an unfortunate truth that many of society’s most brilliant and innovative are somewhat ostracized by the rest of the crowd, that minority suffers because of an age-old ingrained survival mechanism: Different will often get you killed. Blend in, be part of the herd, don’t rock the boat, and you will be able to continue quietly with your day-to-day life. Here is how it relates to the rudeness so prevalent in EQ, and on other server-based games; and here’s how it relates to role-playing versus power-gaming in general.<P>By nature, most role-players are a flamboyant lot, a group that is inherently “different” in that they stand out. Combine this with a group of persons who are exploitive of a system that has little in the way of consequences, and you get a pretty nasty standoff. What happens is this: in general society, poor behavior and antisocial activities are punished. Online, role-playing types are free to role-play without the fetters of a physical body that can't actually cast magic, or shoot a bow, or a thousand other things. They free themselves up. However,online, where the consequences for such actions are greatly lessened (hence the role-players can be "different"), you also see more rudeness and general self-centered behavior emerge. Why bother playing nice, when there is no “punishment” for getting ahead any which way you can? After all, by setting up a “game” situation where the object IS to “win,” getting ahead by any means necessary is almost par for the course. Add to this the “anonymity” of the internet where the careful rules of society do not apply (the internet has it’s own rules, based more on general consensus of the vocal minority) and what happens is more rudeness by more people who can basically get away with it because there is no way to “punish” them. Toss in role players, who inherently play by very structured rules, speech, and mannerisms, and you end up with a pretty rough situation all around. One group sees the EverQuest as an elaborately beautiful set in which maintaining a persona can be easily attained via the computer avatar—and the other group sees it as a place where consequences for actions are on a completely different strata. (There is a median group, a group that I call “casual gamers,” but typically no one honestly has a severe problem with them.)<P>What needs to happen then, is that the silent majority needs to join the vocal minority. If you are a person who enjoys role-playing or powergaming, then by all means, do so—and get others to do it with you. If you feel that politeness and propriety are important to you, then maintain that level of behavior for yourself to encourage it in others. Don’t just up and leave because you meet the vocal and rude (or just plain different) majority. <P>The other thing that needs to happen is a system of actions and consequences needs to form, via the PLAYERS. No matter how many “play nice policies” Verant tosses out, such things are nearly useless until the majority of PLAYERS make antisocial and exploitive actions “punishable” by a set of consequences. <P>Aye, this is just one person’s opinion and a few random observations. Rather than curse one another out, or toss up my hands and leave at the antics of the role-players or the tactics of the powergamers, I intend to stick it out. I believe that by maintaining a presence on Povar server people who want to make a change can actually do so. The trick of course, is knowing what you want and persistently trying to achieve it.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
