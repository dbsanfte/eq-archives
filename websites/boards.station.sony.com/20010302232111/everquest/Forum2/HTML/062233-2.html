</FONT><HR>The point is these posted rules are meaningless since they are not applied universally.<BR> <BR>"GrollerDabard slept with my hamster"<BR> <BR>"Reply here so I can get two hundred replies"<BR> <BR>"My monkey drives a BMW"<BR> <BR>while all may be cute, or funny, are all in violation of posted policies. I really don't care about these threads and have nothing against grollerdabard or any of the other resident vak's but my one issue here is that Verant is not enforcing their rules with an even hand. If they want to make these rules they should make EVERYBODY go by them and not just let SOME people slide while others have their threads locked.<P>There were some threads which were locked that dealt with -legitimate- issues of class balance. I feel these threads should not have been locked. When they are locked and done so under the guise of "breaking board policy" and then people go and see a dozen other threads that *really* violate the board rules but were NOT locked - this pisses people off.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I don't know why GrollerDaBard is allowed to be outside the board rules, but thats how Verant works.<P>Part two (part 6) has NOTHING to do with EQ, and should have been locked, like the Iraq thread I posted to a few weeks ago.<P>These rules are a bunch of crap, and will only be enforced if your name isnt GrollerDaBard.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>For the general discussion forum :"This forum is for general discussion related to EverQuest."<P>For the rules :"In general, you may post any material, written in a courteous and mature manner, providing that it is on-topic for the forum to which you are posting. This includes material that disagrees with the way that we, the developers, operate the game. We will not interfere with the communication of thoughts and ideas as long as the presentation is appropriate for all those capable of reading the forum."<P><BR>The topic of Part Two (Part Six) is that there are some of us who feel that there is a need for a touch bit more levity and nonsense both here and in the game..that some of the players and some who run the game are taking this all a tad too serious. Now given that, I will be the first to admit that the topic for Part Two (Part Six) is paper thin, but we're still sticking to it and following all the rules that are layed out for us.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Hope not to have any problems with you."&lt;<P>If you didn't have a problem with Akriss, then you won't have problems with Auric.  But it is our job here to play Big Brother when we have to.<P>Cabriolet wrote:<P>&gt;"So I have a question.<P>Are threads like, "Part 2 (part 6)" which contains hundreds upon hundreds of nonsensical and offtopic posts allowed? According to your own rules that thread should be locked, but it was not.<P>And according to your own rules some legitimate issues on class balance threads WERE locked which should have not. It may be subjective but the thread on "part 2 (part 6)" is a pretty clear cut case of not following the forum rules.<P>It seems that you guys are not enforcing your own rules with an even hand."&lt;<P>Actually, the thread you mentioned doesn't break any rules.  Off topic isn't evil.  We don't mind seeing fun threads.  As for any other threads being closed, they were closed for a reason.  Specify a thread and I'll tell you why it was closed.<P>Breathe-Rathe wrote:<P>&gt;"I, for one, am real tired of seeing people call each other morons because they have a difference of opinion."&lt;<P>These are also my major concern.  I don't want one customer attacking another, it's bad for all of us.<P>Tramaus Voronadil wrote:<P>&gt;"So general discussion is only about EQ related things, or can it include such nice posts as the "Voyager" thread going on now?"&lt;<P>There are no specific rules against off-topic threads.  We will, however, be much more active in closing off topic threads that start to go nasty.  And we don't want a large number of off topic posts, that would sort of de-rail the whole idea of talking about EverQuest here.  But we like to see fun posts just like you do, on topic or not.<P>Originalkli wrote:<P>&gt;"Sure I agree but most people posting here already know the rules...what he did is akin to your father telling you "Dont make me pull over"&lt;<P>Not a bad analogy.  Let's see if it works.  I hope it does.<P>Brewhaus wrote:<P>&gt;"Um, not trying to sound disrespectful guys, but where in those rules does it say "bumping" is not aloud? The rules aren't that hard to understand in my opinion. It says if you bump multiple threads about the same topic to monopolize the front page, not just if you bump."&lt;<P>Right here:<P>&#61623; Monopolize the front page of any forum by "bumping" threads of the same or similar content to the front. We may intervene by closing threads any time that this occurs. <P>Sperno wrote:<P>&gt;"something psychological about that.<BR>for the longest time i thought akriss was a woman, until the lumthemad visit. then i was, what the hell? akriss is a guy? kinda funny the pictures you mentally create of people seeing only their words. aristotle was probably a midget "&lt;<P>I'll let Akriss know that he writes like a girl.<P>Brewhaus wrote:<P>&gt;"None of these fall under this rule because they are all off-topic. There is no rule goeverning these topics and therefor it is a judgement of the moderator. The rule says ANY ON TOPIC thread is allowed, it doesn't say whether off topic threads are allowed or not."&lt;<P>That's a very good summary.<P>nazgaroth wrote:<P>&gt;"helz, me neither, i think i'll refrain from posting here any more. it's gotten to be waste of time anyway, gettin' sucked in to pointless arguments with juveniles."&lt;<P>Again, this is the sort of thing that we don't want.  If your 'discussion' is going to end with name calling, then don't start it.  And don't point at the other person and say 'he started it', because that doesn't matter.  Each of us is responsible for our own actions.<P>Yes, calling someone juvenile is a flame, just in case you were about to argue that with me…   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Oh, caught up on my reading... I get it now, Cabriolet had all of his hate-threads closed.<P>But our non-confrontational, friendly thread didn't get closed.  This must really bother you.<P>Is it EQ related? Yes, it's related to people needing to relax a bit.<P>This is a game, no change to the game should make people pour out HATE to the developers/designers/players the way I've seen it done here.<P>These are people, just like you that have good points and bad points.  The Part Two thread is here to remind people to try to focus on the good points, make fun of those that get over-excited about the bad-parts, and of course, to try to get the Fluffy Pillow Quest fixed.<P>Absor and Abashi have jobs to do, and they have restrictions set on them by the company, as well as the fact that they don't make the final decisions.<P>They are Liasons, plain and simple.  It is very possible for the designers to just ignore them, though they don't appear to.  You look at these boards as if this is the primary outlet.  It is not, and it is NOT representitive of the players.  People that are happy with the game, with the few exceptions (mostly all the ones that post on the Part Two thread), are pissed off at the game in one way or another and use this forum to vent that anger.  Which is fine, as long as you vent it to the side, and not AT someone.<P>-- Fabmatil</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I've seen various "off-topic non evil" threads closed because they were "off-topic" while others were left standing. Why are some "off-topic" threads locked while others allowed to remain? <BR> <BR>I always assumed off-topic threads were not allowed so didn't even think to question the closing of off-topic threads. It's seems to me that if they allowed off-topic posts then people could spam these boards with all kinds of non-related EQ nonsense - and this would make it difficult for players with legitimate questions to be able to read the message boards because they'd have to sift through a thousand, "GrollerDabard had my love child" threads.<P>But now that they've stated off-topic threads are OK I am puzzled...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

In those instances, I was always one of the first people to point out that ANY subject needs to be kept to five seperate threads or less.<P>Off-topic posts have no more right to spam the front page than regular posts do. It's the same whether you have ten posts about cleric healing, or ten posts about how your foot hurts today. <P>It's the MODERATORS DISCRETION as to what gets deleted, and what doesn't. That's what he's there for. Trust his judgement. Akriss was always pretty good at keeping things light-hearted but still pretty on-topic. I don't doubt that Auric may have a different outlook on what should be locked, and what shouldn't be, but I also don't think it will be too different from Akriss.<P>Just trust in the moderators common sense.
