</FONT><HR>Maybe I'm just missing something.....<P>It's been stated many times that inspecting doesn't affect anything and causes no harm. I agree, in principle. <P>Those who make this statement then go on to declare that since inspecting doesn't affect anything there is no reason to require permission to do it, and there is no reason to allow the person being inspected to have a choice about whether to allow the inspection or not. Ok, I can follow that line of reasoning, again in principle.<P>My question, though, is as follows...if inspecting doesn't affect anything and causes no harm (which we all agree is the case) then why NOT require permission or allow the person being inspected to have the choice? Is the ability to inspect other players without their consent somehow REQUIRED by some aspect of gameplay? Would limiting this ability somehow lessen the enjoyment of the game?<P>I personally don't see the reason for inspecting others without their consent, and I've never been able to come up with any valid reason why the ability to inspect without consent provides a benefit to anyone other than beggers and scam artists. If there ARE true benefits then please share them with the rest of us. I'm willing to listen to reasonable explanations.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>JUST GET RID OF THE STUPID MESSAGE AND EVERYONE WILL STOP WORRYING ABOUT IT!<P>(Ok, now that I have gotten that off my chest ...)<P>You shouldn't need permission to inspect someone because inspecting is not invasive.<P>Character graphics are extremely limited.  There are only four different graphics for armor and many pieces do not show at all.  The 3D rendering you see of someone is what you can might see of a person at a distance or a glance.  <P>Inspection is analagous to looking at someone who is a few feet away.  You can see that they are wearing some jewelry, a scaley belt, and that the tunic they wear appears to be sewn from the skin of some beast.  The amount of detail you get is still minimal.  You don't see the item stats or the contents of the person's backpack.  All you see is a name.  There is no reason you should be made aware every time someone looks at you.<P>Character profiles are also a great way to convey more information about your character.  The inspection message inhibits people from seeing this information.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Why is it so terribly important that the status quo (allowing inpection without consent) remain? Is there some reason that players SHOULD be allowed to inspect without consent?<P>Removing the message would HIDE the problem, not solve it. Why is this better than allowing players a choice whether to permit inspections or not? Isn't it possible that allowing a choice might create some rp possibilities? You can't rp with inspect now, nor could you if the message were removed to hide the inspecting.<P>Don't keep responding to these questions with the same old "you're just being too sensitive" type statements please.

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt; "Why NOT allow the person being inspected to have a choice in it."<P>Preventing people from inspecting you would be like preventing them from looking at you as you walk down the street in real life.  It would be like surrounding yourself with a static field that blurs everyone else's vision so that they can only detect that you are wearing something blue up top and white on the bottom.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt; "Why is it so terribly important that the status quo (allowing inpection without consent) remain?"<P>Simple.  There is no compelling reason to change it.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt; "Is there some reason that players SHOULD be allowed to inspect without consent?"<P>Yes, if the message were removed, there should be no problem with people looking at you.  Would you require consent before someone looked at you in real life?<P>Drawing a parallel to another game:  Back in UO, the on screen character was a fairly small and low res image.  If you actually wanted to see what someone looked like, you would bring up a paperdoll.  In the paperdoll view, you could get the names of all the pieces of visible equipment a character wore and you could read their character profile if they had taken the time to write one.  <BR>Nobody *ever* got mad about people bringing up their paperdolls.  They didn't even know when it happened, unless the person subsequently made some comment about their equipment.<P>People criticizing your choice of equipment or asking you to give them stuff are being rude, but rude people will be rude no matter what you do.  They just use the message to annoy you.  So please, Verant, remove this tool for annoyance and get rid of the inspection message.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"Why NOT allow the person being inspected to have a choice in it. Why is it so terribly important that the status quo (allowing inpection without consent) remain? Is there some reason that players SHOULD be allowed to inspect without consent?"<P>It is terribly important because the game graphics are limited and you can't tell the difference between a lot of items just by looking at the 3D model.  When EQ's graphics become that advanced where each item has it's own graphic, and everything you would normally see just by looking at someone is pictured on their avatar, THEN the case could be made that inspection might be made permission-only.  But as it stands right now, it's a necessary tool for the identification of worn/equipped items.<P>Sometimes you just need to know if that ranger who wants to join your group is using a rusty dagger or a lupine dagger.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>I agree... a chat filter for the inspection message would solve the problem.<P>Using some sort of "permission required to inspect" as a way to stop beggars from asking you for spare equipment or plat is silly.  That's what /ignore is for.  That's what a firm "No." is for.  That's what all these "Funniest things to do to newbies/beggars" threads are for.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

If you don't want to be inspected go play on a PVP server.  A consent box for inspecting?  What a laugh.  As one guy put it it is like looking for the Nike™ label on someone's shoes.  But its also the only way to tell what belt, shoulder, face, jewelery, back your character is, and to check their bio.<P>Now people spamming inspect is another story, they should make it like /consent so you can't do it every second to fix that.<P>As for these people who think its akin to "looking at the tags on my shirt", your nuts.  Tons of classes are casters and you can't tell anything but what robe they have.  Why waste everyone's time with mythical courtesy that isn't nessecary?
