</FONT><HR>It seems that Rangers are more of a skill based class.  I like the suggestions everyone is making about increasing skills such as Dodge, Parry and Ripotse.  I alawys though we had these skills as a way to protect ourselves since we do not wear the big, heavy armors.  So some kind of improvement in the defense department is needed for us. (Hit points as well). We do need some way to be able to surrvie these higher encounters. As far as disarm, why worry about it.  The mob is still gonna hit you just as hard without his weapon.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Also the ideas of improving Archery seem to fit the class as well.  That would seem to fit the imiage of a Ranger.<P>As far as the spells go it seems most of the problems are at the higher levels.  I'm only 44 now and haven't experienced the 50 to post 50 yet.<BR>The ones they are adding are nice.  But things like gate and ports ......Just don't think we'll ever get them.  We have a better chance at getting our offense and defense skills worked on then getting those.<P>The Tracking changes would be a welcome change.  I got it to skill level 200 and it's worhtless, except to track lost group memembers  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">  Sneak and Hide are okay as they are now, but I don't think the end result of a change would be what we are looking for.  I think you are asking to take the one of the Rogue defining  skills there.  Maybe the "Hey your skill worked." message would be nice.<P>Sorry I couldn't give you a bunch of numbers and formulas.  Just not a number cruncher, well except for watching my hit points get crunched by a monster  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Lets just hope something comes out of this to make us a more viable part of the group.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'll be direct and to the point. I'll give up all 2H slahing and 2H Blunt to be better at Archery and monk type defence skills. I have read earier about being in competition with warrior class and druid class. But Rangers are neither. We should rely on the bow for or Main weapon and our dual wielding offensive capabilities to finish a mob. In a group I would like to be support for the healers, Not in casting the heal spell, but in taunting a mob form the warrior after I see the OOM from the healers. A ranger is not a tank and should not be adjust to be one. A ranger is not a druid either. I would like to see the ranger become the sniper of your game. we have glimpse for our scope and spells to slow the mobs. When new track comes live we will be the best darn pullers in the game ( camo, track, harmoney and shoot ) I see lots of possibilities with the ranger, but not as a tank or as a druid. <P>I only hope that some one else thinks the same way<P>Lowly Ranger 29 <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>First of all thank you for this opportunity to have a say. I realize how much work this must be for you so I won't repeat anything you have addressed. I'll leave the numbers an such to the folks that know what their talking about and believe me they really know thier stuff)  (thanx guys)  Actually I have just 1  new issue to discuss.<P>The game was desinged for group play. Or so I've been told over and over again. However finding a group as a ranger is appaulingly difficult. One of the reasons for this is we have nothing the other classes want and are too much of a liability. Lets face it. Clerics hate us)<P>How about giving us something to make us more attractive to groups? <P>Is there a way to make a mob that is aggroed on the tracking list actually show that it is being aggroed by someone? a plus or minus sign near the name of the mob would do. <P>It would go a long way towards helping us find a group either outside or in a dungeon. Not to mention saving the gms alot of ksing petitions.<P>If it were made ranger only we just might go up a notch or two inside a dungeon known for its trains, instead of shouting for a group for hours on end. And thats no exageration on the shouting part.<P>Its something i haven't seen suggested yet so i thought i'd put it in)<P>Thanks again for listening)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor, as you skipped my posts, I have truncated them into a helpful organized shortish list for your convenience. The list is not in any order of relevance, it's just a list of the issues I saw you did not bring up, and which I feel are important.<P>1) FORAGE<BR>---------<BR>Funny thing is, with a 200 skill in forage I forage more gold, flowers, pebbles, barc... well you name it, than food and water. I actually have to buy water these days (it's true). A 30 bard I met while waiting for the Catliff (sp?) in Mistmoore a few weeks ago said all he forages is food and water. Lower cap = better than a grand master 200 skill? Same goes for tracking. Make it possible to filter Forage as with Tracking, if we're supposed to be masters of these things. Let us chose what we are looking for when foraging.<P>2) BALANCE KNIGHT PARENT GIVEN CLASS DEFINING ABILITY<BR>---------------------------------------------<BR>I stress Rangers should get a similar before/during/after fight group/targetable friendly ability/spell compared to the the class defining abilities the SKs and Paladins who were given from their respective parent classes. Summon Corpse and Ressurect. <P>No this is not self teleport. No this is not self bind. And no this isn't SoW. It *must* be group friendly or at least usable on other players than self. This should work both outdoors and indoors like our brother/sister hyrbids' given parent abilities. <P>It's pretty easy to name the ability isn't it? Considering our parent class, considering the group friendly state, considering before/during/after fight and considering that Ressurect and Summon Corpse are, in fact, reasons for chosing a Paladin instead of a Cleric, reasons for chosing a Shadow Knight instead of a Necromancer. What ability in the Ranger parent class that is all this would be a reason for chosing a Ranger instead of a Druid? I know that you know what it is. So why leave Rangers out in the cold. Why make Rangers the only hybrid that does not inherit that ability out of the three?<P>3) GROUPABILITY IN DUNGEONS<BR>---------------------------<BR>I don't know about you other Rangers out there but I'm an outdoors type of Ranger. I don't like dungeons much. Yet, we are forced to go to dungeons to get most of our best items (and experience, not to forget). And still how group friendly do you consider a Ranger to be in a dungeon situation? None at all. We have pretty much no indoor usable skill or spell. I'd like this to be changed. Indoor group-friendly skill or spell. As others have pointed out, indoors we are reduced to tanks, and we are not tanks.<P>4) FLETCHING<BR>------------<BR>Could there be a way to make fletching a trade skill worth picking up other than for being able to make your own arrows and a bow? Verant made Alchemy one of the most sweet trading skills from nothing by adding all possibility to create potions with some of the most useful abilities/buffs/spells (Various heals, buffs, SoW, IVU, TP...) I have sold 2 bows and about 200 arrows during my 51 levels. I am not at 200 skill, but a few points from. Once, mind you, once, someone asked me if I could make a bow for him. How often do you see people looking for potions? Bows? Arrows? Could fletching be made a "trade" skill? YES. Let us (no others, us = Rangers) add enchantments to our bows and arrows. Arrows with a Stun proc (if archery is tuned) will sell. Arrows with a DOT will sell. Bows with various procs will sell.<P>Also note that Alchemy together with (!) right-clickable spell armor for non-casting classes (!) greatly reduced the need for pretty much any of the hybrids (and their buffs) (I'm not counting Druids, Necromancers or Clerics, although I'd think these classes should feel the most "betrayed" by this, though ultimately it hits the hybrids as well).<P>5) HALF-ELF RANGERS<BR>-------------------<BR>And why oh why are Half-Elves treated like the least worthwhile race in the whole of EQ. We are hit with a wis/mana penalty. Wood-Elves do not. They get additional bonuses (at some point I trust - can't wait to see what this will end up like) cultural fletching and forage at earlier level. For what reason? Half-Elves have better looks? :-) I don't get it.<P>6) RANGER UNIQUE ABILITY<BR>------------------------<BR>Yes, *unique* ability. Our brother/sister SKs and Paladins get it. Rangers don't. Together with point 2) it really feels awkward. Why are Rangers left out in the cold? <P>7) TRACKING QUESTION<BR>--------------------<BR>Is it/will it be possible to change the con colors in the Tracking list? As they are now, the blue is so deep/dark blue I can't read what it says, and I have a high-end graphics card / monitor. Can we change these colors in the, say, eqclient.ini file today? Will we be able to do so?<P>8) FINAL NOTES<BR>--------------<BR>I would also like to say that I agree with<BR>a) Defense to match SK/Paladin offense.<BR>b) Venril Sathir for EPIC is just plain rude. Plane of Sky, The Hole and Innoruuk is enough to <BR>make it a really really tough quest. You're still <BR>not going to these places without a force, but you <BR>don't have to be Uber to do it. And you won't have <BR>to BUY or TRADE the VS Stone from a Wizard or <BR>Warrior because as a Ranger you pretty much don't <BR>have any function in a VS kill (even if you <BR>mysteriously somehow managed to get into an Uber <BR>guild, most, if not all, do not accept Rangers).<BR>Perhaps if a VS kill required something from a <BR>Ranger, it would help. Still the Uber guilds would<BR>still be farming him for the other drops, and for<BR>the stones. I really loathe that the Epic "Quest"<BR>is more of a "Trade/Buy items from Warriors and <BR>Wizards who are those that can get the items<BR>required" letdown.<BR>c) Thorny Vine drops in Fear. I'm 51. I wear Ivy.<BR>d) Archery and TrueShot Disc be fixed and made viable.<BR>e) Raincaller bow looked at. dmg/dly/rechargable.<BR>f) Jolt be moved, unresistable higher level type.<BR>g) Panic Animal is just wrong.<BR>h) Fix stacking Issues with Call of.. and SoN.<BR>i) Cultural Fletching. Where is it, when, what?<BR>j) Tracking improvements. Where, when?<BR>k) Keep SoW at 39. No real need for it until then.<BR>l) Spells on Kunark Armor looked at. No I don't <BR>have any Kunark Armor, but I know what the spells<BR>on them are. Most are useless watered down <BR>versions of what we already have. Summon Arrows,<BR>good. BP gate to LFay? I really don't see it.<BR>Most of us will never be able to even think about<BR>getting the BP, so this should have something<BR>really really worthwhile.<BR>m) If we're light armored low AC/HP "damage<BR>dealers" then we should have better parry,<BR>dodge and riposte than a heavy armored high<BR>AC/HP Tank, don't you think?<BR>n) Druids laugh at us when we tell them what<BR>level we get some of their spells. Ensnare at<BR>51 anyone?<BR>n) While I know we have had the discussion about<BR>retrieving arrows from a fallen mob before (last<BR>time the answer was it's a programming nightmare)<BR>it would really help a Ranger's economy. It costs<BR>us to learn the skill of making arrows, it costs<BR>us to make the arrows, and it costs us to use<BR>the arrows, and we get nothing in return at any<BR>point. It's not even a viable "trade" skill.<P>--Dark, 51 Half-Elf Ranger<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Healing: The ranger spell set for healing is ok, after all we're no healers. But why is the 'Bind Wound' skill capped at 100 (at least until 50+)? That makes the skill quite useless when it wouldn't have to be. *suggestion for new skill* An alternative for Rangers/Druids could also be 'Herbal Healing' where you could combine either bandages with different type of leaves/plants making new types of bandages- or combine water, flasks and leaves/plants into potions. <P>Tracking: Thanks for adjusting tracking slightly making it a little bit more beneficial - BUT the main problem still remains, as the skill go up and range increases you could track someone across the zone and be missing the ones next to you. One way to help the situation would be to have a scrolling list instead as someone suggested (why not with filters for how they con?). Another way to would be to stack similar creatures, and once you've selected your creature type - to enter menu number two where you can specify which individual. Third alternative could be to get only the creatures in the direction you're facing on track. <P>Archery: On anything but plain ground archery does not work. Recently when hunting in Dagnor's Cauldron, I could hardly hit anything, no miss, no hit, no nothing. Even on surfaces that were close to plain or on the same level it wasn't possible to hit. As it is now it's ten times more efficient to use a few blasts instead as soon as you're on levelled ground.<P>Agility: Like a previous poster stated it would be nice to see Agility actually making a difference to how much damage you're taking / alt how often how you're hit.<P>Spells: A welcome addition!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just to clarify something to many posters. As of a few patches ago, we no longer lose melee attacks for casting spells. Therefore the time to cast a spell is not removed from our melee damage. Please stop bringing up the fact that you can do more damage in melee in the same time as casting a spell. BTW Absor, this was an excellent fix.<P>As for spells, to balance the hybrids among themselves spell-wise. The easiest, simplest and most logical means to do this would be to make certain each hybrid had the same number of spell-levels. For example; if at level 49 Paladins gained 3 level 29 cleric spells and 4 level 34 cleric spells then rangers should get 3 level 29 druid spells and 4 level 34 druid spells (same for SK with necros).<P>As en enhancement to versatility and to make rangers more "group friendly" throwing in some shaman buffs would help. This would allow rangers to round out groups that had either druids or shamans. It's not a big thing, but it would help and fit our role as being linked to nature and beasts (druid/shaman).<P>Longetalos.   <P> <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I highly doubt that my opinion will be a popular one, but here goes...<P>I keep reading how SoW at 22 or 30 would unbalance the game. I keep reading how increased damage output from Archery would unbalance the game. I even read that Panic Animal at 22 would unbalance the game. I keep reading how Rangers need better Defense so they don't get squashed at levels 45+. <P>Defense? I'll let the 45+ Rangers argue for defense. Why? Because I won't even hit the cap for a dozen levels.<P>I'm level 27 now and I prefer to solo. I think it makes alot of sense to have a fleet-footed Woodsman rooting a MoB and filling it full of arrows. I think a Ranger of my level should be weaker in a group in a dungeon somewhere than a Warrior or Rogue who can't do this.<P>But guess what? Most of these posts address 45+ issues as if they are the only issues. Well they aren't. 45+ Rangers want to be better in groups because that's where they spend their time. I don't spend my time grouped in a dungeon waiting for a spawn. I'm sure someday I will. But for 45 levels before that I will spend my time tracking MoBs then snaring, leading them to my killing grounds, and rooting and Bow-Kiting/Igniting.<P>Moving SoW to a lower level does not help you if you are 45+, as you already have SoW. It also doesn't help you at 45+ if you are in a dungeon. It does help me as the lone Woodsman who does not want a group!<P>But Everquest is for grouping you say? I don't understand the game you say? I disagree. If I choose to sacrifice the group bonus and the opportunity to make allies then so be it. <P>I don't expect a high-level Ranger to ask for you to move spells down for us young Rangers. Why? Think about it, you are nerfing a spell. Decreasing it's value, by decreasing the time investment necessary to obtain it. You are telling that level 39 Ranger who is so happy to get SoW, that they could have had it 9 or 17 levels earlier. Sorry, bad timing. Players will never argue for nerfs, but in this case I really wish they would. Think about your roots folks!<P>How much pp can a Druid make in a day if he were my level and just ported all day? 100pp? 200pp? And how much can I make in a day? half that? one quarter? When you talk about SoW and balance you make me laugh. Is it balanced that I donate 3pp to get a SoW that lasts half an hour. Druids need the pp right?<P>What's the first spell in the SoW progression anyway? SoW? Make sense? How about SoP? Spirit of the Puppy for Rangers at level 22? Half as effective as SoW and accompanied by a high pitched whining sound?<P>Archery is not that expensive. I make 200 arrows at a time and it costs me less than 5pp. In Ill Omen at level 27 I can loot that much coin off of 8 or 9 kills. But don't all those arrows take up alot of space? One backpack of arrows and 2 slots in another is not alot of space to me, so I don't care about recovering arrows. Give it a bump in power so that I can outdamage Warriors with bows. That's a no brainer. Take away bow crits from Warriors. That's a no brainer too.<P>There are plenty of great ideas in these forums and some that are not so great. I'm not sure which category this fits in, I'll let you all decide. However, I ask you to keep these two things in mind:<P>A Warrior in full plate is my equal with a bow.<P>A Bard in full plate can outrun me even with a SoW.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>When I distributed points on my Ranger, I put many into agility.  Looking back, this was probably a huge mistake.  I still can't figure out what agi is really for.  A few more AC points?  Agility should be tied to increased parry and dodge success and Rangers should be at least the equal of warriors at parry and dodge.  Since a Ranger should have higher AGI than a Warrior, a Ranger should be able to parry/dodge better than a Warrior.<P>It's all about survivability.  About having the skills to avoid being hit to cast lifesaving spells (root, snare, heal, etc).  About there actually being a reason why Rangers do not wear plate armor.  Are they allergic or something?  As far as I know wearing plate is not against any of their religions so what's the deal?  There needs to be a game play reason for not being able to wear plate and that reason is Rangers should be able to dodge better and move quicker and more stealthy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>You made the following comment in the Paladin Talk: <BR>&gt;&gt;Every fighting class seems to want a better ability to taunt. Folks, taunt is a group thing, not an individual thing. Your group needs to be controlling their aggro. And we just can’t be setting it up so that any character can flip a switch to gain the attention of their enemy. &lt;&lt;<P>I would have to disagree with you Absor, and perhaps most Rangers may too. Rangers have been forced to control their aggro even more than Casters and definitely more than any of the melee classes. We don't even have to use the taunt button most of the time.<P>There have been some very good posts in this thread on how to help Rangers control their aggro and still be a viable melee addition to a group. Jolt being lowered to a few levels earlier (like 49-51) has been perhaps the biggest suggestion.  I think you see this suggestion by other melee groups becuase Rangers in particular tend to just get aggro'ed upon whenever they get close to combat, then its hard to get off them unless the ranger just backs out of combat.  Then what use are we as a melee class? Not much. <P>If we are talking about having a group learn to control their aggro, then Rangers should be allowed to have a more viable option than Jolt in its current form.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Archery wise..couldnt rangers get crippling hits like warriors do in melee?  This would give additional damage output to those of us who have very high archery skill.  <P>Also, could the chance of criticals be doubled on high end bows like the Raincaller?  After going thru that pain of a quest, it pains me to see as many misses and hits for 1 dmg, as when I was using a hunting bow.<P>What about more shaman buffs?

</FONT><HR>More suggestions:<P>-Rangers should be excellent at Bind Wound.  No reason not to and it fits the outdoor self-medic profile of Rangers.<P>-A couple suggestions for track.  There's already the ':' sign in the track window.  Add symbols for mobs that are in combat, or are aggroed on someone, or hurt.  Something to give more information.  Maybe we can sense hurt mobs because they leave a blood trail or something.  Whatever justification you can live with, but something to make Ranger track more precise than others.  Also, a distance tracker would be good.<P>-SOW... too late for my Ranger, but this should be given around level 30 if not before.<P>-Some sort of self-bind or self-evac.<BR>-On the same line of self-preservation thought... perhaps a way to 'hide' and have the mob not beat you to death?  Similar to feign death, but with a hide feature.  A Ranger should be skilled at confusing their trail so an aggro mob cannot find them.  Hiding behind a bush or something.  Something to temporarily make the mob not chase the Ranger across an entire zone.<P>-Give Rangers a charm animal spell so they can grab low level animals for pets.  Everyone including the Verant literature describes Rangers as friends of the forest, good and nimble wilderness folk.  In actuallity, Rangers are currently city people's wilderness trash.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree, I want Befriend animal, if only to have a pet, even if weak and useless. There are already items in game that can give anyone the spell. Pretty please? =)<P>Check out the guy's post on Deftness.  It may seem a little overpowering, but with a sufficiantly low skill check, it could be just what a Ranger needs.<P>My personal idea, unrelated to class balance but important to me.  As of the moment, I'm pretty fine with archery, except for -1- thing.  That is the cost of arrows.  Compare spells to arrows.  You do more damage with spells, mana costs you no money, only time.  Arrows, cost not only time, but lots of money as well.  I'd think it would be nice if there was a chance that every time you hit with an arrow, the arrow has a chance to show up on the corpse.<P>Warriors get Crits with bows, that doesn't seem right to me, why not give Crips to Rangers? They are after all supposed to be masters of archery.<P>Beyond that, and what has already been suggested (Higher defense, dodge, etc caps) I think thats all the Ranger needs.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>Absor,<P>Just a couple issues in response to your post,  for the most part, what you have added to the list, is exactly what I was hoping for, I just want to clear up a few things:<P>Defensive Skills:<BR>You said that upping the dodge skill was a more logical solution to improving the defense of rangers.  Please also look at Parry and Riposte, I have a strong feeling that just 1 skill improvement isn't going significantly improve our survivability.  We need to have time to cast Jolt.<P>HP:<BR>IMHO, a 200 HP increase isn't going to make a ranger any stronger, it's just going to allow us to survive an extra 3 or 4 seconds, maybe long enough to get off a un-resisted Jolt, or the healer to land a heal.  That's all I'm asking for (can't speak for other rangers here), is a chance to live long enough to get the MOB off me.<P>Trueshot Disc:<BR>You said you haven't heard much about this recently.  You must understand, many rangers are reluctant to voice their concerns, as the last time they did so, it was changed to the point that it was only a miniscule improvement over not using it, if not a downgrade in some instances.  Trueshot gave rangers something that was useful on raids like VS, something we have been lacking for a long time, as it stands now, it's still useful in this area, but is restricted to one or two very hard to get bows.  A Windsabre isn't extremely easy to get, and IMHO should be used as the baseline for setting up a damage range for Trueshot that would allow rangers to have some desirability for those raids.<P>Calador Stormblood<BR>Ranger of Tarew Marr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>First, please don't overpower us.<P>I see a lot of suggestions, and wishes in this thread. I do think that Rangers are already a very good class, and even on the verge of being overpowerer as-is in the pre-40 game. I can't stress how important I think a few minor changes are to the end game though. It's the way I see it.<P>-PLEASE, do not take Panic Animal live. It is, simply, overpowering at a period when Rangers are already one of the stronger classes, if not the strongest fighter class. I say that after personally playing 2 Rangers, a Monk, 3 Warriors, a Paladin, a Necromancer, a Wizard, a Rogue, and an Enchanter to and or through this level range(Yes I own multiple computers-accounts). Please don't make Rangers into the next d00d class.<P>-PLEASE, reconsider the pathing-placing of the new LFay Brownies. These very aggro, very hard to see, very quiet, death machines (added with the epic weapons) negativly(to differant degrees) effect the mid level Ranger quests for the Orc Impayler, Ivy Etched Leggings, Ivy Etched Tunic, and Raincaller bow. Groups of level to do these quests(read camps) can not survive these brownies.<P>-Please seriously consider lowering the casting cost of Jolt. You didn't seem to take that seriously. It is a spell that needs to often be cast several times per mob. Hybrids can not focus their gear on casting stats. Hyrbids also start with less than great casting stats (example: Half Elf Rangers start with 65 Wis.) the have very small mana pools. This spell has too many dowsides already (like ADDING aggro of fizzle-resist-decreaseing damage output). It cam oom a hybrid very fast.<P>-Please, take the massive drive to up defense to 220 or 230 by 60 seriously, at least on test to try it for yourselves. It does not return the Ranger(one of the four taunt skill classes) to a tank by any means. A level 60 fighter, and the highest natural taunt fighter, is much too crippled with a level 39 defense. Just please take it seriously, your quote used incorrect caps for compairison. If test changes go live every fighter except Rangers will have 252 defense (Rogue, Monk, Bard, Shadow Knight, Warrior Paladin). Rangers, Druids, and Shaman have 200 defense. Rangers are the only fighter that did not recieve a defense upgrade with the introduction of the 50-60 game. All others recieved both offensive and defensive upgrades with the 50+ game. Rangers already have low AC Armor, Low HP, Low Dodge, Low Parry, Low Risposte. It is a very heavy penalty for being, what is arguably, the worst damage dealer of those classified as damage dealing fighters(especially when they burn all of their mana on Jolt). Please just take it seriously.<P>-There is a very good reason that people said pretty much the same thing over and over. It was not to give you a hard time reading. 50+ Defense, if nothing else; is a very big issue for Rangers. Please just take it seriously.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Slows the enemy down enough for everyone to run for it--assuming it works since it would have the normal save of a snare spell.<P>c) Evacuation spell similar to druids<P>None of these are overpowering except maybe the evac spell, all of them can be class-defining, and best of all, these will give Rangers that one solid thing that makes them desirable in groups.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, increasing Dodge and Parry to increase the "defense" of Rangers is inadequate.  The last "upgrade" Rangers received in this category decreased our chance to be hit by less than 2%, in most parsed logs.  With this information, you could give us 20 more points in BOTH Dodge and Parry, and it STILL would be less effective than giving us 10 in Defense.  The Defense skill is MUCH more effective and creating damage "dodging" than either of dodge or Parry.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Rangers need an increase in HP's and Defense skill.  This will give Ranger's SURVIVABILITY, not tanking ability.  A player with 9,000 hitpoints and zero AC is NOT going to be able to tank.  A player with 2,000 AC and 500 Hps is not going to be able to tank.  What makes a class a good tank?  High hitpoints and High AC.  Why do monks and rogues, two "damage dealing" classes have such high defensive skill if they are meant to deal damage instead of take it.  They have it so that the MOBs miss more often when they aggro on them.  It doesn't let them tank!  Honestly, should a thief-type Rogue have more hitpoints and higher Defense and AC than a Ranger?  Yes, a Ranger should not be able to tank, but since a Warrior is our parent class, we should be able to "survive" longer than a Rogue if the aggro turns on us.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>     Hope you make it all the way through all the previous posts to those of us down at the bottom. Though some of what I will say may be repetative I think the repetative nature of these posts will give you an idea of the nature of what us Rangers are looking for. Thank you for the changes that have been made so far. They have been a great help.<P>1) DEFENSE: Increase Parry/Dodge/Riposte since we are so light on our feet with our lower AC and leave Defense where it is.<P>2) AGGRO: Jolt was a waste of time to add but was the right idea. Level is to high and effectivness is to low.<P>3) ARCHERY: Please look at adding more Archery disciplines to Rangers as it is suposed to be our defining attacking ability. Also raise the Archery skill cap for Rangers to higher than any other Archery using classes.<P>4) TAUNT: I never use my taunt ability because I already piss off mobs more than most Warriors and Rogues that are within 3 levels of me... so why add more aggro to my already sizable aggro pool?<P>5) ARMOR: I am fine with lower AC on armor but would like to see more ability stats on the Ranger only armor as well as more Ranger only armor. <P>6) SPELLS: Since we are lighter then allow us access to more Agility and Dex buffs of our own. this will help our Archery and defense skill without touching our current stats.<P>7) BIND: I think Gate is silly for a Ranger to have but I think it is by no means unbalanced for a Ranger to be able to bind himself (ie. park himself and set up a camp). Give Rangers the ability to bind ourselves but only outdoors since we are supposed to be the masters of the outdoors.<P>8) HIT POINTS: Our hit points are a joke (not meaning to be rude). Im not asking that we be on par with Warriors but some increase would be nice since we are expected to melee like them.<P>9) DUAL WIELD: If Rangers are the masters of Dual Wielding then please increase the cap on it for Rangers or stop saying we are the masters of it. =)<P>That's my opinion.

</FONT><HR>This is a post about Rangers by an ex-one.<P>I admit to not having read every listing on the board as I did not have the time to read them all.<P>I will re-iterate here something that I posted in general discussion as well as other issues.<P>1)  I think skill caps for all skills below 100 for ALL classes should be raises to minimum to become a "master" .  I.E.  Hide/sneak should be at least 100, or 101, which ever is mastery as a max.  The same goes for riposte and any/all other skills that cap below the equivalent of a level 20 character of any class that has the skill as a main skill.  This applies to all classes, mainly all melee/skill classes.  Paladins and archery for example.  Raise it to 101 (again, this could be 100)  I have a post on the main general board that goes further in depth about this but I decided to reiterate it here because I know this will be read by Absor.  <P>2)  Rangers are the swift hybrids with higher damage output and less defensive capability.  As such, certain things seem to be obvious.  <BR>   a)  Dodge should be one of the main skills or at least pretty high.<BR>   b)  Defense should definitely be less than paladins, shadowknights, warriors and probably at least equal to rogues, bards..etc.  Perhaps somewhere in between those.  <BR>   c)  Rangers do not need higher defense, as long as the offense is raised to match the deficiency<P>3)  Archery:  it is the symbol of the class and we should be the masters.  It should also be a viable option for a ranger to stand back and shoot a bow at a target and have it do some viable damage.  I have no overall suggestion.  I do not know crit rates or if there is a damage minimum, but it seems that if these can be controlled, then they should be at least equal to what a warrior's numbers are with melee.  I'm not saying that rangers should be able to do as much damage, but I am talking about the numbers, the code, behind the crits.  Should be able to crit at least as often as a warrior does in melee with a bow.  <P>4)  Spells:   You have greatly improved the ranger spells since I left the class and it makes it much more attractive.  Certain things that I always thought interesting:  <BR>    Our damage shields always were very minimal compared to the monsters.  We receive them at a higher level than the druids for a reason, but perhaps we were given too much of a slower progression in this line for a while.  It seems at least at the higher end this is taken care of.<BR>    Since we are one of the two "outdoor master" classes with druids, we seem to get certain spells left off the list or very late.  Perhaps this is the "wish list" idea, but I do think that movement is one of the keys and SoW could have been a level 30 spell.  No sooner would be appropriate but by this time, the druid has had it for 16 levels, the shaman for 21 and the bard has had his speed song for 25.  16 levels off seems like long enough to wait for this.  In fact, I think some type of scaling system for all hybrids would have worked for initial balance.  Like a system where by level 20, you can get level 9-11 spells of your spell-casting parent.  By level 30, up to 14-16.  By 40, spells of 18-24 (have to expand it here if SK are to benefit)...that one might be too high but I dont think so.  I think about half the level plus 5 or so would be a great way.  That would have been a great base and you could add, subtract, move from there.  <P>Anyway, time to get back to work. :-P<P>Hope everyone has a good day and thanks for taking the time to read this.<P>Jason, <BR>AKA Aerdyn on Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am a low level ranger (24) and I see from the posts here that I would not be welcome in high level groups when I get to that level. I dont want to solo my upper levels. I want to provide skills to my group.<P>There have been many ideas put forward to make a ranger a wanted member of a group. The problem, as I read it, is the hate list. We are damage dealers that end up at the top of the list. We MUST control this. JOLT, as I see it, is a poor answer because it just does not work and is given much too late.<P>I think we need a SKILL that "untaunts" us to number two or three on the hate list.

It would work just like the TAUNT skill in skill check and amount it changes the hate ammout the mob has for the ranger.<P>==========<P>Other points:<P>SOW - self SOW at 22 and keep current SOW at 39<P>self BIND - without gate or port - we know the land so why not let is bind with it.<P>AC - Please look at our armor choices and up the AC we can get.<P>HP - In reading the posts here I see we need some more in the upper game if for nothing else but to keep us from a quick death.<P>Parry/Dodge/Riposte - WE MUST get these upped.<P>DISARM - I dont have this yet but from what I read it's a joke - up it or put the points some where else.<P>see invis - I hate casting CAMO in my group because we cant see each other.<P>there are other things I would like but as these were stated before - I would just be repeating what many others have said.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I know some of this will be redundant, but I feel there are 5 major issues for rangers.<P>1) Tracking... great changes planned. I greatly look forward to the day I can track all in range according to /con and proximity.<P>2) Archery... In order for Trueshot to be a good discipline it needs to do more dmg than melee with an obtainable weapon (i.e. raincaller or some new fletched bows). Implimenting rare "uber" bows doesn't fix the problem. It would be nice to have Trueshot be Ranger defining ability where, like Locz said, people say, "Wow, look at what the Ranger did!"<P>3) Offense... Moving Rangers offensive skills up 10 points doesn't help that much and probably will end up stepping on Warriors toes... whether the change goes live or not, I don't think it will matter much. (Also remember this only affects high lvl Rangers).<P>4) Defense... This is the BIG one. In order to make myself clear let's look at a lvl 50 warrior, ranger and rogue.  The ranger & rogue have 3/4 the HP of a warrior and on avg. probably 50-75 AC less than a comparably equiped warrior.  At lvl 50 all 3 have the SAME defense skill, 200. Now even with the same defense I would say that with having both less HP and lower AC the Ranger/Rogue have a Time To Death (TTD) of about 50-60% the warrior.  There is no way anyone will accuse me of being a heavy tank at lvl 50. Now, as you move through the 50's the warrior and rogue's AC increases due to higher defense, but the rangers does not... thus the rogue will remain at about 50-60% TTD as the MOBS get harder, but the ranger will drop to maybe 40% TTD or lower.  Does this make sense? If the ranger had a offense of 252 and a defense of 252, he would not equal to a warrior. He would have the offensive capabilities of a warrior and the defensive capabilities of a rogue.  With a 252/252 he is obviously neither a complete warrior, nor a complete rogue...the difference is made up by his spells...(and perhaps lowering the off/def cap to 240) (and yes, this only affect 50+ Rangers, but isn't that the lvl range that most Rangers are saying isn't balanced?)<P>5) Spells... I think the changes on test for spells are great, they help Rangers in group situations contribute to the party more. The only change I would make is Call of Earth.  This spell is redundant to spike shield, with a shorter duration.  Instead of Call of Earth, I'd like to see Rangers get regen at 50... I mean we already get chloro at 55...This would give us another group friendly spell instead of a redundant buff that seems more of a band-aid to fix low defense. And a last note, when considering balance of classes, the only spells that truly affect our balance with rogues and warriors are our self only spells (wolf-form, dmgcoat, etc) While our spells are nice, they do not raise our value in a group...which is where everyone wants the classes to be balanced.<P>Lastly, thank you for providing the only class I will ever want to play in Everquest...<P>Taylen Arenson<BR>Ranger of 51 Seasons<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor I would just like to point our a couple of things.<P>The Knight Hybrids recieved 225 in weapon skills and 230 in Offense, not 215.<P>Yes I would like to repeat on the Hitpoints issue.  We are not asking for Warrior Hitpoints <P>Our Defense skill will be lower or Armor is lower AC and our Hitpoints do need to be adjusted.  Don't really know by how much but we should have a few hundred more at 60 than now.<P>The Idea of using Mana to supplement our AC and Hitpoints when we should have this as part of the base is wrong.  <P>Having us use mana to control the Agro is extremly hard on an already small mana pool.  My mana is currently around 1500 and during the course of a fight with Level 52+ mobs I find that I must cast this 4 or 5 times ( resists or ignores it )  At 240 to 300 Mana per fight used for Agro adjustment that leaves very little for Offensive spells.  5 mobs and I am OOM from just agro adjustments.  We are a Melee so we don't stand up and cast then sit back down to med.  We usually start the day off with full mana and within 20 mins we are LOM the rest of the night.  We have no mana except for Jolt and Snare.  God Help us trying to keep Regen, Strenth of Nature and Call of Earth up.  Hardly use Call of Fire because of the extra taunt.  With this we really need to have C2 and Bard song going to be effective with our mana besides agro management.<P>What I am asking is this to be looked at for the cost in mana or for our equipment to be retroactively upgraded with some wis stats.  Without this most Rangers are fighting with around 1-2 bubbles of Mana and this is only for emergencies.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Rangers had the same HP as other hybrids, and had higher Defensive skills (was in-character for being light and agile).<P>Then as they increased AC and HP on Warriors, it became clear that Knights didn't tank significantly better because their quest armor AC was too close to Ivy Etched AC.  To compensate, they added more HP to Knights.<P>The trouble is, that only existed for one class of armor (and it was neglected that Knights got bronze and stuff like that while Rangers were still in banded).  Planar Knight armor has significantly higher AC than Thorny Vine.  What's more, in spite of Rangers being light and agile, Knights are being given much higher Defense.<P>What this means is that now Rangers are paying a triple-penalty for Dual-Wield: AC (as originally intended), Defense and HP.<P>Since Knight AC on Planar, Kunark and Velious armor is significantly higher than the equivalent Ranger armor, this triple-penalty is unjustified.<P>Further, Rangers are the ONLY melee class past 50 who receive a single HP bump.  All others receive at least two.<P>Finally, this results in Ranger HP being closer to casters than their hybrid kin.  Is it really intended that Rangers have caster hit points, and not HP closer to other hybrids?<P>-----------------------------<BR>The case for raising Defense:<BR>-----------------------------<P>See above for a description of the triple-penalty.<P>Why do we need defense raised?  We get hit more by mob ripostes because we dual-wield faster weapons.  This can result in significantly more hits per fight.  Our spells are all high-agro, and so are our weapons.  My defining weapon, the weapon Verant designed just for me as a Ranger, has a huge taunt on it.<P>Finally, it is in-character.  Defense is damage-avoidance, exactly what a "light agile" melee class should have.  Before the recent proposed changes in Defense for other hybrids and Clerics, high Defense was given to Rogues and Monks (and Warriors just because they're the master tankers).  Before level 51, it's given to Rogues, Monks and Rangers.  See a pattern?<P>Finally, after the proposed upgrades on test, we come up with this:<P>------- Off / Def<BR>Ranger: 252 / 200 : 452<BR>Knight: 230 / 250 : 480<BR>Ranger balance: -28<P>There is no compelling feature in the Ranger list of abilities that justifies this skill gap.<P>Please see my detailed post on Page 1 of the original thread for a more detailed analysis.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 8 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055463-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055463.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055463-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055463-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055463-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055463-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055463-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;7&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055463-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055463&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055463&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
