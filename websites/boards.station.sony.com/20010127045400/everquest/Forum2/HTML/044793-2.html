If they have to be resisted some of the time, that's ok -- as it is now our mainstay spell line (and mainstay strategy) is impossible to do on a raid.<P>3:  Remove the Ignite Bones/Chill Bones illusion.  You're right, it's just another DD spell, but that's just fine.

Lifetap lures are SUCH a good Idea and its ONLY a raid consideration but they stubbornly cling to the view that only wizards get lures.  What a waste of creative thinking.  Such Lifetap lures are easily implemented and would not overpower Necros in other encounters.<P>They are the way to go, All pure casters should get some type of lure (nerfed version of the Wizard one or completely different) to be able to damage the Uber-mobs.  All Classes should be Able to contribute damage if need be in a Raid type encounter.<P><BR>Think about this Absor, its the way to go and Verant should Realize this!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I can't believe people are asking for so many things.  All I wish, is for the necro life tap not get resisted so much.  Ignite bones/dots - tanks don't like it because it has a high taunt factor, and trying to get the mob off of us is one more thing they shouldn't have to worry about(mind u i haven't tried this on Cazic was told from the getgo not ot).  The fact is that if we are to be a mana battery, thats fine, just give us a way to get our health back.  I don't really care about the ratio subversion has (it sucks but i will live with it).  How can a life tap do a lot of damage compared to other classes?  My current lvl is 52, my life tap hits less then 350 with a long cast time, does this even make a dent?  I have to question, should i have picked a different specialization. When I first started a necro (my first character) i noticed that since day 1, i have had a life tap spell.  This was my spell, alteration, so i had to specialize in it.  If i would have know that i would be the dmf king, i would have picked abjuration, or should i have picked conjuration for summon corpse?  Give us the ability of being all we can be, i want to be a necro, i want to tap.<P>MT server<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Another thing to think about:<P>Necro taps ARE lures.  They are NOT resists in 95% of situations out there.  This changes in the "uber encounter" (since you don't like the term end game) for no logical reason.  Taps, for the most part, are weak.<P>Our only usable tap OVER 360 damage is Touch of night at 59.   While wizards and mages do damage at more than this Pre 50...<P>Its not a matter of giving necros lures, its about removing these artificial limitations on the one ability which makes a necro, well, a necro.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

It should be fixed for any NPC over 54th level already, and we're making a change that should fix most instances of poofing at any level. Yes, if you do all the damage to an NPC and manage to do the killing blow while Lind Dead, the corpse will disappear. That won't change. But nearly all other instances of poofing should be gone as of the next patch, and all of them for over 54th level NPCs should already be gone.<P>Truth:<P>Ragefire poofed last night, a non-LD wizard got the killing hit...and you say this.<P>HOW FUNNY THIS IS!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor thank you for discussing the necromancer problems.  But please consider this:<P>The necroamancers Class Defining Ability is his ability to take hitpoints from mobs and heal himself.<P>By making so many uber mobs (and yardtrash for that matter) in Velious so magic resistant you have totally taken away our class defining ability.<P>We CAN NOT Lich if we can't regain our hitpoints.. I dont care that the conversion rate is broken... its useless if we cant tap the mobs.<P>We therefore CAN NOT transfer mana constantly in our "afterthought" group friendly role as mana battery if we cant keep lich running. <P>Since we CAN NOT lifetap..we can't play secondary healer (our other group "group friendly afterthought" role)<P>Life taps need to be resisted less so we can perform our class defining role.<P>Look at the efficiency of the wizard lure series versus lifetap.  The maximum my necromancer could do damage wise on an uber mob with one load of mana is 3,300 dmg if all my level 54 Deflux lifetaps stuck.  A wizard routinely does 2-3x that with lure series.  Lifetap was around long before Lure ever came out... it used to be unresistable..then it had a level cap put on it..  now its getting useless.<P>Who KS'd someone at verant and made them hate necromancers so much? It wasnt my necro.  I've summoned countless corpses for strangers..even paying for the coffins myself on occasions.. I've located corpses for people .... I"ve been grouped 90% of my necros life.. <P>I guess the reason your giving Shadow Knights Summon Corpse is because they're gonna be the only people left to summon corpses when all the high level necromancers quit playing.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

This means that when Lich takes hit point from you, it's only taking 2/3 as many as it should. So you are currently getting a 1 for 1 exchange of hit points for mana with that spell.<P>We have not decided to repair this bug. It seems that we won't.<P>But when you're calculating your efficiency, keep this in mind.<P>Ayama:<P>Necromancers with a clue know this.  Honest ones reported it immediately, and got no response.<P>Glad to see its confirmed, its not a bug, and in 3 months you'll change your mind and call it a bug and fix it...what else is new.<P>So regrowth lets us keep going forever (until it runs out anyway).   Unfortunately we don't eat enough life fast enough to make a difference when we need 1200+ mana to give 1 CH....probably needed a minute ago since the rate we can give mana is S-L-O-W.<P>Either way without lifetaps our efficiency is irrelevant, we cannot control our HPs like we do everywhere else.<P>So this argument is moot.<P>Ayama</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan said:<P>&gt;"I really don't like how giving one thing to one class inevitably brings out a request for something also to be given to another class.<P>Think about this for a moment. If we add something to a class, it's usually to help bring them up to par with the rest of the classes in some facet, that's the whole idea of balance. Turning around and 'compensating' other classes for this sort of negates the whole balance thing, now doesn't it? IF any of the changes currently on the Test server make it into the game, they will be done on their own merit, and there won't be any 'consolation prizes' for other classes because of them. The whole idea is pretty silly. This isn't a contest."&lt;<P>That just doesn't make sense to me.  Maybe I'm wrong, but that doesn't look like what Verant has set out to do with Classes.  If what you say is the case, they may as well give resurection to paladins, teleportation to rangers, and clarity for everyone.  I'm not being sarcastic, but this is what you are implicating.<P>I thought Summon corpse was about the only thing special to a Necromancer.  Shadow knights have harm touch among many necromancer spells already.  In fact, shamans have alchemy, enchanters have enchant spells, magicians have various summons (like mana rods), wizards have evacs, druids have evacs, clerics have resurection with xp.  Should the sub classes get special money making skills as well as these classes?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I find it a bit frustrating about all of the complaints that I am hearing.  I have played several classes in Everquest to post 50 including and Enchanter, Magician, and most recently Necromancer.<P>Posts like this often end up doing more harm then good.  People want 10 billion changes to classes when they should focus on the one or two real problems that are in existence and get them resolved.<P>The place of a Necromancer in big raids is that of support.  It's no different then the role that several other classes have on large raids as well.  <P>Take for example the Enchanter class.  What does this class do against Trakanon?  They buff pre-battle and maybe dump a Tash or chain Rune V tanks during the conflict and that’s it.  Ask an Enchanter the last time they landed a DD on Trakanon.  Does this mean that Enchanter spells should be changed as well?  <P>A Necromancer fits in to this same support role.  We do this using a variety of methods.  Some of these include using Harmshield to make critical pulls (such as the PoF Temple) or to put Trakanon in place in his lair in Sebelis, we can give other classes our mana so that they can better function or get that last heal in to save the day, we have pets that can tank mobs (even uber) that do damage, we can scout and recover corpses using feign death, we heal using our pact series of spells, and when a raid fails we can easily summon the corpses to the zone.  This is how I see my role, and play my role of the Necromancer.  If you expected that, post 50, you could have a 59 pet running around nuking uber mobs at the effectiveness of a wizard, then you should have played a wizard in my humble opinion.  There has to be class diversity.<P>There is an issue that does exist that is a HUGE and that is corpse poofing.  It happens.  I have used /bug and submitted multiple threads on this exact topic month after month and they were ignored.  I listed 5 to 6 different reproducible scenarios where this would happen and Verant never officially acted nor responded to them.  These bugs don't only affect the Necromancer class; they affect any DOT casting class or weapon.<P>In closing I would rather see classes balanced and problems addresses one or two at a time, rather then asking for the world.  Most of the times when people ask for the world, skills and abilities that people may have not realized exist come into focus, and in the past have even been nerfed.   The DOT corpse poofing bug does need to be fixed, and Verant needs a better method in tracking real bugs like this so it doesn’t take a thread of ten plus pages to get their attention.<P>My two copper,<P>Istari, 57th Level Necromancer, MT<BR>Relentless Ascension<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor<P>I think you are under evaluating the time of post 50+ people on raids.  No it is not a tiny bit of my time in playing EQ but a large part of my time post 50.  I am in my low 50s and this past week I have done Kedge (Phinny for mage staff), Chardok (All the Royals but Queen), and am scheduled to do a three day planes raid starting tomorrow.  All this in one week!!<P>Why should Verant define for us what the "end game" is?  Verant will not define any classes role so why should they define what a player considers the end game?  I personally prefer to go on raids and engage the truely powerful entities in the lands and planes.  I may never reach lvl 60 that is not my goal.  My goal is to do raids and take down the uber mobs.  Personally, when my role on the truely BIG FIGHT is NOT in line with my charaters defining abilities and it is anti-climatic because their is a sense of uselessness it is truely sad.  Being a mana-battery might be "somewhat" useful but it is NOT CHALLENGING!  If a game's ending is anti-climatic why bother to play the game?  If I cant do what I am designed to do (BTW Necros are offensive by your design just as they are not a SUPPORT class by your design) then why bother? Why play the game if I cant contribute in the manner I ENJOY.  I ENJOY being offensive, I do NOT enjoy being defensive or supporting in nature.  Asking me to change my role now is unfair, changing the rules midstream is unfair, NOBODY likes being the bench warmer we all want to play and SCORE!<P>Thank you for your time and thoughts Absor</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Hello,<P>Alot of this comes down to that yes we may be a good class with useful spells but when it comes to crunch time necro's come up short.  I will give my reasons.<P>One-necros are a solo class, will explain further.<P>Two-necros need time, will explain further<P>Three-our group spells are not compelling, will explain further<P>On point one, just as has been stated several times, dots will not stack further.  In effect this makes multiple necro's in a raid almost pointless for the fact that to assign one/two dots for each necro to use is almost worthless.  To limit a class to doing 1k damage every 90 seconds is a bit limiting.  This is also assuming there are not extra shamans at all, or a shaman that is casting his dots.<P>On point two,  most dots take at least 30 seconds to work, most 60 and the best at least 90.  When you raid Fear or anywhere else, when does a mob live this long?  Hell, even now with SoV and the new mobs with high amounts of hp I am not seeing them last much longer.  Case in point, on a Kael raid, have gaints that have a ton of hp.  We killed all the way up to the Prophet of Tallon.  He still didnt stay alive for even one of my dots to wear off.<P>On point three, yes we have some useful spells but none are compelling in a raid situation.  Yes DMF is a nice spell and I use it alot, but its best use in raids is for the PR on it, that and it takes a long time to cast and has a recast time.<P>Mana transfers.  They are very inefficient and have a recast time on them.  That and they only transfer mana in small chunks.  The best one is Sedulous subversion 400 of our mana to 150 mana to target.  Look at this, assume I hae 2400 mana, this is six casts target gets 900 mana.  It takes me 66 seconds of casting time with the recast time to do this.  Each infusion of mana is not eve enough to cast remedy.  So I need two infusion of mana to be of use to a cleric which takes me 22 seconds.  In a planes environment its easier just to take another cleric if healing is going to be that close.  We are a bandage in case of an emergency and not even a very good one.  The best senario I have seen for this spell so far is in group buffing before a raid to help shorten the time but even then its not that dramatic.<BR>The pact series is very nice but not very useful.  In a raid even or any high lvl area now mobs do way too much damage for our heal to work or even save someones life in time.  It is useful when fighting old world mobs because it will keep up with their damage an help on the heal but when fighting kunark or sov the mobs deal so much damage so fast that a palty 300 hp over 20 seconds or so does not make much of a difference.  This is only 2 more hits, assuming the mobs waits to hit the tank again.  So the idea we can save a tank is too little to late.<BR>Summon corpse, its very nice spell, no doubt about it but then this is a depressing spell to cast.  It makes me a hero but this is hopefully what a raid is not about, corpse recovery.  This is by far our best raid spell imho, yet it does nothing during the raid which is what we want.<P>So all in all, our contributions are minor, multiple necro's in a raid contribute a minor amount of damage.  Our pets often become a liability.  One necro is all that is needed, so that we can Summon corpse if needed.  Put 4 of us in a raid and we offer very little.  Our dots wont all stack so we each can only use maybe one.  So very little damage where as a wiz/mag all increase power the more you have.  Our pets are our best source of steady damage in a raid yet there are many situations where we cannot do anything with them for fear of bad pathing or fear of our pets getting feared.  Our heals are not very effective either and use up our precious hp we use to make more mana which is what everyone seems to assume we are there to do, infuse them with very small amounts of mana every 11 seconds.<P>Wether you agree with it or not most of us necro's are a bit disgusted with our raid or high lvl group role.  We join a group and we become handicapped, give us the same mob and us solo and we can kill it.  Its not murder we are asking for or to increase our power ten fold.  I myself would give up some of my solo ability in the post 50 range if I could just have a compelling group role.  That is what we ask nothing more.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan:<P>On your comments regarding 'balancing' by giving uniqueness from one class to another class:<P>Uniqueness is only unique when it is one of a kind.  Rogue backstab, Pure melee disciplines, Cleric resurrection, and now Necromancer summon corpse were once unique.  Now, in very specific ways, they are not.<P>Your approach to class balance is the exact opposite of what I think it should be:  instead of making classes more alike, you should work to make them more different.  Instead, you're taking short cuts to 'balance'.<P>It is the essential character specifically of Americans but of people in general to feel that if you 'take' something from them using your power without compensating them, then you have done an injustice to them.  That is the nature of the request for compensation when you make a class less unique in the interest of balancing another class.<P>By the way, I really don't believe you when you say this response from players confuses you.  I believe you understand fully what the point is and you are trying to distract attention from lackluster 'balancing' efforts.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>    From my experience on large raids I personaly think necro's arnt as bad as some of these people are saying.... I have a 740 dmg drain that i can hit almost anything with except for of coarse the "uber" bosses but im sure mages and enchanters have the same problems as necro's are haveing but maybe even worse since we have a backup plan (mana transfer).<P>   The 2 issues i do think that need to be adressed is the Ignite bones and Chill bones lines which make mob's skeleton's for no apparent reason except to keep necro's from chain nukeing that DD (its an illusion spell so a lower lvl necro can't overwrite it) there would be no overall power increase in the spell by simply removeing the illusion affect because what somone pointed out to me is if i change a mob into a skeleton with 15+ tanks on it there will be so much lost melle dmg from "cannot see your target" messages from the melle's that the small amount of dmg that nuke does will no where near compensate for it.<BR>  <BR>   The 2nd issue that i see is more of a whine but i have to say it cuz i really want an answer from verant on this one cuz it really does boggle me...  The lvl 60 Velious spell for necromancers Arch Lich as far as i can tell is in no way, shape, or form better then the lvl 60 Kunark spell Demi Lich... The ratio on Arch Lich (Velious) is .64516 which is 31 hp for 20 mana per tick, the ratio on Demi Lich (Kunark) is .64583 which is 48 hp for 31 mana per tick...<P>The problem is that the "ticks" are the same time per tick... So basicly Arch Lich is a DOWNGRADE of Demi Lich because the tansfer rate is half the speed with the same ratio because all "ticks" are the same speed. I could understand Arch Lich's transfer rate being lower if it was more a better ratio which of coarse it is not.  So as far as i can tell and being a lvl 60 necromancer i can testify to this.... That the spell Arch lich might as well just be Illusion: Spectre and personaly that is "neat" but it is not worthy of being a lvl 60 Velious spell.  Oh and just on a side note Spectre form has a built in "human" sight!!! so if your a spectre getting 2x less mana then you would in demi lich, you can also be blind! =)<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ideas for making Necros a use in raids.<P>1) Make level 50+ level pet skell immune to fear type spells<P>2) Make infusion targetable 1000mana. Still a worthless spell, but hey if a wiz, cle, enc, ect wants to sacrifice thier exp for 1000mana at least we might actually cast this spell.<P>3) Make trunication lifetap unresistable on all mobs. It is a 1000point and costs one death, again some necro might actually cast it, I doubt it, but there would be a slight chance.<P>4) Make Necro nuke overwrite necro nuke. If you can actually get two necros on a raid they could both cast, sure they will both get resisted almost every time, but they can feal like they are doing damage.<P>5) Take corpse poofing out of the planes, VP, ect.  If a LD player kills a mob in the planes why should it poof? No NPCs fight each other in the planes, there are no guards, ect. This is not a newbie zone that people can train NPCs to guards and loot the bodies. Same thing to dots, NPCs can't take falling damage, and if they die by the dot of a dead player it should not poof. Not every mob that gives armor is 55th level. <P>This should apply to all zones that require keys or level 46 access to get there.<P>6)Make undead creatures undead. Dracolich? A skeleton? A ghost?  These are what most people see as undead creatures, please set the flags on anything with a skelly or ghost model to be undead.<P>7) Make the rogue pet evade, and the monk pet FD when about to die. Ok, maybe that is a pipe dream.<P>This list is in no way overpowering, unballancing, and bar #1 & #7 are just things that could be considered as bug fixes.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Am I the only one who just doesn't get this.  We are too powerful to do any damage at all?  Having us hit an uber mob that has thousands and thousands of hp's with a few deflux's would throw the game out of balance?

Gee I never got asked for a buff before lvl 44.  And if my primary function in groups is mana battery, then why is my mana spell so undeniably pitiful?  I never heard anyone asking for mana unless I needed a tp or a rez.  Now all of a sudden, it's my primary lot in life.<P>I didn't play my Necro for 9 months to sit on my butt and watch others have the fun of doing the killing.  Sure, I could still get enjoyment out of being a very minimal part of the group, but that's not what I wanted to do when I started this game.  That's why I didn't chose a shaman, enchanter, or cleric.  I must have missed the character description that said I was only going to be the master of damage over time and lifesucking until it came time for the big payoff.  Then necros get to be the team trainer and evil cheerleader.<P>And I'm so tired of hearing how powerful we are.  Is my guild the only one where druids and wizards quad kite?  I sure can't do that. <P>I just can't believe that such a radical change in character play can be fair.  We don't ask the warrior to just  sit there serve as life taps for us while the we kill mobs.

</FONT><HR>I think the main problem stems with Verants opinion that necros "rock in all ways during lvl 51 to 60 except for raids".  Absore, Please tell me exactly what those other ways are, because maybe we aren't playing the same game.  Unless you are soloing in skyfire, which necros are only "on par" with at least 2 other classes, then "raids" are the ONLY thing left.  Saying that "necros rock in all ways except for raids" is saying that a necro rocks in "nothing".<P>I saw this coming too with Alans statement:  "raids are a small part of the game"<P>BS.<P>Raids are THE ONLY GAME after lvl 50.  If anyone thinks this is not true, please tell me how they get deep into sebilis, charasis, veeshans peak, the planes, Keal, Skyshrine, Western Wastes, Sirens Grotto, Dragon Necropolis, Sleepers Tomb, ect, solo or with a small group. <P>Alan, please, please don't insult our intelligence by trying to tell us that multi group encounters are only a "small part" of the high lvl game.  Has anyone noticed the quests in Vellious?  Nearly **all** of them require at least 3 decent groups.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>  I have a few questions.<P>1)  How can some people that have never played a necro for more than 3 levels know enough about the class to say that our complaints are unfounded and unworthy of being looked into?  I fail to see what information they are basing their claims that Necros are easy to play from, they are not.  They are actually a hard class to play WELL.  Any moron can kite, but it takes some skill to do it well, and to group well.<P>2)  How can people be okay with having their role changed from damage dealer to support class?  If you liked support class why did you not start a bard?  I am not saying there is anything wrong with people being okay with this.  But I am very upset about our role changing, I do NOT want to be a mana battery.<P>3)  Who is the guy at Verant that hates necros so much?

</FONT><HR>Absor, <P>I still dont understand why mana transfer cant be one to one.  The only way I can see that this would double a necromancers mana pool is that because our spells are close to the most inefficient for mana, if not the worst.  By being able to channel that into say a wizard, we could in a sense get twice the dmg we do with our own mana.  Really the mana drain effect doesnt play a part of this.  Consider, other classes with clarity 2, get mana almost as fast as we do.  I would bet that if you timed it, the difference would be neglegable.  So if we are going to be a battery we should at least be able to transfer it efficiently.  <P>As for Taps, just make them a bit less resistable.<P>As for ignite bones, there are only a few MoBs in the game that this would be ablicable on.  Cant your artists just make a skeleton for each of them.  And have them change to that specific skeleton.  Really if you looked most of the skeletons have already been designed in the game.  Vennril Sathir (iksar skeleton), Dragons( there is a skeleton for a dragon already in the game), really all you would have to do is make one for the gods, and then you could just scale the skeletons larger.  Although you have yet to implement a skeletal version for iksar necros for lich spells so I doubt that Verant has the ability and/or desire to do this.  <P>If you really want to make us more useful all you have to do is make the mana transfer a bit more efficent and give us some sort of DD or Lifetap spell that works decently (does a reasonable amount of damage for the mana, isnt resisted by everything, not specific to any MoB, doesnt have a 20min recast time, and doesnt have such a high taunt that it kills us everytime we use it.)  If you feel we need to pay a price for it, get rid of all the essence emerald spells, they are to costly anyway.    <BR>  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

What if an item were created that had to be in the range slot or something that gave necro pets a immunity to fear, or a higher risistance, this item could be quested for and Sony could set the quest level so that the item could be only available to high lvl necros, it would be no dreop (obviously) OR it could be a optional spell component that is expended at the summoning of a new pet, maybe even give it a downside like if its used u cant summon a pet higher than blue, ect...this is just a thought so ifi it sucks, sorry im only lvl 12 and an enchanter at that!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
