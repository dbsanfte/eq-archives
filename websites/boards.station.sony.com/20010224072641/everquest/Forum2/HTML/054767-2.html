This is because somewhere along the way or in-between, I buff strangers or go through many groupmates a session.<P>My simple outings could never truly pay for the cost of components and by armor, items, weapons, spells, etc., so I go to LGuk and get an FBSS or a nice Shardwurm Eye, from Great Divide, something within my level to attain, that I can sell in Gfaymart for 5-10k. Thats how you make money, not by expecting to loot a k or two in coin or gems.<P>Also, in response to a previous post... 25p for a rez is actually a laugh, 50%-96% of ones experience back, depending on level can save a lot of time. <BR>I've been given a kpp for a rez, but must say setting a price is cheesy.

</FONT><HR>I can understand making sure the cleric makes back the plat he/she spent buffing you up while you're grouped with them, and then their fare share after that.  But to hand them over all the extra jems just so they can afford to buff their guild on their next plane raid is just greedy on their part.<P>I don't care of you don't charge or accept donations for a rez.  That's not my fault if you don't.  Do clerics think I want to sit in places like Seb and get nothing to sell later?  Don't tell me that just the xp alone should keep me happy.  If that was the case then some of the clerics posting here wouldn't want more than to be reimbursed for the cost while grouped.  But instead some of them say they expect all gems so they can make extra plat.  <P>At a minimum, I always carry two stacks of paridots.  I use them to pay for rez when I or a groupmate needs one.  I give them to clerics in my group to help pay for buffs.  When my guild goes to on a plane raid and guest clerics are along with us, they get all the sellables split between them to help pay for buffs, and they also get equal chance on all randoms for their class.  If clerics are going to start demanding all the loot though, then I don't see why I should bother trying to be nice and helping them out when they are out to screw my chances of getting sellable loot.<P>No, not all clerics are like that.  But it seems (from playing and from reading here and other posts) that many clerics are getting greedier and greedier.  I guess it's a side-effect of Verant making them one of the "needed" classes in a group.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Tolch&gt; That's great, but you said yourself you carry Peridots.  You are a cleric's best friend.  I'm a level 54 cleric.  It has been ages since I topped 1K plat.  I spend money on Peridots faster than I take it in.  If it wasn't for my guildmates helping me buying Peridots I wouldn't have them at all.  <P>I help with Epic quests, whoops, 200 plat gone.  I help in Hate whoops, there goes another 500 plat.  I help with Chardok Royals oopsie, there goes another 500 plat.  We go viciously slaughter Kunark dragons another 200 plat down the drain.  Doing anything in Velious, doh there goes 1K plat.<P>Now we come to Sebilis.

Clerics deserve enough cash to pay for the symbols + 1/6 of the rest of the gems, and when it comes to paying the gems for hate/sky, it is the raid leader's responsability to make sure that you are compensated, not the people who group with you in sebilis.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is my take on all this.<BR>BLAH BLAH BLAH!<BR>I don't think clerics should get ALL the gems!<BR>Get real, it is a waste to sybol everyone unless you are taking on a raid or tough boss. I never charge for resses. True, peridots cost 12pp for me, but comeon, Everyone doesn't get a sybol constantly. I am an excellent healer that doesn't loose many people unless trained. The only time I would demand more loot, ie..gems, would be if the party is telling me they want symbols all the time. I reside on Fenin Ro and have only had 1 person tell me they wanted symbols all the time. But, occasionally I got a gem or too randomly looting regular mobs, so I was happy. Clerics are not to make money just because they keep you alive. I  love keeping people alive and hearing, "WOW you are a good cleric, you saved my a#$! Getting all the gems is plain greedy and shouldn't be tolerated.<BR>Oh well, <BR>Thanks for reading<BR>Selinie <BR>Fennin Ro<P>ps. anyone needing a res that is close by let me know because it is always free.

</FONT><HR>Ok, here's the take from another 53 cleric =)<P>In Seb?  I take all common gems.  Diamonds and stuff, those get randomed from the loot pile.  If there is an excessive amount of gems, I'll give some to the enchanter.  I usually do a double split of the pp/gp (I tend to be the ML), and hand out the non-stackables "sellables" to any that want'm.  I'd rather have a stack of gems than those bracelets -- easier to carry.<P>The average weekend day in Seb, I clear about 2k worth of sellables, costs me about 800pp to replace my peridots/jaspers and to pay the druids/wizards for a port to town.  <P>I made 1200pp you say?  How much do I make in KC?  In Chardok?  In Fear?  In Hate?  In Air?  Those are 4 zones where clerics go because we are needed...and there is NO cash to be had.  That's the reason why clerics are poor.  <P>I personally despise Seb, but I have to go there occasionally, to get the money so I can afford to go elsewhere.<P>Sellables go to clerics 1st, chanters 2nd...everybody else can fight over the coin (unless they are giving me stacks of peridots -- some do, and i'll give'm a pc or 2 of the non-stackable sellables if we are overflowing with'm at the end of the day).<P>On a side note, in the grps i've been in:  If all the melee's/casters have gotten armor type drops, the nice gems (diamonds, black sapph) will default as "enchanter loot" since they can turn it into jewelry worth what that tolan's, singing steel, jaundiced, donal's is worth.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Greedy clerics versus poor ones.  You do realize that there is a middle ground here...?<P>As a 55th level cleric, I have not once charged anyone for a rez.  However, I will usually accept unsolicited donations. Only when the person I'm rezzing is obviously not well off will I refuse offers.  I make sure that I respond to the "Donating for a rez" /oocs when I am able and have the time.  Sometimes I get 20 plat.. other times I get more than 100plat.  Either way, it is a viable source of income.<P>And to the folks who say "I would NEVER accept money for rezzes"... why not?   It's a high level spell that took someone a LOT of time and effort to achieve.  Enchanters are allowed to sell their jewelry at a profit.  Blacksmiths can sell their wares.  I look at it as my profession AND my trade skill.   You want my services?  That's fine.  I'll be more than happy to accept your donations!!   (Wizards and Druids port for anywhere from 10 plat to 20 plat per seat.  When they offer to port for free, I always donate 10 plat cash and use a Peridot symbol on them as a parting gift.)  <P>It's not a matter of "well, clerics should never charge for a ressurection" but rather one of economics.  You NEED the influx of cash to pay for the 10.5 plat peridots which keep people alive during combat.  (And as a footnote - look at all the computer D&D games and find ONE that didn't charge an exhorbitant amount of cash to resurrect your fallen groupmates.)  <P>The old adage "time = money" has no truer meaning than in Everquest.  You want to save time/experience-lost??  Then you might have to grease the wheels and offer to pay the nearby cleric for his services. <P>I almost never loot corpses during fights because I'm too busy medding.  As such, I rarely get the cash loot and almost never get the gem/item loot.  But at the end of the battle, I let my group know that I would like to have one low-end gem defaulted to me to help cover peridot costs.  Something like a fire opal or something is plenty.  I refuse too many because that would be unfair to the rest of the team.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Okay, Clerics do spend a lot on reagents.  -Fwen_ never said otherwise, nor has anyone except those who are jealous of how wealthy Clerics are (Ha!).  Enchanters spend money to play too.  How are they going to get their reagent expenses covered in a "need before greed" group?  They can't sell items that they win in lottos, they don't get to lotto.

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;Fact is Troller, gems are getting more and more wanted [especially for resist gear]. Diamonds especially. Blue diamonds even more. Other gems are also nice [black sapphires, etc.]. Handing them to clerics so they can sell them at a bazaar for 1-2k is more than covering for peridot cost.<BR>I think clerics should ask that all gems be lottoed. But they should ask for TRINKETS to cover peridot cost.&lt;&lt;<P>On one hand, Clerics have spent a ton on reagents over the course of their careers.<P>On the other hand, so have I.  90% of the time, if I have a symbol on, it's because I gave the Cleric more than enough gems for me--including Peridot.  (The other 10% of the time it's because I'm out of money/gems but the Cleric insisted, or because gems are paid for by raid funds.)  In fact, 90% of what I spend my money on is Peridot and Jasper.<P>I don't mind Clerics getting reimbursed, but I don't think handing them 2K in gems per session is the right thing to do either.  The practice of handing over gems goes back to when the most pricey gems outside of the Planes were worth under 100 plat and were uncommon drops; now we have 500 plat gems dropping, apparently more often than before.<P>KEEP the Clerics in enough gems to cover their costs, hand the Monks an extra pricey gem because they're not looting anything else (no coin, no FS, etc.), but be equitable with the rest of the group, too.  <P>Better yet, get the people of Norrath to start carrying their own damn reagents and keep the Clerics from going broke.  Then we can all lotto guilt- and controversy-free.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just my 2cp here:<P>I use about 350pp worth of Peridots and Jaspers on a 6 hour Hate raid, as an example.<P>Death Pact costs about 5pp per cast too...  it may rarely work, but I still use it, in hopes that "THIS" will be the time it finally saves whoever.<P>On Test (maybe on proddies too, dunno), Clerics are usually Group Lead and ML for the group.  As such, it's always good to have extra Weight reducing packs, and at 5250pp or more apiece, it can get expensive.  THIS DOES NOT mean that the regular groups should be funding all of the packs, but as a cleric, it can sure be helpful, since I tend to blow most of my spare coin on extra Peridots and Jaspers.<P>Should a Cleric walk away from a run with 2k in Gems?  Not unless everyone else is too.  I'd refuse to group with a Cleric that was getting it all.  But it's not unusual for Clerics to walk away with a small profit after a raid.  Some people give me gems without my even asking, many refuse to take "no thanks" as a reply.  But demanding all the Gems is NOT acceptable.

</FONT><HR>Seems like one of the main differences people aren't recognizing and therefore labeling clerics as "greedy" is the fact that there are HUGE differences between a "guild or friends" group then a pick up group.<P>I hunt almost exclusively with friends (some in other guilds, but close buddies) or my guildmates.  Most clerics I hunt with in multi-group raids (not all) symbol/Aego everyone who asks, whether it is their group or not.  Unless you are in Seb or PoG (PoG has good cash gem drops!) you WILL come up short unless people are handing you stacks of peridots.  When I go to an all weekend Air raid, I can go thru a whole 10slot backpack of peridots and pearls EASY.  I may be handed a stack or two, and maybe one or two sale gems, but trust me I come up WAY short.<BR>Same on Fear or Hate raids.<P>Then I get a Seb group with some buddies and make out like a bandit.  It all evens out, because I'm with people I hunt with a lot.<P>In a pick up group, I can see why people wouldn't want to be compensating a cleric for their losses in other zones since they had nothing to do with the other raids...and it isn't their responsibility to help you cover that loss.  It IS your guildmates/friends responsibility, however, IMO.<P>Far as charging for resses, most clerics I know don't charge, but will accept donations "sometimes".  I have spent hours hanging around Lfay/MM zone ressing people and chatting on /gu and not received a penny..just hanging out, meeting people and talking to friends. It's the "clericy" thing to do and I enjoy it.  Most of those people are lower level, and don't have lots of extra cash and I like helping...that is part of MY fun in the game, helping other people.  <P>Enough rambling, lol, just throwing out some cleric issues and thoughts from my own weird perspective. =P</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This sort of thing amazes me... <P>There is a huge difference in self buffs and full group buffs. If you want to split all gems down the middle, that is fine with me. I'll symbol myself, you can rune yourself, and we'll get along just fine. When you're casting rune on all six members of the party, replacing it when it's dispelled several times, then we'll talk.<P>I generally share the plat drops with my enchanters, wizards and mages to cover the costs of their reagants as well. But I'm casting at least six times the reagants as other casters, often times much more. I often burn through 700-1000p a day in reagants, some during regular hunting and some on raids. On a raid like Sky or a big dragon hunt, it isn't uncommon to burn through even more.<P>IF your cleric isn't symbolling, you have the right to complain... but I do hope you are giving stacks of peridots to the clerics you're grouping with in Karnors and Kedge and Fear and Sky and Chardok and all those other places where gem drops are much more precious. I doubt you are - but your clerics are still buffing you, just as they have been doing for many levels without compensation.<P>All I can say is thank Tunare for my guild and the fact that I don't have to deal with pickup groups... And if you have to rune yourself constantly, you are either doing a lousy job of crowd control or you choose really poorly in groupmates. I never have to rune myself as an enchanter except right before a big pull - and my enchanters don't when I'm their cleric.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think nitpicking over a few hundred plat expenditure is petty and uncool.<P>We all have our expenses. Having 1800 plat to spend on a bag full of peridots makes you a better and more desirable cleric.<P>Having 5k plat to spend on the latest and greatest flavor of the month weapon makes you a better and more desirable warrior.<P>Having 3k plat to spend to research all my pets makes me a better and more desirable mage.<P>We all have expenses, some greater than others. Obviously Clerics spend alot of cash just to operate, but that is simply the cost of playing a cleric. Casual looting even at my level easily negates the cost of spending 200 plat in peridots over a 4 hour period and that's not counting any goodies you might pick up and sell for a few hundred or thousand plat on the market.<P>If you find the expense of casting Symbol to be too great then don't cast it.<P>I'm like the biggest gimp in the game and even *I* don't think 2-300 plat a day in expenses is much.<P>Especially after 49, a rez is standard 50 plat donation (even if you dont require it, alot of people will pay.) Do 2 or 3 of those and you've recovered the cost of peridots for the next 4 hours and the looting you do becomes just more chump change to put in the bank.<P>If you start asking for extra money just to do your job, I'm gonna start asking for extra money to do mine, and the tank is gonna ask for extra money to do his. What, you think buying a new weapon every week is cheap???<P>I don't know if you know this but raising research skill costs me like 50 plat per point. Words cost me like 10-20 plat apiece and I need at least 10 of em to research all my pets, plus all the other components. What, you think I got all 4 pets for free??? In order to do my level 44 water pet I need to buy the level 34 pet spell, research 39, and then 44 and if I fail I have to do it all again, more money more components more words. I went through 1500 plat just to get my level 44 earth and air pets and I'm gonna be spending another 4k or so just to research my level 49 pets. And this is ALL pre-50 expenses, with pre-50 loot.<P>The point is I don't bother you with my problems. My expenses are my expenses. It's not your problem that I'm having trouble keeping up with the cost of being an effective mage. So what if I'm still wearing a Robe of the Elements and my INT jewelry sucks, as long as I have all the spells I need to be of utmost help to the group, I'm happy.<P>I could be like all the crappy mages that are wearing an SMR but they're walking around with like 1 pet and didn't bother to buy the "Summon Arrows" spell. But I forgo those luxuries to be a better Mage.<P>We all have expenses and Clerics have theirs. Deal with it. Don't burden me with a sob story about your outrageous expenses when I have my own outrageous expenses to deal with.<P>Yeah, so what you spend 200 plat on gems. I spent 800 plat on that earth pet that just saved our collective butts. Okay so you're spending 200 plat a day, but I'm not done with research and I need money too.<P>But no, clerics think they're the only people who have expenses. Like I said try being a warrior, it sucks. Always paying for ports, paying for rezzes, having no services to get donations from, having to upgrade weapons all the time just to keep up with the other warriors.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

This provides them weapon upgrades and an item to sell.<P>One time research expenses at 50 platinum per point come out to 250 platinum per level.  I think it safe to say that is about right compared to what a Cleric using even jaspers for Pinzarn goes through in the same level.  We eat those costs as there are no gem drops to speak of at those levels.  Gem drops don't start until Hate, Sebilis and Plane of Growth (Fear gem drops seem rare and disappear).  The problem is that the next gem is 10.5 platinum at the minimum cost.  Clerics have high expenses later on, Magicians don't seem to by comparison.  Enchanters have high expenses also.

</FONT><HR>The fact is groups need the best buffs available most times.  Past lvl 44 this means a cleric will blow a peridot for the symbols(til Naltron's Mark anyway).  This gets expensive fast.  If you think the cleric is getting too much loot then put some effort in getting the looting organized so it is more even.  Most pickup groups I'm in everything is so disorganized because they want to pull that next mob NOW.  So they go with the easiest loot system to reimburse the cleric for expenses.  Take some time to set something up to track loot so everyone gets a fair share.  Make sure that cleric, chanters, etc get that extra cut to cover costs.  Part of the problem with this game is the number of people playing it that have no concept of the value to a little pre-planning.  Pay attention to detail people and get these thing straightened out ahead of time.  Then when replacements come in make sure someone clues them in on what's going on with loot, mobs, etc.  It really bugs me having to play 20 questions to find out what is going on when I join a group.  I'm just glad I don't have to get pick up groups much anymore.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif"><P>Radcliffe Steelhammer<BR>Dwarven Cleric of the Pathfinders  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cool.gif"><BR>Cazic Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Obviously the poster was unaware of what use up means...they are gone, poof, no longer there.  I will give any warrior a great deal of sympathy if there 5000PP sword goes poof every raid.  Until then, they have a 5000PP weapon.  I will give other casters a lot of sympathy if they had to research the same spell every month but until then, they have the spell.  Clerics spend 100's of PP on buffs and it is gone for good.<P>This is on top of the expenses clerics have for spells (just paid 1500 for one) and armor and items....Whereas most melee types only have costs for armor and items and most other casters just spells and items.  Clerics do cost money to run.<P>On the other hand, I don't like charging for rezzes.  I have had a couple of nice donations, usually when I travel 6 zones to do one.  But I usually give away three rezzes for each one I get a donation...and that doesn't count guildmates, those are always free.<P>Now, in a typical 6 hour session, I will use up an average of 10 Peridots per group member (this assumes dispells).  That is 50 Peridots on people other than me.  I pay 13.5 PP per peridot in spite of my dwarven charm.  That is 675 PP for buffs on OTHER people.  Now to the pharmer who suggested not symboling everyone in your group, stick to your safe camps.  But in any sort of a good experience/loot camp for our groups, symbols are vital.<P>Now, along the way, I always symbol chanters...course I rarely get any runes in return...and you want to see taunt, watch what happens to me after a couple of CHeals.  I have problems getting chanters to even Rune the puller for a break.  And yes, I do expect them to pay for their own buffs, just like I expect myself to.<P>Now, it sounds like the initial poster had a gripe with one cleric...though my experience has been that chanters are more likely to be the cause of party deaths than clerics, it is possible to have losers in any class.  That does not have anything to do with the high cost of cleric buffs.  Instead of griping here, the initial poster should have offered some advice to the cleric and if they did not improve their performance...well, there is that gate button.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>All classes have costs to deal with.<P>When you've been dealing with research costs since level 16, it can no longer be called a "one time" expense.<P>At 250 plat per level, that's 1k plat just on the skill alone, without having research anything yet. Then you have the cost of words, the cost of the component, the cost of the spell scroll and you're spending like 60 plat per attempt. Say 4 attempts that's 240 plat. Multiply that by 4 spells that you're researching and you get roughly another k right there.<P>So basically we're talking a 2k expenditure at level 44, which at this level is a pretty substancial chunk of change. I've been spending money of this since level 16 at every spell circle. At level 16 it cost me 400 plat to get all my research spells. Do you have any idea how hard it is to scrap together 400 plat at level 16???<P>Someday I'll sit there are calculate prices at each spell circle just so I can stare at the bottom line and amaze myself with exactly how much money I've dumped into just spell research.<P>Nevermind that self-buff Phantom Plate costs a plat per shot. <P>As I said, expenses are expenses and I bear them alone as best I can. They are my problem and I don't expect or want anybody else to have to deal with them. They are simply the costs of playing my character.<P>I agree, using 11 plat regeants to buff a group is a pretty heavy cross to bear, despite the fact that you have a marketable skill that's in constant demand.<P>My income comes from what I loot. Like what am I ever going to get a donation for? Summoned arrows?<P>Yet I routinely see clerics rezzing people even in a group for profit. <P>So let me get this straight, you're getting a share of the corpses PLUS certain goodies set aside especially for you PLUS you're operating a virtual hospital at our campsite with people dragging corpses for you to res at 50 plat a body and you have the balls to say 200 plat even puts a dent in your wallet????<P>Jeez the nerve of some people. Already making money hand over fist, your only real expense being peridots and you actually complain about spending a crummy 200 plat in 4 hours???? 200 plat is 4 rezzes, and we have people dragging corpses in here every 10 or 15 minutes.<P>And don't give me any of that c0ck and bull about "I don't accept money for rezzes."<P>Every cleric on the board always says they dont accept money for rezzes yet go to any zone in the game and see if you can find a cleric that doesn't require a "donation."<P>Every druid on the board always says they don't charge for ports yet go to any zone in the game and find me one druid who is willing to port you to DL for less than 20 plat.<P>In like 2 years of playing and getting a port or two a day for most of it, I've met like 3 druids who have ever ported me "just for the hell of it."<P>In like 2 years of playing I've gotten maybe 40 or 50 rezzes total and I've had to pay for almost all of them.<P>The reality is that even if a cleric is sitting right there at the zone waiting for a group, 90 percent of the time she won't rez you without promise of compensation.<P>I'm not talking about your corpse being in another zone or even across the dungeon. I'm talking about my corpse was right there at her feet.<P>Me : "Scuse me can I bother you for a res? My corpse is in front of you."<P>Reply : "How much money with u give me?"<P>I was just so disgusted I looted my corpse and logged for the night.<P>I have NEVER charged for ANYTHING that my mage can do. Not for summoning anything, not for showing someone the way from point A to point B, not for invising and getting someone's corpse, never.<P>As I said my sole income is from looting dead mob corpses. If you take that away from me in the name of "I need it to buy peridots" then what income am I left with????<P>What am I supposed to do, solo Hill Giants on my own time for cash and then get a group for exp with all the cash being handed over to the nearest cleric????<P>That's exactly what I asked a cleric the other day when she became too greedy. I was like "This is my sole means of making money. There are no services that I charge for, my aid is completely free. If we're handing over all the loot to you then what am I left with?"<P>She didn't say anything so I disbanded and gated.<P>I can be your friend, I will stay and die with you, I can summon anything you need, I'll stick around for hours to help everyone get their corpse if need be.<P>Yet when I ask you for a rez the response is "Time is money?" Then what about everybody else's time? Why isn't their time worth money? Why don't we feed warriors for tanking to finance their next big armor purchase? Why don't we feed the enchanters for mezzing to finance their next big spell purchase?<P>I don't know what it is with the new batch of twinky clerics coming out these days. They're in demand and they know it so they become greedy and pump you for all you've got because they can. Like what are you gonna do, try to find another cleric???<P>It's real simple. Clerics have everyone else by the balls. Nobody else wields the sort of power over a group that a cleric does. Their word is law, you either give them extra money or they go elsewhere and the rest of the group is SOL. Piss one off and you're never getting a rez. And when they do sell you a rez for 50 plat they act like you owe them a favor.<P>But on the boards it's "NERF THE DRUIDS THEY'RE TOO POWERFUL." Heh. That's real power guys, the power over life and death. No cleric, no group.<P>I think the healing power of all the other classes needs to be increased, and the other 2 main healing classes should both get rez, just to break the monopoly. This is just too much power for one single class to have.<P>As you can see from the original poster they're milking that power for everything they can get.<P>Fiz.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A couple responses in one here...<P>First off, I go through 1000pp of dots in about 2 weeks, give or take.  I am lucky enough to have enough wisdom on my trunk (head slots, neck, bp, legs, and boots) and on my click stick, that I can afford to wear +cha items on my arms, wrists, and fingers.  I have 201 wis, and 107 cha.  That's enough to pay the lowest price for dots (10.5) and get the best price for selling gems and trinkets.<P>So, it *is* possible to have high charisma as a dwarven cleric... it just takes some work.  (:<P>That said, here are the selling prices for some average gems that was awarded in Sebilis:<P>ruby: 147pp<BR>star ruby: 62pp<BR>saphire: 98pp<BR>emerald: 12pp<BR>fire opal: 47pp (or 55pp if you sell to an enchanter)<BR>black pearl: 19pp (or 25pp if you sell to an enchanter)<BR>and trinkets range from 47pp (for mith amulet) to 150ish for (ruby crown.)<P>I've only done one real hunting trip in Sebilis, and I came out with 600pp worth of gems/trinkets, and had spent about 300pp worth of dots.  the other 300?  Went to fund more dots for places that aren't as kind to clerics...<P>Also, if you hunt in PoG, make sure the cleric is looting.  Mobs there drop up to 16pp each.  If your group kills 4 mobs per hour (not counting prots, of course), you can make up the cost of dots spent.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My peridot costs always come out of group/raid profit. If they don't, I don't enter groups with that leader anymore. At the same time, I have a responsibility not to waste these expensive symbols on people who won't be getting hit. Tanks, always; enchanters, always; monks/druids/shamans/secondary tanks, sometimes; wiz/nec/mage, never. This stuff adds up quick even to an OS group. Still, 200pp in gems when the group has made 1200pp + some nice items is a fair tradeoff. Enchanters in my groups generally don't need to rune if they are disciplined, but if they do, they get reimbursed too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"I'll tell you this. Once I went on a Plane of Sky raid, was there for a few days, NO GEMS DROPED<P>I burned 4 stacks of peridots maybe 5 I cant remember.<P>Now here I am, say 5 stacks of peridots short and nothing to sell to make that money back.<P>You know, I dont really care, because I'll go somewhere that drops gems and make that plat up.<P>So who is to say that Cleric has never spent a weekend raiding in cost of say 2k on peridots.<P>There isnt alot of tanks or anyone willing to donate money to Clerics, sure there is some but not very many.<P>As for the Chanter useing peridots, How often to you cast Rune on EVERYONE in your group? Im not doubting you have done it at some point but Im sure you dont do it every time."<P>1) I don't give a rat's arse wot a cleric in a typical hunting group did when I wasn't there to receive the benefits.  This means your 2kpp expenditure on a raid is meaningless to me, unless I also was on the raid.  Even if I were on the raid, I would not expect any other member of the current group to care, and thus to support the cleric's buffing habits.<P>2) Rarely does a cleric use his Naltron Symbol on me (a wizard).  And yet here I sit using Peridot after Peridot to keep Manaskin up when I have to take up the chanter's slack, or when the MOB gets uberpissed because I snared it at 70% health, etc.  Why shouldn't I be compensated somewhat?  I guarantee that last night I used more Peridots than the cleric with me--but I won't see a single gem in recompense until I press the issue.<P>3)  A cleric buffing every member of the group only has to use one peridot every 54 minutes per peson.  That's six peridots an hour, with six extra tacked on at the end of a session to account for the missing six minutes (e.g. a four hour session would cost 30 peridots).  Add in a dispel here and there, and increase the number of peridots by one per tank per hour (e.g, in a three tank group, that's an extra 3 peridots per hour).  After four hours, with three tanks, that's only 42 peridots, or about 450pp.  The vendor prices for money items ranges from 36pp to over 80pp, in my experience.  That means roughly 10 gems have to drop to cover the cleric's expenses.  This doesn't count coin loot--which in a four hour session usually results in about 60pp per person on a split.  I have yet to see less than three to four gems drop per HOUR.  On a bad night, 10 money items for a four hour period is typical.  *We haven't even got to the stat item loots yet!*<P>How can clerics justify this "horde the gems" policy?  I have one word to say to 'em:  PFFFFT.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>LMAO.<P>Greedy clerics? We are the ones spending all our money and our mana on you. Most groups I've been in hand over the gems without question. Not a word. Recently I grouped with two people who didn't hand me gems. I mentioned it in tells to other groupmates, the consensus was we wouldn't group with them again.<P>If you "had" to rune everyone in the group, I'd understand.<P>But the post-50 game costs a lot of peridots. And those losses aren't always recouped. So if we come out ahead, BIG DEAL. Because we sure as heck aren't going to always come out ahead. Just because one cleric had a lucky day, don't let that make you think that we're all greedy loot wh0res. We're not. Our money... goes directly... into YOUR SAFETY. Do I need to repeat that?<P>However, Diamonds/etc (the super-rare, non-buyable drop-only gems) should be randomed.

</FONT><HR>Hey, Apollo, did you figure in the fact that the Enchanter/Wizard/Necro peridot damage shield is "dispelled" every time they are aggroed?  And yes, even with aggro-control (Concussion for wizzies/stuns for wizzies/enchanters/root and such for all three), sometimes the mob just has to kill the caster no matter what.  This seems to happen more frequently the higher level the mob.<P>I can go through an entire stack of peridots an hour by myself if the enchanter is crappy and I have to help crowd control, for example.<P>Some clerics don't seem to understand that other classes have buffs that are just as expensive as theirs.<P>Moreover, if you'll notice, I was even more generous, and figured the number of peridots at 42 in a four hour period.<P>Clerics deserve to be compensated for their symbol spells.  They don't deserve to be given such special consideration "just because."  The rest of us have plat sinks, too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I keep trying to tell you guys, EVERYBODY HAS A MONEY SINK, it's just that with some classes it's more subtle.<P>With clerics it's blunt, 11-13 plat a pop for peridots. Yeah, I know it's hard to keep up on the Peridot payments but I can assure you it's hard for everybody!!!<P>Hell I don't even have a service to make money on.<P>But everybody else has their money sinks too. Like I mentioned before a warrior *IS HIS EQUIPMENT*<P>While they don't lose a 5k sword in each and every raid, equipment is expensive. Bandages, arrows, pumices, chipped bone rods, sow potions, shrink potions, IU potions, invis potions, gate potions, ports, rezzes, sows. The list goes on and on and on. A warrior can do NOTHING for himself. Every convenience in the game costs MONEY and the only way they make money is what they LOOT.<P>If you sit there and demand every precious gem, they have no choice. Warriors are a dime a dozen, and the cleric is necessary. If he says he wants all the gems, he gets all the gems.<P>But what you don't realize is that warrior is going to have to login his necro and farm money just to keep up with expenses because he has so many of them.<P>Everybody has expenses but the cleric's expenses come down to one single gem. For a warrior it's a hundred different goods and services that he needs to buy just to get from point A to point B.<P>Same with me, mages have no way of making money except what they LOOT. If you take even that away from me then I have no way of meeting my expenses other than to farm loot which I *really* hate doing.<P>You spend more but you make more. I spend less but I make less.  The gripe is that some clerics like to put their thumb on the scale and pretend to be dirt poor when in reality they're making more money than everybody else combined just based on Rez donations, not even taking account the share of the loot.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
