</FONT><HR>I agree completely with Bogmog.<P>Since the release of Kunark, EQ has had a paradigm shift away from regular gamers to those of "Uber Guilds".<P>Basically, since then, if you not part of an uberguild, you can probably forget about ever seeing any alter-planes or quite possibly even killing Vox and Naggy, let along more than 75% of Velious or any of the good Kunark dungeons.<P>I haven't been spending my $10 to just explore the old world and see the same places I've seen before.<P>I am not part of an uberguild.  And quite honestly if I was asked on my server, Veeshan, to join an uberguild I would probably tell them to go jump off Queynos Pier.  I have no stomach for their lame attitudes.<P>It's not fair that because I'm not such a person that most of the interesting content will be basically unseen by me.<P>EQ needs to be re-vamped and the majority of the content, both old and new, needs to have a new median.  <P>Yes, for those of that ilk there should be places for them.  I have no desire to deny anyone of what they earn.  But for the majority of the new content to be only ultra-high level enounters that require 40+ people to do is wrong.  <P>I want to see Hate, Fear, Growth....I want to be able to take down Vox, Trax, Ventil....I want to have my say in the politics of Velious.<P>Why should I, a casual gamer and not a member of the "uberguilds" be denied such?<P><BR>Taliseian Khalreshaar<BR>&lt;Storm of Blades&gt;<BR>Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This was a great post.<P>EVERQUEST is VERANTS games.. and they will do with it what they will... but I would *really* hope they start balancing it towards the ordinary player and 5-6 people groups instead of this mud-inflationary trend they have been on for a long time.<P>That said, personally, I dont expect Verant to change, and am considering when I will depart this initially very fun game, but over time, more and more frustrating and not as fun game due specifically to the mud-inflation issues :-(<P>--Mordsith<BR>59 Defiler<BR>19 Warrior</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First off GREAT post. Secondly would it be possible for VI to restrict the ammount of times that a person can kill a "Named" mob?? I mean after they have killed it like say 5 times they no longer see the mob the mob no longer sees them? I think that maybe it could help the situation a little definatly a fix.

</FONT><HR>This game is about four things-<P>1) Having fun with your on-line friends.<BR>2) Exploring new areas<BR>3) Gaining levels<BR>4) phat lewts<P>#1- I can chat with my friends anytime, but a group of us can't just go out and make good headway in a new dungeon without a hoarde.  Hoardes are fun, but you can't always find one. Have you seen some of the level requirements for different classes in the "uberguilds"? Typically you see this:<BR>Warrior- 52 and above<BR>Enchanter- 50 and above<BR>Cleric- 50 and above<BR>Rogue- 55 and above<BR>Druid- 61<BR>Paladin- 61... yes, I KNOW there is no level 61, but that is what I saw as a level requirement for one guild.  They know what classes are needed for raids, and which are optional, and which just aren't necessary.  In Velious, you are either outdoors, or in a raid.  So, I get to run around outside alot, but I haven't set foot farther than the first corner of a Velious dungeon that I would get exp in- and I have had Velious since the day it came out.<P>#2- Exploration- see above  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> If I can't get a group, a BIG one- like *3* groups, I don't stand a chance of seeing Siren's Grotto, or the Western Wastes.  Exploring is a huge part of this game for me, and Velious is basically locked to me because I am not in a huge powerful guild.<P>#3- Gaining levels- again  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> refer to number 1- can't get a group, can't get much exp except by soloing- I didn't think that fit The Vision(tm) anyway.  I chose the bard class to play because I wanted to group.<P>#4- phat lewts- I am by no means greedy, but in order to play a more effective role in a group, you need better armor/weapons/accessories (i.e. belts, jewelry etc.) so you aren't either dead or the group mana-sponge. So, once again, refer to number 1- no group, no lewts.<P>You can say that if I were a better player, a nicer person, or whatever else wasn't wrong with me, I could get a group, but this isn't the case.  I am known as being nice, and as playing a bard very well among those who do know me.  What bothers me is that when I bought the players guide to EQ, a note somewhere said something to the effect that you get out of this game what you put in.  Well, to become a level 52 bard, I sure as heck have put in- but without a BUNCH of other people who have put in, I am now stuck.  A pity too, because I really like this game, but I have to play another class (cleric) so that I can see those places that are off limits to the bard, because a cleric will be sucked up in a heartbeat.<P>Anyway, I have meandered a goodly bit- but I would reiterate.  Yes, Verant has lost touch with the player BASE... they are now orbiting the APEX players and leaving the rest of us with an expansion we can't really utilize.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>Laurelai Lifelyric<BR>52 bard- stuck outside looking in</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Great Post, I agree.<P>Look at the goals in EQ.  <P>other than levleing and items there are none.<P>Caracter development isn't there.  Now they place these goals out of reach of 95% of their customers.<P>How many of you would say spend the 4 + years needed to get a good degree if only the top 5% had a chance of getting a job that required that degree.<P>EQ has become much more of a fantasy Job, and much less of a game because of this.  <P>I know the hardcore say that "its not worth is in its not hard" and " you expect to make level 60 in a week"  etc.. etc..  <P>Other than spending midless hours tell me whats hard?   Are there any difficult puzzles to solve?  Is there any real dynamic there.  (Thing changes by themselves over time) <P>The term camping shows a lot of the problems with EQ.  in EQ without a uber guild Eploration = Death.<P>Sadly I think the solutions to this are beyond what VI is willing to spend to take EQ from a good game to a great game.<P>One thing that can be chaged for the better in the current EQ, and it will take a lot of work.  Is a changing world.  Over time the world itself changes.  Cities get ransacked and move.  Small changes that over months add up.  That would help the average player in that its not alway the same place.<P>After almost 2 years play I can still find that one guy I camped at level 8 almost 18 months ago.  You'd think the guy would be smart enough to get some friend, or move...  <P><BR>As to the attainment of the "uber" and Epic loot.  Those are endgame.  every player should have a resonable chance.  If not then the game is not designed correctly.  for when all and said and done about any game.  what the player remebers is the endgame, or lack thereof.....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>All I can say is I am outraged that so much of Velious has been barred to me because I prefer the traditional 6 man group and generally lack the time for raids. <P>Sure have raid only zones - but the sheer quantity of them in Velious is ridiculous. I never thought I would agree with the statement that Verant has lost touch with the playerbase, but now...<P>Over half of Velious is barred to me because of this. Whats even more frustrating is that you can take incredible risks and travel through Kael, Wakening Land etc and find no group at the end. They really need to enable high post50 players means of instant transportation to far flung places that does not depend on other classes. IF I only have three hours and spend 1.5 travelling I usually just log. Even the few post 50 raid dungeons require a minimum time committment.<P>Furthermore I hear that Sirens Grotto is the only way to the western wastes and is incredibley dangerous and buggy. What an ill-thought out design.<P>Basically they are not permitting me to consume content that I paid for.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Excellent post Bogmog, and many other great posts in this thread.<P>I just wanted to bump and add my two bits- that I was overjoyed to finally see someone put so eloquently into words what I have been feeling and what finally caused me to loose my addiction for EQ. <P>Velious and the way it was tuned just killed my desire to continue trying to 'keep up with the Joneses'. I got tired of lusting after equipment that knew I would never get since I loathe the multi-group (4+) raids they require.

</FONT><HR>I have to say that Bogmog's original thread is one of the reasons that I discovered long ago that I would never attain, or much less desire to play the high level game...<P>I am well aware of mudflation, and when I entered the EQ realm just before Kunark had just been released, I knew that this was already occuring with the same guild clearing the Planes/dragons over and over. I also saw with this increase of max levels from 50-60 that Verant would need to make the "high level game" based on guild raids instead of 6 man groups. <P>It becomes more and more apparent that I will not ever have uber items for my characters, and that the same 50+ people will just get them over and over again ( to give them to one of their alts or sell them to someone else's alt who has tons of pp to spare)... I have a number of online friends from all different guilds, but I play so erratically and for short periods at a time that I probably will never be on a raid or be 'uber' guild material.  <P>That's why I'm totally happy running around in my crappy gear, having a jolly old time rumaging through them 'uber' people's pockets....  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is definitely something that should be addressed by the game designers. It's not only gear that makes the difference, it's also the sheer numbers of people needed. <P>A powerful, well-balanced level 55 group decked out in planar gear cannot experience no less than 6 entire zones - Siren's Grotto, Western Wastes, Dragon Necropolis, Temple of Veeshan, and the 2 Planes, nor major parts of Icewell Keep and Kael. They could not even reach the zone line to four of those zones. This accounts for over 43% of the entire expansion product.<P>In Kunark there is 1 zone like this (Veeshan's Peak) and only a half a dozen other encounters, 4 of which are dragons.<P>In the basic game that same group at level 50, without planar gear, was only restricted from 2 zones (Hate and Fear) and 2 dragons. The Hole, added later, has one more encounter of this type.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Brad himself has also said that new content will be forthcoming, and that it will be more or less aimed at everyone, not just the high end of the game.<P>yada yada yada.<P>It is no secret that EQ is tuned/tweaked/added to/ almost exclusively for the high levels, and the elite few in particular. I for one, amd sick of all the rhetoric.<P>Talk is cheap, back up that talk by doing something for everyone...and not just say it is either, make it so it *really* is for everyone. Kunark, for all its hype, is still mainly a highbie playground. And then only for high levels that have a higher end PC.<P>Bah, the day this game is run for the average schmoe, will be the day that players leave for greener pastures, not before.<P>Like I said, all the talk from VI says otherwise, but I want to see some action to go with the talk, not just a bunch of cheap rhetoric.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>tvaddict,<P>We were discussing this at length ( a friend and I ), and we came to the conclusion that a viable economy might not be possible in a game unless it is the only economy in the game.<P>What I found with UO is lots of people making bread, swords, etc, that you could just go and buy from an npc vendor anyway... cheaper.<P>Spell reagents hoarded so that none were available then resold at rediculously mudflated prices. <P>And it got so you could never buy a house -unless- you happened to either get it when placement was up, had a ridiculous amount of uo money, or had a ridiculous amount of RL E-bay money to waste.<P>Now, UO demonstrated people were prepared to be farmers, smiths etc. But the majority of people sold their fruits to npc`s. PC`s could get them cheaper from the infinatley stocked (stocked by the server) npc`s anyway.<P>But if the npc`s -only- stocked the food the farmers provided them, and the weapons the smithies made, well now that would have been a very nice and unique thing <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>As it is UO`s trade skills are just as meaningless as EQ`s. Especially now pvp has been relegated to one facet in UO. Before the odd pc purchase of trade-made goods happened just because some were too scared to go into town <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Anyway an eq shammie can make a sow potion. Sow is the most overpowered spell in the game IMO. Sow (pun) i`d go for eq alchemy anyday.<P>Oh and did you -ever- get any npc say anything interesting ever in UO apart from `I dont understand thee...?`<P>I`m not arguing that eq is unequivocably better, or that you`re wrong, just that a viable economy system has yet to be implemented in any of the current crop.<P>Oops longer than expected.<P>/em Sorry <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

It's simple if your not in an uber guild you go to zone a b and c where  single groups fight and you get xp and whats now called "crap loot" lemme tell you my group in solb killed the stone spider today and it droped a BCP I was verry excited so i told my sis and she say "bah thats crap loot, ppl give those away to druids as port fair" and my heart sank.....they really gotta do something about the economy and try to re-evaluate the non uber game. <P>It's almost sad when i think about the fact that between lv 12-40 i hadnt really "earned" any of my equipment....i just bought it, and now that i know where some of it came from i wonder *** is up with this.....atleast velious has some items a lv 40 can get and actually wants to use instead of sell because its only lv 20 gear.<P>oh well they've got to do something to the game.<P>and BUMP!<P>(BTW when are they gonna fix the ceremonal wedding sword?? and YES Ester DID say it was bugged)sorry im desprate to get that thing fixed or atleast an explenation how Ester can go from " i talked to the designer and its definitly bugged, I'm very sorry it will be fixed." to "hmm i don think that item is sapose to be used"<P>anyway sorry bout that =P</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Great post!<P>--"Part of the problem is that this game inherently requires zero skill. Items and levels win. "--<P>To me this is the crux of the problem. In a game where a characters ability is more defined by his gear than his skills is going to suffer Mudflation big time.<P>Level focus is not normally too much of a problem in most games like this, but in EQ it is starkly amplified. In games such as Meridian59 the power to level curve was logarithmic. ie. the more levels you gained the less difference in power. e.g. The power difference  between a lvl 25 and 30 is more than the power difference between a lvl 50 and lvl 60. This means the 10 hours a night guy is more powerful than the 2 hours a night guy, but not in a manner that warps the game making it unplayable for the 2 hour a nigh guy.<P>EQ is the total opposite of this. Power to level curve is exponential. Your 10 hour a nighters make the game almost unplayable to anyone with less than 4 hours a night to throw away.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I love this thread.<P>Of the 300,000+ subscribers that Verant is so proud of having, I wonder how many will ever get a chance to even roll on an item from Trakanon or even Venril Sathir?  How many will get a chance to even START their epic quests?  For that matter, how many will even get a chance to goto a plane?<P>The funny thing is, it's even not a question of level, and to me thats the really sick part.  Sure, there will be people who will go guildless because they don't have the time to devote, or they have a bad reputation and have screwed themselves socially on their server or they just never got on board early enough.  That, to me is understandable.  But there are people who are avid EQ players since release, have solid reputations, and are GOOD players, but because of the class they chose to play, are simply no t welcome on many post-50 raids.  Hypothetically, if you started playing EQ the first week it released in '99 and got in a guild early-on that is now an "uberguild" BUT you have only played one character, and that character is a Paladin or Shadow Knight, you are pretty much left out in the cold in the post-50 game.  And THAT is the tragedy of EQ.  Being left behind because of how you play is one thing, but being left behind because of the design of your class, is simply WRONG.<P>AL</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Kheldan,<P>Respectfully I disagree with you about the economics of UO.  Don't get me wrong, there were *LOTS* of problems with UO.  The first few months in UO there were more bugs than EQ has had in its entire existence.  But I'm talking about economics and mudflation here.<P>Economies rely on buying cheaper products over and over again and larger products infrequently.  UO did well with this.  Reagents, armor, and weaponry were disposable (since dieing was not that big of a deal) and land/houses were extremely valuable.  People could use trade skills to support constant demand for armors, potions and etc.  That's why I would never mind personally mining for hours.  I knew there was a market for ingots.  Is there a market for items produced by trade skills in EQ?  The only way demand is going to raise is to make the cost lower and the utility greater.  Otherwise, trade skills are just a feature nobody will use.  Yes it was silly to buy black pearl off player vendors at 20gp each.  But if it’s there and you have the money, that’s the trade off.  I think the availability of reagents at npc shops was just about right.  There is one potion, which has a market in EQ and that’s sow.  Compare that to the utility of healing potions and exploding potions in UO.  If you played the game for a long time, you’d realize how central these things were to combat. <P>When you have such a small supply of goods and so few players, who can afford the prices created by such a small supply, you can’t have a dynamic market.
