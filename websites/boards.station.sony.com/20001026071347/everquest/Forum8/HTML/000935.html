&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Forged Throwing Weapons<P>When I saw there was going to be new forgable throwing weapons, I had a brief flash of hope.  Finally maybe there would be a semi-decent throwing weapon available. Unfortunately, those hopes were crushed after I saw the new stats.  I'm sorry to tell you, but these new weapons aren't worth it.  Lets compare a few examples:<P> 			Dmg	Dly	Wt	Rng	Cost(cp)	      Stack of 20(cp)<BR>Throwing Knife		5	36	.5	45	     11		220	       <BR>Forged Throwing Knife	5	35	.5	60	  ~107		~2100<BR>Shuriken			4	26	.5	60	     11		220<BR>Forged Shuriken		4	25	.5	65	  ~107		~2100<BR>Throwing Axe		6	30	1	120	     34		272 (nonstackable, 1 Backpack full)<BR>Forged Throwing Axe	6	29	1	55	  ~1070		~8500 (nonstackable, 1 Backpack full)<BR>Forged Javelin		7	33	2	205	  ~1070		~8500 (nonstackable, 1 Backpack full)<P>Compared to Fletching<P> 			Dmg	Dly	Wt	Rng	Cost(cp)	     Stack of 20(cp)<BR>Hunting Bow		5	43	3.5	50				(MOB drop)<BR>Rough Hickory, Hemp	10	50	4	50	   268			(purchase for 1pp or less)<BR>Carved Elm, Silk String	10	39	4	75	   5157			(purchase for 8-12 pp)<BR>Trueshot		20	45		100	200000			(Quest or purchase, Ranger only)<P>Class 1 Wood Point	1			50	5		100 (Field pt, wood shaft, round fletch, large nock)<BR>Class 2 Wood Point	1			150	20		400 (Buy from players 1pp/stack)<P>As you can see, the only reason to use throwing instead of archery is for roleplay reasons (Unless you are a Bard or caster with no choice)  I have also excluded throwing boulders as they drop off of giants and are only usable by large races.  At present, my critical hits with throwing knives do 17 damage, less than the base for a Trueshot or other higher level bow.  Now I don't expect throwing weapons damage to equal archery (though it would be nice), but I don't think it is too much to ask to have a couple of decent throwing weapons available.  The changes I would request are as follows:<P>First, your costs on existing smithable thrown weapons are too high by a factor of 10.<BR>Second, non-stackable throwing weapons are a complete waste of time and computer space, make throwing axes and javelins stackable.<BR>Third, there needs to be at some changes made in the smithable throwing weapons.  I would suggest the following:  <P> 			Dmg	Dly	Wt	Rng	Cost(cp)	      Stack of 20(cp)<BR>Forged Shuriken		4	25	.5	65	  ~10		~210<BR>Forged Throwing Knife	6	32	.5	100	  ~20		~400 (Buy from players 1pp/stack)<BR>Forged Throwing Axe	12	60	1	75	  ~60		~1200 (Buy from players 3pp/stack)<BR>Forged Javelin		8	40	2	205	  ~60		~1200 (Buy from players 3pp/stack)<P>This would provide basic throwing weapons, as well as 2 upgrades, and an additional higher damage, short-range option at a price players would actually pay.  These changes would not have a big impact on gameplay since throwing and archery are only useful for pulling, but it would provide another option, particularly for rogues like myself that prefer throwing weapons.  It would also create a few forged weapons that are marketable, unlike the existing forged weapons whose fine steel counterparts are cheap and readily available.  If these would become trivial in the 75-100 range,  they would make a nice stepping stone to banded as well.  Anyway, these are my thoughts on the subject.  Comments, anyone?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>It's absolutely nuts.  First of all, everything but throwing boulders should stack.  Secondly, the prices are indeed to high by a factor of ten.  Who the hell is going to pay 2 plat for a 7 damage non stacking, one use javelin?

</FONT><HR>What Shiara said. The price of a "fire and forget" weapon should be considerably lower than it is. If there was a way to make a batch of imbued throwing weapons,THEN I could see the expense...then again,I think the same way about fletching. It shouldn't cost many times over the loot you get from a monster to have a chance to pepper it to death at range. Or even hit it decently to pull it. As it is,I don't even bother with bows-I use a spell to pull instead.<BR> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Grimnar <P>I agree with your overall assessment, but I'm curious why your suggestion for Forged Throwing Knifes would improve them past Forged Shurikens?<P>Many of my stable, Rouge or not, prefer Shuriken for pulling and finishing off runners as well.  We're not masters of reverse star kiting, but given the opportunity with SoW or just against a slower Undead, getting in several shots before engaging helps.  Archers often use same technique.<P>The formula, as it was, TK's would do 5 damage, while a trade-off of having a shorter distance and higher delay.<P>Forged Shuriken 4 25 .5 65 <BR>Forged Throwing Knife 6 32 .5 100 <P>You have increased both damage and distance,  lowering delay while ignoring any similar adjustments to the Forged Shuriken from what they are.  Let's say for mechanics reasoning that your enhancement were adopted. Then why choose the Shuriken, just for a 7 sec less delay?<P>An additional observation, that while fTK had their distance increased by 15, the stars only by 5!<P>Perhaps along the line of:<BR>Forged Throwing Knife 6 35 .5 60<BR>Forged Shuriken 5 25 .5 75  <P>Boost both damages and match range improvements.<BR>I know it wouldn't compensate for the higher material costs, but it may make them slightly more desired based on the smithing effort.<P>I was able to smith a Skinning Knife for downgrading pelts at skill (12).  Something tells me those molds selling for under a gold each, probably also have a lower trivial point.<P>While I do have your attention, I have been curious about throwing multiples.  I haven't<BR>noticed more hits if I stack 2 or more stars (or knifes).  Obviously ammo is just wasted if only one ever hits.  (Or at least checked).<P>EverFaithful</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>ClericTaven:<P>I simply adopted the existing stats of the current forged shuriken, using it as a baseline for step-style improvements for the other weapons.  That being said, I agree with your revisions of distance.  100 would be too long for them to accept for fTK and 60 rng on a base 6 dmg would be more reasonable.  However, base damage on a forged shuriken should remain at 4.  Otherwise there is no significant reason to choose fTK over shuriken (+1 dmg at cost of +10 dly -15 rng vs. +2 dmg others same)  The idea would be to create some difference in the weapons to give people enough reason to choose one or the other.  I would recommend lowering forged shuriken weight to 0.1, which would make them popular with monks.  Now if we could find someone at Verrant who is interested in our opinions. 8)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I've been trying to get feedback from Verant on this issue for months in various forums.<P>Rogues are the masters of the throwing skill, right?  Then why do we all run around carrying big clumsy bows and arrows like a ranger? Because the current throwing weapons SUCK!  Throwing axes and spears have very nice stats, but they are not stackable, makeing them virtually USELESS!  We can fletch magical arrows now, why not throwing weapons?  I was very dissapointed when I saw the stats on the new forged throwing weapons, a slight improvement indeed, but far from satisfying.<P>Is something like this too much to ask for?<P>Forged Throwing Dirks (or Daggers/Stilletos, whatever)<BR>MAGIC STACKABLE<BR>Damage 7 Delay 40 Range 75<BR>Usable by all classes with the throwing skill<P>I don't care how much they cost to make or if they have a 200 trivial smithing skill, just put the molds for them in game in any town with a forge.  Make them decently accessible for all races.  IMO trivial smithing skill shout be 175 and cost per stack of 20 should be ~5pp per stack.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Oh, and another thing.  Fix the minimum range on all throwing weapons.  If you are out of range to melee attack, there is no reason that your target should be "You are too close to use a ranged attack".  Gah, that really annoy's me.  Being on a PvP server, I can't tell you how many times I've just been rooted, and then the caster steps back a couple paces to get just out of melee range, and too close for a ranged attack, then just starts nuking away on my helpless melee only behind.  In my opinion, this is an exploitable bug in game coding and mechanics.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>As it is right now, the game is in favor of barbarian rogues in many instances.  They have the ability to bash, making them the only rogues who can interrupt a mobs cast other than a lucky backstab.  Then to add insult to injury, they can use throwing boulders.  I think throwing boulders are a great idea since barbarian rogues, are, naturally a larger race.  I am not saying nerf barbarians, I do have a point  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Why not make something for the smaller rogues, we are quick, cunning, why not something like throwing boulders for us?  randomly drops off some semi big mobs, like krups in sebilis, or something (don't feel it should be something like juggernauts, because throwing boulders come from pre 50 places).<P>Froglok Bone knife<BR>15dmg 40delay range 100<BR>rog war shd<BR>hfl def gnm dwf hum hef eru<P>stackable of course, and not wieldable in the hands of course.<P>Just an idea.

As it is now, barbarian rogues have str advantage, bash advantage, and being able to use throwing boulders.  I ask you, why play a small race?

</FONT><HR>Two things that I think would balance out throwing are:<P>1.  Some returning throwing weapons.  Things like boomerangs or chakrams that come back to your hand after use.  Maybe have a boomerang that can be made with fletching, with stats like a shuriken but with twice the delay(to reflect the return time) and then add a couple very nice magical returning weapons as drops in Velious or something.<P>2.  A duel throw skill.  Just like duel wield, where you can use a throwing weapon in each hand.  You put your mainhand stack of throwing weapons in your range slot, and your offhand stack in the ammo slot.  Two fisted knife throwing would be great.  Even if you doubled the damage output (which it wouldn't, cause max duel wield only lets offhand strike about half the time, assume the case would be the same here) of throwing by this, it still wouldn't match up to archery, so it's hardly unbalancing.<P>Oh, and halfing knives sold in Rivervale WOULD be handy.  They should make em so Barbs can't use em though.  To balance out them throwing boulders.<P>-Ender</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I really have to agree, the cost of the forged throwing weapons is really out of line.  I made a few of the ranged just for fun, but after looking at how much I'd have to sell them for to break even, I realized that I wouldn't be making them again unless the cost drops dramatically. <P>Although,  just to throw in some cudo's... I think the values on the other forged weapons are perfect.  Well balanced, and accessable to a wide newbie/lowbie range of buyers!  It's nice to finally have some variety in what I can make/sell. And the skill levels to make the weapons are low enough that semi-beginner smiths can actually make something useful before banded.  <P>Master Smith (140) and having fun!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Right now, throwing skill in general is a waste of time.  I mean, Rangers have been complaining since forever that being the "Masters of Archery" is about as useful as being the "Masters of Tiddlywinks".  And it is painfully obvious that Archery is many times more useful than Archery.<P>Rogues get saddled with being the "Masters of Throwing Weapons".  Monks are really the only class other than Rogues that bothers with thrown weapons.<P>Bards have offensive songs.<P>All other meleers can choose archery.<P>If you see a caster throwing knives, he is insane.<P>Some things I think would help:<P>(1) Put an extra point or two of damage on all forged Throwing weapons.  It will certainly not "Break the game."  In fact it will still not make the skill rival even a medium-quality bow.  But it will help explain the price disparity.<P>(2) Implement new recipes as follows:  Add an unenchanted silver bar (about 6 gold) to each of the current thrown weapons recipes to get identical weapons that can hit magic-only creatures.  As of now the ONLY thrown weapons I am aware of that can damage a simple Ghoul are summoned by Mages or looted in the Plane of Hate.  Also, Magic-hitting silver arrowheads have been in the game for quite some time.  A little parity please?<P>It is possible (though more expensive) to craft better arrows than a Mage can summon.

</FONT><HR>Not really a bump, just observing that I like eidolan's suggestions.  Seriously, an extra point or two of damage isn't going to make throwing significantly less useless than it already is, but it will provide some kind of reason to justify the increased cost of the forged weapons.  Magic throwing weapons would also be way cool.<P>Also, would it be possible to have some kind of stackable throwing spear?  In ancient armies, it was not uncommon for troops to advance while hurling numerous small light spears carried in a quiver-like device slung on their backs.  In EQ terms, it would be nice to be able to use throwing for pulling purposes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Make them stackable, get rid of them altogether (their a waste), or fix their damage to be 10 times current. For example, a javelin could be a 70 damage weapon.

A lot of big weapons fit in the tool boxes, large sewing kits, fletching kits, and suchlike that weakies like me carry around, but I did find a big two-hander the other day and the only bag I had that would hold it was my Bootstrutter Framed Pack.<P>Or you could just make 'em fairly heavy.  At a pound or so one could easily carry five or ten, creating utility for pulling, without being able to carry eighty (for insanity/sow kiting).<P>Just realized that this is one of the longer topics in the Trade Skills forum.
