I have done exactly as prescribed, with drivers that were sent to me by my computers manufacturer, Dell.<P>Dell service and such blows the doors completely off of everyone (I won't even try and compare to Verant here, not a fair comparison), they sent me the drivers for my specific computer that were the most up to date per my request, I verified the versions with the manufacturer, I followed the instructins and directions all the way.<P>This is a blatant screw-up by Verant.  If the game doesn't run smooth after the patch, I may as well be playing on an Atari for the quality of picture and sound I am experiencing.  What does the word TEST mean anyways?  Are you telling me that Verant doesn't have ONE computer with a setup similar to the one I just described that they could have run the game on pre-patch with the new code?

</FONT><HR>Dont use the drivers from Dell, just get the reference drivers from www.nvidia.com.<P>Your sound card isn't that good, just get a SBLive Value, you can pick them up off of www.pricewatch.com for about 50 bucks.<P>The game works just about perfect for me now, so its not the game that is doing this, its your drivers.  Don't blame them for getting thier game up to date, and when your computer doesn't like it and crashes.<P>The game probably works great for many people out there, so once again its not the game, its your drivers.  And remember, always use reference drivers over the other drivers that are supplied by dell, they are old and are only really tested for Windows, not for games.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>TheLion,<P><BR>I would suggest trying the Detonator 2 drivers instead of the dell drivers or whatever drivers you are using.  The Detonator2 drivers seem to work better with the game.  To access the detonator 2 drivers you would go to www.nvidia.com and got to support center.  Then click on drivers at the top of the website.  Scroll down to the bottom of the Webpage and click on BACK TO DRIVER LIBRARY.  This takes you to http://www.nvidia.com/products.nsf/htmlmedia/detonator3.html <BR>Near the base of the page is the words Download Detonator 2 <BR>Choose the appropriate driver for your operating system.<P>Sometimes old drivers still present in your system will cause problems.  Usually these drivers will not display themselves in regular Windows so you have to go to Safe Mode to remove them.<P>If you have Windows 95, reboot your computer. You can enter safe mode by hitting F8 when the message “Starting Windows95” appears. <P>With Windows 98 Reboot and hold down the left control (ctrl) key after you reboot your computer and you should, after a short period of time, see a menu which has an option for Safe Mode. Please choose the Safe Mode option.<P> Once you get into Safe Mode right click on My Computer, left click on Properties, go to Device Manager, and left click the plus button next to Display Adapters.  If there are any listings for cards you no longer have or multiple entries for your current video card then remove them.<P>Good Luck<BR>David Starr<BR>Verant Interactive Technical and Customer Support<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>EQCSR-David,<P>I tried the fix you suggested, but to no avail.  It was not so easy to find the Detonator 2 drive as you suggested, but I found it.  I got rid of the single driver that was listed in my Display Adapters; there was no conflict there.  I reinstalled with the Detonator 2 drivers following the instructions in the "Read Me" file provided with the Detonator 2 download.  And as usual, I rebooted at every prompt, with no programs running to foul it up.  This includes all the background SysTray stuff that I had turned off for this operation.<P>The most recent patch, that of 29 November, did improve my overall performance marginally, but I am still experiencing video and sound issues that were not there previous to the original change to the DirectX 7.0 / 7.0a.<P>Have you any further advice?<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
