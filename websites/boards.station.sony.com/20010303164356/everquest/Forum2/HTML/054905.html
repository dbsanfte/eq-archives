</FONT><HR>I would like to raise an issue to Verant.  Hopefully Absor will read this because I think we have some valid concerns or at least some good questions here.  On the test server they are currently increasing the Pally and SK's defense to that of a warrior and the Ranger's offense to that of a warrior.  <P>This concerns me.  (yes you guessed it I play a warrior)  I am going to pose a question here.  Its not meant as a flame, I really would like some good dialogue around this.  If, and I know its a big if because its still on test, these changes make it to the live servers why play a warrior?<P>Now let me expand on that a little.  First we know that warriors really do not outdamage other classes.  Rogues, Monks, and sometimes Rangers regularly outdamage us.  Yes we can do more damage then Pally's and SKs but they have some very useful spells and abilities.  That gets me to point number two.  Warriors have no spells and really no special abilities until we get disciplines and you really can't count those because, albiet very useful, they are limited.  And point three is hit points.  Yes we have more hit points than any other class.  A Pally or SK may have 300, 400, less hps then a warrior.  I know this sounds like a lot but in the high level game all this really amounts to is one or two rounds of combat and the Pally and SK have spells and abilities to compensate for this.  <P>What are warriors left with? Well we are tanks.  We have the best AC and can absorb damage better than anyone.  Period thats what we do and we are the best at it.  <P>So what happens to the warrior class if Pally's and SKs are going to have the same defensive cap?  Warriors don't outdamage anyone. (currently, even more so if this change occurs) They can't cast any spells and really have no special abilities.  (like LoH, HT, Backstab, etc.)  And all Hyrbrids will either be able to deal damage or take it just as well as we do.<P>Again this is an open ended question.  I hope that Absor reads this and we can have some good consturctive dialogue about it.     <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I know many warriors who are worried about the same thing.  And because I don't play a warrior I can't be the best judge of who needs what.  But what I do see is that warriors are much more wanted in indoor groups.  In outdoor groups Sks are often used as fearers or snarers or both.  I personally think SKs spells make up for the lack in defence and offence.  But when a group needs someone to tank SKs and Pallys do get beat up a lot more.  They don't just take a defence cap hit but also much lower AC gear, lower repost, parry and dodge, and less hit points (this isn't including defensive disciplines...).  On top of that they do less damage.  So going into a dungon to get experience and a 55 war and a 55sk lfg why would people take someone who can tank less and do less damage?<P>Before you answer that it was a retorical question.  I know the advantages of a SK of course but in most situations I'd take the warrior.<P>So what will this do?  Not much really.  It will help some of course with taking hits but even the higher AC of warriors will keep them at an advantage.  Not to mention their other defences higher.  <P>Where the situation gets sticky is when you look at all the other things SKs can do.  They can solo pretty quickly.  They have awsome taunting abilities.  They have feign death wich is one of the most life saving abilities in the game.  They can life tap to heal themselves up faster.  They can snare.  They can do some nice damage with dots at the higher levels so they can be useful in groups without clerics who want to root/dot.  They get a pretty awsome pet in the upper 50's.  They get a pretty nice nuke ever hour and a half.  They are pretty much the best class to recover corpses (even before summon corpse).  If you're a good player and you know what you're doing SKs can be a pretty awsome class.  <P>As you can see I myself dabate on what they should do about the hybrid defence increase.  The place where SKs usually fall short is in large raids.  I would suggest leaving defence as is  and adding in some useful discaplins for large raids.  There have many suggestions.  I suppose Sks do need a boost while in xp groups too and defence would help...<P><BR>/shrug<P>You wanted a little discussion on the subject and that's my opinion.  You can disagree or agree.  Because I don't know.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>point #1: <BR>currently Monks and Rogues have 252 defense cap, and have more AC than PAL/SHD at 60.  Keep in mind they do WAY more damage than PAL/SHD.<P>point #2:  <BR>Total cobalt AC: 220<BR>Total deepwater/bloodember AC: 177<BR>Differences just as much with velious class armors.<P>point #3:<BR>Warriors still have higher HP, much higher dodge/parry/riposte.<P>point #4:<BR>Remember pre-Kunark?  Hybrids had either the same defense cap or 10 points less (hybrids had 200 skill) Yet warriors were still always the preferred tank.<P>Point #5:<BR>600-1000 more HP IS a significant amount more.  It makes complete heal that much more efficient, it gives healers more time to land heal spells as your health bar will go down slower.  Even if you DID have the same hp as a SHD/PAL your health would still go down slower due to much higher dodge/parry/riposte, much higher AC equipment.<P><BR>Conclusion:<BR>Warriors will still be the best tanks.<BR>Its not even questionable.<P>What WILL change is that PAL/SHD can now fill in as main tank IF they HAVE to, and do a decent job of it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ah.. i'm sorry I have to strongly disgree with you.<P>Warriors, not any other classes, in the 50 game are REQUIRED as tanks in the post 50 game.  The hybreds have sucked for way way to long.  How do I mean that?  Warriors wheren't statisfied with better skills, higher ac, and more damage.  The warrior class got buffed.  Hybreds have had very few minor tweaks since beta, this stuff is great for them.<P>But let me put it differently.  Having to med to melee plain and simple, is not a benefit.  Hybreds, all of them, have to have mana to be at their best.  That means down time that warriors will never suffer.  Warriors need healers to tank, do do the other hybreds.  The difference is when a warrior looks ready to fight, they are.  When a hybred looks ready to fight, they can really still need 5 minutes to med.  <P>BTW Rogues are SUPPOSED to out damage every other melee class period from the back arc.  Monks are supposed to out damage warriors falling in the mid range of warriors and rogues ( although there is nearly no difference in a well equiped warrior and a well equiped monk in terms of damage per minute).   Rangers are supposed to be able to deal the same damage as a warrior.<P>All of those classes gave up something to do more damage.  Rogues and monks both gave up massive ( as in the literally have about half ) amounts of hps.  And much more limited gear selecetion.<P>Hybreds?  Sk damage is at least presentable.  Paladins are the lowest damage melees in the game. Rangers again sacrifice hps and ac for damage.<P>Warriors are not intended to be the best damage melee, if that was the case it eliminates any reason for the others to exist.  Warriors do good damage,  they excel at the role of keeping blood thristy mobs off the rest of the group so they can do their job.  Warriors are ideal for clerics to heal with the highest base hit points of any class period, and complete heal, warriors are the choice for who in the groups should take the brunt of the damage.  <P>Some people call warriors meat sheilds.  Some assume that being a good warrior takes very little skill.  That is a fiction.  The amount of time a warrior spends selecting gear, and weapons and getting them, the way they use them in specific situations,  that all takes thought and preplanning.  I don't like the term meat shield, warriors aren't there to act as some kind of pet, they are their to make sure the the other people in a group live long enought to do what they do best.<P>Warriors are the heroes without which large prey doesn't fall without deaths.  They risk the dreaded "oom" from the cleric and keep fighting because it's the only way everyone lives, and sometimes it means they throw themselves down for the group.  The compealing reason to play a warrior?<P>They are the best tanks in the game. Period bar none.  SK's and Paladins Still won't be able to take any where near beating a warrior can.  Gear selection is part of that.  Warriors have the best ac gear around and the widest weapons choices of any class, both are as it should be.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have played SK, Pal and A Warrior. I can tell you that a Warrior has nothing to fear. The Warrior will still be the best tank and deal out the most damage. When you try playing the other classes you will see what I mean. These new changes do not seem to do anything to change that. I have not played a ranger but they seem to have the highest damage and tank ablities of all the hybrid. I do not know why they can sometimes out tank the SK and Pal but I really will need to make one again and see. They seem not to get hit as much which may give them a big edge.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Try it sometime, if you can stay awake long enough to kill a single mob at lvl 55 you have accomplished something hhah its sooo slow<P>*********************************************<BR>They can life tap to heal themselves up faster.<BR>***********************************************<P>HAHAH lifetap 150 pts at lvl 56 with a 4.5 second cast time.  Nothing fast about that<P><BR>***********************************************8<BR>They can do some nice damage with dots at the higher levels so they can be useful in groups without clerics who want to root/dot. <BR>***************88**************************<P><BR>HAHAHA "nice dmg"? my best dot at lvl 56 is 500pts dmg HAHA<P>***********************************************8<BR>They get a pretty awsome pet in the upper 50's. <BR>*********************************************<BR>HAHAH yeah my lvl 30 pet is so awesome<P><BR>*************************************************8**They are pretty much the best class to recover corpses (even before summon corpse). <BR>****************************************88888***<P>Rogues and monks are way better at it.  Summon corpse spell is useful but other than that a Monk is better at CR in a zone like fear since his FD is way better, a rogue is better in a zone where you need invis since they can invis to undead and living at the same time.<P>I love my SK but i am getting torn up in sebilis with my lame defense.  Warriors my lvl with similar gear do 3X the dmg I do and take less dmg,<BR>Giving me the same defense means a warrior will still be a better tank, they will stil have better offense, weapon skill, riposite, dodge parry, etc,,, but with  a higher defense i will be able to take hits a little bit better, we all know defense is much more important than AC items, (just ask a shaman or cleric with High AC items if it ever helps them lol)<P>This is why monks and rogues are better tanks than SKs now, they have WAY better defense and thus get hit less,.  All the plate armour in the world doesnt help SKs, we are tanks and shoudl have good defense. <P>Warriors have innate stuns in kicks , WAY more HPs WAY more AC way better skills SPELLS ON ARMOUR , more weapon choices , higher taunt cap, higher bash cap <P>DISCIPLINES!!! warriors still have those,.  Defense cap will mean i can actually tank in an XP group at lvl 57 as well as I could at lvl 50 instead of defense capping so low that at lvl 60 i become completely useless and no better thana  robed caster with lame defense.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>*******************************************<BR>They can solo pretty quickly. <BR>*******************************************8<BR>this is in comparison to warriors.  Ever seen a warrior solo?  They kill a mob a little quicker and then sit for an hour.  Take you 5 mins to med back up?  At 55 you can take out low blues only using a bubble of mana and no health loss.  Well maybe you can't...  No it's not as effecient as a group for XP.  But can warriors do that?  After a few fights they sit for an hour?<P>*********************************************<BR>They can life tap to heal themselves up faster.<BR>***********************************************<P>Also compaired to warriors.  no it's not a complete heal?  Lets see.  you have about 2k hps and 4.5 sec cast time?  If there is a group you can tap from near that would take you about 10 taps?  Assuming you have some Hps left after a fight...  That's much faster than a warrior.<P>***********************************************8<BR>They can do some nice damage with dots at the higher levels so they can be useful in groups without clerics who want to root/dot. <BR>***************88**************************<BR>Well you have 3 dots you can stack and if you haven't noticed druids dots only do about 1k.  At 55 you can stack over 1k in dots that run faster than a druids so you can recast.  not as mana effecient but you will notice they drop much faster.  Also they are great taunts keeping the mob running after you when root breaks so they can easily re root.<P>***********************************************8<BR>They get a pretty awsome pet in the upper 50's. <BR>*********************************************<BR>Isn't 55 mid 50's?<BR>Level 49 pet is pretty awsome.  But I guess that's just my opinion<P>*************************************************8**They are pretty much the best class to recover corpses (even before summon corpse). <BR>****************************************88888***<BR>Well I suppose you have to be a good player to know this one.  Monks and rogues take no talent to recover most corpses while it takes a skilled SK to recover the same corpses.  Though a rogue is often better suited to recover some corpses there are many places they can't go.  And they do it at a great risk of losing their own.  Sks get both invis spells which come in handy.  They get feign death which is obvious.  Locate corpse is often a must when someone gets grav fluxed into walls and their corpse goes to some random place in the zone.  Or you could have a monk or rogue wander for hours looking for it?  Well I don't think you've ever seen a good SK...  <P>As you can see though I agree that the defence will be very useful to Sks in indoor groups.  But they already have advantages in other area's.  Unfortunatly these aren't as handy when going for "uber" items.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Offensive things warriors get that rangers don't get:<P>- Stunning kicks at 60<BR>- Triple attack at 60<BR>- Slam (some)<BR>- Very good disciplines<P>I won't go into defense because there is really no comparison.  If you want to compare ranger defense to anything, compare it to a shaman or druid.<P>At level 60, a warrior is a force.  If you aren't outdamaging a ranger at 60, you're probably tanking.  That's the only way a ranger can outdamage you.  They have to be slashing at something's back while you are eating the mob's dodge, parry, and ripostes.<P>These changes are WAY overdue.  Warriors are a solid class at level 60.  It's time they tried to make some of the other classes solid at 60 as well.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Umm if warriors don't deal good damage than who does?   Warriors will deal the third most damage of ANY class, monks and rogues being the only ones to beat them.  Now a ranger might be able to match them (assuming rumors concerning the frequency of ranger DW/DA being less are false) and possibly exceed that damage output with burn.  But what happenes to the ranger when he casts spells in melee range, class?   The answer is He gets to gate back to his bind point.<P>You want the new vision for warriors?  A potent force of destruction that can withstand punishment that would destroy any other class.  The only way you can say that warriors are still not a viable powerful class is by claiming melee damage is not terribly important, after which I will have to ask you what game you have been playing. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is good discussion and its why I posted this message.  What the last poster said actually hits home.  Warriors will be the only class that are as good as they are in both Offense and Defense.<P>If these changes make Pally's and SK's more wanted and viable at higher levels I personally support them.  Imo the worst thing is to require that a warrior or any other class be in a group before it is complete.  That just means less kills for the group and a lot of down time sitting around waiting to gather people.  Thats why I think the best thing they are testing is giving Druids and Shamans Superior Healing at 51 rather than 53.  They will not replace Cleric's in healing ability but at least you can make it in some areas, not all, of the hardest zones without having to sit around and wait for a cleric to come by or try to get one from somewhere.<P>I think that any changes that make all classes equally valueable and the game more fun are good.  I just wanted to get everyone's thoughts on this.  Good hunting!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>How did the designers get this so TOTALLY screwed up? In no game have Warriors ever been outdamaged by ANY class. Rogues have always been way down the list in damage dealing. Heck Clerics deal more damage than Rogues in some games. It is ludicrous to have Rogues do this kind of damage. They have skills like Picklock, Find/Disamr Traps, Sneak and Hide to compensate for their lack of prowess in battle. Their job has always been to scout and make sure the way was safe not to fight. Also what is up with the insane backstab damage? In every otehr game a Rogue would have to hide in shadows and sneak up behind the enemy to get in ONE backstab. Once he was visible he could not backstab that monster again. Now for some inexplicable reason Verant decides to let them backstab every 7 seconds. DUH! Oh yeah that is balance. This got all screwed up because Verant overcorrected to compensate for the fact that Rogue skills did not work for a long time. Once they got them fixed they should have nerfed them back to be the 5th or 6th best damage dealer where they belong. I saw a post on the Safehouse and a level 60 Rogue had 200 HP less than my level 60 Warrior. He also had 20 MORE AC and 200 MORE attack. Mind you my Warrior is maxed in every single skill and is wearign full Cobalt armor. This means that either the Rogue needs to be SEVERELY nerfed or the Warrior needs to be SIGNIFICANTLY increased. Add 1000 HP, 100 AC, 300 attack to the Warrior and then maybe you will be close to having it balanced with the Rogue.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&lt;&lt;this is in comparison to warriors. Ever seen a warrior solo? They kill a mob a little quicker and then sit for an hour. Take you 5 mins to med back up? &gt;&gt;&gt;<P>Yes i have seen warriors solo. they kill a mob a lot quicker and it takes a LOT more than 5 min to med from OOM to full<P><BR>*********************************************<BR>They can life tap to heal themselves up faster.<BR>***********************************************<P>&lt;&lt;Also compaired to warriors. no it's not a complete heal? Lets see. you have about 2k hps and 4.5 sec cast time? If there is a group you can tap from near that would take you about 10 taps? Assuming you have some Hps left after a fight... That's much faster than a warrior.&gt;&gt;&gt;<P>First off, tapping ina group is a waste of mana unless you have no healer in the group and are kiting.<P>***********************************************8<BR>They can do some nice damage with dots at the higher levels so they can be useful in groups without clerics who want to root/dot. <BR>***************88**************************<P>&lt;&lt;Well you have 3 dots you can stack and if you haven't noticed druids dots only do about 1k. At 55 you can stack over 1k in dots that run faster than a druids so you can recast. not as mana effecient but you will notice they drop much faster. Also they are great taunts keeping the mob running after you when root breaks so they can easily re root.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<P><BR>If i cast darkness (300) Boil (500) and heart flutter (140) by the time I am done casting ANY other melee class (rogue.warrior.ranger.monk) could easily dish out that dmg in melee.  Heck even I can dish out 900 pts of melee in the time it takes to cast all those dots not to mention the time it takes to wait for them.<P>Boils blood is useless at lvl 54 Darkness is great but only because of the snare effect<P>***********************************************8<BR>They get a pretty awsome pet in the upper 50's. <BR>*********************************************<BR>&lt;&lt;Isn't 55 mid 50's?<BR>Level 49 pet is pretty awsome. But I guess that's just my opinion<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;<P>At lvl 52 we get the lvl 39 necro pet.  Which at lvl 52 is pretty good. But at lvl 55-56 this pet really doesnt do much.  at lvl 58 we get the lvl 44 necro pet NOT the lvl 49 pet.  Its like a lvl 36 skell, yeah its nice. but at lvl 58 there are NOT many places you are going to cast it.<P>WOuld you want a lvl 44 necro in the kitchen in sebilis?<P>*************************************************8**They are pretty much the best class to recover corpses (even before summon corpse). <BR>****************************************88888***<BR>&lt;&lt;Well I suppose you have to be a good player to know this one. Monks and rogues take no talent to recover most corpses while it takes a skilled SK to recover the same corpses. Though a rogue is often better suited to recover some corpses there are many places they can't go. And they do it at a great risk of losing their own. Sks get both invis spells which come in handy. They get feign death which is obvious. Locate corpse is often a must when someone gets grav fluxed into walls and their corpse goes to some random place in the zone. Or you could have a monk or rogue wander for hours looking for it? Well I don't think you've ever seen a good SK... &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<P>I am a good SK and I do a lot of CR but in most places a rogue or monk is better, and you agreed  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>As you can see though I agree that the defence will be very useful to Sks in indoor groups.

Yes warriors do tank much better but I don't think it's 3 times as well.  I'd say twice as well if they have awseom equipment (nice Ac gear, blood points, whatever)  I have seen some awsome close to 60 wars ion seb with bloodpoints that hardly needed healing.

There's a chance that they'll be used in an xp group, but when you are on a raid they are completely worthless.  As a result, in a raid situation while Warriors are still every bit as desirable as they are in xp groups, hybrids have a very low desirability factor.<P>Don't believe me?  Go to the web pages of various so called "uber guilds".  These guilds aren't based on xping.  They are based on raids. They pick people for effectiveness, not necessarily because they are "nice people".  Check their membership requirements for Hybrids vs. Warriors...  If they want them at all.<P>Warriors always will be wanted in group and raid situations.  They are great at Offense and great at Defense.  They have all kinds of advantages and just because they can't solo (guess what, friends, most hybrids don't solo either) is no reason to say that hybrids don't need to be changed.<P>Look outside of the low/mid/pre-expansion high levels and look at the end game that alot of us are striving for.  Just as every one of us has a right to be desired in an xp group, every one of us has a right to be desired in a raiding party.<P>The changes currently on Test won't make up for all of our deficiencies either so I'd expect more changes, too.<P>Terrak Steeltalon<BR>Ranger Lord Outrider of Tunare<BR>&lt;Forsaken Conclave&gt;<BR>Bertoxxulous</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'll make you a deal verant...  take away all that other stuff you're giving us, the new spells, the earlier use of them and anything else you might be planning on giving us.  Take all that in exchange for NOT increasing our offence/weapon skills.  Do you people even consider how the Ranger class performs when making these decissions?  I think the dev team got pissed at Brad a while ago and because the Ranger was his preferred class, they decided to screw the rest of us.  How could you even consider raising our damage ability?  As it is we die in an obsenely quick amount of time.  I have been in higher level fights where the mob (not a boss mob, just standard stuff) managed to take me from full health to dead before my cleric could even finish his CH.  If you really want to balance the Ranger, leave the offence/weapon skills where they are and put our defence up to where SKs/Pallys were before the test server patch.  Not even as good as warriors, just with current SKs/Pallys.  Not asking for more hit points, not asking for higher AC, just a higher defence cap.  I can't believe you want to take a class famous for getting slaughtered due to low defense and then up the offense to ensure they get more agro and thereby die faster.  This "nerf" pisses me off more than anything I've seen done to Rangers yet.  And yes, it's a nerf in the sence that it will make Rangers even worse than they already are.  It proves how completetly out of touch you are with the Ranger class on the whole.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>With increased Damage we will have no control on the Agro.  Either turn off attack or wait till the mob is half life.<P>With the skills I have now I will build enough agro by 75% to begin taking damage then I cast jolt.  By 50% I have to cast Jolt again at 25% life Jolt doesn't work anymore.  At 50% I need to get Snare off.  In case I get a resist or some fizzles I have to start.  Mobs we are talking about?  Level 51-56(Juggs/Reets).  Sometimes if I really get lucky and dual wield and dbl attack go off alot by 50% the mob is glued to me and jolt won't work.  Nothing more frustrating to see jolt go thru and the mob not turn on the warrior but stays on you.  These are not Boss mobs these are things that are within my level.<P>When a Ranger in a normal grouping situation gets quad hit for 200s you are going to be in trouble.<P>The defense skill is what is checked to determine when you get hit.  AC determines for how much.  So I am walking into the wolfs den evertime I face mobs of levels greater than 50.  When the to hit goes off against our Defense skill it is like it is a Mob that 10 Levels on us instead of use having 5 0r 6 on them.  Same for the To hit and how much damage we do.  Keep in Mind these are blue mobs but they act more like Yellows and Reds then blues.<P>Just some things I am noticing as I fight Higher Level critters.  These are much different than the mid to upper 40s stuff in Karnor Castle.  Once the mobs go over 50 they act completely different.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>L54 warrior here... my initial reaction, reading the changes on test was "Hmmn, are they trying to put us out of business?". Then I thought about it some, and realized that the change likely won't matter.<P>Why? Warriors, Paladins, and SKs were already pretty easily at the soft cap of 1100AC, so giving more defense to paladins and SKs isn't likely to change the relative abilities to absorb damage. <P>The thing that _does_ bother me, in reflection, is that aside from fixing a bug with 2 disciplines, it appears that the other warrior concerns were deemed inappropriate. Now, as I posted elsewhere, I didn't believe we needed a boost of AC, HPs, new attacks, or the like. I _was_ hoping for them to adjust Taunt a bit, to be slightly more effective. As it stands, if you need someone to keep a mob's attention, an SK or Paladin are better equipped, thanks to the taunt of Stuns, DoTs, etc. The Defensive discipline isn't terribly useful if the mob is busy mashing the enchanter, cleric, SK, Paladin, etc. into goo before looking at the warrior.<P>Ah well. I don't think warriors are useless, or not worth playing, but I do wish that we could at least be effective in the role we seemed to be suited for (keeping a mob beating on us). <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I for one believe bumping Pal/SK defense to 252 and Ranger offense to 252 is NOT the way to go. Making us one-sided is like making us half a warrior.  Even less, really, for Paladins and SKs, because even with 252 defense, Warriors will be better tanks due to higher ac and hp.  What good is a tank who can't hit the broad side of a barn?  What good is a melee damage dealer who dies before a cleric can cast a heal?<P>Balance between the classes is important, but the hybrids also need balance within themselves.  Rangers need enough defense to mitigate the attention they inevitably attract due to the damage they deal.  Paladins and SKs need enough offense to hit the mobs often enough to keep their attention and do enough damage to make their melee time worthwhile.  Currently, Paladins and SKs do fairly well, especially adding in their taunting ability through spells.  But, overall, hybrids are WEAK.  I'd like to see all hybrids receive increases to both offense and defense with none of the hybrids quite reaching the skill caps of warriors.<P>I'd like to see the hybrid offense/defense caps raised as follows:<P>Rangers - 245 offense (up 5 points) and 220 defense (up 20 points)<BR>Paladins - 235 offense (up 10 points) and 245 defense (up 15 points)<BR>Shadow Knights - 240 offense (up 15 points) and 240 defense (up 10 points)<BR>Bards - 225 offense (up 10 points) and 225 defense (up 10 points)<P>This gives each hybrid 25 skills points (except 20 for bards) with the points distributed differently for each class.  This would make each hybrid overall stronger while maintaining a balance within each class.  And by making Shadow Knights even at 240, it gives them a slightly different flavor as a middle ground, with Paladins remaining more defensive in nature and Rangers more offensive in nature.  All hybrids would remain weaker than warriors in all areas but would become strong enough in tanking and melee to make us viable alternatives to a warrior in an experience group.  I think these changes, along with the hybrid spell changes on Test, would make hybrids roughly equal in "Power" to warriors, monks and rogues.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Laldarie - Wow!  Great post!  You summed it all up brilliantly.  Only thing I would change though is: as a Ranger I'd rather offence stayed where it was and put defence up to the old Paladin cap of 230.  Rangers do perfectly well offensively.  We need no improvement there.  Defensively we literally are the joke class in EQ.  I can't remember the last time I logged and did not hear some sort of crack about Rangers dying so easily.  The last thing we need is another way to get more agro (ei: higher offense/weapon skills)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Personally, I think allowing spell casters to wear plate is fine.  The trick is to make the wearing of armor have sufficient draw backs so as to be unattractive.<P>For example, in Baldur's Gate II, a dual/multi classes mage or a bard can't cast spells while wearing armor.  Plus, many of their AC 'buffs' don't stack with AC.<P>It wouldnt' work in EQ because the AC buffs would stack with the armor, even if the wearing of armor caused casting difficulties for casters.

</FONT><HR><BR>Actually, there isn't much "logic" in the armor/weapon restrictions of casters in Everquest.  Just as there isn't much "logic" in the DnD 1st edition rules.   <P>For instance, the whole Staff/Dagger thing.   One of the most famous wizards of all time, Gandalf, swung a sword from time to time.    <P>The issue with magic users and weapons is that they won't be good with them, not that they can't use them.   Personally, I'd say that magic users could use any weapon..  they'll just find themselves not nearly as skilled as somoene who actually trained in weaponcraft.<P>As for armor, this comes from legends/myths that iron some how interferes with the casting of magic spells.  DnD changed this to something more along the lines of its restrictiveness of movement was the problem (thus Leather armor was banned).<P>In Everquest, there really isn't much logic at all.  We'll assume that wisdom casters and paladins and rangers cast spells via communing with their god.  (That god they slew two nights ago, funny enough).     Bards do so with song.  <P>What about Shadowknights? They derive their spells from necromancy.  Necromancy isn't prayer based, yet somehow shadowknights are able to cast spells *and* wear armor.  <P>It would actually make more sense if Necromancers were wisdom based (prayer based) casters.   <P>Anyway, logic really doesn't play that much of a part in this game anyway.  Everquest has become a game of "rules" not of "reality" per sey.   That's why we let monks feign pull, even though this would be laughed off the table at any pen and paper session by a reputable dungeon master.  <P>It doesn't make Everquest a bad game, but it certainly makes comparisons to role playing games a little out of place.    <P>If we treated Everquest as a role playing game we'd have to make massive, wholesale changes.  Feign Pulling would have to go.. monster sees PC die, monster sees PC move, Monster sees PC die again and impales PC just to make sure.   <P>We'd have to have actual reprecussions for killing a God.  Follower of Inny kills Inny its going to be a little harder to pray to Inny for spells.    <P>Heck, my character is Agnostic.  He's been to Hate and Growth.. but still is not sure if Tunare or Inny actually exists?  Perhaps going to a Plane should be a mini-quest for Agnostic people who are then allowed to choose a god (being presented with proof they exist should do something).    <P>No, its not that type of game. Fun to play (been playing since Beta 4 so there's obviously something there) but lets not nitpick.  Its a game of rulesets where the "game" is using the rules to win.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Certainly not hybrids.  Even with the changes on the test server hybrids will be useless for tanking in uber raids.  What is especially pathetic is that shadowknights and paladins are supposedly "defensive" hybrids but yet they are not acceptable to tank any of the major hard hitters in velious.  Only warriors.
