</FONT><HR>Eldanon has it right.  This is basically a question that could be solved with knowledge of the english language. <P>"If mages are the masters of sumoning then why cant they SUMMON a corpse?"<P>Mages are the masters of conjuration.  They can conjure, summon, or evoke stuff out of thin air.  (IE food, daggers, bandages, arrows, etc.)  Basically they are 'summoners' per the LAST (#5) definition of summon in the dictionary. 'To call forth;evoke'.  <BR>'Summon Corpse' is not a conjuring type of thing.  You are NOT summoning something out of thin air. We are using number 1 or 2 of the definition of the word summon. #1 to call together -or- #2 to request to appear, to send for.  <BR>The english language is a complicated thing.  They should have called mages the masters of conjuration and name their spells 'Conjure Food', etc. to avoid confusion.<BR>Besides, doesn't the 'Summon Corpse' spell use a 120pp regent?  (It the regent consumed or re-usable btw?)    </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Its really very simple, everyone can summon a corpse. But if you want to summon one to do your bidding well then you need to be a necromacer because that is what their specialty is. If you want to translocate a corpse well then you need a translocation spell with a skill to find and a very good range for it to be practical. Next time figure out what you want before you make a fool of yourself.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ickymug said:<BR>"Now if we certianly summon a hero then Y cant we summon his corpse??"<P>Actually it doesn't make much sense for mages to even have Call of Hero (its not called summon, btw). In essense it creates a portal that takes the PC and teleports him to the mage. It should have been a wizard spell, THEY are the teleporting casters, not mages.<P>Anyway, back to Summon Corpse... it is a logical progression, first necros can Locate Corpse, then Track Corpse, then Summon Corpse (bring it to them). <P>A mage having this spell would totally not make any sense... Like several people in the thread already answered, the word "summon" in "Summon Food" and "Summon Corpse" have two completely different meanings behind it.<P>PS. Ra2438, yes the coffin is consumed after casting this spell (175pp I believe is the price of it). The cool part is if the spell is interrupted, the coffin is still consumed hehe<P>Eldanon Shadowwalker<BR>The Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hey now, this is a perfectly logical request.  Using any definition of Summon.  I don't particularly care if we Mages get Summon Corpse because of the ludicrous cost of the reagent (why summon your corpse when you can fight on the Planes naked?)  but it is completely logical for a Mage to be able to summon a corpse accross the zone.  If any of you know your Everquest Lore, you'd know that our Elementals themselves are merely creatures summoned from another plane into Norrath to do a Magician's bidding.  Kinda reminds me of the Protoss on Starcraft... <P>It does NOT even make total sense that Necromancers are able to summon corpses.  Sure, they are masters of the dead, but Raise Corpse would be something more logical.  You forget, they are masters of RAISING the dead, not SUMMONING it (hence you need Bone Chips from a Skeleton to RAISE a skeleton warrior).  And you also forget that when a Necromancer RAISES the dead they supposedly command their soul as well.  A ressurection spell would make more sense for the Necromancer class, not summoning a corpse  (yes, I know there is now a Necromancer ressurection spell that requires a sacrafice).<P>When I first decided to become a dedicated Mage (my first character), I envisioned him to become like that lady in the Intro who summoned the powerful Flame Dragon to gobble up all the Trolls.. and what he has become is merely a powerhouse of damage that seems rarely needed in groups as all of his skills are covered by various other classes and who eventually has become unable to solo powerful creatures that are a walk in the park to a Necromancer, even without a pet.  <P>But hey, I get by, and am content, but to have a post with a bunch of Necro's defending a spell they themselves rarely ever use is just pathetic.  If you want to "Play your Class", Magicians are not masters of Conjuration, they ARE masters of SUMMONING, and to SUMMON a corpse (which is by definition 1 and 2 what you are doing) is covered in that class definition.  Necromancers should be raising that corpse, not calling it to them.  What's the difference between summoning a lifeless inanimate form (the body) and a lifeless inanimate form (some food)?<P>And as for Call of the Hero (note the word "Call" in there), first off, the Hero has to be in the same dungeon, in generally the same area, they must be in your group, and it requires a Pearl.  About as useless as the new Sacrafice spell, but it fits the class and there's no reason why summoning a corpse wouldn't.<P>-Esmos Darkmage</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>NO<P>you're absolutely wrong.<P>2 definitions of the word "summon" are being confused here.  mages are the masters of summoning, as in creating something out of nothing, hence spells like summon food, water, daggers.  they create these items without any reagents - from another astral plane, perhaps.  this type of summon is "conjuration".<P>summon corpse means to call the corpse to oneself.  this is not creating a corpse as in conjuration.  this is merely calling the corpse to you from somewhere in the zone.  it is not creating a corpse by summoning it from another plane.<P>goddamnit....why the hell are you mages so greedy anyway?  what significance is it if you don't have summon corpse.  just another case of class envy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>S0meguy, you're absolutely wrong in my humble opinion (ok, maybe not so humble).<P>You said: "Magicians are not masters of Conjuration, they ARE masters of SUMMONING"<P>Well, they are masters of summoning as long as you use the word summon to mean CONJURE, THAT is what they're masters of... not of moving things from a location to you.<P>"What's the difference between summoning a lifeless inanimate form (the body) and a lifeless inanimate form (some food)?"<P>The difference is, once again... all mage spells conjure (summon) an item out of nothing - like food or drink. You can CONJURE a globe of water but you can't SUMMON to you the 30pp from the pocket of that Hill Giant.<P>All of the above has been explained by a bunch of people in this post but obviously you don't like following logic, thats ok =) Once again, Summon Corpse should have been either called something different... OR mage spells should've been Conjure Food, etc.<P>And the reason we're defending this "useless spell" as you put it, is because it makes NO SENSE for a mage to have it, none, zip, nada, zilch. Just like it'd make NO SENSE for a druid, cleric or shaman to have it (all of which can summon food/drink)<P>Eldanon Shadowwalker<BR>The Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>perhaps this argument has become too narrow in its scope.  It seems to me that some are suggesting that magicians should only have one trick up their sleeves.  If it isn't directly related to the way in which they summon elementals, they shouldn't be able to do it, so the argument goes.  Hmmm, I see.  So, how is it we are able to gate and bind?  Perhaps we should take those spells away from mages, because they shouldn't be able to do those things, as they do not relate to other planes in any way.  In fact, any spell that does not fall in the conjuration field of magic should be taken away from the magicians, as it makes no sense that they should be able to do more than one thing.<P>And again, I must point out that the word summon means: to order to come or appear; to call for or send for with authority or urgancy.  The word conjure means: to summon as by a magic spell.  So by limiting the argument to dictionary definitions, there should be no problem having magicians summon anything at all.<P>The true question should be, would the magician, as a class, be interested in corpses?  Probably not.  They do seem more compelled by elemental magics than anything else, so it is not wholely unreasonable that they should be excluded from summoning corpses.  <P>And frankly, I wouldn't want to see such a seldom used and costly spell added to our lineup, as it would surely result in verant concluding that our lineup needs no more fleshing out. (Which in fact it does.)  I am not suggesting we are underpowered.  I simply think the class could be a bit more fun to play if we had some other things to do from time to time besides sick our pet on the monster, nuke a couple times, then sit down.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I am a Mage, I also think we should NOT get summon corpse, technically I believe we could, but I wouldn't want it for the same reason above--VI would see it as where ok now, and don't need tweaked.<P>Call of the Hero is no differant than our other spells, so what if that food we just summoned was food from another plane that we just "TELEPORTED" to our side.  Thats how all of our Summoning spells work.  Call of the Hero simply does this same thing, except the "other" plane is the same one we happen to be on atm.<P>Amnd(out of a roleplaying mode now) Call of the Hero doesn't do jack, other than make it so if you get STUCK due to a BUG, a mage can help, other than that, it's usless, 12 sec casting time makes it not worth casting to save a puller, and with a pearl regent makes it not worth casting for luxury.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>First of all I would like to restate the fact that Nec's are masters of the dead as we all already know. Second I would like to make sure that we all know that any corpse is only a corpse because it is dead, hence the name. <P>Although I believe this spell to be absolutely useless due to its high cost, it is one of the characteristics of a necromancer to do what he/she wants with the dead, simply because it is dead. Taking one of these "characteristics" and giving them to a character who is not a master of the dead is simply, well, dumb. Its like giving a Necromancer Lay Hands from the Paladin class.<P>There are several spells that make up the characteristic of the class of character and summon the dead is one for the necromancer. Just like there are several very basic spells that can be used by just about anyone, like Root. Those spells seem to be more characteristic of certain classes than they are of others wich is why the Druid and Ranger get it at lower levels than a necromancer. A mage has their own characteristic spells that no one else is able to use. Its what makes us all unique.<P>It was more than likely on these basis, not by any dictionary definition, that the authors programed EQ in this way. Trying to preserve a characteristic of a race and class is an excellent idea, however many other things that I do not believe to be characteristic of only certain classes or races can be argued, but that is for another post.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I summon my corpse to me all the time. I dont use a spell to do it either. I use a hot button. Granted im usually in sight of the damn thing by the time it locates it but just the same i do summon it and it comes to me. Anyone can do it. So basically this thread is misguided. You want to locate your corpse. You want your corpse to follow you to your bind point. You want the game to be easier for you. Wwhy? What reason would you have for saying this game is great if you had those things. Live with the limitations you have as they are meant to be there for you. They are very much a part of your character as you int, wis, char, str,dex all are. You have to know how to play your character and the only way to know is to learn by mistakes. Mistakes kill you but would you want to have to start aa new character every time you died?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=002459&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=002459&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
