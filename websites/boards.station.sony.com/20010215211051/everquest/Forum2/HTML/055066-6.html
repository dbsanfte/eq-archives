</FONT><HR>Bein:  Your other questions.  Mmm.  You asked 2.  Who I was and what I did.  Well, I gotta tell you that there is a lot of the "how to play a wizard" stuff out there that I do use...and rewriting it here would be a waste...and would probably not be as good.<P>*shrug*  <P>I am a wizard.  Mostly I nuke.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>With root over snare (thank you!) I can be a LOT more useful for emergency crowd control.  I can evac, but way more often we pick spots we can get our corpses and camp or die, eh?<P>But really, mostly I take a couple thousand hitpoints off the critters and medd a lot.  I like it.  When I don't want to do that I play my twink herd, or one of my nontwinked herd.  If things are bad, I may take 5 x 1120 off a mob, but that is rare, eh?<P>I really wonder if this is the key to high level wizard unhappiness:  at 50, 1100 dmg IC is an UBER spell.  After that, it is not.  We expected to get to 50 and be wicked-powerful.  And we are not.  After 50, PC's get steadily weaker against NPC's.  All in all, I think the post-50 game was a mistake, in hindsight, and I never would have believed it before it came out.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>While not a 'balance' idea, Grims' idea for a cute Familiar fits my own 'vision' of a Wizards Familiar quest.<P>Nevermind if the creature had any utility at all, if I could use it as an Eye of Zomm, I would think it was good enough for the nifty visuals...<P>Forms I would like to see;<P>Imp Familiar, same as Kindle / Fire Imps but a tad smaller (around Brownie sized for all).  From Neriak Wizards guild.<P>Drake Familiar - same as an Onyx Drake or Fire Drake (or other colors), but smaller.  From Freeport / Qeynos Wizards guilds (Red-scaled for Freeport, Black-scaled for Qeynos).<P>Faerie Familiar - or alternately, a Brownie / Pixie of some sort.  From Felwithe Wizards guild.  Complete with annoying tinkle-bell music.<P>Cat Familiar - appears as a Siamese.  From Erudite Wizards guild.  Complete with annoying 'howl' and snooty Erudite attitude.<P>Clockwork Spiderling Familiar - as it sounds.  From Ak'Anon Wizards guild.  Buzz, whir, click.<P>Each of these critters would result from a quest in the appropriate Wizards guild (and with faction work, a Wizard from one guild could go do another guilds quests if he prefers that graphic) and the creature would be summoned from a No Drop Wizard only clickable item called 'A Familiar Icon' with a 30 second casting time.  The creature would then follow around like an ineffectual pet unless a variant Eye of Zomm spell called 'The Familiars Eye' was cast, in which case the Wizard would find himself in control of the creature and able to move it around like an Eye of Zomm and see through it's eyes.  It also would be affected by a Voice Graft spell that would be made available at that time as well.<P>If it were deemed appropriate to make it actually more useful in combat, I would have the Icon quests scale up in power and be roughly 1/4 of the power of the Wizard.  The first one would then be available at 8th level and function as a 2nd level Wizard (with appropriate hit points, skills and spells), while the final 'Familiar Icon' would be usable at 49th level and summon a 12th level Wizard as a 'pet.'  In no case would the contributions of a Wizard 1/4th the casters level (or less) add over 10% of the damage output of that casters own spells, but would still contribute relatively small amounts.<P>Whether or not this 'pet' would be controllable with /pet commands or simply follow the caster around like an Enchanter animation would also be up to the balance team.<P>Any other fun graphics that would make sense for Familiars?<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Paralysing earth root that we get is not effective against mobs with hig MR like those icewell or Velketor's lab.  The necro paralysing earth on the other hand gets resisted much less.  Since we dont get an upgrade to our roots till fetter, I think paralysing earth should be made just as powerful as the necros or more.  Enstill is a joke that I have never used.  I seriously think our root series of spells should be examined more.  As a wizard, i try to assist the enchanter at the starting of the fight by stuns and roots and if they get resisted, I am not of much use.<P>The only way I can get mobs to take dmg is use to use AE rains on them if I can or burn mana on nukes which get resisted as well.   Either reduce the resist check on nukes or increase dmg.<P>Mana regen post 50 via harvest is not enough.  I would like harvest to give me at least a full bubble of mana with 200+ int and a couple of hundred mana items past 50.  If you hunt in velious with the current dmg and resists and mana pool, you would see the difficulty.  Other classes have pets which play a major role in addressing downtime.<P>Other than than, I agree with Grimstaff on fixing our vision line of spells. How about fixing plain sight to filter weather and water as well, eh?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I cannot resist the temptation, since we are seeing closed subjects revisited.  I do believe these would make wizards more welcome in groups, and would help many of them do a better job.  Nothing like a little peer pressure:  "Hey man, drop a nuke on this thing, it is tearing the tanks up." and "Relax, save some mana, dude, the tanks have it."  and "WHOA you keep smacking that thing for 1120 a pop and it is gonna chase your wizard behind all over Sol B LIGHTEN UP." and finally, a few fights of watching the mage that the wizzie is Sooooo jealous of get resisted will help a lot with unhappiness...of wizzies anyway.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Show the mana bars in status window.<P>This allows WAY better strategizing during a fight.  As a blaster, I take it as my mission to finish every fight with my mana matching the healer.  Sure would be nice to be able to adjust on the fly rather than after the fight.<P>Show the damage due to spells to everyone.<P>We already all see the message, and the caster gets to see the damage.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I like the Familiars only because its fun which I think is missing a bit too often in-game with some spells. There was a spell that Mage's got in Kunark that casts up a bag of party goodies(beer,cake and some such stuff) and all they did was knock Verant for making it and when they asked Gordon why they got such a "worthless" spell he said "because its fun"...too bad many didn't see it that way.<P>If the Familiars were nothing more then a funny pet and didn't infringe on the pet classes( its more for show then fuction) i think that would be great, maybe a voice graph like the Necros have with there pets so if a few Wizards ran into one another the pets could start bickering with one another..would be fuuny to watch the fight insue  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">or maybe they would cheer the Wizard on in a fight that would too funny  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>P.S to make it a bit eaiser maybe there should just be two kinds: Imps for the Evil God followers and Fay Drakes for the Good God followers so there isn't that much that has to be changed in the zones. We really need a few more "fun" spells if you ask me.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Grimstaff mentioned being outgunned 34-38.  I believe he is talking about the bolt which hits for a max of 333 while the wizard nuke, Ice Shock, hits for a max of 320.<P>I just wanted to say that as a magician level's 34-38 were rather difficult for me.  I don't think that the nukes we have at that level are at all overpowered.  I would typically switch to my lesser damage blast because the bolt would always taunt too much.  At 43 I rarely use the bolt, it has a slow casting time(5) and is difficult to control taunt.  The blast for 295 has about the same damage/mana ratio and has a 4.6 cast time.<P>Ice Shock has a 4.1 cast time and has a better mana ratio.  I suppose it could be better, but Ice Shock is still superior to anything magicians have at that level.<P>I do admit it would be nice to replace o'kiels flickering flame with a bolt like the mages have.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor:<BR>	What is your vision for this class?  What is the designer’s view of our niche in this game?  From my read of your post here and in regard to other classes lots of wizards have a misconception of what the class is about.<BR>	My view is that we are the pure damage casters.  This means we give up versatility for that role.  I think that when you design in a lack of versatility it should mean the class is significantly better in the limited role assigned than any other class.  Other “pure” classes, in my view, have significant advantages over other classes, which you and the designers seem intent on maintaining.  (clerics will always have better heals and be the only class to resurrect, warriors will always be the best tanks, “better equipment/better skills”)  <BR>	I understand that wizards do have the ability to cast on mobs, with less resists, than other casters, and we have a variety of spells damage spells of each type (magic, cold and heat), but as currently implemented in the game these advantages do not make us as desirable in a group as the more versatile classes.  Wizards do not have the ability to inflict significantly more damage then the other caster classes.  Our ability to dish it out quickly is not that much faster than other damage casting classes that it makes a real difference.  Also, at the higher levels wizards can not keep pace in damage with the melee classes and the most damaging spells we have don’t do the % of damage to mobs that would be done a lower levels.  I will not layout the details of this argument because it has been stated much better than I can do by others else where.  What I would like to know is why do you think that wizards should not be able to shine at nuking to the same degree that warriors tank and clerics heal?  This truly is a question of balance.<BR>	Of all the suggestions I have seen to rebalance the wizard class the one that makes the most sense to me is a wizard spell to increase manna regeneration or an innate ability to meditate faster.  On the face of it this solution suffers the least drawbacks and would be the easiest to implement.<BR>	Speaking of balance since the game started the melee and healing classes have had healing and damage capabilities increased in a way that has reduced the relative effectiveness of all damage casting classes.  Always introducing new and improved melee equipment without some offsetting improvement in casting ability is unbalancing.<BR>	I saw in a wizard thread that one of the functions for wizards in uber encounters is the ability to use our stun spells.  I also see that it is under consideration to give stun spells to the Paladins.  Who there actually plays this class because from what I have seen when addressing the problems of this class all we get are Band-Aids on sucking chest wounds.  This takes me back to my first question, which is what the vision for this class?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I'll pass on the pointy cone.<P>Since Grim did a good job via point to point, I'll  keep my comments breifer and more broad.<P>Were suppsoed to be the masters of DD, although we are regualry overshadowed in that department or at times surprassed by other casters. Which leaves the only thing we really have over the other classes is porting. Somehow that is supposed to stack against pets, summoning objects, useful party spells, healing (illusion/drain spells), etc. <P>Maybe the vision of wizards dealing out anymore damage is antiquated and they arent willing to allow for improvements there. Im Ok with that, visions change. But if thats the case then allow for some other 'speciality' (there have been a ton of suggestions here) for the wizard class, to define them more as a Porting Mage without a Pet.<P>my 2 cents</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just wanted to make two unrelated comments:<P>1) Belissa – at level 35, you are not really at the level yet to start feeling the struggle to find groups. It starts at around L40. Unless you have a solid group of friends or have a strong presence in a guild, you will have increasing difficulty getting into pick-up groups post 40. For me, it was like night and day. One day I can typically get into pick-up groups fairly easily. Next day I find getting into pick-up groups is a minimum 1 hour fiasco at best. There are definitely changes occurring with other classes, with the wizard class, and with how the game is played as you enter the high level game, that sorta begins around L40.<P>2) Some folks have made quite a few posts suggesting that items be created and implemented to help balance out the wizard class. Other folks have pointed out how existing wizard items are rendered mute because the casting time is too long. I’d just like to throw out there that while I like the idea of new and/or improved wizard items, I don’t really think they help with ‘balance.’ I don’t want to have to have cool_item_01 to feel like I’m balanced.<P>Thanks for reading.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>For those who are still looking at the arguments comparing wizards to other classes, I'd like to point out that what people are saying is NOT an issue we see with the other class, but a problem with the wizard class itself.<P>If the wizard class is supposed to be the masters of magical damage, then we should NOT be doing just as much, or close to the amount of DD damage as the other casters are able to do.  Rather than nerf the other classes, wizards would like to see a proper balance.  Our DD spells vs your DD spells plus your pets is NOT balanced, and wizard DD spells end up being "not enough" to compensate.<P>Unresistable roots, AoE roots, increased mana recovery(to let us get back into action sooner), and so on are NOT calls to make us BETTER than the other classes, but are a request/demand that we at least are considered balanced against all other classes, not just other caster classes which DO have their own balance issues vs. melee classes.<P>Rather than arguing with other classes, we should be asking why melees with the right equipment can outdamage us.  There's no spell upgrades which increase our damage output.  A level 46 warrior could potentially get a full set of PoG armor, and some uber weapons, then outdamage a level 55 wizard in a battle.  This is simply because there is no "power upgrades" to wizards.  We get new spells, not through quests, but through rare-drops which are very rare, and which we need to wait on anyway.  <P>In the pre-50 game, we had to wait for the next set of spells to do damage of a different type.  While this was annoying, when we DID get new spells, they were MUCH more powerful.  Conflagration doing 606 damage at 44 was a VERY nice jump from the previous shock spell.  Going to 49, we went from 606 to 1110(more damage had a MUCH longer casting time).  At 51, we got draught, 3 second cast doing 643 damage.  Not a problem, the mana cost made it worth it, and the short casting time reduced interuptions.  BUT, as I have already posted, Voltaic draught should do at least 800 damage for the same cost, or a slightly higher cost.  But it does the same damage.  How do we go up in level, need to get these new spells, but don't do additional damage?  I've posted a list of most of the post 50 spell lines in a previous posting, so won't go into it here.<P>In short, we want our class balanced, not against the other classes, but against ALL classes.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> As a warrior/paladin, my take on the wizard problem is this: with the mob max hp increased to some incredibly huge number, wizards simply will run out of mana early in some fights, and so will end up being outdamaged by melee classes.  <P> Ideally, a way to increase wizard damage output would be to increase their mana regen rates to a high enough level that they could outdamage melees even if the mob had 300,000 hp.  The problem is, if you do that, wizards will become gods of soloing, which is not a good thing IMHO.  <P>  So, my suggestion would be this:  double (or whatever) the wizard's mana regen rate if he is in a group of 5 or more people that includes at least one tank class.  The roleplaying justification for this?   Well, meditate is supposed to be a state of extreme concentration that helps the caster restore his ability to cast spells.  Well, wouldn't YOU feel safer and better able to concentrate if you had a 500 pound ogre warrior, bristling with armor and weapons, standing guard over you?  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I posted this list before, but thought each point needed expounding:<P>1)  How many magic-proof mobs can you think of in Norrath?  Plenty.  How many melee-proof mobs can you think of?  No wonder the melee and pet classes dont need nukers.  This game has shifted power way to far to melee in my opinion.  Melee groups would think twice about leaving the nuker behind if they might run into a mob they could not touch a hair on.<P>2) Did you know a 60 Enchanter with Theft of Thought can get 400 mana every two minutes and steal it from mobs?  Accollade:  We should not get a "Group Harvest" that would give mana to the group members (chanter's realm), but a mana bonus given to us when we are in a group to help us keep up with the group (self-only like 99% of our other spells).  For instance, a level 60 wizard in a group of three tanks, cleric, and chanter could get 60 mana per group member, ie 300 mana, every 2 minutes.  A 60 wiz with two others could get 120 every 2 minutes.  A solo wiz gets nothing.  The whole point of this is to make wizards more useful in group-based situations.  We already solo just fine in my opinion.  Would help with long velious fights too if we could add an extra nuke every couple minutes.<P>3) I really like and have always advocated that the Enstill line should get a minimum amount of time to last.  They break when hit just like mez, but they don't immobilize a creature - it can still melee, cast spells, and summon.  If enstill were fixed mez would still be preferable.  Yet the enstill line is very highly resisted and breaks almost immediately.  A spell has to be mostly dependable before it will be worth using.<P>4) If root is fixed, then post-50 we need an immunity to summons.  Root is worthless if the mob can just keep chain-summoning you into melee range.  This buff is right up our line since we know how to teleport we should know how to block a summons.  Would be a unique ability we could offer to groups.  Downside might be you would have to click to take it off before being Call of Hero'ed.<P>5) AlKabors can hit unlimited targets?  So can Jyll's.  AlKabors is far less mana efficient than Jyll's.  To fix AlKabors, a stun could be added to the line, and/or you could just simply make it mana efficient as Jyll's.  I would say give them a short stun AND make them as mana eff as Jyll's since point blank spells are preferable when AEing anyway.  Someone's idea of having Alkabors put the aggro on the targetted PC was a nice idea of how to make us useful to groups.  Would probably not be too popular with players though since any AE spell interrupts mez.<P>6-9) Many of our level 59 and 60 spells just plain cost too much mana for the damage they do (see below).  Lures are resisted much more than they used to be (nerfed) but has not been made any more mana efficient.<P>10) Eye of Zomm is only ever used for pulling mobs.  Eye of Tallon should be an upgrade to that purpose but it is not.  First, it should not magnify sight, that only limits perihperal vision.  Second, it should have a longer duration.  Third, it should really be invis.  Forth, would be nice if our invis eye could go up to a mob and attack it to pull the mob.<P>11) Point blank AE roots/enstills would be helpful.  We cannot risk rooting ourself so would need to be point-blank.  Like above, would still have problems that mob can still hit and cast spells (and summon unless we get resist buff) so in no way would it be as nice as mez.  I think a PB AE Concussion would be a useful upgrade and assist us in using our other AE spells.  A PB AE stun+dd even if small would help us AE with enchanters.<P>12) And finally, Verant promised tanks would never get gate.  Yet translocate costs them nothing.  Don't get me wrong, it sure helps during a raid when someone desperately needs to leave due to RL issues.  But it should at least wipe all their coin (or something).<P><BR>Here's the list of "balance" issues I consider most important that Absor has not yet addressed or ackowledged:<P>1) Melee proof mobs.<BR>2) Group based mana bonus.<BR>3) Minimum amount of time Enstill type spells will last. (Leave snares as they are.)<BR>4) Resist Summon buff (need this or root worthless above 50).<BR>5) Alkabors: stun, mana eff as Jyll's, or transfer aggro to targetted PC (nice idea).  <BR>6) Level 59 Vengence of Alkabor - should only cost 470 mana (similar to tbold), not 700.<BR>7) Level 60 Winds of Gelid should be 550 mana (more than Jyll's less than Pillar), not 875.<BR>8) Level 59 Invert Gravity should cost less than 200 mana not 500 for puny damage it does.<BR>9) Make Lures less resistable like they used to be or improve mana eff.<BR>10) Eye of Tallon should not magnify sight, should get longer duration, 100% invis, and can attack to pull mob.<BR>11) PB AE roots, PB AE Concussion, or PB AE stun+dd.<BR>12) Translocate should wipe the tank of all the coin on them (gate should not be free!!!).<P>Other issues that would be nice:<P>1) Elemental Armor, Resistant Skin, Thunderclap upgrades.<BR>2) Wiz Diamond Rod off Innoruk should not cost Peridot to cast.<BR>3) Manastone should work for Int classes that cannot abuse it.<BR>4) Increase Markar's Discord drop rate.<BR>5) Manksink should absorb dots, more damage, or a limited number of spells.<P>Ninaeve of the Rathe (level 58 perspective)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I know some of the suggestions I'm proposing here aren't specifically balance issues, but more of enhancements.  I do think that they would contribute greatly to the desire of having a wizard in a group and a wizard's usefulness in general, which would have an effect on overall balance.<P>- Spell that takes group to YOUR bind point.<P>- Wizard levitate should allow vertical movement, making it a fly spell.  It should also default to hovering, not sinking in height like it currently does.<P>- please add lightning effects.  I know it's just eye candy, but sometimes that really does add to the immersion factor.<P>- Concentration Spell.  Warriors and the like have haste.  Wizards should have spells and items similar to that, but for casting.  It might cut cast/recast time 25%. There could also be a group version. It would be a useful buff for the wizard making them desirable in groups.  There's the Cloak of Flames for tanks, there could be a Cloak of Casting.<P>- Many more wizard items and quests.  We're left out in damage dealing and we're left out on items and quests as well.<P>- fix the zero distance vertical bug.  It's lame to run out of the DL tunnel and be 300ft over a giant and get hit.<P>- distance ranging in general is broken.  Bonds of Force and Atol's have ranging issues over non-flat terrain, especially steep hillsides.  I can be literally 20ft from a mob and get an out of range error.  Oddly enough, I don't think the problem is as severe with my DD spells.<P>- please give us some DD upgrades in the 50s to allow us to contribute in Velious.<P>- please upgrade all wizard DD spells to truly make us the masters of damage.  5-10% more damage isn't a big deal.  A magician gets a killer pet, and we get a sliver more damage?  That puts the wizard at a severe disadvantage and clearly illustrates why wizards are not wanted in groups.  I'm not asking you to triple the damage they do, but to boost the damage to balance us.  Wizards only have spells to do combat and those spells should not be marginally superior, but distinctly superior.<P>Those are some more suggestions.  Some are more radical than others, but I'm sure you can see what wizards feel we need from the 7 threads we've had.<P>I know many people don't understand the work that goes into developing and maintaining a game like EverQuest.  I do.  Despite all it's bugs and issues, EverQuest is a great game.  I just don't want to have a class that's undesirable.  I like the game, but if I can't contribute to a group anymore, I'm going to have to stop playing it, and I don't want to.  I appreciate your attentiveness and hard work to make the game even better and I hope that my suggestions can help in some small way.

The lack of wizard feedback to group members compounds the problem of ‘bad press.’ This is because many classes are unable to perceive whatever usefulness the wizard is able to currently bring to the group.<P>And as we all know, perceptions affect the ‘real’ world – and Verant’s world cannot escape this reality because we, as players, all exist in the real world and bring all the complexities of real life into Verant’s world. If you doubt what I’m saying, just think ‘stock market.’<P>So how about it? Why not, for once and for all, reconsider the notion that mana DOES NOT have to be so darned mysterious.<P>Other things that sorta fall under this discussion and related to wizards, their mana, and how a group could better perceive the wizards contributions:<P>1) Show the mana bar. Ok we discussed this, however allow client-side to disable this feature for those that don’t want it cluttering up their screen.<BR>2) For god’s sake, display a text message that let’s group members see the damage a nuke lands on a mob for, in the form of a number, just like we can see how much damage a meleer does to a mob, in the form of a number. Allow Chat options client side to disable this text.<BR>3) Display a text message for group members showing when a mob has been affected by a caster ‘crowd control’ type spell. A_mob_01 has been stunned by wizze_02. A_mob_02 has been snared by druid_03. This would be beneficial for all casters. Everybody is typing these messages anyway, why not make it more fluid for the players so they don’t have to type these message during a fight. Likewise, show a text message when the effects of these casts on the mob have ceased. This would allow for instant changes in the dynamics of group strategy during a fight. Again, put a client-side chat option to disable this text for those that don’t want it.<BR>4) Display a text message to the group that shows full and/or partial resists, so that group members know when the caster is having problems landing a nuke on a mob. This could help a lot with changing group strategy during a fight without the need for the caster to type frantically type: ‘hving prbs lading nkes…’ Again, put a client-side chat option to disable this text for those that don’t want it.<P>Basically, put some feedback about what the wizard (and other casters for that matter) is doing to help the group kill mobs. As it is now, many players out there who’s life does not delve too deeply with the ins and outs of EQ (ie the casual player) mostly perceive the wizard as a player that mostly sits over in the corner and tries to joke a lot to keep people liking him/her.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm stunned by the number of awesome ideas posted here. Some goals:<P>1) Eye Candy - familiars, the pointy hat, new spell effects and better graphics. I want WIZ spells to strike their targets in a way that makes others stand back in awe!<P>2) Balance - We just need to be the Masters of something. Most seem to think it's damage, which is fine by me. But I would settle for being the Masters of mana management. True, AEs are under-used and have lots of potential, but only in certain situations and only with the right group. We need more than AEs. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
