</FONT><HR>Ok Absor or whatever your name is(Pardon my smugness), I think I'm being misled.  If I am not, then something really needs to be fixed man.  I'm a 50th level paladin from Druzzil Ro just so that you know where my point is coming from.<P>First of all, I'd like to say what I understood from Gordon and all that paladins are.  Paladins are a defensive tank and players who save the lives of others.  Now our damage is fine, a bit below par, but close enough to where we can deal with it; our true problem lies in defense.<P>Now Im not quite sure of the numbers, but I know our defense caps much lower than other melee classes.  I do not really understand how we can be a defensive tank and save others' lives if our defense caps so low.  I also think our natural AC should be a bit higher, we just get hit too darn hard for our defensive tanking to make up for our low damage.  <P>Recently I grouped with a monk 2 levels above me (I was 49 and he was 51) and god was I unsatisfied.  Now I have understood monks to be classes that cannot tank well but make up for it in MAAD damage.  This monk (and others that I have grouped with recently) just blow my tanking away.  Now I don't want to blow my own horn or anything, but I'm not a bad paladin and am not constantly told to taunt or anything of the like.  I play my paladin well and I tank well yet these monks blow my tanking away.  <P>I have a solution to this, please hear me out.  First off I was to say don't you dare nerf the monks ok?  If you are going to do something, balance the paladin class, DO NOT bring down other classes.  I think our defense skills need to cap higher (The number I keep hearing is 252, I could be wrong on this, however) and we need to have better natural AC.<P>These proposals would do alot for balance by bringing up the paladin class to the level of other meleers.  It will take care of what we lack and take care of you having to hear our 'crap' daily because we are unsatisfied.  <P>I'm sorry to throw this in, but I just must.  We are the customers and we are the ones who keep you paid and give you money to do what we do.  This money is to be spend bettering the game and making it an all around better experience for us, not for you all to hord while you knock our classes down.  We are the customers and the customers are always right, now we want to see some action taken to better our gaming experience!  Thanks for taking the time to read my post and I hope you are able to balance the classes effectively as I know this is one tuff feat.  Good luck and listen to the customers!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I just skimmed your post, so lemme just throw a few opinions and facts out there for ya...<P><BR>First, monks do not have junk AC.  In fact, monks have the highest AC in the game.  The only thing they *don't* have is HPs.  Give a monk some uber HP buffs and he'll out-tank a warrior without HP buffs.<P>Second, pallys have fine defensive skills.  I'd recommend 1) not fighting in such tough areas (cuz if you're in Seb, they WILL beat the snot out of you at 50), 2) get better gear, 3) Make sure you have cleric buffs.  All the tanks are getting much, much weaker, my friend.  When you see all those red numbers over 100 with very few misses, that is NOT abnormal.  I have a 55 SK with all blood ember except bp (yes, I have legs).  I use a shield and have generally uber stuff if I do say so my self.  Trust me, I get wailed on, too.<P>Third, you damage is NOT fine.  The number 1 reason people don't want pallys and SKs in groups is cuz their melee dmg is just miserable.  Pallys are a bit worse than SKs, but only because of the weapons available to them.<P><BR>If I were a paladin (and I'm a SK so I can very, very closely relate), this would be my argument...<P>Paladins and SKs are defensive characters.  I love this idea.  It's our specialty.  Defense.  Get a ranger/monk/rogue for offense and we'll tank for 'em.  SWEET.  We have a place in a group.  Oh, but wait!  There's a warrior.  He tanks better than I do.  He does a LOT more damage than I do.  Hmmm.  I have these spells, though.  I have heals (if I were a pally).  That should help, right?  Oh, but there's a cleric, too!  Doh!!  Cleric + Warrior &gt; (whatever out healer was) + Pally!  I'm hosed!  No group for me.<P>According to VI, hybrids are to fill two spots basically.  They are to fill in as tanks and casters.  Rangers are kind of a half rogue half nuker thingy.  Pallys are a half warrior half cleric.  SKs half warrior half necro.  The sad fact, however, is that no one in their right mind wants the half and half character.  They want BOTH of the real things.  (and no one really cares about the half-necro part of a SK anyway, so they'll just take the warrior and be done with it)<P>The other sad fact is that these classes are premanently hosed probably.  I commend Verant for their efforts in attempting to help the hybrids.  I think they're actually trying this time (unlike wizards who get screwed constantly).  There just isn't a good way to fix these classes.<P>My vote is this... If we are a defensive class, let us be the best defensive classes.  Let us have better tanking skills than the warriors.  No one wants to give up the best tanking for the second best, give up good damage for fair damage, and give up the most HPs (i.e. most efficient CHs) for a stupid line of utility spells that every caster in the group has anyway.  I mean most groups already have a snarer (there goes SKs), a healer (bye bye paladin), and a nuker (see ya ranger).  See my point?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hey, man, I'm not arguing with you.  I agree.  I was just kind of... enhancing your argument.  The monk comment was just a little FYI because that seems to be a common misunderstanding.  As far as your comment of "Play a pally and tell me this again" thing - I play a SK.  We have the same defense skills and every armor suit has *identical* AC on each piece.  The only difference between you and me is I play a troll so I may have another 50 HPs or so.<P>/agree Kalerien<BR>/cheer Kalerien<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is a disgusting post. I have seen several relatively anti-monk posts lately..<P>I'll put it to you this way.. It gets VERY hard for me as a monk to raise my AC any more than what it is now -  931. All the next level gear i can get is INCREDIBLY expensive, i go from my crappy no drop 4 ac boots to 15k+ Iksar scaled (or shivercrap, or the difficult to make, heavy black pantherskin), from my 15 AC RotLC/RotWF to the 40k Fungi scale tunic..<P>The monk life is hard enough, from being a non-equipment oriented class pre-kunark/velious, we have become one now... <P>-------------<BR>"Second, pallys have fine defensive skills."<P>Play a pally and tell me this again.<BR>-------------<P>I play an SK.. and they are ok, need a little tweaking but by pushing it to 252 would somewhat crosslines.<P>Just...

</FONT><HR>Kalerien,<P>Even though I have never played a paladin, at least not yet, you have my support.  In Role Playing, the Paladin is not the Warrior/Cleric as many people make him out to be.  The Paladin is a charismatic "Knight in Shining Armor."  The Paladin is the one that Bravely stands forward and attempts to rescue the little elf girl from the fire breathing dragon.  He is a Disciplened and highly trained warrior.  Well trained, a team player, with magical abilities given to him by the Gods to do good for others and to rid the world of Evil and the Undead that plagues the world.<P>HOWEVER, this game, by nature, is evolving into an EVERCAMP game instead of a role playing game.  One of those reasons is because of some of these specialty classes being imbalanced into these warrior/cleric or warrior/druid combonations rather then being respected for what they truely were meant to be.<P>How this equates to game development is, in my oppinion, but remember that I never played a Pallie, but I am on your side:<P>(1) Pallie should be able to kick.  A trained and disciplened warrior should be able to use every weapon and warrior skill at his disposal, assuming it does not go against his gods wishes.<P>(2) Pallies should only wear the finest armor, and the game should be set up with quests for you to earn them - kind of like the Monk Sash thing they got.  These quests should be set up so that each couple of levels, you can easily earn a new piece of shining armor.  (but of course, you can always BUY better armor.)  Your natural armor class should be the highest - EXCEPT for that of a warrior of course.  The warrior should be the "toughest of us all."  The problem with armor class is the inclusion of Agility.  Rangers should be the most agile class, but their natural armor class should not be more then a pally.<P>Your ability to do damage to evil creatures and the undead should be equivilent to that of a warrior.  You should also have some form of special attacks that you can do against these evil beasts.  For example I do not believe the orcs or gnolls are "evil" creatures in this world, just at war with the human race.  However, the dark elves and trolls are generally an evil race.  So if you are fighting a non-evil gnoll, then your damage is average.  However, when you are fighting an undead or an evil dragon then you should be doing maximum damage and also have some kind of suplimental attack against evil.<P>Your ability to do good is obvious.  you have healing spells, Buffs and the "lay of hands skill."  You should probably also be able to cure disease at higher levels.  I have no idea if you can or not.  <P>There should be more quests related to the "rescuing of the little elf girl from the clutches of the evil red dragon" concept in the game.  The only paladin type quests that I am aware of is donating money to the paladin guild, killing skellies for the bone chips and the killing of bandits for the sashes.<P>Well, for a non-pally, I have babbled on long enough.  In short, you have my support.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Frist off I don't understand what's going on in the heads of the makers of this game. Paladin's are defenders of the weak, of truth and valor. They are the strongest of all fighter's. Yeah right not in this game. In this game Paladin's are the weak. They have no purpose. Their not hybreeds. They are warriors of light the might of god. I've been playing paladin's and i can't believe how sad there attack is, and what is the deal with their defense???? Paladins are suppose to be able to take a hit, and deal one back with twice force just because something had the nerve to attack him. Something really has to be done about this. Either make the paladin right or just take out of the game all together. PS what's with the "beg" skill? Since when does the greatest warrior ever beg for anything.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>here here! for the monks  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif">.<P>Ok i really think all in this thread (save monk*ey boy) are very close to what i see as a viable option for VI.<P>1. Paladins should have best defense in game or at least equal to warriors. *NOTE: VI this will not make warriors obsolete as they will still FAR surpass us pally's in damage output. Following the defensive 'Knight in Shinning Armor' thread i feel: Kick, Duel wield are a NO for pally's, why would an honorable knight kick his opponent? <P>2. Sheilds should give ALL classes that have PARRY a bonus to that skill, then shields become even more useful than a bash and you might even see more war's with a shield (yeah right).<P>3. Protection from undead, AoE spell or ability that debuffs undead. (resit, str, atk, take your pick.)<P>4. Protection from evil, Group ressistance buffer like yaulpII but ressistance added to whole grp. Seen similar suggestion for warrior 'battle cry' to up grps attk bonus.<P>The only prob with the idea earlier in the thread for more damage against evil is that evil is not coded only undead is in scan code. (i.e. scans mob undead or no undead for ward line) all undead creatures have code saying 'HI IM UNDEAD' but other creatures have no code saying 'HI IM EVIL/GOOD/NUETRAL'</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alright! WTG gettin flamed for posting facts. Thanks!<P>No where did i say "Pallies suck" or other such.<P>So what would an SK get from this? The two classes are identical in skill caps.

</FONT><HR>Dran,<P>The issue here is Balance. Balance being equal in overall usefullness to a group(My interpretation of VI's meaning of the word). With that said the only way you can justify arguments about balance is to point out characteristics of other classes. Nowhere in this whole thread does anyone even remotely say that monks need to be nerfed or that monks are overpowered. The original poster merely stated some observations about the monks tanking ability and compared it to our own to justify his argument about a "plate" class having inferior tanking capabilities. All the post so far have stated that Paladins should have their tanking abilities raised not VI should lower the Monks.<P>As for the SK, yes it is badly underbalanced also. Not to the extent of the Pally but definitely needs improvement.<P>I guess my whole point is that I have seen your replies under a few posts and I get the feeling that you are misinterpreting the point of the posters.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I really don't know what a defensive tank is, that sounds like some PhD came up with that term.  As a Paladin, I am a holy warrior, Saving little girls and slaying evil wherever it is found.  I think Paladins should be just about as good as warriors in dmg output and defensive abilities. I totally agree with the Quests every few levels for equipment.  That would make this game Everquest again and not Evercamp.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bfason,  I don’t want to turn this into “You’re better than me” match but let me tell you something about SK’s:<P>1. Mana efficiency and spell utilization <BR>Paladin’s spells are mostly buff and heal oriented (with a little damage thrown in for good measure). Once you cast all your buffs your AC and Hp’s go up. This reduces the damage taken in a fight. The few offensive spells can blind a monster or even do a little damage to it. Paladins have lower down time comparing to SK’s. Also they are more mama efficient for the group’s healer/s. <P>SK’s “buffs” are more or less limited to “elemental” resistance (cold, disease etc). Not much in the way of increasing AC or HP’s. His spells are mostly offensive oriented. <BR>The offensive spells in question are low level dot’s. They do not cause great deal of damage. <BR>SK’s get “siphon health” line of spells with which to heal themselves. Most SK’s over level 30 that I’ve met stopped using those spells. They are slow to cast and not very mana efficient. <BR>Another spell that supposed to keep SK’s alive is “Vampiric Embrace”. It lasts about one minute. It’s also proc based, meaning it may go off once or twice in a fight, healing a few points (for example about 19 hps at 36). So this spell is just another spell window place holder. Very inefficient. I usually forget to cast it. <BR>SK’s are capable of Fear Kiting. But anyone who has done so will tell you that Fear doesn’t stick most of the time and usually breaks in the first couple of seconds in the higher levels.<BR>So the only real advantage that SK’s have is Feign Death. Lately I’ve noticed that most mobs will keep on chewing off my feet while I’m feigning death. So there goes that idea.<BR>The Siphon Strength spell and Steal Strength proc from the Dark Reaver look nice on paper. Reality is quite different. A mob hitting you for 70 hps will keep on hitting you just as hard after you have reduced it’s strength by 20+ points. It should be weaker and hit for a bit less but it doesn’t. <BR>With the added strength a SK can carry more but his damage output doesn’t seem to be affected noticeably. Pets are nearly useless. They are very incompetent and cause, at most, 40 or 50 damage during a fight (before level 39 pet). To low level players that may seem a lot but at my level it is a drop in a bucket. They do come in handy when the SK had enough and needs to make a run for it. The pet may (and I mean may) occupy the mob for a couple of seconds (literally, it is that weak) giving the SK a bit of a head start. Also since SK’s pet are so much lower than their masters they tend to attract all the “green trash” in the immediate area. In dungeons they are too much of a risk to use and can result in the deaths of the entire group if summoned.<P>So, paladin’s spells last a lot longer than those of a SK and tend to be more useful.<P>2. Acceptance.<BR>Groups will usually take paladins over SK’s. Paladins are more group friendly.<BR>Extra/buffer healer is always welcomed. An extra low damage dealer is not.<P>3. Tanking<BR>Thanks to their buffs paladins can last longer in a fright. <BR>SK’s are more dependent on other people’s buffs and heals than paladins. They are high maintenance class.<P>4. Taunting<BR>Here is one thing that I think SK’s are superior at: Taunting.<BR>SK’s can taunt an angry mob off a warrior when necessary.<BR>But what good is taunting when you can not take the damage?<BR>If the warrior, with his advanced AC and HP’s, can’t survive the mob what chance does SK have?<P><BR>In the end, I think Paladins get the better end of the stick.<BR>Why do I keep on playing a SK (especially human SK)? Maybe I’m a little masochistic or I like a challenge  or maybe I just need to have my head examined… The truth is SK’s are very rare and very unique.<BR>I bet there is more but my lunch break is almost over.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>DracoNoire,<P>I appreciate seeing you support the EverQuest -VS- the EverCamp argument some of us bring up.  <P>I believe this class balancing is suppose to be how our classes perform in a group together, with one class strengths picking up the weaknesses of another, in the group.  IMHO - This group balancing thing is about EverCamp.  And there is nothing wrong with people who rather camp from dawn to dusk for leveling and looting.  But VI markets this game as a massive online interactive RPG.  We should be able to play the hero or the villian.<P>I rather play EverQuest, where my ranger, stares across the plains of Karana (while hunting bandits or werewolves), at the shining helmits of a group of paladins (Trying not to laugh of course - Just Kidding  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ) that are off to rescue that poor little elf girl.  Mean while, I charm the bears and wolves to keep them out of the Paladin's way so that they are not harmed by crossing the group's path.<P>I find it interesting that many of you don't support the kicking skill for paladins.  Which is totally cool by me.  But I figure kicking is a combat skill that any fighter would want to use in combat.  But I can also see that a warrior that is as mighty as a paladin would have no need to "kick like a little girl."  But then again, it really hurts being kicked by one  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Bottom line .. In support of my Paladin Brethern - I am just bumping this thread so it is not forgotten.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Dranthor,<P>  Sorry bud I am a 51 cavalier with Deepwater bracer, helm, arms, gaunts, and boots, which is the best AC armor for paladins, plus I use a wurmslayer and a 25ac shield. And with MY buffs on I have 878ac. Now I have a monk friend who is also lvl51. When he is not buffed he has 906ac. Keep in mind that his monk gear does NOT have high AC at all and yet he still has more ac then my "shining armor" makes me have. And along with that monks can do 4 times more dmg to any mob and much faster than I can. Well I can cast alright, let me break out my spells.. hmm wait I dont have any offensive spells except the lvl50 flame of light spell which is a 125dmg dd that is resisted more then half of the time. Hmm my buffs still give me way less ac then monks have. Hmm when I cast my two stun spells on mobs in karnors or seb why.. they are resisted most of the time. Hmm my greater heal... I can cast this spell 6 or 7 times if lucky when I am fom... Each cast does 300hp heal.. Well needless to say I cant heal worth a darn either and I sure am not going to be grouped as a cleric. So what I am.. I cant deal near the dmg monks can I cant defend as good as monks and my spells are pretty much useless to a group or fighting the mobs.  OH but I got LOH baby! I got 2 lives just about! I guess I could use my flash of light spell and blind the mobs and create mass trains.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> Monks are like the necro caster in terms tanks. I do not want monks too loose any of their power but I tell you what if they do not fix paladins/sks/rangers then I am going to play Diablo 2 or maybe ILL get a life and hang out with my real life friends. <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>51 cavalier<BR>Bristlebane </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yup pretty much dunbar-however your GH does not heal 300hp, its actually 270(we get x2 penalty) approx ~+15%(i believe) on the mana cost and -10% on the GH itself(heals 270). And yes chain stunning is a mana burn,I never load up on +wis gear to squeeze a few highly resistable stuns because my AC drops thro the floor If i do. Fact is we have to be as sparing as we can with stuns or else its sit and med when we should be swinging-calling us 'master stunners' is a overstatement to say the least. While its undstandable we are not overly efficent casters, combine that with our terrible meelee damage and our high hit -miss ratio, its not hard to figure out why do many of us question whether we even have a viable role to fill anymore...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000602&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000602&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
