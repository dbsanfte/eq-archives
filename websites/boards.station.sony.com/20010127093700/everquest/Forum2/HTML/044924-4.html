</FONT><HR>Just a quick thought on downtime for dying.  I understand why the penalty is in place but, if the penalty for dying is supposed to be time lost (not necessarily xp), isn't that already in place by forcing characters to do a corpse recovery?<P>I don't have any high level characters, so, I'm not likely to get a xp res.  When I die I am forced to travel through zones, without equipment, dangerous enough to have killed me the first time to get my corpse and hopefully recover my equipment.  To add the extra time to regain experience seems like adding insult to injury.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I believe that you guys have done a very good job so far, but I also agree with the fact that the downtime is kind of a drag.  I think what would help would be to provide bind spots in certain areas that are not near cities for players.  It would still require melee classes to find a spell caster to bind them, but at least they won't have to travel an hour to get their corpse.  For example, South Karana isn't very close to any city, so let players be bound in a spot that is out of the way in the zone so that players would still have to travel a bit, but it would reduce their travel time by at least half.  From what I've seen, these new bind spots would only be needed in 3 zones or so.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I still don't see why it's necessary to turn melee's into beggers.<P>If you want to keep all melee's binding in cities can we at LEAST be allowed to buy a bind from an NPC?  I really HATE having to beg for a bind.  You could have an NPC shaman who stands outside every town who will cast binds, heals, and the standard assortment of shaman buffs (including SoW) for a small fee.   Wow - that would solve a LOT of issues.  It would shorten corpse recovery, make soloing a slittle easier, shorten overall travel time, allow melees to bind wihtout begging..... man.... I must be a genius.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You know, I personally don't really have a problem with the death penalty, when it is incurred in a dangerous area. But what really gets my gander is when I incur a major penalty because of really stupid things in what should not be a dangerous area.<P>Examples.<P>I was running thru Nek Forest from SolB at lvl 40. I had sow and invis up. Well, my invis dropped as I was nearing EC Zone. And guess what - there was a gooon there. And this is the time my service picks to send me to LD land. I come back, LVL 39, and can't find my corpse cause it's burried in a wall. Have to pay a necro to summon it cause the GMs say they jsut can't help me with CR.<P>I am lvl 45 and am heading to the bank. Well I recently went KOS with Freeport milita, so I invis and SOW and figure I will run to N Freeport zone (have not learned that there is a tunnel to get there at this point). Well, some militia guy was standing at the gate that could see thru invis (guess he had been pulled outa the Militia building), and before I can even turn around, those Ubber Gate guards have chained stunned me and cut me down. Oh well, I didn't want to go on the Kedge raid with my guild that day anyhow(yea, right).<P>Velious comes out, I am making my first trip there. I just made 49 so i am using my NEW wolfform. Boat pulls up to dock and a little green pirate hollars at me and starts to hit me. I run off over the ocean (I had lev on as well) and figurre I have lost him, drop the dog form, and get ready to camp out to clear the agro. Well, next thing I know I am double back stabbed for 581 points. Thats a total of over 1100 points. Well, no freinds around to help me, so it take me two hours to get back, as I was bound in Gfay.<P>My chanter makes level 34. Goes to Erudin and buys new spells. Instead of gating back to Kunark, decides he will ride the boat to Qeynos to do part of a quest. Sitting for 10 minutes really bored waiting on boat, so decides to try new spells. Cast new illusion 'fire elemental'  and sits back on little barge medding. Guards kill him, adios 34, and he is bound in OT. Oh yes, even though his home town guards can't tell he is a good guy through his illusions, the OT folks hate him no matter what spells and illusions he uses (no wonder everyone says not to have a god - it gets you nothing - and hurts you alot). So it's one heck of a long trip back to Erudin.<P>I am grouped with a warrior in FV. We are sitting near the zone tunnel to DL waiting on another person. Well, we decide to help these FV NPCs kill all those stupid spiders (a very noble thing to do). Uh Oh, warrior forgot his sword has an AE proc. Now the little green Private Goldtouch forgets about the spiders and goes for him. He runs for zone. Wow! That little green cleric can hit in the 400s. He dies.<P>None of these were risk vs reward related deaths. Every one is a stupid, BS death, that should have never happened. Everyone of these events cost the person involved a hell of alot of game time and experience for no reason. Gate guards should only agro on someone if they attack it or actually try and go into the city, green guards should not hit for 500 points. If your running away from the city, they should stop chasing you (they chase you into the woods and leave the city un-guarded? - thats pretty stupid guard AI), and Guards should lose their agro based on an illusion if you cancel it and you have not hit them or cast on them (Doh, I am sorry citizen, I thought you were a wolf. I had better get my eyes checked). Nothing has brougth me closer to quitting this game than stupid deaths to city guards.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR><BR>Brad, thank you for taking the time to post here and to read our responses.  Everyone I know who has quit this game for good (and I know quite a few of them) has done so because of one reason only:  the time commitment required.  Downtime is a huge part of that.  My comments here will focus on the penalties for death and the risk/reward concept, since that's where I think the game needs the most work.<P>Brad: "Because 'corpse recovery' allows us to add a variable to the death penalty. It's based on the premise that death in the depths of a dungeon should incur a greater penalty than death on top of a hill outside of a city. The depths of a dungeon should be a scarier, more risky place (and therefore, have better treasure) than, say, the top of a hill outside a city, and therefore dying there should be nastier. So while experience lost is the same regardless of where you die, the time involved in recovering your corpse is not, and neither is the risk you'll not get back your equipment."<P>...but later, when comparing EQ to AC, you say this:<P>Brad: "Also, EverQuest is a VERY item-centric game, and significantly increasing the chance of item-loss would turn out to be a much harsher penalty than what currently exists."<P>I submit that in a game as item-centric as EQ, a player should NEVER run the risk of losing every item they've earned up to that point.  When I was level 30, I zoned into Solusek's Eye for the first time, got in a group, and then immediately fell into the lava and ran around like an idiot trying to find an exit before I died.  I died three more times to lava and aggro goblins before I was able, with the help of some very generous groupmates, to recover my original corpse.  All this in exchange for the 'reward' of seeing a new zone and maybe a few gold pieces worth of loot.  The experience loss was bad enough, but if I had lost my corpse, I would have quit the game cold turkey rather than lose nearly a year's worth of achievement in terms of item acquisition.  I have also heard many horror stories about folks who have died and had to let their corpse decay due to real life demands.  Again, I would quit the game if that ever happened to me.<P>You have to be very careful when using time as a penalty.  Remember that time is a limited real-life resource that a player can never replenish.<P>Brad: "'Risk' fundamentally implies a penalty for failure. The greater the risk, the greater the penalty (and hopefully, the reward). IMHO, Reducing penalties doesn't encourage risk taking without also reducing the risk itself."<P>Yes, you're right.  The problem is that, as things currently stand, 'risk' is far far too great, penalties far far too harsh for the potential rewards.  Risk/reward is way out of balance.  No in-game trinket is 'reward' enough for the 'risk' of the several hours of real-life time necessary for a difficult corpse recovery, or the days, weeks, and months of real-life time necessary to regain lost items and experience.<P>I'll say it again because it bears repeating.  Time is a LIMITED real-life resource that can never be replenished.  In return for risking this precious commodity, you offer us the 'rewards' of items, experience, and the privilege of seeing new zones.  Think about this carefully before you tell me that it seems fair to you.  When I finally quit this game for another, this will be the reason.<P>Thanks for reading.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I would like to respond to the anti-social fellow and to some others who may agree with him.<P>Contrary to what people may think, this game is not about Loot, nor about gaining high lvls.  Doesn't it seem silly to work so hard for a virtual number 60 in a /who all?  This is just bits and bytes after all.  What makes this game fun is not the actual loot, but the process by which it is achieved and the feeling of overall success after a job well done.<P>If success is gauranteed there is no point in playing the game.  Simply dig out you D&D character sheets and write 1 billion in the hit points section and go to town.<P>The fun of this game is in making friends who you would not normally be able to make (I havent visited Europe in years, or even another state for some time) and adventuring in a local that we could not normal go to, with a persona we could not normally be.  Its escapism on a social scale.<P>Part of that is Guilds.  You join a guild, and adventure together.  Even camping an item with 2 or 3 friends is a lot of fun.  I recently took a paladin to help some guild mates camp the Ancient Croc.  No items there i needed, but i had a blast.<P>Part of that is downtime.  Yes downtime is a major factor.  It is boring and crap-tacular.  We want to avoid it.  Thus negative-renforcement.  We come up with new strategies, we play harder or smarter.  We make new friends to get the items we want... positive reinforcement for a job well done.<P>One person pointed out that little of what we learn in EQ is usuable in real life.  That learning good tactics was not transferable to real life.  Well... duh.  Its a game.  I guess however that life lessons are not worth ones time either... lessons like; Fair Play, Friendship, Economics, Problem Solving and Time management.  If an education is what you want from Video Games, they are out there, usually made by Matel.<P>This game isnt about loot that doesnt exist except on some magnet in the form of 1's and 0's.  Its about the people and doing stuff with them, yes loot is good, lets you do more stuff, drives you to get more things to do more stuff... its a cycle hopefully leading to fun times with those people.<P>And thats where things start to fall apart.  When a big string of bad luck plagues a group, or the "fun factor" starts to drop or worst of all, a player forgets this common goal of ours and gets greedy... we all forget the goal.  Verant's job, as a maker of a GAME and thusly and ENTERTAINMENT venue should be to maximize the fun.  <P>Really we just need more GM events where roleplaying is a factor in reward, and running from the lvl 60 named specter in oasis while waiting for the uber guild to show up is not.<P>The above example did happen on ECI, and happens all the time.  No plot, just lvl 50+ GM controlled mobs killing lvl 16 pc's.  There is plenty of risk for those hapless 16's, no reward.  <P>We dont need anything new in the mechanics.  We need something new in the staff.<P>Grimgroth<BR>Lvl 29 Magician (Dyrr), 22 Paladin (Grevance)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Kros:<P>  You are right, they were all stupid deaths.  How does someone get to 34 and not know that they would die from that Illusion?  Why did he forget about his AE proc?<P>I have had things happen when away from my bind point, and most of them have been stupid.  Not verifying I'm in chat mode before hitting that A while talking to an NPC, falling off a cliff, bumping into a ticked off NPC.  Each time it was "Man, that was stupid", but I don't blame Verant, it was the risk I took by not rebinding.<P>As for Melee binding, I think each city should have an NPC you can pay to bind you, really, as someone who has played all pure casters (except a rogue) I really don't make money for binds, and it's not a class defining function (Binding myself anywhere is) to be able to bind some poor Warrior at a city.  I for one don't see any problem with them being able to get their own bind in cities.  (I dont' think they should be able to bind anyplace new, just shouldn't require getting another player)<P>Finally, as I've stated before: Call of Hero, let it work on any groupmember from any zone.  It's a level 55 spell for goodness sake.  It's bad enough it got nerfed to a point it's not very useful inside the zone.<P>Now, imbalance problem: Mage gets into zone, runs invis to a special spot and starts yanking the group to him.  <P>2 things: <BR>1 at 55, what doesn't see invis?<BR>2 a mage live long enough without backup to get to that point... if He can do it, why not just bring the whole group in the first place? <P>Work as a TP:<P>  Not very effectively, and it's a one way trip.  I'm going to spend an hour traveling across Norrath to build a group, gate back and pull them to me?  I really don't think so.  It only works on group members, I don't see how it will really imbalance the game.  We are Mages, we summon things.  I always thought this spell should have existed from day one for around level 44.<P><BR>-- Fabmatil Fabulous<BR>   38 Mage, Tribunal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I posted this elsewhere, but it seems like it will get seen more here!<P>Brad has stated that downtime is an important game-balancing penalty portion of the game.  You want to try to avoid it.  Whereas I agree with the philosophy, I also think that EQ, as currently designed, has been built such that downtime is an integral part of the gameplay and hence, is unavoidable.  <BR> <BR>The most common suggested answer to reduce downtime in EQ presently is simply to get in a group.  While I agree that doing so does give the illusion of having less downtime, I think it is also necessary to point out that the total gross downtime when compared to the net gain of experience is really not that substantial.  In other words, while it is true that you spend less downtime between encounters because you have depleted your resources less in the previous one, you also gain substantially less experience.  Truth be told, downtime isn't really reduced, rather it is just spread out over many, many more encounters.<BR> <BR>Now then, this isn't intended to be a rant.  Rather, I want to look at some of the things that are causing downtime and suggest some design tweaks that I think would genuinely work towards reducing downtime in the game.<BR> <BR>First off, we have the time spellcasters must spend scribing scrolls into their spellbook.  I can see no good reason that this downtime needs to exist whatsoever.  Why force players to sit and look at a glorified egg-timer for a minute or so per new spell?  It serves zero gameplay purpose that I can ascertain.  I think that it should be set at a fixed 5 seconds or so per scribed spell.  Players would still need to memorize spells normally.<BR> <BR>Next, we have the issue of binding for melee classes.  Why not allow melee classes to be bound as freely as are the casters?  Melee classes would still need to find a willing caster to bind them but they could be bound anywhere it is legal for a caster to currently be bound.<BR> <BR>Now I recognize that corpse recovery is considered a necessary penalty for death.  But, as the game currently stands, melee classes are often penalized MORE for their deaths than are casters simply because of their inability to be bound as freely as are the casters.<BR> <BR>What about excessive travel time?  Why not introduce something like "touchstones" or fixed points to which players could immediately transport themselves.  Perhaps each player could have one and only one touchstone point active at any one time (much like a bind point).  Since players would need to physically touch one of these items, they would necessarily needed to have traveled there previously.  This would greatly help things such as long and boring boat rides between continents.<BR> <BR>These are fairly minor things.  For the big issues we have Health and Mana recovery.  I think that most of the players would agree that, in general, too much time is spent sitting down simply waiting for these resources to replenish.  I know of numerous players (and I am one myself) who often brings a book to read during EQ playing sessions just in case I get into a situation where I'm doing nothing but sitting around waiting for one of these two resources to recover.  <BR> <BR>I suggest that EQ seriously consider implementing Health and Mana potions into the game.  I realize that doing so could drastically change the way the game is played and so I think they should be introduced only under very carefully controlled conditions, which are as follows:<BR> <BR>The consuming of a Health or Mana potion by a player exactly follows the pattern currently in existence for casting spells.  That is, there is a little bar that says, "drinking potion" instead of "casting" when one is consumed.  Once the drinking time is complete, the effect fires off identically as though it were a spell.  If the player is interrupted during the drinking time, the drink and its effects is aborted (and the potion is even possibly lost for good with a message something like "You've spilled your potion!").  This would prevent them from too radically changing the complexion of combat.  You wouldn't get warriors who could reasonably drink a potion during a heated combat.  Remember, the idea here is to reduce the time spent sitting around doing nothing, not necessarily changing the way the game is played.  Heck, drinking times for potions could be double the current casting times for equivalent spells and they would still be highly valuable.<BR> <BR>Which is the next condition.  Health and Mana potions would (and given the current EQ economy) be quite expensive.  Perhaps costing 3s. per point of desired restoration.  A meager 50 hp restoring potion would thus run around 150 s. or 1.5p.  A bigger 300 point heal would cost 9p.<BR> <BR>The high cost would have two important effects.  First, it would help to prevent abuse.  Players who want to use them would know that they are darn expensive and thus probably only used occasionally when they feel that their current downtime isn't worth the wait for ordinary recovery.  Second, it would provide a much needed drain on the money supply in EQ.  As we all know, the older a server gets, the less and less money becomes valued.  Players with a lot of cash would now have something to actually spend it on rather than hoarding it up for that one rare item or, worse, flooding the newbie zones with insanely rich twinks.  <BR> <BR>Note that this would make soloing for some classes *that cannot currently do so* a reasonable proposition but only at a high monetary cost.  Personally,  I think that would be ok.  It would open up the game to another way of playing.  Grouping would probably still be preferred just because that 12p heal potion is essentially free if you have cleric in your party.<BR> <BR>And, if Verant is bold enough to consider implementing potions of this sort, it could also provide a whole new opportunity for a trade skill.  Potions could be made by players, again at a reasonably high expenditure of resources, and then sell them to others for a profit.<BR> <BR>That's it.  I would love to hear other suggestions on this post!<BR> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well if you ask me , theres nothing too wrong with the way downtime is done in the game. Lets start with travel.<P>You can usually get a port to either the zone or a zone or two away from where you wanna go, but saying you cant you then have to walk. And you know what thats fine w/ me , I walk from gfay to qeynos all the time ... this IS an RPG guys so therefore this trip taking you almost across the whole world that only takes about an hour to an hour half rl time is that bad. Sure it get annoying when your making this trip and get killed somewhere on it , but theres a couple places to get bound along the way.<P>As for corpse recovery, well its a fine idea .. sure itd be nice to be brought back w/ all your items and everything intact but we DO need some kinda penalty for getting killed. Now for the exp part , loosing exp is bad we all agree but its also something that HAS to happen , otherwise dieing wouldnt bother ppl at all. However I do not like the loss of a level from dieing.<P>If any changes should be made I think only 2 basic changes should be made and to be honest they come from Diablo. Make it so that you cant acctually loose your level from dieing but that you do loose all your exp for the current level if youve died that many times. And maybe (this idea isnt all that important but might make some happy) take cr like Diablo does too .. you can either walk there and get your stuff or log and relog and it will be in town for you. Now sure in Diablo if you take the easy way of logging all the monster npcs will be respawned and thats how they punish you for doing this ... but in EQ we'd need another way of doing it , perhaps loosing all the money on the corpse and if no money is present then 1 random item from the inventory (including items in containers)<P>Oh and before anyone says anything no Ive been playing EQ longer than Diablo and find EQ to be a better game</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm not sure this will ever get read... but after reading tons of other responses, I felt it the proper time to toss my $.02 into the mix.<P>I feel that the death penalties are too severe for a number of reasons:<BR>1. I'm an adult, father, and owner of a small business.  I have a limited number of hours to actually play EQ - so the time that I invest is very very important to me.  If I die, not only do I potentially lose hours of xps, but I then have to spend time retrieving my corpse, re-meming spells, etc...<BR>2. I pay Sony/Verant money every month.  I expect, as any loyal customer would, to have my needs not only listened to - but also fufilled.  I understand Verant's need to keep a balanced environment - but perhaps it's not as balanced as you would hope.<BR>3. The concept of penalty for death is silly unless you reward me for staying alive.  XPs are not a reward... I've earned those points through my character's hard work and effort.  Too many times I have thwarted death... killing a creature even to my level (at 30+) and loot it to find 3 copper or some other paultry amount.  Is this my reward??  Does this somehow constitute my just reward?  I could spend time killing Firebeetles for that kind of money!<BR>4. Imagine if Verant gave people the option of determining exactly which style of play they want.  Allowing people to opt for less penalty for death, or "auto resurrection". The game doesn't have to remain in balance for each person and should allow people to enjoy the game on whatever level they choose.<P>We are paying for this service, plain and simple. The world can still maintain the same fantasy adventure without penalizing people for having a life outside of EQ.  Time in the game should be spent playing... not running naked from your bind point.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Sree Treeheart<BR>48th druid Brell-Serrilis</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi!<P> Just my little take on risk vs reward vs "Downtime/Penelty".<P> I agree that you need to have more encourgement to for risky area. Personally, and I may be flamed for this, I would rather Loose 1/2 a level worth of XP each time I died - as long as I was garenteed that I would NOT loose my body or equipment.<P> Reasoning: I can sum what easily regain my lost xp, but if I lost my body and all of my equipment. Well, I would cancel that character. Especially at the higher levels. Who in there right mind would want to or really be willing to reget all of the equipment that you had if you died at as level 51 and you lost your body? The stuff you had was a culmanation of 51 levels worth of work!<P> Just my opion.<BR>   Larry</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;Yzona: "Conclusion: You need to encourage risk taking instead of actively discouraging it, and one way to do this is to reduce the penalty for it, which in most cases can be summed up as downtime."<P>&gt;Wow, one of best counter arguments posted, giving me much to think about - thanks. As for your conclusion, though, it seems to be contradictory. 'Risk' fundamentally implies a penalty for failure. The greater the risk, the greater the penalty (and hopefully, the reward). IMHO, Reducing penalties doesn't encourage risk taking without also reducing the risk itself.<P>--<P>I think what Yzona is getting at isn't that you should decrease the risk in every instance... it's that almost everywhere in the game... the ratio is seriously out of whack. My only expertise in the field of risk vs. reward is with my Enchanter, so I'll use him as an example. (This isn't a class envy bash... I know that every class has similar if not worse tales)<P>I can think of a single quest (that's right... only ONE) where my reward was worth the risk. And that's my level 44 Tash spell... I mean... it's a great spell, and the only way to get it is the quest, so you had to make it easy. (I got that spell at level 12) That's my one good example of risk vs reward. I died during the quest, and it took hours to do, but A) The reward was well worth the cost (in time, exp, etc) and B) I had fun doing it.<P>Illusion Iksar? ROFL this is a level 20 spell that has no practical use. The faction benefit of this spell is negligble and I needed to donate just as many bonechips to Trooper Whatshisface as Joe Necro. I died about 4 or 5 times and this was at level 34... that's right... i had to be level 34 to get a level 20 spell!<P>Sol Ro quest items? Good God! My wand was the last one I got because it was the hardest on my server (PvP) and then I discover that the Color Spray effect is a damn proc! Useless. That's 6 hours and a half bub exp I'll never get back. My mask? This is a GREAT item! Too bad I had to cheat (get my friend to mule one of the runes because I couldnt get it due to faction) to get it. Gloves? Not too bad... nice item, but I died a lot getting the items. Rod? If this item didnt have such a nice Charisma buff, I would have sold it off the moment I got it... By the time you can get this item, you already have the Benevolence spell, making the Alliance effect on it useless (since you cant alliance one faction AND benev a different faction at the same time).<P>Don't get me wrong, I love that I having these items, but the risk and cost I took and paid, was not worth the items themselves. The only reason I enjoy having them is that they are a status symbol displaying my stuborness.<P>And velious now! New Spells! Great! new 39 and 44 spells? AMAZING! Can I get them myself at the levels I can cast them at? No. They drop of wurms that /con blue to me, but have 15k hp, cast complete heals, and take a full group of 50's to take down... yipee, definately worth the risk (sarcasm =P) This means I have to buy the spells from players. Cuts down on the risk... but the overall time cost is the same at the price they sell for.<P>Now maybe enchanters are the only ones being picked on, but I'll give Verant the benefit of the doubt on that one =)<P>But this means that every class has examples like this. Not to mention the equipment that isn't class specific. Yzona said that one idea was to decrease risk. I think that would work, but is not likely to be an improvement over the status quo. What I think needs to be done is to re-examine peoples idea's of risk and cost (time lost) vs reward (time invested). It's obvious that the develepors' perceptions of this are vastly different than that of the players.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

While I also would not want to see every ranger running around with a Tolans BP and Greaves it is very disheartening that it is completely impossible for most of us to ever obtain them.<P>Shouldn't it, somehow, by great skill or very lucky chance be possible for a normal guild or just a group or two to obtain these things?  Not always, not even often, but shouldn't it be possible however rare?<P>Wouldn't it be nice to fight your way deep into a dark dungeon exceeding the odds of what your group of 6 or even 12 could do and miraculously come away with something wonderous and unexpected that may or may not every drop there again?<P>I think just opening the possibility, however unlikely, of some of this great equipment on mobs that can be handled by average size guilds with luck and great skill would do much to boost the morale of many of us.<P>Just my two cp.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Oh boy so much to work with! Thanks for replying Brad! Here are some quotes from Brads reply and my responses to them.<P>"Well, the death penalty continues to go up, but then we introduce the resurrection family of spells, which we assume will be used the majority of the time." - Brad<P>I got killed in OOT by Seafuries jumping on the boat and by the time I got a GM to summon my corpse from under the world and I got a nice cleric friend of mine to come to the dock, about 3 hours and 1 minute had passed so it was too late for a rez. I ate that one. <P>Remember Brad the saying, "When you assume you make an ass out of u and me". It is very cavalier of you to say and assume that the majority of people will get rezzes. 100% out of whack with reality.<P>"Halved the experience lost due to death." - Brad<P>I was there when you did this. This was done very early on I think about 3 months in. Now, image if you hadn't done that then, when since everyone was still low level, the % of exp lost equaled a smaller amount of exp. Everyone please imagine what it would be like right now if you lost TWICE the exp you do now. You think people complain now! I suspect VI realized the MONSTEROUS INSANITY of how much exp would be lost at high levels so they trimmed it down so that it was only INSANITY and not MONSTEROUS INSANITY. :P <P>Please change exp death penalty so you lose only the amount of exp you would have gotten if you had killed a black. The TRIPLE penalty on death is close to criminal in my book and many others (you knew that right?).<P>"I think I agree with the losing level part, and I'm going to debate it a bit with the designers (although even if we all agree, I'm not sure such a change to EQ would be practical). As for your other point, as mentioned, we do expect the majority of high level deaths to be mitigated by resurrection family spells." - Brad<P>EVERYONE CHEER! Brad will DEBATE losing lvl with designers!! Woot! /sigh But then he lapses back into insanity again by saying they expect the majority of high level deaths to get rezzes. Anyone remember Jim Morrison yelling "WAKE UP!!!"?<P>"I don't know for sure why this is the only mechanism [time invested] people have come up with, but it seems to be (at least for MMOGs). [...] But the other advancement mechanisms used so far in games [...] don't seem to be what RPG players want and/or simply don't work in an online persistent environment." - Brad<P>Look Brad "time invested" is a fine idea but you have stretched its use far far past its spirit. Try to think back on the thousands of posts you've read about how time penalties make people INSANELY FRUSTRATED. Then think about the word FUN. I would like to know what terrible consequences there would be if everyone had a lvl 60 PC. Your time-invested principle supposedly guards against this but why???<P>"Belrath: "Verant - you still have never directly asked me for my opinion on anything other than whether or not I want to renew my subscription. How do you know if I am happy? Do you view every active player as happy because they subscribe? You should poll your players A LOT and get demographics on who thinks what. All these blanket statements about how happy everyone is nonsense."<BR>I don't think subscription numbers and churn rates are at all 'nonsense' indicators, rather I think they are ultimately the best way to gauge the success of a product. But I do agree there are other ways to gather information and to learn how to make a better product, including polls. I DO think we should poll more often. Perhaps Absor could start a thread on what you all think we should ask our customer base via polls." - Brad<P>Hey that's the second time you've answered me, cool! You say that THE BEST way to guage EQ's success is through subscription numbers??? /vomit I would expect to hear that from an accountant or CEO maybe. Extremely insensitive comment. That is a terrible attitude to take. Takes everything the players post about here on the boards and throws it out the window. The correct answer is that the customers enjoyment of playing your game is THE BEST guage of the success of EQ. The problem is that you have demonstrated close to ZERO ability to guage customers enjoyment! You said that it's not about the money and then you turn around and say it's all about the money. Well which is it?<P>"I can also say with certainty that both I and all the other SOE/VI employees that post here and read these boards are interested in the responses and the feedback in general. We are listening, and we greatly appreciate the time many of you take to post." - Brad<P>Huge threads with well thought out posts go unanswered time and time and time again. I am the 99999 person to explain that. This is another statement that makes me question your sincerity. I don't really care if you are INTERESTED. It is your JOB! Listen to the voice of the playing community and then TAKE ACTION ON THEIR BEHALF. You need to CONVERSE with the players, not peer down at them from your tower from time to time. I hope your debate with the designers goes well.<P>There are some things we know you CAN modify in the game. We all know for a FACT that you can change the exp death penalty because you have already done it once. Do it again soon.<P>Getting weaker vs. the environment just totally blows my mind. It is SOOOOOOO wrong!!! I spent two years to get weaker. Great. There's one easy to spot way to take the fun out. Are you guys blind?<P>Another related thing. Players LOVE LOVE LOVE to explore. How about all those posts that talk about how great it was to see some structure for the first time. Yet you have managed to discurage exploration by making it VERY EASY TO DIE while going around. I cannot stress enough the relationship between exploring and enjoying a game. You have done your best to prevent this enjoyment because you feel exploring should be risky. When you see something new it is fun, that's all there is to it. <P>One last thing. I used to work at McDonalds.(hey no laughing!) My manager used to tell me that if any customer ever complained to immediately give them coupons for free food. Another words if they are unhappy go out of your way to make them happy. Why? Because they will come back and remain loyal. I think there is a good lesson for you in that philosophy. After hearing countless CS horror stories it is one you clearly haven't grasped.<P>Bottom line: BALANCE your time invested principle so that it is not so insanely out of whack with the REALITY of what the casual gamer wants and expects, then your players will be happy, PLAY MORE!, and remain loyal. Please save yourself from becoming like EA and UO. There is little time left!<P>Remember that Norrath is not a real world but the one we live in is. EQ is a game we play to have fun. Please make the game FUNNER as we level and not harsher and harsher punishments (err penalties) as we level.<P>Belrath</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You have said that there needs to be a penalty (EXP) to make the game 'feel' risky.  When I played at level 1, 2, 3, 4... ETC. I had the same fear of death as I do at the higher levels.  Now the difference was at lower levels I didn't lose enough exp to even make my bar move.  YET, I was so fearful of dying that it took me along time to explore.  And that was without much penalty at all.  <P>The only counter argument that I can see is that power gamers will exploit it... but really who cares, there is nothing much to exploit.  All we are talking about is a the 'fun' factor in playing the game.  when you work your arse off getting 1 bubble into 35 then die and lose youor level, it can make you feel rather upset.

</FONT><HR>Thanks for taking an interest Brad.<P>Something that popped into my mind recently.<BR>You mentioned several times that you prefer to get teleports when you can.  I think most people are in agreement with that for sure..but  <BR>Travel within Velious seems to be dependent on lvl 50+ players to the teleport spots other than those players could buy spells for.  Very few people on my server have found any TP spells recently.  (evidently they were dropping a lot at first, then the drops were nerfed)  Lots of people have travelled by foot to pick up keys at various TP spots, but have no use for them without the spells.<BR>I think everyone should have to travel to these zones by foot just to see them.  Most are laid out very well and are a wonder to see.  But running through them time and time again when you have TP'ers in your group who are without spells (I group mainly with sub 50's) is not a lot of fun.<BR>Please find a way to make TP spells more accessible to the sub-50 people ?  We are wearing our boots out !</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Lets not forget the other huge source of downtime, the assembling for a raid downtime.  Not everyone in EQ belongs to a large guild, despite the fact the latest expansion seems designed for those players that are, and assembling groups to take on these new areas is a HUGE source of downtime.<P>I think a lot of that is attributable to the clunky communications interface.  What's easier, trying to organize a group of 30 players using guildsay or through using tells?  <P>Anyway, it isn't atypical to have several hours of assembling forces followed by a couple of minutes of actual encounter, followed by (if things are bad) several hours of CR, which usually means a couple people doing things and dying over and over while everyone else waits.  Not exaggerating here, I've seen it happen.  Myself I've had my character dead in Fear for days on end waiting for an uber-guild to break fear so that I do CR without risking multiple deaths.<P>And if that doesn't discourage high level players from the Epic encounter in Everquest, then perhaps repeatedly dying, having multiple corpses expire before CR can be completed.  I can't tell you how many times I've heard of this happening especially on Fear raids, because there's no strong incentive for Clerics to go to Fear, just like there's not a terribly compelling reason for druids to go to Hate -- not that anyone really misses the lack of druidic presence in Hate. <P>I am really sad to see that most of Velious is going to be off-limits to me and my friends, because we do not belong to large guilds that can handle these encounters.  And also sad to see that we won't be seeing our Velious spells, because again, they're planted on mobs that we can't take out with our un-uber groups of druids, paladins and rangers... <P>Did you really intend for everyone post 50 to have to join a large raid guild in order to experience Velious?  I won't even talk about how difficult it is for certain classes to get into large raid guilds because we are seen as superfluous to raids or ... oops, I'm talking about it.<P>Well, there you go.  The non-uber guilded are especially challenged when it comes to downtime because we don't have have the communication facilities to rapidly form a raid like a large guild does.<P>I'm feeling very left out in the (sic) cold when it comes to Velious.  Its a shame, because at first look it was really cool.  Now after the initial exploring and poking about is done, I'm seeing there isn't much of any content there for me and my un-uber buddies.<P>Maybe Verant has gotten too concerned over providing high-level content to the top 10% of the players and have forgotten about the rest of us schlubs who have slowly worked our way past 50 and are now wondering what we can do in our groups without enchanters and clerics (they're all in the uber-guilds for the most part).  If we die without a cleric onboard we risk possibly many weeks of work to regain our experience.  Sure, we have cleric friends, but the cleric ratio isn't really high enough to avoid the unressurrected deaths. There aren't enough clerics for all the groups that need them.  <P>I think the problem with raid downtime could be alleviated in part by providing better communications for folks not in the same guild. (ooc, shout don't cut it, that's only zone wide).  Raids would also be more fun if there was a means to share experience across multiple groups.<P>This won't win me any friends, but I think a lot of the encounter-inflation is caused by the really large raid guilds.  They get the best gear, the highest level characters, and lots of them and they can overwhelm most of the encounters.  So the game gets tougher for them in expansions, yet way out of reach for the rest of us.  <P>My solution would be to either remove guilds from the game, limit their size, or else figure out a way to add additional communications to everquest (like ICQ channels) so that everyone can experience the advantage that large guilds currently have in organizing large campaigns.<P>I know a lot of the faults I'm currently finding in Everquest are probably not solveable in this game.  But Verant needs to remember us schlubs and give us some new content too.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here are a few more ideas to reduce some of the travel downtime:<P>1. Pay per use porting service where users pay a fee to an NPC to be TP between portals. Make it high enough that it would still be attractive to get the service from PCs, but players would know they can always get a port.<P>2. Offer premium service boats that would simply zone from one dock to the next for a price. Kinda like taking the Concorde from NewYork to London.<P>I will probably get flamed for these suggestions to the tune of "that just makes life easier for the uberguilds" or "it creates a divide between the haves and havenots", but I am not talking about fees in the 1000's, but ones that would make it difficult for low levels to use regulary yet still be more practical at higher levels.<P>3. Add zone based "outpost" banks that give players the ability to store money in goods in that zone only. It would not give access to the "town" banks and items. That way players could dump items off their character without having to travel long distances to town banks. Running back and forth between Dalnir and FV comes to mind here.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I was on a vox raid and crashed.  had to reinstall eq(sound card issues), as a druid i was bound at bind rock(bad place to be bound if for some reason you crash) died 15 times in a loop. I dont petition because if you cant prove it it didnt happen. but i lost 11 bubbles of exp in the loop and successive corpse recovery(corpse recovery part was on me got frustrated <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">) cant get a res due to time dead and corpses poofed.  BIG Penalty for tryin to be a part of the verant social vision. <BR>P.S. for those that wonder why i didnt /quit- This was before my cable modem when i was ruinnin a 233pent with 64 mg of ram.

</FONT><HR>Dark_Horse Posted:<P>"All we are talking about is a the 'fun' factor in playing the game. when you work your arse off getting 1 bubble into 35 then die and lose youor level, it can make you feel rather upset. And I think I can speak for everyone here when I say, VERY upset. Anyone else want to through your PC out the window?"<P>I for one have been there.  Death is fare to costly.  It is bad enough to have to spend 30 mintues meming spells, getting your corpse back, dragin it somewhere, and looting your stuff of it, and then earning back the exp you lost (when in your low teens) and this is probably apropriate.  On the other hand, losing a full week of play time when you die is pure frustration, not fun at all, and does make you have a screaming desire to put a bat in to your monitor, but then you think of the costs, walk away from everquest.<P>You then dont play for a few days cause your pissed off at the game, and then you decide to go back for some more becuase you just cant walk away from the investment.  You have some fun for a couple of days, and then do it all over agian...<P>Oh now let me think did not they say "That's right, casual gamers, we make the most money off of you! *evil cackle*"-Brad<P>Guess the down time does make us more casual gamers than we would be if it was not so dam painful.  Keeps us away for a few days at a time.

</FONT><HR>One possible way to make downtime lessened, take away the problem of dropping to level45 with a corpse in the planes, and to effectively stop those endless dying cycles is to make level loss impossible. Thus, you could lose xp to a point where you had none in the current level; but you wouldnt drop three or four levels from being bound at a death point, or fear of corpse loss, whatever. Maybe make the xp loss harsher to compensate for this; sure, I lose more, but at least my level is permanently mine. I know I would rather hace it this way myself...

</FONT><HR>My personal counters.<P>----------------------------------------------<BR>Well, the death penalty continues to go up, but then we introduce the resurrection family of spells, which we assume will be used the majority of the time. Also, mana regeneration and other spells are introduced to compensate for the increased mana costs and total mana a character may have.<P>**You ASSUME they will be used a majority of the time. (OK everyone do we know what happens when you assume?) Well from a broke warrior I can tell you that they wont get used.  <P>**MOST clerics wont just do a rez for you.  Why?  Well most of the time any cleric in a zone you died in is going to be in a group, If you need a rez you cant always get the corpse to them and most arent willing to leave their group to come to you.  Even if you can take your corpse to them their are still enormous mana (which will cause downtime hence you put a penalty on them and their group)  <P>**So what happens in the reality of EQ?  They want a form of compensation for helping you, which ends up being money, on Povar (inflation server from what I hear) I end up getting requests of 50-100pp per rez)  I am not twinked and I guess Im considered a casual player because I do play a lot but I dont ever seem to get anything done.  (18 months of play and my highest char is 41 warrior)  I know your repost to this is make more friends to get a rez, well I do have a few friends and guildmates that *can* rez, but it IS a big world and even if it wasnt they are playing for fun as well and spending an hour to get to your corpse is not what they consider fun  (espically when the guild has LOTS of players dying... if this always happened our clerics would always be chasing down corpses... some fun for them)<P>----------------------------------------------<BR>We've really tried to get the boats running smoothly and as fast as is reasonable, but they ARE there as a means by which we make the world larger. We feel it should be time consuming to travel from one continent to another. If it was a similar trip from one zone in one continent to another as it was from one zone to another across the ocean well, I really think that would diminish the immersive nature of a virtual world. <P>**This one is easy but I know you wont do it.  It only takes two words to describe it (though I will use MANY more) Teleport pads.  You guys seem to think that by making us ride these boats and walk through zones you increase how we perceive your world.  Well it doesnt do that... aggrivate us heck yeah, but thats about it.  So then you say get a teleport right?  (wow you must think im psysic)  Well in response to that read the above only replace cleric with druid/wizard and 50-100pp with 10-50)<P>-----------------------------------------------<BR>Since launch, we've:<BR>7. Enhanced High Level (35+) Meditation<BR>8. Reduced many spells' mana costs<BR>9. Added Summon Corpse<BR>11. Given more classes resurrection family spells<P>** Well there are a couple of things in here to dispute but first the one to me that is blatenly obvious.  WHERE IS THE REDUCTION IN DOWNTIME FOR HP BASED CLASSES?  Casters get meditation, increased meditation at 35, reduced mana costs on spells (specialization)....  OK so how about something for the melee based classes?  (and if you say those spells are for the casters to heal/help the melee and point out how patheticly and utterly dependant the melee classes are on casters Im going to jump through my cable modem and smack you upside the head)  <P>**Melee are dependant on casters for corpse retrival (invis), Travel (sow and teleport), Binding (Bind affinity, only allowed in cities GRRRRR but Ill discuss that later), Death exp recovery (Reserection spell line), Doing absolutly anything after 30 (Basicly melee have to get a group or kill things 20% lower than their level), and of course Downtime (healing).  If casters get meditation, increased meditation, and reduction in spell costs (specialization) then why in gods name are we stuck with the same regen at level 10 as at level 50?  Melee classes need to have a skill of fast regeneration.  <P>**This skill would work like meditation only it would kick in after we have been sitting down for more than say a minute.  After that first minute we would regenerate at about twice our normal rate Considering all that caster classes have this is totally fair.  It would not be able to be used in battle so the only time it would help is during long downtime.  When the group your in takes a bad hit and all the healers are OOM and your sitting on your butt you wouldnt have to wait through the extra time of them healing you and getting back that mana also.  It would also help when your traveling and you get attacked and barley make it to zone you wouldnt have to wait 25 minutes to get back to full health.  Also it would allow us to solo small creatures  (trust me at least with my warrior, any fight that would give me experience worth mentioning I still wouldnt come near the exp in a group becacause if I try to solo anything within 7 levels of me I will die)<P>**As for the other two mentioned details above Summon corpse has components that make the spell all but useless except in raids and places like Veeshans peak.  So that spell is only good for a small fraction of circumstances (and im sure most of the players will never have their corpses summoned so dont try to put it off as this great thing given to us)  As for the rez spells.... see the above mention of clerics and why we cant get rez's most of the time like you ASSUME.<P>------------------------------------------------<BR>Terrak_Steeltalon: "Well, I don't think that the exp penalty concept in and of itself is too bad, but it's how it is executed. Death at the high levels doesn't cost you a few hours if you don't get a res, it can cost you days or weeks worth of exp. That's really just not fun and I think that needs to be softened. Also, like others, I think it's a real downer to lose a level due to death."<P>I think I agree with the losing level part, and I'm going to debate it a bit with the designers (although even if we all agree, I'm not sure such a change to EQ would be practical). As for your other point, as mentioned, we do expect the majority of high level deaths to be mitigated by resurrection family spells.<P>**If you guys did make it so we could no longer lose level from death you would make yourself very popular.  On the multiple user dungeon that i use to play players DID lose exp, sometimes hours depending on your level, still not as much as high end eq but still)  The point is that Death penalty was acceptable because you never lost level.  Death penalty was very rarly ever brought up as a complaing on the message board and when it was, the poster was usually new to the game.<P>**As your second part of that response where you mention the reserection spell line... I would yet again like you to refer to the first part of my repost and read yet again the cleric/rez seciton.  Thank you.<P>------------------------------------------------<BR>I definitely agree with you, but honestly, it's easier said than done. I think going forward this is a very real goal: provide other activities when downtime is incurred - the player should never be doing 'nothing' (btw, though, I don't consider socializing 'nothing').<P>** I dont play EQ to socialize.  Yes I do socialize, very much so in fact.... but that is not why I play EQ.  I play eq for the GAME part of it.  The action mostly, collection of items, and the kewl kewl graphics (the graphics are my favorite part of eq and probably the only reason I havent switched to another game.... besides I would hate to think I wasted my time playing and for some odd reason have a glimmer of hope that you will see the error in your ways and make some major changes)  I do end up spending more time socialzing than I do fighting and such.  The socializing should be an added bonus, not what I end up doing most.  If I wanted to chat all the time I would still be playing on my old multiple user dungeon (MUD).  I changed to EQ because of the graphics... and I spend more time watching the text than I do looking at the awsome graphics.  This definatly needs to change, you guys should be helping us to see all of your wonderful graphics, not standing with your heals on the ground telling us how we should play/group/use tactics and its our own fault if were not.  Graphics are one of your strongest points in my opinion, put them to good use!<P>------------------------------------------------<BR>That's an excellent point, and why we feel the melee binding issue is a balance issue for all classes, and that were it changed the entire pace of the game would change also. In other words, the fact that melee classes cannot self-bind and must bind in city zones is part of the death penalty for both melee classes AND non-melee classes.<P>**You said in this post that melee binding was a balance issue.  Helping everyone is not a balance issue (unless you say it overbalances the players from the environment.  IN that case I say <BR>1)the environment has more than enough compensation.  If you dont completely agree with me then you need to take a sabatical to Velious.  <BR>2)The environment is not paying you, we are.<P>**Melee being able to bind in ourdoor zones would only reduce the time to get our corpse.  Our group would still be out of action, lose the control over the spawn, and still have to send someone to the entrance of a dungeon to invis us so we can get back to the group.  Trust me there is more than enough penalties.  This one is just annoying.  <P>** You guys constantly use the downtime issue and keep throwing it in our faces.  We have EXP death penalty downtime, fighting downtime, travel downtime, traveling to your corpse downtime, EXP Penalties on certain classes/races, and lack of exp for what we do (what I mean by this is considering how hard things are, espically down in velious, I dont believe you give out nearly enough exp per kill)<BR>------------------------------------------------<BR>Because 'corpse recovery' allows us to add a variable to the death penalty. It's based on the premise that death in the depths of a dungeon should incur a greater penalty than death on top of a hill outside of a city. The depths of a dungeon should be a scarier, more risky place (and therefore, have better treasure) than, say, the top of a hill outside a city, and therefore dying there should be nastier. So while experience lost is the same regardless of where you die, the time involved in recovering your corpse is not, and neither is the risk you'll not get back your equipment.<P>**The creatures in a dungeon ARE harder to defeat, not to mention they are more tightly packed so you end up taking on more 2+ fights in a dungeon.  THAT is the extra risk you take in a dungeon, or should be, and in most cases i have seen does justify the treasure.  The added fact of having downed group, melee classes traveling back to that zone (and possibly dying on the way) is added onto the fact that you have to get back to your corpse in a dungeon with harder creatures more tightly packed.. is like taxing us for the same item multiple times.  <P>------------------------------------------------<BR>Because we expect the majority of time the ratio of NPCs killed to you dying to an NPC to be significantly in your favor. In other words, many more NPCs die than players in most adventures, and so a single death needs to cost the experience gained by killing many NPCs.<P><BR>**OK I just got done laughing in real life.  It took me 2 months to get through level 35 with my warrior because of the deaths I encountered.  One day I died five times.  One death on my own (I didnt run from a barly blue that found me...), One death in Dreadlands, two extra deaths trying to get back to my corpse in the dreadlands, and one death in a group in Overthere later that night.  I played the entire saturday (about 12 hours I believe, minus meals and ciggaretts) and I was down 2 bubbles of exp from when I started.  Not a single exp rez that day  (I was broke and between guilds at the time)  I havent wasted an entire saturday since then.  I guess I learned something but it was a negitive experience I now associate with Everquest, it along with other similar experiences leave a bitter taste in my mouth.<P>------------------------------------------------<BR>I don't know for sure why this is the only mechanism people have come up with, but it seems to be (at least for MMOGs). I sure don't like to 'think in a box', which is one of the very reasons I created this thread (to get feedback and hopefully new ideas for the future). But the other advancement mechanisms used so far in games (pure luck, actual real life skill and dexterity ('twitch'), puzzles, etc.) don't seem to be what RPG players want and/or simply don't work in an online persistent environment. I'm all ears if you can think of a better one that would really work - heck, if you can, please email me and we'll definitely talk  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>**Well its not exactly what this post is saying, but its where I will interject something I think your missing.  It has been posted (Brad I think?) that MMORPG's are time based, and you are constantly throwing the time lost issue as a reason for the many downtimes I listed previously.<P>**Your missing something.  You do not judge our gain in levels in time!  If you do then I plan on seeing the next patch say "We now give exp for everything you do in the game"  If this game was entirly based on time then I would get experience for chatting with my guild, giving out newbie quests, learning and using trade skills, traveling to new zones, and helping others in need.  The simple fact that we do not recieve experience in this field is why your time based reasons for advancement are void and null.<P>** Our gain in levels is determined by our class/race combonation being a 'powerful' class or combination of class race.  By our ability to find people to help us gain experience.  By the killing of NPC's in the game, and by the quests we turn in.  Since we only gain experience for these things time can not (acceptably) be used as the justification for all the losses and downtime in the game.  <P>**What do we use then?  Your probably asking this, and I cant answer that.  NOBODY can answer that, at least they cant answer it and be right for every person.  There is no answer and thats what you have to realize.  The ONLY way for you to find an answer is by change, experimentation, and MOST importantly imput from your customers.  This is probably the most important part of this post.  You guys have to realize that you cannot stick to formula and visions and policy or the game will continue to grow stagnant and fall apart.  The fact that this type of post is so heated and important to us costomers should really prove this to you. <P>------------------------------------------------<BR>Alcarian: "Again, I reiterate: I don't play EQ to 'learn good tactics'. Why would I do this? Where would I ever use these 'tactics' except in this game for powergaming? Will you now tell me that learning 'good tactics' and how to form the most 'efficient group' is somehow a public service provided by VI--for RL situations?<P>I play a game such as this to have FUN. I am willing to pay for it--up to the point I find the first game out that deals with my complaints. There isn't one, YET. But there will be. And, until VI gets it together and starts addressing my 'fun issues', then the doom of ultimate cancellation looms on the horizon (no pun).<P>By telling me that downtime penalties are in place to force me to 'learn tactics' and 'form efficient groups', you are, in effect, telling me: be a powergamer or suffer."<P>With all due respect, I totally disagree. Discovering effective tactics, playing smart, and being efficient don't make someone a 'powergamer'. That's like saying a casual gamer is somehow unable to use good tactics and operate efficiently in a group - I don't buy it.<P>** I think you missed the forrest through the trees on that post/response.  Most of us dont play the game to learn tactics and find things to do during downtime.  We play it for fun, when people dont find it fun you need to reconsider forcing us to do things your way.  I cant tell you how many times Abashi/Absor/otherbluenameshere have refered to 'the vision' or 'policy' as a reason for not doing something.  Also along the same lines, downtime for solo classes is talked about almost as punishment for you chosing a solo class (though I dont know if anyone ever AUCTUALLY said it that way, it is implied)  They have said the encourge us to group, I believe it is more accurate to say you try to FORCE us to group.  Since we pay you, shouldnt we chose what style we play the game and not be punished/encouraged/forced to play it YOUR way.  Im sure most people dont enjoy always doing things other peoples way.<P>------------------------------------------------<BR>Oh come on, many, many designers have played multiple race/class combinations to high levels, without twinking, and by making friends with players who don't work here. And yes, we ask players for binds and SoWs, and yes we often find clerics for our groups, and yes we wait for boats at times (although I prefer to make friends with people who can teleport me). Hrm, and no, I doubt we run 12 zones to get our bodies unless we have a brain fart and forget to bind where we should  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>**Not really a repost... just a complaint.  Your programmers went way to far on the faction for the reduction in faction gained in velious.  I dare them to try and switch cities to the giants with a melee class between levels 35-40 with a warrior.  Remember that warriors can only bind in a city, and since the faction is so far out of wack between what you gain and lose, you will spend MANY MANY hours (for me weeks due to lack of find groupmates willing to kill dwarves at most times) that if/when you die, you are trapped ina  city you are KOS.  Again this was just a complaint please dont let it reflect the rest of my letter... but its got me to the point I almost quit because of it.<P>MOVING ON SORRY FOR THE INTERUPTION<P>------------------------------------------------<BR>I don't think subscription numbers and churn rates are at all 'nonsense' indicators, rather I think they are ultimately the best way to gauge the success of a product. But I do agree there are other ways to gather information and to learn how to make a better product, including polls. I DO think we should poll more often. Perhaps Absor could start a thread on what you all think we should ask our customer base via polls. <P>** I have not been 'happy' with EQ and espically Verant in QUITE a while.  You do need polls because you have no idea the dis-satisfaction running rampant in the game (at least not until you (arudane) started asking)  The only thing still having customers proves is that you are still profitable.  And I suppose if thats the only thing that matters, then you are doing fine, but I really hope that isnt true.  I cant always explain things well so Here is a person and post who said exactly what I was thinking for a long time.  He says it all very well.<P>Station name= Hawthorn13<BR>Title of post= To VI CS, I am quiting EQ today. Here is my reasons why. <P><BR>------------------------------------------------<BR>'Risk' fundamentally implies a penalty for failure. The greater the risk, the greater the penalty (and hopefully, the reward). IMHO, Reducing penalties doesn't encourage risk taking without also reducing the risk itself<P>** Sheesh.  Have you played in Velious?  The 'risk' is that the creatures get more and more difficult.  You dont need all these penalties.  The dificulty of the game is more than enough penalty.  If I could only make you realize you infuriate us with these penalties combined with the dificulty of the game (espically with Velious).  The dificulty is just fine, its the penalties that are killing us!  There is a thin line between challenging and frustrating, all these penalties (travel, downtime, death, lack of exp, losing level, getting to your corpse during death) have taken you many MILES beyond that thin line.<P>-------------------------------------------------<BR>I think you've got a good point there. The majority of content in EQ should definitely be targeted at a solid group (4-6 players). Then should come the really difficult stuff, requiring multiple groups, as well as content for people who prefer soloing. Recently, as we've focused quite a bit on higher levels and very difficult challenges, we've also added a lot of multiple group content. And while this in and of itself is definitely not a bad thing, in the future we'll make sure more single group challenges are added, as well as content for all level ranges, more playing styles, etc.<P>** This kind of mentality is killing us casual players.<BR>-----------------------------------------------<P>To end this post I will give some general advise.  First off dont ignore your customers.  If we overwheamingly say something that doesnt agree with your vision, policy, intent then listen to us and do something about us.  And just saying "We care, we listen, we will look into it" just isnt enough.  DO something with the feedback we give you, dont try to convince us of why we dont really want that or are mistaken.  Melee binding, forced grouping, forced downtime, death penalty, and all of the other 'closed topics' are prime examples of you not listening to us.  Learn from your mistakes and save this promising game while you still can.  I have already lost too many people to the "Cancel Account" button, I dont want to join them, but its beginning to look inevedable.<P>OH and last note, make sure and read that post by Hawthorn13.   Its exactly what I been thinking (at least his original post)<P>--------------Travis</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The fundamental advancement mechanism in MMORPGs is Time Invested; therefore, Time Lost needs to be the fundamental death penalty if the principle of risk vs. reward is to be preserved.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;Yup, yup, yup....&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>The time lost can be in the form of experience loss, an experience debt (a cool idea, btw), items lost (providing it takes time to acquire items), corpse retrievals, etc. <P>&gt;&gt;&gt;Aye. Although when you consider the amount of time invested most of EQ's population puts into the game, you'd think that there would be perhaps a bit less of a penelty. I always thought you lose a tad too much xp in EQ; perhaps a small change in what's lost is warrented? Even something in the ballpark of 5-10% less would be great. Nice thing about it is that it would benefit everyone, and so be free of class envy. (Which is why I don't frequent these boards much.)&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>As a corollary, being efficient in terms of time spent is the quickest way to advance (assuming advancing quickly is your goal, of course). Downtime, which is likewise often debated and criticized, is also a penalty based on the Time Invested/Time Lost principle. Minimizing or even eliminating downtime using intelligent tactics in a well-balanced group is an efficient time investment. Failing to do so incurs a Time Lost penalty, though probably not as severe as dying.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;Perfectly ok with this. This, however, is a double edged sword; group "skill" and group "selection" get mangled together rather frequently. Ideally, you'd like, say, a Paladin, Ranger, Shadow Knight, Bard, Mage, Shaman group full of SUPERB players to be at least somewhat equal to a group with a Warrior, Cleric, Enchanter, Wizard, Rogue, Druid, Bard. All mediocre-poor at their jobs. Correct?<P>If this is so, (And we being 2 different people, it probabally isn't.) that's all fine and dandy on paper. Apply this to "real" EQ life then. Let's say you're in post-50 "life". Is it not true that the people you are playing with better be pretty damn well good to their class, and EQ in general? "Skill" can be gathered by everyone, picked up by everyone. However, defense caps? Disciplines? Lure resistant spells? You cannot change those; they are FIXED. This is the problem with post-50 life; there are simply too many skilled players! Skill becomes less important since there is more supply of it; class specific skills, spells, and equipment is not. There's a reason there's a lot of Warriors, Clerics, and Enchanters in Norrath: The smart people dumped a previous primary in favor of a more "useful" class.<P>How does all this figure with Risk vs. Reward? You've got to include your class selection into the Risk. If you're a Cleric, you are at very little risk to not get a group. If you're a Shadow Knight on the other hands? That's quite a bit of risk. This doesn't just apply to group aspects either: I feel for Druids and Necros moaning about their lack of usefullness in raids. But they can make up for it in solo. See, risk vs. reward in effect: You sacrifice usefullness at groups for usefullness at soloing. It's the classes in the middle you have to watch, with dubious risk vs. reward choices. Let's take a Ranger. Post 50. Can you solo? Possibly, using weak kiting techniques. Can you group? Possibly, but you really, really need a better Tank+Healer combo to keep you running. This person took a big risk in choosing versitility over specialization, and he doesn't get much reward out of it.<P>My deepest apologies if it sounded like I was sliding into class envy...it was not my intent.&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>-Brad<P>------<P>Seriously, as I posted recently, downtime is most often used as a penalty (for death, inefficient grouping, etc.). A challenge within the game, therefore, is to be efficient and to minimize downtime.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;Indeed.&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>This isn't as applicable to travel (well, unless you consider teleportation spells), but please realize that there is a balance we've tried to achieve between tedium and losing how big a world feels and the sense of accomplishment from travel.<P>This probably opens up a new area of discussion and debate, that being how does one create a virtual world in an MMOG that is large, where exploration is important, where players feel accomplished after traveling great distances, yet isn't tedious when it comes to frequent traveling....<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, unless you want to dole out more class specific spells (Like SoW, TPs, binding.) I'm not entirely sure what you can come up. I should probabally read this thread for some, but with a 100+ posts I don't exactly feel enthused to look them over. I'm sure you feel the same as well. :-)&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>In a recent discussion an example came up: Frodo traveling to Mount Doom was exciting and perilous the first time, but if he had to go there over and over again, it would get tedious. So, is it possible to set up a system such that the fun and accomplishment of traveling to that far away, exotic land is maintained, yet repeated travel isn't tedious?<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;That's a great analogy, and is the crux of the traveling problem.&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>I think we got closer to this goal with the way the dragon teleportation works in Velious...<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;Haven't quite gotten there myself, but somewhat sounds like it. ;-) I liked the idea of Kunark teleporters too; you know, like the ones that run under FV, and in various Caster guilds? There should be more of those in the game, whether it may be via a quest for enough faction or item. (This could be done by placing uberguards around the gate of all classes to prevent their kiting away.) All people would be KOS to them until the quest is completed. I would perfer this faction solution in comparison to a "key" solution, since there's already been much complaints of too many soulbound keys. ;-)&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>Anyway, just some food for thought.<P>-Brad<P>-------<P>Would you guys stop with the 'downtime is there to keep people playing to make VI more $'... sheesh <P>The way we keep people playing is by making a fun and challenging game that people feel compelled to play... by focusing on character development, an immersive and interesting world, and by creating an environment where people can easily develop online relationships.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;I agree, too many people sidetrack this. But, how can you NOT find faults in a system that you spend hours upon hours on, and not blame anything or anyone for your hardships? The world is not full of perfect people.&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>Downtime is there as a penalty (please read my other posts). It's not supposed to be fun, and the challenge is to avoid it. <P>&gt;&gt;&gt;Of course. I don't mind Combat downtime so much, as I can effect it rather easily with my skill as a player. It's Class selection downtime and travel downtime that really ticks me off. (My primary being a Paladin I should probabally say.) I really, really regret not being a Cleric/Warrior/Enchanter, because I *know* I already have the makings of a great player; enough skill that is. However, situations are fairly slim that I can outdo a Cleric, Warrior, or Enchanter in any problem. Not bad enough for me to quit EQ of course, and not bad enough for me to abanding my primary character and chuck grouping with my EQ-friends out of the window. I took a big risk with a Paladin, and I even knew it at the start of character creation.<P>I just wish that there was more choice in it. Now that I've got my paladin up to XX level, I can't really abandon him. I'm already far behind my friends due to the xp penelty for being a hybird, and if I created a new char I would never even stand a chance.<P>Damn...slipping into a class, or actually, type-envy rant again...dreadfully sorry, I'm sure you get this crap all the time. If you're even reading this, that is. (Which is probabally not likely, but hey, this isn't such a bad way to spend a night after dinner.)<P>All in all, my main point is that I think you should take in class desireability, travel, and player skill to a higher weight than they have currently. There's more to downtime than just sitting in between spawns; there's also the problem of waiting on lists and not getting into groups, running across Butcherblock the %#*(@)%ing 300th time because I died in Unrest as a melee or hybird class; or want to make a pilgrimmage to Kunark, or to ride the boat to the mainland. I still get a small grin and a rememberance of happiness and awe the first few times I've done it, but the idea has generated now, leaving me bitter. This Frodo is a bit cranky because of it. :-)&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>If people thought there was too much downtime and that the majority of their experience playing wasn't any fun, they'd leave. It wouldn't KEEP people playing and make us money, rather it would have the OPPOSITE effect.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;I wonder, have you ever thought of trying out on the test server a system under which there was very little downtime at all? /shrug , that's what it's there for, no? I'm inclined to side with you on this issue, but just because we both are fairly sure on this point doesn't necessarily mean we're both right. :-)&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>Some of you might find this hard to believe, but the EQ teams are a bunch of gamers who want to make a great game. We NEVER talk about money and profits and revenue at tuning meetings. We talk about what would make the game better, or what needs to be addressed to fix balance issues, etc.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;It's not so much that the players really hate your game, and downtime. :-P It's the fact that they need a scape goat; when you stick people together on a boat for about half a year (I wouldn't be all that surprised if some people have /played over 6 months of EQ.) they will get cabin fever, no matter how pretty the boat may be. :-) There's an anology for you. Unfortunetly, talking about it won't convince many otherwise. :-) Heck, how many people REALLY switch political parties regularly? Much easier to stay with your fellows and ideals and damn reality.<P>Dammit, getting off topic again, this time on my attitude towards politics. :-) If you haven't drifted off of my post now, you will soon if this keeps up. :-)&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>In addition, there are no corporate suits breathing down our necks, pushing profits and such. That didn't happen when we were part of 989, nor did it happen as Verant, and it's not happening at SOE.<P>Why? Well, most good game companies know to leave their creative people alone as long as they're making great and profitable games. And guess what? EQ continues to be a huge success.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;Damn straight. From my person experience, I can safely tell you that I have played NO GAME WHATSOEVER as EverQuest. Nothing comes even close. Baulder's Gate, Command and Conquer, Starcraft, Tomb Raiders...nothing as approched it. You've made a damn fine game, even if I have tons of stuff to complain about. /salute &lt;&lt;&lt;<P>As a final note, just to really illuminate how ludicrous the 'downtime = more bucks for VI' argument is, let's talk a bit about bandwidth. It's really, really expensive. Were we purely out to make the maximum dollars possible, we'd scheme and plan to make a game where you hardly logged on at all, but still paid us ten bucks a month. That's right: the most profit comes from a subscriber who plays only occasionally. The guys who play crazy hours every day cost us more due to bandwidth used.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;LOL, I tried saying the exact same thing once on these boards. Got flamed faster than a Firebat on a Zergling, LOL.&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>That's right, casual gamers, we make the most money off of you! *evil cackle* <P>&gt;&gt;&gt;The ironies of life. :-)&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>-Brad<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;-Jearom&lt;&lt;&lt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Greetings.<P>I have been reading this topic and my interest was immediately peaked so I thought reply with the hopes that some of my thoughts and suggestions could benefit both VI and the players.<P>Let me first start by quoting an excerpt from one of Brad's initial comments.<P>---------<P>The fundamental advancement mechanism in MMORPGs is Time Invested; therefore, Time Lost needs to be the fundamental death penalty if the principle of risk vs. reward is to be preserved.<P>The time lost can be in the form of experience loss, an experience debt (a cool idea, btw), items lost (providing it takes time to acquire items), corpse retrievals, etc. <P>As a corollary, being efficient in terms of time spent is the quickest way to advance (assuming advancing quickly is your goal, of course). Downtime, which is likewise often debated and criticized, is also a penalty based on the Time Invested/Time Lost principle. Minimizing or even eliminating downtime using intelligent tactics in a well-balanced group is an efficient time investment. Failing to do so incurs a Time Lost penalty, though probably not as severe as dying.<P>-Brad<P>------<P>Brad's logic here is very sound. There can be very little doubt, as least in today's MMORPGs, that the fundamental advancement mechanism is time invested. MMORPGs were never meant to be based on dexterity, or reflex, or an easy straight line to acheiving your goals. It follows the old axiom that "some things are worth fighting for."<P>Being effecient in terms of time spent is therefore the quickest way to advance, as Brad has already mentioned. The design intent behind EQ is that the most effecient use of a players time (in terms of advancement) is to use intelligent tatics in a well balanced group.<P>If you notice, however, most players in the EQ community find that soloing is the quickest way to advance. This is contrary to the design intent of EQ. Soloing is also the activity which incurs the greatest amount of downtime. A well balanced group has much less down time, but players find that advancement is considerably slower. This, I believe, is the heart of the "downtime" problem.<P>This can really only lead us to two possible conclusions (or perhaps a combination of the following conclusions).<P>1. EQ does not function as it was intented (in terms of how a player advances quickly).<P>2. Players in the EQ community are using group tactics which yield slow advancement.<P>I personally believe that both of these conclusions contribute to the downtime problem. I also believe that each of these conclusions feed off one another (ie: EQ not being designed as intented encourages ineffecient tactics, and ineffecient tactics encourge the players to request changes from VI which would bring EQ further away from its design intent.) However, I also believe that something can be done about both of these conclusions to help eliminate the downtime problem.<P>Lets first look at conclusion 2 - Players not using effecient tactics in a group. This is a very difficult topic to discuss, since group tactics vary so much, depending on who you talk to and the situation in question. However, the common theme that keeps the players from acheiving quick advancement in a group, I believe, is the hesitancy to take risks and to try new or different tactics. In general, players in the EQ community will find a tactic that works and then stick with it, and partially close their minds to other possibilities. This follows the old axiom "if it ain't broke, don't fix it."<P>In this case, however, I think risk and change are something that we as players should be experiencing almost everytime we play EQ. So, what I suggest to any player reading this... don't be afraid.. try something new... think of something new.. suggest something that has more risk, but if done right, will increase your groups effeciency.<P>Here is a little tid-bit of information that may encourage all of you. It is possible, at L58, for a group to advance at a rate of one YELLOW (not blue) bubble per hour. No, I am not joking. I am completely serious. For any of you who wish to find out more about this, check out the news entry for Jan.2/2000 at www.graffe.com. To achieve such effecient advancement does involve taking more risks than we are accustomed to. However, these risks are virtually elimated by using the right tactics and group complement.<P>Second, lets look at conclusion number 1 - EQ does not function as it was intented (in terms of how a player advances quickly).<P>Advancing quickly in a group requires two very important things to happens.<P>1. You must be part of a relatively balanced group with people you can trust.<P>2. Your group must use tactics which yield fast advancement.<P>One of the problems with finding a good group is that the people you come to know and trust will not always be there. Players come and go... other things come up... people move... get a new job... get busy at work... etc. A lot of the time your long lost buddies come back but it often happens that your level difference is now too great to be able to realistically group together.<P>Another reality of EQ is that the higher in level your character gets, the more dangerous your encounters will be. This has the affect of wanting to group with players your know and trust, making it more difficult for groups to embark on risky encounters or new tactics if you have to group with players you don't. However, as I mentioned earlier, players come and go and its inevitable that players that you know and trust will no longer be able to group with you, forcing you to try and find others whom you can get to know well and trust. This becomes increasingly difficult as you level.<P>Its a circular problem. The higher in level your character gets, the greater the importance to have a good group which you can trust, but it also becomes more difficult to build that network of friends to build that group.<P>So what can VI do to help a player build that network of friends to build that good group? VI has already done a number of things to aid the players in this: guilds, emotes, various text communications modes. However, I believe something could be done by VI to help pool players together, of similar level, similar playing times and similar playing styles.<P>What I suggest is a player database on each of the servers. The database would only be accessable from the character selection screen. Each character a player has would have a profile which the player can edit. The profile would contain things that the server already knows (like level, class, race). Anything else the player could enter him or herself. Things like playing times, tactics you wish to try, style of play, classes needed for your group. There could then be a find button which would query the database to find players that match your profile (not exactly of course, but within reason). You could leave a message to another player to request that you meet at a certain time and place in game to actually play together and try out your mutual ideas.<P>So that is what I think. Of course I am just giving a very brief and rough outline of what the desired feature should do. It has to be thought through more thoroughly before anything could be done. But that is what I would like the VI team to do... think about a new feature such as this. Perhaps do a poll of all the players to see that they think. Or various polls to determine how this feature should really function.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

NOTHING should involve sitting for more than a minute or two.  the answer here: speed up ticks.  we currently have 6 second ticks.  make them into 2-3 second ticks.<P>voila, everythings faster, downtime advantages are mainatined.<P>please respond... this is my bare-bones analysis of the answer to your question.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The bottom line is this. Read all the post (in both parts) VI *STILL* misses he point. Simple: Customers are not happy with the down time. How hard is that to grasp? If what you say is true and all that goes on in tuning meetings is how to make a better game AND you garner your direction from feedback, then for crying out loud give it a rest. Do what your customers are asking for once. If we dont want to spend 40 minutes walking from Kael to MM, then fix it. Time lost as a penalty is one thing, but add EXP loss to it, and this is where you are at. EVen with both in *AS* a penelty, why am I penelized trying to get from Kunark's singe bloody point of teleport to SoV's single point of teleport. I dint die, I did nothing wrong, yet Im still penalized. As for the 'big game feel', last time I looked, the game had grown substantially and mode of travel is still too slow. Period, no need for discussion, read whats already been posted. I mean how hard is it. At a minimum, stop one or the other (EXP loss OR time loss). Check this out..Add a second screen after you choose your character when you log in to your server. On that screen, you could PICK the zone you want to start in. Crazy? Well, since you already admit casual players are footing your bill, give the customer the option. If I want the full immersed EXP of the scenery, the run, etc, then I can simply login as usual. If I only have 2 hours or less to play, and spending 1 hour in travel is too much, then I can pick a starting point everytime I log in. There ya go..Those that want the whole enchalada (Whatever) get it..those who just want to play a fun game they pay $10 a month for *FINALLY* get it. Ive posted before, I am going to quit due to time issues as well. And whats funny is that once again Verant thumbs its nose at its paying customers in Brads post..."If people thought there was too much downtime and that the majority of their experience playing wasn't any fun, they'd leave. It wouldn't KEEP people playing and make us money, rather it would have the OPPOSITE effect. " - Duh, what the heck you think we are trying to tell you here. And let me say this, in general, you MUST check yourself in business ANYTIME you feel your doing 'so great' can turn away business as you have suggested here. VI maybe profitable now, but its not all that AND a bag-a-chips. You say one thing, and project yet someting totally different. Oh and as for that whole bandwisth thing..I hope to high Heaven you were sleep drunk when you wrote THAT doozie. We aren't all 12 and 13 year olds playing this game ya know. Hmm, maybe thats the whole problem..nother thread there I suppose..Tell you what, since we are just making up scenarios here, you post how many t3's/ds3's or what not you got running into your complex and we will pit that against the ? mil a month figure your grossing. Suddenly I dont feel sympathetic at all..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Aradune:<BR>It's not a matter of "downtime", as per standard definition.  It's a matter of wasted time.  The only real challenge to this game is the time it takes to do stuff, not the actual accomplishment of the task.  Therefore the challenge is in time, not content<P>Solution is to decrease the time and increase the content.<P>I read these posts off of news sites, I don't really poll this board, I just comment now and then on things I feel strongly about, which is what I understand the actual purpose of this board.  Therefore, I'd like to propose a challenge to Verant and rather than take the 10% of the player bases's word, (assuming that is what posts here) hold an online poll regarding people's feeling on the waste of their RL time.<P>I think you might be surprised at the results.  I hate the downtime.  I spend more time doing dishes and housework, playing with my kid or watching TV **while medding** than I do actively playing the game.  Just something wrong with that.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Kudos, Aradune, Kudos!  Ok, I just thought I'd pop in a bit of wisdom about soloing...  I think that soloing should be a viable possibility at level 60.  I, sadly, do not play this game anymore, but I try to remain active through these boards.  The problem with making content for soloers is that, if the content is perfect for soloers, a "solid" 4-6 person group (tank, medic, rogue, 'chanter, wizard) would come in and run amok.  This is simply because, no matter how you look at it, a player in a group will be more effective than that player alone.  Imagine, if you will, a "solo tank" zone, designed for the tank by himself.  Now imagine how easily exploitable that would be by a tank with a cleric backing him up.  You need to find some way around it.  Once again, thank you Aradune and Absor and Abashi and Akriss and all you other guys whos names start with A :P  Please continue to read this far down the threads, and keep reading the thread as long as we keep posting.  I think that just getting the beginning of a thread is dangerous to us all, in more ways that one  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>-TWG</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Brad,<P>One of the posters mentioned that you should encourage taking risks and that right now you were doing just the opposite by making people afraid of taking risks because of the downtime involved in failing.<P>Your reply was that "risk" in itself implied a reward/penalty and that the penalty for faling to meet a challenge (read: risk) was downtime.<P>This is where you miss the boat.<P>The penalty for failing is not (or should not be) downtime, the penalty for failing is the failing itself! <P>This includes difficult corpserecoveries, melee having to run back several zones, not getting any of the treasures you were after (no debate there). But most of all it includes the way it can make you feel misserable because you didn't achieve what you came to do. <P>That is what the real penalty in games like this is. There is no need for added punishment like experience loss or needing 15 minutes to med back to full.<P>The challenge and therefor the punishment of the game lies in accomplishing or failing to reach goals (slaying dragons, breaking in a hard room, completing a quest, etc, etc, etc).<BR>The failing to accomplish a goal is what makes guilds/groups/players go back the next night and try again, and again and again until they win after which they move on to conquer the next challenge.<P>All you have to do (and have done sofar) is provide more and harder challenges.<P>Stepper<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Off peak players arguably suffer the most from downtime. Try getting a group/teleport/res/bind/etc when there are only 400-700 players on a server. In many places it can be all but impossible. I gave up playing non-binding characters because of this.<P>Also, while the extra content has been great for peak time crowding, it's had the opposite effect off peak, exacerbating the above problems.<P>Please ensure you take into account all of your paying customers, not just the peak crowd.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044924-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044924.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044924-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044924-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044924-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044924-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044924-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=044924&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=044924&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
