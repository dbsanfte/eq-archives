</FONT><HR>Maybe it's different since Rallos is an older server... but when Tallon Zek was no longer fun for me...<P>I quit playing on it.<P>I stayed on that server for several months--it wasn't that I was quitting after 5 levels of newbie fighting, I had 31 levels under my belt.  Not that impressive, but not a trivial time investment either.  I don't really understand why one would play with looting rules that make you miserable, which have been the same looting ruleset since the server's inception (minus the change to looting weapons).  Yes, I didn't like leaving my character behind, and I dust him off sometimes, but I wasn't going to stay on that server and complain all day to anyone who would listen.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Incidentally, my chat handle has nothing to do with my personal outlook on life or Rallos Zek. It's a goof on a friend of mine's name that just never got changed back.<P>As to the rest of your tripe- nothing is wrong with trying to fix an imblanced or broken system. Nothing it wrong with trying to come up with scenarios in which all interests are served. Apparently that is something that you can not grasp. If you think that is whining- whatever, that's your perogative. I still don't understand why you won't support the ability for everyone to choose the ruleset they prefer. Nor have I ever heard a defense as to why the current loot set up is OK on Rallos from you other than "I like it" and "it discriminates against twinks" (which in reality means it makes less obvious twinks). So the only reason I can think of for this is that you want everyone to suffer like you had to. Tell me I'm wrong and defend your logic.<P>You continue to denegrate our efforts, and that is why we scorn you. =)<P>I agree about the pumice nerf though- totally uncalled for.<P>And for the record, I do have a life. Gained it back with the 2 months off that I took recently because of this trash. I'm back only because of my friends (I missed them- sue me) and the fact that there is still no alternative to this game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>...and then in 6 more months have the ones who moved start petitioning about how 'itemloot is unfair' and spamming the boards again?  I have absolutly no doubt that this would happen because no matter what, no one is happy and there will always be people who think the already established rules should be changed for them in particular.<P>Also I think that Verant is kind of worried that there will be an uproar among the other 20+ (I think) something servers about how THEY should be able to do it.  I mean, look at the situation and the uproar when that guide got fired for moving a guild in secret across to a less populated server.  Every single server jumped in and started shouting about how unfair it is and how THEY should be able to move too.<P>Rules are established for a reason, to prevent chaos.  When some few individuals think that these rules should be changed for them, then why should it not be applied to everyone?<P>See?  No flames.<BR>Damn I'm good.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Tom,<P>It's not that we aren't enjoying the game itself...but we spent over a year with NO ALTERNATIVE than naked gank PVP for any chance at roleplayed PVP in this game..then lo and behold, Verant creates that option on a PVP Teams server that did not even exist for almost a year after this game was released.  An option that a majority of the players from Rallos Zek had been looking for when they started playing EQ and now were denied having unless they decided to throw away all the time they had spent building their characters in the game.<P>Does it make any sense to you at all that we want to get what we have been asking Verant for since the begining..and keep the progress we made and PAID for in the last year and a half's time?<P>Kyoshou</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The GM probably shouldn't have stated it in such absolute terms, but no, there are no plans to implement a move at present.  That however does not equate to "There will be no move".  <P>The quotes posted by Nanuvis-RZ on the first page of this thread still apply.  And I do apologize, but this is not an issue that I'll be able to give periodic updates on, as we've been shifting priorities a bit here.  <P>The PvP servers are still primarily PvE, like all of the other servers. PvP is there as an addition to the environment.  As such, if we have to decide between changes that will improve things across all servers, or only on the PvP servers, we'll have to go with the one across all servers first.<P>My recommendation would be that if you absolutly cannot stand playing on Rallos any longer, you should create a character on one of the other servers and play there.  As long as the population on Rallos continues to be strong, we're not going to assign priority to drastically changing the server environment.  I'm not trying to be short or gruff, but we are going to need some type of sign that drastic changes are indeed wanted on that server beyond what's on these boards to provide us with a business reason to assign it some priority.<P>-Gordon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well, if it is precedent you are looking for look no further than the test server moves.<P>And since it is a PvP only move (choose your ruleset), the blue servers don't have much to complain about now do they?<P>You would have to put up big disclaimers and indicate the ruleset of the server at the login screen, and then you could say they REALLY knew the rules when they started and they warned you. Then you would have ground to stand on, because the rules have changed and those that started on Rallos in the beginning had no choice in the matter.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Okay Abashi that is fair enough..and FYI, I have created a character on Tallon Zek to test that environment and start play there.  However consider this:<P>You should be aware that a lot of folk attach importance to their characters in this game, and take pride in how they have developed them...and view their accomplishments as having been earned.  It is not an easy thing to throw away what you have built for over a year because of the environment that you can tolerate but want change to.  This is why Rallos is still 'adequate' in population...because a lot of folks have no other option if they want to continue to play the characters they have spent so much time on.<P>Would not offering a move between all three servers show you exactly what the population wants?<P>Kyoshou</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

You guys are last in line and SOL.<P>When Shadowbane comes out I think that Verant will finally have the necessary business incentives to make changes.

</FONT><HR>I thought they didn't permit us to criticize their product or even comment on another product (Shadowbane).<P>I too look forward for Shadowbane.  They are actively attempting to address the naked gank syndrome.  How?  well, for PvP to truly work people have to have accountability.  And doing anything to ruin that accountability makes it difficult for their primary characters to trade/bank, etc.  So PK's won't be welcomed in cities.  I wish they would do that for RZ.  Make kinslayers unwelcomed in their home towns.  Make PK's unwelcome in various cities.  However, the faction portion really needs to be addressed.  Faction stops increasing at a certain point from doing quests and killing NPCs ... which doesn't make any sense.<P>If someone PK's, they should have a "kill meter."  The more folks they kill, the more various NPCs (especially bankers) not like them.<P>Oh ... it was funny last night.  I watched the wife (enchanter) retaliate against a level 16 PK (was same level), who said attacking near guards was an exploit ... even though she had worked on factions at High Pass to become amiable, while he was still dubious.  Mind you, she didn't use a pet or anything.  He attacked out of aggro range of guards, while she stood next to guards and cast.  I guess the PK's haven't learned the roleplay aspect of the game yet ...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>It is so hard to continue to ignore Isladar when he makes such wrong-headed (and down-right stupid) arguments. I have to assume he wants people to get on his case.<P>Isladar:<P>1. If all the melees would leave upon a movelog as you stated - that would indicate to most people that the system is flawed. Though you made the statement, you don't seem able to connect the dots.<P>2. You said-  "My *opinion* is that itemloot is just fine". Yeah - you are wrong.  Your opinion has nothing to do with the basic fact that the system is flawed. Opinions that go against the facts are not actually opinions, that is just ignorance. And choosing to be ignorant usually undermines the validity of one's statements. Verant knows it is flawed, so your 'opinion', in this instance, is worthless.<P>3. There have been moves.  A good number of them.  So there is no 'rule' that we are going against.  Just an attempt to get Verant to give us the same opportunity for different reasons. Reasons that are quite justified.<P>4. A year ago, I could put an average of 6-8 hours a day into the game (sad, but true). Now I am lucky if I get 6-8 a week (more like 1-2). I cannot re-make that investment. <P>5. Lazy whiners?  I would respond, but there is no way I could get an appropriate response to fit in the new boards policy. Question for Isladar: How many fingers am I holding up?<P>6. There is more - but I am sure most of this is flying under the radar, so why go on. <P>I have yet to see you post anything that was worthwhile.  You refuse to read/understand what others have posted, you contradict yourself, you talk down to people that are obviously far more astute then you, you make an effort to say things to make others angry.  Your posts and the statements made within them are pointless crap and I would be hard pressed to think that ANYONE is better off for having read them. Except perhaps you.<P>RZ players got the shaft, but Verant feels that we are a small enough playerbase to justify screwing us over. I wonder if they have the morals to even feel bad about what they are doing? Or if the money has cured them of such things.

Better games are not that far away - and Verant doesn't know what they are doing. They screw up EVERY patch, the improvements are minor and a year too late, they still think making the game super hard is the way to 'trap' people into paying longer.  Bah.

</FONT><HR>See like i said, play, move, or quit.<P>Yes it sucks and not very fair but life isnt very fair.  If it effects you that much move or quit.  This game is meant to be fun and if your dwelling over the fact that item gankers can take the loot youve camped for over a week in 3 seconds then your on the wrong server.  Sure naked item gankers have every advantage in the world, and it is super easy to make decent money on ebay on rallos but hey, if you dont like it you can move or quit.  <P>If you want to make some extra cash why not create or buy a high level mage and camp tp/zonelines then sell your winnings on ebay.  Your rep will go down the tubes but your pocket books will get thicker.  There is no risk to you at all on Rallos!  Hell, you can now legally corpse camp just as long as you give the person 30 seconds to loot and go as stated by GM Akkirus.  <P>If you got rid of item loot, all the players on the blue servers would have no place to go to terrorize newbies when they got bored of their servers.  I like seeing the chaos in the newbie zones.  I like it when someone is trying to get to lev 4 but has to sit by the guards all day long because the pkers are out and about.<P>If you lose an item to a pker.... well camp the spot where you  got the item or try and buy it back.  The pk will never give it back no matter how much you whine and beg.  Just deal with it.  <P>Its rallos, the crap hole of Everquest!   Come on, quit yer crying and deal with it.  Whinning here has never done anything!  Like ABashi says, move if you dont like it!  If you can move then quit!  If you cant quit then your just whining. Stop the whinning, Rallos isnt going to change! <P>Verant has resisted your whines<BR>Verant has hit YOU with Abashi's words for 999999 damage!!<BR>LOADING...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I'm not starting over after putting a year into a character, and it's a damned insult for you to suggest that as an option.  So basically you win.  It truly is your world.  Congratulations.  Just know that I will NEVER buy another Verant product.  The lousy thing is that the majority of EQ players never got to experience EQ from a Rallos Zek player's perspective and probably will buy your products in the future.<P>It's a real shame that a company like Looking Glass goes out of business, while a detestable company like Verant prospers.  <P>*shrugs*<P>Here's hoping you get yours in the end Verant.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>In other words, you have to be more than just unhappy to get Eq's attention.  You have to be so disapointed, that you quit or move to another server..then, maybe, just maybe, they'll think about making some simple changes to improve everyone enjoyment....maybe that is.<P>Gamers are a dedicated group.  We'll hang out, hoping against hope, being faithful to the end that the designers care enough to listen to our needs.  Unfortunately, the only thing EQ understands is "numbers and dollars".

</FONT><HR>Apparently, Abashi wants the numbers.  We should give him numbers.  I suggested this before, I will suggest it again.  A server-wide boycott.  I think it is not unreasonable to ask people who are unhappy with the system to dedicate a week or two to telling Verant how things are.  <BR>I am not experienced at organizing large-scale events, but if the drive for this boycott is started, and dates are set, I am think I can ensure my guild's, and several other guilds participation.  Any suggestion on how we can start about organizing this?<P>The basic idea is simple: If you are unhappy with the way RZ is, stay off it for a predetermined week (or two).  Go goof off on other server, try out a different game, go to a bar, run for president - whatever.<BR>If majority of guilds participate, various unguilded individuals logging are much less likely to find groups.  I'd suggest putting up 'town cryers' that would move between zones and /shout about the boycott.<BR>A lot of PKs are likely to lose interest in RZ for the duration of boycott.  No pool of available victims = no fun, so they might just go elsewhere as well, 'till them lamerz are done with their stoopid boycott', thus furthering our cause.<P>To Isladar: you contradict yourself.  You say the system as it is is just fine and great.  At the same time you say if move was offered, majority of melees would immediately jump ship, terribly upsetting PvE.  Why would they do that if the system is fine and great?<P>Oh, and it is not our opinion that this server sucks.  I love this server.  I spent a whole year on this server.  I am in a great guild and I have a lot of friends here.  My guild is already doing its own Plane runs (doing Hate this weekend) IMHO, it could be the best server in EQ if there was a way to make parasites, who currently go unpunished, suffer for their actions.  <P>An interesting idea:  Was mentioned by D.Allen, CEO of Artifact, maker of Horizons. (http://www.artifact-entertainment.com/horizons/), in an interview.<BR>There will be a notoriety system, somewhat similar to both EQ factions and UO fame/karma.  However, in UO/EQ, you KNOW where NPCs you should avoid are - and thus you can avoid them or send in a mule if needed.  In Horizons, if you displease some faction too much, they may start sending assassins after you.  Say, you PKed way too many humans from Qeynos.  Now no matter where you are - Lavastorm, Sebilis, Plane of Hate - you might at any moment see Corporal Lancot charging at you,  intent on doing a LOT of points of damage to your scrawny PK butt.  Exp loss included, of course.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Abashi,<P>All i can say is that why did you even propose the move/log in the first place, when in essence, Verant itself was not sure whether or not they were going to implement it.  You basicly proposed an idea that would make everyone happy.  Give the people that wanted to stay, to stay.  And the people that wanted to move, to be able to move.  Those for and against item loot accepted the idea.  Now, plainly, you have said there will be no move.  My complaint is that if Verant was not sure on how they were going to proceed, then you should have said anything in the first place. Proposing an idea that makes everyone happy and then telling those same people that you have changed your mind seems kind of cruel. Im sorry, but starting over will not be an option for me.  I have spent alot of real life time in to my character.  Time and more importatntly money i could have spent elsewhere. I am not doing it again.  And i know many feel the same way I do.  Basiclly, that leads only one other option, and that is to quit which at yet im not going to do but that day is coming closer and closer.  I realy hope you rethink your stance on the move log and give not only the rallos players, but all pvp players that feel they are trapped in looting systems that they do not agree with the opportunity to play were they can be happiest.<P><BR>Vilmar Bloodlore<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Abashi,<BR>Start over? After a year of my time invested in my character on Zek? I don't think so.<P>You seem to overlook that fact - people have friends on Zek, they have a lot of time and effort put into their characters and are not willing to start over.<P>This is a complete cop-out. Fair enough, you don't care enough about the PvP game to be bothered fixing it. Fair enough, you want to cater to the minority of people (mostly gankers who steal items for no other reason than greed and to ruin the gameplay of others) who enjoy item loot. <P>Here are your options, all of which are easy, all of which take a minimum of your time:<P>Run a server-specific poll on Rallos asking people what they think about item loot. Also ask them if they would be willing to move if a server-wide loot rules change is not an option.<P>Open a movelog and allow people to move between the PvP servers.<P>What's wrong with doing either one of these?<P>LISTEN TO YOUR CUSTOMERS! We are NOT happy with the situation on Rallos. True, we started there voluntarily - a year ago, before many of us realized how painful it can be to lose that SMR to a ganker while you're vulnerable. When I started there were fewer gankers and more roleplaying PvP. It doesn't exist any more.<P>ALLOW US TO CHOOSE OUR LOOTING SYSTEM. If that has to be a character move to a blue server or one of the other Zeks, so be it. <P>Are you not allowing a move because you're afraid that RZ will be a ghost town with nobody playing on it? If that's the case, then why not make the server coin-only? If there aren't enough item looters to sustain the server by themselves, then they don't have enough of a voice to override the majority who want out of item loot hell.<P>DON'T INSULT YOUR PLAYERBASE BY SUGGESTING WE START OVER. I will NOT dump the 39 days played time my main character on Zek has. I will NOT dump the relationships I have forged there. I will NOT accept that answer.<P>Sorry for all the caps, but I'm just a tad irritated at your COMPLETE disregard for your playerbase. Fine - you say that no-one can be sure who the majority is. RUN A SERVER POLL! That will tell you once and for all what the majority opinion is. The only reason for not doing this is laziness and a PROFOUND disregard for your customerbase.<P>Mantik Boneweaver<BR>47th Necro of RZ</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I can tell you why there will be no move and why there will be no vote. Verant knows what we want, they know the consequence of offering a move, they know more then anything that they have us against a wall.  It's like offering to make a secluded island to put murders on and letting them kill each other. Yes that makes sense, but it's not going to happen.  If they offered a move the response would be SO overwhelming it would take up more of their time and they would have to devote less time depositing the money WE give them, and less time devoted to the "real servers" who they seem to love.<BR>It's easy for all those who haven't spent a year making and leveling a player to say "if you don't like it move" It's more then just the fact that we've devoted alot of our time to these chars!! It's that we've made good friends, and guilds, and learned to love the people we meet there. Sure, we can drag a few select friends to a different server, but I will never again see the majority of people that I've come to admire and love. How can you put a value on that Abashi?<BR>I'm amazed by the cold hearted attitude that verant has taken on something that so many people have asked to change!! It's amazing that we have no say.

I'm not talking about a 'sit-in' or other online presense, I'm talking about dropping thier numbers for that server for a week.  Make another char somewhere, play another game, or go out and get some sun.  The point is your are not on thier server any more. <P>Hopefully, if everyone complies (which I know will be tough), someone will have to notice..<P>"Gee Brad, last week we had an average of 400 people per day instead of 2000, think there is an issue we should address there??"<P>I'm not saying this would be easy to do, after all many are addicted to EQ and won't want to give up a day offline, much less a week.

And you don't HAVE to be still a Verant customer to participate. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ok this stupidity has got to stop.  I had hoped that Abashis comments would have silenced the majority of you, but it seems that his comments only add fuel to an already dying fire.  If I was Abashi, I would ignore the select few who come onto these boards and cry about how evil ol Verant is FORCING them to sink 10 dollars a month into a game they hate.<P>I will address the few of you worthy of my attention:<P>Tera,<BR>You honestly are not worthy of my attention but your blatantly childish comments turned my head, seeing as how it was directed at me.<P>&gt;&gt;Your opinion has nothing to do with the basic fact that the system is flawed&lt;&lt;<P>How is it flawed?  In your opinion it is flawed.  In my opinion it works just fine.  What facts are there that support your statement?  That there are a few people who pk with no armoris that a flaw?  I think that it is more of a game challenge that you overcome and you learn to play smart.  <P>For example, DONT FREAKING SOLO!  How many of you actually solo?  So that image about naked gankers attacking you while you solo a mob one on one is either not true or makes you an idiot.  Not you Tera, I am speaking in general.  2nd Dont travel fully armored.why the hell would you TP with a cobalt BP on??  Think about it thats freaking stupid.<P>&gt;&gt;A year ago, I could put an average of 6-8 hours a day into the game (sad, but true). Now I am lucky if I get 6-8 a week (more like 1-2). &lt;&lt;<P>Ok well a year ago you had problems.  Now you arent online enough to do any type of signifigant gaming.  Like Planes runs.  1-2 hours a week?  Please you are a casual gamer and the current looting system couldnt possibly affect you unless you are soloing<P>&gt;&gt;How many fingers am I holding up?&lt;&lt;<P>Well these types of comments certainly demonstrate your maturity and intelligence.  Are you some kind of doctor or lawyer?<P>&gt;&gt;I have yet to see you post anything that was worthwhile. You refuse to read/understand what others have posted, you contradict yourself, you talk down to people that are obviously far more astute then you, you make an effort to say things to make others angry. Your posts and the statements made within them are pointless crap and I would be hard pressed to think that ANYONE is better off for having read them. &lt;&lt;<P>Well I apologize.  I will try to live up to YOUR standards of posting.  How about this:  STFU and get the hell off our server  or  How many fingers am I holding up?  Sigh<P>&gt;&gt;-tera 'the *****y fool'&lt;&lt;<P>Indeed<P>Wayward,<BR>You seem to be the only one who can post intelligently without getting all emotional about a damn game.  I think you have a few valid points, but they are, after all just your opinion.  And 1500+ people per night cant all harbor the same opinions as the ones here on this board.<P>Breagalidad or whatever your name is<BR>You say:<BR>&gt;&gt;To Isladar: you contradict yourself. You say the system as it is is just fine and great. At the same time you say if move was offered, majority of melees would immediately jump ship, terribly upsetting PvE. Why would they do that if the system is fine and great?&lt;&lt;<P>I said that in my *opinion* it is fine and great.  Is this so difficult to understand?  I think that in all practicality, that if a move was offered a big portion of melees who dont have no-drop gear would take it.  Their *opinion* is that it is better to be on a server with no challenge  I am stating 2 different opinions, not facts.  I am not even sure if I am right on the idea that melees would take off at the slightest opportunity, thats just what I get from hearing the  incessant whining on these boards.<P>Mantik<BR>Kinda emotional are we?  Chill dude its just a game.  I think it is funny that Abashi basically repeated his statements from a few months ago and now everyones is like well why didnt you tell us earlier!!.  I will guarantee that 2 months from now the same type of **** will happen and Abashi will issue the same statements and then everyone will say how Abashi keeps stringing them along and how they wish he would have said something along those lines 2 months ago.<P>Ktrina Stormsurge,<BR>Yes Im sure that the staff at Verant sit around with their fat wallets and ask themselves, how can we hurt our customers the most?  How can we intentionally f*ck up their lives, since we hold a gun to their head and FORCE them to play.<P>Sigh<BR>I think this thread will get shut down because it has degenerated into a bunch of flames and emotional cries for help.<P>And oh yes I'm sure this stratics board will be very very fair.  No multiple posting at all.<P>/em rolls his eyes.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>If it is super easy to get items in PvP no one should be allowed to move from the server along with items/money to another server where these same items cannot be earned in similar fashion. You maybe allowed your NO DROPS but that's about it. Even that wouldn't be fair since I could for example use an item(s) from PvP to hire people to help me accuire a NO DROP item. Rallos is a completely different environment due to item loot and the only common thing between it and others is levels. If you are leaving Rallos, levels should be the only thing you are allowed to take with you. If all melees leave I am immedeattely starting an ogre warrior or a monk(ey) just in anticipation of the warm care people will give me. I think I could joing a mid size guild and get them to plevel me as high as humanly possible just so they can do plane runs again. I still don't get why melees are whining so much even though even an injured warrior is much less vulnerable then lets say a caster who just zoned with no mana or pet. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Normally, this would all be fine if there was any chance that we could recover our item back.

With all fo your down time the most you have accomplished is keeping me from playing the game during down time. Not one change you have made since kunark has made my game experience any different.

</FONT><HR>I thought that was basically the entire attraction of RZ, Mindswayer.  I thought that this is the hell server and that you have to level against extremely difficult odds and against people with no conscience or remorse.  THAT is the attraction to me, and that makes it, in my opinion, the perfect server, with the perfect challenges.  If you can't hack it I suggest you play on a blue server.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I find Abashi's response ironic.<P>Essentially he said:<P>"If you don't like it, start over somewhere else.  Because we WON'T move anyone off the server until the population gets low enough to indicate there's a problem."<P>So essentially we're being blackmailed (at least that's how it feels to me).<P>We must give up our investment of time and effort in our characters on Rallos, such that the population falls below some "threshold" point that Verant has supposedly determined indicates that there is a "problem" with that server.<P>This is, of course, in spite of the fact that even Verant acknowledges that there are problems with PvP, and PvP risk vs reward on Rallos.<P>What's even more interesting is the "apparent" lack of Verant participation on the Rallos Zek server.<P>To my knowledge (and I'm betting everyone else's on the planet as well) NO ONE from Verant has ever played a significant amount on Rallos Zek.<P>Even for testing and "balancing" issues, EVERYTHING starts out balanced for the BLUE servers.  Then we get half-baked attempts at 'fixing' problems that occur on the PvP servers that usually end up causing more problems or worse yet, become SERIOUS debilating nerfs (ie:  pumice, enchanter illusions, invis, charm, etc.).<P>Anyway I just can't see how Verant can sit there and say "Ok it's broke, but if you don't like how it's broke, you have leave.  Oh yeah, and if you leave you can't take your characters with you.  So if you don't leave you keep the server population up which means it's not really broke so we won't have to anything."<P>I can't beleive how two faced and underhanded this is, and I CAN'T believe that Abashi doesn't see it either.<P>To me, this shows a serious lack of empathy on Verant's part...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009267-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009267.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009267-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009267-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009267-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=009267&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=009267&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
