</FONT><HR>ITEM: Healing<P>as stated before, a 39th level cleric should *NOT*, under *ANY* circumstance be a better healer than a level 60 shaman (or druid), let alone two or more shamans (or druids).<P>my guild has called off four raids in recent history (last couple weeks) because we didn't have enough clerics.  this is despite the fact that there was at least 3-4 druids and 3-4 shamans online, but only 2-3 clerics.<P>the taunt factor of complete heal is also *far* too low.  i can do /assist healing with superior heal on people and get pummeled on the next aggro check for the mob.  but a cleric can complete heal several times on several targets and never get attacked.  i've seen this on trakanon, zlandicar, several named mobs in plane of growth.  often times all the druids and shamans are dead at the end of the fight but the clerics all lived.  in reality, complete heal should be one of the highest taunts in the game.  <P>ITEM: DoTs and corpse poofing<P>because of this bug, my guild has *FORBIDDEN* the use of *ALL* DoT spells and effects on raids.  it doesn't matter if this is "better" or "fixed", we will get immediately booted from a raid if we use DoTs.  if it weren't for this, shamans could add thousands of damage with pox, bane, plague and envenomed bolt.  necromancers could add thousands as well with their DoTs.<P>ITEM: Group buffs<P>let's look at some numbers here:<P>group buffs -<BR>talisman of the rhino: +42 str<BR>talisman of the raptor: +50 dex<BR>talisman of the cat: +45 agi<BR>talisman of the brute: +40 sta<BR>talisman of the serpent: +40 cha<P>51+ bufs -<BR>maniacal strength: +67 str (same as 49th level buff too)<BR>mortal deftness: +60 dex<BR>deliriously nimble: +52 agi<BR>riotous health: +50 sta<BR>unfailing reverence: +55 cha<P>34/39/jaundiced bone armor buffs -<BR>furious strength: +34 str<BR>deftness: +40 dex<BR>nimble: +36 agi<BR>health: +31 sta<BR>glamour: +32 cha<P>lets look at these numbers carefully.  what do we see?  well, i see that there isn't much difference between the amount from the talismans (group buffs) and the 34-39 buffs.  in fact, the largest difference is between the dexterity buffs at a factor of 10.  also, the difference between the jaundiced bone armor buffs and the 51+ single target buffs just isn't enough to justify spending mana.  any shaman that can cast all of the group buffs should be fully equipped in jaundiced bone armor except the breastplate (not applicable here) and greaves (casts 34th level stamina buff, health).  many shamans will have the spirit weavers breastplate which casts riotous health.  <P>there is no compelling reason for any shaman to cast the mana using spells, either single target or group versions when they can right click their armor for no mana cost at all.  certainly using the group buffs saves time, but think about this for a moment.  stamina is the only stat buff we have that is beneficial to all classes.  everything else is limited in use.  strength benefits only melee/hybrids, agility benefits only those with &lt;75 AGI, dexterity only benefits those who process weapon effects or are learning weapon skills and charisma only benefits enchanters and bards (remember, enchanters have their *OWN* charisma buffs - yet shamans have no way to buff wis other than bear form).<P>compound to the fact that other than stamina (and to a lesser extent agility) all the stats shamans can buff are meaningless, stat buffs just aren't a worthwhile way for us to spend our mana and time.  perhaps if buffing STR had the same effect of directly buffing ATK... perhaps if buffing AGI improved the chance to block/parry/riposte/dodge... perhaps if dexterity improved chance to hit... perhaps if enchanters didn't have their own charisma buff... perhaps *THEN* stat buffs would be useful and wanted.  but as it stands now, stat buffs are merely a "junk" buff used in front of real buffs when encountering mobs that dispell (nagafen, for example), or for a placebo effect so those tanks think they're more effective.<P>ITEM: Fizzles on higher level spells<P>when i got cannibalize (the level 24 spell), it didn't fizzle every other cast like cannibalize 3.  when i got greater healing i could cast it for hours and never see a fizzle, unlike fizzling all the time like superior heal.  when i got invisibility, i didn't fizzle it TWENTY SEVEN TIMES in a row like i have with acumen - and my divination skill at that time was around 20. <P>cannibalizeIII and superior heal are alteration spells.  i specialized in alteration.  my specialize alteration is *MAXED*.  my alteration skill is *MAXED*.  i'm a grand poobah master extraordinaire alteration caster.  i'm a level 58 shaman (almost 59 even).<P>why do i fizzle cannibalize 5 times in a row?  and usually at least one out of every two or three casts?<P>why do i fizzle superior heal three times in a row almost every time i cast it?<P>divination is my second highest spell skill.  i have 222 divination.  i fizzle acumen a *lot*.  almost 3-4 times every time i cast it.  conjuration is my second lowest spell skill.  i have 190 in conjuration.  i almost never fizzle bane of nife.  acumen and bane of nife are the same level.  why the vast difference in fizzle amounts?<P>ITEMS: Alchemy<P>more than just the items that absor mentioned (sell back, stacking, reagent requirements - which i think should be looked at), alchemy just plain *sucks*.<P>i spent 2 hours one afternoon a few months back working on my alchemy skill.  i spent well over 5000 platinum pieces.  i made the most useful potions i could think of, ones that would be useful to people so i could make some money back.  i created a slough of invisibility to undead (11p), enduring breath (13p), levitate (10p), shrink (10p), stamina buff (10p) and several other semi useful potions.<P>except for the shrink potions, i wound up selling each and every one back to the vendor except a few i kept for my own use (invis undead).  the only potions i get requests are for shrink and spirit of wolf and very rarely invis to undead.  i have 156 skill, but never really use it for anything other than poison resist potions, gate potions and shrink / sow potions.  there's DOZENS of potions that can be made.  but most shamans are only making about 4-6 types.<P>ITEM: Rage Line in General<P>i memorized rage before the changes and i used it sometimes.  i only memorize it now when i want to see how high my buffed AC can get.  it sits on page 49 in my spell book.  i have voice of the berserker.  i dont know if i'll ever cast that one either.<P>taking away the HP regeneration from this spell was the worst thing that could happen to it.  in fact, i'd like to see the original regeneration added back.  i dont care if that means taking away *ALL OTHER* effects of this spell.  the regeneration is what made it useful.<P>ITEM: Pets<P>i don't use my pet.  i haven't used my pet regularly since i was soloing spirocs in timorous deep at levels 44-49.  i sometimes cast it to clear out green dungeons when i'm farming (droga, kaesora), but i have never once cast my pet in an exp group post 55.  the mana cost for the 55 pet is far too much for what it gives me and the level is far too low for the pet to be useful against most of the mobs i am fighting (level 51+ mobs).<P>the pet sucks.  i don't care if anything is done to it.  i know verant will never fix the mana cost to something reasonable.  i know verant will never boost the pet enough to be at least *somewhat* useful in *some* situations (like easy exp groups).<P>ITEM: Torpor<P>this spell needs to stack with regens (i heard that it does, good) as well as cleric celestial elixir / health spells.  this also needs to be castable on someone under the effects of a damage over time effect (like boiling blood, trakanon poison, zlandicar's rotting flesh, etc).  <P>it makes sense to have the attack and movement slow on this spell.  but those negative effects warrant making it a group only spell.  as a group only spell it is very very limited in usefulness on a raid.  most times when i'm on a raid all i am doing is F8 /assist heal.  rinse, repeat.  i almost always have a cleric in my group to do the healing for group members.<P>ITEM: Tigir's Insects<P>very cool idea.  however the effect radius is about the smallest of any AE spell i've seen.  even the shaman rain spells have a larger area of effect.  i'd just like to see the AE range increased to that of the rain spells at least.<P>Tigir's insects, pox of bertoxxulous and bane of nife drop rates are very very low.  on tribunal server, there's four guilds that regularly do trakanon.  not all the high level shamans in these guilds have all three of these spells.  in fact, there's probably only about 5 copies of each spell on the server.  compare this to roughly a dozen shamans 56+ needing these spells to complete their spell book.<P>ITEM: Stacking of Curse of Spirits<P>the only use for this effect, really, is soloing.  the spell duration is 1:20-1:40 (i forgot which :P).  most mobs in experience camps don't live longer than 30 seconds.  and the DoT corpse poof bug has already been addressed in this post above - making it useless for raids.  <P>clerics and enchanters get effects on their epic weapons that *GREATLY* and *HUGELY* benefit their guild in every way.  from exp groups to large scale raids, there is no situation that these items aren't useful (except when people don't die, or in all caster groups, heh).  the effect on the spear of fate is hardly useful to the entire guild.  an effect that gave say 400 hp and 15 hp / tick regeneration would be a much more beneficial effect than something that will almost never be used on a raid.<P>ITEM: New Healing spell at 60th<P>fix torpor as i described above and this item isn't necessary.  torpor is an extremely good, efficient heal.  however it has problems that need to be addressed for it to be useful in *all* situations.<P>ITEM: Cannibalize II quest<P>cannibalize 2 sucks.  i tested my mana regeneration using this vs. cannibalize when i got the spell (around level 52).  i went completely out of mana (with rage before it was changed) and then cannibalized back up to full.  it took longer (by a couple minutes) with cannibalize 2 than cannibalize.<P>the quest is much too difficult for the level of spell it is.  city of mist and kaesora are reasonable places for quest items to drop, but karnor's castle isn't.  most shamans i know just stick it out until 54 when they get cannifizzle 3.<P>ITEM: Avatar<P>let me put it bluntly:  THIS SPELL [expletives] SUCKS!!!<P>6 minute duration, 3 minute recast, 325 mana, 22 platinum cost component.<P>and once again, stat buffs *SUCK*.  the tanks that a level 60 shaman will be buffing are going to have at least 200 strength, probably 130+ agi and 120+ dex.  the *ONLY* benefit of this spell is the 100 ATK it gives.  if i were to redesign this spell into something that i would actually *cast* once in a while (like more than never), it would look something like:<P>Mana cost: 325 (this is fine)<BR>Casting Time: 3 seconds (this is fine)<BR>Component: None*<BR>Duration: 30 minutes (making it useful on large raids, at least somewhat)<BR>Recast: 30 seconds<BR>Effects:  +100 ATK +100 STA +100 STR +30 AC<P>* - maybe make it require a peridot.<P>ITEM: Jaundiced Armor<P>iksar shouldn't be able to wear this.  if iksar are allowed to wear jaundiced bone then barbarians, trolls and ogres should be allowed to wear kylong and sebilite scale.<P>since those armors are restricted by size, let's just say that jaundiced bone armor is *large* sized  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>ITEM: Malo line of spells<P>until we get "Malo", these spells are limited in use.  because the line is based on a save that it is trying to debuff (magic) there's going to be a lot of resists.  on 100% MR mobs this series will *NEVER* stick except for the spell Malo itself.  at least in the case of some 100% MR mobs they are not 100% resistant to all other saves.<P>Malise/Malisement/Malosi/Malosini should be on a resist table similar to Lifetap, Boiling Blood, Theft of Thought or the wizard Lure spells.  something that is nearly unresistable.  of course due to "Malo" these should be slightly more resistable than lifetap etc, but not so much that it takes seven (yes, seven) attempts to land one on say a myconid reaver. (and that was *with* the reaver tashed by the enchanter, too.)<BR>-------------------------------------<BR>Basically, Absor, high level shamans want to be useful on raids.  We don't want to feel redundant when there's already 2 shamans present (3 or more and the others start to feel useless).  The cleric monopoly on healing with Complete Heal is completely and utterly unbalanced.  No single class should be *SO GOOD* at something that no one else need apply.  My guild has done plane of growth raids with 2 clerics and no shamans or druids present at all.  But take away just one of the clerics and it just can't happen.  We have cancelled raids, as i mentioned before, because there wasn't enough clerics, despite that there was two to three times as many druids and shamans online (we have three 58+ shamans, all of whom are present for many of the raids we do).<P>Aside from healing, we'd like our buffs to be useful.  Stat buffs just plain *SUCK*.  They suck so much that when we were doing Zlandicar today the shamans were casting only riotous health and talisman of kragg (no level 60's for focus yet).  The other buffs would have wasted valuable buff slots.  When I have been asked for other stat buffs on raids, it has almost always been strength, and never because it gives that much more effect, it just makes the recipient "feel better", in their words.<P>Talamay Crystalspirit<BR>Level 58 Luminary<BR>Sol Invictus<BR>Tribunal Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Hmm….this is going to make me unpopular with some...<BR>I would like to propose that certain ‘sacred cows’ of class balance be reconsidered. There is a statement you hear over and over..."We don’t want to cut into the role of X as primary X (cleric = healer, warrior = tank, etc). I want to reconsider this issue.<P>1) It has been amply stated that at high levels, clerics and warriors (and in non-Velious zones, enchanters) are assured a place in every group and that the other slots are fought over by the remaining classes. The perception that is created is that The Vision™ only has a place for clerics and warriors at the high levels, and the other classes were just added as an afterthought to pacify those who found the ‘true classes’ too restrictive.<BR>2) A lot of time is being put into discussing minor adjustments to the other classes, so as to make them useful enough to be considered for groups,..BUT THEY ARE OPERATING FROM THE ASSUMPTION THAT THESE CHANGES SHOULD NOT ALLOW THEM TO DISPLACE ANY OF THE CORE (WARRIOR, CLERIC, ENCHANTER) MEMBERS. The operating assumption here is that warriors and clerics are guaranteed a place in a group, but that the other classes are optional and can be dispensed with.<P>I believe this approach is in error. If true class balance were to occur, a group would need to be made up of healers, tanks and casters. BUT Rangers and Paladins should be able to fill in for warriors, perhaps at lesser efficiency (with rangers maybe doing more damage, but tanking less well or paladins tanking as well, but doing less damage). Or the shamans and druids could fill in for the cleric, with INCREASED DOWNTIME, but NOT a complete inability of the group to operate. This reduced efficiency SHOULD be able to be compensated for by a good group (as is true at lower levels). <P>In other words...WHY ARE THE CLERICS AND WARRIORS ROLE IN A GROUP CONSIDERED TO BE SACRED AND UNREPLACABLE? <P><BR>The obvious (knee-jerk) response is...We don’t want to cut down on their usefulness to a group.<P>But this response only makes sense if there is something special about clerics and warriors that makes them MORE DESERVING of being in a group (aside from the skills they bring to the group). And I don’t see why that should be so. YOU CANNOT HAVE A SITUATION WHERE ALL CLASSES ARE EQUALLY DESIRABLE, AS LONG AS YOU HAVE CLASSES WITH A PROTECTED STATUS THAT CANNOT BE REDUCED. As long as every group must have one of each of a few classes, the remaining classes, BY DEFINITION, must be less desirable to the groups. To make ALL the classes balanced (and not just the less desirable ones) requires either increasing the abilities of the ‘secondary classes’ (EVEN IF THAT MEANS THEY MAY ECLIPSE THOSE OF THE SACRED CLASSES) or nerfing the core classes (which is neither my intent, nor is it feasible, as the mobs are balanced to groups containing these classes, at their current ability levels).<P><BR>Or, to put it another way..<P>Goal: Each class should be as close to equally valuable to a large raiding party. The decision of which class to take (as long as the essential roles of tank, healer and caster are filled) should have MORE to do with HOW WELL THE PLAYER PLAYS HIS CLASS, then with the specific class of healer, tank or caster.<P>Current Situation: Certain classes are essential (warrior, cleric, enchanter (some areas)), other classes are useful (Shaman, Bard, Rogue) and others have little to add (Necro). If you need a healer (at high levels), you are VASTLY better off with a cleric played by some barely adequate E-bayer, then you are with two shamans played by the best players to ever play a shaman. <P>Fix: Stop ‘protecting’ the status of the essential classes by making sure that the classes with secondary abilities are useless at the highest levels. Sure…Clerics should always be better healers, but shamans and druids SHOULD be able to do it in a pinch (and a slow heal spell that heals the equivalent of ONE hit by the mob is NOT adequate, and neither is one that significantly reduces the tanks effectiveness (torpor). Warriors will always be better healers, but Rangers and Paladins SHOULD be able to stand up to the highest level mobs, with the party changing tactics some to compensate (more healing needed or more caster damage needed). <P>{Ducking and Running for Cover as all the warriors and clerics who are afraid their ‘hard-earned’ guaranteed spots on raids might be threatened start to give chase}<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt;Yes, we've been over that. Iksar can wear ONE suit of planar armor wheras all other shamans get to choose from many. There is no rational reasoning for this.<P>Just because it's been said before doesn't make it any less valid. When I talk about this I am talking about end game. In the end game, you get your high ac/wis armor *and* you get your Innate AC Bonus. It's a completely valid point; the AC bonus was supposed to make up for lack of being able to wear the best armor, yet Iksar can wear the best armor. It's a double bonus. I agree you guys probably need more quest armors and armor in-between. I don't agree you need the bracer. It's one of the 2 balancing points of Iksar; Slam and Bracer.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> As you can see by these posts shamans by far want answers concerning the value of stat buffs.Stat buffs were nerfed very early in the game to prevent powerleveling.NERF stat buffs,make them only castable on players 7 levels below the caster.THEN make them do what they should.<P>Make stat buffs wanted by uther players.<BR>Make a 50% strength increase do 50% more damage.<BR>Make 50% agility decrease damage taken a reasonable amount.<BR>Make a 50% stamina increase noticeable to a player.<P> When even increases of 50% or more are barely or not at all noticeable to effect somethings wrong.<BR> Even if nothing is done to stat buffs beyond group spells ask the people who program this game what effect they really have.<BR> Dont ignore the #1 question shamans are asking.<BR>On debuffs,they really need to look at these spells.Other than major encounters theres really no value to these spells.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I agree...the lack of "plate" on Iksar is THE only balancing factor.  Think about what aspects are MOST IMPORTANT:<P>1. Mana regeneration rate.  Iksar and Trolls tied here due to regenned HP changed to mana via the Cannibalize line.<BR>2. Armor Class.  End game, Iksar have a significant bonus.  Their innate bonus comes very close to making up for any equipment problems.<BR>3. Mana Pool.  Iksar have a large starting WIS bonus... 10 to barbs, 13 to ogres, 20 to Trolls.  If you want to say "yes, but anyone can get 200," you're not using your head.  EVERY EXTRA INNATE WIS POINT IS ONE YOU DON'T NEED TO USE GEAR FOR AND CAN PUT GOOD AC (or +mana) IN THAT SLOT INSTEAD.  Not to mention that in general it's not that easy for shamans to get that 200 without giving up AC.  To keep a good AC, it took both the epic AND bearform for me to finally hit 200 wis... at level 56.<P>If you want to point to stuff like the ogre no-stun and say "Well, that makes up for it," you're deluding yourself.  Not all bonuses are equal.  Do you think Iksar would be as good if we ditched their regen and gave them no-stun?  Come on.<P>-------<P>On buffs: If you recall I wrote the long post on the Vision on shamans that helped get this whole rigamarole started.  I have to go back to my essential point: buffs are NOT the primary ability of shamans.  Debuffing is what we do.  This may not be from intentional design decisions, but under the way the game is now structured, that's how it is.  There are only two things that could happen at this point to change that:<BR>* give us AC/HP/haste buffs that would make the clerics and enchanters scream bloody murder; or<BR>* re-do game mechanics to make statistics have a SIGNIFICANT combat effect.<P>Neither of these are going to happen.  I'm totally accepting of that.  What needs to be concentrated on is our real strengths.  As far as buffs go, the group buffs should be fixed.  Past that, forget it.<P>----------<P>DoT damage: Actually, I don't know anyone who has a problem with the damage outlay of Pox.  It's a significant upgrade (IF you can find it).  It just shares the problem of the rest of the disease line, that 2 minutes is longer than most fights.<BR>Bane of Nife is the one that needs the damage upgrade.  It's really not all that much better than ebolt, 7 long levels earlier.<P>---------<P>My list of fizzlers (through 56): Rage, Talismans of Shadoo/Jacinth, Superior Heal, Cannibalize 3, Torrent of Poison, Acumen.<P>---------<P>The problem with alchemy is basically two-part:<BR>1. The vendor buyback rate is totally insignificant.  It's in the neighborhood of 20% compared to 90%+ for Jewelcraft.  (This is not to say we want to MAKE money selling potions to vendors, we just don't want to lose virtually every cent we toss in).<BR>2. There's NO general-sale potions between 70 (Shrink) and 170 (Gate).  NOTHING in that range sells, because they're far too expensive (haste, regeneration, AC for example) or have virtually no or extremely limited utility (stat adjustment potions).  Nobody will pay to move their stats up and down with an expendable item.  The only things to make in that range are resist potions for dragon raids, and that's not something to sell regularly.<P>So, you can get your skill to 70 by making things people want and selling to them, but then you're stuck because nobody wants to buy the stuff you have to make to advance, and that includes NPC vendors.  One of these two strings has to be broken to fix alchemy.<P>-----------<P>Spells that drop just plain too rarely: Bane, Pox, Tirgir.  I'm going to make a case that either Bane OR Pox should be a buyable spell.  The only real shaman spell-based offense is the DoT, and we have NO buyable DoTs post-50 (not to mention they both are very rare).  Druids and Necros BOTH get purchasable DoT spells.  What happened to the purchasable spells being the core ones?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

And as for having the best of all shaman abilities , the large races have an average of 150-250 more hitpoints than iksars because of the stamina difference. I must say all around very invalid argument. To be honest i dont think we should wear jb armor anyway, but should have a quest or drop equivalent, maybe a right clickable poison zap?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ABSOR PLEASE READ! <P>If you read the posts prior to this you would see that 60 % of every post asked for a lure line of slow spells. Our raid life is very trivial, we add placebo buffs, and a few semi important ones.We don't try and heal as is , because any caster that would need our heals would be dead before it got to them. I doubt our raid viability is to resist buff? Our real usefulness in raid and high level situations is to slow and malise hands down. Which if you ever have played a high end shaman , you would know this is a co dependant issue. Without an enchanter present i would have to say we have a 10 percent chance of malising or slowing a mob before it dies! Malise NEEDS to be made a disease resist spell, that way teamed with our insidious decay(a normally non usefull spell) we wont NEED an enchanter to tashan a mob before we can do our real job. In case you werent aware our spells are EXTREME taunts, and usually guarantee death on any epic mobs. If malise is made to disease it will allow us to , insidious decay (debuff disease by 40), malise (lower resistances by around 30 average), then maybe be able to stick a slow on the mob, assuming he hasnt been summoned and splattered at this point, which paves the way for another shaman to get the job done.<BR>Healing:<BR>Ok so you dont want us to infringe on a clerics teritory by giving us better heals.I actuality i dont see why not? Do you really think that clerics will be any less wanted for their complete heal, Best ac and hp buffs, and resurection abilities? In all fairness i dont see why he dont get superior at 44, and a celestial healing clone(mini-torpor), is it too much to ask that shamans be wanted and usefull in a group too. I am so sick of groups only wanting the big 5 classes(monk, rogue , warior, cleric , enchanter)In a MMRPG , shouldnt we have an environment where anyone should be wanted and not be "just a replacement". "just a replacement" do you understand how that feels, i mean sure we arent supposed to be clerics, we have other usefull abilities , but i was under the assumption healing was to be one of them. And im sorry with the tools givin we "CAN'T" do that job. No group can be sufficient without a cleric and only one shaman. I would expect, or in RL demand, that i at least be able to keep my group alive, although not as effectively as a cleric. Slightly off subject here, but if clerics get a healing bonus to all spells , and other classes have healing, why shouldnt the shaman class have a bonus to our buffing ablilities, that way our abilities though cloned on others armors and such, would at least be slightly effective.<P>Points Made, because im sure you dont actually read these!<P>1.) Healing : Much closer to clerics , to promote need in a group,and break of cleric healing monopoly.(and Absolute essentialness)<P>2.)Malise : Make it disease based , allowing our insidious decay to be of use. Also will allow us to potentially insect a mob without an enchanter having to tashan first.<P>3.) Lure insects spell : making us usefull , but not overpowering on raids. Possibly an irresistable 25 % speed reducer?<P>4.)Lots of minor spell fixes and upgrages because of stacking, you have most on list wont cover them again. The inforced Feign death on torpors isnt a bad idea, just make it more battle casteable, so we can save someones life (i.e) a casters in a heated battle. I think taking someone out of a battle for 30 seconds makes up for saving his life.(a cleric can epic a person back to life in 30 secs(if its a caster they can cast again and have no previous aggroe)), so wouldnt be too much to ask, i meanit is level a level 60 spell.<P>5.) Sit for 2 minutes and actually "THINK" what it is like to only be a replacement for another class. Do it! You may understand some of our points of view. In a game of such epic proportions i would expect to see class favoritism to be a personal opinion, not an essential aspect of the game! the team with the cleric lives and prospers, the team without is bound to die and need a clerics help anyway!shouldnt 2 "backup" healers be able to do 1 persons job more effectively? not less effectively?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First, I applaud your efforts on these class talks Absor and hope to see some good things come of them.<P>I firmly believe that in addition to the points you listed in your summary, shaman str, agi and dex buffs and debuffs need to be addressed. Shaman don't need to be turned into Jr clerics to be effective in the 50+ game. Imagine the result if shaman were able to do what they're supposed to do. Imagine if a str buff allowed the tanks to hit MUCH harder and agi/dex buffs allowed PCs to hit more often and be hit MUCH less. Imagine further that our debuffs actually weakened mobs so they could be hit more and take more melee damage. And while we're imagining things, imagine that our malo line actually stuck on it's target and PC casters could land spells much more reliably and deliver much more damage. The net result would be a far superior survival factor for the group with a shaman on board. <P>As it stands, groups can't survive without the required cleric. I submit that this requirement be expanded to all three healing classes, but let each perform the function in their own way. Clerics by virtue of their supperior healing powers, shaman by virtue of their buffing/debuffing powers and druids by virtue of what ever it is they're good at (obviously I've never played a druid).  <P>The points you listed in your summary certainly need to be looked at and will help a great deal, but tossing extra heals on shaman in my opinion may be the easiest thing to do, but it is not the best solution to the problem.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I was just reading some of the posts since I was here yesterday. Two points really stuck out to me that were made here. So, I wanted to echo my support for these two things.<P>First, if our stat buffs (str, dex, agi, and stam) actually made the sort of difference they *should* (i.e. increasing damage output, and decreasing the damage taken by melee classes), we wouldn’t really need upgraded healing abilities. This is because we could effectively prevent damage from being taken in the first place by increasing offense (things die faster and thus do less damage) and defense (pure damage prevention).<P>If this were done, we wouldn’t be stepping on Cleric turf. I don’t want to be an extraordinary healer; that’s a Cleric’s job. I want to be an extraordinary buffer and de-buffer; if this were done right I would be just as effective as a Cleric, but in a different way.<P>Second, we need to know why, when probably better than half of us identified lack of stat buff effectiveness as a major (if not *the major*) issue, why it is not mentioned by Absor. If it is something that cannot be fixed because the programming is too complex, we need to know *now* so that we can discuss options.<P>I am a 49 Shaman and I just counted my stat buff spells; I have 23 (and I think I skipped buying a couple). TWENTY THREE! If we are not to be the buffers our “vision” makes us out to be, we need to remake that “vision” into something workable. I would like to see these 23 spells replaced with something useful, something in line with a redefined “vision” of Shaman, if that is what’s necessary. But, I would really rather not see it come to that, I would really rather be the buffer I am *supposed to be*.<P>Regards</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm gona start off with the important stuff first:<P>     Stats definitely need to be addressed and reassessed to see if they should be considered a class defining ability.  Dots need to be less resistable at the higher end game since most mobs have to be debuffed immensely to guarantee the spell to stick.<BR>     Iksars should be able to use jaundice bone armor.(Reason being since different races are balanced by stats/abilities, NOT armor)  <P>     In fact, a fully equipped iksar shm in Kunark (Ac armor) armor will have 888-895 ac unbuffed and 151 wis.  Thats the max ac he can hit not counting velious/VP.<P>     So thus verant put in new armor(In veloius of course making almost any iksar HAVE to buy the expansion) to address iksar shaman that had good ac but crap for wis(compare treeweave 25 ac 10 str(Highest ac bp for iksar) compared to the jaundice bone(35 ac 13 or so wis, right click effect with ac, and lots of other stats). Iksar would get about 40 ac off the bp while other shaman would get about 55 ac off their bp, easily making up for the extra ac of being iksar along with destroying any lead the iksar had in wis over the other less wise races.<P>So PLEASE, lets remain on the task at hand, quit flaming iksar just because they want to be as good as you.  After all, not every meleer is the same race just because they wana be the best tank, they just wana be a tank.  Same goes for shamans.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Below is the summary of Alans replys to our concerns.<BR>I'll ask into it. But keep in mind that trade skills are designed to only be profitable when items are sold to players. But if the return isn't at least reasonable when selling to vendors, I'll see if I can find out why.<P>~ultravision at 5 plat a pop anyone?~<P>I'll look into it. But my first thought is that Velious is designed to be hard to get to, so that's unlikely. And, well, it might not be the intent of Alchemy to reduce the need to have a wizard or druid to zap you around the globe.<P>Personally, I think it's fine as is. But feel free to try to convince me otherwise.<P>Again, it seems like a great spell to me. Perhaps others can wade in here and explain to me why this isn't a good spell. Keep in mind that stacking is a very complicated issue.<P>~My personal Favorite is below~<BR>Not all spells will be 'A' list spells. There's no real reason to remove this spell. Heck, if you're playing with a lot of bards…<P>I'll look into it and see if these are, in fact, oversights or if they are as intended. It's not so obvious to me…<P>Keep in mind that monsters don’t have much, er… volume, so they can be stacked very close together. This doesn't seem like something that needs to be changed.<P>~Quick get that train close together so i can tigir it!, oh wait i need to find the spell first cause its so rare no one has it!~<P>defining class spells will be available at the vendors<P>~Gee so slow (tigirs) and dots are not a class defining ability of shamans...~<P>Sounds right to me, for the most part. I have a disagreement with point #2, but I'll get to that in a second.But <P>I'm willing to accept your comments as they are, even if I might not believe in them as strongly as you do.<P>Actually, I had always thought that enchanters were supposed to be the masters of debuffing. For me, the current setup seems just right on this account<P>Goodness, pets again! But, essentially, pets for shaman work as intended, right? They add a bit of damage and tanking, and they look cool.<P>All 'secondary' powerful spells like that have a bit more fizzle to them. You're not alone in that. And it is, frankly, just another drawback to the spell. Personally, I'm not sure that shaman should have superior healing… it's not unlike giving mages Malosi…<P>~Yah shamans dont need SH naa, we just need 1/6th of the EQ population to play sit on our as$ lathargic legged clerics~<P>Confusion! You don't get he upgrades at all, or you're disappointed with them…<P>I looked it up. They seem to be there. In fact, here's what Everlore says about Pox of Bertoxxulous:<P>"This is believed to be the best DoT in game. It is the last Shaman DoT, doing close to 2100 damage."<P><BR>~I wont even justify this with a response, ok you twisted my arm, yah the best dot in the game requires a debuff to be used that still gets resisted after debuff and takes 2 mins to work, do you get all your EQ knowledge from everlore? sure seems so to me~<P>I know… I know. We're still looking into this one.<P>I disagree with the minor update thing. And, well, if you agree that shaman were perhaps on the top few rungs at 50, then how else would you suggest we upgrade them?<P>~why suggest anything at all, if anyone is following your responses here everything is right, you know all and players know jack~<P>I don't want to make this into an item discussion… I really think those sorts of things are best served in a different thread. But I'll mention this to the team as well.<P>Alan<P>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<BR>My opinion is your replys suck, all issues that shamans are concerned about you shoot down with a smart as$ reply, at the risk of losing some meaning to this post I will leave you with this note: You and me(alan) in a dark alley.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have a level 53 Shaman among several other classes.  These are my views on the original posted items.  At no point do I bash anyone else's views.

Also, is there any way we can keep duelers from losing experience points when DOTs are employed?<P>ITEM: Group buffs.<BR>DESCRIPTION: Yes I'd like to see group buffs at the same power with greater duration.  I'd also like to see 51+ buffs have a similar duration as Shrink, but dispellable (i.e. permanent until dispelled or the recipient dies, zones, goes LD, etc.).<P>ITEM: Fizzles on higher level spells.<BR>DESCRIPTION: Again, I'd like to see fizzle rates nonexistant once a caster has maxed out casting abilities for that spell at 51 (spell casting can still be interrupted).<P>ITEMS: Alchemy.<BR>DESCRIPTION: I like everything that was in the original post.  I'd also like to see component costs lowered as this would benefit everyone.<P>ITEM: Pets.<BR>DESCRIPTION: I want to say here that I think the outdoor/indoor only limitations for spells of all casters should be eliminated.  That was cruel to do that to Druids and make them so much less effective indoors and therefore less effective in groups.<P>ITEM: Torpor.<BR>DESCRIPTION: I like making this spell stackable with regen spells.<P>ITEM: Stacking of Curse of Spirits.<BR>DESCRIPTION: I'd like to see this DOT stack with all other DOTs.

</FONT><HR>I am a wizard but would be interested in what other caster think about this post to the wizard board.<P>TO THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM VIA ABSOR<P>ITEM: mana regeneration <P>THIS is a REQUIRED for all casters NOW to begin the balance of the caster versus melee imbalance that exists. This is needed for all levels as the trickle down of better gear pre-kunark to melee class has skewed the basic caster melee equation into the low thirties. The trickle down of gear from velious is just beginning and its effects will further skew this imbalance to even lower levels and make the midlevels worse than they are now.<P>A token fix here will produce no good results. You guys study this in combination with efficiency and resists to ALL casters. This is not an option but a necessity in the entire life of the caster.<P>ITEM: Spell efficiency<P>SEE ABOVE AND IS REQUIRED FOR ALL CASTER CLASSES FROM ONE TO SIXTY FOR THE SAME REASONS. Forget about the damage of mages, druids, and necros compared to wizards. FIX the caster imbalance first then work on the individual class differences in your vision of them. DO NOT<BR>fix class imbalance before you fix the basic caster=melee imbalance. <P>The scientific method (and its clear you are not using this) requires that the basic sides of an equation must be equal first, then changes to one side of that equation must be met by an opposite but equal change on the other side of the equation.<P>YOU have a basic desing flaw now because of a lack of understanding of the basic equation for the game. YOU FIXED ONE SIDE OF THE EQUATION SINCE BEFORE KUNARK WAS BEING DESIGNED AND NEVER TOUCHED THE CASTER SIDE. KUNARK AND POST 50 PLAY INCREASED THAT GAP. STILL FURTHER ENHANCEMENT OF THE MELEE SIDE OF THE EQUATION AND INEFFECTIVE CASTER FIXES(NON RECOGNITION OF THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM OF THE ORIGINAL FLAW STILL WORKING ITS WAY DOWN) PUSHED THE ENVELOPE FURTHER AS VELIOUS WAS RELEASED. <P>SURELY YOU REALIZE NOW THAT ALTHOUGH THE CASTER FIXES WERE NICE, THEY WERE WAY BEHIND THE MELEE CURVE FOR BALANCE.<P>VEILIOUS AND ITS INEVITABLE TRICKLE DOWN WILL ONLY MAKE IT WORSE.<P>BALANCE THE BASIC EQUATION IF YOU CAN,THEN WORRY ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL CLASSES. THESE ARE TWO SEPARATE ISSUES AND YOU MUST BALANCE THE BASIC EQUATION BEFORE ATTEMPTING THE CLASS BALANCE.<P>ITEM: Percentage damage spells<P>Same as above.<P>ITEM: Level cap on spells<P>Put same level cap on melee where they simple cannot damage a mob at all or remove it from the caster side of the equqation.<P>ITEM: Alkabor<P>This has nothing to do with balance, forget about it. They suck and you cant fix em. The game is not geared to ae play on any scale with overcrowded servers. It makes no sense to crowd an already crowded game.<P>ITEM: Flaming Sword<P>Leave it alone and we can let it go to last page of never used spells where it is now. NOT an issue for balancing the basic Melee Caster equation. Mages and Necros have their pet=better sword and thats just fine with me and prolly most wizards.<P>I mean, what the hell is the point of the thing??/<P>ITEM:Harvest<P>A WIZARD specific item that needs improvement but needs to be considered in with the basic caster melee equation and issuse in the first two items.<P>ITEM: RAIN spells<P>AGAIN refer to first two items. FIXING a specific damage spell needs to be considered within the basic melee caster equation first.<P>ITEM: Atol's <P>WHAT is the fizzle thing post 50 in a caster class that is way behind already. Fizzles got worse post kunark. ELIMINATE fizzles post 50. What is the point. Give a resonable explaination of this??????? What is the logic here for balance and fun.<P>LOOK AT FIZZLES ALONG WITH RESISTS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FIRST TWO ITEMS OF THIS POST AND FOR GOODNESS SAKE, GET REAL.<P>ITEM:Snare/enstill<P>Most wizards never use em work on item one and two above first priority. To heck with em, none of this line is usefull to a wizard now. Fix them later, fix balance first.<P>ITEM: invis vs undead<P>A comment like " I dont know why wizards get this in the first place" is not reguarded as an answer unless followed by because ........<P>I don't know why a paladin, enchanter, etc etc get it either.<P>ITEM:TELEPORT<P>Not the basic problem fix in later<P>ITEM: fade, shadowstep, and yonder<P>DOH<P>ITEM:Evacs, Abscond etc<P>Secondary problem should have been fixed at implementation if they were tested at all by the test team. FIZZLES are incomprehensible as stated above.<P>ITEM: Melee Proof mobs<P>DOH DOH DOH Somebody get him off me??? Somebody get him off me ???? Whats the point here ?????<P>ITEM Diamond Rod<P>Most wizards could give a hoot. Balance the basics first, you have a ton of pre 50 play crap like this, fix it when you can. If you do anything let it cast mannaskin the preferred post 50 skin.<P>ITEM: Imbue fire opal<P>If you dont have the right god who cares??<P>ITEM: Eye of zomm<P>DOH.

</FONT><HR>I don't know what meds Absor is taking, but I want some.<P>Five major problems suggest themselves.<BR>1) Post 50 spells are not dropping or are near useless<BR>   1.a) Torpor, this 'healing' spell can kill a tank if cast in combat. A shaman will be banned from a raid for using this spell.<BR>   1.b) Avatar, this spell suffers from the stat problem. It takes a 30 to 40 point rise in a stat to see a 1% to 2% increase in effect.<BR>   1.c) Group buffs suffer the stat problem and the fact that they are less effective than single buffs.<P>2) Druids and Shamen are equal healers untill 60. Torpor doesn't count as it isn't cast. With the proposed changes druids will now be equal to shamen untill 59, then druids will be much better healers. Go ahead and give druids Torpor and shamen the Natures Touch spell. Or just make Torpor useful.<P>3) Stat buffs suck. At 30 a single cast of Quickness is more effective than blowing half a bar of mana on buffs. 1% to 5% more damage, 5 to 20 AC, 1% to 2% more procs, less than 5% more HP. Match the effect with the stat buff. Compare a 25% haste spell to 4 buff spells, which one is 4 times more useful?<P>4) Alchemy. SoW, ITU, Shrink, Gate to 3 of 4 shaman areas. Do I need to say anything else? Go to the trade skill forum and look for Alchemy Talk, if anything else needs to be said it will be said there.<P>5) Rage line of spells has been reduced to a self buff. In the beginning it was cool and useful, not for the stats but for the regen and any possible haste (never confirmed this). Now it is as useful as any other buff, less than 5%.<P>If you would like to, give Enchanters our slow line. Give us a 60% effect and 40% cost slow line. This will make them the masters of hastes and slows.<BR>Then revamp the Cripple spells. Make them resist aginst Disease and debuff the AC and damage of the mob. At mid levels the AC would drop by half and the damage by 20% to 30%. After 45 make it AC by 30% and damage by half. The 60 level spell could be half on both of them.<P>If you fix the first five problems then shamen will be happy. The last suggestion is a little wild, but might be an idea to kick around.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>While you have caught a few of the items of interest, I'm afraid that you've missed the spirit of Shaman's core complaints in order to simplify them into an easily implementable list.  What you've missed is the fact that Shaman were a powerful and viable class from levels 1-49, with decent (or better) damage through DoTs; a reasonably solid pet (when played carefully with taunts off); moderate buffs (focusing on AC, HP, and maybe even haste); and powerful (group oriented) debuffs (I'm focusing on speed primarily).  In the post 50 game, VI nerfed Shaman capabilities, resulting in a Shaman class that is but a shadow of its former self.  For example:<P>1) Togors was nerfed to make room for Turgurs post 50.  Turgurs is only slightly better (in effect) than the Togors of old.  However, because the resist rates for higher level mobs (even in Kunark) are much higher, this spell can often not be landed without an enchanter dropping Tashania on the mob.  <P>Issue:  Slow spells are the most effective indirect healing capability that Shaman have, IMO, in the current game.  However, if not able to be landed until an enchanter has finished crowd control duties and is sufficiently satisfied that a mob won't agro on them, we're not likely to be able to stick the spell until the second half of the fight (once the fight is "safe" for the group.  To be useful, we need to be able to land the spell early, BEFORE the chanter has finished crowd control.  This would allow us to HELP keep both the chanter and tank alive...<P>Recommendation:  Shaman need a usable (read low resist) MR or combo (like the Malo line) debuff rather than the useless one we have now.  This would allow us to land our Turgurs line and give us a viable role in the "high level" party.  If your and the "balance gods" feel that Turgurs is too overwhelming, then provide a lower effect slow spell that is low resist.  This is key!<P>2)  Buffs:  Shaman currently get moderate capability AC/HP buffs, "the best" stat buffs, the same resist buffs as all the clerical classes, and low powered haste buffs (usually 2 or more generations behind the chanter).  However, you have referred to Shaman as the "king of buffs".  Can you develop some reasonable rationale for your position?  Realistically, Shaman are the "kings" of stat buffs, on par or inferior to or on par with other classes for the majority of other PHYSICAL buffs.  Enchanters have been the "kings" of mental buffs (e.g., MR, WIS, INT), but for some reason VI has seen fit to also make them the kings of haste (which would seem to be physical to me).<P>Issue:  Stat buffs have been shown, time and again, to be nearly useless in effect.  If you won't take the relatively scientific analysis presented in the log parsing on The Shaman's Crucible, then at least humor us and conduct some experimentation yourself!  This is the ONLY area where Shaman are the "kings" of the buff arena.<P>Recommendation:  Do something, anything, to make stat buffs really valuable and meaningful.  I can tell you from extensive personal experience that tanks "like to see icons on their screen and big numbers in their stats".  I spend a tremendous amount of time throwing these very expensive (in mana terms) spells and end up cannibalizing for a long time after buffing all the tanks in the 2-3 groups that we often take raiding, where I'm the only Shaman.  There have been a number of suggestions on how to make stat buffs relevant and meaningful, please consider implementing one or more of them.  While you're at it, how about consider adding an "all in one" buff (with appropriate mana cost) that buffs all the stats (and stacks) in a single icon to help us save buff space.  How about also consider throwing us a bone and increasing the capability we have with the other "physical buffs" like haste to be a single generation behind the chanter, like they are (when compared to us) with slow...  Also, please consider adding group versions for our other resist buffs (e.g., fire, cold, etc.) in addition to the couple that you already have.<P>3) Stacking. For goodness sakes, make our "ultimate" buffs (and FA weapon effect) stack or overwrite spells of lesser capability.  In addition to the other discussions on this board, I came to find out that our FA effect does not stack with the "clockwork poison" proc from the "off hand only" weapon (sorry but I can't remember its name) dropped by Renux.  This is supposed to be our "epic" item and the effect can't be utilized in so many situations it's sick.<P>4) Spell drops:  I think this has been hit enough times, but I couldn't help but include it.  However, please add "Form of the Great Bear" to the list.  I can't see how this spell is so overpowering that it should be gathering "trade only" status on Xegony and only drops from named Dragons in WW and is a rare drop from PoG.<P>5) Fizzles:  ALL of our 50+ spells fizzle too much.  My list contains (from a L55 perspective) Canni 3, Torrent of Poison, Superior Heal, Talisman of Jasinth, and Talisman of Shadoo.  I think a number of other spells have also been addressed by the other, higher level, Shaman elsewhere in this forum.<P>6) Cannibalize:  Can you say "carpal tunnel syndrome"?  Please raise the hp/mana taken by this spell to a reasonable level...  I suggest, perhaps, a half bubble of life (about 180 hp for an unbuffed L55 Shaman) in a cast?<P>Summing it all up, I very nearly retired my Shaman yesterday after a trip to the Myconid King in Sebilis.  I'm a L55 Shaman on Xegony.  In the space of about 6 hours (all that I was able to stand before logging for the night), I AVERAGED three casts of Turgurs (750 mana) to land the spell.  This number would have been larger, but my wife (who plays a L57 enchanter) would often cast a Tashania before the fight was over (as stated above, this was AFTER the room was safe).  My worst fight required 1500 mana to stick one.  BTW, I started casting Malosi in between each Turgurs so I could write a meaningful message to you today.  The result, in general, was that "if I could stick Malosi, I could also stick Turgurs without it".  Numerous times, the Malosi would fail to stick after Turgurs stuck.  This is broken.  In my frustration at "feeling useless", I nearly alienated my entire guild, who kindly enough helped me finish my FA this past Friday.  Imagine their surprise when I started griping that it was useless because I couldn't land our effect if our tank was using Renux's weapon, our Necro used Asystole or Splurt, or our enchanter used choke.  The pinnacle of Shaman gear, I think not, if it's overwritten by a L51 Necro spell...  <P>Needless to say, I spent a great deal of time smashing my Canni 3 hot key.  BTW, the worst fizzle I saw in this 6 hours was 6 in a row...  I also fizzled Torrent 8 times straight...  That's right, 8 straight...<P>Absor, I can't stress enough how frustrating it has become trying to play a Shaman.  I suggest that your "balance gods" give it a shot.  Why not put together a few of your own encounters with arbitrary distribution of character classes in even non-raid type situations and see exactly how frustrating the Shaman has become!  We're not even talking about the insane mobs in SoV.  This is a relatively "safe" encounter for 2 groups of 53+ with a decent puller and yet I was rendered nearly completely impotent.  I didn't like the feeling!  Please help restore some feeling of importance and uniqueness to the Shaman class.<P>BTW, did you know that (in addition to all the other Shaman unique capabilities that have been arbitrarily passed to other classes) the Shaman only Cannibalize 2 spell has been added to a cleric-only staff from the Western Wastes?<P>Gunch Bludmist<BR>Shaman of the 55th Season (which may be my last)<BR>Xegony<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
