</FONT><HR>Perhaps you are already role-playing, and didn't know it. I tend to just relax and play myself. Your character is a merchant/paladin, and that's fine. You could create a history for yourself if you wanted to. And you could give yourself a personality fluke or two if you wished. Tirra doesn't like to hunt wolves because the barbarians are the Wolves of the North. <P>Role-playing varies by definition. Some folks insist on saying everything in character- speaking as they would for real, and have elaborate stories worked out for how and why things happen. Others just go with the flow and try to be polite & use complete sentences. I role-play the latter style.<P>-Tirra da barbie</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Roleplay..<P>This is the 'art'? of being your character..<P>When you play a Dwarf Paladin, and you just go into the game and be yourself then you are playing EQ as a advanced 'doom' style game. (let me say at this time there is NOTHING wrong with this).<P>The game itself is a roleplaying game.. which basically means.. and im going to use Roleplaying stereo types because they are easier to explain..<P>A paladin should not associate himself with those of evil (i.e. necro's of ANY race, shadowknights, ogres, trolls, iksar and darkelves).. because they are evil and he is the ultimate defender of truth and justice and of GOOD.. his enemy is all evil and the undead..<P>I refused flat to group with those for many many many levels.. Ask Ashara and Sasandra.. im sure i drove them up the wall with it..<P>Each race and class has a stereo type way of being played and these are the easiest to explain, but im leaving work in 10 mins so i wont go into them all..<P>But Dwarves, lawful chappies not prone to being chaotic and 'crazy' but do have some notible berserkers in their history.. tend to be greedy and grumpy but with a good heart and a loyal soul..<P>Elves high, tend to be so self absorbed that they deem themselves above the other races, in intelect and skill in all things.. brutal warrior types can disgust these elves.. and the stubborn and gruff dwarves.. well.. what can you say.. tho good align'd their loftiness can cause tension with the other good races but in the end they will ALL fight side by side against the darkelves and their enemies..<P>Halfings fun loving lil guys.. tend to make VERY good home makers, but some get the urge to travel and see all the nice exciting things the big people all talk about.. cheeky and mischeovous these lil guys can be a pain as much as a help!<P><BR>Classes and asome basic stereo types..<P>Shadowknight, warrior of evil.. blessed by their deity with powers of necromaning to combat good ultimate defenders the paladins.. you are the elite of the darks forces and as such have great powers over the undead.<P>Mage, the elementalist, the magical power of the four elements, firee,air,water,earth are yours to command.. summon creatures made from the purest form of these elements to command and defend you in combat.. your spells tends to involve the summoning of these elements in various forms or combinations..<P>Cleric, the healer and protector of their faith.. not all clerics heal for th better good.. darkelves for instance can keep a victim alive for years using just enough healing power to prevent their torture from bringing blessed death to their victims..<P>etc etc etc... i can run up a bigger and more in depth over view of all the races anbd their relationships in the world of norrath if people feel like a long read?<P>ill also do the classes as well.. some of the EQ stuff differs slightly from the stereo types from say AD+D but ive done my research.. also it might nice for some poeple to better under stand the concept of roleplaying..<P>Titan,</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't think there are major problems with just being oneself, thou needs not speak thusly.<P>Roleplaying means keeping out of game chatter and game mechanics chatter to a minimum. It means following the naming rules.<P>Also, I think you need to stay in character in terms of some things that you do. By taking a particular role you are making a bargain to act within that role. Druids and rangers do not spend their time hunting peaceful bears--there are limits, that won't stop them from hunting lions in karana if they go aggro on you. <P>Good characters do not group with evil ones, generally speaking. When I have grouped with an evil character (I'm a 1/2elf druid btw), I have generally expressed my displeasure through a variety of jokes and minor taunts and have done so only when in a large group and for a purpose. I have turned down evil races for groupings--which has been painful because the trolls and ogres are almost all roleplayed to the hilt (why else would you play one). As a half-elf I do not group with dark elves--period. In fact, I taunt them at ever opportunity and I've had some great interactions with them. <P>There are also limits imposed by the game system--if we have to refer to game elements, we have to do so and it seems pointless to me to try to fake them, particularly in the heat of battle. I'm sure in the "real world" of Norrath, people wouldn't scream "TRAIN TO ZONE!" but given the need to warn people, I don't think it's poor taste to do so. I'll also say OOM if I see someone running off to pull something, because the guy's probably going to have something coming before I can think and compose "hark, my magical energies are fading, I must rest and seek the power of the earth to replenish myself." OTOH if we're about to leave a city, I might put it that way. I do try to keep most of my out of character speech to tells or group tho (obviously TRAIN! is an exception). And I do extensively chat in the OOC channel.<P>I tend to roleplay the most in downtime, while I'm in cities, and when I meet people for the first time. <P>It's about getting into the environment of the game. Frankly, I've played videogames for over 20 years at this point. EQ isn't a very good one. If you want to bash and powerlevel, Diablo 2 is far superior. If you want to frag, UT or Q3 has way better gameplay, not to mention the hamburger flying thru the air. The point of EQ is to get into the world, into your character, and into an alternative state of mind--I'm not saying one can't play it another way, but I will say there are better games if you're looking for something else.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Not much to add in General, but I'll tell you how I play my Dwarf. Generally, I view him as a Lawful Neutral character. I turn no one away, as long as you adhere to the rules of the group (the lawful part). Ninja looters get booted REAL quick.<P>1) Thee's and Thou's are for those Snooty High Elves and Erudites. Bah! Dwarves don't talk like that. Would sound stupid if you ask me... (no offense, just an in character thing hehehe... Keep in mind, my favorite Alternate character is a High Elf  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"> )<P>2) I'm a dwarf. I love a good drink, I sing baudy drinking songs, I'm gruff, grumpy, and abrupt. "Wha? Ye donna like it? Bah, go jump off a cliff ya bag o' bricks." "Get yer stinking backside outta my face tubby! I canna even see the damn Orc!" (to an ogre in Crushbone  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif">  YES, I actually had this conversation. It was a Hoot! LOL He played it to the hilt!, and we had a good /OOC chat going in /tell )<P>3) I need armor, I need weapons. THIS is most warriors major focus. "You damnable mages, Always sittin on yer ass. (said whiny) I need mana, my power is depleted, whine whine whine... Me axe is sharp, and stays that way, lets go damn it! Ye can study yer friggin book while we run!"<P>4) Gold, Platinum, Jewels... the more the better. ( Now, I don't ninja loot, and I'm not greedy in groups, but I'll pick up EVERYTHING I can sell that's worth more than a couple coppers hehehe... )<P>I am a dwarf (Grumpy, greedy sometimes, blunt and abrupt). I am a Warrior (No silence here, I make a lot of noise, I clank when I walk, I charge into battle, I end up with a LOT of blood on my armor). I focus on combat. (Now, I enjoy the sunsets, and the cool visuals, of statues, buildings, whatever... But my Dwarf says thing like "Bah, whatever, and so?" when people talk about the scenery "In Character" If it's stonework, he'll stop and admire it, or a finely crafted weapon or armor, but what does he care about sunsets, or forest, or grasslands??? /ooc, heck yeah, I think most of EQ is visually very cool.<P>Anyway, that's rambling and disjointed, but you get the idea. Roleplay is what you make of it. K3\/\/L D00d L33+ $p34k is NOT roleplay...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"> Though EQ is billed as a "Roleplaying" game, most people just play for fun, and don't care about roleplay. Their choice, but in /say, and /group, I'm always in Roleplay mode. If I have something /ooc to say I ((bracket)) it like that. *shrug*<P>Geez, does this make sense? I'm rambling bad! Must... Have...

</FONT><HR>I no longer try to roleplay in the traditional "actor playing a part" kind of way. I also have yet, ever, to be in a group where any memeber roleplayed any kind of racial antipathy except for humor. (I.E. every group I've ever been in would add an Iksar SK to fight alongside the human paladin and the dark elf cleric would heal both of them without batting an eyelid).<P>However, I find that I play all my characters very differently according to their class and, most especially, their race, without making any conscious attempt to do so.<P>For example, Magottypie the gnome mage gabbles constantly, runs about and gets underfoot. I do about three times the typing playing him than I do playing any other character.<P>Raychel, human druid, is much quieter, tends to keep her opinions to herself, but is very principled and will leave a group almost immediately if they propose doing something she disapproves of (like killing NPCs).<P>Elderberri the barbarian shaman, however, really does not suffer fools gladly and will take anyone to task for not being up to the mark, being bossy, disorganised or pretty much anything she happens to take exception to.<P>I did not choose to play these characters this way, but I believe the classes and races have ben so well designed that one is led into doing so almost subliminally - certainly I see a very great congruence in attitude and style amonge the many representatives of each race and class I group with,almost despite the intent of players not to engage in roleplay.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>LOL Balkin, I am still rambling but if I have any more coffee I’ll explode!<P>In my overblown opinion, a good RPer creates a character with motives and rules that the character lives by.  It’s kinda like acting in a very limited yet connected way.  For example, Cameron Diaz isn’t Mary, nor Laura (Very Bad Things) nor is she Lottie  (Being John Malcovich) but I am sure some part of her went into creating each of these characters.  Same with RPing…but we don’t get paid and we probably don’t put as much effort into it.  <P>SO…whether you play a ‘Thy kind is but an affront to mein eyes, Darkelf’ sort of character or just a character who is mostly yourself (can we say Al Pachino?) and you are true to the tenants you set up for that character then you are role playing.  Now, if you play 100% yourself is that really role playing?  Can you count yourself as a role?  True stickler RPers will say Absolutely Not! But my brain is too fuzzy to come up with an answer.<P>I would like to add though, that role playing can get very washed out if every dwarf is grumpy, every troll is stupid etc.  I once jumped all over a guild’s message board (in character) for their refusal to admit a troll to their ranks because he did not speak ‘troll-speak’ and therefor was not RPing (they prided themselves on being an RP guild).  It’s nice to see a character who is played outside the stereotypes of their class or race or who has some other depth beyond “I’m a paladin, I am noble”<P>As far as EQ being an RP game, I am just not seeing it.  Maybe one in about 100 people RP and the majority of that is RP-lite.  Not because all the RP sucks but because the game makes it very very hard to continue in the vein of RP-ness.  I standardly say things like 30M, LM, OOM, Please sound off your class and buffed HPs…etc. that my character would not say but since EQ is a real time game sometimes you need to get info across fast.  Usually I save RP for down times (and guild channel which is considered all RP unless noted in brackets).<P>OK, no more coffee and no more rambling.  Just my scattered thoughts on the idea.<P>Zsalshun D’Vox, PPH<BR>Priestess to an Ugly God<BR>&lt;Winterborne&gt;<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Not much to add, not thats ever stopped me...<P>I've found RPing in EQ to be far different to what I was used to in AD&D. In D&D my backstory and goals were vital, I'd spend ages coming up with them. In EQ it can be hard to share your story when you aren't RPing with the same people all the time. Some people still do and hats off to them.<P>What I have found easier to do is just get in character.

</FONT><HR>I think I definitely role play my character, though it doesn't have much to do with how I talk.  I'm very polite - if I come into an area and somebody's already - there - even if not a group, I will ask them to make sure I'm not interfering with what they're trying to accomplish and will leave if I am. <P>I Don't intentionally group with Iksar or DE's, but won't refuse adding one to the group I'm in.  I will buy stuff for these same guys in areas where they can't shop.  That's not a classic Paladin, I know, but it is definitely within the character of MY paladin.<P>I die first - I die to save others, I die to avoid training stuff on newbies. Occasionally, I probably die unnecessarily, but that's my character and it is worth it to me to play him as he is. <P>Today at lunch I was in TR in Crushbone grouped with a 15 enchanter.  A guildmate of his - a 52 cleric - was helping us out with buffs and heals so I had some insane number of hitpoints, but at one point things got really wild, we all ended up outside and some other stuff got trained on us and I'm fighting 2 Emissaries 2 legos and a couple of cents.  Then the cleric says "oom - zone"  I said 'okay - go ahead' and stayed, planning to let them get out first.   My partner said 'zone - you will die'.  I said 'I'll make it' - I still had more than half my hit points and figured I could whack for a minute and then run (had SOW too).  I was about to make a dash for it, even had shouted 'train to zone', and I checked the emissaries - they were both way down, and I just figured, 'h*ll with it - I'm going to die standing right here'  No particular reason, except it was my character. <P>As it turned out, somebody came along and cast a couple of heals on me and I killed 'em all, then killed the trainer who jumped me on the way out of the zone, and he had the SBS on him.  And in the middle of this, I notice 'you have become better at offense' so I know I've dinged. <P>So it worked out, but if I had died I would have died happily and had a great time doing it.  Either way it was one of the best few minutes I've ever had in the game.  Those kind of fights are, to me, what the game is all about and what makes it fun.<P>Anyway, I think I roleplay my character... </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As i stated in my initial post Tann, the things i listed are the standard stereo types of those particular classes and races i listed..<P>I play a WHOLE bunch of table tops games and i see many varients..<P>For instance in Earth-Dawn the trolls are mighty (airship flying) pirates/swashbucklers/ renegades against the system but are VERY much in my eyes the 'good' guys.. Orcs are a bunch of nomadic caverly obsessed types.. although they are termed raiders they are not as such'evil'.<P>Theres i nothing wrong with playing a NON grumpy dwarf, or an understanding and socialy apt high elf or even a well spoken troll because ALL adventurering characters are somewhat out of the ordinary for their race anyways..<P>Paladins as a general rule should not imho be wandering around the globe adventuering the way i do, they should do the odd 'holy' quest and such like but should be defending their church against whatever they consider their enemies..<P>there are SOME things that just cannot be taken away from a role tho.. i.e. a druid who HATES nature would never have been granted the powers he/she has nor would a paladin who breaks his churchs code of ethics keep his powers for long.<P>Exact how much effort you put into a particular role is up to each and every person and theres is nothing wrong with lots of work or a little work.. theres nothing wrong with not playing your role at all.. this game although in the roleplay genre does not require rp'ing as apart of the game.<BR>If you enjoy the game without roleplaying then fine, both sides have to let the other do their thing tho.. i get some serious stick sometimes (and general not very polite) about some of Denekars beliefs.<P>As for logging on and just being yourself and doing what YOU what etc etc and grouping with whom YOU wish is not roleplaying (im not saying this as a roleplayer, even tho i am), because you are not playing a role, you are being yourself (again there is nothing wrong with this).<P>Acting and roleplaying are well basically the same thing, you just get paid to act hehe.<P>As for not putting in as much work.. hehe you should meet me sometime and check out some of my characters, i self taught myself an Irish accent to correctly play one of my Vampire live characters..<P>hehe as for playing the characters i have differently..<P>Denekar Siegefyre, a grumpy little bugger, who finds it hard to accept anyone who is of the 'dark' pursuasion (Ask Ashara, im sure she can comment on this).. he also tends to get into trouble a great deal, although he has this remarkable ability to not quite get killed everytime.. Layla Wyldefyre his sometime hunting partner although she complains loves the little adventures they have when one of his plans goes somewhat wrong.. i.e. lets try to kill this here giant captain (last night resulted in a mad chase around the Eastern Wastes, with a wizzie (no mana) and two paladins (no mana) running like crazy around the place.. (well she always has a laff about them anyways..). he is VERY loyal and will gladly die for any of his friends and will take great personal risk for them as well (this is in past to him being a paladin and part to his loyalty)..<P>Sigje, my wide eye'd little halfling warrior, loves this BIG WIDE WORLD thing.. and loves exploring it all (the sights are mostly old to ME, but to her everything is a wonder and she plays up to this a LOT), she is always the little mischivous (SP?) miss but is very polite in a group.. always stating things like.. (after using band aids on someone in the group) "my mommy always taught me to look after the men folk!, cos they cant look after themselves"..<P>OR " YAY! take that ya beastie, daddy always taught me to hit the soft bits!" after a crit well yuo get the general idea.. she is a fun lil miss to play.<P><BR>Findel, wise sage gnome mage, who is VERY annoyed cos he cant dance.. like his hero Nizzmo! this guy is a little overly sentimental over his pets.. well they almost dance and he admires that and always has a tear in his eye when a pet vanishes or gives it life for him...<P>Hehehe<P>Basically, how, what, who etc of the roleplaying world is as varied as the human imagination (i.e. pretty much unlimited).. no one can say yes or no to what you do/dont do.. <P>Roleplay or not. everything is fine by me  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> and pretty much everyone else..<P>Some guilds WONT let you in unless you roleplay.. and yes their officers have THEIR idea of what roleplaying is.. theres a major world wide Vampire Live Society.. i flatly refuse to play in their games as they 85% of the time TELL you what you can and cant do to advance your character (i.e. using exp to buy such and such ability.. or discipline).. <P>the one simple thing to do to roleplay is this..<P>you play the game BUT to roleplay you need to do things your race/class/character would do REGARDLESS of what YOU would do.<P>And as it happens the NATIONAL roleplay championships are comming up in the next couple of months.. (&lt;&lt;-- winner of the AD+D catagory in 1997, havent been since  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> playing a female gnome thief  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ) and so people on 7th Hammer are going to see much more RP'ing done from me as i start to prep myself for the competition..<P>Anyways..<P>Been a good discussion, i like a good one like this.. gets my mind working a little  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>Titan, <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The spelling error in the title reminded me on how we used to call pen and paper RPGs that had too many die rolls and table "roll-playing games" instead of "role-playing games".<P>And EQ most definitely is one of these roll-playing games in which the game mechanics don't reward you for playing a role. Dwarven paladins are in groups with dark elf necromancers and troll shadowknight. Good aligned races kill NPC dwarves in Butcherblock for experience. Druids fear-kite animals. Doing something "evil" with your evil race character will get you banned as fast as with a good race character.<P>The only roleplaying thing in the game mechanics are factions, and those are often not that important. You don't get more or less experience points from killing a NPC of an opposing group. So, if you want to roleplay, go ahead, but don't expect any reward from the game or much support from the other players in the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
