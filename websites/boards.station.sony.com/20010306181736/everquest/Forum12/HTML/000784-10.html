</FONT><HR>Yeah probably not a bad one for him to add to the list, although they always dismiss it off hand.  I think its one of the basic rules of EQ that magic damage isn't reported (kinda like how you get weaker as you go up levels and how goblins are meaner than orcs).

</FONT><HR>HOW MY WIZARD WANTS TO BE WANTED FOR GROUPS:<P>Be the damage dealer and be wanted for dealing damage.<P>This does not work however when tank classes make remarkably more damage over time, rogues can do more even in short term. If a melee class can do 4-6 times more than a wizard on a longer period of times, no one in their right mind wants a wizard. We have to be in the same ballpark with the rogue to be a viable choice.<P>If you are not going to change the role of the wizard, you have to increase damage output to a respectable level. This requires radical changes to mana regen/efficiency, spell damage and mob resists!<P>I personally think wizards resulting in better soloers is LESS of a problem than being too weak to be accepted in groups. Wizards solo a lot now, but perhaps not just because they are good at it on higher levels, probably rather because they can spend hours LFG and quite frankly, most of us are tired of being laughed at.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Group Friendly Buff Idea...again<P>One spell line I suggested many months ago was a sort of targetable buff proc line using Fire Ice and Magic. As Wizards level they would get stronger buff procs that they could cast on tanks that would give them a Proc on their Primary Weapon. Wizards could choose which line to use depending on the mob's weakness eg. Fire, Cold etc. I think since Verant's Vision now is pure melee this would fit perfectly and we could be serving a PURPOSE in a group even when we are OOM like we are 75% of the time as it is now. <P>What do you think?  Hmm How about this one...<P>How about a skill or discipline that would allow a wizard to apply ANY spell from his/her spell book to a targets primary weapon.  For instance maybe being able to apply Ice comet to a warriors blade, that could in turn act as a proc effect or clicker.  This would not have a very long duration, but it would be a FUN spell that would help wizards get groups, and the wizard would be contributing even as he is sitting medding.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"The post 34 alleged reduction in resistances Wizards are supposed to have innately was not mentioned. This does not appear to have notable if ANY effect in the game, and if it is supposed to be there could bear some examination. <P>Never heard of this. I don’t even remember it being mentioned in the threads, or ever in all of my time with EverQuest, as a player or tester or employee. Are you sure this isn’t one of those famous EQ myths? I’ll add it to the list. I at least want to find out about it.<P>You want proof, eh?  Here's your proof:<P>From the Everquest Gameplay Forums on 1/15/00:<P>Oh, by the way, we are considering making spells cast by wizards inherently less resistable. We're actually testing something on test now, but I can't comment further until Tuesday evening. <P>-Gordon<P>From the Everquest Patch Message on 1/20/00:<P>Wizard Enhancement<P>Level 35 or above wizards will find that their spells (Magic, Cold, or Fire) much less likely to be resisted.  This effect stacks with the Staff of Temperate Flux and Enchanter, Shaman, and Magician resistance debuffs.  This change was made to increase the effectiveness of wizards at about the level that all spell-casting classes start seeing their resistance rates go up.  Wizards specialize in direct magical damage. It makes sense that they should be better at causing that damage than the other classes.<P>From Casters Realm's talk with GZ on the Wizard Tweak on 1/20/00:<P>The changes to Wizards mean that for any Wizard above Level 35 they get a lower chance of their Cold, Fire, or Magic spells being resisted. In reality their spells are basically given a built in "debuff" factor. This stacks with any other debuff, such as Tashania, Malosi or Temperate Flux and gives Wizards much better combat effectiveness. It is not a duration debuff. It does not mean when you cast a DD spell the mobs resistance is lowered for other casters in the group. <BR>What the tweak does is when a DD spell is cast it looks at the current resistance of the target, and then the new tweak reduces that resistance amount further, then uses that new reduced resistance within the game formula to determine if the spell lands, or is partially or fully resisted. This process is done each and every time you cast a spell which is enchanced by the new code. <P>Wizards should now notice the following with these types of spells now:<P>Green Mobs:  Rarely Resited <BR>Blue Mobs:  Rarely Resited <BR>White Mobs: Much Lower Resistance <BR>Yellow Mobs:  Much Lower Resistance <BR>Light Reds:  You will now have a much better chance against these mobs. <BR>Deep Reds:  Regular Resistance, with a slight chance of the "debuff factor" assisting. <BR>This tweak for Wizards doesn't change the 6 level cap.  It simply makes general combat much easier for the Wizard Class.  They should be able to use more powerful spells with less resists on mobs that would be resisted by most other members of the party.  It should help to keep the Wizard the true masters of direct damage spells.<P>From the Everquest Gameplay Forums on 1/21/00:<P>I didn't really read the other classes so much, but the wizard changes? Pathetic! Slightly increased the AoE and stun area of effect and resistances after lvl 35.How do I survive until 35?<P>Group? Wizards were affected by resists past about 40th level worse than any of the other classes, as they are the only magic using class without an indirect method of causing damage, and no other combat-related skill besides causing damage. Below 35, the wizards are a very solid class. I hung out with a wizard off and on for nearly 20 levels when building my Necro, and he didn't have a problem. <P>-Gordon<P>I hope this helps.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First wizards are suppose to be the most powerful spell casters in dd. Meaning they have extreme channeling powers. SOOOO<P>I say if they are masters at channeling why not give them the power to channel there energy into another class.<P>For example:<P>A (tank) a (cleric) and a (wizard) are in a group<BR>the (tank) is getting spanked and the (cleric) is getting low on mana,they need to kill this last mob to be out of harm. but the (cleric) can only cast one more heal, lets say the heal will do 400hp. The (tank) has 1500hp. The (wizard) with his powers to channel, channels his power into the (cleric) and now when the (cleric) casts that heal it does double the effect. healing for 800hp.<P>This would SOOOOOO improve the wizards group effectiveness. Could double any spell or just be restricted to healing or other spells.<P>This could so easily help out a group in trouble. Double a heal, double the time a stun lasts, double the effect of a buff, but could make it so it reduces the buffs duration to level it out.<BR>Like if an hp buff was casted, you could have it have a shorten'd duration and have it only give some improvement, like instead of giving 200 hp, 15ac duration 1 hour,  be:  300hp 25ac duration 25 min.<BR>Have the channel effect like a 8 second duration so they can't cast more than one spell.<P><BR>Absor said to come up with group spell idea's so here is one, It may be hard to do because you would have to choose which spells that would be effected by the channel power and stuff but it would be a great help with groups. i posted this on the other wizard forum, but got no response<BR>How about some input absor.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt; These dungeon evactuation spells would solve the wizards #1 problem. Getting a group.<P>In your standard Kunark or Velious scenario, where the group or groups have killed their way to a spot and "set up camp", evacs are out of the question.  It is actually more efficient to camp a Cleric and pick up the pieces when the dust settles.  The only "evac" type spell I can envision as being useful would be something that makes the whole group totally invisible and totally non-agro to everything for 40 seconds, allowing them to safely camp out.<P>&gt; Upgrade Sunstrike to 2400ish damage for the same ammount of mana.<P>Not sufficient.  This would enable a L60 Wizard to match the damage output of an under-equipped L60 Warrior, perhaps one with a FBSS and some Ykeshas.  Remember the goal is for we, the Wizards, a one-trick class, to match the damage output of our one-trick melee counterparts, the Rogues.<P>And if Wizards are going to get a solution to their efficiency problem, Verant is pretty much going to HAVE to limit how far Wizards can take it.  Perhaps by putting the new efficient spells in the game with recast times that limit how quickly the Wizard can burn his mana with them.  Sunstrike doesn't have a recast time.<P>One last thing.  Cut it out with the group buffs, the group-related damage scaling, and the innate Wizard abilities that help the group.  All of you are simply wishing you were some other class, and who can blame you?  That's what we're trying to fix!  Most of my Wizard friends are either quitting or in varying stages of Rogue twink development (whereas I don't have enough patience with EQ to play another class again), the latter of whom know what Wizards have lacked forever and are making up for it by playing the class that doesn't lack it.  I'm willing to give this balancing act a chance.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Group friendly ideas that don't steal from other classes:<P>A long time ago I posted an idea here about gravity type spells. The basic idea is to have an Area of Effect line of spells that would allow the wizard to 'gather' mobs together. You target one mob near the center of the crowd and all the other mobs in a certain radius will be 'summoned' to the target. All mobs will take a reasonable amount of damage as if they had fallen from a height.(since they are falling towards the target) It would have to have a small amount of hold time otherwise they would instantly aggro the wizard and the spell would be useless. As with all AE if the wizard is too close he gets caught in the damage as well, and I sure wouldn't want to be stuck in a crowd of 5 mobs I just nuked  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>These spells would be AMAZING in concert with enchanters/bards when controlling trains and overpulls. Since it is not crowd control in and of itself it doesn't steal anything from the enchanters, it simply aids them in their job. Many of their problems are in targetting as I understand it, well these spells would aid them in targetting as well as offer more use for their area of effect mez.<P>These would also be useful in experience groups using the AoE tactics. Or even just to get off an area snare to prevent runners. The hold time might be useful in keeping mobs off of healers or other wizards/druids that are trying to evac...<P>The code is already there, mob summons and force spell knockbacks would be examples...And the gravity theme is already a part of the class since we have gravity flux and invert gravity.<P>Other ideas regarding spells that AID other classes to do their jobs better are great!! By having spells that HELP others to do their jobs better you would be making the wizard class unique and more desireable in groups. You neither give wizards anything new (technically your just allowing us to enhance others) nor take anything away from anybody else. They would qualify as buffs I guess, but that is what the players find useful.<P>Other useful things have been mentioned too. Like the target tank AE aggro. It wouldn't even have to do damage...<BR>Maybe:<BR>War Cries of Solusek, cast time 2 seconds, mana 25-60, recast time of 1-5 minutes- target main tank and for 3 ticks he gives off a taunting aura of sorts. Anything within 10-20 feet of the targetted tank will move him up one knotch on their aggro lists for each tick. <P>Anyways, those are just a few random ideas I have seen around the boards or thought of myself in the last five minutes. Its not that hard to be creative when you look at what is useful to groups.<P>1) Damage<BR>2) Damage prevention<BR>3) Damage absorption<BR>4) Healing<BR>5) Crowd control<BR>6) Mana regen<BR>7) Utility such as emergency evac, rezz, etc...<P>I'm sure that is not comprehensive but its probably pretty close to it. Absor wants to believe that damage and evac's are enough to make wizards uselful but that just isn't the case.<P>Evac's are a joke anymore, toys used to help people get around in Kunark. May as well change them to regular ports because that is the only purpose they really serve after clerics get exp rez.<P>Damage- well yes, wizards should definately see many improvements in this area. However, I honestly do not believe that it will ever be enough for groups to find us useful. No matter what you do to efficiency and damage over time the fact remains wizards are not unique in their ability to do magical damage. Wizards will still forever be limited by their mana pool, once its gone we sit, even if mana regen is increased we just sit for slightly less time. The group percieves this as an experience THEFT and boots the wizard from all but raid groups. Also spell damage is not seen by the group as any kind of numeric value, and spell graphics span all caster classes. So who's to say if it was my nuke or the mages/enchanters/shamans/etc.... that just made the mobs HP drop a tiny tiny amount.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> <P>*******IMPORTANT*********<BR>Groups need to be made aware of our presence and be able to SEE us contributing in ways other than just damage. Damage is fairly indistinguishable as far as who's doing it when we're talking about spells. <P>The wizard class isn't a class if you think about it. Damage is not better than any other caster therefore wizards can't be called a class based merely on spell damage. Evac's are not unique and wizards are certainly NOT the best at it. Druid's are the evacer's of Norrath I'm sorry to say. With better locations, earlier spells levels, more AC and HP to survive, as well as a plethera of other group friendly abilities, wizards are LAST choice for evac'er. <BR>And since these are the only two things your basing the entire wizard class on, you basically do not really have a "Class" at all.<P>Sorry if this revelation strikes any nerves, but it is fundamentally correct and indisputable. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wow, just read that and BOY talk about a tangent  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<BR>Oh well, I think I made my point. Which basically was refuting Absor's post about not taking from other classes in order to improve wizards. I honestly don't think you can improve wizards without giving us something totally new and off the wall or by spanning the divide between the classes. Wizards are just way to narrow to be useful. The idea is sound but the implementation of making wizards pure damage dealers is a nightmare at best. It would require making wizards do such obscene amounts of damage that the game would be ruined.<P>It just can not be fixed by keeping wizards as damage and evac only. And that is my point and my opinion.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Basically improved gate.  <P>Would like to see the PoG robe with a usable effect. if you keep it the same nuke it has, drastically reduce the casting time.  Unbalancing? Jaundiced Bracer.  Prefer to put the Shield of the magi on the robe.  (And why is the necro robe given a 57th effect while Wiz has a 44th? Balance that too please.)<P>Draught line. Nice.  How about continue it?  Fire, magic, magic, cold is the current progression.  Suggest adding a fire that equals the cold one and place it at 59.<P>How about putting in a fire and magic based match for Solist's Ice Spear?<P>How about putting in a cold based match for sunstrike (call it Wrath of the Void)?  Fire based match for ice comet (call it Meteor Strike)?<P>How about putting in a group member targetted gate line that matches current wizard portals?  Such as translocate gates the target to their bind, these would gate the target to the appropriate portal.  Ease the burden of taxi service if we didnt have to zone everytime someone wanted a gate.  Which would encourage us to give gates more freely to those who ask.<P>Add a lure with a Jiva-esque effect.  Draught has 2 magic based ... jiva and voltaic.

</FONT><HR>I thought there were a HUGE number of posts originally regarding the non-'group friendliness' of wizards? As far as I can see, in Absor's summary the only cursory mention of this is the possibility of melee-proof NPC's... surely we can come up with something better than this? We want to be part of everyday group encounters, not some special one-off situations involving ghosts in the corner of a dungeon somewhere  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>I also don't see any mention of balancing out the component drops for research only spells, so that they can be obtained at the appropriate level. Sure, those of us in guilds can get the runes from higher-level guildmates if we're lucky, but what is the point of that? There is just no comparison between the page drops for enchanters, and runes for wizards... they are way out, both in mob levels that drop them, and in quantity.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Fyrestaff,<P>You missed my entire point. All the things you suggested would essentially fix nothing.<BR>We need to be visibly contributing to groups both in and out of combat. How that needs to occur I don't know, I just know that that is the ONLY fix.<P>More efficiency and better nukes wouldn't really solve anything for the class. Every class can nuke to some degree. Who cares if the wizard is 10, 20, or even 30 percent more efficient at it? Once he's OOM there is nothing else he can do to help and thus will be a burden. Lures are Raid only spells and can not be considered to be a balance factor, especially with their inefficient nature. A very small portion of wizards will ever even  see a raid, not alone go on them regularly.<P>The suggestions I put up were fairly random and meaningless. They were just there to give a starting footing for other ideas.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>After hearing about the 'Class Balancing' project, I held a small shred of hope that my main character, the one I had previously enjoyed playing so much, my Wizard, would once again become useful. After all the posts, replies, etc, it is fairly clear to me that the class, in my view, will never be rectified to the point that Wizards again become a viable Class. I for one am glad I have moved on to other more desirable/useful classes like Warrior, Cleric, and Rogue, and have all but retired my Wizard to his newfound Velious role, a Gate Bot. <P>Andraxx Skyefyre<BR>Mithaniel Marr<BR>&lt;&lt;AFTERLIFE&gt;&gt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Two ideas for group friendly spells that have been brought up before, just want to note them again:<P>1) Stun spell with no damage component.  This should not be out of line since we already have a series of stuns spells, so it won't add new abilities to the class.  Where this will help is when a mob has been pulled off the tanks, and we can assist with a stun without worrying about whether it is timed right so it doesn't break the mez spell that the enchanter/bard/necromancer just cast.<P>2. Group Harvest.  Been brought up before, might be too powerful to just add that much mana per person for each cast...  But how about this: Harvest has a fixed mana pool, something like 400+20 per level.  Then this mana is split up between all casters in the group.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Single Target Rain Based Nukes.  Similiar to a DoT, but the target has the option to move out of the radius.  This neccesitate group cooperation to keep the mob in one place.  <P>Upgrade to Eye of Zomm...Posees a similiar quality to rogue sneak, BUT...Cannot interact with environment, ie no corpse dragging, or opening doors.  It's merely a scouting tool used for gaining Knowledge.<P>What about a spell that gates a mob to it's spawn point, while wiping the aggro list?  Effectively removing the mob from combat, but no exp is gained.  This allows for a certain amount of crowd control in dire circumstances.  Also, a recast would have to be put on it, I suggest about 5 minutes.<P>just a few coppers, best of luck to the development team and teh testers.<P>Slyvarius<P>57 wiz Nameless<BR>51 enc Vazaelle</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Balance: <P>1. In the final analysis, Wizards want to be able to fight, not sit. We want to be considered as someone to shout for when forming a group, and someone who gets a few offers when we shout for group.<P>Damage output per second/minute/10mins/ 30mins/60mins needs to be compared to Rogues and other melee classes wielding the ever-improving weapon drops,  and made to roughly match. <P>This needs to be done without overpowering the solo-ability we have due to Snare. I personally would give up snare to have a MAJOR increase in damage over moderate and long periods of time.<P>It looks to me like Absor's list is trying to address this, so good deal.<P><BR>2. Make the Brain-Bite/Concussion spell more accessible to compensate for agro increase. It is not all that successful of a spell anyway, so don't think the Wizard is suddenly going to have no risk. <P>Again, this is on the list.<P><BR>DONT: mess with fades/yonders. We don't need any kind of group fade or blink.  This would end in disaster, with Wizzys being blamed when we yonder the group from one mob as we try to escape and into the arms of a gang of others or into a wall. <P>DONT: mess with Quad kiting since pretty much any Pet Class can kill 4 mobs already.  <P>I have posted "cut-n-pasted" eaxmples from the boards of these very people, the pet-classes, showing how they take on heavy rooms in Lower Guk and the like, getting some good loot by themselves, while we drag around a few blue mobs in a field for a 5 pp drop and a rusty long sword. Gimme a break. This is a non-issue and should be taken off the list.<P><BR>Group friendliness: If the Wizard can do a closer amount of damage to melee classes during mid-length and long battles, that would be friendly enough.  I might add:<P>1. AE Root<P>2. Make Translocate drop more.<P>3. Look at the hate-list system that is giving all the expeierince in planes groups to the melee groups. As it is, taunting classes get the experience off of mobs that caster groups did 70% damage on--this is a joke.<BR>(NOTE: This also happens in places like CoM and anywhere else multiple groups are used).<P>BTW, what is the point of making Translocate such a rare drop??  Is it that you don't want us in groups?  <P>I honestly can't see anywhere that VI wants Wizards to be in groups.  Evacs aren't really used--rez is used.  Teleports--we just taxi in the group then are disposed of. Snare is ok, but really, it is not that big of a deal--super-swords are taking down the final breaths of mobs so fast now that a little walk-off by the mob isn't really such a problem.<P>All the rest of the things are really bugs and wish list stuff, not Balance or Group-Friendliness isses.  I would personally scrap Absor's whole list just to have balanced nukes and AE root. <P>I must say that this view really only applies to the 50+ game.  Others posting here address the level 1-48 issues much better than I, and to be truthful, I always felt pretty useful and balanced till RoK and its 10 extra levels came along. <P>Then the game tilted downhill fast, then SoV came out, and then it flew downhill and crashed.  <P>The weird thing is, I am generally an optimist, and prior to 50 was always posting and struggling against people whining about wizards and suggesting we were broken.<P>Then when I hit 50, I woke up one day and found I had almost nothing to do.  Nothing... <P>Without a big guild to sort-of take you along as a pet wiz, you're damn near dead in the water at 50+.<P><BR>Quite honestly, if the expansions had never come out, I would probably still be happy as a clam.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wizards are all about damage and evacuates?<P>Well, I would like it if it was actually what I was supposed to do. I recently made it to level 30 and when at 29 I bought my first evac spell (North Karana) I thought that maybe I would have some more luck joining groups. Since then, everytime I join a group, I ask if they want me to be ready with an Evac. The answer is almost always no, unless I am in Infected Paw. Currently I'm in Cazic Thule and every time I am told that it would be better to die and then get the exp back than to run from North Karana to ger back to Cazic. Yes, at 30 I can ONLY port to Toxxulia, North Karana and Greater Faydark, so as an evacer I am totally useless, unless there is a druid that can port us to Feerot, but in that case the evacer job could as well be his. An evac is useless unless you can bring the group back or close to there, especially since clerics can revive and get the group back in working order in little time.<P>In general all of the druid ports are better placed and obtained earlier than the wizard ones. Since the wizard has to be an Evacer then give us the means to do it. (And not at level 60 please, there are low level wizards too.) I think that the idea I read earlier is GREAT: single dungeon evacs that you get at the level in which you are able to hunt in that dungeon. That would make us very group friendly, give us something unique and not steal anyone else role. Having a wizard in the group would mean something then, and not just seeing sparkles of different colors on the mob suggesting that MAYBE it has been hurt.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Buff, Mez, Stun, Haste, Clarity, etc, stc.<BR>Bard #2 choice, Limited to a smaller number of beast to control at one time, typically requires a bard that really really knows what he or she is doing, and a group of well seasoned player to be effective.<P>EVAC/SNARE/STUN DEPARTMENT:<BR>WIZARD or DRUID depending on who is LFG at the time.<BR>Wizard - Typically if a Cleric and Shaman are in the group already.<BR>Druid - If the secondary Healer role is not filled.<P>SECONDARY HEALER/HYBRID:<BR>Depending on who is LFG at the time, you put BARD, SHAMAN, RANGER, PALADIN in this slot, BARD if you want casters to med faster, Ranger, Paladin for more melee power, Shaman for more Healing power. If you have a choice at the time you are forming a group it is always best to add where you percieve the weakness, best choice will depend on who is filling the next role most likely. <P>PET CLASS/PRIMARY DAMAGE DEALERS:<BR>MAGE, NECRO, MONK, ROUGE - Mostly dependant on who is LFG at the time.<BR>Rogue - if you need to unlock doors, or you need to have someone sneak somewhere.<BR>Monk - if you think FD pulling maybe needed<BR>Necro - if you are need to add support for CROWD CONTROL.<BR>Mage - CoH is nice for getting people to your camp if someone has to leave, without alot of downtime resulting.<P>----<P>Which experience group would you rather be in while camping Sebilis?<P>Group 1 -<BR>54 Warrior<BR>60 Wizard<BR>60 Wizard<BR>56 Cleric<BR>54 Druid<BR>53 Enchanter<P>Group 1: If they used PB AE spells would be fun but, likely they wont know how and/or would suffer from Downtime or a death and likely split up, and try to get into a more "balanced group".<P>Group 2 -<P>54 Warrior<BR>53 Mage<BR>53 Necro<BR>56 Cleric<BR>53 Enchanter<BR>60 Wizard/Druid<P>Group 2: Has a Warrior, a Mage Pet, and a Necro pet to tank. The clerics main concern is going to be healing the Warrior, Enchanter. Necro can give mana to the Enchanter or the Cleric if needed. While the Mage and Necro can add just as much Damage to the mobs. Wizards role in this group is mainly Snare/Stun, Nuke when you can but it doesnt matter and Evac before or after we split loot at the end of the night.<P>Most wizards really are not going to be happy doing just this, over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again like the game EverQuest is played. Not to mention it take hours normally to get into these "balanced groups", typically not because any zone you want to hunt in is short on Wizards and Druids, its normally becuase there isnt enough Enchanters, Warriors, or Clerics around to start a group, only exception to this is when there is NOBODY else in the zone, like The Hole for example, at least on the Nameless, if you turn on LFG in the Hole, you are likely going to be the only soul in the zone for along time.<P>----<BR> <BR>Once you are sick of doing nothing but Snare/Stun and Evac in a group, you are going to try to solo.<P>You decide to solo something determining to yourself while you are sitting on your butt doing nothing for 13 minutes between pulls you realize that though you can do it, you are at the very bottom of the list of classes that can solo well, but you have the ability to Quad kite, though Terrain and the type of spawn, and the mobs Total Hitpoints are all very limiting factors if you will enjoy the time it takes to do it correctly, still resulting in 13 minutes of do nothing and sit on your butt time.<P>Tired of doing this and frustrated that your experience bar is not moving forward you will likely go back to a zone and sit there for hours doing more nothing, until you can get a group which only needs you for SNARE/STUN/EVAC and could care less if you nuked for full damage or got resisted for full as long as it looked like you tried, they already know that you suck in the damage department, which is why they only want you for SNARE/STUN/EVAC. Nuke when you can every little bit helps right.<P>SORRY!!!!!!!, but most people DON'T decide to play a wizard for these reasons, I am one of them.<P>This problem isnt limited to just one level or one dungeon. Its obvious that we just dont do enough damage period. Though are damage at one time is sufficent, are Damage over Time is WAY FAR off base.<P>The problem just became much more obvious on mobs that take a hour and a half to kill, and you see a wizard doing what they do when they solo, which is sitting on there butts doing nothing.<P>The mentality that a little tweak to a few spells or a group of spells, really needs to stop. The spells themselves are not bad, even with the resists, fizzles, and long cast times.<P>Wizards where suppose to be the masters of magical DD, then when that wasnt technically true then it was Fast Damage, none of these titles ever really fit what the class or ever did, if so then title was held by a very thin line much before my time, and all the various twink weapons and armor, and upgrades to mobs since then.<P>Of all the in game items that a class can get, is there anything a wizard can actually get that would make them "more powerful", only things that would where demeed "over-powering" and uber nerfed to uselessness, or they are placed on mobs that only a handful of players will ever have access to much fewer would ever have a chance to own.<P>Balancing the class should not be done by adding armor that casts DD spells and the such, "Balancing" needs to be something that every wizard has a right to.<P>The best way to improve the wizard class, and "balance" them is to allow them to be the obvious best at something, which they are clearly not now of anything.<P>Wizards have there damage potential(Mana Regen rate)increased significantly.<P>2x level 20+<BR>3x level 40+<BR>4x level 60<P>If this means spells like Harvest, Clarity, or a Bard song no longer take hold on a wizard once these adjustments are made, then so be it.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

We can use up more mana per fight than before. Double mana regen = double the dmg.<BR>Its very simple math.<P>! Decrease our down-time. Thats all it does. In can not improve our soloing ability (in combat) or unbalance the way the game works since we are the only other class (apart from some healers) that are 100% reliant on mana.<P>! Does NOT give use the edge in a single fight.  Doubling mana regen will not aid a wizard in any way to drop Trak faster or more efficiently.<P>Now with this in mind, faster mana regen will NOT solve all the problems that arise when encountering extermly high HP mobs, but its one step closer to being a group-friendly class.<P>INCREASE OUR INATE ABILITY TO REGENERATE MANA<P>And we will be that much more able to aid the group. 2x is nice, 3x is great, 4x is unexpectedly (but not uundesirably) high.<P>2.5x natural mana regen rate for wizards would increase dmg output since it would let us keep the same down time. 2.5x more dmg for the same down time....<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Spell efficiency:<P>***Assuming the implementation of increased mana regen has taken place***<P>As it stands, wizards have a limited amount of dmg they can deal to a single mob. Tanks, necros and pet classes do not. Don't misunderstand my point here, I don't want to flame about other classes.<P>A wizard is just as good as his mana.<P>Thats very important to note. One of the reasons we have asked for better mana regen. But when that mana is emptied, we are done. With the advent of the potential for extrem HP of Velious mobs, wizards fall behind since they can not do the same percent of dmg to the mobs HP as they could with an "Old School" mob.<P>Two Solutions:<BR>! Percential Damage Spells.<BR>I have seen this thrown around and its a very sound idea. We could hit a mob with 32000 hp and do 3200 (assuming 10%) or a mob with 10HP and do 1 dmg. This here is an important point since wizards would NOT be able to revage a zone with these spells without the same mana drain per mob. These ould be an excellent solution since they do not unbalance, but allow s to catch up to the rest of the new world.<P>! More damage, less mana spells.<BR>Again, a viable solution for the new potential of mobs HP, but they could be considered unbalancing since a wizard could now to insane amounts of dmg to a mob with low HP, thus enalbing them to solo more so than now. 2 solutions to this:<BR>1. Restrict the spells to only Velious. Not too hard, its been done. No binding in the planes, no gatig in PoA, no DMF in Kedge. Just put these new spells in only velious and possibly in Howling Stones or Seb (possibly) and future zones that would require them.<BR>2. Let them be used anywhere. This, although has inherant problems with wizards being able to take a mob that they would not have been able to before, they do open new doors to lower level wizards if this hypothetical new line was added around 20.<P>These changes, along with the new mana regen, would allow the wizard to keep up with the new worlds that are discovered about every 6 months *hehe*<P>Illarian Wildfire</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor you asked for something to make wizards more group friendly...<P>Well my suggestion is to scale their mana pool acording to the number members in the group. This would give the wizard in the group more flexibility - most of the time a wizard will nuke at a rate equal to mana regen (which is fine - everything is running smoothly). When you get an over pull then a wizard will nuke more to kill things quickely - more mana will help the group survive in situ (without having to evac  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">)<P>Gilaean 45 Ranger<BR>Gilazap 35 Wizard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>IDEA FOR A GROUP FRIENDLY WIZARD SPELL:<P>- A whole line of spells could be given to the wizards that help in groups.  The spell would be Reflection.  At level 12, the wizards get their first Reflection spell - Minor Reflection.  When cast on someone, it takes and DDs (including damage sheilds) and reflects 5% back to the target.  For example, a desert madman casts a DD on a person for 100dmg.  The spell than reflects 5dmg back to the target.<P>The spell increases a little bit for ever 4 or 5 levels.  For example - lvl 12 reflects 5%, lvl 20 reflects 10%, lvl 29 reflects 15-20% (increases a % each level until 34), level 39 reflects 21-25%, level 44 gives a group version of the spell, and finally, level 50 reflects 25-35% (increasing one % per level until 60.<P>The spell line would not be too powerful.  At level 60, if a mob csat a 1000dmg dd, it would only reflect 350dmg back which a someone could normally do with 1 of their own DDs.<P>The downfall to the spell would be that it slightly decreases ac and only lasts through 4-5 DDs and only randomly occurs, and does not work under AE spells.  In other words, the spell will only work everyonce in a while.  It won't work under AE spells because a full group could reflect more than 1000dmg per AE spell cast which would be too powerful.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Heya Absor..<P>I'm sure the likelyhood of you ever reading this sucks, but here goes. You asked for a way we could be more group friendly. Obviously we need to do more damage but that has been covered. Here is my buff idea for wizards that makes sense and adds group and raid desirability: <P>The lvl 57 (58?) spell manasink. Make it a spell line, like the rune series, and of course make it a targetable spell. It makes sense that wizards would be able to protect others from magical damage. This would not only give wizards a unique buff, but it would also give them something to do during the buffing phase of an encounter, rather than sit there twiddling their thumbs at FM. Make the first one starting at say 44, with no regent. Manasink (costs a jasper) could be moved down to say 52-53, and a more powerful one (costing a peridot) could be introduced at 58-59. This will not solve the wizard's biggest complaint. But it is a step in the direction of being more group friendly, which is what this game is all about. <P>One other thing, that i'm suprised no one seems to mention on these threads. Its very minor, but would you please suggest that the duration of levitate is increased per level? Its pretty rediculus when a lvl 60 wizard still has to recast it every 10 minutes. It costs a regent to boot! Pretty please, let the duration increase per level (easy enough) or make an upgrade (not necessary).<P>Hope you get to read this<P>Twompy Everblaze<BR>58 Evoker<BR>Morrel-Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Rets<P>Yes I think you comparison of rogues has merit but I submit it is still the wrong comparison. Think of the basic caster class as a group(magician,necro,and wizard). The purest is the wizard.  Think of the melee class(warrior,rogue,paladin,ranger,monk,and sk) and the core around which all hybrids are built and you have the warrior. Think of the pure utility class group as the enchanter and cleric equal but different.  The other utility classes(shaman,druid, and bard), center around these basic two with abilities to add to both the melee side and caster side of balance and have abilities of the two main utilities.<P>The first problem in balance is that we have three casters and six melee. But necros and magicians have pets when usuable. So a reasonable five to six. The utilility classes can add caster damage most of the time so this is where game balance begins in my opionion.  Caster equal melee enhanced equally on both sides of that equation by utilities.<P>To me rogues are a melee damage side of the equation and ,okay comparable to wizards as a pure melee vs pure caster. But in the overall equation as I have it here, must be compared for overall balance to the warrior from the viewpoint of mana versus hps as the basic lifeblood of either side. How all 14 classes contribute to one side or the other of this equation determines the balance in the game.<P>Bear in mind that the six man group limitation inhibits the ability to achieve the basic game balance. Yet some combination of the basic three elements generally make a good group if game balance is in good shape. That is, one or more of melee/caster/utility makes the best group. Any choice for a six man group should be roughly equal to any other combination to have balance.<P>My main point is that this class work before balancing the basic game will serve no purpose other than to goof it up more.  (Rets-hehe)BALANCE THE GAME FIRST THEN LETS GET TO THE CLASSES ALWAYS KEEPING THE BASIC GAME BALANCE IN MIND WHEN SORTING OUT CLASS BALANCE.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

This is a -MAJOR- issue for the PvP server wizards who don't just sit at TPers and nuke people who gate in before they have control of their character.

</FONT><HR>Ok, trying to come up with another "diffrent" idea, instead of repeat what has been suggested by other people many many times already.<P>A problem wizards are complaining about is the fact that we cant compete with meelee damage. Either from a meelee class, or someones pet. The damage that is done through meelee fighting throws off the wizards balance.<P>The problem is that wizards have NO meelee ability. Other classes can either meelee or have pets to do it for them. So maybe wizards need to be able to do some meelee damage somehow, but not how you may think....<P>The flamming sword pet.<P>What is wrong with this thing? First, its level 59, and its a dropped spell. Wizards have never had any sort of pet before, so when and IF we actualy get this thing it certainly doesnt appear to be anything useful and seems to be a spell we shouldnt even get....<P>My suggestion is that this be a spell line, all through the levels. Wizards getting the first and weakest one at level 4, and continue to get a better version at every level up to 49, then another one around 53 and then the final one(current pet) at level 59.<P>This is not really a pet as we all know, so this would NOT make us a pet class. We have no control over these pets, and they die immediately. These pets are a "meelee based DOT".<P>If wizards had this sort of pet all through the levels... then wizards would be able to inflict meelee based damage. *NO RESISTANCE!!!!*<P>This could also be a solution to the uber mob problem. Only if the pet is reworked a bit. I would love to cast the spell and have my pet beat on the uber mob throughout the fight, but there are some major problems that need to be fixed first.<P>The first time the mob uses and area effect ability, like Dragon Breath the pet will die.<P>The first time the mob reposts the pet will die.<P>These two problems would need to be fixed. I suggest making the sword pets immune to repost and spells. A regular meelee attack would still kill the pet, if the pet were to agro the mob enough to actualy get hit.<BR>--------------------------------------------------<P>Summary.<BR>Wizards get more sword pet spells, starting at level 4.<BR>Pet still has 1 HP.<BR>Pet can not be controlled, it immediately attacks the wizards target when the spell is cast.<BR>Pet is immune to repost.<BR>Pet is immune to area effect spells.<BR>The pet will die if hit by a regular meelee attack.<BR>The spells would not use a reagent, because we would be casting it so often.<BR>The spels would NOT cost a ton of mana. Remember that we would need to be able to cast it on every mob in addition to some DD spells.<P>Again, this does NOT make us a pet class.<P>This line of spells would simply give us the ability to inflict meelee type damage. Wizards are the only Damage based class who cannot do meelee damage.<P>Synra CrimsonScale<BR>53 Channeler<BR>xev<P>(I really need to fix my chat handle, lol)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Going to try to keep this one short and simple.<P>We have 3 types of spells.<P>Ice<BR>Fire<BR>Magic<P>I suggest this:<P>Ice spells would get a "slow" effect on them(because its freezing the mob). The slow on the wizards ice spells would be small, about 5% on all ice spells before Ice Commet. Ice Commet and all the higher level cold spells would have 10% slow. This WILL stack with all the shaman and enchanter slow spells, but not other Cold based slows.<P>Fire spells have a minimum damage. The minimum damage would be 1/2 the total damage the spell can do. For example, Drought of fire currently does 653 damage for me, so if the spell hits, it can not do less then 326 damage.<P>Magic spells would have a higher max damage, but could still do as little as 1 point of damage. Increase the max damage on all magic spells by 25%, that seems reasonable.<P>NOTE: Since these changes are to enhance the class, there should not be any change to mana cost, or any reagents involved on the spells.<P>At first it seems that all classes could get these changes. However, remember that wizards are supposed to be the masters of Cold, Fire and Magic DD spells, so we should be the only ones to get this change.<P>Synra CrimsonScale<BR>53 Channeler<BR>Xev</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 13 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;10&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-11.html">11</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-12.html">12</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-13.html">13</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000784&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000784&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
