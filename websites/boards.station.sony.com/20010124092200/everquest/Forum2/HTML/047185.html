</FONT><HR>About 3-4 months ago they announced a "purge of the guild database" claiming that guilds with under 10 members was to much trouble for them. So after giving warning for over a month they prceeded to delete any guild on any server that did not at the instant the particular GM did a /w &lt;guild&gt; have 10 members ON-LINE. So lots of them that were very active, and had dozens and hundreds of memebers got stripped of their guild.<P>We were then forced to go throught the arcane and silly NEW guild formation steps.

</FONT><HR>Airtreader, just give up.  You never, ever, ever have anything constructive to say, unless it's so deeply veiled behind your pessimism and hostility that I just haven't noticed it.<P>Several guilds were deleted when they shouldn't have been.  It was a big screw-up.  Granted.  But nowhere near 90% of guilds were purged, and you know it.  About 70-80% of the people I see on a daily basis in the game are guilded; that number did not seem to drop at all after the guild purge.  I don't even personally know anyone whose guild was disbanded, which would really be a stretch if the 90% you're claiming had actually happened.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Airtreader, that's crap. There were SOME guilds that were accidentally deleted, but it had nothing to do with GMs going around deleting guilds without people online. It was a DB purge, and mistakes were made. GMs were NOT doing /w and deleting guilds, it was automated. I know tons of guilds that had just over 10 members total, certainly never 10 online at the same time, that came through just fine. And it wasn't because it was "too much trouble for them" to have all the tiny guilds, it was that the guild DB was bloated and they had no more room on many servers for new guilds. Guild formation was halted on several for more than a month before the purge was done, for that exact reason.<P>I'm not saying that it wasn't a huge (occasionally horrible) inconvenience and that I agreed with the purging of small guilds instead of adding more DB space, but geez. Don't mislead people. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Airtreader, sorry, but you are the frickin troll. A guild should be a joining of people with a set goal in mind. Whether that be zone raids or idle chat. Yes, the guild needs to have above 10 members, but if they fall below that it's assainine to say they should be banned.

He said he did not have 10 people online, he didn't say how many people were mebers, try READING the post before launching ignorant flames in response.<P>They looked at the guild database not the /who.  If there were less than 10 active accounts (not 10 online) then it got deleted.  I know of several small guilds who while having more than 10 members total, don't EVER have more than 10 online at once.  They never had a problem.  <P>Don't forget there is also a deguilding bug.  It got damn near my entire guild once(and we had about 30 people at the time) cause they were all in the same zone for a meeting.

</FONT><HR>Humm D I will not repete your name since i find it offensive. However if you had been paying attention, really, paying attention you would see that your statement is false. Do a search for the title of a post called "bah!" (without the quotes, I felt i should say that since you don't seem like the brightest bulb) for one example. Also when someone published RL pictures of Gordon, i was one of the first to defend him from those that attacked based upon appearence. <P>As well, when a poster has attacked VI unjustly, I have defended them as well. But do I OWE them any slack? Not after 2 years. If they have a team that can't get the data right on the last 100 or so patches then they need to look at that team and quit blaming the players for finding the bugs.<P>Now when someone does attack VI or a GM on something am I one to come in the thread and call them liars and say they most likely were a thief or something? No that is for types like you and xelene. The last time she/he attacked me on that was for me requesting more info, yeah, that is really credible.<P>As to brew, my bad I read it wrong, glad to see you are so patient to wait for an apology, now you really ARE a jerk  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There's also a history with Airtreader.<P>BTW, all I could find that you said about snare/root is that you speculated that it might get resisted more.  You in no way predicted what happened.<P>Even if you had, no, it's not constructive.  Constructive criticism is pointing out flaws in such a way as to invite solutions.  It's best when viable solutions are presented along with the criticism.<P>What you consistently do is bring a great deal of hostility to bear against people who have done nothing worse than either work for a company that makes a game that you play or say something that you disagree with.  Whether or not you are correct in any way, shape, or form does not make what you said constructive.<P>I could say "Racism is very bad and harmful!  It should stop!"  That, most people would agree, is correct.  It is not, however, constructive.  Constructive would be "Racism is a problem we need to overcome.  We must continue to make efforts through the political process, education, and the mass media to positively portray minorities and interracial relations."  Just as an example.<P>Truth is, I hope, Airtreader, that you *are* very young.  Many teenagers go through periods of depression, isolation, and anxiety which can lead them to lash out in such hostility, but adults who get into this corner usually don't get out of it without some clinical intervention.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ahhhh.  Airtreader spreading more of his hostility and misinformation.  One server had a problem where way too many guilds were deleted.  One GM (a human being), screwed up.  Most guilds were back pretty dang quick after the error.<P>Airtreader:  When you are perfect, then maybe you can complain about others errors.

</FONT><HR>Airtreader wrote:<P>&gt;”About 3-4 months ago they announced a "purge of the guild database" claiming that guilds with under 10 members was to much trouble for them. So after giving warning for over a month they prceeded to delete any guild on any server that did not at the instant the particular GM did a /w &lt;guild&gt; have 10 members ON-LINE. So lots of them that were very active, and had dozens and hundreds of memebers got stripped of their guild.”&lt;<P>I don’t like to come in here just to refute exaggerations, but this is getting silly, Airtreader.<P>Your description of the guild deletion process is completely false, and obviously intended to anger our customers and probably our employees as well.<P>The truth of the matter is that on the day we do the guild deletions (which are scheduled to occur monthly), we simply pull the data from the server to gather the total number of guild members (not just those that are online) and remove those guilds that do not meet the minimum membership requirements.<P>We have most certainly made errors during the early stages of this process. But we have it down pretty nicely now.  And we have corrected the problems that happened early on.<P>Yes, it is still a requirement that all guilds have ten members – at all times.  We still intend to remove guilds that do not meet that requirement on a monthly basis.<P>&gt;”Ah, being a jerk eh? Well, ok, then 90% of them…”&lt;<P>That’s also a false statement, an exaggeration.<P>And, well, this thread seems to be more about attacking people than talking about game ideas.  If someone wants to start a new thread about the guild membership requirements, or even about our mistakes in that matter, please do.
