My necro for his first 23 levels the only magic item he had was a magical dagger so I could hit the monsters.  A trained chimp can play a necro.  You want to talk about power pre-50.  NECROS OWN US.<P>No I have not played a wizard, but my two best friends are high level wizards.  The biggest problem with the wizard class pre50 is they can't solo until they get their J-boots.  Once one of friends got his J-boot from levels 40 to 52 99.9% of it he soloed!  That is why I go berzerk when some wizard says they can't solo.<P>But as you can see the 60th level wizard sticks up for his class.  We mages pout because we got the royal shaft post 50, and than we are like male tigers.  Willing to eat our young.  Mages pre-50 let them eat cake.  As I said we are not NECROS(demi-Gods).<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Therefor, boom, useless.  <P>BTW, compare something of similar damage.<P>Compare our non-LOS DDs to your non-LOS DDs.  you win.<P>LOS DDs have always been powerful, but hard to use.

Whoever made that stupid comment needs to try it sometime.<P>I'm all for wizards getting a better damage output over the short term (how many times have I said that now?) but some of you are either lying through your teeth, or happy to remain ignorant in light of the facts.<P>Sorry Grimstaff, continue on.

</FONT><HR>Amethyr, all I can say is I watch his root and it lasts the same as mine and is resisted the same.  Seriously LOL I see no difference.  Now, it might be a different code (possibly) and I'm just amazingly unlucky, but I suspect you'll get a fairly supportive response from most people regarding root spells.<P>And Magicians got boned hard past level 50, that was a travesty that Verant seems totally unwilling to address.  Its simliar to the pathetic arrangement and types of summons Magicians get, Verant appears inflexible about them.<P>We can only hope they will start to listen.  Part of the problems we faced I think came down to one man: GZ.  I believe his pride was greatly influencing his decisions and willingness to even consider any dissenting view of his baby (casters).  Now that he's away we might actually see some changes.<P>And you could solo just like a Wizard if you had Jboots too, equipment doesn't determine a good solo class in my opinion, its what you start the game with and get on your own.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The 49th pet has a maximum level of 41 I believe.  So when I'm fighting things around my level, often slightly higher, the root is being cast by a 41st level creature.  The only time this will actually stick is if the creature is malised.<P>For example, dueling a 54th level warrior last night, the earth pet chased him for 3 and ahalf bubbles of health and managed to root him once in that whole time.  The root lasted around 2 seconds, about the same time as the stun from the pet's bash :)<P>I'll also point out that this is almost the only situation in which I would use the earth pet, the earth pet really is very inferior in almost every situation.  The air pet tanks far better due to its AC, it taunts a lot better as for some reason its stun is a super taunt, and both the other pets do significantly more damage than the earth pet.<P>I cringe when I see mages who are constantly using that pet :)  They have no idea what they're truly capable of!<P>(And yes I'm aware the earth pet is useful in some raid situations)<P>Believe me.  I know root is useless when you're under heavy attack.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Are you mages seriously saying you'll trade your pets for ports? Oh I see, just the other summons you don't need. Ok, I'll trade you the WK port for summon food and water. I'll even throw in one of the umpteen "adjacent to ec" ports.<P>As for root, let's be very clear about thing: root sucks for everybody. Lvls 16 to 29 suck for soloing with wizards because you need to reroot repeatedly. After 29, one nuke is almost guaranteed to break it. Why would we waste the extra mana to snare a single mob plus have to kite around if root works so darn well? At least the earth pet chain casts it. Us wizards are usually busy doing other stuff like nuking. <P>And if were jumped by a fast red mob, we hope yonder works in the terrain we're in or we're dead. Your pet can help you get away a heck of a lot reliably.<P>As for bolt spells, in dungeons enchanters always separate the mobs so bolt spells work just fine. I use them myself if its the best damage I have against a certain resistance. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ekeith I think you can always find a situation in which the mage is safer than the wizard, and vice versa.<P>For example, a pointless rebuttal to your 'attacked by a fast red' statement would be to point out how much my housemate laughed when I was killed by a green goblin 20 levels below me the other day - I was caught without a pet and he interupted every spell I tried to cast.<P>It's really not relevant because the situations are so different.  Most pets are pretty slow, you don't tend to travel with them.<P>I wouldn't trade any spells for any others.  I'm happy with the offensive focus of the class, it's why I chose it.  I don't want root, fear, yonder, shieldskins or anything like that.  If I did I'd play a necro, or a wizard, or an enchanter instead.<P>Actually I'm not sure why I'm posting this at all.  I originally posted because I wanted to preserve the perspective of the mages role, as some people were exaggerating the abilities of a mage by using the perfect situation in which they excell.  It's not a good way to measure the class, it's like saying that wizards are fine because they're the only class that can nuke Gorenaire.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Never used root again since level 29.<BR>Yesterdays Mage who was grouped with me in Sebilis had really no problöem to hit the MOBs with his bolts... sorry to say that, but you are using them in a wrong way, if you ncounter problems. IN a fairly open area, like a hallway, a big rrom or somethin glike that, you shouldn't have ANY problems to get your bolts on your target. Why?<P>Easy: (Lol, a Wizard has to exaplin Mages how to use their spells, hehe)<P>Groups consists of you, a cleric, a chanter.<BR>This leaves room for three more members, make it a rogue and two tanks.<P>The cleric and the CHanter would do anything to avoid to get into melee range to the MOBs. Therefore they will sit in some distance from the action. They SIT.<BR>The rogue will attempt to backstab as often as possible, so he will be behind the MOB, and teh tanks most prolly attack the MOB from the Frontside.<P>That leaves every good Mage the possibility to target the MObs side. THe Mage yesterday had some stuff, blastiung mana free bolts, i have forgotten the name tho. He askesd us to hold our positions of possible, so he can get a free view to the MOB.<P>You Mages are NOT supposed to do almost as much damage as we do. And we arenät supposed to be superior in doing damage over time, like you are. EVen if you have to use your bolt spells a little carefull, think about what we have to deal with. We can solo, yes, i never denied that. But it is really hard as a Wizard and you have to be experienced and skilled to do that.<P>This i can expect from the Mages as well, if they have to use their bolt spells... btw i would love to have some of them... i like the casting range.<BR>So please, don't sell yourselves under price. Sooner or later us Wizards will do more damage, and this significally, than Mages, so learn to use that Bolts spells, but don't argue, they are hard to use.<P>Mages are NOT the Premium Nuking Class in Norrath.<BR>This are Wizards. But doing LESS damage than you (level 34) or almost the same (Level44) is NOT working. And i am pretty sure that VI will change that. You are doing too much damage compared to us, in the SHORT RUN, if you just wanted to do. (Again, the 15 points we are ahead of you are so easilz eaten by your Pet and the DS).<P>Accept this. This are facts. If you don't know how to use your bolts, i could get you in contact with some marvelous Mages, who are able to use their Bolts in 95% of all dungeon situations.<P>Natan Magus<P>60 Sorcecer<BR>Mith Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt;Even THEORETICALLY there should be NO CLASS that can outnuke a Wizard (Not with a Bolt nor with a DD).<P>Agreed.<P>&gt;And Mages are capable of doing it. It does NOT count if you have problems because you have to have a free view to the target or not.<P>Hmm.. I contest this.  They are capable of doing it here and there, not commonly.  There are situations (such as rains, AOE combat, and high resist creatures) where the wizard will completely eclipse any class.<P>&gt;You can do it, *and this quite often in very common situations*. (Even if you would be able to do it only in 10% of all situations, this shouldn't be.)<P>Agreed, except for the bit in *'s.<P>Wizards need to be able to 'burn' more effectively, in my opinion.  They are good at this in specific situations (see dragons and the like), but not so much in your everyday encounters (KC, Sebilis etc).  I don't think there's a whole lot wrong with the mage class other than the summons lines, and their broken spells which have been discussed to death in the mage threads.<P>In closing I don't see this thread as a mage vs wizard thread.  I saw this as a wizards need to be able to put more damage out when they 'burn', and originally interjected to clarify a couple of misconceptions about the magician class.  These misconceptions, when used to support an otherwise valid argument, undermine the argument.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Okay, give me more nuking power. And that'll only piss the wizards off. So where does it end?  Let's try something new to the mage class?  Maybe just give mages a spell that they can cast on a mob that will help the current pets out.  Maybe an AC/STR/AGI debuff.  It wont make pets stronger.  It'll just make the mob weaker so the pet is only stronger to the mob that was debuffed. Everyone happy? <P>  I've not looked at the ENC and the SHA's debuff spells all that much.

Root sucks.   and we get beat on and can't cast so our defensive spells are not all the effective.   sorry man  but root is effective.    Snare and root is even more effective.    pet root doens't do jack cuz it wears off 2 seconds later and if we have no pet we have no  shadowstep,snare, stun, shield spells, succur.   you name it we don't got it.   our pets are there for a reason.   we don't get anything else.   as for nukes.    keep in mind by 49 we got it comming to us and yes there is a  hold time on the lava bolt.   as for our nukes being equal?   um no you get one every spell circle as far as i can tell and we get one every 10 levels.    not even close to comparison.    yes 175 is strong at level 25 but when you get to level 33 and you are using the same damn nuke on mobs that have 10X the hit points this doens't really fly.   wizards that i know of passed my mage up a long time ago and are already 60 cuz they are so capable.   get another two levels and welcome to your true power while the mage continues to sink into the background as a pet class with a pet that misses have the time and powerful nukes that hit for 450.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

But you make a good point, in a group the pet adds to your offense which is already almost as good (or better at some lvls) as a wiz. btw damage shield counts as offense too. Irresistible at that.<P>Seriously, if you think snare + root is better than a pet why are you a mage and not a wizard?<P>And you shouldn't compare druid snare to wiz snare. Ours is aoe, i.e. snare self if in melee range.<P>Why is it people who don't have root are such experts on its effectiveness?<P>As for bolts vs. dd, if I had a bolt that did 30+ more dmg than my best dd for almost the same mana, you bet your arse I'd be using the bolt.

</FONT><HR>First off, someone stated that mages don't get credit for there damage as if that was a bad thing.<P>Credit for damage = taunt.<P>Mages have dmg shields and pets that don't put them at risk of dieing.. thats good not bad.<P>A wizard will Never do faster dmg then a mage if mage has pet out... not how the spells and pet rules are in game now.<P>A wizards sole job is to do dmg fast. <P>I would trade every port my wizard has for your lvl 49 fire pet.<P>Wizards Have nothing to add to a group in a fight other then nukes. The point of the nukes is to do dmg fast.<P>Why do mages do faster dmg then a wizard?<P><BR>   -Incorect-<P>   PS, anymage who can't use LOS spells in almost any situation just sucks, i have a 52 mage friend who never ever has a problem with them.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
