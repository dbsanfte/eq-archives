</FONT><HR>How you guys couldnt see anything wrong with the pet powere diff between a class (SK) that doesnt really need a pet or even should have a pet, and a shaman that could use the powere of the pet moreso then the SK and call it unbalancing if the shaman pet was upped in lvl to hit mobs and also less mana cost, you guys need to think about anychange to a particular class will affect all the classes not just one or two of them.<P>Also i think that shamans had been requesting a different type of pet nothing big just a bear, they got no responce on this issue to my understanding. We then find out you took their idea and gave it too druids, what a slap in the face. <P>P.S. dpmt even get me started on teh Hybrid XP thing, IMO you guys should have just changed it and denied it if people ever found out about it which i dont think that they would care. but this is subject for another post  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor..<P>There seems to be two very strong issues with the pets, one being the mana cost and the other being the lack of the pet hitting the target.<P>I don't think any shaman expects to have a tank or magician/necro equivalent.  However, the lvl 49 and 55 pets still do not seem to hit higher lvl targets.  While it would be nice to have a pet that cons blue at 55 (simply to be able to tell if you conjured a good one).  I think we would simply be happy if you fixed those two problems.  850 mana is extreme when you take buffing into consideration, and the lack of hits is pretty depressing.  I can slow a mob and root it while my pet plays with it, and it seems to get hit far more then it dishes out.  Considering I used Turgur's and Alacrity, that's pretty surprising.<P>Isn't there a way to increase it's lvl yet leave the damage output the same, so that it can at least hit the target?<P>Maddy</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Bane of Nife at 56! it is less efficient than ebolt.<P>Pox of Bertoxx at 58! again too little too late, the spell needs to do more dmg.<P>We need/deserve a NEW/more dots and we deserve them earlier then 56 Absor. <P>Thank you for your time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt; But keep in mind that we didn't try to make a large improvement to this pet either. <P>Yes, we got that impression already. You definitely hit that nail right on the head. Problem is, you MUST make a large improvement because that would be the only significant thing left to do with the pet. We can manage small, imperceptible improvement all on our own with the stats buffs.<P>&gt;I'll bring it up again, and we'll evaluate the current pet power. But it's not intended to be a tank for the shaman, nor is it supposed to be very powerful.<P>Here is what I expect from my pet. In a solo situation, against low blues, he is to keep the stuff away from my long enough for high-aggro spell (that would be about all of them… heh) to land, then, if I choose to tank instead of root'n stew, to add a decent amount of damage of his own while I bear the blunt of the assault. In a group situation, against high blues to red, I NEED it to do its share of damage so to be able to taunt off a aggro'd MOB from me so I can de-buff it.<P>I don't want a tank that I will send out to collect experience for me. I don't want a pet able to solo wurms. I don't even want a pet that can take a serious beating. I want what was promised to me, a companion able to protect me long enough for me to protect it, protect myself and protect my group.<P>&gt; One of the main concerns about this pet was that you all thought it wasn't hitting enough in combat. That should have been improved somewhat by the increase in level. Have you noticed this?<P>Absor, we're talking about a level *55* spell. Cast by level 55 and higher shamans. The pet is low blue to NPC that are low blue to *caster*. With a boost from level 38 to 39, the only thing the pet is going to hit slightly better are the green trash in the places we HAVE to go for experience and spell drops.<P>If you want the pet to do its job, you need to modify more than the average level and the dodge skill. You need to boost the ATK, the AC, the HP and the level enough so that it can get the attention of a level 52+ MOB and hold it long enough for the shaman to do his job. You may have to consider giving it triple attack or a form of dual wield, if only for taunt purposes. Seem like big things, huge improvement? Well, they are but don't kid yourself. Even with all those, it will still be a kitten compared to the *Shadowknights* pet.<P>&gt; While this sort of comment may seem clever, it really does very little to add to the conversation. All I ask is that you be honest with me about what you see in the game, and I'll be honest with you in response. Attacking us like this really isn't useful to anyone.<P>You're missing the point. He is not trying to be clever... he is pissed off. And he wasn't attacking you; he was attacking whoever was responsible of the last 'fix' and sending it to the live servers without even the modicum of testing that will have allowed the bug to be caught. It may have been inappropriate, but so is the shabby treatment shaman's issues have received. We tried polite request, talking, raising issues calmly. We tried reasoning, debating, proving. And we're still are trying all those things. But don't be surprised that, after talking without response to the void for a while, some decide to shout at it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I thought of a diffrent tact. I will describe my fighting tatics at 49 vs now with a pet.<P>At 49 I would pull with malosi. I would keep regen on me and the usual buffs. Even the stat buffs on me and the pet since at the time they were thought to be effective.<P>After I pulled I would root it. Then I would slow the mob and dot the heck out of it. Me and the pet would tank. After I hit 60% health or when my poison dot wore off (No diease used btw) I would root and step back redoting. <P>I would then sit down and regain 1-2 bubbles health while my trusty pet tanked for a full dot. I would then having regained a good deal of health and the pet having done decent damage step back up and finish the mob.<P>Now at 58 with pet-lite.<BR>I pull with slow since the new one lasts longer. I then root and malosi and dot the mob. I then bracer off the root, I bracer and hit untill the dot wears off. I step back and dot and cast a heal and very quickly run back before my pet dies. I then continue to do the same untill the mob dies. <P>My unspeeded pet used to do about 25% damage. My current 55 pet does like 13% with celerity. The new pet buff is awefull since my fights last so long it drops during my rather long slow fights.<P>All I want is a pet that will do what it did at 25%. Now admittidly since i can't get my damage spell drops I am hindered a bit. But from what I read no one can so thats normal.<P>Balith 58 Shaman <BR>Currently making a cleric since I just give up.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Know I think?  I think it does not matter how much we argue constructively, nicely or in a polite manner.  I bet anyone here that the answer we will get from Verant on Shaman issues will be:<P>"Class is considered balanced.  Sorry no changes will be made."<P>Why?  Too much of our class has gone to others so you just cannot yank back our spells w/o causing more grief (good job there diluting classes Verant...hope whoever came up with that idea gets a pat on the back...).  2nd stats are near meanlingless in this game.  Have been since release.  To fix that now will create havouc among all the players.  So there goes a major chunk of our abilities again out the window.  Pets?  Okay why did we ever get one if the pet was intended only for looks?  Offensive power?  Not our DDs for they suck (I can live with that though).  DoTs?  Oh you mean those nice spells that Necros now have and the ones that drop once in a blue EQ moon?  Hmm cannot remember when I used a dot last when in a group.  Oh wait I have slow!  YES...oh no those critters in SoV have mega high MR...oops there goes that spell out the window.  <P>Well I am tired of fighting a losing battle.  The shaman class, while looks great on paper I am sure, has been so demolished it is not funny.  Well thanks for the fun while it lasted Verant but this shammy is now in retirement.  Now I hope to get my necro and monk past 50.  At least the monk has playability post 50 and the necro to a lesser extent.<P>52 Shaman (now retired)<BR>18 Necro <BR>27 monk<BR>30 Paladin (who gets parked at 50)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think the Shaman pet should atleast be equivalent to the Shadow Knight pet but probably shoudl be stronger.  Because we are not hybrids, we are casters, we wait much longer to get our pets than a Shadow Knight does.

DO NOT forget for consistency sake that we should have ATLEAST 2 pet upgrades from 49 thru 60.<P>Guys, Verant really do not have a clue as to what shaman are about, i suspect the good folks who actually made this great game are not even employed there any longer.<P>Do you think Absor or anyone else there have played a Shaman to the highest of lvls as we have?<P>Have they gone through the trenches and Earned the right to even tell me or anyone else how THIS and THAT should be with the Shaman Class?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Let me preface this by saying my shaman is only 45 right now, so I only have experience during the time when our pets are useful.  All my opinions about the L55 pet are based on what I've read in forums.<P>The main attributes of pets seem to be damage output and survivability.<P>- In terms of damage output, what reasonable to expect?  When I was level 39 I used to solo drolvargs in FV a lot.  My tactic was slow the drolvarg, have the pet attack, dot the drolvarg, move into melee.  Both I and the pet had a haste buff, and the dog had taunt turned off.  This allowed me to tank for the dog.  In a normal fight, the dot would do a little more than 1/3 of the damage to the mob, I'd do a little less than 1/3, and the pet would do about 1/3.  All this is from memory, I don't have exact logs to back it up.  Based on experiences like this during there 30s and 40s, I think most shamans expect the pet to dish out melee damage at about the same rate they can when fight experience giving mobs.  Is this the case right now?  From what I've heard other people say, it doesn't sound like it.<P>- As far as survivability goes, shamans in there 30s and 40s quickly learn, the dog isn't a tank.  If a mob is on it for more than a couple of rounds, it's going to die.  I adjusted my tactics so the dog is never expected to tank.  The first thing I do when summoning a dog is to turn taunt off.  In any combat situation I make sure either myself, or a real tank is there to be on the receiving end of the mob melee.  The problems comes in at high levels that pet level appears to be a variable in the mob aggro equation.  The mobs prefer to pick off the weaker targets first.  Since the pet HP increases don't keep up with the increases to mob melee, the pets die before mobs can even be taunted off of them.  A mob that dies in seconds clearly isn't worth 850 mana.<P>My solution to this would be to have mobs use the level of there master rather than the level of the pet when determining whether or not to aggro on the pet.  For example, a level 55 shaman summons a level 39 pet.  He's in a group with the 55 warrior.  The warrior and the pet start meleeing a mob. Where previously the mob might aggro on the pet because it's low blue to him, now it's less likely to because it considers the pet to be like a level 55 char (although it still attacks and defends like a 39 pet).<P>One additional good benefit of this is that it would make pets more usable in dungeons.  Right now, the biggest problem for me is that pets tend to aggro things thru walls because they are such low level.  There are definitely places where you can stand in dungeons and be perfectly safe.  Just by summoning the low blue/green pet you can cause a lethal train.  For example, my shaman 45 is grouped with a 45 monk working to kill Xalgoz in the church area of Kaesora.  It's pretty tough to do as a duo at 45, but we appear to be able to clear enough spawns to so that we can kill Xalgoz when he spawns.  We get all of the spawns broken that we need to, but I decide to summon a pet just to be sure that we can keep up with the spawn.  The monk is pulling to the safe area behind the church.  The ghosts run but the pathing is far enough away from the church that they can only aggro the roamers (which are all already dead).  Xalgoz's room starts respawning and the first pull is a ghost.  During the battle, Xalgoz and another skel pop.  The ghost runs, my dog follows with the monk - wham - instant train.  That's the last time I'll ever summon a pet at that camp.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, <P>Others and I have said it before but you seem to ignore it, so Ill say it again. PLEASE ANSWER THE QUESTIONS! <P>1)Justify why our mana cost is 850.<BR>2)Justify why our pet spell is 55 and not 54.<BR>3)Justify why we didnt get a 2nd post 50 upgrade<BR>4)Justify why the SK has a Significantly better pet<P>Historically speaking our pets are as follows:<P>Lvl 34 pet mana cost 350<BR>Lvl 39 pet mana cost 400<BR>Lvl 44 pet mana cost 450<BR>Lvl 49 pet mana cost 500<BR>Lvl 55 pet mana cost 850/NOTE increase 350 mana rather then 50.<P>The one thing I want to talk about and I would Love to hear you give an explanation for is the for the huge departure of manacost pre 50 and post 50 and why the level of the pet was put back one compared to previous levels. Following previous levels, we should get this pet for 550 mana and at level 54. Not to mention we should get a second pet if the historical norm had been followed.<P>So once again this begs the question of why? All I want is an explanation. I want to hear the rationale you used to justify by upping the level to 55 and and upping the mana cost to 850. <P>Now, if you actually increased the shaman pets to something similar to the upgrade the Sks got I dont think you would hear any of us complaining<BR>about mana cost. Which again, begs the question. Why is a hybrid melee such as an SK have a SIGNIFICANTLY better pet than the shaman. Now im not asking for a nerf of the sk im just asking you explain to us the logic of all this....Is that to much toask?<P>Finally, if shaman pets truly are "companions" as <BR>was said by the previous host then doesnt that imply by the very definition that they arent combat pets? If you accept that premise or definition, wouldnt common sense dictate that you cant justify the 850 mana cost. <P>Patiently awaiting your reply,<P><BR>Thanks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt; Yes, it's a 55th level spell. But you also have to keep in mind all of the other things that a shaman can do. Pets are a secondary, perhaps tertiary, ability for your class. It's certainly not going to be as effective a spell as those in your primary area.<P>Why would anyone playing a shaman to level 50 and beyond consider our pet a *secondary*, much less a tertiary ability? We have to wait until level *34* to get it. It is THE coming-of-age step for the class, when we finally get the last and most significant of our spell line.<P>Just to make a point of this... Do you think that many players would be THAT upset about the freaking spell if it was a secondary ability?<P>Being able to Slam, regenerate naturally or both, those are secondary abilities. Invisibility (especially with the wonderful zone design in Kunark) is a secondary ability.. *Abolish Disease*, that wonderful spell I have cast twice in the last six month... now, that's the _definition_ of a tertiary ability. <P>Hold on to your socks, Absor… Buffing Strength, Agility, Dexterity, Stamina and, above all, Charisma. All those wonderful buffs with the mediocre results the TOP spells of those lines have on a player, THOSE are secondary, perhaps tertiary abilities. Never mind that whoever designed the spell list for the post 50 had an obvious obsession with BIG stats and decided that it would be THOSE would be the spells the vendors would sell, instead of our much more essential pets, DOTs and debuffs.<P>The pet I cast every single time I play is quite a primary ability, thank you very much.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

This is aswell not fair i say...<P>I remember at old giants in RM that i could use my lev 34 pet with kiting, and it took some time like 10 min too kill, but try kite the giants in velius at entrance too kael now, takes much longer time even with a lev 55 pet spell... <P>Anyway do something too the pet, so we atleast feel like using it again, i dont use mine much at this time, but i wait for a upgrade with much interest...

</FONT><HR>I think shrinking the scale of the level range on the 55 pet is improvement enough.  Each pet you get is going to be somewhat useful in it's role, unlike at level 49 when the two lowest ones indicate it's time to resummon.  One more level raise wouldn't hurt, making it 38-40, and returning our pet damage to normal (51-55 hitters instead of 47-51).  Let me reiterate though, removing the dead weight pets from that range is a great move.<P>However, I'll continue to argue to the end about the mana cost.  There's no reason any shaman can see, and it's never really been explained besides saying that's what the dev team thinks is right.<P>One last thing:<P>DON'T NERF SHADOW KNIGHTS BECAUSE OF THIS.  That is not the answer.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Rule of thumb I heard in customer service, every customer you send away unsatisfied is ten customers you will never see.<P>EVERY post 50 shaman, EVERY SINGLE POST 50 SHAMAN, says that the pet is screwed. This is 100% unanimous agreement. If you gave ANY other class a 75% mana increase for a potental one level pet increase you would have so many flames that you'd think you had died and gone to Hell.<P>The shaman pet is a tetriary ability? No, Sow pony, AKA alchemy, is a tetriary ability. The pet is a useful addition to the shaman class. But the 55 pet is useless. <P>You have already farmed out all the shaman abilities, except alchemy and shrink, to other classes. Often these other classes do this farmed ability almost as well as or better than shamen.<P>Good customer service gets "Thank you"s.

</FONT><HR>(continued)<P>&gt; Yes, it's a 55th level spell. But you also have to keep in mind all of the other things that a shaman can do. Pets are a secondary, perhaps tertiary, ability for your class. It's certainly not going to be as effective a spell as those in your primary area.<P>Beyond the point that our pet is far from being a secondary ability, at least as  far as we are concerned, all the 'other things that a shaman can do' are indeed very present in our mind. <P>The four main areas that people always associated to shamans are as follow:<P>· Healing<BR>· Buffs<BR>· De-buffs<BR>· Damage over time<P>Any group post-55 depending on a Shaman for healing is a group in a precarious position at best. Our top healing spell is the level 53 Superior Healing. Since it comes to us at 53, it gets only minor helps from our nearly max'd alteration skills and specialization. It has a fizzle rate over 25% and barely gets any Mana cost reduction at all. Add to this mix MOBs with thousands of HP hitting for multiple hundreds of damage per rounds and you can see that the shamans healing abilities are inadequate at best.<P>Buffs... let's face it, the only buffs we shamans have that add anything to another players abilities fall in 2 categories. Useful support buffs like SOW, Levitation, Enduring Breath, Invisibility and some vision spells. Those are hardly unique to the shaman class in anyway though. And buffs useful to tanks: the Talisman line (first acquired at 34 too, same as our pets... secondary ability?), the AC buffs, the haste line. That's about it except for some minor side-effects of the stats buffs. And the good ones have limitations all of their own, too. The Talisman line, unlike the Skin/Hero lines, overwrites the robe casters Shielding spells. The AC buffs are weak at best. And our haste line is a minor subset of the much more powerful haste spells that the enchanter gets. When it comes down to it, yes, a shaman can buff a tank but, in the kind of group make-up the level 55+ games start requiring, his contribution will be minor in effect, at best. Impressive as hell, with a 67 point STR buff, but still minor.<P>De-buff was were we shinned... let's face it, nothing is cooler than to see a player casts a spell and have the MOB start attacking in slow motion. Or suddenly STOP resisting the DD spells that a damage caster was throwing at it, being hit for full damage every time instead. Of course, those are hardly spells that are specific to the shamans anymore, are they? Neither, since the expansions, is it rare to encounter a MOB that is either utterly magic resistant or, with Velious, specifically SLOW-resistant. Then down the river goes all our de-buffing abilities, first diluted among the other classes, then just plain made irrelevant by design.<P>And that left DOTs.  Shamans always had 3 lines of DOT spells: Poison, Disease... and pets. Yep, our pet is a DOT. Oh, it does have some side abilities that are useful, like a mildly effective taunt by example. But nothing really more significant than its ability to do damage to a MOB over time. Now, the Poison and Disease lines have been hit by all the DOT nerfs over the months, but they are still pretty effective. Nothing devastating or unique, though, especially with the top levels DOTs having been rendered practically inaccessible by the lack of drops. Or considering that using DOTs in a raid setting, with a couple dozen other players whapping on the target, quickly leads to a corpse *poofing* with its loot and a blacklisted caster. That left the pets... but again, not really, because our pet cannot do damage anymore to the MOBs that we encounter.<P>So, yes, we are acutely aware off all the things a shaman can do...as we get higher and higher in level, gathering more and more power, we can become inadequate at healing, minor at buffing, replaceable to irrelevant at de-buffing and useless at damaging over time. That's a rather paradoxical position for a class, don't you think?<P>That doesn't mean we don't like our class, though. And that's why we're getting slightly intense in trying to get things fixed about it. And since we would rather have this happen without taking away from other classes' abilities (because there is time when turnabout is NOT fair play), this is why we are pushing for you, Absor, to ADD to our pets, to ADD our class. This is not a balancing issue. This is not a class envy issue. This is just a long postponed, class FIXING issue, one of many for the shamans.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
