</FONT><HR>I think the point of the post is to explain that the people who benefit the most from the recent xp changes are non-hybrids, because hybrids won't be taking their xp anymore when they share a group.<P>That being said, it's important to consider that this change does not provide much of a benefit for hybrids (since hybrids by and large can't solo, and thus were always grouped and receiving "bonus" xp from their groupmates), and therefore should not be used in an argument that hybrids are now balanced with non-hybrids by virtue of the change.<P>From my perspective (as a level 60 Paladin), the change actually hurts me quite a bit, as I now lose almost twice as much xp when I die.  True, I can gain it back faster now, but I would really rather not lose my level after dying 5 times instead of 10.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sometimes the few must sacrifice (ie the level 55+ hybrid community) so the majority can benefit.  I understand the argument that high level hybrids are making but I also know that the collective good is advanced by these changes.  In a PvE game (I play on a blue server) anything that helps players as a whole is a welcome change in my book.  I also think it would be nice if they offered some "compensation" for those high level hybrids that were subjected to the penalty for the past two years.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

You can call it "fixing a mistake", but every change we make to gameplay to improve various facets of it could be called that.

It only served to speed up the levelling rate of those grouped with hybrids.<P>Is that the current rumor? Not really true.  Though it is true that hybrids got a portion from the group, they never got their penalty completely offset.  See this math:<P>Human Cleric has 1000xp.  Human Paladin has 1400xp.  Both are the same level.  They kill a mob with 100xp.  <P>Before:<P>Paladin gets 59xp.  Cleric gets 43xp.  <P>Now: <P>Paladin gets 71xp. Cleric gets 51 xp.<P>Not to mention, we at least no longer have the problem of certain classes getting refused entry in groups due to "sucking" experience.  So hybrids level faster by virtue of the fact that they can group more.<P>-Gordon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I don't know of anyone that thinks it was not an improvement.  That's a bold statement to make, but I believe it to be true.  Are you actually suggesting that the removal of the experience 'penalty' was NOT an improvement to the game?<P>&gt;"Just because you set things straight after two years, doesnt mean you can hold it against us when ballancing hybrids"&lt;<P>I am so completely baffled by your comment, that I'm not sure how to respond…<P>I think I did mention that we have to keep the recent changes to the experience gains of hybrids in mind when we think about balancing, and that is certainly the truth.  It was a major change in the game mechanic.  To forget that it ever happened would be foolish.  The fact that it only happened very recently, and we most certainly have not seen all of its effects is very, very important.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Your example works out fine in this situation, yes, but what happens when the hybrid is the highest level group member in a full group of level 51-60 people (quite common).  The Level 59 or 60 hybrid would receive the most exp still, thanks to the new 1.4 bonus modifier, however they would not be getting a significantly higher amount of total exp per kill.  The main person to benefit from this would be the Level 51 player.  In effect, this exp change seems to hasten the levelling rate of low level people with high level people.<P>For example, a friend of mine, Level 36 enchanter was grouped with several people in Karnor's Castle of all places, that were Level 49-52.  Previous to the exp changes, he would have received a miniscule amount of exp.  However after the patch he receives MUCH more exp.  <P>The level 52 players weren't levelling faster.. just the Level 36 player. <P>If they *were* levelling faster, it wasn't really noticable.<P>Personally, I have played 59 levels with the EXP penalty as it was since release, and while *I* never found it to be a huge handicap, even though I soloed from Level 51-55 before Verant nerfed my Deepwater Helm (grin)  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.  Since the patch, I have not noticed my levelling rate to have increased dramatically.  However, low-level people that I group with, are AMAZED at how much exp they receive now, as compared to before, considering that I am a Level 59 Hybrid.. before the patch people that grouped with me didn't get any exp :P  Now they at least get some.. but the hybrid still gets relatively the same.<P>Try the calculations of exp with a full group ranging from level 51-59.. with the L59 player being a hybrid, post patch and pre-patch.<P>I don't know how to do that hehe, but if you would like to take the time to do that then it might shed some light on the question or problem, if there is one.<P>Thanks,<BR>Rennol<BR>Tarew Marr<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Absor, your opening statement in the line by line analysis of SK's today was: "As a starting note, all of us, players and Verant staff, really need to keep in mind that we just recently made a huge improvement to all hybrids by removing the experience costs" - Absor.<P>A "huge improvement to all hybrids by removing the experience costs" is NOT a Game BALANCE issue.  Your holding the removal of the experience penalty against us, but the removal of that penalty in *no way* affects our PERFORMANCE in game.<P>Yes, removing the hideously onerous xp penalty was an improvement and greatly appreciated.  Kudos for finally doing it.<P>NO, it does *nothing* to help the hybrids *in game* fight.  It has no balancing component to it, unless you consider time played by the RL person vs the time played by another RL person in a different class.<P>PLEASE reject the "removal of xp penalty" as a mark against us when considering *game balance* improvements to hybrids.<P>Thanks you</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

It should never have been there in the first place. Im glad its finally gone <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> But, beld was referring to absors sk talk post. Absor says that we have to keep in mind the removal of the exp penalty when considering future changes to any of the hybrids as the penalty is already an improvement.<P>The penalty was unfair and unreasonable. The removal of it is an improvement, but it is moreso a bug fix. It was arbitrary and did not factor into any balance issues. Hybrids were not given more power to make up for the penalty and they should not have power taken away now that the penalty is gone. The exp penalty, or lackoff, should not even come up in the balancing issues of any class. Beld was upset that it came up in the balancing of hybrids, a very reasonable reaction.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I posted this in the ShadowKnight thread before I saw this thread, I think it fits in better here so I'm gonna cut-N-paste.<BR>==============================================<P>Absor,<BR>Please reconsider your statment regarding the experience penalty. This "huge improvement" benifits hybrids only to the extent that we won't be denied groups by greedy people who care more about their experience points than our companionship in a group. Yes it also helps when we solo but that almost never happens because hybrids can't even solo as well as clerics! I'd go as far as to say that, at higher levels, only Warriors and Rogues solo worse than hybrids (except maybe bards.) <P>Also consider that racial experience penalties are no longer shared with the group at all so this is a double-whammy for a lot of shadowknights.<P><BR>Think about this Absor: <BR>Isn't it more fair to say that the experience changes were made as part of the effort to BALANCE all of the classes?<P>With the penalty nullified, balance can be much less subjective than if balance was attempted while making warriors and rogues 10% less desireable than priests and making INT casters 10% better than priests and making hybrids 30% better than priests. Talk about hard to balance! It is a lot easier now without the penalty because balance is less subjective.<P>If you agree with what I have said then I hope you will not hold the experience change against hybrids when considering balance.<P><BR>-vbCoder<P>PS: This is your quote that I am talking about:<BR>&lt;&lt;As a starting note, all of us, players and Verant staff, really need to keep in mind that we just recently made a huge improvement to all hybrids by removing the experience costs. That must be kept in mind at all times when thinking about any further changes to hybrids.&gt;&gt;<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor and Abashi,<P>I've done some more thinking about this and I think I see the problem.<P>I think what we have here is a fundamental communications breakdown.  You, Verant, say the word "balance" and what you mean by that is the entire Everquest world and all the possible entities within that world and how they interact with each other.  When we, as Everquest Customers, say the word "balance" we usually mean our characters **effectiveness in battle**.<P>The removal of the hybrid XP penalty was, from a Verant standpoint, a balance issue.  The RL time needed to go from level 1 to 60 has been balanced between all classes.  They are now all equal.  That change was a Good Thing.<P>Please allow me to try to illustrate why the removal of the XP penalty should have *no bearing* on the current proposed balancing of the combat effectiveness of Hybrids.  For the following example assume a level 60 SK and a Velious Uber Mob.  Also assume that the example is given twice, once prior to the XP penalty removal, and once after it.<P>*WITH XP PENALTY*<P>Joe_SK vs. UberMob_00<BR>Combat starts<BR>UberMob_00 /owns Joe_SK in about 5 seconds<P>*WITHOUT XP PENALTY*<P>Joe_SK vs. UberMob_00<BR>Combat starts<BR>UberMob_00 /owns Joe_SK in about 5 seconds<P>Do you see?  There is no difference in the comabt effectiveness of Hybrids by the exclusion of the xp penalty.  Yes it was a needed change, but when you talk about balance let's be perfectly clear.  We, as hybrids, are *NOT* currently balanced in effectiveness *in combat*.  Btw, it didn't use to be that way.  Kunark was what imbalanced us, and Velious has only exacerbated the situation.<P>Please evaluate Hybrids in terms of *Combat Effectiveness*.<P><BR>Many thanks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

That must be kept in mind at all times when thinking about any further changes to hybrids."<P>I was afraid this one was coming. I dont know if anybody else already said that, but removing the X-penalty is NOT doing anything to class balance. And that's what these threads are about, right? Removal of exp penalty has one effect: As a 40 SK one can group with a 40 Cleric for a year, with exp penalty they have to go different ways after a month. BUT, balance is about a 40SK and a 40WAR and a 40ROG etc...<P>so lets suppose you give the SKs a exp-BONUS. Lets say 50%. Do you think this would make a difference if a group is being formed? Oh, yeah, take the SK, he's levelling faster than we are, this will help in the next fight...<P>So DO NOT SAY you did anything to balance with the x removal. You only (and that is one of the greatest things you've done) made it possible for friends to stay together, no matter what class they played.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bel,<P>Just be glad they fixed it and leave it alone.  Besides, Axt is correct that for the last 2 years, hybrids have also been sucking a greater share of experience from groups.  This has now been stopped.  All in all, I think the result is a fair one.  Hybrids got an exp advantage in groups when the exp penalty was in place, and now the exp penalty is gone and they no longer get this exp advantage.

</FONT><HR>"1. Should there ever have been an exp penalty?<P>"No. Becuase once verant realized that people play the classes that are most powerful at highest levels they made HUGE increases to warrior class."<P>Erm.  You're contradicting yourself.  You're asking, "Should there EVER have been an exp penalty?", and answering "No, because well over a year after release they made warriors better".  Huh?  What about that first year?  Quite frankly, I think the first year, the exp penalty was merited.  No, not now, and I'm glad they changed it, but frankly, before Kunark, there wasn't much reason at -all- to play a warrior over a ranger.<P>"2. Was the hybrid penalty unfair since warriors were improved so much."<P>"Of course it was how can you argue it wasnt."<P>SINCE warriors were improved?  Aye, it isn't appropriate anymore.  But it was appropriate beforehand.  And I'm kinda glad that they take a little while to see overall effects of a change before making radical additional changes that could just as well make things swing the other way too much.<P><BR>3. Is there a grey area between improvements and removing penatlies.<P>"Sure there is, but this is the most qualtifiable black and white no argument clear cut example of something never should have been in the game that I can possibly think of."<P>I hope I've already argued this.  Pre Kunark, the hybrid penalty was completely justified.  Your argument is not black and white.<P><BR>"My point that both you and abashi missed is this. Ballance the classes as if the exp penalty never existed ever. Dont say "Its ok Hybrids are weaker because we just gave them more exp". Just pretend it never existed when looking at ballacing.  Am I wrong???"<P>I'm guessing that they've been balancing the classes with the exp penalty in mind ALL ALONG.  They value things like utility spells, etc. (which they refer to as versatility) pretty highly, maybe higher than a percentage of the players do (me, I most DEFINETLY consider the fact that when I've just gotten a port to Dreadlands, I can camo, sow, levitate, and run miles high above the giants and yetis to Karnors.  I can only imagine the hell a warrior goes through having to go unsowed, uncamoed, unlevved.  If he takes one death that way that I can easily avoid, isn't that an exp penalty?).<P>Anyways.  I think they've given us a TON, a TON of improvements lately.  How about casting spells no longer resetting swing delay?  That was HUGE!  Very MUCH balance-altering.  Disciplines, new spells and buffs.... <P>I really think that my fellow hybrids on this board need to get a grip.  Every hybrid I know in game is ecstatic.<P>If you think about the 12 or so improvements that hybrids have gotten recently, and all you can think is "too little too late", face it, you're never going to be happy no matter what they do, and you might as well just stop waiting for them to make you happy (it's impossible without being hideously unfair to someone else), and just don't play a hybrid anymore.<P>Qwinn Windfletcher<BR>51st Ranger<BR>Tunare Server<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Beld, normally I am with you on most issues but I think you are off-base with this one bud.<P>I understand the point you are trying to make which is "Don't neglect to balance the classes power-wise because you just removed out exp penalty, That doesn't count"<P>Survivability and desireability in a group are still issues that need to be balanced, agreed and removal of a ridiculous penalty should not be added to a list of things we were given if that means we don't get something else...<P>BUT, just because a situation was wrong to begin with does not mean that corecting it is not an improvement. It is an improvement albiet an overdue one.<P>Argue the remainder of the bybrid issues but let this one die  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>-Aetherial<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Beldukil, your initial post was not as clearly worded as I would have liked, I never understood it until Terewar clarified it.<P>That being said, Absor and Abashi, do you consider this to be part of the class balance for hybrids? When talking class balance most players, myself included, consider balance to be balance in playability terms, not in experience terms.<P>Also, was this mentioned to the mages/wizards/necromancers/enchanters? Why was it only mentioned in the SK thread?<P>Absor, a piece of advice, don't paint yourself into a corner like that.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Abashi - I've never been a fan of yours because of the statements you've made about Hybrids over the past 2 years. (whenever you came on board)  I GAVE UP on my Paladin after 40 levels because there was just TOO MUCH wrong with them that you said was UNCHANGEABLE.  I'm miffed at the experiance turned around.  I started a warrior to replace my "broken" paladin, and the DAY I hit level 40 with my warrior, you guys announce that the "set in stone" experiance penalty is being removed.  GEEZ.  It apparantly takes everyone quitting a class or refusing to group with them to get you guys to see the light.<P>Will you guys now ever see the light on the paladin spells????  I'm referring to when paladins get cleric spells post level 20 or so.  They are too little too late.  I've done many analysis on ALL the cleric/paladin spells and posted many times.  I haven't posted in the past 5-6 months since it didn't do any good.  I'm not going to spend the hours and hours for a complete comparision like I've done before, I'll just do one.  Clerics get an exp res at level 39.  I've been playing the eastern wastes with my warrior lately.  Most people that die there refuse a level 39 res and hold out an hour or 2 or 3 to try for a cleric level 49+ res.  THAT'S the reality of the game.  Having a paladin get a NON_EXPERIANCE res at level 49 is WORTHLESS.  Giving them a level 39 cleric res at 49 is STILL 10 levels after the cleric.  <P>I would hope that you'd see the same issue applies to the rest of the paladin spells...TOO LITTLE TOO LATE.   The removal of the experiance penality was long over due, but before I'd use my paladin again, something would have to be done about the spells and the offensive aspects also.<P>Tashroot Howlingpaws - 45th Season Halfling Druid<BR>BashorTash - 40th Season Dwarf Warrior<BR>Holitash Faithkeeper - 40th Season Dwarf Paladin<BR>Anatash Shadowknife - 29th Season Halfling Rogue<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok I did some research and the example they gave of a Hybrid who is 60 with level 41 skills would not happen.<P>Now if you are talking about a Level 60 ranger we have level 40! defensive skills.<P>Back to the exp issue.<P>If they were to adjust the exp table to the exp Hybrids Have they would gain between 3 and 4 levels starting at level 20.<P>Thats right a Hybrid would not get 10 or 15 levels.<P>Just some thing to point out.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/051962-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/051962-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/051962-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=051962&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=051962&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
