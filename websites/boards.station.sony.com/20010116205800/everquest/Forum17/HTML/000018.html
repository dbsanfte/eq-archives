</FONT><HR>Hello, I'd like to bring to your attention a rather nasty and sneaky individual.  A necromancer named "Jumbler".<P>This man decided that it was a good idea to KS the Hadden spawn from my Guildmate after she'd been waiting for him for close to 24 hours.<P>He then gated out, and logged off.  Nice eh?<P>After this, I found him online a day or so later, I confronted him with this and he stated "Oh, my cousin had access to the account, I don't know anything about it."<P>Even if I didn't think he was lying, I'm sorry, that doesn't fly.  You own the account, you're responsible for whatever your characters do.  <P>So, just a warning to all of you, he thinks nothing of wasting anyone's time since the unavoidable "camp" situation will always exist.<P>Prae Neithan - Guild Leader<BR>Order of the Luminous Blade</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I feel I must add a little bit to this post seen as how a guild leader of a Guild I respect is bashing a friend of mine.  I happen to know what happened that night and I do not like it one bit.  First off My friend Jumbler walks up on the spawn and sees Hadden up and no one around in the area so he sits there and roots the spawn and casts his Necro Dots on the mob now after he has 3 of his Dots (one being VoS doing 500 dmg in 30 secs) he hears someone say please don't KS but still not seeing anyone it seems this person was hiding or invis so he stopped and the other person starts to kill it.  Jumbler then sees the message You Gain Experience!  as his Dots killed Hadden.  Now Jumbler started getting tells from people in The Order of the Luminous Blade saying "you are a marked man"  "you are blacklisted"  "you are a dead man" so he decided to loot Hadden and didnt even get a fishbone earring just about 4 plat.  Personally I think there are 2 sides to every story Prae, and if your guild member was sitting there hiding or invis on a rare spawn like that instead of letting it known that they were camping it then they are foolish.  As for all the threats being made towards my friend Jumbler I would hate to have to discontinue being friends with some of the Blade but I find acts like this childish and with no base for merrit.  <P>I have spent many times at camps only to have them stollen from me in the past where people are invisible and pop out and nuke a spawn like the Ancien Croc in guk or the Ancient Cyclopse and take the loot and leave I understand situations like that and those I find unfair.  But as a leader of a guild I think you should look at all the information before going off half ****ed and threatening players I thought the Luminous Blade was better than that, and I would have thought that the leader of a respected guild like this would have been better than making an insane post like this as well.  Feel free to threaten me for this post as well I will accept all challenges no matter what level if you are willing to meet me in an arena.<P>I humbly await your response.<P>Mordeith Bonewalker<BR>Executive Officer of the Legion of Blood</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hey Prae, idle threats don't fly around me and i fear no wrath of which you could inflict for everytime i shall return and be stronger than before. $h*t happens and when it does either roll with it or just get knocked down. Everyone has been KS'ed horribly at one time or another. So dont make threats to ones such as the Legion or the legionnaires will make your death slow and painful.<BR>Have A Nice Day!!<BR>Zalak Dreadhammer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If a player sits at a camp and is hiden or Inv then that player does deserve to have the spawn taken from him/her. Jumbler did the responsible thing by backing off the spawn. Why did the player wait till after Jum cast his Root and DOTs to say something? AFK? Or not paying attn to the game. Or this may have been the scene:<P>Jumbler comes up and sees the Hadden spawn.<BR>Jumbler looks around and desides to kill the Hadden spawn <BR>Hidden player desides to let jumbles help kill the Hadden spawn so that hidden player does not have to work as hard.<BR>Hidden player lets Jumbler cast a few spells and then starts to say KSer KSer.<BR>Jumbler backs off so that he is not KSing the Hadden spawn .<BR>Hidden player tryes to finish off the Hadden spawn that has been DOTed so hidden player can not get 51% of the kill and loses the Experience.<P>No I was not at the scene but I have fought with Jumbler and he is a good and trusted guild member. So in my beliefs Jumbler did nothing wrong.<P>If you and a different opion on this subject please send it to the following address:<BR>Aggnot@Williamshaven.com<BR>Subject: Jumbler<P>Aggnot Damightybasher<BR>Founding Member, Executive Officer, & Sargent of Arms of the Legion of Blood<P>“… your death will come fast and painful as you feel the sting of my blade, you’ll know that death is descending upon thee. Despair grips your heart and fear freezes the very marrow of your bones. As your life-blood quenches the parched soil and the earth embraces your battered and beaten body, You will know that justice has been served this day.” <BR>– Aggnot Damightybasher<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Spoke with your boyss GM about this already, but, Jumbler provided no explanation to me when I contacted him, nor has he bothered to do so since.<P>My guildmember was there when he popped, no casting was done until after she started combat.  That makes it a KS.  If he had INDEED rooted Hadden, which I doubt, all he had to do was speak up.  We're pretty reasonable folks and she would have gone on her merry way, or waited for the next one.  He didn't.  He blasted, looted and gated out.  No talk, no explanation.  I have screenshots of the aftermath, so yes, I know.<P>As far as I'm concerned, I spoke with your Jumbler pal and your GM, and this is settled.  Nothing we can do about it now, it's a done deal, just have to make sure that we're not placed in a position like this again. Hence us instituting a multi-partner camp rule.  If two people say the same thing and has screenshots, guess you can't refute that.<P>Dunno anything about him being a marked man, but maybe if he'd tried explaining himself a little instead of ignoring people that wanted to ask him questions, maybe we wouldn't dislike him so much.<P>I also notice he hasn't posted here or on my board in his defence.  Little shady if you ask me.<P>Anyhow, done deal kids, not going to waste any more time on it, just going to be a little more mindful of things in the future is all.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As far as i'm concerned Jumbler is a collasal player.  I've never had or heard any problems with him.  I've grouped with him on many occasions.  I've seen him give full sets of bronze, plat and subject quests for newbies.  Very freindly guy, and if you say you have cleared the matter up with him then it appears he is honorable or tries to be.  Either way, when ever I see him its always a friendly hello.   :o)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum17&number=17&thisthread=000018&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum17&number=17&thisthread=000018&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
