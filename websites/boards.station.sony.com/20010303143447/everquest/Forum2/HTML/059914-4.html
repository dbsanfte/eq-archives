</FONT><HR>A way to solve the naked caster problem is to make casters item dependant like melee characters are.  <P>At level 1 as a SK I had no armor, a crappy weapon, and I could still kill things.  Now that I am level 40, if I even think of attacking a mob, I'd better be dressed and have a weapon in my hand.<P>At lower levels, casters are just as independent as melee as far as items go.  None and they do fine, any item worn increases effectiveness, but not too much.  At higher levels (I'm talking below 50, highest char is level 40), casters take the cake. they can have 4 things on their person (both melee, range and ammo), and obliterate pretty much whatever they want (pc-wise) except maybe a warrior because of their massive hitpoint reservoir.  <P>Also, try to fix fear and charm.  Yeah, I hated being charmed and feared, but the loss of those spells pretty much make enchanters useless in PvP encounters.  <P>I'd also like to see the faction hits back on Rallos, but only if there is a way to mark the agressor, so when I defend myself I don't lose faction.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello Absor, Fellow PvP'rs, etc, etc<P>Alethal here for those that know me. (love my station name)<P>PvP talks again, here we go.<P>1.)  Delevelers - a player who levels up to get certain skills, or cap in skills and then exp dies multiple times so that they are in PvP range of players without these skills. This gives an unfair advantage and may not be something that is easily fixed in the game as the exp loss for death is something strongly viewed by the live team.   This needs some thought and work, imagine a level 20 warrior with a level 50 warrior skill able to attack a level 12 wizard.<P>2.) Vallon / Tallon Cross teaming. In no way is this a bash or flame to the people who do this, but the servers where made as team servers and multiple people group, guild, pvp, pve with members of other teams giving them an unfair advantage that others who follow the "ideal" of the server do not have. This could be reduced by adding a check in the group / guild add for team status. This could be reduced further by not allowing cross team beneficial spells such as buffs or heals (another check process).   I am not sure the amount of processor increase this would cause for the physical machine but i would guess not much.<P>3.) SK's and Paladins.<BR>  a.) my view on sk and paladins differs from that of the live team so I dont expect this section to be taken seriously. <BR>  b.) paladins are a cross of clerics/warriors and should be defensive, sk's are a cross of necro/warriors and should be more offensive then paladins (look at our only special skills)<BR>  c.) PvP death now does not refresh the SK's Harm Touch, yet it does the paladins LoH<BR>  d.) in PvP sk special skill is a DD spell that is reduced 68% now, paladins is a Heal that isnt reduced at all as that would be stupid.<BR>  e.) If sk's where made more offensive (bash, taunt, offensive, necro offensive spells) increased rather then the view that they are a defensive class this would resolve lots.<P>4.) Faction hits - i dont like them (sorry everything is in detail but this one)<P>5.) GM's, Guide's.  I think that a gm or guide should change races when it is applicale (helping a dark elf) as this is more realistic then seeing a wood elf (no offense flechette) helping a buch of dark team members.  ( this may be a hassle but can be done and makes game more fun for us Team players)  im a lil null on the abilities of GM's changing as I am not allowed to join the guide program because of my past affiliations with various unnamed news networks. But I know they can this somewhat (gm events and what not)     every time i see a gnome i just want to wack em... cant help it ;-p<P>6.) Thank you for your time and your concern in the matter.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is from a Rallos Zek Player point of View, I have no input or concerns with teams based PVP servers.<P>The problem in RZ since day one is item looting. There are three options, better than what's currently in place.<P>1. Nerf Item Loot and implement Coin Loot. We all know the Pros and Cons. Factual data available on the Teams Servers. No need to comment further.<P>2. Even the risk/reward ratio. I think the way to even the playing field is by implementing an experience penalty upon PVP death. I think 1 blue bub. or 1/5 of a yellow bub. is an appropiate penalty to begin with. Pre-Kunark experience after level 35 was very scarce, now with Kunark and SoV there is a wide range of ways of gaining experience at all levels, making exp loss a viable option to consider for a penalty.<BR>On Item looting. Make a Random based looting system. Example:<BR>A. winner 4 levels lower than looser - then there is a 10% chance of getting an equiped item or 25% chance of inventory item. Otherwise Coin Only.<BR>B. winner 3 levels lower than looser - then there is a 8% chance of getting an equiped item or 25% chance of inventory item. Otherwise Coin Only.<BR>c. winner 2 levels lower than looser - 7% chance equiped item or 25% chance of inventory item. <BR>D. winner 1 levels lower than looser - 6% equiped item or 25% chance inventory item. <BR>D. winner same level as looser - 5% chance of geeting equiped item or 25% chance inventory item. <BR>E. winner higher level than looser - 0% chance of geeting equiped item or 5% chance inventory item. <P>This should be easy to implement. No changes to GUI or game dynamics.<P>3. Choice 3. If none of the above gets implemented. Open a /movelog to any blue or team server. <P>DO something! Usually there are more that 5000 accounts playing at peak time on the PVP servers. That's a conservative number. That's more than $50K. That more than enough to maintain the servers and dedicate on developer to PVP. No excuse for lack of action. <P>Thanks for reading.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One more post.<P>I see alot of my class cant kill that class posts, I dont think EQ is nor should be 'balanced' to fight one-one.. this isnt tekken nor is it street-fighter or whatever. Group vs Group all classes work fine. Wizards may not be able to outdamage the healing a healer can do but how can that healer heal with rogues monks or warriors on him? not very well I will tell you that. EQ PVP is a group game, and should be such. The 66% dd nuke nerf was a good one in my oppinion, any ability in game to be a one shot kill is totaly unbalanced and totaly out of place in a pvp game.<P>I think EQ PvP works just fine, most people think of who they can duel/beat 1-1 with their class and say SEEE ITS BROKEN! whereas this is totaly the wrong way to look at it, look at it the same way you deal with PVE. wizards coming at you? interrupt/bashes/slams/stuns are your friends! tactics only really become possible in group combat and thats where EQ shines.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>In contrast to Arkons...<P>I want to throw my support to con:<P>Red/white/green<P>white = in range. <P>That way, you cant be truly sure if you are attacking someone more powerful than you or not.<P>One of the biggest legitimate complaints i have seen from the anti-pk crowd is that most of the fights are murders with the outcome pre-determined. this would go a LONG way to changing that, and would add a lot of risk to the professional pk crowd, as it should. This should not be risk free, there should be some fear in the attacker that he is attacking someone who is going to wipe him out.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Rallos Zek only<P>- Coin only loot. Reason for this is that pvp isn't really balanced as it should be in Everquest, espically in end game. Items are too rare and too valible. Some unsavory indivduals take advantage of portals and zone gates to for this reason. Easy kill, easy loot.<P>- Unfriendly AE's. Works well if your killing another player, but useless in PvE situation because you will hit your own group. Maybe if you make group members immuned to each others offense spells we could use AE in limited PvE situations. (i.e. single group encounters, wouldn't work in raid situations)<P>Team PvP<P>- Disable personal /tells and /group chat for opposing teams. This would discourage cross teaming because the only way you could talk to your group would be either /say or /shout<P><BR>General PvP<P>- Unresistible spells. Currently lures, taps, lighting type spells?, and a few others are nearly unresistible. Give them a save vs. players if your resists were high enough would help.<P>- Melee damage - currently spells only hit 66% of there max damage. (still too high for some high end spells imho) Yet melee hits for full damage. Purhaps 10% reduction would negate some of tremendious damage potinal of some weapons.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>honestly , there really should be two ( 2 ) pvp threads , one dealing with Rallos , the other dealing with the 2 teams server..... <P>pvp is just not the same on the 2 different kinds of servers....<P>plain and simple , the worst thing about pvp on RZ is item loot..... it's good enough for the teams , but not good enough for us eh? <P>if you can't see yourself clear to making RZ coin only ,   some of us would really like a move to a coin-only server , or heck , even a blue server.<P>portal camping , zone camping , mindless ganking is not what I envisioned for PVP , logging on half dead already , and smacking myself for logging off un bagged , or not logging in a safe place ( same from PC's , not NPC's ) is not very enjoyable ,  <P>another big problem..... PVP in gfay and highpass banks , there need to be more stationary guards there , and higher guard agro ranges , it's a real pain in the rump to be banking and be almost dead _BEFORE_ I realized I'm being bank ganked.<P>honestly , these probably aren't the only 2 banks with the prob , you can kill people in rivervale and freeport as well at the banks... might be a good idea to make the guards immune to harmony , so they can't stand by and watch people get attacked. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>ive played on tallon zek for over a year and heres my take on the pvp team servers tallon and vallon zek.<P>The main problem about these servers is that they unintentionally punish people who play the server as a team.  <P>     On Tallon there is a guild called Pandemonium which consists of many well equipped high level players of all races.  There is also a "Light Alliance" formed by a bunch of people who read too much Tolkien, which basically believes in Good Vs. Evil (GvE), or in the case of this server trolls, dark elves, ogres, and iksar vs everyone else.  The existence of both of these are major problems to people who play with single teams.<P>   Because of pvp coding this guild pandemonium is allowed to bring in a dark elf cleric along with their humans and halflings to come heal them in fights vs the dark team.  The darks cant do anything about these clerics except hope to /duel or /guildwar them (either of which anyone would do because of the hometown faction hits) thus giving pandemonium a bit of an unfair advantage.  <P>   This same problem exists for those who want to play "light" characters who play aggressive towards players of different races, such as shorts who kill humans.  The players of the "light alliance" will send in a healer of the same race to heal against the one teamers just as pandemonium does against the darks.<P>  Something has be changed about this healing exploit, here are 4 different solutions to this problem:<P>1)  Disable all crossteam buffing, healing, or grouping.  keep crossteaming ressurection since it is mainly used as a courtesy to the losing players after battle.<P>2) Create an aggressor flag, which disables crossteam healing after a player is has taken part in any pvp<P>3)  create a flag which enables players to hit players of same races if they do heal other races<P>4)  change tallon zek into a guildwar server<P>The other flaw i find in pvp servers is team/class balance.  Humans have every class. darks dont have druids, rangers, paladins, and bards.  Shorts dont have monks, shadowknights, bards, rangers, and shamans.  Elves dont have necromancers, shadowknights, monks, and shamans.  <P>This gives some teams major advantages over others, mainly humans have the advantage over everyone else.  Because of the team inbalances and the "Lights" Tolkienistic ideas this adds up to a 9 vs 4 server the 4 having far less classes, and the rebels who are one of the 9 races but attack everyone having a class disadvantage and no tracking.  <BR>I personally would really like to see new race/class combinations that would make this a little more even such as:<P>Dark elf druids of innoruuk:  A mockery of the Druids of Tunare courtesy of Papa Innoruuk.<P>Dark elf bards:  No reason not to have them, could warship rallos zek<P>Iksar rangers of cazic:  iksars can forage, why not just give them a cazic worshipping track class too.<P>Halfling monks<P>Halfling shamans<P>Gnome bards<P>High elf necromancers:  went the evil path just like the erudites<P>High elf shadowknights:  see above<P>High elf monks<P>wood elf shamans  <P>I realize that these changes will most likely never happen, but if they did it could really spice up these dying servers, i personally would play a dark elf bard with more than a passing interest.  Plus it would give team balance, and encourage playing single teams as the server was designed for.<P>Thanks absor for the pvp forum btw, came to me as a bit of a surprise<P>Level 50 Magician<BR>Tallon Zek Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1. No teams. Teams are stupid and ignore good roleplaying - therefore there are no evil bards, no sneaky, duplicitous Dark Elves. Not fair, say I.<P>2. Everyone starts out dubious to everything. (apart from aggro mobs). This way killing your own race will involve BAD faction hits from the get go. In fact, you'd have to build faction first before engaging in PvP.<P>3. Faction hits for PvP aggressors - even if you LOSE. Again, being the aggressor should carry severe penalties in any civilised society.<P>4. No faction hits if duelling or fighting in an Arena. So you can practise with your buddies.<P>5. The classes are balanced so that melee can actually fight caster and the outcome is not a forgone conclusion. The classes in EQ are not designed for PvP - one group clearly have an advantage in a PvP situations.<P>6. Pets don't outdamage melee at the same level. In fact pets should be mere shadows of melee classes.<P>7. Items not lootable. There may be an argument for cash loot, but with items being as hard as they are to obtain in EQ allowing them to be easily ganked is nothing less than criminal negligence on the part of the designers. I would prefer to see the loot being the character's head - allowing people to play bounty hunters.<P>8. No level limit to PvP. There should be a penalty for annoying higher level characters - the risk should be your imminent demise. Also, one would assume that those who have earned the higher ranks would be a little more mature in selecting their PvP targets.<P>9. You should be unable to injure a member of your own group. Allowing casters to do AoE spells.<P>10. The leader of a group should be able to expel a member of their group. So the group can fall upon any member accused of wrong-doing.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alright, my first idea for helping to balance PvP:<BR>Remove the 1/3 damage cap on DD's only.<P>Make all Root/Snare/Darkness spells drop on the first DD cast on them or the first melee attack by the opponent.<BR>This will help balance fear kiting or snare kiting by necros, shadowknights, or druids, rangers, or wizards.<P>Make DoTs NOT remove Snare/Root/Darkness but do only 1/3 damage if the target is moving, 1/2 if target is standing still (dots are very, very, very overpowered).<P>Drop prices on vendor-sold potions, and increase types of potions sold in towns where shamans are a playable race. Put a level range on the potions that is adequate for the type of spell, i.e., don't let under level 9's use sow potion, and base it upon that race's modifier of when (if ever, any available class to that race) would get that spell. This would mildly even the playing field for melee classes, by giving them access to PvP vital things such as Invis.<P>Increase Paladin Damage by a flat percent, like 10-15. Currently, Paladins are pathetic PvP.<P>OK.. This is complicated... Make Resist Debuffs do a flat rate (Against MoBs) and versus other players make it a *lower* flat rate (than currently in place) and ADD a percentage based amount that increases with level & level of the spell.<P>Put charm back in, and fix bugs.<P>How about..<BR>Make guards level 15ish but make them the way certain NPCs are right now, where the automatically *poof* and give NO exp or loot upon death. <BR>This will increase the likelyness of city raids, and create the possibility of taking over other's town's again.<BR>No PvP for characters under level 5 on at least RZ. Give people a chance to experience the server without being slain by an angry person visiting from the blue servers.<P>Fix Deleveling. Make it like spells.. if you lose levels, you can't lose skills, including losing new skill caps & skill ranges ala monk, rogue, warrior, etc etc.<P>More to come..<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Greetings Absor!<P>Having just finished reading the three pages of posts and incorporating my own ideas, this is what I've come up with (I've only played on Rallos Zek, so my ideas are for that server alone):<P>Egg-Shaped Pumice Stones<BR>This is probably the one thing everyone agrees on.  We really need these back on Rallos Zek (and probably on the teams servers as well).  It is the only way for non-casters to level the playing field.  It is also the easiest for your team to implement since they were already there once.<P>Newbie Killing<BR>This is a major problem in that the newbie areas of every zone (except maybe Tox forest) look like battlefields.  People will come to the PvP servers when their servers are down just to run around and randomly attack people.  It makes getting started incredibly difficult.  A good solution would be to simple disallow PvP prior to level 10.  I don't know how difficult this would be to code, but you guys are pretty clever and I'm sure you could implement this without too much difficulty.<P>Ganking/Zone Camping<BR>This is PvP of the lowest caliber.  Typically casters will wait at dungeon zone points and blast anyone who emerges low on health.  A simple solution would be to make the victim's corpse unlootable unless the assailant did at least 51% of the damage.  This will also prevent accidental EXP loss as would-be gankers root someone in front of an agro'ed mob and then wait till the person's health is low enough that they can kill them in one hit.  If they fizzle or just miscalculate, then the person dies and suffers EXP loss.  The 51% rule would greatly mitigate this situation.<P>Looting<BR>If the above anti-ganking measure were implemented, I see no reason not to leave Rallos Zek as item loot.  For really nice items, however, you could introduce a difficult quest that would allow the person to make a piece of equipment NO-DROP thereby soulbinding it to their person.<P>PvP Spell Damage<BR>As other people have stated, PvP spell damage is reduce by a flat percentage across the board.  This should be reconsidered and adjusted on a sliding scale.  At lower levels, for example, it is virtually impossible for a caster to kill a well-equipmed tank.  At the upper levels (50+), however, Druids and Necros can kill with a single DoT!  In fact, DoTs are FAR more powerful at the upper levels than even Wizard's nukes.  You may find that, in the interest of balance, high level DOTs need a steeper damage penalty in PvP.<P>Portal Camping<BR>This tends to be a real problem.  One simple solution would be to create a no-fire zone or perimeter around the portal.  Maybe even put some guards there (I don't know how feasible that would be).<P>That is basically it for now.  I have a few other ideas, but they are mostly derivative from the base ideas listed above.<P><BR>Sincerely,<BR>Kalares<BR>Denizen of Rallos Zek<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Aereon:<P>Hah, that is why RZ is a REAL server and not a pansy one like Vallon/Tallon. People feel more emotions then just happiness! It's what gives RZ LIFE, it's what makes it REAL. That not only can you feel happiness, but you can feel pain, and it hurts. You worry, you care. The world is not an amusement park where everyday is a cotton candy, ferris wheel fun day... such is reflected in RZ. <P>That is the magic of RZ, you feel the pain of loss when there really isn't one at all! People get enraged, get betrayed by other people, and all of this is virtual, but yet, it feels so very real. Where else can you experience that? None other than the virtual world of RZ  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"> NO OTHER server has the bitter twisted politics like we do. NO OTHER server has the wars, and  bitter hatred that blossoms from betrayal. NO OTHER server can get in your face like RZ... and the players on it. Some people just can't deal with it, others thrive in it. <P>That's where the enjoyment is, it's being able to enjoy the whole variety of emotions... yes, to enjoy anger, to enjoy pain. Masochistic? Nah, I wouldn't put it like that. It's like living life, but not your own, in a "safe" environment... Some people prefer to just play games to be happy, others can find more then that on RZ.<P>Arkons:<P>About the planar loot thing. No one should acquire planar loot through pvp. No matter how lucky/awesome you (ambigious you) are in pvp, your mad skillz should never be that rewarding. Can you really justify that a quick nuke at the rigth time is worthy of the prospect of looting an Indicolite breastplate, or a Carmine Robe, knowing the agony involved in acquiring those loots? It requires 10 times the manpower, and 10 times the time it takes to get a Carmine Robe then it does to get an SMR, or to get a diamond ring, or whatever "planar-loot-deficient" pvp'rs use. Having planar loot droppable, i think, would just result in more bagged people on the server, and I don't think we need more naked people walking around.<P>Yes, I understand that there is a slight "disadvantage" to those that do not have the ability to get planar loot, but that's nothing they can't remedy by getting their act together and either joining a planar group or starting their own. A group of SIX (who know what they are doing), can clear fear if Cazic is not up. A group of TWELVE (who know what they are doing), can break HATE, and only SIX are needed to farm it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>/em Cracking his knuckles.<P>I'm going to lay it all out.<P>1) GM/Guides do nothing about people who break the rules that should have people banned instantly. They say that they have to witness people exploiting other players and I can understand that but why can't they watch banks and portals while invisible from time to time.<P>Bannable offensives are bind, portal, zone, and corpse camp. Also bank and experience killing are bannable offences. There use to me a MOTD posted ever time we logged on to Rallos Zek warning about doing them and the consequences.<P>2) Gm/Guides that come from other servers that come to Rallos are totally clueless about about the PvP environment and therefore they do not respond properly.<P>3) Showeq needs to be dealt with. The person who uses it has a serious advantage over the ones who do not use it. <P>4) Dark races needs tracking ability period.<P>5) Harm Touch is insane for the post 50 SKs and as a caster I have NO PROBLEM with this. The Wizards use to be the one shot one kill wonders and that's why there are so many of them. My problem is the lower levels SKs. Picture this, you and a friend make SKs and plan to pk all the newbies. You and your buddy finds a victim and y'all use HT to start the fight. One of you keep the victim busy while the other gets killed by the guard and then runs back towards the victim and hit him with HT and his is dead. Wash, rinse, & repeat the cycle. This needs to be fixed.<P>6) There should be a penalty for kinslayers and killing other races. Player A cast upon Player B and Player B kills Player A then Player A should get the penalty for starting the fight (not a duel). Now let's look at it this way, Player A attacks Player B and Player A kills Player B then Player A still gets the faction hit again for starting the fight. Last scenario. Player A cast on Player B and the fight ends because they were just playing or one has gated, then there is no faction hit.<P>7) Remove potions that removes diseases and poisons because there is NOT a potion to STOP a DD so there shouldn't be any that can stop a DoT.<P>Other than these things, I think Rallos Zek is just fine. Don't make it coin loot only because there is a PvP server that is already coin loot and making Rallos Zek coin only will not STOP pkers from pking them. Also don’t make spells or spell books lootable unless you make weapons lootable to.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>PvP Teams problems<P>1) Cross Teaming -- Grouping with all races is acceptable on PvE servers (though it is a slap in the face to roleplayers), but it is an exploit on PvP servers.  It is cloaked with the ideal of "social interaction" but on this server that is such a lie.  We all know people like to take advantage of any given situation in PvP and having an immortal healer/buffer by x-teaming is such a glaringly obvious advantage that I’m amazed this has never been addressed.  We try to police ourselves on this server as best we can but be realistic -- Human nature does not lend itself to discipline =P.  You already can’t cast damaging spells on members of your own team, please make it so you can’t cast beneficial spells on opposing teams.  If x-teaming is to be allowed, then you should take the “teams” out of PvP teams server and call it “Mildly hindered player killer server” because that’s all it really is.  Luckily, most of the players enjoy the ideal of a true teams server, but the ones who do not cause HUGE problems.  They know X-teaming is an exploit, and it is naive for anyone to think they stop there with exploits, grief playing, and general anti-social behavior.<P>2) Pumice Please --  Unresistable mega-dmg DOT’s makes PvP a real pain vs certain casters.  Egg-shaped pumice was the only defense but now that it is nerfed to crystalline pumice, it is all but useless for most.  Pure melee’s can’t cast a pumice during a battle at all because they have no channeling skill ( 1pt of dmg interrupts every time).  Please put in a self-only instant-cast pumice.  It’s hard enough to maneuver this item during a heated PvP fight and it’s not like you will always be prepared.  This would not make DOT’s useless, rather it would give melee SOME defense against massive DOT’s such as splurt, winged death, etc...<P>3) Havoc – this is what I call the “warping” or running in circles you experience in the game when trying to run after or follow someone.  It screws up the /follow command and is a real headache when pursuing someone in a PvP encounter.  All a caster has to do is run a bit over a hill and they’ve ditched the melee.  Unload the nukes and tank is dead.  Is there anything that can be done about this?  <P>4)  Line of Sight --  It should not be possible to cast on players through walls just as it is not possible to cast on NPC's.  If the negative implications of keeping this "as is" aren't obvious you must be missing a few chromosones =P.<P>5) RULES!  --  Please give us some real rules to go by.  On Vallon we have introduced the idea of “Loot an’ Scoot”.  Basically, it means that if you are killed by another player during and honorable fight, then you should loot your things and leave the zone for 1 hour.  It works well and most guilds abide by it but by no means does everyone accept this.  What we need on these servers is a stance that says we will have 0 tolerance  for grief tactics.  The idea is to keep PvP FUN for the majority of people who don’t engage in PvP just because we like to “hurt people”.  Most of us enjoy the excitement of PvP but mean no harm out of character.  We just want to keep our PvP ingame.  I.E. not causing xp death, no corpse camping, no immortal healing, no training, no bind rushing, no zone camping, and the list goes on.  We NEED a set of enforcable rules or else we are left with chaos and people going out of their way to injure the player behind the keyboard.  That is unacceptable in a GAME.<P>Others have mentioned some good ideas here and I’m glad VI is finally looking at PvP.  My observations come from play on Vallon Zek since its inception and I know they reflect the ideas of many others on the server. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I really enjoy pvp how it is for the most part.  Newbie pking is kind of rampant, but it is sort of an initiation thing to get to higher levels out of the ganking zone.  Sometimes I wish the level limit was enlarged so larger assemblies of people can participate in war activities and killing pks or visa versa. <P>Certain issues in pvp ought be left alone and others changed.<P>I'm not a pker but, I can say removing item loot would ruin the risk balance of pvp, since nobody would care if you died..even if ya had to walk a bit or med a bit.  I don't like losing items, but when I came to the server I accepted this as part of the game, and a consequence for the pvp environment.<P>People complain about over powered casters, but that only involves the lower levels who also have not so great equipment.  At high levels everyone is tough to kill, tanks the hardest due to superior hit points and superior resist gear.  Also people forget...I cast splurt, good pvper cancels it in 5 seconds, same with ignite blood or many others thought to be overpowered spells.<BR>Also the introduction of 66% caster damage helps balance it all out (sometimes too much for the tanks, although removing insta-pumice helped balance that out too)<P>Much of the ganking in high levels is caster vs caster..only time I could imagine a tank gettin ganked with 2k hp is if they are fighting a mob and their cleric went ld, or a group of pkers took an attempt.  Ice comet hurts but most 50+ tanks have easily 150+ sv cold, over 100 mr and over 120 fr (which actually surprisingly doesn't stop full dmg comet always).<P>Truthfully casters even out, you can't gank a tank in 1 hit and most of em wear growth or other plane armor.  Try rooting, or darknessing someone with 100 mr..you get your brains bashed in by duel lamentations and a haste item  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><BR>(I'm not a pk people)<P>Thank you for reading~<BR>~Killer of the People Killers,<BR>~52 Necromancer of Rallos Zek,<BR>Ice~~</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree, don't change much on Rallos, if you wanted to keep us as customers you should have tryed doing so way back, not right before everyone has Shadowbane Beta accounts, and already has there SB classes picked out. However ya can twink a few things up......<P>Get rid of the new Druid heal's, they DO NOT BELONG. You just turned an extremly deadly PvPer (The Druid) into the best PvP class by FAR. <P>The 2 biggest PvP guilds fear people using tatic's way agenst the rules, but if they do it once and leave how can a Guide see? You need to give people immunity when zoning, it's a huge exploit people use and it won't go away. 75% of Rallos Zek will begin attacking someone the second they appear in the zone, making them almost dead when they gain control. <P>About the lame guilds, it sound familar they get guild warnings, Guides threaten disbanding them next time... The Guilds then reform a new name, and have a clean sheet and get another warning and just reform again? Guess what it's done all the time by Begotten, and Family of Peace. Flame all ya want, but this is fact there are screen shots of Guides/GM's giving them warnings, they then have a new name within 2 weeks and get more warnings not long after again. <P>Training? I dunno if you can do something but would be nice. <P>Account theft? Believe it or not but it's a huge factor on Rallos and people make threats and come through with them all the time. <P>There are some other good suggestions but over all No huge changes would make me happy. Just fix some of the stupid stuff to make PvP a little more pleasent. <P>Sup Arkons, ill talk to you in game... However there are a few ways to heal better then Splurt, let's look at the stats... It's 198 Mana, and heals 0 HP's, so I do believe it's not worth the mana for you to use healing. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor:<P>The PvP problems on Rallos Zek are deep rooted and will require some work to be fixed properly. <P>I play a level 58 rogue and a level 54 Wizard on Rallos Zek.<P>I agree with many of the players here in that Loot is a main cause for many of the PvP that goes on. If there was no item loot the amount of Random PK's would dwindle to nothing. Item loot encourages opportunist ganking.<P>I always wear full gear when I PvP yet I do see peoples frustrations when dying in PVP and losing an item to a zone or portal camper. I think for those reasons no loot is the way to go. But I do also enjoy the thrill that comes in a fair pvp fight where both parties are prepared. It doesnt happen often but it does happen.<P>PvP is always going to have fundamental flaws which will put a stranglehold on the growth of the servers. People forget that most PvP conflicts inevitably turn into Zone Battles. Once this happens the PvP aspect is taken out of the game. At that point its all about who has the fasters PC and the best connection. Whoever zones first is able to get a cheap shot on the other player before they are able to get control of their player.  Its due to this that players often resort to zone plugging (killing their modem) so basically they zone in one side of a zone but kill the connection to internet before they load out the other side of the zone.  People zone plug because they are losing a fight or they are going to get ganked and lose an item.<P>Discrepency between casters and tanks if huge:<BR>Having played both a rogue to level 58 and wizard to level 54 I see both sides of the issue. Tanks have the advantage indoors and casters have the advantage outdoors.  Do you have any idea how frustrating it is to have a caster attack you in burning woods (or any other dense outdoor zone) and to try to fight them playing a melee? Its nearly impossible.  FLoating spells such as dead man floating and levitate also make it nearly impossible for tanks to hit casters in some circumstances. Casters will run up a elevation and float off it and cast spells while they are out of attack range of their target.<P>But by the same token: Casters get raped indoors. you find a tank with some 20 dly weapons hasted to max using a no drop haste items (hangman noose) etc..  and he will kill a caster in like 10 seconds.  <P>I feel that your live team is overlooking some serious issues in pvp.<P>1) Unresistable dots: Splurt, Winged death, etc... are nearly completly unresistable. If they are resisted its by pure luck. These are espescially hard on tanks who dont have dispell spells (since egg shaped pummice nerf). They can try using crystalized pummice but odds are with 0 channeling skill they wont get it off.  These dots that are unresistable can take a caster who is fully bufed to within 100 HP of being dead in 1 cast. <P>People need to remember that dots are all or nothing, there is no such thing as partially resisting splurt/winged death etc...  this is the reason why PvP players are so upset with these dots,  Direct damage spells can be resisted/partially resisted Quite frequently.<P>2) 33% damage nerf on spells:<BR>This is a double edged sword. By doing this you inadvertantly made healing spells 33% stronger. As it currently is once you add the 33% deduction and further deduction for players wearing resists gear your final damage to your target is often times less than the mana cost of the spell.  I can cast draught of fire on a player. It does just over 400 dmg assuming it hits full in pvp, more often then not its partially resisted, so this nuke that cost a wizard 215 mana is now down to about 300-200 pts of damage.  I have seen tests done on high level warrirors/Sk's/Pallys. I watched a level 59 wizard nuke a level 59 warrior unbuffed till he was OOM. warrior had about 15% hp left when it was over.  So basically DD's IMO arent the problem.  1 Remedy/superior healing/greater healing is Way better than a single nuke.  heals cant be resisted, they are very efficient.  <P>3) uber classes: Currently in PvP there were 2 uber classes. One of them was the shadowknight. They have been tamed by this last patch and for that I applaud verant. I spoke with a level 60 ogre SK on rallos zek who agreed with me that Harmtouch was overpowered in pvp. Players were sick of getting pummice raped (SK dumps a pummice on caster, uses /disc unholyaura and kills player instantly with harmtouch) and most players would not even attempt to fight Sk's because of this.<P>The other uber class is the druid. Besides being one of the most versatile classes in the game, the druid in its current form is the most deadly PvP class in the game.  The Winged Death/swarm series will not be resisted in pvp unless its a fluke. These dots do obnoxious damage in pvp and are fast acting. They can outheal almost every nuke they will get hit with. having superior heal/chloroblast/natures touch the druid is now able to dish out the second biggest nuke in the game (wildfire) along with some of the most wicked dots in the game (winged death) and also has the BEST buffs VS cold and fire in the game. Couple this with wolf form, spirit of cheetah/wolf regeneration, damage shields, and you have yourself a uber PVP class. No other class can compete with druids in a battle without the aid of activateable items such as egg pummices and Gank wands.<P>4) WANDS:  Remove them from PvP servers please.<BR>I am a wizard and I feel that the wands that drop in hate/fear have no.<P>Wizard wand of conflag- 3 charges of conflagration (level 44 nuke that does 600+ damage) no cast time. This item has no place on a pvp server.<P>Necros have a wand that has 3 charges of drain soul (i think thats the name) that basically has the same effect as the wizard wand but it heals the target.<P>I think you get my point.  The earring you get from lynuga in innothule swamp has 6 charges of spirit tap. Items like this are unbalancing in pvp.  Instant cast right click items support only ganking. there is no sport in right clicking an item.<P><BR>***<BR>moving on now, I think that the GM staff also has their work cut out for them. Most all of the GM staff is from blue servers. They dont understand the politics and play methods of the red servers. They dont understand all the little tricks we learn from months and months of playing on the server. couple that with the fact that the GMs will always only get half the story. I have seen people get bind camped for 30 mins, they return the favor and they get busted.  But thats the way things work. What I do object to is the fact that the common player has no knowledge on what is acceptable and unacceptable pvp behavior.  How are new players to PvP servers supposed to know that attacking players at guards is offlimits? How are casters to know that Casting through walls is illegal? Where is a rule set that players can read prior to playin a pvp server so they dont get their accounts warned for honest mistakes.  <P>What about the velious zones. players who have played PVP for long time know that PKing in bank zones is offlimits but what about zones like highkeep/kael drakkan/skyshrine that are hunting zones and also bank zones.  I have often asked guides I have seen these questions and always seem to get a diffrent answer.  players will often become the victim in situations like this to the guides/gm's interpretation of the rules.<P>I have basically stated the majority of the problems I feel are currently plaguing our PVP servers. I honestly dont believe we will ever see change and for that I am sorry. I think there is good potential here for some fun PVP. I do think however that seeing how the PVP servers have changed so much in the past years that the players SHOULD be allowed a one time only transfer to a pvp teams server or a mature blue server of their choice.  You guys are closing down class modifications soon so once those are done I feel it would be a good gesture by VI to offer a one time option for transfer.  <P>Anyhow I said more than enough. please look into some of these suggestions and see what can be done. <P>Thanks<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Let me tell you about my experience on PVP-Vallon Zek, albeit short. I intially went from a blue Server to PVP because it looked like it would be alot of fun. The idea of diffent races ganging up on each other sounded like a lot of fun and a better way to play the game. I figured it would add one more dimension to the game.<P>All went well at first, sure it was anoying to have so many people killing me as a newbie but it was fine and I quickly made friends and did fine. <P>All went well until I ran into my first case of Invulrable Healing. Needless to say one day I was fightin some darkie and along came one of his friends on the same team as me and started to heal him. Needless to say I got very, very angry and left. Figured it was only a precursor of things to come, and from what I have seen since on the boards, it looks like I was right.<P>As far as giving you a solution, I Can't. I have not thought about it that much because I saw the post from someone at Verant stating that Invulnerable healing was being perfectly acceptable, needless to say that just confirmed the fact that I would stay away from PVP. <P>All I can say is I would love to go back but something has to be done to deter this behavior. The only suggestion I could give is that of alowing same races to take Faction Hits against their own Race for assisting someone killing someone of their own race and possibly increasing the faction hit given for their own race. It also should drop thier invulnerable status for some set period of time if they aid other races in that manner. I would have to think that if people cant sell in their home town and are vulnerable to their own race, they would be less likely to participate in this behavior. <P>Thanks for looking at this and hopefully Verant will make some changes that will give me the confidence that the gameplay will be somewhat more balanced when it comes to invulnerable healing.<P>Thanks<P>Peredur</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi Absor  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Thanks for reading my first post about the cross teaming and uberguards; I can smell the changes a'comin lol.  Anyways, heres some other issues, not really in the league of the first two, but here goes:<P>First off, please ignore all cries of 'my class really sucks in PvP' unless they come from Enchanters.  Make a char on a PvP server, pretend to be a newbie and shout out what class is the weakest.  Yup.  As a shaman, I DOT myself with some disease and beat the enchanter down with my bare fists, as their mezzes break one after the other.  Not an enchanter, don't know much what they need, I think something about everyone in PvP wearing lots of MR gear, but please do something.<BR>Oh, btw, thanks for the SK HT nerf.  I saw SK's blow away casters like the wind.  I love my SK friends, but I thought that change was needed.<P>/e thinks.<P>Let's see, what else?  <P>Hmmmm.<P>/e furrows brow.<P>You know, that should about cover it.  Ok, to recap; cross-GvE healing bad, uber-guards bad, and do something for Enchanters because they bad too.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A few thoughts on Rallos (I have never played anywhere else, 45 necro, 22 warrior)...<P>I love the /con changes suggested. I think all white for in range would be great...but at least get rid of the out of range blue issue, it is not good to not be sure if someone can gank you or not (is he 1 level or 10 below me....?)<P>DO NOT get rid of item loot. Looks good on paper, but sounds like another nightmare on TZ/VZ. I have never looted an item from another player by the way. This is a tough call...I would love to wear my stuff sometimes, and you would think that it would alleviate some of the other issues, but I think it will just cause more.<P>Faction hits might make sense if you could use an aggressor flag. God that would be a big change though...<P>GM support. I agree that massive GM support is occasionally required to police the gankers. This may require GMs to actually log on characters and try some stuff. And make certain exploits BANNABLE first offense. Training, bank ganks, corpse/zone/portal ganks for example. This would require very clear rules written  and communciated. An idea: Go create a human wizzie in Freeport on Rallos and collect info for 4 hours on people violating the rules I listed. Then BAN them all. Do the same for all different spell circles. This would have a dramatic effect.<P>That is not all, I have to go, but thank you for taking the time!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>i have a couple of things to say about Rallos Zek pvp...<P>1. AE spells... they hurt my party members and my pet... i can live with hurting em, i guess, but please don't make my pet aggro on me if i hit it with an AE spell, or a bolt spell by accident... as a mage, AE spells make up half of my spells, yet, i never, ever use them, and am very hesitant to use bolt spells too...<P>2. DELEVELING - i was pked the other day by a guy in full planes armor... i was 20 at the time... HOW THE HECK DID A LVL 24 WARRIOR GET FULL NO DROP PLANES ARMOR AND THE EPIC WEAPON FOR THE WARRIOR?  this is just WRONG that he can do this...<P>3. Naked caster syndrome... i hear alot of people yelling about naked casters... from my past experience, the naked casters aren't that bad a problem.. it is the TWINKS who run around with a wurmslayer at lvl 5 and no armor, or the rogues with some awesome harpoon who backstabs ya for 100+ dmg at lvl 4 and has no armor on... there is no risk associated with them, just as there is no risk with naked casters... yet, the twinks seem much more common... at least from my own experience..  one thing that i have noticed alot of with very little done about it is, earth pets used at the guards to pk ya... the mage will sit there and send the pet in, let the pet almost kill ya, then blast ya one final time to get the kill...<P>4. Item loot... i really don't have that big a problem with it... but then again i haven't lost anything worth 1k pp yet either... i just wish that the items you quest for from solusek ro were all no drop... then i could actually wear my robe of the elements...<P>5. i think that cutting off pking to those less than lvl 10 is a decent idea.. however, it would not do that much.. people would just lvl to 10, then wait for everyone else to get to 10 and pk them in the zones where you hunt at lvl 10...<P>6. there is a bug that i have seen enchanters exploit in PVP... if you charm a player's pet, then pet will die when the charm wears off... this shouldn't happen...<P>7. the 50% dmg to loot is an EXCELLENT idea... i love it.. i hate being backstabbed for 150 dmg while i am medding after a fight and trying to heal up too.... i have lost several decent items this way... one hit, i was dead... just because they snuck up behind me and killed me when i was very low on health... <P>Just so you know.. i am not a PK, although at one time i was.. heck i was even one of the four founders of the PK guild i was in.. but, i quit when i realized just how STUPID just running around killing people for no reason was... ( as a mage, by the time i could kill em, they had bagged everything they had and destroyed their money...so i got nothing...)<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Im actually a hi lvl bard on rallos and so one would think I am super exposed to the ganking problem by naked casters. <P>The fact is , I LOVE IT the way it is and came here specifically for this looting scenario, leaving a lvl 51 wizard and other hi lvl characters on Vallon when they went coin only and starting over from SCRATCH on Rallos. I am not a pk. But some of us LOVE the risk of being on a server where there is more at stake than a little exp loss. If you will learn a few techniques to save yourself and your stuff instead of trying to "change the world" (The world known as Rallos Zek) then you will not only cut your problems in half about pk deaths and looting but you will also stop trying to ruin the game for the large group of people who have found what little refuge there is left in EQ for gutsy, hi risk lovers. <P>That is the world of Rallos Zek- the only one of what, 25+ servers?? only ONE- that offers the high adrenaline risk of losing something nice if you die to a player. The fact is, most pk's are dealt with SEVERELY and SWIFTLY by the other players on Rallos. There are guilds based COMPLETELY on killing pks. There's been times I have just been attacked- not killed- just attacked- and gotten 5 or more tells from TOTAL strangers asking me where the attacker was,lvl.,class,etc., so they could go kill him and avenge me. There is a VERY STRONG social code on Rallos to avenge people wronged by pks. This is FANTASTIC. <P>But it is also FANTASTIC that there ARE pks, who provide this exciting element of revenge, brotherhood, risk , adrenaline, etc., for the rest of us. Lets face it, EQ, like all games, can become boring. Especially when you have gotten post 50 and seen it all, just about. Rallos Zek keep me playing and keeps my dollars flowing to Sony and EQ, because it is still RISKY and EXCITING, a changing risky world still, all because of the player versus player element. <P>So why isn't it enough to have that, but coin only, like on Vallon and Tallon? I tried playing on Tallon and Vallon after the change to coin only there. It bored me to tears. People in pvp battles didn't care if they died. There was nothing to lose. Anyone not a moron banks all their money. The thrill was gone. The heated, exciting battles were history- people just didn't care if they died in pvp. No exp loss, no loss of anything really. Just a run to their body. <P><BR>Rallos is One single lonely outpost amongst all the other servers, providing choice and variety for those left who love the heartpumping thrill of having something to lose in pvp. Verant has explained their reason for having Vallon in very democratic terms-While they respect and fully honor majority rule (look at all the blue servers), they also believe it is right to protect certain inalienable rights of the minority groups, (same reason we have a bill of rights in the U.S.) so that the Crushing Will of the People doesn't drown out all dissent, creativity, and input from those off the beaten path, those who are free thinkers and those whose opinions, while not those of the majority, provide for a richer, fuller, more interesting world. <P>If you don't like Rallos the way it is, please STOP BEATING A DEAD HORSE- do what I did, but in reverse-Leave your High level Rallos characters and start over from scratch on a server that you like. If I can do it, why can't you. You have what? 25+ different servers from which to choose, all of which are coin only loot.<P><BR>Oh and for changes to pvp? give monks the ability to stun with their attacks, and give them seom hard to get very high resist/low weight with decent AC armor that is no drop, that they have to quest for if necessary, there is a great dearth of resist gear for monks out there which realy hurts them in pvp.  Do these two things and you will lift monks up off the bottom rung of the pvp ladder, and give them a fighting chance to survive.<P>And fix bards as far as keeping the selos ICON up when they are rooted. Sure, they get rooted as the recent pach intended. But now bards unlike all other classes (who get to keep their sow /jboot icons on UNDER the root, when it wears off they still have their speed effect) now BARDS alone, have NO SPEED EFFECT on when the root breaks and they have to start up selos again while getting group ganked...when they could be using that time to sing a resist song etc.<P>So give bards what all the other classes have, sure let them be rooted while selo'sed , but have the selos icon STAY UP while they are rooted so when root drops they are still selos'ed.  Possible? I hope so.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Thank you for the thread. If you are still reading, I promise you some fresh complaints/ideas!<P>First, I wanted you to know I started here a couple days ago a thread about the worst exploit we have on the teams server. <BR>If you wish to read it, it has over 100+ posts, as the issue is dear to many of us.<P>it is located at:<BR>http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058546.html<P>Basic synopsis? It asks for the Teams to be HARDCODED so you cannot heal the other teams.<P>Please address this! I cannot defeat an enemy who has an invulnerable healer (becuase the healer is on my team)!! <P>Let me add that FACTION hits is not the fix to this problem! the Crossteaming guilds do not use most towns anyway, as they are KOS there. They instead use Velious towns or twinks to bank with. Thus faction hits will not solve the problem!<P>Other issues<P>2) Uber-guards I understand their need, to insure newbies have someone still there to kill the bat about to finish them. Problem is that they get trained onto raiding parties , to zone lines, and the like, making Invasions near any town an experience loss event.<P>I propose you keep them uber, hell invulnerable.. but you root them to their post. They can still aid by killing the bat on the newbie running to them, but they cant be trained to the war party nearby. <P>3) Deleveling. please make it so you lose all stat/skill advances with level loss. It is not fair to have the uber level 8's with last names and level 30+ backstabing ability.<P>4) Hill bug. the ghosting and havoc this causes in tracking can be fixed I have been told. Please help me chase the fleeing casters who exploit this flaw on purpose!<P>5) Out of range invulnerability. There is a problem where an extremely high level healer/buffer will follow a low level player around, healing them and giving them uber buffs, which cuase the low level player to be almost invincible. Because of the healer./buffer's high level, there is very few ways for the low level combatants to stop the aid from being given.<P>solution? make it so that buffs can only be cast on players also withing 8 spell levels. With this, there is a greater likelyhood that some of the combatants are also in rage of the healer/buffer, or it increases the likelyhood of them knowing someone who does.<P>This also limits the ability to Power level, which is a nice fix onto itself.<P>Again, thank you for reading these suggestions, and please look at the other fresh thread about the Same-team-invul-healing exploit at<BR>http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058546.html<P>Coraan Honorbound<BR>Pathfinder<BR>Tallon Zek<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>From the perspective of a level 57 enchanter on Tallon Zek:<P>GENERAL PVP PROBLEMS ON TEAM SERVERS<P>#1 IMMORTAL HEALING EXPLOITS:  This is where someone of your team heals your opponent.  You cannot prevent this because they are on the same team as you.  Guilds and groups of mulitple teams use this exploit all the time to drive people out of dungeons, that they would otherwise not be able to defeat in "fair" PvP combat.  I have seen inferior forces destroy much more powerful groups many times because they were using this exploit.  This kind of skewed PvP is no fun.  Verent really should fix this.  <P>An almost perfect solution would be to make it so that for a short period after taking damage from or being cast upon by another player you cannot be the recipiant of any beneficial spells from anyone on an opposing team.  This fix would still allow for cross-team grouping and guilds, but would prevent people from using it to gain an unfair PvP advantage.<P>#2 PUMICE - I think the pumice nerf is great.  I play an enchanter, and before the pumice nerf, on those occasions when I could actually get one of my magical debuffs to stick to an opponent it would get dispelled immediately.  Buffs were useless too.  Every battle began with both opponents dispelling all of each others buffs.  Enchanters get an improved line of nullify magic spells: strip enchantment/pillage enchantment/recant magic.  Before the pumice nerf all of these spells were inferiro to egg-shaped pumice.  Now there is actually an advantage to possesing these spells.<P>#3 Deleveling - a lot of people are deleveling high level rogues and warriors now-a-days.  These deleveled characters are monsters in PvP because they still have their high level melee skills.  Make it so that when you lose a level on a PvP server you lose all level-dependant skill points that are above what your current level cap is.  Don't punish the act of deleveling itself.  (I have heard of people getting warnings for de-leveling.)  There is a perfectly legetimate reason to delevel.  People delevel themselves through the necromancer sacrifice spell in order to obtain essence emeralds.  If someone wants a bunch of essence emeralds they shouldn't be punished for letting their necro friend delevel them for a few levels worth of essence emeralds.<P>#4 8 LEVEL LIMIT - only lowbies complain about this being too wide of a limit.  Once you get to around level 50, with nearly unresistable spells, high melee damage output, etc... it is quite possible to defeat someone who is 8 levels higher than you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Thanks for the attention Absor, this is from a Vallon Zek perspective:<P>1) Top issue, hands down, is immortal healing/damage shielding.  There are two kinds. The first is a person from your own "team" healing your enemy.  You have absolutely NO way to combat that if you play in a pure team guild.  The second version is out of range (oor) healing.  This makes some sense in a roleplaying aspect (elves sticking up for elves), but ONE high level damage shield is all it takes to win a fight.  ONE high level healer is all it takes to make a lower level character as immune to attack as a god.<P>Pumice needs to be brought back to the way it used to be.  You try to pumice off an enemy's high level fire shield while being beaten to a pulp.  The pumice charge will always be interupted.<P>2) Faction hits: Every single person who adds to the results of a battle should take a faction hit upon death of the victim...just like it is on the blue servers.  If I'm fighting an elf, and a someone from my human team heals that elf, if I die, that human should also take a human faction hit.  That includes someone who just runs by and gives you a backstab for the heck of it.  It makes no sense that only the person who makes the killing blow gets a faction hit.  &lt;---this could obviously be tied into immortal/oor healing.<P>Also regarding faction:  It's possible for hybrid and caster classes to avoid the faction hit by laying a small dot on a victim just as he falls down.  If the victim bleeds to death, faction loss is avoided.  Melee classes do not have that option.  The above solution to faction hits would solve this as well.<P>SKs and Paladins:  You've just fixed the SK deathtouch issue (kudos), but Paladins are just as deadly in that respect.  If a paladin respawns you have to kill him twice yet again.  That's just as bad for a half-health melee as an SK coming back with harmtouch ready.<P>I personally wouldn't mind seeing item loot come back to Vallon...it'd weed out some of the cry babies we have since you made the change to coin only.<P>Either fix immortal healing/damage shielding or change the server to good vs. evil please.<P>Thank you for your attention.<P>Morvran</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>A separate message dealing with enchanter and cleric specific issues from the perspective of a level 57 enchanter on Tallon Zek:<P>ENCHANTER AND CLERIC SPECIFIC ISSUES:<P>In the old days before coin-only loot, both of these classes could PvP fairly effectively.  After coin-only loot it became feasable to raise resistances because you no longer had to worry about losing your expensive resist gear.  This wouldn't be a problem except for 2 issues:  <P>(1) All spells that enchanters get are magic based and "all-or-nothing" in nature.  This means that if they are resisted at all, then you get no effect.<P>(2) It seems like many magic based spells are more resistable than other typses of spells.<P>The result of this is that anyone with much over 100 magic resist is IMMUNE to enchanters and clerics.  Most players over level 50 have significantly more then 100 magic resist.  I am a member of guild where the average member is around level 55, and almost all of us have around 150 MR with many of us who are close to 200.  High MR is not an atypical special case as Abashi once put it.  It is the norm on Tallon Zek.  This is because 3 classes of magic based spells are devistating: blinds, roots, and snares.  People hate these spells so much that as soon as they can, they raise their magic resist until they no longer have to worry about those spells affecting them.  The side effect is that this makes them completely immune to all cleric and enchanter spells as well.  In adiditon MR is one of the easiest resistances to raise with gear.<P>In every battle I am in, I begin with casting my highest level tashan line of spell, then I strip enchantments at least once (often 2 or 3 times) to remove any buffs that might give my opponent magic resist, and yet even after doing this the vast majority of the time that I cast my mez spells they are resisted.  My Dazzle spell (level 49 enchanter mez) is resisted better than 75% of the time and that is a pretty conservative estimate, I think it is actually more like 90%.  Many battles I've been in have gone exactly like this:<P>I cast tashania, then strip enchantment, then I go oom casting dazzle over and over again on a blue-con target and get resisted every single time.<P>That is just plain not fair.  I think Abashi or someone said that "some class has to be the worst pker", and that may be true, but when you are completely innefective at PvP combat then the game just becomes no fun on PvP servers.  If a class is no-fun then people stop playing that class.  There is much evidence that this is happening on Tallon Zek.  There is a serious shortage of high level enchanters on Tallon Zek.  Before the server went coin-only we used to be a very common class.  I am not as "in-tune" with clerics' situation since I don't play one, but they too seem very scarce at high levels, and I hear the clerics I group with complain about how much they suck at PvP because of resistances.  This is a problem because enchanters and clerics are essential for the high level PvE game, so all players on PvP servers suffer when people quit playing enchanters and clerics.  Verant needs to do something to make PvP more fun for enchanters and clerics so that more people will play these very neccessary classes.<P>I can't really comment on how to make it better for clerics since I don't play one, but here are some good suggestions for how to fix enchanters:<P>(1) Make the tashan line of spells more effective in PvP combat.  These spells should reduce magic resistances at least twice as much as they do.  Even with that, people with good Magic resist (over 100) will still resist magic based spells quite a bit. (I bet it would still be over 50% of the time though)  I think this would at least give enchanters a chance at landing some of their spells on a regular basis.  I think this would be the most balenced and fair way to increase enchanters PvP effectiveness.  They would still have trouble killing most people solo, but at least they would not be the "sitting ducks" that they are now.  They would also still be hindered by in PvP by having to first casting a debuff before casting any of their real offensive spells.<P>(2) Make enchanter Mezzes less resistable in PvP.  As I said before mez rarely sticks in PvP.  <P>Although getting mezzed is very frustrating it is not a particularily devistating spell if you consider what we are up against.  After level 50, most of our casting opponents can kill us with one spell.  Those that can't can do it in 2 or 3 very fast casting spells.  Most melees can kill us in a very short time through melee damage.  I think it would be balenced and fair for enchanters, who have very little damage dealing ability in PvP, to at least have a way to prevent the devestating damage that opponents can do to them in just one spell, or a few rounds of melee combat.  <P>In addition, there are exploits that enchanters' opponents use to prevent themselves from being mezzed.  Opponents who fear getting mezzed often cast low-level poison or disease based dots on themselves (enchanters have no way of removing such a DoT spell from their opponents).  The small amount of damge these spells do breaks the mez very quickly.  Opponents will often have members of their groups hit them to break mezzes as well.  This happens alot, so on top of hardly ever being able to land a mez do to resistances, the mez is often made completely or nearly innefective do to exploits.<P>In the PvE game enchanters primarily act in the capacity as crowd control.  It makes logical sense that this would be our roll in PvP as well.  But right now we cannot do that because our mezzes are too easily resisted.<P>(3) Make enchanter Nuke's less resistable.  Enchanter nukes are the weakest nukes of all classes.  Not only do they not do much damage, but they have a long cast time... &gt;6 seconds.  And a long recast time.  The recast time seems to be longer then 6 seconds as well.  So not only do our spells not do much damage, but they also cannot be cast that often in a period of time.  Our Direct damage spells are also not very mana efficient as well.  They do have an instant stun associated with them, which interupts opponent casting, but doesn't actually leave the player stunned for any period of time.  In addition our direct damage spells are "all-or-nothing" spells.  They either hit or they don't, with no chance for a partial resist.  In practice our direct damage spells are almost always resisted in PvP combat.  I have heard that enchanter nukes have a double save against magic check, do to the stun component of the spell, and this is the reason they are so highly resisted.<P>Does it really make sense for one of the weakest, most least damaging spells to be also the easiest to resist?  Once some friends did a test.  One guy buffed up his Cold resist to 140, and had a wizard cast ice-comet as a cleric healed him.  Ice-comet seemed to be doing about half as much damage as it normally does on average (which means a wizard can still do a hefty amount of damage even when faced with high resists)  With 140 Magic resist, an enchanter will almost never be able to do any damage to you at all.  Contrast that with a necro or druid, no matter how much magic resist you have, 95% of the time they will be able to cast splurt or winged death on you.  I don't think these classes need to be nerfed.  I just think enchanters needs some way to be able to hit back in some capacity.<P>BTW, I believe almost everything I've discussed in regards to enchanter DD spells also applies to cleric DD spells, but since I've never played a cleric I can't really speak with much authority on the matter.<P>Of the 3 remedies I suggested for enchanter PvP I and most enchanters I talk to think the first solution (increasing the effectiveness of the Tashan line of spells) is the fairest, simplets and best solution, but the other 2 would be nice as well.  Whatever you do, you need to do something to make it fun for clerics and enchanters on PvP servers, so more people will choose to play these 2 essential classes on PvP servers.  They are quite scarce now.  Just checking the usage logs of high level enchanters on Tallon Zek won't give you an accurate picture of how bad the problem is.  This is because many of the high level enchanters on Tallon Zek have basically quit playing their enchanters (I know this for a fact) but share the account loggin info with their guildmates.  Most of the time the enchanter is on he/she is being played by guildmates who need an enchanter for a PvE dungeon raid.<P>Anono<BR>Level 57 Enchanter<BR>Tallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sorry, one more issue:<P>It appears that killing helf-elves brings down human guard faction in Qeynos (possibly Freeport as well).  This cannot be.  They are set up on another team, and I should not become KOS in my own city because I kill the other team.<P>This has not been completely verified, but I play in a very aggressive single-team guild.  We kill more elves before sunrise than most others will kill in a year.  We held a guild meeting in Qeynos only to find that half of us were kos (where we'd been amiable or better just months earlier).

</FONT><HR>Since the issue of hardcoding the server is split between all the players on the Teams servers, I suggest leaving it as is.  Changing it, imo, will upset FAR more people then leaving it as is.  If you hardcode the servers, you'll be destroying a history that has been built for well over a year and a half, and will be drastically forcing an entire server into a new way of play.  I was under the impression Verant was against changes like this.  <P>However, if you were going to change something about the 'teams', why not make the Guilds on the Teams servers their own team?  Is it that hard?  Unguilded people could stay on their respective 'racial' team, while those that join a guild swear their alligence to that particular guild, and are therefore on that guilds 'team'.  Understand what I'm saying here?  That's pretty much how it operates on the team servers anyway.  Everyone is out for the superiority of their guild, and their guilds allies, teams be damned.<P>Let's talk about something that all the people on the teams servers can agree to.  Faction hits bite, and are far too powerful then they should be.  And the fact that there are faction htis for guildwars completely defeats the purpose.  What if I wanted to war with a guild that had humans in it?  If I killed anyone, myself, being a human, would severely kill my faction with my own race!  Does that make sense?<P>Please remove faction hits for duels and guildwars, hell, faction hits for PvP in general are stupid.  If there's a dwarf that's running around killing people, and even the players that play dwarves hate him, why should I lose faction with ALL dwarves for killing him?<P>Give enchanters back charm and fear!  They've been nerfed to high hell through the process of changes in PvP, give them something back.<P>Thou I'll admit, leaving it as is wouldn't upset me much.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
