</FONT><HR>"We even have people in many of the well-known 'uberguilds', and let me tell you, I really wish sometimes I could let you know who they were -- it might be a big surprise"<P>Aradune, I have a question then.  Why did it take so long to figure out that most of your uber velious mobs are basically impossible without a bunch of clerics and donals bp's?<P>Is it simply that your teams never tested these mobs in real battles?<P>I was in Velious beta and the ONLY semi-uber mob we ever attempted (to my knowledge) was that lv66 spider in DN with 66,666hp.  The ONLY way we could kill it was with me chaining my BP on a tank along with the GM's click healing other people, and he is easy as hell comparred to Dain, Yelinak, Velketor etc.<P>Let me just say this, if you nerf the donals bp you guys better tune down these mobs.<P>Just think about this logically.<P>Velious came out. What did players gain? A few new spells, not *that* helpfull.. No new levels.. Some new weapons sure, but nothing that extrodanary.<P>So... Lets say that pre-Velious, a mob like Trakanon was on a 1.0 scale to kill.<P>After Velious, you have mobs with 5x (some much more) the hp of before, plus damage output that is double to quadruple the ammount of trak.<P>HP factor - 5x (average number I'd guess)<BR>DMG output factor - 2x (average number I'd guess)<P>Do you realize that is 10x as hard as Trakanon when the players are giving NOTHING knew to work with?<P>I'm not even considering the factor that since the battles can be SO long you lose people and have to fight with less for a longer period of time, that is a big factor as well.<P>I'm not asking for you to say you guys made a mistake, you already said that.<P>But do you realzie what I'm saying? You made uber mob encounters like 10x harder give or take some and the players gained practically nothing.  I was looking forward to challenges when Velious came out.. But realistically, you need guilds with 100+ people to kill this crap.<P><BR>In short, when you are making changes to these mobs, consider that only a few guilds have 100+ peopel to work with, cleric bp is now worthless for epic encounters, player power hardly went up with Velious, and yes, we want a challenge, but a REALISITC challenge that ~30-40 people can do.<P>I'm done rambling =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Starting around 10a, hitting the local sub shop for subs or pizza, then playing til dinner.  Go home, eat dinner, go back to friends to finish playing til late night. Game balancing was when the adventurers were getting slaughtered and even though you rolled a hit for the monster, you'd say "mob X misses and misses".  LOL, they couldn't see cause you were rolling behind the good 'ol DM's screen  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Now the DM's screen is called a patch with stealth and normal nerfs.

</FONT><HR>I'll throw in my own request here:<BR> <BR>Well done with the nerfing of the Donal's BP. Finish the job by making Cheal work the same way and reducing the mega-damage Velious mobs and especially ubermobs are doing to tanks. Shamans and druids feel useless at this level. They can't heal well enough to even start to keep up and most of their spells bounce off or are absorbed by a massive HP total.<BR> <BR>Clerics shouldn't have to do nothing but heal constantly. Give mobs some of the advantages but not all the ones Velious allows. EVERY mob should have distinctive weak spots. Ice based creatures should burn nicely. PoG trees should suck vs. Defoliate. And so on. Giving most mobs in Velious broad-spectrum resists combined with megadamage attacks is what's killing the game(a problem Kunark has to a lesser degree).<BR> <BR>Revert CHeal to what it should have been-a spell that cuts downtime. Leaving it as an unremovable/dispellable buff is perfect,IMHO. One Cheal every 10 or so minutes.<BR> <BR>Then,consider how mobs must act when their opponent isn't getting Chealed but lesser spells instead. Gauge them based on this.<BR> <BR>And remember,we hybrids would like a way to help out here too. <BR> <BR>Thanks.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Great idea, if we don't have Complete heal, then we can cast, what, 8 Divine Lights at 350 mana apeace. Each one healing a fraction under 1000 hp<P>So, at full mana, a cleric can heal around 7500 points of damage before going OOM. Call it 1 1/2 Trolls. Oh, and it'll take at least 36 seconds to heal that mana. Not to mention it's one of our Fizzalot spells. <P>Our 59th heal, Celestial Elixier is not a valid heal, because for the first 11 seconds it heals a grand total of 400 hp. Sure, it's fine on Warriors, but on Hybrids it's cutting it *way* to fine in epic fights.<P>Think about that next time you get the great idea of throwing Complete Heal away. The game is so tied into this spell, that you would have to be insane to modify it and still expect the game to play remotely like it does today.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"I submit, however, when considering the big picture and the game as a whole, it's better that we try this stuff than not."<P>Agreed completely.<P>However, with all due respect I think the playerbase has a certain degree of understandable frustration - particularly when a problem so patently obvious seems to go ignored or brushed off for such a long time. The potential ramifications for the donal's bp were clearly out there.<P>Regarding your comment about removing the hp cap. In general the Velious "uber mobs" are so nasty that they completely shake the foundations of class balance. The minimum requirement to deal with such monsters are the optimum healers and tanks - specifically clerics with CH and fully buffed warriors using /disc defensive.<P>Setting the bar so high unbalances other classes because by design, the extra diversification of the classes from 50-60 ensured a much wider gap between first and second tier classes. Either the bar must be set low enough that more classes can be effective, or the classes need to balanced so the gap between the best and the second-tier classes will be very narrow.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well I'm in an "uber-guild"  on the same server as Tuuuuuuaaaan or what ever his handle is &lt;grin&gt;. % mobs is sorta ridiculous since I can easily count many more than 5 mobs which we have tried and had our clock cleaned without any hope for victory without extreme luck. Yes Trakanon is a "wuss" at this stage of the game we've gotten him down to usually a victory with no losses. Occasionally few will go down but that's due to getting ported to the shroom maze or cleric missing a heal or whatever. For most of the mobs the bps are barely used; however in velious I can think of some obscene mobs which could have had a small chance of success before the first donal's nerf even less success after the first nerf and would be impossible with any further nerfs.<P>King Tormax, Deraktor the Vindicator, Sontalak, the Dragon guarding the Plane of Misery, Velkator the Sorcerer (we killed him too) and many of the other 600+ quad mobs are quite difficult to kill without the donal's bp. Sure we've killed almost every mob in the game but we had to make a few attempts to garner a strategy in order to kill the mobs and often times there is a great deal of luck involved. Raids can be won or lost of on one or two heals because they turn the tide of battle. This is especially true with some the mobs I mentioned especially those which haven't been killed in a "legitimate" fashion. (i.e giving the mobs shields or 2hb etc) This is merely a reaction  to a mobs difficulty due to player restriction. I mean come on you have Deraktor the Vindicator who quads for 850 pts of damage guarded by two guards virtually unsplittable except with some good fortune. His guards hit hardf and fast for 425 a pop i think. The main mob himself can kill most players within a matter of seconds or even one melee round. Yes ther are tactics to fend off his attacks but there isn't enough mana to support absorbing 3800 pts of damage in 4 seconds and you can only run so many people in raid before lag is so awful that it is too hard to cast an accurate heal. Maybe clerics can get 9 cheals before going oom maybe less. With 7 clerics that's 63 cheals before going oom. <P><BR>As for balance well the end game has broken down into clerics warriors and rogues. Monks don't do enough damage or absorb enough to justify their presence over a rogue or warrior and the monks can taunt fairly well regardless. Rangers are good for Call of the predator and that's it. Pallys are good for divine str and da as well as loh. Sk's can blow their ht and they are gonna go down quick. Druids can land a paucity of spells and their heal is insignificant. Shamans buff like mad adds needed buffs but then as soon as they cast malo the mob eats them. I've never heard of a necro spell landing on any big mob with any frequency. Wizard lures actually do work and enchies buff us then try to debuff/tash and are eaten as soon as the mob gets hit with the debuff. So the warriors and clerics end up trying to hold out with the rest of the melee while the casters blow their load and become useless after they oom or they die quickly due to their fragility. <P>I dunno this is what actually happens when raids are done yeah I'm a monk and I'm usually one of the last to fall and I'm one of the lower levels at 57. <P>I'm not suggesting radical changes but something to increase the viability of classes which the value is primarily buffing<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>LONG post and at 5am. ACK!<P>"Heck, we're already talking about some major additions to gameplay (not just new content) that we're going to make after we make a serious stab at getting the classes balanced in the next few months."<P>Anytime you mention the word balance the ONLY thing players think of is NERF COMING!<P>New content? ***!!!! You need to fix the old content first. Notice the wording.. FIX not NERF. A whole lotta difference there and I am not just talking about the spelling.<P>"We even have people in many of the well-known 'uberguilds', and let me tell you, I really wish sometimes I could let you know who they were -- it might be a big surprise "<P>Umm.. I thought that Vermon employees were not supposed to be in player guilds????????? And what a shocker!!!! They are in "Ubber guilds." And to think... All of those guilds without Vermons people that thought they may have a fair shot at things. Oh, and don't give me any lip about only the GM characters or whatever being the ones not to be in guilds. GM, Alt, whatever. nobody would believe for a second that they wouldn't at some point use their pull to help their "ubber guild l33t budz" out...<P>"Undoubtedly, we'll have to make more adjustments, bringing the game back closer to balance. Some of these changes will probably be negatively perceived by some players, and hopefully others will be positively perceived."<P>I am all for class balance. Making all classes look interesting to play is a good thing. But from my viewpoint you have nerfed the F**king hell out of most classes while making a couple of classes all powerful and now you have to raise the power of the classes you obliterated to where they were ages ago and expect them to be happy they were brought back to older standards of power.<P><BR>"long term happiness to our playerbase"<P>***! Are you guys on crack or something? MOST people that I know are NOT happy with the game. They are only here because there isn't anything out at the moment worth playing.<P><BR>"These include this breastplate, the manastone, mistwalker, etc. And yes, unfortunately, these also caused unforeseen consequences."<P>Yeah.. Things YOU made and YOU tested and felt were worth adding to the game. Then all of a sudden OOPS!!!!!!!!!! Damn, sorry we gotta take it back from you or make nearly worthless. As for that whole manastone thing.. Overall the manastone isn't a very good item. I can see disabeling it in the planes, dungeons (eh, possibly) but other areas it should still be able to be used IMO. As for the breastplate. Hell, with their epic they get manaless rez's. They can sit for hours and hours and hours and hours just rezing for cash and never have to stop so hell, why not free heals as well. Clerics from what I have seen has got to be one of the most boring classes in the game. Gameplay of a cleric--- Stand, heal, sit, med, repeat. YAWN!<P>"I guess what I'm trying to say, or do, is manage expectations better, going forward. Perhaps another MMORPG will come along that never nerfs, never makes mistakes, but still evolves and expands, with a perfect dev and testing team, eager to try new things, but somehow impervious to failure"<P>It is the way you go about it that makes it so bad. You go out of your way to weaken the players instead of fixing probelms in the game. KNOWN problems that have existed for months and months and months but you are johnny on the spot when it comes to nerfing classes. THAT is probably what people are most irritated about. IMO if you spent a while and concentrate on actual problems in the game and start getting them fixed then I believe that the people would be a bit more happy. <P>" with a strong commitment to continue to both improve EQ and also expand EQ, be it with more content, more options, improved technology, etc."<P>More options, Yes. Improved technology, Yes. More content????? MOST zones aren't used or are hardly used as it is. Just do like you did with Paw. It is still under used but for those midlevel that are willing to go in deep it is a good zone for exp and some loot in there is pretty good.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Its basically all I do when online, seen 25 Trakanons go down etc etc.<P>Making Donals BP that useful was just, well, retarded. On those 25 kills I've been on 2 Donals BPs have dropped. On the 10 or so other kills the guild has done without me, one more has dropped. 35 Trakanons and 3 Donals BPs. I know atleast Legacy of Steel had this same problem as well. Some other guilds really lucked out (LoD being the prime example) with Donals BPs for their twinks.<P>There is one huge problem which you didn't even bother commenting on... What people call the "uberguild problem" is pretty much a result of this. We have like 4 Singing Steel BPs sitting in banks, yet went back for Donals BPs, effectively preventing other guilds from trying Trakanon? Why? Because we want to twink with bard BPs? Nope... because you just admitted some encounters were designed with these BPs in mind so we were FORCED to go back to collect Singing Steel, Tolans and whatever for our bank.<P>I admit this nerf is something that had to be done, but what you're describing is such a rude slap in the face for the clerics (and guilds) that have worked their asses off to get these items. The BP would quite effectively be useless.<P>Some ideas of what to do with it:<BR>1. Make effect Divine Light with 15.0 casting time.. it'd still be extremely useful for a lot of stuff, but for epic encounters a 900hp heal is just too little to make a difference.<BR>2. Manaconvert might be good, but that is already in Sacrifice (off Yelinak), which you btw NEED TO MAKE RIGHT CLICKABLE, its damn substandard atm just acting as a primary hand shield (I've done some logging, meleeing with it is not justified).<BR>3. A new line of hp buffs. Maybe the line that the rangers hp/atk buff is, but with 400hp and 1atk... Would be nice enough certainly, but without being overly powerful, and give a quite significant edge to the people with these BPs. (and NO, do NOT put in stupid reagent requirements).<P>-- Delheur Tanreall<BR>Avatars of Discord, Rodcet Nife<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think you should just completely scrap the current version of the Donal's BP, go back to the drawing board and come up with something new. Quite frankly this whole idea is flawed from it's very roots. Anything you'd do to try to balence it further would just increase it's silliness and quite probably uselessness.<P>My own recomendation? Send this back to the item design team, tell them to make a cleric item with a right-click that is "useful in most fights, both grouping and raiding" and see what they come up with, but dont tell them they're looking for a replacement to the Donal's BP effect. There's a point where you need to sweap the slate clean and start over fresh, i think we're there. Any nerf using the same ideas as the original from this point out will just make people mad and unable to appreciate the usefulness it still has.<P>Also, dont tell people what is useful, ask them.<P>Fizzi<BR>High Priest of Innoruuk, E'Ci</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

How...well in short, the view that celrics only heal, and chanters buff otehrs and mez...both hae all spells on one set of saves MR...long view easier to control. Short view, makes them useless as offensive tools later in game further reducing their efficiency.<BR> This means that other classes are affected too...specials should be considered no stun no mez, but in every legendary epic battle every monster, every dragon had its weak spot. All mobs should have an achilles heal...just move it around a bit...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well it seems as if you have already made up your minds about this and there is nothing we can do. Certain people know exactly what triggered this as do the people in your dev team who are pushing for this nerf. I will say again, dont blame the short commings of a zone on an item. If you would like to know exactly why a zone or mob is so easy email me, but I cant think of zone mob where the donalds BP makes that mob extremly easy. The main use of the BP is to heal shamans who are buffing 30 people in guild raids. Nerfing the BP will only result in more downtime and less fun. <P>List a in real game situation that would make the bp overpoweing. By that I mean list a mob name and how it can be used to make it justify its nerf. <P>Elderan Lotuswood<BR>elderanlotuswood@yahoo.com</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I honestly don't think that players want you to stop adding content or trying new things.  However, I do believe that they just wish to hell you'd test things with much more efficiency and do so very very thoroughly.  Think about the potential uses/types of uses/player impact an items/zones/quests etc might see or have.  Then perhaps you wouldn't have the problems you have now like this breastplate for one, the lack of some Velious armor graphics for two, the sudden uselessness of caster classes during combat in Velious for a third, and I could go on and on but I won't.<P>"But, honestly and bluntly, the short-term happiness or disappointment is secondary in our decision making process."<P>Short-term... isn't that one of your major problems though?  You add content without looking into the long-term affects then have to go back and correct your mistakes... mistakes that you probably would have ferreted out if you'd just done a more thorough job of testing?  Just look at the problems on the bug board.<P>EQ is a great game with way to many unnecessary flaws and bugs.  Maybe you guys need to slow down a little bit and start doing a lot more thorough testing, definitely start thinking things through towards the big picture that deals with the long-term and not the short-term lets get this into the patch now that you appear to work in now.<P>Just my thoughts<P>Morgian<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Think about it.<P>Add a 7th to cast remedies and heal clerics for the messy real world.  <P>---<P>I think in general you overlook the value of charges on items.  If you have a robe with an effect and a 100 charge limit which can be recharged for plat then you have a money sink.<P>Having rechargable charges on items would allow you to create different varieties of the same item.

A "medium" one with 6, a "good" one with 30, and the "uber" one with 36.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Greetings,<P>Just want to put in a few comments. I would agree that the Donal's BP having Complete heal was too powerful. It was blatantly obvious to me from day one but since it wasn't a bug I wouldn't complain about it. Like you've stated, The BP is essentially inifinate damage when channeled through a melee class. I seriously doubt a single warrior and cleric could kill a Kunark or Velious dragon but then put several together and you have problems. Anyway, getting to the point, why not change the spell to a different heal spell such as celestial elixir or divine light or a new spell that does a large amount of heal but not complete heal. The fact that it's manaless healing is still on the overpowered side, but you opened pandoras box by making items that can heal/dd without mana. I understand the need to unbreak the item because it causes a game imbalance, but don't break the item so that it isn't usefull either. I probably don't need to speak my mind since I probably will not get the chance to use this item but in the possiblilty that I might, I'd like it to be something worth trying to get.<P>Regards,<P>Edain.<BR>Tunare Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One last thought (sorry about the multiple posts..)<P>In designing uber encounters, I REALLY think you guys should sit down and say..<P>Okay- What is the ranger's role in this? and make something that needs a ranger.<BR>Okay- What's the enchanters role in this uber encounter? (Usually adding a few unsplitable but mezable mobs with the mobs)<BR>Okay- What's the Necros' role in this?<P>And so on.<BR>You seem to be acting like folks who have only gm'd a couple years and say, "I'm going ot make a bad ass encounter" and you make the encounter without considering the characters playing your game.  I've GM'd for over 25 years.  In designing my uber encounters, I look at each of the players in my game- and their magic items (including that growth potion they got six months ago) and design the encounter to where using every player and every tool will make it easier.  I can never require a particular item be present because by the time they get there they may have drunk the growth potion.<P>My advice to you is to consider your encounters in this way.<P>Decide how many players of what levels should be able o beat it and then give each one a role in the encounter.  And a note: SINGLE mob encounters never worked well in DnD unless they have a lot of abilities (so really they are a group wrapped up in one monster).  Either the mob is too tough or it is too weak.  Groups of mobs are always more interesting.<P>One possible "uber" encounter..<P>0) some mobs that can be snuck by with invisibility<BR>1) some splittable mobs that can be feign pulled out<BR>2) some unsplitable mobs that can be mezed<BR>3) some unsplitable mobs that cannot be mezed which do not have high MR.<BR>4) some unsplitable mobs which cannot be mezed that DO have high MR.<BR>5) the "boss" mob.<P>So you could have a throne room with the guards at the door pullable.<P>The courtiers would be a mixture (which could be told apart) of unsplittable mobs of types 3-4.<P>And a king or queen to be the boss mob.<P>---<P>Then you get tricky.  <BR>You make the King and Queen tough but not really the boss mobs- instead, the boss mob is the jester or the bishop.<P>Then trickier still- some traps in the throne room that can be disabled by rogues.<P>Layer complexity over the encounter.  Buffs on the mobs that can be dispelled.  Mobs that cast buffs during the battle so dispell continues to be needed.<P>Mobs that focus in on certain classes.<P>Mobs that strip enchantments or cast debuffs.<P>--<P>For now your uber encounter seems to be one big mob with a lot of hit points that hits hard.<P>That's just not very complicated.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>During the beta test of Velious, we were only able to kill a mob with 66k hps, via 2 or 3 GMs CHAIN casting lay on hands.  A cleric with a click stick was ressing the fallen heroes, and the rest of us were just bashing away at the spider.  We had three groups.<P>One person there even had a Donal's BP, and it cast just plain too slow to do much good.<P>Fact of the matter is, the testing that went on involved using tactics that are not usable in the real world, where paladins have to wait 72 minutes to lay hands again.<P>The testing was deficient, and now we're paying the price for it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If you feel that the BP needs to be changed, so be it, but can you please make it not take up a buff slot? <P>I know your average ranger and sk with half their Velious spells, a shaman and a cleric buffing them, have 14 or so buffs already. Dont make us waste a buff slot if you have another possible way of implementing the nerf.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A) This stinks. <P>Ok now that that is out of the way...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>B) Why not make the "buff" icon-less. don't overwrite anyothers that may be needed with the watered-down pathetic thing you will impose on the BP.<P>C) 7.5 min is FOREVER in any raid, I could see 2-4 min as reasonable. <P>D) How would the cleric KNOW the time was up on a particular player? With the recycle time if he misses by 1 second, that means he will need to wait an additional 30 seconds to re-cast. By which time the tank will most likely be dead. Joy Joy for you we know, but it will be a cause of grief to you when people start yelling about this.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The change to the effect is just sensible. But please revert the casting time.<P>While you are at it, could you make similar changes to the other healing effect Kunark armor ?<P>Right now Donal's arms are close to useless. 21 ac is nice, but a valor that takes the same time to cast as medding the equivalent amount of mana back is pretty useless. As it stands it's most suited for twinking a low lvl cleric. Actually I would much rather have effect water breathing like the bard gloves.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oh, and brad as to being seen in a negative light. You guys just once might want to "fix" bugs you introduce as fast as you "fix" exploits. This is correctly seen as scorn for your customers. The bard drum is a good example, one you were warned of by bards on test for at least a week. You KNEW it was going in, you KNEW how to fix it, yet it was shoved to the "back of the book". How else should people see it?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052944-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052944.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052944-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052944-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052944-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052944-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052944&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052944&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
