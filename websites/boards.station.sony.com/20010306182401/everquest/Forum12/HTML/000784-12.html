</FONT><HR>To anyone saying that giving Wizards a nuke that does incredible damage is a bad idea:<P>Do you honestly think we're going to be chain nuking with a 5k damage spell?  No way!  High level Wizards know that you use your biggest nuke at the end of the fight to kill the mob which doesn't aggro the mob on you unless you gt a partial resist.  It makes us more group friendly, because low health mobs are the ones that run/gate/complete heal.  I was supposed to be the master of offensive spell damage...show me the damage!<P>(On a side note, we all know that Verant can add agro reduction code to the nuke if they so desired, so they could reduce agro on the higher hitting nukes...IF they so desired.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Among the things a seeking knowledge class should get fixed are the levels of IR and especially UV vision.  I've pointed this out many times before, but Wizards get UV vision 10 levels later than any other caster class does.  Even BARDS get theirs at level 24, and our Chill Sight only works on us.<P>Sight spells are SPECIFICALLY mentioned in the description of the class, this seems a bit odd, to say the least.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ninaeve,<P>"8) Translocate should wipe the tank of all coin or have some negative effect..."<P>What kind of crazy talk is that?<P>Translocate is a GOOD spell for wizards.  I LIKE the spell as it is.  If it had a negative aspect added to it, I would feel EXTREMELY NERFED.  The usefulness is that if your group evacs from City of Mist, all casters can gate back, but not the tanks.  The wizard can Translocate all non-gating group memebers back, and others can gate themselves.  If this spell is changed, then I'm going to be irritated.  About the only change I would think about is to add a spell to take the group to OUR bind point.  Of course, Verant might see some random "balace" problem with that  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Quad kiting for druids and wizards is very different.  Druids snare lasts a LONG time.  Bonds of Force and Atol's does not.<P>The druid can easily snare them all separately with his single target, ultra long duration snare.  The wizard must aggro all four and do a single AE snare, because of the high manna cost.  Of course, if you make one mistake when pulling them together for the snare, you get quad hit by four mobs.  If you get stunned, you're dust.  If not, you might be anyways.<P>I have multi kiting pretty much as down as can be for a wizard.  I was able to pull quads off at the Spirocs for a level or two.  I died a few times there.  I finally have enough mana, through artificial enhancement gear and a high enough level to limit the resists, to do raptors.  But they're going green on me.<P>There is no place for a wizard to quad kite mobs for 6-8 levels like druids can.  We get a level or two.  Of course, if you're in an uber guild or something and can get 300 mana in equipment, you can probably get a couple or three more levels out of it.  For wizards, it's still exceptionally risky compared to druids.<P>Given the risk, effort and time (especially downtime) to do this, add in the fact that AE column type spells were really designed for this, why even consider nerfing it?  It's apparent that some mobs were placed specifically FOR this.<P>I can understand concern over the druid's excessive ability to do this, but not for the wizard.  My suggestion to bring the druids use of this within reason would be to drop the duration of their snare spell considerably.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;I’m listening. Make some suggestions. But there’s a caveat. Do it without turning the wizard into one of the other classes (I’ve seen requests for massive crowd control...).&lt;&lt;<P><BR>ARGH!!! Are you serious?  If you are then the whole game is out of whack right now.  Nearly every class that can cast a spell can cast a DD spell, and the ones that can't can get a weapon that does.  Do it without turning the wizard into one of the other classes?  What are you talking about that's the wizards biggest gripe.  If you take away DD from every other class I will be happy with my wizard no changes.  But the fact is they all have it, and quite a few of them come VERY close to us.  Now wait, here's the kicker ... they can do other stuff too! <P>Come on Alan, you know as well as I do that we can't give wizards bigger DDs it will create balance (PC vs. NPC balance) and PvP issues.  Ideally a unique group oriented ability would be perfect, that's why people used to bring up damage shieds (it made sense).  But we continually got told "no, that's mages territory."  You have no problem telling us "hey that's someone elses job,"  but when it comes to giving out DD you give it out to nearly EVERY class. <P>Look, wizards are broken.  Your stuck on this idea that "wizard just does damage" and your not willing to give us enough of a margin on the other classes to justify leaving out all of the spells they get.  The rogue wasn't meant to be a damage machine, but someone (give this guy a raise) in your office realized that the class wasn't viable in relation to the game if it stuck with the way you envisioned it.  The wizard is at the same crossroads.  Either give us a unique group ability, another viable existing group ability, or take DD away from every other class. <P><BR>Oh forget it, I'll just go start a druid.  They can nuke pretty well, evac like I do, DOT, Heal, Track, have higher AC, have higher hps, can melee better, have SOW, regen, damage shields....the list goes on Absor.  Just for a minute, look at how close other classes are to the wizard in his abilities, then look at everything else they get to do.  If you still think wizards are balanced, then I must be looking at it wrong.<P>SolRoWizard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>New Spell ideas to bring about balance-<P>Wizards should have a spell called Stasis.<P>It takes but a mere thought (.01 seconds) to cast and your group and all engaged mobs just kind of freeze, like time has completely stopped.  <P>The Wizard can then sit down and med for 15 minutes to rebuild his mana pool.<P>What do you think?<P>Wait, another idea popped into my head-<P>Its called Funds Transformation-  (2 second cast)<BR>Its does a /q and calls your bank to cancel your EQ account and diverts funds to -NEW GAME WITH WIZARD BALANCE-.<P><BR>These issues have been known, mainly since Kunark was released.  This is way too long in my opinion.  This quest has gone on too long without a resolution.<P>I would fully expect Wizards to rival the damage dished out by our counterparts, the Rogue in the very near future.  If not, then apparently my money is better spent elsewhere.<P>I swear whoever worked on the Wizard class in VI Development is incompetent.  Absolutely no vision or testing has been accomplished.  I know W is last on the list alphabetically, but is that a good excuse to not have things tested and thought out before implementation?<P>*frustration*<P>Triple mana regen, cut resists down by 50%, cut spell costs in half, implement proximity/percentage based spells and all the group issues will be taken care of as well.<P>Of all classes, the Wizards should be the easiest to fix!

</FONT><HR>One addition to the list:<P>Group buffs!<P>Wizards aren't wanted in groups because we can't buff others.  Please give us unique and useful buffs so people will want us again.<P><BR>Also, translocate allows us to gate a party member.  This rarely benefits the wizard and usually benefits the recipient considerably.  This spell is NOT easy to obtain, but is a basic utility type spell.  Please adjust the difficulty in obtaining this spell so that is worth the trouble.  I'd suggest putting it on the vendors in Thurgadin.<P>It's such a pain to get now, ppl are trying to charge up to 4k to sell the spell and melee classes are oocing like everyone has the spell.  Well, unless something's fixed, I'm going to charge 250plat for a translocate because of the high cost/pain to obtain the spell.  Since no one will pay that, it will be a worthless spell.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE<BR>PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE<BR>PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE<BR>PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE<BR>PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE<BR>PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE<P>1-) I'd like to be more group friendly w/out infringing on other class defining abilities.<BR>     IDEA:<BR>         Why not a spell that allows the weapons of the group to proc or glow with a certain type of damage spell for a certain duration.  That way the idea still stays in line with "MASTERS of DAMAGE" concept, the spell could either cost a certain amount of mana per person that gets the benefits of the spell, or the mana could be deducted over a period of time, forcing us to turn the spell off or end it so it doesn't continue to draw mana.  In this way it's not a buff but an actual damage spell that draws mana from us while in effect.  That's a new line I believe.  MANA BLEEDING BUFFS, OUR OWN MANA. ALL DAMAGE AT THE COST OF OUR MANA.<BR>         We could get different types of damage over different levels.  Fire at one level, ICE at another, Lightning at another.  Over time the amount of damage done by this spell would be increased either per level. Or different/better damage spells can be given at new levels.<BR>        <BR>2- When our group pulls DEEP REDS, I'm doomed to a life of low damage, or complete resistance.  I HATE this, I feel completely useless.  At least with the previous line of spells, I mentioned above, we could feel somewhat useful in these situations.  I know you are looking into ways of addressing this, but please know that this is a routine problem for all wizards.<P>3- When I burn, I burn with the knowledge that we were created to burn like no other, faster then any other, with the most damage dealt in that period of time.  This does hold true, in the 15 seconds it takes me to burn off a full mana bar. Unfourtunately, the fight takes 3 minutes to finish.  <BR>       TWO IDEAS ON THIS:<BR>  1) Please give me more mana/faster mana regen,  so that I can stay in the fight longer. Let me decide what and how to burn, and how fast. <BR>             ----- OR -----<BR>  2) <BR>     a) Please increase the amount of damage done by me so that I can live up to the "MASTER OF DIRECT DAMAGE" title that has been placed on my shoulders, when I clicked the WIZARD button on the character creation screen.        <BR>     b) PLEASE INCREASE MY HIT POINTS IF YOU DO THE ABOVE STEP. <P>        [I KNOW I KNOW NEW AND NOVEL IDEA]  <P>This might actually help the aggro problem that we receive when we nuke and nuke hard, w/out actually changing the AGGRO foundation of the game. The solution would be relatively easy to implement, since everyone already has higher health then a wizard.  We would actually LIVE LONGER in a fight when we trained something on us while performing our role appropriately, DAMAGING THE BAD GUYS.  It would give the time needed for the TANKS to yank them off, it would let us actually handle solo pulls if they got on top of us.  No more running around, GET IT OFF GET IF OFF [not that I do this, but I have seen others do it].  I'm not saying turn us into tanks for health.

</FONT><HR>Ok, I read on the Necro board that Absor believes in huge encounters that Necros giving mana to other classes (as their only job on a big raid) is what they do best and that's that.  That's disturbing.  I know if I was a necro I wouldn't want to go to a dragon/god encounter and say: Well, my job is to suck up their life and then give mana to the wizard who's resisted most of the time anyway.  <P><BR>I used to have an Enchanter, and one of the factors I quit playing (there were others, like addiction and being better for my health to quit  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  ) was that my Enchanter would go to a FG raid or Dragon raid and NOT be able to Crowd Control.  Now, we all know the stat debuffs do NOTHING (except for Slow spells, but Shaman's spells are better.)  So, other than a Tashania (if any class actually casts magic DDs on Gods/Dragons...I wouldn't as they have alot of resists as is being a Wizard).....and acting as buff-slut and SLTW and Rune and Clarity everyone.  Even though I was adding to the dmg significantly as an Enchanter w/ just those spells....who the HELL wants to sit there and watch others do your damage for you ?  I know Enchanters AREN'T DD based, but please...if I can't muck with it's mind, stun, or mez them...give me a "Special Encounter" DD spell line that is mana efficient and fast casting-- when monsters are flagged: No stun/mez/charm....then the "Special Encounter" line would work on them so Enchanters can add SOME damage.<P><BR>My point ?  Absor has misguided ideas on how higher end lvl casters want to be.  There's no way I wanna walk into a dragon/god encounter and add a laughable amount of dmg to it.  If you think balancing the dragon/god encounter by making casters resisted more and more will work....you are wrong....you'll just see more Rogues/Warriors/Clerics and tanks in general being twinked up and attending the raids.  When I was a lvl 1 Enchanter I heard of Vox and Nagafen...and I WANTED to lvl up so bad to be on these raids....now that i've come back and play casual...i'm not in a rush to get to 35+...because in my opinion that's when casters powers start to weaken and crumble.<P><BR>Casters are not going to be content having a minor role on Dragon/God encounters....we want to hold our own.  Maybe disable our utilities, like snare/root/charm/mez etc...but don't take away our damage.  If I was a necro, I wouldn't even go on raids to be a mana battery:  If the end encounter was figured in w/ a necro being a cleric's mana battery...and no necros show up, maybe something would change.  Now, I use Necros because I heard that reply about being a mana battery...my point w/ us wizards is that we don't want miniscule damage either...not acceptable when u watch melees go to town.<P><BR>Also, i'm backing up the idea that since Wizards have a lot more restrictions on their dmg (resistances, fizzles, AND oom) then our dmg should be GREATER than a rogue when we have our spells.  All casters should be STRONGER than the melees...why?  We give up armor and have to meditate for mana....where's the fairness in having tanking capabilities AND great offense....no utility spells?  HA, they don't work on Dragon/Gods.  The casters are so resricted in their dmg that they should do MORE than melee in the time they have mana, and not less.<P><BR>Krytal *knows this thread will explode b4 being split* </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here's the blasts I think we should have across most if not all level ranges starting at 20 or so, and why:<P>Fast low damage: Draught type spell, but not unusually efficient, can even be less efficient.  Just something exceptionally fast (1.5-2.0 seconds at most) and 30% or lower the present damage of the normal blasts that level.  Purpose is to give the WIzard superfast effect in an emergency to chain burn things or nail that runner, etc.<P>Slow HUGE damage: Gigantic blast for the level, 150-175% of the normal damage, but casts 50%-100% slower with poor mana cost.  Long recast time, such as 45 or more seconds.  Purpose: useful only for that last big boom to kill the creature while it goes nuts or tries to gate, or to get the runners.  Aggro would be large and uncontrollable, so its not useful in normal attacks and the long cast/recast time makes it not very useful soloing.<P>Low Resist blast: A Lure LIne all the way down to level 24 at least.  For situations like the EXG in Solusek A and various new creatures in Velious that are massively resistant.  For a class that relies directly on mana channeling into the target for combat effect, high resistances ruin Wizards uniquely.  This could also be used to offset the 6+ level resist cap that ruins Wizard grouping benefit.  A poor efficiency line of lower damage that ignores this cap would be a great asset.<P>Damage of 2-3 types per level.  I would prefer 3 per level, but 2 is probably the best we can expect.  This would allow us to better tune our type of damage against resistances.  THis is rarely an issue in the game, but does come up on occasion and unlike other classes we have no other recourse to fall back on (oh, blasts aren't working well, I'll just send in my pet).  Also would fix the hideous problem of level 20 having no reliable useful blast.<P>AE Spells better distributed and efficiency.  The efficiency and damage of the level 34 AE spells makes them a big hit, useful at their level and for quite a few beyond there.  Unfortunately, this is not representative of Wizard AE spells overall.  If the types and efficiency of AE spells were more smoothed and useful across all levels, then they would be more commonly used and groups would be more comfortable with their use.  These, too, could benefit from having multiple types of damage more often.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Maybe adding a mana transfer spell would make wizards wanted when fighting +32k hp mobs. Then they could at least top off the cleric if the group was fighting something that there was no point in sticking (or trying to stick) a dd on. Would be useful for giving mana to enchanters and shamans as well since they have buffing and debuffing duties.<P>Of course nacros can already do this better than wizards ever could and they don't want to. So if it's a success necros will start doing it and wizards will be out in the cold again or if it isn't a success it'll just be another spell-line to stick in the back to your book.<P>PS I'm a mage and even though my caster versatility is very limited I still feel that wizards are screwed. If they can't bomb the mob all they can hope is that the fight goes wrong so that they can at least evacuate. yay! /sarcasm off</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I'm thinking the "safe points" in all dungeons should be right at the zone-out point.

</FONT><HR>Here's another point I forgot:  Having damage greater than a Rogue, yes...but in one spell?  HELL NO !  That would be SO problematic.  If u make us the masters of efficiency in our mana, we can have spells that do that damage they do now (maybe up them by 20% as we ARE the masters of magicial damage)....and just allow us to cast MANY of these spells.  This way we can incrementally increase agro and not just plop a 10K damage spell in all at once.<P><BR>Also, i've been thinking of this too, ppl are saying melees have awesome weapons to gather and gear.  Well, I think it's time that a caster gets MEANINGFUL stat dropping items.  I always laughed when someone went to a Phingel raid and got a +100 mana robe.  I mean, yeah, they do stack up, but please.  100 mana ?  That won't even cast like a lvl 20 spell sometimes.  I always went for +CHA gear (being an Ex-enchanter) but that's the only stat that mattered to me until I could juggle +INT in there...after u meet the 200 INT and CHA....u don't really care about other stats.  And u can acquire 200 INT/CHA quite early if u really try.<P><BR>Now enter the melee/caster balance.  It's only fair to say, that melees got so powerful thru dropping armor and weapons in Kunark and Velious....so, I believe it's only fair to start dropping caster boosting items.  Faster casting items....less resistance items....more damage items....more mana efficiency items.  If u r loathe to give us natural abilities (though u should definitely improve us alot as is) then this might be the only solution.  I've heard of newbie twinks and newbie casters...the casters always have a set cost of mana per damage and meditate to get it back....the tanks have awesome items to help them survive longer and easier....my druid friend at lvl 14 got a Guardian Hammer:  22 dmg/ 43 Dly.....at lvl 14 his max went from 10 to doing 24 when he equipped the hammer....then at lvl 20 he went up to doing 41 dmg as his max ability to hit.  That's a HELLUVA lot for a druid.  Needless to say he was druid-tank for along time (still is.)  The same can be said for wizards and the like...if you twink a class...it can only balance out stuff to have items to give a caster to cut med rates...or what have u.  And this isn't only an argument for twinking...(I personally hate twinking, but it's an example that higher lvl melee items filter down and change the dynamic of lower lvls even).  Anyway, at higher lvls, casters will have something to look forward to...and they would be scaled up like a warrior/tank/etc...thru their items.  This way, if another expansion comes out, and it blows away the problems created w/ Velious, then new better items can drop in the new lands.<P><BR>If u scale it correctly (though I hate to admit this all really) a warrior on a raid with 2 FS 1hs swords and bronze armor (not scaled up from lower lvls) would be pathetic...but they'd still be able to contribute enuff.  The adding of FBSS (or whatever is the hot haste item 2day) and his new armor and stuff that has resistance on it or what have u...make the tank able to tank better.  I think it's time to start dropping EASILY attainable equivalent caster gear....don't make it impossible either, as Kunark was a melee paradise for weaponary.<P><BR>Krtyal.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>THIS IS NOT A CLASS ENVY POST<P>In all honesty, the best and easiest way to fix our grouping issues would be to do something that VI doesn't seem to want to do.<P>In order to fix the grouping issue, you'll need to 'blur' the class lines a bit.  Look, quite simply,  all those mana buffs that enchanters get should be shared.  Mana is the lifeblood of casters.  We're supposed to be the unequaled pure caster...the one against which all others should be measured.  I mean, what better way for a wizard to increase performance of his group than to do that WHICH WE SUPPOSEDLY are masters of....mana control and assistance for the group.<P>I also believe we should have AE stuns.  This will allow us to help the enchanter with his mezzing and will also encourage AE groups (something which would be well received by all wizards).<P>Damage shields are another thing that could very easily been seen as part of a wizard's arsenal.  I know it would blend Mage and wizard a bit; but, it would allow an already tank heavy group to take the wizard -- since they'll get the DS from him as well.<P>You want an easy, simple way to encourage grouping?  Give us breeze at 20, clarity at 35 and clarity II at 50.  Give us an AE stun at 8, 24, 39, and 52.  Give us an upgrade to O'Keils at 16, 28, 44, and 54.<P>That'll make a HUGE difference and won't affect soloing beyond allowing us to increase our mana regen with the breeze, clarity, and clarity 2 spells.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>    Thank you for your response and effort.  I would like to address your question of how to make Wizards more group friendly.  You are exactly on point with your notion that increasing damage output will do this.  However, the increase must be significant enough to act as an incentive for a group seeking out a Wizard specifically for this purpose rather than accepting a more generalist caster class which can provide other benefits as well as nuke.  The following is a list of ideas with an EXPLANATION AS TO HOW EACH WOULD MAKE WIZARDS MORE GROUP FRIENDLY WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR ROLE AS DAMAGE DEALERS:<P>1.  Increase Damage Output by up to 50% more than other casters at comparable level.<P>    This is necessary to make a Wizard more group friendly.  If Wizard spells are only marginally more damaging than other casters’ then there is no incentive for a group to take a Wizard over those other classes which can also offer other abilities such as buffs to the group.  I offer the concrete figure of 50% as a starting point for discussion.  The reason for this is to emphasize that 10% or 20% more damage than other casters is not enough of a difference from other casters to provide an incentive for a group to seek out Wizards rather than more versatile <P>2.  Mana Effeciency.and Stored Mana Benefits  <P>    Increased mana efficiency is necessary to make Wizards more group friendly.  Conceptually, time is the currency in a MMORPG.  Groups generally try to gather the members who will provide the greatest experience in the least amount of time ratio.  Wizards are perceived as undesirable because their mana dependency increases the downtime that a group has.  Increased downtime equals less experience and therefore Wizards are not as desirable as less mana dependent classes.  This is a bigger problem than other casters because of the difference of a stored mana benefit versus a mana burst.  For example, A druid casts a sow and it provides a benefit long after the druid has regenerated the mana it cost to cast it.  A mage casts a pet, and the pet is around after the mage has regenerated the mana it cost to cast it.  By additional example, an enchanter casts a clarity which provides a benefit long after the enchanter has regenerated the mana it cost to cast it.  For a wizard the benefit, damage, is an  instantaneous one shot benefit which is over the second it is cast.  There is no lasting effect.  In other words, there is no “stored mana benefit.”  Since Wizards do not have the ability to provide stored mana benefits, there mana rate of regeneration should be increased to compensate.  This will increase the incentive of groups to invite wizards.<P>3.  Decrease Resists and Remove/Modify Six Level Cap.<P>    Resists equal wasted mana, or damage a wizard is unable to provide.  This hits wizards particularly hard because they have nothing else to contribute to a group except their damage.  If groups knew that Wizards had a much greater chance of resists than other casters on DDs then this would increase the groups incentive to invite Wizards.  <P>The Six level cap is more situation specific and really concerns aggressive groups which like to pull a lot of yellows and reds.  However, these groups are common enough to at least consider either removing the cap or putting a higher spread such as 10 levels on it.  Doing so would increase the desirability of Wizards in this type of group because as it stands now, there is no incentive at all for a Wiz to be in this group.<P>4.  Critical Hits.<P>    This is a great idea that some people have though up and seems to make sense as Wizards are the magic counterparts of Warriors.  The key issue for this topic is:  Will it make Wizards more group friendly.  I think it would.  Criticals are rare, but in a couple of hours happen with enough frequency that their existence is appreciated by a group.  I think in a close situation, where a group is already fairly rounded and seeks a member, it may consider the wizard because of the possibility of a critical hit since it really could tip the tide of battle.  For this reason, I think critical DD hits could provide an incentive for groups to consider Wizards.<P>5.  On Screen Damage and how it relates to Group Friendliness.<P>    On screen damage  could go a long way towards making Wizards more desirable in a group.  Basically, if you increase wizard damage as I indicated in point #1 above and don’t show it, group members may not realize the benefit the wizard brings.  The expericed ones would, but lets not start with the assumption that all players are experienced in caster combat.  Many of the Melee players may not understand why the wizard is constantly sitting on his tuckhus.  If ALL caster damage is shown on screen then group members can observe that the wizard really is contributing his/her share to the fight.  Right now, all we see is the Melee damage which really emphasizes in our minds that it is the Melees who are doing the damage, not the casters.  If you show those big DD numbers on screen, it will show groups that Wizards are pulling their weight and, thus, increase the incentive for a group to invite a Wizard.<P>6.  Percentage DD<P>    This has been discussed by others and would increase the Wizards’ desirability against uber-mobs while not having a great misbalancing effect on weak mobs.  Thus, percentage DDs would increase the desirability of Wizards in groups who fight high hit point Mobs.<P>7.  AE Spells and Aggro <P>    As AE spells stand, they are very undesirable in a group.  This is for two reasons:  One:  They break the Mez and Two:  All the Mobs aggro on the Wizard and either kill him or annoy the group by forcing them to save the wizard.  While I don’t see a solution to the Mez problem, it seems that an AE spell centered on the tank which causes monsters to aggro the tank could be beneficial for certain types of groups.  In other words, those groups without chanters who have tanks and people to heal the tanks.  So, an AE spell with aggro on the Tank would increase a Wizard’s desirability in non-chanter groups.<P>    The above ideas would, I believe, increase the incentives for groups to invite wizards and thus would make wizards more group friendly.  Most importantly, the above ideas increase group friendliness while in the framework of the Wizard class:  Magical Damage Dealers.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My question is simply this, Ive spent almost 3 years now playing my wizard. I have always looked foward to getting higher in levels and dealing out more damage as I moved along. My question is, why is it that each level after 50 our spells do basically the same amount of damage from 50 to 59, Ok yes they are supposed to use less mana and be more efficient, but I feel this is still not enough. You mean i have to wait till level 60 to use sunstrike to deal out at least 1500 or more dmg in one strike. I think this is stupid. I am willing to bet this spell will be super reisist like the crappy Ice comet spell and its reissts. My point is this, we either need more of a mana reserve or an alternate method of recovering mana at a faster rate. Other method would be to at least give us some spells that hit harder for less mana used. Ice comet takes 400 mana and does 1120 dmg, now with lore spells we should have gotten a better line. 315 mana use to do 640 damage does not even equate to 400 mana 1120 damage of ice comet. We are still spending more mana than before to only deal out an extra 160 damage. This again is stupid, we need to at least help our groups out with killing higher level mobs, and not spend our lives medding and sitting out for the next three pulls so we can med up.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I see no mention of the low damage low casting cost fast casting speed spells that some of us mentioned that would solve some problems. Also like to remind absor that Rain, shadowstep and BOTH snare type spells for wizards have z-axis problems in case he is still confused. Also some bugs that should be fixed :<P>-Line of sight : When casting something at a monster in plain view, you get a message stating you have no line of sight AFTER you've casted the spell and it cost you mana. If you couldn't see it you should not be able to cast at it to begin with.<P>-Damage Skins : These eat up a gem every time you get interrupted. Should not be used til its cast.<P>-Miscalculated resistances : Fire goblins should never resist ice comet. Currently you get a total resist on fire goblins almost 1 out of 10 which is way unrealistic. This may be affecting other mobs of opposing types as well. May have something to do with the random number generator, because once it resists ice comet it is almost likely they will resist it a second time.<P>-Melee interupts : When a monster FIRST attacks a wizard from that initial contact, they ALWAYS interrupt our spell, even a level 1 goblin. They get a unrealistic high chance to hit us even though we are facing them. This needs to be fixed.<P>-Bonds/shackles getting overwritten : Some spell from another class is cancelling our bond line spells so that mobs speed back up. Dunno which one yet will find out.<P>-Shaman's talisman lines spells: They are still overriding our shielding line spells and no way to remove them unless you cast cancel magic on yourself. They trade less AC for only a little more HP which is not a good idea.<P>These are some of the major bugs I have seen as a wizard, there might be more but certainly some that should be fixed imediately<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Ok here are my two cents<P>I think that we should take a look at some of the fantasy books to find our solutions to class balance. If you have ever read fantasy you will fall in love with one of the classes. I fell in love with the power of the wizard. Here is how I have always seen the classes.<P>·Warrior: Can take a beating and keep on ticking and deal awesome dam overtime<BR>·Rouge: Awesome dam in a sort time but can’t take much of a beating<BR>·Hybrid: Mix between caster and Fighter not as skilled as a true war but has spells for backup in a long fight can almost keep up with a true warrior.<BR>·Cleric: Healer and buffer can melee if need to, but little dam and not much stamina but can hold his or her own for a short time.<BR>·Wizard: Master of the blast can out damage everyone and hit almost everything, but is frail and cannot take hits.<BR>·Other casters: great utility spells and can hold their own in a battle. Those with pets should be able to outlast the wizard in a fight but it will take them a long time to catch up to the dam the wiz did in the battle.<P>I think most of the classes in EQ live up to this except for the wizard and here is why.<P>1.Resisted we will never be able to out damage a Warrior if we can’t get our spells to stick. I think that the drought spells are a joke and we should not need them to effect higher-level mobs. If the only thing we bring to a group is damage then let us do our job and let us be effective. The manna to damage on the drought line is not effective.<P>2.Manna: the only thing that we are the masters of at this time is medding and we don’t seem to be able to do that fast. One of the reasons we can’t keep up in dam with a warrior is it takes a warrior about 6sec to heal with a cleric in the group. It takes about 20min for a wiz to get all of his or her manna back even with clarity and harvest. Why do we not have a spell that can give us manna like it gives the warriors life? I don’t think that we need more manna we just need a way to get it back fast. Or maybe a way to store it like a energy ball that you can draw from during battles and recharge in your down time.<P>3.Groups: If we find a way to fix the top two I think we will be able to get into groups. I have been told many times by friends and others that they do not want to group with my wizard. Mainly because I need to med allot! If we are going through a dungeon that is full of blues I need two sit and med after every 3 battles. This is very dangerous for the group because of repops and wanderers. I use spells that are 3 spell levels behind my level so I don’t go oom and seem to barely help in the battle.<P>When Kunark and Velous came out the mobs got more hit points. To compensate for this the warriors find better weapons and armor but what about the caster classes? I did not find any new DD spells in Kunark or Velous so that I could use keep up with the increase in mobs hit points. The melee classes can keep up with increases in hit points by getting better weapons and armor. All that this has done is taken a slightly broken class and made it crippled. <P>I think the key to the wizard class is a way to get back manna fast. I truly think we should be able to get it back the same way as a warrior gets back life. We need a way to get it back fast during a battle. I think the best way to do this is through a storage device. Maybe make it a quest Item that you can do at every wizard guild and have it increase with levels.<P>Level 10 – Pointe hat of minor spell storage: Can store 1/4 your manna pool for easy access (right click effect) to release manna. Takes a low quality gem (malachite) that is used up during casting. Give it a 1:1 storage ratio.  So it takes 100mana + Gem to store 100mana.<P>Level 20 – Cap of the master: Can store up to 1/2 your manna pool, but is done in two castings each casting cost a cats eye agate and does 1/4 of your manna pool. Right click will release 1/4  back into the manna pool.<P>Level 30 – Cap of the Adept: Can store up to 2/3 of your manna pool, done in 3 casting 1/3 each and cost a bloodstone.<P>I think you get the point and please make it a quest that can be done a the proper level. Not a level 10 item that you can’t get till your 25. Plus it would give us wizards out pointy hats!<P>My two cents, <BR>Liloth Impbane<BR>34lvl wizard <BR>Druzzel Ro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A Wizard should NOT get damage shields, group buffs, the ability to channel damage through others, etc.  These are traits found in other classes (or should be).<P>The only way to make a Wizard group friendly is to allow the class to continue dumping damage into mobs over time.  Eliminate as much down time as possible through increasing the Wizards efficiency.  When you elimnate downtime, you are in essence increasing damage output over the course of a raid, session, etc.  When Wizards are truly the masters of direct damage, then we will become group friendly, if not in high demand.<P>Everyone please focus on what a Wizard is (or should be) and try not to blend the defenition of this class into other classes.<P>Buffing=Shaman/Cleric/Druid/Enchanter<BR>Damage Shields=Mage/Druid<BR>Crowd Control=Enchanter/Druid (Wiz is secondary)<BR>Healing=Cleric/Druid<BR>Pets=Mage/Necro/Shaman/Druid<BR>Traveling=Druids/Wiz(secondary)<P>DIRECT DAMAGE=WIZARD<P>Focus arguments for improvement to the Wizard class on:<P>1. spell efficiency<BR>2. damage output (extended amount of time)<BR>   (1 and 2 if ever fixed will yield teh final point of focus)<BR>3.

</FONT><HR>And I quote, from Absor:"<P>Evaks and damage are what wizards bring to a group, and I think that should be enough, if it’s all working right. "<P>Thing is, aside from a couple nice little toys (the laughable damage shield line, the useful but limited stun line, our two buffs, invis/see invis) This is really all we give to the group.  Nukes and evacs.  I think you've been convinced now that our nukes need upgrading past Mage levels, but seriously, why is it several of our evac/port locations are far, FAR inferior to their druid counterparts?  Skyfire is the most obvious example; the Druid port in is (relatively) safe, while the wizzy port area is damn near guaranteed to get you killed, should you use it.  This is what we gave up heals, sow, dots, and damage shields for?  Lesser port locations?  <P>Other examples would be Cazic Thule/Feerroott port locations (Wizard's port gets themselves killed, Druid port is 100% safe save for the very small chance of a wandering bouncer) The fact that Druids get a port to the commons area a spell rank before we do, and they have a reliable port to South Ro (not an evac, as we have to rely on).  And this is without even mentioning the Wakening Lands Woushi problem.<P>Of course, save for teleporting about Kunark, there' no real need for additional evacs anyway.  Personally, I only ever load up two evacs, North Karana (if there's no evils in the party) and Greater Fay.  Why?  These are the lowest level evacs, and I have a better chance of channeling through the hits should I get attacked during the port.  There’s simply no compelling reason for me to load the other evacs on the list.  Would it be asking too much to lower more of these evacs down to 20/ 24?  We’d still be warranted getting the actual Portal upgrades later on in our careers, as they’d be more reliable.<P>Also not mentioned was the lack of variety in our nukes.  In our entire pre-50 careers, the only thing that shows up different about our nukes is more damage, better ratio, and increased casting time, with a couple dangerous and resistible throwback attributes thrown in.  Every spell rank, another spell in our book becomes useless as we move on to the next best thing.  Why not give some more attributes to these spells, so we have reason to use them longer, and not just wish we could rip them off the page so we don't have to flip through them?  Faster casting nukes, lower resist nukes (although not on anything near the scale as Lure), Nukes with dot components, small magic resistance debuff nukes, high taunt nukes, long range nukes...  It's kinda silly that our best spells, the ones we look forward to each spell level, get discarded like unwanted toys every new level, no?<P>And would a fast casting, long recast, zero (or low) level nuke be unbalancing to our class?  It'd at the very least give us something to do while we med back our mana while the group is actually doing stuff to kill the mob.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Face it, to balance the class, you have to make wizards better solo'rs.  They're not buffers, they dont need group spells, they need harder faster more powerful more mana efficient spells.  This will mean we can solo better.  Seriously, is it really going to ruin the game?  YOu can solo up to 60 but you'll never get any loot or see anything.  I'd say a large percentage of wizzes solo up to 50 anyway.  <P>I've been saying this since class threads started- the wizard, as seen in the Vision, is fundamentally flawed at its core, following the release of Kurnak and to a greater extent Velious.  To "balance" the wizard (IE making him more playable) you'll have to make him a better solo'r.  There is just NO WAY around this.  Leave it up to the players to decide how they are goign to play their wizard.  <P>Wizards have been ignored and broken for almost a year- if the changes allow us to solo better, so be it.  Personally, if I'm more powerful and more of a damage dealer, I'll still group b/c I'll actually be able to find one (in theory at least)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>10 step plan for making all classes "balanced" once and for all.<P>Btw, all this has to happen on the same patch day.<P>Step 1 - Add 4 extra slots in everyones Vault.<P>Step 2 - In the 4 new slots in the Vault, put a spell bag in each. The spell bag would only hold spell scrolls, but would hold up to 50 scrolls in each bag, for a total of 200 slots.<P>Step 3 - The first time a character logs into the game after this patch, all the spells in its spell book are individually removed and placed on a generated spell scroll. This basically removes all the spells from one spell book and places them in there vault.<P>Step 4 - Make all Armor and Weapons, Class ALL, Race ALL.<P>Step 5 - Remove all skill restrictions on classes, giving all the classes the ability to train and improve to the same skill level as any other class.<P>Step 6 - Give Melee classes the ability to cast spells.<P>Step 7 - Add the ability to remove spells from ones spellbook, by scribing them on to scrolls.<P>Step 8 - Remove the Class restrictions on all spells, with duplicate spells, Cleric - Pally, Necro - Shadowknight for instance, remove the higher level spells from the game by exchanging them with the lower level version of the same spell.<P>Step 9 - Setup a rules for the number of spells of a certain level that can be scribed into one's spellbook.<BR>Any class could have up to:<BR>6 - level 1 spells<BR>8 - level 4 spells - or 8 more lvl 1 spells<BR>8 - level 8 spells - or 8 more lvl 1-4 spells<BR>8 - level 12 spells - or 8 more lvl 1-8 spells<BR>8 - level 16 spells - or 8 more lvl 1-12 spells<BR>8 - level 20 spells - or 8 more lvl 1-16 spells<BR>8 - level 24 spells - or 8 more lvl 1-20 spells<BR>8 - level 29 spells - or 8 more lvl 1-24 spells<BR>8 - level 34 spells - or 8 more lvl 1-29 spells<BR>8 - level 39 spells - or 8 more lvl 1-34 spells<BR>8 - level 44 spells - or 8 more lvl 1-39 spells<BR>8 - level 49 spells - or 8 more lvl 1-44 spells<BR>4 - level 51 spells - or 4 more lvl 1-49 spells<BR>4 - level 52 spells - or 4 more lvl 51 spells<BR>and so on till lvl 60<P>Step 10 - Increase the difficulty of mobs to compensate for the increase in player character power.<P>Summary: A classes would be balanced.

</FONT><HR>You REALLY Want to help out the wizards in a group.<BR>Fix our AE spells. Some of our best AE spells not only hit the mob but also our group members. Yea as if the tank isn't taking enough dmg already when i lay down a nice AE on the mob. <P>My thinking on making this an easy fix is to lessen the aggro on us if we cast a high lvl DD spell on the mob. As opposed to casting our AE spells. Then we can still lay down good <BR>dmg to mana and not pull aggro off the tank. And or we really REALLY need to be able to have more mana.<BR>A monk can have almost no down time and seems to be the best melee class. If we are to be the best caster class we should have less down time also.<P>One more thing. Why are we the only pure casters without some kind of pet? Sure we have Yonder,Fade and ShadowStep but ask any wiz if he would give up those 3 spells to have just one pet for fodder. I am sure this is impossible but it would be nice to have a pet of some kind that does nothing but take dmg enough for you to get away and zone. Or increas the speed of out gate spell would also solve a lot of these issues.<P>Thanks for letting us wiz's vent here Sony.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I haven't taken the time to read the 11 pages of posts of others.  If I do duplicate others ideas please look at it as yet another wizard wanting the same thing, not as useless spamming.<P>1) Don't nerf bonds of force to be single target only.  While it does make sense that you can't target multiple mobs for snare until you learn how to target one, doesn't mean we should not be able to.  Instead give us snare at a lower level, say 24th.<P>2) Neither increase our mana pool nor our mana regen rate will fix things.  Doing both would help though.  A larger mana pool will allow us to nuke more before medding and therefore maybe being useful for a whole fight.  Faster mana regen would help us be ready with everyone else for the next fight instead of medding through and only really helping every other fight.  I would like to see us be able to regen mana normally while fighting and double our mana regen while medding.  And having clarity and bard regen stack with this.  That would go a long way to fixing our downtime uselessness.<P>3)An innate bonus to resist magic makes sense for wizards.  If we are the masters of magic we should be able to avoid it's damaging effects better.<P>4) Give us west commons port earlier than 39th.  I have had people asking for it since I was 19th level.  The druids get it much earlier than us so there isn't a reason you don't want people ported there at a lower level.<P>5) Being able to do critical hits with our spells like warriors do in melee.  I know I suggested it before and it is on your list.  I just want to reiterate I think it is the single best way to help us.<P>6) Give us Call of the Hero.  It doesn't make sense to me that Magicians have it at all.  They don't have anything to do with moving pc's around.  Druids and Wizards should have it and they should not.<P>7)Move Translocate to 20th level.  That is when I started seeing a need for it and not having until 50th just sucks.<P>8)The Blink spell is a good concept, but please do not use shadow step as the result when hit.  After you are hit a couple of times you won't go anywhere any more because you are at the lowest point around and they will get to hit you for free anyway with it.  Unless you fix that whole line so that it no longer has that problem.<P>9)A shield spell line that reduces mana instead of hit points as long as it is up and you are being hit in melee.  It would prevent the mobs from hitting us so no spell interrupts and no getting stunned.  Would allow the melee types time to taunt them off of us before we die.  A serious downside would be we are much more likely to run out of mana, but at least we will be alive to meditate.  If we ran out of mana and they were still hitting us then it would go down and the damage would switch to hit points normally.<BR>    It could be a line of spells by giving us a 1:1 damage/mana ratio version at low level, say 5th.  A 2:1 ratio at say 20th.  A 3:1 ratio at around 40th.  And a 4:1 ratio at 60th.<P>10) A damage shield line that is fast casting and makes us immune to damage.  After I wrote that I realized the clerics already have it.  Maybe give that spell line to us as well?<P>11) We have big damage spells with spell interrupt stuns at 29th and 34th, but not much in the way of decent stuns between 20th and 49th level.  Tishan's Clash at 20th is great, but we don't get an improvement on it until 51st level.  And Markar's Clash doesn't come until 49th.  Maybe give us another dd/stun spell, around 29th or 34th, that is somewhere between Tishan's Clash and Markar's Clash in power.  To add to the feeling that we get a wider variety and to juggle resistances make it cold based maybe.  Say Mana 100 Cast Time 2.5 Recast 18 DD 100+ 1 or 2 per level Stun duration 8 seconds.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor wrote:<P>&lt;I&gt;Anyhow. The one thing I seem to have missed is any real method of making wizards more group friendly. Personally, I think that if we find a way to make wizards a little more efficient with their ability to blow stuff up, then they will immediately become wanted.&lt;/I&gt;<P>Admittedly I have not been able to keep up with the 450+ replies in this thread so someone may have suggested this already but why not add a small amount of extra damage for each person in the group to make us more group friendly? This is similar in theory to the experience changes made several patches back that made a full group take a larger chunk of experience than a partial group. The reasoning behind it would be that as the masters of knowledge and quick damage we have discovered how to harness the aura's of our group members and focus them at our enemies to magnify our normal mana blasts.<P>For example my lure of flame that now does 640 points of damage might do 650 damage with 3 members in the group 670 damage with 4 members in the group, 680 damage with 5 members in the group and 710 damage with a full group.<P>Another factor that would be good to work into a system like the one above is the levels of your group members randomly affecting the damage output as well. If the average level of your group is 51-53 you get a .25% increase in damage up to a 1.5% increase in damage if the average level of the group is 58-60. The higher level your group members are the larger the modifiers since they have stronger aura's. I think a random damage component of some sort would be nice because it gets tedious seeing the same dmg over and over. Its very fun for warriors and even the rest of the group to see a warrior try and beat their personal best critical hit when they use a disc. This is something along those lines.<P>Another possible random modifier could be the Int of the wizard. As masters of knowledge we dont max out our int very often since the popular conception is that Int over 255 doesnt expand our mana pool enough to make it worth the hit to stats and resists. Make a scale that increases the damage of our spells the higher our Int is. Perhaps at 201-210 int we get a .5% increase in damage, at 211-220 we get a .75% increase in damage, at 221-230 we get a 1% increase in damage, at 231-240 we get a 1.5% increase in damage, at 241-250 we get a 1.75% increase in damage and finally at max Int of 255 we get a 2.25% increase in damage. Naturally these percentages can be higher or lower as necessary. Instead of hard percentages each range of Int might have a range of percentages that would be randomly rolled between and added to your base dmg. This would allow for further randomization. I understand this involves a significant amount of coding but its a thought at least.<P>In my opinion the methods about would not be unbalancing since the absolute highest amount of damage we could do in the example above with a lure of flame for example would be 784 which isnt all that much more damage. Perhaps adding both the group bonus and int bonus would be interesting to further bump up our damage.<P>Pirotess T'Enithar<BR>Guildmaster, Guild Shadowed Soul<BR>Cazic-Thule Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"Remember the goal is for we, the Wizards, a one-trick class, to match the damage output of our one-trick melee counterparts, the Rogues."<P>To match the damage output how? Over the course of 5 seconds? 10 seconds? Over the course of a minute? Over the course of 30 minutes? an hour? If the answer is yes to all of the above, half your nukes would be very efficient dots, and the other half would be very cheap to cast but have a 90% average resist rate.<P>Furthermore nukes by their very nature have a great deal of flexibility that melee or dots simply do not have. You can choose exactly when you want to apply the damage. <P>If a wizard and rogue do X points of damage per hour, but the rogue can only do it in a trickle and a wizard can open it like a flood at will, the X points of damage the wizard can do are infinitely more valuable to a group or raid than the X the rogue can do.<P>Nukes by their very nature offer you a tremendous degree of tactical flexibility, and that should come with substantial drawbacks.<P>This isn't to say that wizard nukes shouldn't be stronger or more mana efficient. They absolutely should! Wizards should be much much better at their specialty than they are now.<P>HOWEVER, the point that must not be lost is that a wizard's specialty is nuking, not damage.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 13 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-11.html">11</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;12&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-13.html">13</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000784&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000784&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
