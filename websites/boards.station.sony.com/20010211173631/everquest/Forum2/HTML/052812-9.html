</FONT><HR>2 Major Issues:<P>1) Monks have no Hit Points, our hp's are not much better than a druid. At lvl 50 a monk has about 300 hp's less than a lvl 40 ranger (without typical hp adding items.) I get about 23 hp's a lvl, from lvl 40 to 50 thats 230 hp's and the mobs start hitting so much harder. To counteract this Monks were given FD which has been nerfed twice. 3 times In a row Fd was "seen thru" by Orcs in EW, once causing my death. Either give us more hp's or un-nerf FD. Its the only thing a monk has that makes him special and the best puller in the game (in one day)<P>2) Increase the dmg/del output on fists. For those who started a monk from scratch, and dont have the $ (because of weight issues) to buy uber weapons for them, they will at least be able to compete until they hit 50. Also a monks fists should be the most dmg weapon he has at the highest lvl's except for a few of the rarer monk weapons like a Tranquil Staff, etc.<P>Verants Vision for monks was that they would be the highest melee dmg dealers in the game, now with all of the Uber 1hs weapons for Warriors and rangers, they do about as much dmg as monks and have more hp's, etc. Restore us to the great class we were on release. <BR>How can monks be balanced when we cannot taunt mobs off casters. Most groups will pick a warrior over a monk anyday of the week and a monk is only needed in certain dungeons for FD pulling, and if you have a good enchanter not even then. Please take this under advisement.<BR>Thanks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My two biggest disappointments of monks where when 1.Kunark was release and they went from mostly equipment independent hand to hand fighters to equipment dependent weapon fighters.<BR>2. the way one special move replaces the previous move. roundkick replaces kick. Eagle claw replaces round kick, etc. You lose all those neat animation moves and that kung fu feel.<P>It's too late to change things now but I would've loved for the post 50 increase in damage to have come from unlinking the monk's special attacks instead of requiring them to weild weapons. Imagine a monk punching, kicking, round kicking, a strike, a flying kick... instead they're duel weilding a pair of Sailor Moon's old wands or something equally dumb looking.<P>And don't get me started on the robes. Ugh, why did you make monks wear dresses like that? Why?<P>My monk got retired for esthetic reasons  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree with Zadkiel and bodi's post all the way. We already discussed this and we are all pretty much in agreement.<P>We dont care if our hp is low.<BR>We like our ac like it is.<P>We dont care if mobs give us a beatdown once they turn on us.<P>What we care about is doing more damage to compensate for the skill advantage we lost with kunark.<P>And dont give me this Tranquil staff/peacebringer bull. I dont like minority examples given to the majority.<P>Also, here is a few ideas I have thought of.<P>When a monk is NOT wielding a weapon, double the chances of block and dodge. <P>When a monk is NOT attacking, also give an added advantage to block or dodge.<P>Since we will be attacking most of the times, it wont change much, but a monk concentrating on defendes not encumbured with a weapon should have far more chance to block or dodge than a monk attacking or wielding a weapon.<P>If you dont wanna augment the amount of hp mend gives. How about giving it the effect of clearing all bad status ailments at 200 of skill?<P>But mainly...<P>Give us stuff to raise our damage, it's what we do. It's our bread and butter. Do double flying kick, raise flying kick and thunderkick minimal damage by a good amount (people, you can't know what shame it is to thunderkick for 24 damage and the warrior crits right after for 64).<P>And when you come to us and tells us that a monk needs a tranquil staff to outdamage anyone except maybe rogues...<P>Then it actually prove our point that you have slacked far too long for monks damage output.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First off I must agree with the Zadkiels /Bodi post, it seems to contain just about everything.  <P>A few small issues I have being a younger monk (19) are...<P>1. Iskar sparring armor.  Nice armor for a young monk except that escaped frogloks are over hunted in a zone that is under populated.  Many times I have types /who to find that I am the only person in the zone.  Then again when I am not usually it's only filled with other people looking for shackles.  Every class in Cabilis needs these rare spawn no drop items for quests.  Please up the spawn rate.<P>2. Before I knew that MoBs didn't take damage from a fall I would pull to the top of the pit in FoB then jump in hopes of softening up a mob.  Okay, so why don't mobs take damage from a fall?  This seems like a reasonable hunting tactic for monks since safe fall is such a specific skill. A little bit of danger added in, as you never know how much damage you'll take from a fall, especially at lower safe fall levels.  Of course you'd still have to do a majority of the damage to the mob or the corpse would poof.<P>3. Tailoring. This is a hard skill to learn on Kunark as… well, the only pelt dropping critters that I can use to practice on are Saber cats, tigers, ect and they only drop pelts of any sort rarely.  I had to take a trip to EC just to hunt green wolves and bears to get enough pelts to raise my skill to make raw silk.  I would have used spider silk from the FoB to practice on except that at 19 I only have two full stacks of silks in the bank (saving them to make raw/cured silks for myself).  Not sure how to fix it, maybe just make the cats drop pelts a bit more often.<P>Just my thoughts<BR>Sukani<BR>19 monk of Luclin<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I agree that monks need a way to increase their saves around 30ish.  There's nothing like going into Dalnir looking for no-drop armour when you get blasted to hell by a ice spell because of crap cold save.<P>My suggestion is to make it possible to have the ability to add saves to cured silk armour.  If the silk is cured with something moderately difficult to get (i.e. quest, dropped item off appropriate lvl mobs, or trade skill made) you could add some saves to already light eq.  If this was quest based, you could give your Cured Silk item + quest items to the NPC and he would give you back a new piece of armour with the same stats as cured silk, but with added saves (+2 to +5 range to one or two saves).  It would also be neat to be able to customize this so that a monk could decide what saves they wanted.  i.e. you could turn in the same quest items to the same NPC, but a different piece of cured silk to result in the same saves.<P>This would also make it easier for monks to get away from looking the same.  For example if you were to get a CR Cured Silk Gi, it would be white in color, and would show up that way when worn.  But if you wanted a MR Cured Silk Gi, it could be blue, FR could be red, etc.  This would make monks more stylish  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Changing weapons and armor is NOT going to happen, MOST armor monks use at higher lvl's is all/all or can be used by other classes.<BR>The real issues here are feign death and damage output.<BR>Modify feign death, make it actually fool the mob a greater percentage of time, make it stop the mob from casting( in most cases)<BR>Flying kick-- im lvl 60 and still hit for 3.<BR>Gimme a break eh? im a GRANDMASTER kicking for 3 damage! Make a minimal damage per lvl with flying kick.<BR>Hand to Hand -- raise h2h above 2hb or 1hb.<BR>We are suppose to be the masters of hand to hand but our skills are equal to 1 hand blunt and 2 hand blunt? come on.... Try capping it as least 10 points over either skill.<BR>Disciplines-- Most disciplines are a joke, we need a defensive discipline that lasts longer then 12 sec....being a monk i do find myself out taunting warriors and getting the big ole beat down, did i say feign death didnt fool these pissed off mobs also? thats why a longer lasting defensive discipline would be nice.<BR>Hit Points at levels 50-60. Ok, im not asking for a warriors HP's, but a small raise in base HP per lvl 50-60 would not hurt, at lvl 60 i current have around 2000 HP.<P>thats all i have atm<P>Tyrani</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Only problem that I see is the stacking of celestial tranquility.<P>1. It doesnt stack with other haste spells<BR>	Make it item haste so that I can be much more effective in any standard group, because an enchanter will be present in every high level group.<P>2. Celestial tranquility doesnt stack with Call of Earth<BR>	Not sure why this is in place, a ranger can come up to me, put call of earth on me and lower my effectiveness in combat, especially when soloing.  This is basically a debuff to monks with their celesital fists<P>3. If the celestial fists were an item-based haste, then I could get rid of my other haste item. In my case, sadly still an fbss, but this would still allow me to use a nice ac item, or even a thicked banded belt in my waste slot which would improve my ac and haste in group situations..which monks will always be in.<P>4.  If there is a group of 5 who could use any class in their group (meaning they have an enchanter and cleric in the group) and they just need any melee/fighter class, not necessarily a tank, and they dont need a puller, then there is absolutly no reason to choose a monk over a rogue.  Rogues in a group outdamage me by such a large factor, that it is hard to call monks a damage-dealing class anymore.  When rogues can double backstab for 500 at my level, and I can flying kick for a max of about 130, and usually 3, the difference becomes quite apparent.  And now in places like sebellis where rogues are needed to get to certain areas, then there would certainly be no reason for the group to choose a monk over a rogue.<P>Please take the advice of the monks on this board.  Many have spent alot of time playing monks and know the good and bad things about the class and they know what needs to be changed.  No one is asking for dramatic, unbalancing changes, but simply a reason for groups to want a monk in their group, because as of now, there is very little reason for any group to want a monk, other than for feign pulling, which you have very well nearly eliminated in velious.  <P>Kaadin<BR>54th monk of the Innoruuk server<BR>Justifiers  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The only think I can think of to help Monks out a bit concerns stuns.  I seem to get stunned a LOT.  Maybe make them 50% resistant to stuns while they're facing an enemy.   I don't think giving our fists or special attacks a chance to stun would be too overpowering either.

</FONT><HR>Feign Death<P>There are a few methods of crowde control int eh game, notably mes, slow, root, charm and FD pulling. <P>FD pulling was a significant part of the game and made monks a viable and wanted class. In SoV and teh hole for exampls this is no logner the case as mobs do not train back. You have eliminated the viability of the monk class in these zones.<P>Further FD should have an intrinsic evade type of skill implemented into it. That being, if FD does not completely wipe the aggro then it knocks you down the hate list as others have suggested.<P>As for the epic it to should have a diffierent graphic of sorts as noone can tell that you even have it unless their graphics maxed and no weapon is equipped in the offhand.

</FONT><HR>BIG issue to my monk is the pain Everquest is to quest in.<P>Spending 150+hours camping the raster of guk would drive anyone crazy. I know that he is supposed to be rare and that a lot of people aren't supposed to have the robe but thats just too long of a wait.  <P>Why not make him spawn once every 10 EQ days. This makes us wait a while, BUT at least we know that he will spawn. <P>I have TRIED to camp him for about 2 months now (on and off), most of the time i sit in that stupid little fire pot waiting for him to come OR i log in to find a phat Druid camping him for his twink (which is very dumb).<P>Please fix his spawn so that the wait is reasonable, thanks.<P>ALSO, give the treant fists an effect like they once had, (no CH) but like a "skin like wood" or "inner fire" or "minor shielding", something low lvl that will make them worth camping, (yet another long long quest).<P>1 last thing, make FD at lvl 32+ work the same as it did 32-. The FD pulling allowed us to out smart our opponent. This can be shown by the fact that its very very hard to FD between Chain casting mobs. They are too smart BUT the warrior and other non-caster mobs were fooled.

</FONT><HR>Greetings,<BR>  Great posts and so far I agree with most of what is being said.  Just decided to add my words to the crowd.<P>Wanted to make sure that people realize that the problems that the 50+ level Monks are seeing are NOT confined to just those levels.  I encounter them on a daily basis.<P>  Damage output: This is not just a post 50 problem.  I am currently level 32 and am consistantly outdamaged by warriors and sometimes even rangers (not very often but it has happened).<P>  Weapons: I do disagree with increasing damage through weapons.  I really feel Monks should be using their fists.<P>  Damage Evasion:  Not much to add.  More just agree that a Monk should have more avoidance and one would think would be a lot better at dodgin than someone carrying 150 stones of Armor and loot.<P>  No group Role:  There have been several posts stating this and I agree.  Monks no longer have a defined role except to be a mana drain on the healers and buffers when they try to keep the Monk alive and kicking (FOR 3 POINTS!! &lt;grrrr&gt; )<P>Something I would like to see that I have not seen metioned.<BR>  Some sort of 100% weight reduction pack (Even 2 slots) available to lower level Monks so we can loot a weapon or two and make some money.<P>Quests:<BR>  Stop making the higher level Monks go back and redo lower quests. RotWF, etc.  Give us the item back or do something so that the Monks trying to get the item for the first time are not in direct competion with people coming back to get it again.<BR>  Monk quests seem to take longer than other class quests.  I have not done a lot of research on this but everyone I talk to or get assistance from to do my quests always say that Monk quests are the biggest pains out of all of them.  I don't mind a quest being difficult but boring is not something they should be (Treant Fist Quest for example, EVERY Monk knows the gorge all too well).<P><BR>  Thanks to everyone for putting forth the great ideas.<P>Fandelar<BR>32 Level Human Monk<BR>Prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here's what I'd do if I was working on Monks:<P>Remove the system where using one special attack grays out all other special attacks.  That way you could mix them up in a dazzling display of special moves, sweeping kicks, spinnning, junping, it would look wonderful.  It would also raise the damage slightly overall and monks would make more sense from a role playing perspective.<P>How many martial arts do you know where you learn ONE move, and each move supplants the previous one, never used again?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am sure this will get over looked as you browse your way threw all the gimmie gimmie posts but here is what I feel is wrong with our class in regards to balance, not wants...<P>Monks in the upper levels 50-60 are supposed to be masters of toe to toe damage but we as a whole feel that having 5-10% more damage than a warrior is not enough. It should have been more like 30-40% and I will go into the reasons why and what you need to stop doing.<P>Monks are supposed to sacrifice armor however you keep adding items in the game that boost our AC well over other classes and with luck monks can expect to get well over 1100AC if they pack on the non monk items. Stop releasing the AC items and make our class what we are supposed to be, warriors that dish out mass melee damage.<P>Another note on items, stop releasing uber items that all classes can use when it comes to armor and weapons, releasing a 15/20 blunt into the game that ALL classes can use is utter crap! this is the sort of thing that causes class imbalance over time. Same goes with armor stop adding ubber items that we monks can wear, 15ac legs on a monk is insane same goes with 30+ BPs, think before you screw up the balance when you add items.<P>What you should have done is put in a marker, a percentage of where each melee class are supposed to be in regards to there level when it comes to damage/damage mitigation and pure AC.<P>In closing I must say monks need a boost in damage output for melee and a reduction of items that grant uber AC. Also that you need to stop releasing weapons that other classes can use when it infringes on the others prim abilities to do damage. Why would a party want a monk when a warrior can fill his sandals?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am curious about one thing, Double Attack. It suppose to make check to see if attack sucessful make double hit in round. But there are one thing that always bother me, Rouge have double attack too and it does the double attack check on backstab that mean rouge can do double backstab if double attack roll is sucessful on backstab. But with monk, I have never seen that any of special attack does double, i.e., double attack roll check on flying kick, tiger claw, etc. So, why rogue got double attack roll on backstab and monk dont get any on special attack?<P>Other idea.<P>Why there are no hand to hand weapon? Yeah you say it is programming issues. Well what about this.<P>Just a idea:<P>Hand to Hand weapon<BR>add 3 damage to fist damage table<BR>decrease 2 delay to fist delay table<BR>So that way not have to make its own dmg or delay but rather overwrite the fist delay/dmg table by wearing the hand to hand weapon, by adding or decrease dmg/delay.

</FONT><HR>Some very good and reasonable suggestions in Zadikel/Bodi's post(pg2).  I also liked the shorter note on pg6 by Zantetsuken.<P>In relation to some of the concerns mentioned in those 2 posts and others, here are a few suggestions for your concideration...<P>1) Haste could effect our special attacks  (increased damage output)<P>2) Haste could effect our damage avoidance skills  (decreased damage taken)<P>3) Increase effectiveness of riposte/block/dodge  (decrease damage taken)<P>4) An innate defensive mode when not attacking, add extra riposte/block/dodge tests against incomming attacks.  (allow a mob to de-agro, an evade type ability, could possibly effect how FD works to make it a "save my life" skill that is effective at 50+, i.e. if you have not attacked for 5sec(defensive mode), FD has a much higher chance for success even vs frenzied mob)<P>5) Destroying coin gets very tedious very quickly, make it more automated please...one possible solution would be to add a "/destroycoin copper/silver/gold/plat" where "/destroycoin gold" would destroy all coins gold and under, could then be put in a hotkey.  Could also be made a perm switch, but could see some money loss when dealing with the bank, so a hotkey would probably be safer.<P>6) As masters of our own mind and body, add innate resistances that increase with lvl like AC, possibly these are also decreased when over the AC weight limit.<P>7) If adding effects to special abilities is being concidered(such as stun), I offer these possibilities in addition to the ones I read earlier.  My thought process on these is that a monk knows where and how to hit an opponent so an effect is achieved, such as a nerve bundle or other specific area.  a) Damage over Time  b)A debuffing effect(like an attack speed, AC, or ATK debuff, not a "remove magical effect" debuff  c) some sort of hold/subdue manuever...could stop the mob from doing anything for some short period of time, the monk as well(similar to stun??)  or could be more like a snare?? <P>Ok, enough of that.  I liked what I understood as a difference between Monks and other Melee in the fact that AC wasn't a main concern for Monk, as they relied on their skills to avoid damage.  This is no longer true(if it ever was) and even to our supposedly damage avoiding Monks, AC is highly saught after.  I would like to see a migration away from this and make Monks more reliant on skills than AC/HP.  I also agree that we are far from the "masters of melee damage" or the "body honed into a pure weapon" that was tauted in the manual.<P>Just as a sidenote on the Human/Iksar debate, I think the Iksar advantages are over-rated, and the diasadvantages are passed over as "not that important."  Here is what I think.  a)Iksar Regen is not that important at higher levels  b)bad Faction can be overcome in some cases, but takes alot of tedious work  c)20% Race Exp penalty is a huge disadvantage.  That being said, at lvl 60 an Iksar is probably superior to a Human due mainly AC bonus, and maybe something should be done about that.  But at lvl 60, a Troll Warrior is probably superior to a Halfling Warrior.<P>The one thing I would like the powers that be to address what the role of the Monk is in a group and what value add they are supposed to bring to a group, i.e. tell me why I want a Monk in my group??  What is your "vision" for the monk??  Then explain in some detail why the suggestions(at least the popular ones) are viable or not.<P>I read all the previous messages before composing this, please forgive any typo's or misspellings(sp?) as it well past my bedtime.<P>I hope some good comes from these posts  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
