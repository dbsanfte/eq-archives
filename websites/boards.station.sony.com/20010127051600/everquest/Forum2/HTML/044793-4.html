</FONT><HR>&lt;&lt;Misicius wrote:<P>&gt;"I still dont understand why mana transfer cant be one to one. The only way I can see that this would double a necromancers mana pool is that because our spells are close to the most inefficient for mana, if not the worst."&lt;<P>Absor said in response:<BR>Let me try to go over my logic with the whole mana transfer thing. Keep in mind that players will be more creative than me…<P>But if a necromancer could transfer mana 1:1 then he could throw his mana around at will. Using the Lichy spells, he can convert his hit points 1:1 to mana. So when low on hit points, he can give mana 1:1 to a cleric. A cleric can heal the necromancer at a ratio better than 2:1. In essence, then, the a necromancer working with a cleric could create mana from nothing… and that doesn't even consider regeneration…<P>I hope that's clear: 1 necromancer hit point becomes 1 necromancer mana, which becomes 1 cleric mana, which is then turned into 2 necromancer hit points, which can become 2 necromancer mana…<P>It's what Magic: The Gathering players call infinite mana. Usually when that happens, you take your cards and go home. &gt;&gt;<P><BR>here's the numbers behind this situation you described Absor:<P>L49 Lich takes 32 hp and gives you 20 mana every tick, which is 6 seconds.<P>L44 Covetous Subversion  takes 300 mana and gives 100 to the target player.<P>With a 3:1 ratio:<BR>Let's say i cast Covetous Subversion on a cleric twice, i blow 600 mana to give him/her 200 mana.  I am unsure how fast we regenrate mana from meditation, so i'll guess that from meditation L50+ casters get 20 mana per tick when sitting.  Therefore a necro with Lich on would regenerate 40 mana per tick total between the two.  for me to get back that 600 mana, would take 15 ticks or 90 seconds.  in 90 seconds i lose 480 hp (assuming no regeneration of any kind is on).  In this time the cleric has meditated 300 mana plus has the 200 mana i gave him/her for a total of 500 mana, which is enough for 1 Complete Heal, and is not enough for neither 1 Ressurection or 1 Reviviscence.  With this ratio, a cleric would not waste mana to heal me, we rely on others to heal us.<P>With a 1:1 ratio:<BR>Now let's say i cast Covetous Subversion on a cleric twice, i blow 600 mana to give him/her 600 mana.  I am unsure how fast we regenrate mana from meditation, so i'll guess that from meditation L50+ casters get 20 mana per tick when sitting.  Therefore a necro with Lich on would regenerate 40 mana per tick total between the two.  for me to get back that 600 mana, would take 15 ticks or 90 seconds.  in 90 seconds i lose 480 hp (assuming no regeneration of any kind is on).  In this time the cleric has meditated 300 mana plus has the 600 mana i gave him/her for a total of 900 mana, which is enough for 2 Complete Heals, or 1 Ressurection, or 1 Reviviscence.  Now with this ratio, let's go a second round of the above so that the necros hp would be very low and would need a CH and see what happens.  IF we did another complete round of this, then the necro would give the cleric 2 more dumps, blowing 600 for 600, after the 90 seconds, the cleric would have a total of 1800 mana from the 1200 in dumps and 600 from meditation.  the necro would be minus 960 hp.  1800 mana for the cleric is enough for the following combinations:<BR>4 CH's + 200 mana to spare<BR>3 CH's + 1 Reviviscence + 0 mana to spare<BR>2 CH's + 1 Ressurection + 300 mana to spare<BR>1 CH + 2 Ressurections + 0 mana to spare<BR>1 CH + 2 Reviviscences + 200 mana to spare<P>all of this after 3 minutes of medding and dumping 1200 by the necro with the necro at max hp minus 960 from the Lich.  If a cleric blows 400 mana on a CH for me, he would have an extra 200 from the mana i gave him to use for other purposes.  this is advantageous because he doesn't use all his mana that we gave him to heal us.  but then again we give mana to create an advantage.<P>Now let's think here for a minute, with a 3:1 ratio, i have to rely on other healers to heal me because a cleric is blowing all their mana on CH's, and resses.  With the 1:1 ratio on raids, odds are i would still rely on heals from other classes so the clerics could res and heal all the corpses faster.  so the situation has only changed by speed.  whether a cleric CH's me or others heal me doesn't make much of a difference.  we aren't creating an "infinite poll" or mana because guess what no player has infinite mana, therefore there cannot be an infinite pool.  there's basically no difference as to whether a cleric CH's me or a druid regens or heals me while i lich, because if you are trying to say that with a ratio of 1:1 that virtually neither the necro nor cleric would never go oom, then neither would the druid casting regen or heal to keep my hp up tthat keeps my mana up that i give to the cleric that uses it for whoever needs it.  The modifier here is the fact that while we wait to regain mana, we are meditating it back.  by the time i would need another regen or heal from the druid, the druid would probably be full mana again, and i would dump mana to the cleric, the cleric would use the mana, we'd all sit back down, rinse repeat.  with a ratio of 1:1 trasnfer we basicly allow ourselves to cut out the druid, that's all.  what you mean by "infinite pools of mana" exist whether it's druid, necro, cleric or cleric, necro, or paladin, shaman, necro, cleric, etc, etc.<P>therefore your point isn't valid.  the only point of difference between a 3:1 ratio from a 1:1 ratio would be that a 1:1 ratio speeds up the process of downtime.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Want a list of zones where it doesn't work anyway?  Its quite long.<P>So these other classes can give buffs (Druids, Mages, AND Enchanters can all give levitate out, guess you missed that) that we never can and don't WANT to be able to.<P>Mages have the same pet issues?

They can give out mana, without killing themselves (though it does hurt the user...at the same ratio we have.  woo nub need necros!)<P>Druids can heal and not kill themselves.<P>Enchanters give a speed buff and runes (aka reverse healing), also without killing themselves.<P><BR>More wisdom from the Tieny font:<P>Wizards vs Necros spell casting ability to do damage.<P>I'm sorry where were you when Wizards went from crap to 'holy cow I need wizards!'?<P>You know Wizards (and Mages and Clerics and Druids to a lesser extent) all have mass AE and Rain damage spells, right?<P>So assume a mob is weak vs cold [say Talendor], and the Wizard lands Tears of Prexus on him.<P>Assuming no resist, thats 2070 damage for 437 mana, and you think Wizards will be supplanted by Necros with 310 damage (approx 1/7th) for 198 mana (approx 1/2)?<P>What a joke!

Suppose the effect were changed to Summon Essense emerald.

Thats fine, I have no problem with the fact that we are unable to do damage against *boss* mobs.  But why not change the recast time to say....1 minute? Maybe even 2 min.  Is 1100 Points of damage once every Minute Unbalancing? Not at all!  Also it would not intrude on wizard Ice comet and Sunstrike being that it has such a long recast time!<P>Summary<P>Give the Necro Epic effect: Summon NO DROP, NO RENT, Essense emeralds (30 sec cast time 20 sec recast time).<P>Lower the Recast times on the Necro 1100 Point Lifetap spell.  But don't make it TOO short, otherwise we would be intruding on Wizards damage dealing capabilities.<P>Anything completely unbalancing about this?<P><BR>Melkore Magnificent<BR>51st Necromancer<BR>Erollisi Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Let me also make this point clear because i said alot of things, even with a ratio of 3:1 a cleric and necro can still have what you coined "an infinite pool of mana" because in teh example above after 2 dumps i blew 600 mana, i got that back in 90 seconds with lich and meditate and lost 480 hp, the cleric after that same amount of time had 500 mana, 200 from me and 300 from meditating.  he could superior heal me for 580 hp which costs him 250 mana, and he'd still be left with 250 mana, if we went another round, he'd have an extra 500 mana, so you see it's just a matter of speed, we already create mana for nothing, it's called meditating.  when i give 600 of my mana to another player there's no reason why they shouldn't get the full 600.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Mistmorgue:<P>Otherwise... The only problem with making lifetaps 100% unresistable, truly, is the matter of Touch of Night. Deflux and the other lifetaps are all too slow or have a bad ratio that they come nowhere close to the wizard lures. Only Touch of Night is different. So my suggestion would be to make all lifetaps up to Touch of Night unresistable to most of the epic mobs, and make Touch of Night stay the way it is. <P><BR>Ayama:<P>Lets compare the two:<P>Deflux:  3 second casting time (rarely interrupted, only rangers--damn you Maace =)<P>Touch of Night:  6 second casting time (easily interrupted)<P>Deflux:  198 mana for 310 damage.<P>Touch of Night:  405 mana for 720.<P>Ratios:  1.56 vs 1.77<P>Summoning factor:  Deflux will take you about 70 seconds to dump all of your mana in 12 casts for a whopping total 3720 damage.<P>Touch of Night will take you about 45 seconds in 5 casts for 3600 damage.<P>Deflux hasn't upgraded past 310 damage for me yet, but at higher levels it does 330...making Deflux slower but more damaging and amazingly enough you can actually heal people while you are doing it, Touch of Night...you apparently have to wait for a long period of time waiting for the heals to kick in and finish before you drain again, so its just not as efficient in what a necromancer does best.<P>Ayama of Povar, 55 Hereticess<BR>Wanderers of the Stoic<P>http://stoic.aplus.net</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Want to help us with utility abilities on large raids? <P>The following suggestions are based on the unshakable, and undeiable concept that we wont be allowed to add to the damage done on epic encounters. (Its pretty obvious the 12 necros vs Vox back in my hayday had a long lasting effect on the team...) Clerics, save the rants. My necromancer is basically retired, I adore my enchanter. Adding only one of the following would inspire me to play him again, and its awful depressing to put down a character with 140ish days played cause you dont feel usefull anymore.<P>1. Give me a spell that will complete heal my target while taking my life, and sending me to my bind spot with something akin to ressurection effects, put a 30 minute refresh on it to prevent abuse. If its *just too powerfull*, make the component an essance emerald. That way the Tank can choose to give me his xp to stay in the fight, or I can give up my own if the battle is important enough to me.<P>2. Death Pact- before this get hailed as a unique cleric ability, its very in character for necros- and lets face it, clerics have plenty enough buffing to do most of the time. I can see where people would call this a solo want, so make it more expensive and higher level. Hell if you want to be cute with it, make the skeleton illusion fire when it takes effect.<P>3. Is there any way to program a specific resist? Give us a buff that makes people more resistant to fear. I dont know if its possible, but it would make perfect sense that we can counter what we inspire, yes?<P>Asternak Krynus<BR>Caiman Vraen<BR>Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><P>   Perhaps we could just have a useful DD spell like the rest of the caster classes.  My lord, even most healer classes outdamage our direct damage spells; what sense does that make?  We get a level 44 dd (and a 55 that is absolutely and in no way whatsoever an improvement if you are done camping sol b) that is horrible on raids, let alone the boss fight.  If a wizard or mage only got a 500dd and aggroed nearly automatically, they would rub their fingers raw complaining on the forums.  <P>   Other than miniscule damage and high aggro rates, our only useful direct damage spells; don't stack if a necro of higher level casts it first, take a long time for recast, has an effect that gets it banned from any major raids because tanks no likey, has not been loaded in my spellbook to kill anything over level 49, and will never be usefull for anything besides nuking greenies that won't tear me a new you-know-what if I aggro them.<P>  Ok, you likely won't want to give us a new dd for one reason or another, so how about a pet with some hit points or some sort of resists?  Mages get pets attuned to specific spheres of magic, why aren't ours poison and disease resistant, as they have no blood to poison and no flesh to rot?  *IF* fearless pets would unbalance pvp, then release it on the 90% of the other servers who really don't do any pvp.  Just ban them from our test of tactics events then.  I doubt we'd care much, as we are useless there too.<P>   I guess I would just like to know that Verant acknowledges the fact that necromancers cannot do much harm to an ubermob.  Yes, that's only one aspect of the game, but to the players who spend the most time adventuring in norrath, it is the biggest aspect.  We aren't asking for any gifts of power that would make us the uberclass we were in early final, we just feel really bad when we watch all the other classes actually do something to a mob before it kills them.  What did we do?  Lich, send pet, dump, dump, dump, attempt a dot (resisted), dump, dump, dump, recast pet... oops!  Out of mana.  Sit, sit, sit, AGGRO!

</FONT><HR>Although DoTs are how a necromancer did the majority of their damage pre-50, most Kunark mobs die in about 30 seconds once the battle is engaged. Most necro DoTs take over a minute to do full damage. I would like to see the DoTs do their damage in less time. I don't think this would be considered over-powering, since druids have fast acting DoTs and nobody has said that druids are over-powered. However, that's a side note to this issue of the epic mob. <P>Like DoTs, Ignite and Chill Bones does not stack. If one necromancer casts ignite bones, and then a second necromancer casts ignite bones, the second cast does not take hold. Even if there was a way to change Trakanon into a dragon skeleton, it would only make the first necromancer a useful damage dealer. Every other necromancer there would still be in the same situation they are in now. <P>Currently, lifetaps are the only method of damaging a mob that every necromancer present can use that doesn't interfere with any other necromancer there. Although epic mobs may not have a "no tap" flag, I only know of one necromancer on my server who has ever gotten a lifetap to take on a dragon. (Touch of Night on Severilous.) And even then, he's only done it one time. So the "no tap" flag may not be there, but the effect of one is there 99.999% of the time.<P>So what solutions could be offered? How could a necromancer still do damage on epic mobs just like he does on every other mob in the game?<P>Regarding pets: <BR>Well, I do like the no-fear pet idea. However, I don't think that all pets should just be given uber-fear resistance. I like the idea that another poster proposed, having focus items for pets that a necromancer has to find in their adventures. Maybe sleeves that when worn gives the pet a greater fire resistance. Boots that give the pet a greater cold resistance.<P>Perhaps give the pet the same stats and resistances the necromancer had at the time (s)he summoned the pet? Necro strength is 50 and their poison resistance is 200, then the pet's STR is 50 & PR is 200.<P>On damaging the mob:<P>The level 60 lifetap requires an essence emerald to cast. Now, my opinion is, if somebody DIED and lost exp for me to be able to cast this spell, it darn sure should be able to tap anything and anybody. With the recast being ten minutes, nobody will be able to chain cast it. Obviously, you could conceivably get 30 necromancers together and all drain 33,000 hitpoints from an epic mob, but that would also mean that 30 people died for that ability. And realistically speaking, how many times would this situation even occur? Who's going to get 30 level 60 necromancers together to do this on a regular basis? It would be far more likely that they'd get 30 level 60 wizards to cast lure spells instead. <P>As I understand it, lifetaps are all checked on a magic resistance table. At level 24, necromancers have a poison Direct Damage spell. At 44, we have a fire DD. At 55, we have a cold DD. The later two have the annoying illusion effect though. Perhaps we could be given other DD spells of these types at level 60 that don't have the illusion effect. These spells wouldn't have the lower resistances of the lure series, but at least they'd give us the chance to damage the mob. At the same time, other necromancers present could also cast on the same mob.<P>You asked for suggestions, so I'm trying to come up with some. To be truthful, the whole situation is confusing to me. Prior to Kunark I was told that the necromancer paid for their "power" by being KOS by the majority of people in Norrath. With Kunark's release, I was told that being KOS was an advantage and that necromancers had to finally pay for having it "easy" pre-50 by bringing very little to epic encounters. (Obviously, I wasn't told this second part until after I had purchased the expansion.) <P>All I can say in response to that was that it sure didn't feel like and advantage when I was being beaten to death by Altunic Jartin in E. Commons at level 8 while everybody else in the group just stood there and said "That sucks man." It didn't feel like an advantage when my invisibility faded and I was beaten to death by the local guards in whatever town I was trying to sneak through. And it certainly didn't feel like and advantage when I was looking for a group and nobody wanted to take me because I was an "evil" character. <P>In my opinion, any power that I as a necromancer had at level 50 was paid for by all my deaths at lower levels. My group abilities were paid for by me having to convince others that just by grouping with me wasn't going to lower their faction anywhere.<P>I don't know exactly what can be done, but I do know that a lot of people are disappointed with their original class now that Kunark's out. And I know a lot of people, not just necromancers,  who have started twinking up rogues, clerics, enchanters, wizards and warriors. And I don't envy the design team that is going to have to come up with a way to fix it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Another point I wanted to make is this: Every "useful ability" mentioned that a necromancer brings to the raids he has at level 50. <P>* Screaming Terror is a level 24 spell. <BR>* Dead Man Floating is a level 44 spell. <BR>* The level 53 & 56 pet don't have as many hitpoints as the level 49 pet, so against a mob with a damage AE, it's better to use the 49 pet. (The level 59 pet has just slightly more hitpoints than the 49 pet.)<BR>* Summon Corpse can be done at 39. The 57 version uses a cheaper, stackable component. It is more convienient to use the higher version, but the job still can be done at level 50.<BR>* Mana Transfer improves only slightly in ratio post 50.<P>Keep in mind it takes over twice the amount of experience to get from level 50 to level 60 as it does to get from level 1 to level 50. (2.11 times as much experience, actually.) But of all the contributions mentioned, the reward for gaining all of this experience is:<P>* The ability to summon a pet with 200 more hitpoints that does slightly more damage.<BR>* A slightly better mana transfer.<BR>* The ability to summon corpses at half price with fewer trips to the vendor. <P>Other than that, a few more hitpoints and mana points. In my opinion, this reward just isn't fitting for the risk and effort involved.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<BR>In my oppinion I think the Necromancer class is great.  I don't think it should be given anything else.  I do believe one big thing needs to be altered, and that is the fact that Necromancers need to be able to atleast have the chance to do some sort of damage to all "uber-mob" encounters.  It is utterly ridiculous that an offensive caster is banned from doing all types of magical damage to certian high end mobs.  When I say types I mean fire, cold, disease, poison, and cold.  I'm not saying Necromancers should get the abillity to do damage every cast, but atleast have the chance to do damage.  Which is what in my oppinion the Necromancer class is supposed to do.  Offensive Magic!<P>To give an example:  On a nagafen raid with a Necromancer that is below 53rd level.  NO OFFENSIVE SPELLS LAND AT ALL.  Lifetaps are gone because the dragon is immune to magic.  Which is very odd because if they are immune to magic why do shaman/magician resist debuffs land?  Our fire dot, and fire DD are worthless because nagafen is also immune to fire.  Our poison and disease based spells so rarely land it isn't worth  casting them.  If they even do land.  I've personally never tried more then three times.  At this point in a necromancers career they recieve no cold based spells, and I'm willing to bet chill bones is just as resisted.  So what else does that leave a necromancer with?  His big bad skeletal pet.  Send it in... it gets feared... that goes out the window too.  So what are necromancers then left with.. really unefficent mana conversion spells.  Which are spells that are not really even close to what someone with a necromancerish role would be using.<P>This is the BIG concern.. we don't want more enhancements that will make us better in other situations aside from raids.  We just want to be able to use our magical offense in raid situations.  That's all!  Is it really too much to ask for us to be able to do 300 damage with a lifetap on a mob which has 200,000hp in velious?  I mean come on you gave rangers the abillity to do over 10,000 damage with archery... which I recall Abashi stating that it would never become a really useful damage dealing abillity.  I don't get it.. we just wanna do 300 damage and get our hp back so we don't have to give our mana to clerics so they can just use it to heal us because we are liching.  Necromancers are an offensive caster.. we should be able to atleast do some form of magical damage to all "uber type mobs"  even if it is only our 220 damage poison DD.  IT IS STILL SOMETHING.  That's all necromancers really want.<P>Eruditio, and Erudimis on E'ci<BR>51st Druid and 54th Necromancer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I believe I have an idea that will make necros more useful in raids. I do not have a necro of my own, but know enough about them. <P>If necros were given a high level spell that gave them a pet with little or no HP. A pet that was able to cast a spell that did little or no damage, but had the highest taunt in the game. Then a necros place in raids would be firmly secured. Imagine the HPs you could save your tanks and others if you could distract an uber NPC for just 1 or 2 rounds. I have heard that some dragons can quad hit for 200+ HP a hit? This would not increase the necros ability to bring damage against the target itself, but allow the party to stay alive longer, thus dealing more damage. It would give the necro a very nice spot in any raid.<P>There will need to be checks in there to prevent abuse that would end up making raids 10 necros and 1 damage dealing class. Simple things like a cast time and one pet at a time. If there is more then one necro and both cast, then the pets will agro to their own kind. Perhaps a high cost in mana or components so they are only used in times or extreme need.<P>Well there it is, hope it appeals the people who seem to be displeased with necros role in raids. Verant should like it because it does not make the necro any more deadly, only more useful.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The cost of the emerald is to great to make these spells of any use. Let us buy a 200pp or so stackable stone to use these spells and make the spells have a 5 minute recast or something. This would give us the ability to cast atleast one spell during a epic is something other then DMF.<P>Give Necromancers the ability to do Alchemy.

A 500/600 posion based DD at lvl 54ish would give necros something to toss at the mob. Or levle 52 to replace the useless plant only DD. This sould also give Scent of Terris someo more merit to use.<P>I will add that I was very disapointed in the new 50+ spells with the release of SoV. Giving Necros a new DD at 39 was nice, but we need a posion Based DD post 50.<P>Would this make the Necro unbalanced? I don't think so. Would it make them in demand on large raids like wizards, chanters and cleric, nope. It would allow Necro's to be more useful in the fight. <P>ON a side note, please remove Exile Undead from the drop tables of MOB's.

</FONT><HR>It seems that the majority of the problems here boil down to one simple fact.  The necromancer class breaks down if they cannot regain health via taps and that MANY high level mobs resist taps completely.<P>I have a coupld of suggestions:<P>1) Change the resist type of Taps from Magic to whichever is found LEAST on mobs, Disease or Poison<P>2) Decrease the resist rates on taps but leave them magic based<P>3) Here is the really creative one and I'm going to use a bit of simplistic PseudoCode for when a Necromancer attacks a mob via the Tap Deflux which damages for about 310 and heals for about 310<P>If MOB_LVL &gt;= (Player_Lvl + 6) Then 100% Resist ELSE Check Resist<BR>   If Check Resist=True Then MOB_Damage=0 and Necro_Heal=310 ELSE MOB_Damage=310 and Necro_Heal-310<P>In case my pseudocode doesn't make sense, here it is in english.<P>If a mob is 6 lvls or less above the necro, he will ALWAYS be healed based on the power of tap used.  If the spell passes the resist test, then the mob will also have damage done to it.<P>Now..some of you might be thinking...what a coding nightmare, but I don't think so, because this is already how things work a necro Tap-Over-Time spell is active on the mob.  For example:  If Necro #1 casts Bond of Death on the Mob, the Mob is damaged about 800 over time and the Necro is Healed the same over that period of time.  If Necro #2 casts Bond of Death on the Mob while Necro #1's Bond of Death is still active, then the Necro is healed, but the Mob is NOT DAMAGED.<P>Personally, I think this solution is quite clever as it does not add any significant power to the Necro Class, yet allows that class to perform its new support roles efficiently against high-level mobs because it can regain health lost to lich whilst giving mana to others.<P>What Say you...Absor and Others.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Fact is, we do have a role, small as it is, and don't think for a moment that I'm proud to be a mana battery.  I'm big enough to admit that I may have misjudged your first post, but in my eyes, it sure looked like you were flaming me, I'll have to read it a few more times I guess.

Get lost necro..."<P>Did you even bother to read my post?  How about the other 300+ posts before my original one?  Tell me if somebody posted something like that in response to one of your posts that you wouldn't take it personally.  Sorry, but I did.  I never said we were fine as is, I just said we aren't useless as you claim we are.  It's not our fault that people don't know how to utilize us fully.  Necro's aren't the only class that has to deal with this either.<P>There are alot of things that I think could be improved for us.  I'm not going to dwell on it, the issues have been addressed over and over again.

</FONT><HR>I hope somebody can help me out on this one. I've been thinking about this for awhile now.  You ever see another caster who cast that big dd spell that normally would do 1200 damage?  Then have you ever seen them get upset that said spell only did maybe 200 damage total out of a possible 1200?  I have never had a lifetap partially resisted, it's always been all or none.  Why couldn't our lifetaps be made to work like this?  Don't want to make them unresistable, fine, but at least let them do something.  <P>Just remove the all or none flag and let us do something with our calling card line of spells.  I don't know about any of the other necro's, but I think it would make things much better for everyone.

</FONT><HR>Hey, i'm a 47 nec on mith marr. Its fun being a nec, no doubt about it, but it does get much harder at higher lvls. there are a few things i dont understand, one is Absor saying pets are already 'very very powerful'.... this is certainly not true. Pets are powerful in pre-kunark dungeons, like Sol B or Guk, provided you use them right, and are very useful for fear-kiting at lower lvls. In fact, when fearkiting, i wouldnt even use DoTs. They have horrible dmg/mana ratios as it is for the time they take, and with the 2/3 dmg penalty for movement, its just horrible. I think the 2/3 penalty should be lifted for dots, they already suffer dmg on PvP from being player to player. i mean theyre not even doing 50% damage anymore... <BR>As for the lich thing, it totally sucks that the rest of us have to suffer because of a BUG on 3 total servers out of over 30. I would really like a more efficient transfer, or at least a much faster one. instead of 300/100, make it 600/200, and as for the 400/150, if you think on a 55+ raid vs track 150 mana is gonna do something, you're very mistaken. I think a 2/1 ratio is something i can live with. During a bad situation, with the casting itme and mana cost of our current ones, by the time we feed the cleric enough mana for a heal, the tank is dead already.<P>With the 1/1 thing, i think that is actually the way it should be. With your concern over free mana, theres only 1 thing wrong with it. TIME. do you have any idea how long it takes to convert that many hitpoints into mana to actually be useful? Ok the cleric can heal you two hitpoints for 1 mana, but when he heals for 1000+ it takes a few minutes to lose that many hitpoints for it to actually be efficient. Basically during that time he would have medded just as fast with a clarity, not even talking bout clarity 2.<P>However, i dont think you're gonna make a 1/1 ratio, so theres just a few things i wanna ask for:<BR>1. Make the mana transfers a bit more efficient, 2/1 would be nice<BR>2. Make them do more mana at once, you could just add a spell for each lvl we get a new one which transfers like twice as much.<BR>3. Eliminate the recasting delay, it is really a pain in the butt when trying to transfer any mana at all.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hows about this, necros have a nifty spell that's mildly useful on melee intensive battles called Shadow Vortex that drains about ten ac from the target and gives it to the necromancer and is just shy of unresistable like lifetaps. Make an upgraded version of this spell that sucks off say a hundred ac (not really much compared to what an epic mob has) and gives it to the necromancer for the same duration. The thing is it couldn't resist like lifetap or it would be just as pointless to cast. It could however resist like the lure line without endangering the wizard's role as "the guys who can nuke anything." It would also make it very handy to have a necromancer around for high level raids since it is very handy and isn't a dot that will risk the corpse poofing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>After 50 raids are the only reason to play. And getting to boss mobs necros are not awesome but are ok. <P>The problem really is on the boss mobs they are horrible if not a complete waste. Necros are damage pure and simple.<P>You need to create a way for say 4 necros in a 36 player group can do damage to a boss mob. Its not crazy to have them do about the same damage as a ranger with the pet and either dots or lifetaps combined to the mob.<P>You ask for answers its prety simple. Boss mobs should take reduced spell damage. They should not have such hidious resists no one can affect them. <P>By doing this you force uber guilds to have all tanks with the minimal support they can afford to bring to raids. Making mobs have such high mr causes this problem.<P>The solution is simple. Lifetaps and all direct damage (magicians are in the same boat) needs to hit for say half no be completely resisted. Malo and other various things might bring this down even more. <P>If this is unbalancing I sugest giving them more hitpoints to compensate. right now booss mobs need to be tanked making the other classes watch.<P>The difrence is alot of the other classes can do other things. You fixed it for wizards but not for magicians or necros. You also made any hit or miss magic classes useless since they cant affect the mob in any way.<P>The alternative is to make lifetaps do half damage or 30% damage to the mobs instead of complete resists. Lifetaps when they nerfed them  over a year ago were susposed to affect any non red mob anyway. Then the eroding continued.<P>As to making pets useless against boss mobs due to their horrible resists. I under stand both sides. Another alternative would be an exploding pet you cast it, it runs in and gets one BIG hit and explodes. This would help mages and necros on the boss mobs. <P>Necros will never be happy just pumping, its not why i became a necro. I also think you need to fix all the burner classes in this problem.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, so there is a little envy going around, and why shouldn't there?  Many classes have gotten some kind of upgrade or change lately while necros have been left alone.  <P>I've always seen Hybrids to be very useful in groups and raids, but they have just gotten some upgrades, so why shouldn't necros? (I am not saying that the hybrids didn't disserve the upgrade BTW).<P>One point of Veriant is that necros need a downside to go along with their ability to solo to level 50.  If a necro enjoys the game he cannot solo to level 50.  Why you say?  He will be board out of his mind 50+ because he has no friends to go do things with.  <P>50+ necro turn into support characters.  I have no problem with this.  Make me a support character, but make me more useful then a mana/DMF pump.  DMF cannot even be used in many places.  DoTs are just burning mana on raids, chanters refuse to work around pets, so we are left with support.  <P>We have Screaming Terror, but a chanter will take care of that area.  We have healing spells, but that's a cleric/druid job.  We have a buff (DMF), but that is only worth a little on a raid (Useless in many raid zones).  What are we left with?  Lich and mana transfer.  <P>This brings me to 2 suggestions.  <P>1) If you intend on keeping our raid job as only Lich/mana transfer, make it faster please.  I'm not talking about ratios; I'm talking about the amount I send over.  With the recast time and the small amount of mana sent, mana sent over is not very useful to a raid unless many necros are there (which brings up connection and organization problems).<P>2) If you are willing to adjust our abilities, I would be thrilled to see a new buff for necros to cast.  Death Pact may be inline with the necro character, but I'd like to see a buff that would give Melee a proc of some kind like Vamp Embrace (the way the spell works, not the general effect of it).  You would have to make this spell non-useable on pets or remove the lifetap proc from our 44+ pets in order to retain balance.<P>Either way would make me feel more useful to a raid while not making us overpowering solo.<P><BR>Thanous Soulbleeder<BR>55th Pre-Paineel Erudite Necro<P>PS  I shouldn't have to put up with downsides of the necro after having to start with my guild in Tox, bad sight, and NPCs that don't care for me.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, <P>Your not taking into account the element of time.  Longest fights usually only last a min at most.  Even with the best lich, you cant fill your mana to full in that amount of time.  Really you cant take the hp drain into effect, since a high lvl regen will negate most of the effects.  Really lich is a more effective clarity (about 1.75 better if you dont consider the mana required to keep us healthy).  All this would do would give us the ability to use our mana for any spell in the game.  Although I disagree that this would give you a infinite mana pool, it would give you a very powerful way to get mana and use it more effectively.  A transfer of 30 percent is unacceptable, it should be at least 50 to 60 or better.  Although this is a mute point since, we should be damage dealers not mana batteries, Necromancers embody death itself, are you saying that death can not even remotely effect High lvl MoBs.  Also if you are going to make a Lifetap cost the life of a 45+ player, then it should be completely and totally unresistable.  It shouldnt be on the same lvl as lures, for that cost it should be on a high lvl that lures.  With its recast time and cost it will only be used once during a fight anyway.  <P>I just hope that you realize that something needs to be done for necromancers post 50.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The good news is that Verant been at least attempting to hear our cries.  I've read what Absor is interested in hearing about, and hopefully he will be interested in what I have to say, both from personal experiences/examples as well as a lvl 60 necs standpoint.  <P>On corpse poofing, no I haven't seen any 55+ corpses poof since I can remember, level 51-54 mobs is a different story.  A little over one month ago my guild was in hate and we pulled maestro to Inny's lair single. We were not exactly ready for him and there were mainly "1st time" raiders there, they didn't have their video settings turned down and about 10-15 of the 36 went LD.  Maestro poofed end of story.  The code to make LD people auto attack is great, a lot better than going LD and just sitting there, but in any case maestro is pretty hard and seeing his corpse poof was an indication to me that this bug does still exist.  You seem to be aware that the dot / FD bug still exists, and if not it does because that happens all the time in places like Mistmoore.<P><BR>On the lines of necro usefulness at high level, especially on raids yes we are among the weakest and least useful. To even consider pets as a valid form of damage output is wrong. Pets die easily in a few hits/ae on raid level mobs, or even on juggernaut raids in Sebilis, or any mob that becomes enraged (mob ripostes every hit). So in those situations, our pets are useless. 53 and 56 pet have around 1200 hp, which is pretty weak, but the damage they do is decent I suppose. While the 59 pet is a slap in the face for becoming a level 59 necro. We spent what...45 played days to get from 51-60 and our reward was a pet that has potential to 6 more damage and loses to a 49 pet half of the time? Isn’t there something wrong with that? Increase the damage...increase the hp...We don't care as long as somehow the pet is made more effective... a 49 pet in spectre form simply isn’t an upgrade.<P>After a while being a mana battery gets very old, why can't I life tap or cast any spell on these dragons/ubermobs. It's kind of demeaning that I can cast on Cazic Thule and Innoruuk but not on my friend’s FA dragon Ragefire..I send pet in, it dies after about 25 seconds, and then I twitch the cleric of all my mana, then step away because I can't do anything. Anything...partial resists, a spell that has horrible mana ratio but will have a chance to land... anything would be better than being completely useless on raids. Which brings us to the mana battery discussion.<P>It seems Verant has decided that a necros purpose in EQ at high levels is to be a mana battery. If we became level 60 to be a mana battery then so be it. But please, give us spells to do it with. 3 to 1 ratio has been shown to be useless to the point where it is ten times more desirable to just get another cleric.  In all truth the 56 subversion spell isn't nearly effective to do the job as a mana battery. It has a recast time... Bad ratio..If we're going to be mana batteries then please give us a decent ratio. Please... Another post on this thread showed the consequences of increasing the ratio, ultimately ending in less downtime. I'm going to stress that if we do not get some sort of upgrade to mana transferring then the discussions on this board is useless. Something needs to be done, Verant has stated mana batteries are the desirable job we have post 50. This is the case, now it is time for Verant to let us do it.<P>Something needs to be done about necros job post 50 it's demeaning and sadly makes me very angry that I've spent months of my life in this game to end up useless just because I was good at soloing in the earlier levels. How bout giving us a spell with a reasonable ratio.. If we can't get a decent mana transfer spell, then how bout making the level 49 lifetap have a chance to land for partial/full damage. The spell is slow...horrible ratio...certainly not overpowered but a valid way to let necs regain their health. If you won't let us do damage then please come up with an innovative way for us to help out on the raid, allow infusion to be cast on others..Anything. If all of these suggestions are unacceptable or serve no purpose here is my final suggestion.  <P>*/plead* Defoliate/Defoliation are to be replaced with a new line of necro mana drain spells. Level 29 and 52 Defoliate are to be removed from the game and become spells lvl 29 Curse of Ervaj, and lvl 52 Hex of Ervaj (after the new bard mana drain line, names just an example) each would have reasonable recast time, and drain a max of 100 mana for lvl 29, and 300 for lvl 52 spell. /cheer Necros will have something to do on raids. And  although the spells will not be the greatest or as good as bard/enchanter mana drain lines, we will have the ability to contribute to the raid.  The level 29/52 spells make up for the 8 useless Kunark spells necros get, as well as ability to be desired at raids. The threads are closed, necros rejoice. Which is the purpose of this thread.<P>A few notes on Lich for Absor :<BR>Lich does not take 32 hp, it takes 26 hp.  You claimed we get a hp to mana ratio of 1 : 1. Were you mistaken on this or are you sure? Demi lich is 48 hp for 30 mana supposedly, 48 hp for 48 mana seems like a lot. Or were you referring to 48 hp * 33% = 16  48 hp - 16 hp (for pvp coding) = 32 hp.  According to this demi lich gives 32 mana for 32 hp and lich gives 26 mana for 26 hp /shrug just food for thought.  <P>One final idea from the far side : Necs have 4 outrageously useless spells. Sacrifice, Convergence, Trucidation, and Infusion. I've never used one of them because not only are the spells completely useless, but in order to obtain the components that they consume it's incredibly costly. If Verant refuses to take them out of the game then why not make this simple change to solve this. Instead of requiring one emerald to cast sacrifice, and in turn getting one essence emerald. Why not make Sacrifice consume three emeralds, and produce three essence emeralds. Change the consumption on Convergence (the resurrection spell) to three essence emeralds. Now I'm sure many necs like myself would actually take these spells seriously, and possibly use this spell. This way Convergence would still be powerful and would still require somebody to lose experience. But on the other hand, the useless spells like infusion, and trucidation might actually be used. Sacrificing somebody for a 1100 point life tap simply isn't worth it, neither is 1000 mana. If you get three emeralds from one sacrifice it could definitely change how the spells are looked it. Possibly make Trucidation the high level low resist necro dd that allows us to cast on uber mobs? Possibly make infusion give more mana as levels increase from 55 to 60? So at 60 we get 1500 mana, at 55 we get 1000? Make it castable on others?? I'm just throwing out these suggestions because I don't know anybody who actually uses this spell arsenal and that's sad that we have 4 useless spells<P>Velespio 60th Necro of Tunare<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>While this will probably get me flamed badly, I have to say it.  Most of you are arguing the wrong points.  After all is said and done...necros are different.  They always have been.  When I go on a raid to an uber mob, I never expect to get in there and deal out some massive DD damage.  The DoT bug is a serious issue, but I see very few of you complaining about that, only that we can't DD effectively - which is not what a necro does, it never has been, and never should be.  If Verant would fix the corpse poof problem (for real..) then necros would be helpful.  Don't gimme this 20 second battle crap.  I've been on about 30 Trak raids and I've seen him go down in 20 seconds and I've seen him last 2 minutes (scary).  But if we could use our DoT's without fear of the bug making the corpse disappear, then we'd be truly helpful.  So you can't DD-tap a level 63 uber mob?  Tsk Tsk.  Then save your mana to do those 42 corpse summonings that usually come after a raid.  Or feed the clerics some mana.  It's what we can do, and nowadays, any practical raid-leader will recruit help for his/her raid with these things under consideration.  As far as I'm concerned, necros are NOT broken for the most part.  Where I see true problems is in our post 50 spell listing.  We have way too many spells that will never be used for 1 reason or another.  I will list those (like I always do) for Absor because he seems to not see, not understand, or not care (hope this isnt true) about them when they are listed elsewhere... here we go:::<P>1).  Defoliation - Either give us another spell or put in something we can kill with this spell lol.  It's like having undead DD's and Verant takes out all undead that are higher than 35th level.  OR make this spell work on things that are in the game (mushrooms in Sebilis comes to mind...duh, the plant-type mobs in Wakening Lands, etc).  Otherwise this spell is a waste of space.<P>2).  I never really understood the purpose of undead only Fear spells (Dread of Night being the most recent).  No necro that I know actually bothers changing Fears for their mob-types, since regular Fear works rather effectively on everything.<P>3).  Undead charm line - great idea...for a non-pet casting class.<P>4).  Infusion - Until the reagent on this spell is lowered to simply an expensive gem (say a regular emerald or amber or something), there is No way in the Nine Hells that any sensible being would choose to waste time with this spell.  I'd rather die than use this spell.  That way I could use the essence emerald to rezz myself (which I'd HAVE to do only if a cleric wasn't around) instead of wasting someone's "soul" to give myself 1000 mana that may or may not save me and that I'd get back in 90 seconds ANYway with Lich on.  Never been used.  Never will be used.<P>5).  Levant - nifty spell once you figure out how to use it - but the night only portion of it remains a huge hinderance and keeps me from the benefit of its purpose (same goes for Skin of Shadow).  These spells are 1 page away from Infusion...<P>6).  Quivering Veil of Xarn - Occasionally, I simply stand in front of my computer screen in awe at the utter stupidity behind the creation of this spell.  The idea is a great one - Upgrade to Harmshield.  However, this spell will NOT work if you have any kind of regen on at the time, this spell will NOT work if you have any kind of damage shield on at the time, and most importantly this spell will NOT work during the day AND it has a 10 minute recovery time just like the first Harmshield so ...er...what the heck are we supposed to do with it?  At level 58, you are almost always grouped with someone who'll put a DS or a regen on you.  And why would I give up Harmshield (usable all day long) for something that might tell me "This spell can only be cast at night" when I'm being beat into a crimson stain.<P>7).  Trepidation - this spell needs some serious work.  I used it for about 10 minutes after I got it, until I realized that it's nowhere near as effective as Invoke Fear.  2 things could help this spell  a).  Increase it's duration significantly , OR b).  Lower it's mana cost significantly.<P>8).  Trucidation - Another example of something that will never be used due to the cost of the much coveted essence emeralds.  No one will bother with this spell as the 59th tap (Touch of Night) can be used for NO reagent, no recast time, less casting time, and does 720 damage.  I mean guys, I've had a total of 4 essence emeralds since the release of Kunark.  Do you think I'd use this spell or Infusion??  Nope.  Nobody has, nobody should, nobody will.<P>9).  And this is more of a question.  Why are Demi-Lich and Arch Lich the same level?  I mean the spec illusion is neato-mosquito but I believe in efficiency just like the next guy so Demi-Lich is the one to use.  I have Arch Lich ready to scribe when I hit 60 (in less than 2 bubs) and I am also concerned about whether it will stack with DMF (Arch Lich has see invis in it - so does DMF)  Even if Arch Lich had levitate in it with the see invis, I'd hate to give up the poison resist just to look like a spectre.  Anyway, there's my coverage of the necro-sage =)  Have a fabulous day everyone.<P>Jeddia Seltarineo - 59th Defiler - Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The_Perfect_Flaw, let me take you back, over a year ago, when taps were TOTALLY unresistable.<P>I was in on the first clearing of Snad Giants in the Oasis, with a all necro force. It was mighty fun to have a team of 16th to 20th lvl necros. <P>Then, months later, when people really hitting 50th lvl, and the dragons were being killed for the first times, necros COULD tap! Yet, no one EVER excluded wizards, since the damage that wizards can do, for the short term, way out damage necros. So, even though necros could tap, wizards allways had a spot.<P>Then, VI decided that necros were having too much fun, and made it so uber mobs were un tappable.<P>What does this have to do with what you posted The_Perfect_Flaw? Even when necros could tap, they never replaced wizards, and never will. Most uber-mobs are dead in under a minute or 2, and thus, a wizard can go full burn, and do a great deal of damage.<P>As for suggestions for necros for Alan<P>- CHANGE THE EFFECT ON THE UBER ITEM- either a ultra-fast casting dark, with a lure like resist, or a tap, or maybe make it the top necro focus item.<P>- ALLOW TAPS TO LAND ON UBER MOBS! As it is, the uber mobs, no matter how you de-buff them, or how close you stand, are un-tappable.<P>-Maybe give necros and MAGES a spell at 50 and 55th lvl that is a pet only buff, that make pets at 50th, un-fearable, and at 55th, allow pets to be damn near immune to AoEs, or anything other than a physical attack on the pet. The reason being, pets are very hard to keep alive for necros or mages, and the pets are vastly out damaged by tanks now, with the Displ they get. So, why not allow the 2 main pet casters to use their pets, and not have to chain cast them when fighting uber mobs.<P>-REMOVE the skell illusion of Ignite and Chill bones. Granted, I LOVE to have it known, when our DD lands, but not at the cost of pissing off all the tanks.<P>-Quivering Veil of Xarn should NOT be night only. Any spell that takes 10 minutes to mem, and is a escape spell, and is night time only, well, it is  a sad joke.<P>-Either change, or REMOVE Infusion. For a essance emerald, the spell is worthless, and, since it is castable once every 15 mminutes, well, any caster at the lvl you get the spell can med for more than that mana.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I really think the skely illusion of ignite/chill bones needs to be removed.  In a single group with one necro it's no big deal, but in a raid with 30+ people and mulitple necros is where the problem is.<P>Necro #1 lands Ignite/Chill Bones and then the other necros have to wait til the illusion wears off to recast.  Many times one or more may waste mana as theirs gets off a sec late and you get the "your spell did not take hold" message.  The illusion annoys the tanks as in a big battle they can lose track of what's a pet and what's a mob.  The coolness factor wore off after about 10 mins after I first got it, so either keep the illusion but let another ignite or chill bones hit or remove it entirely.  As it stands now this spell is practically useless in a large raid situation.  If Alan should respond to this post, I play a necro and you admitted you don't know much about necros so trust me, on raids this spell is nearly useless.<P>Now as for some of the other comments that Alan said about how to make spells more useful, it's simple.  Make necro spells that useable ONLY in the planes.  Just like in some zones Dead Man Floating doesn't work such as: Kedge (where it should), the Hole, etc.  Make a set of spells that are useable only in the planes (hate, fear, sky, growth, mischief).  Covetous Subversion (? spelling) is give 100 mana for 300 casting cost.  Could make, say, one thats give 250 mana for 400 casting cost.  Again would be unable to cast anywhere BUT the planes.  This one solution as in the "real" world we are the same as before but in the "other" worlds where our dots cannot be used and neither can our best nuke, we get something to compensate.  This wouldn't affect anything in a non-raid situation.<P>Yes please make out pets immune to normal fear.  If you want to have a mob that casts Panic the Dead that's fine, fear away my pet.  Actually while you are looking at pets my suggestion is dump the 53 rogue pet and 56 monk pet as I still use the 49 warrior for the simple reason that it lasts longer in a fight.  Just make the 53 and 56 regular warrior types ok?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044793-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044793.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044793-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044793-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044793-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044793-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=044793&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=044793&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
