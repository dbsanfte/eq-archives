</FONT><HR>Miss, miss, miss, hit, miss. Raise our weapon skills post 50. You don't have to make them equal to that of a Warrior's skills, but at least enough so we can hit more often.<P>Epic! Why not make our epic have a new effect (I don't mean a new proc, although it's kinda lowsy). Give us a choice between 2hs, and 1hs and a shield. Not exactly 2 ending quests, but maybe right clicking on the sword to change them back and forth from 1hs and shield, to 2hs. It's also obvious that the 2hs should outdamage the 1hs, but the defense from the shield should also make up for this loss in power.<P>Divine Might II. Give us an upgrade to Divine Might. There's no reason not to, and it was also planned in the Velious expansion, although it never happened. This proc would really help us out in dealing damage, since our weapon skills are often not good enough to hit anything.<P>Stuns. Ok, so you killed stuns in uber Velious mobs, after all, it is supposed to be for experienced players. If we can't get our stuns in, then maybe you can give us a spell that taunts mobs, better than stuns, and does some damage. Our Jolt with the opposite effect. Since paladins and SKs are supposed to be meat shields, then let us take the damage we are intended to take.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Greetings my fellow Paladins, and thank you for taking the time to listen to every class's concerns and ideas! It is VERY appreciated.<P>My 2cp.<P>First.. please fix Flash of Light. It is currently bugged so that after a mob is blinded and begins to walk away, if the person blinding it gets in melee range it will still aggro and attack you even though the spell has not worn off. A blinded mob should not be able to see you... basically, this is our version of fear kiting.. not as effective as a true fear spell.. but I use it quite alot.. unfortunately after I blind a target all I can do is sit and wait while the rest of my group goes after it due to this bug.<P>#2 - Please raise the Bash skill level. I truly prefer sword and shield over 2hs. And most Paladins, even if they prefer 2hs, will switch to sword and shield against casting mobs for the interruptions..<P>#3 - Please, add more OBTAINABLE 1hs to the game. For both SK and PAL. While we have some pretty good ones currently, they are exceedingly rare. I recently looted a Sprinkler in Hate to give me something better than a Ghoulbane, but under the circumstances it looks like this will be the best I can do for a long time because of this rarity.<BR>Preferably 1hs weapons in the 17/30 area, if not better.<P>#4 Please, please, please.. an epic class 1hs! Same for SKs.<P>#5 As mentioned many times before.. reduce the reuse time of LH post 50.<P>#6 Reduce the recast time on the DW Bracer. The use of it's stun effect if pointless due to the looong cast time. 8 seconds to cast would be nice... making the bracer more useable than the current time, but not overpowering it.<P>Well.. that's all I have to say. Regardless of what ideas you decide to use from these posts, I sincerely thank you for listening.<P><BR>Karrik Trueblade<BR>49th Circle Paladin of Tunare<BR>Leader of Dii Minores<BR>Quellious<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I don't believe that making paladin spells available at ealier levels is a good answer. This will only overpower paladins in the earlier levels. Our buffs are balanced at the level we get them, assuming that there isn't a cleric present in the group. <P>The problem is a stacking issue, not the strength of our buffs. If we had buffs of comparable strength to the ones we have now that stacked with cleric buffs, it wouldn't be nearly as much of an issue. Then of course, you start to run into the 15 buff limit. &lt;shrug&gt;<P>Offense<BR>paladins have no dual wield<BR>paladins have lower skill caps in offense and weapon skills<BR>paladins have a lower damage table than pure melee classes<P>These 3 things don't have a cumulative effect, they have an exponential effect. Paladins currently have the lowest damage output of any class against MOBs with average MR. Maybe this is by design. I honestly don't see this changing, although I do think 2 of the defincies listed above should be enough, there isn't a need for 3. Alternatively, high end weapons that aren't designed for dual wielding can be finally put in the game for paladins. SKs have the MoSS and the Ebon Mace, but paladins really do not have an equivalent weapon. <P>Please consider raising the bash skill for paladins until it is closer to the cap for warriors. It's kinda your job to figure out how high  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Defense<BR>I'm not sure paladins should have a defense skill as high as Warriors, maybe very close, but not the same. I will reserve judgement until I see the results. I realise that warriors have higher AC items available, have more hp, and have defensive disciplines. On the whole, in ordinary xp grouping situations, we tank just fine. It is only in the big game hunts that we lack tanking ability. Some sort of discipline that allowed us to tank better for a short period of time would probably do more to even out this balance without making us tank TOO well in ordinary encounters.<P>Special abilites and spells<BR>Stuns are the bread and butter of paladins. Stuns are one of the primary benefits of adding a paladin to a group. In the planes, they are the main benefit of adding a paladin to the raid. Our damage output is neglible, but our ability to interrupt casters is unrivaled by any other taunting/melee class. <P>Stuns are essentially our defining role in the high end game. At least it used to be. Now there are many MOBs that can't be stunned, can't be interrupted, or both. Other melee classes are asking for the ability to stun now. Warriors got stunning kicks with ROK. I believe monks got a kick that will stun with ROK. Rogues were asking for an ability that allows them to stun. Stun NEEDS to be made viable for the paladin again. It was our primary niche. Please allow stuns to interrupt casting on MOBs over 55 even if it does not actually stun them. Please do not hand this ability to more classes.<P>LOH should be a complete heal post 50. I can't think of a single balance reason why it should not. There are items in game that allow for complete heals with no mana usage. Having one complete heal every 72 minutes for 50+ paladin would not be unbalancing. On the other hand, LOH is simply not the defining skill it was in earlier levels. Now that a tank will regularly go through 3 or 4 times his normal hp in a single, normal encounter, LOH becomes less and less of the "OMG! you saved my butt!" type of thing it was in earlier levels. Now it is "oh, you used LoH on me? err, thanks. Was that after the 3rd complete heal?"<P>Heals for paladins can't really be made more efficient for paladins for balance reasons, I think most paladins deep down know this. The healing role of most paladins in raids and groups at higher levels is drop a heal or 2 on someone to buy time for the cleric (read as: real healer) to heal them. We don't need better or bigger heals, we need faster heals. Even if that means they are much less efficient.<P>Please consider giving paladins the yaulp 4 spell. We desperately need some kind of atk buff. Any kind of atk buff. I don't know if you realise just how pitiful paladins are in the damage department. <P>recap<BR>give us a defensive discipline INSTEAD of making our defense cap the same as warriors.<P>Get rid of the quadruple whammy on paladin damage: offense, weapon skill, no dual wield, lower damage tables.<P>Raise our bash skill slightly.<P>Let us interrupt 56+ caster MOBs with our stuns and bash.<P>Faster heals.<P>Stackable buffs? Maybe yaulp 4 instead? or Yaulp 5  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

We should be better than them on defence.<P>We are defensive hybrid,as absor said.But I think we are imposed enough handicap.We can not DualWield,We do not have any damage dealing spells except Frame of Light,like piss and too rare.<P>There is one data.A level 60 monk's damage dealing data using 3 type weapons,hitting level 60 SDK on his back.<P> Runed Fighters Staff(19/20) 1437.52dmg/min<BR> Tranquil Staff(29/30) 1372.56dmg/min,with 4 time 120dmg procs<BR> Sarnak Warhammer and Stave of Shielding(9/20, 17/28)  1448.49dmg/min<P>29/30 or 19/20 weapon for paladin is not exist.Our best weapon is 35/40.On the other hand,9/20 or 17/28 weapons are common in RoK or SoV world.From these datas,it is obvious that DualWield can deal 120-130% and more damage than 2hander that can get same levels.Lacking DualWield is enough handicap to be "defensive", isn't it? Why Should we be patient almost less 50% damage dealing ability than warrier?<P><BR>We are defensive hybrid,as absor said.But Greater Healing is obviously underpowered in post-50 world.Our healing ability comparing with ranger on one cast is about 4 times better,but at lv57,It become twice,though they have nuke,Dualwield,Archery,sperior offensive descipline.And Shammy and Dru can cast SHealing at lv51,with less fizzles,and get remedy.Isn't it relative nurfing about our healing ability?<P><BR>BTW,warrier's triple attack is too powerful.I think it had better be removed, or should be given to all fighter class.<P>Sorry about my bad english,Thx for reading.<P>Mondo<BR>Level51 Paladin<BR>Veeshan server.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Paladins Spells (what we get for not being warriors) are nearly 95% useless in a high level situation with a Cleric present.  In the post 50 game, you can't do anything without a Cleric. (ok fine you can, but it's unfairly difficult.<P>Give paladins spells (of the SAME power they are now) that are USEFULL (i.e. stack with, or affect different things than) their parent class: Cleric.<P>Why are Shaman and Druids better healers than Paladins?  They are Purebreeds, but Paladins are *Part* Cleric.<P>Paladins *and* Shadowknights have a horrible time taunting without unloading agro generating spells on a mob (and thus not fighting, which still occurs, albeit a small ammount less with that new patch on clock resetting).  Since Taunt = Damage, 1h / 2h limits with pathetic bash ability is not enough to be able to taunt.  It's a horrible insult to the Paladins *just fine* high AC...nothing hits ya, ya might as well be nekid.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Make Soulfire Bash enabled - Wurmslayer is a far superior weapon and far easier to get.<P>Lay Hands is pathetic.  Clerics can Complete heal 500 times in the time it takes for Lay Hands (which heals LESS) to recycle *once*.  Instant cast, no mana is nice, sure, but 500:1?  And Donal's BP does it mana-free every 30 seconds (possibly up to 3 *times* to the same target in the duration of Lay Hands recharge)?  Please.  Defining ability...heh.  Try again please.<P>If Paladins and Shadowknights are forced to use a shield (for vision(TM) purposes, because I picture SK's with poisoned daggers...) Then please make bash *usefull*.  More damage, better shields, ability to interupt more than level 20 wimpy casters, and stop putting stun-disable on 99% of mobs over level 20 except when they run.  Off-hand weapons work ALL the time.  Bash should too.<P>Raising Paladin defence cap to warriors is a mistake - LEAVE warriors as the kings of melee.<P>Just make Hybrids more group desireable.  The whole concept of "group effect" spells was pure genious!  Spread the wealth.<P>Sorison</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Mana cost should be in the 3-4hp/mana range and cast/recast times remain the same.<P>Move Superior Heal down 2 levels to stay balanced with druid/shamans changes and replace the silly Celestial Cleansing proposal with this improved WoH.<P>Enstill is NOT an upgrade to Root Absor.

</FONT><HR>How will hybrids be more desirable if we are to keep the same unbelievably low skill caps?  Why won't they still be king of melee after Rangers are as fully offensive as them, and Paladins get a bit closer to a Warriors defensive level?  You can't have 'balance' when you have one class as the 'king'.<P>Lay Hands isn't going to make your day to day Experience group better or more balanced.  At Level 60, I have 1977hps naked, 2323hps with full gear - Lay Hands heals 2600 hps.  More than enough to use for that rare occasion you use it as a stop-gap measure to save your group's enchanter or cleric.  No other class will ever get CH other than a Cleric, we're not going to get it as part of our trait any time soon.<P>I don't want a better heal spell just because Druids and Shamans got a better upgrade than we did.  Along with balance, you now have 3 classes able to keep up with low-end (i.e. = non-CH) and quick heals, why add a 4th?  Two classes built purely on spell casting shouldn't be matched by a 25-33% Cleric, a.k.a. Paladin.  I would rather we focus our energy fix this huge disparity between the 1st Rank Tank, the Warrior, and the 2nd Rank Tank: Everyone other melee.  We once were regarded as the second best tank, you know?  We've long lost that status with ROK and POST50, which most would like to bring back.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I was looking forward to catching up to the group's Druid healing ability. But now, the Druid will always be ahead. Why?<P>Rangers are the hybrid of druid and warrior, and yet can cast spells that druids don't have. Paladins do not get to cast any spell that the cleric parent class doesn't have. Why?<P>I want a PET!  Yes, I know I said the evil words. I don't want a familiar, I want a lousy pet.  I want a dumb dog to follow me around and I can name him and stuff. It could be a level 1 pet forever, but what harm does this cause? Make it like a real pet amd make it so it doesn't really listen to anything you have to say unless you feed it... Yeah, I would prefer if the pet was a horse to fit in with the whole paladin theme, but dogs are already available in the game... <P>I want to be able to give away the items I can summon.  Yes, they are crap and no one will use them, but it might make them useful just before a group corpse recovery. And handing out a halo to someone would be just plain kool! Other classes can give out better items, so we're not stepping on toes of other classes. <P>And lastly, Paladins should be allowed to have the surname "Bastardinho". Ok, I don't post often, I struggle with congruity.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>BASH:<P>Paladins want to use shields we don't get duel wield and the shield sorta conveys the image of the night in shining armor, carrying his sword and shield (with the symbol of his order painted on it) So increase of bash, since it the paladin's who claim mastery of the shield in combat we should be on par if not better then the warrior with it.<P>Also a few paladin only shields would be great with various effects and procs unique to paladins. I would like to see special shields for each of the paladin religions that bear the mark of their God. (ie a shield for Tunare, Marr, etc.) so that only a paladin of that order  could wear it. This idea is based on the image of the paladin in his armor with his sword and shield, painted with his religion's symbol.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First I want to say thank you for the changes on test.  They go to help us alot.  In fact they took most of the wind out of Paladins sails as far as fixes go I would say.  I do have a few things though that I would like to bring up.<P><BR>First-  BASH....   Paladins use bash for 50+ lvls daily.  We are one of the few classes that use this skill often.  Yet we don't have the max skill in it.  If we were to get 250 or 252 in bash it would add to our attacks but not so much to make us powerful damage dealers.  It would just be a small thing that would seem to make sense from a gameplay perspective.<P>Second-  SHIELDBLOCK....  Why is it that when you hold a shield you can not use it to block an enemies attack?  A shield is a defensive weapon, yet in the game it is used only for an offensive attack.  There should be some sort of added skill that you get when weilding a shield that gives you a chance of blocking an attack.<P>Third-  QUEST SHIELD....  Referring to shields again.  I know this is a wish more than a balance issue, but it would be nice to see a shield that can be quested that will reflect your diety/class.  Paladins used to be the only class with a epic type weapon graphic and now all the classes have them.  It would be nice to atleast be the only class that has a epic type graphic on a shield.  Something to show who we are.  I am not saying that the shield should be uber awesome.  Just that it be a nice shield (around dragon/planes loot maybe) that has a graphic on it.  Something that we can do around 50'ish or so maybe.  It would be really nice to see our Fiery Defender able to break into a sword/shield combo or be combined to make the 2hd, but I doubt that would ever happen.  Would be nice though.<P>Finally-  PROC ON FIERY DEFENDER....  Why is it that the proc on our EPIC sword (the best sword we are supposed to have) can be resisted?  I can understand that damage not being full everytime, but the stun should be unresistable.  This is our epic wpn I mean.  I am not implying that it should be a stun that lasts 10 secs everytime.  I am just saying that everytime it does proc the mob should be stunned.  That would make this a truly epic weapon then.  <P>Well that is my 2cp worth.  Hopefully it will help in some way.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Many posters have already mentioned how the paladin stun spells need to be made more useful on 55+ mobs.  What I suggest is to make a new stun spell that is pally only, this spell would be a lure line spell so it would be almost completely irresistable, BUT it would also work on all types of mobs such as giants, juggernaughts, dragons, gods, etc.  As everyone knows or should know by now, stun is a very good taunt but it also interupts spell casting.  For this reason there are many groups that camp the myconid king that make sure they have a good paladin for stunning the adepts and priests (those CHs really hurt).  But if paladins had a lure line stun spell (dmg and stun duration debatable) that would work on all mobs I'm sure that groups and raids would be looking for pallys to join them.  The way you could make sure this would not unbalance the game mechanics (i.e. chain casting) would be to put a recast delay on it but it doesn't need to be something horrid like 1 minute.  I think somethin like a 30 second recast time for such a spell would be about right that way you would have to get about 10 palys in a raid in order to chain stun an uber mob assuming it was a 3 second stun, but they would have to practice in order to sincranize it that well.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Dang it I got so excited about finally being able to post on this topic I forgot a few things.<P><BR>CRITS VS UNDEAD..  We should be doing crits and crips against undead from day one.  Even if you only hunt undead it will not help that much, but add alot to gameplay aspects.<P>DISCIPLINES...  Give us some sort of discipline that will make us useful on a Epic encounter.  I was with my guild taking on Vaniki and Paladins have nothing to offer in this fight except loh'ing the primary warrior before he dies.  We need some sort of discipline that we can use in a situation like this.  Anything would be better than the nothing we have right now, and there are some very good suggestions on the previous posts.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hehe, I guess Alan didn't realize that by putting paladins and rangers to the end of the list he actually gave us more time to type up postings and SAVE them to disk, bideing our time before posting  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif">. Good thing I saved mine, as I see many others did!<P><BR>Changes to the paladin class:<P>Un-Nerf 1H weapons?:<P>Paladins are supposed to be the most defensive class? Using a shield and sword, stalwart defender's of the Faith? They want you to take up a 2H weapon, take the total offensive, forget you are supposed to have the ability to wield a shield and be more useful to your group with a 4x increase to your output. Or you must seek the Wurmslayer, the only balanced 1H slash available to Paladins because of it's delay over 40 and look like many other Paladins: indistinguishable. Please restore the 1H damage bonus to it's original bonus, the same as 2H bonus. There are many 2H weapons out there that have the same stats as many 1H weapons, and yet they are not computated like 1H weapons for damage/delay purposes.<P>If you are un-willing to restore 1H slash to it's former damage bonus, consider making a simple database change of paladin 2H quest weapons to 1H weapons. Their delay is 40 or above, therefore they will not change their current amount of damage (i.e. it won't nerf their damage) but allow use of a shield again, because we are supposed to be a defensive class, which brings me to my next point.<P>Most Defensive Class:<P>It's obvious you would never change our damage output it's not in our classes 'Vision™'. So why don't they raise our defense, parry, riposte, and dodge skill caps to the same as a Warriors? We still won't be doing the damage of a Warrior, no wheres near it. Besides, all the other hybrid/melee classes outdamage us by a good margin, so why should we not have better defensive traits that would set us apart from the others? (note: this was written before the changes on Test Server were announced, and in light of the fact they have not gone into production, it's still a useful point. ShadowKnights will have the same defense cap as we will, which will undermine our status as the most defensive hybrid and tie us with shadowknights for AC and defense; yet ShadowKnight spells will still give them more offensive ability/damage than Paladins, perhaps a riposte/parry/dodge increase will affirm our position.)<P>Maybe put in a ability for Paladins, starting around lvl 30-40. Sacrafice - When a Paladin targets a PC and activates the ability, the targetted PC cannot be affected/harmed by physical attacks for 30 seconds. All damage and stuns are transferred directly to the paladin for the duration of the ability. It would say "(name) sacrafices (him/her self) in defense of (target)".<P>Undead Damage:<P>We are the melee slayer of the dead? I think not! Warriors get Critical Hits vs. Undead ALL THE TIME! Even Paladins don't get Critical hits vs. the Undead all the time, only 2 mins at lvl 55!!! (Ok, so I'm being a bit misleading, but then again, I'm talking on a Verant board, so it should be understood; Warriors get critical hits vs. anything that moves all the time, so inclusively they get critical hits vs. undead all the time.) Ok, back to the undead. <P>Paladins should have criticals vs. undead since lvl 1, rangers have crits on bows, SK's could get crits on summoned/animal/plant stuff. <P>Can't give crits verse undead as an innate ability, not just a discipline? How about hit for max damage every swing vs. undead  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"><P>Symbol of Pinzarn is a useless buff at the level you get the DeepWater BP. Change it to a Banish Undead or higher undead DD spell. We know you won't change it to Greater Healing, but we wouldn't want that anyway, it might end up with a 15 min recast time on it. <P>Switch the effects on Ghoulbane and Dawnfire(maybe)? Perhaps raise the DD on undead proccing weapons for pallies?<P>Reduce all undead DD's a paladin spell level? e.g. dismiss undead at 39 instead of 49. At level 39 clerics already have Expel Undead, so they still won't have parity with Clerics. Verant would never give parity with clerics, and they never should, so this would be a good compromise.<P>Possibly make Lay of Hands, because of it's healing and life-giving holy nature, a undead DD for the amount of it's normal healing.<P>Clerical Spells:<P>Face it, EQ is a grouping game. And with groups will inevitably come Clerics. At higher levels, it is almost imperative that Clerics be in groups. For Paladins, it is imperative that they can find a group. But why would a group choose a Paladin over a Warrior, they most likely already have a cleric. What does a paladin bring to a group, that makes him as worthy as the warrior? It certainly is not his healing, nor his buffing, because the Cleric overwrites it all in everyway. Because clerics are EverPresent in groups, they effectively strip the implied balance of spells+melee, for a paladin, away when in the group. They reduce a Paladin to a sub-par damage dealer/taker with spells of little worth, which is why there is growing popularity of Warriors as the ONLY tanks. Maybe a group would take in a paladin if he offered something to a group that a Warrior could not possibly offer? As it currently stands, when a group has a cleric, warriors simply offer more than a paladin can. <P>Perhaps allowing ALL spells of a certain rank to be used, when said rank that be reached. For example, at lvl 30, allow ALL lvl 14 cleric spells to be used by paladins; It would not really upset the current spell list, as almost everything from Revive to Greater Healing follows the appropriate spell ranks already<P>If you can't justify that, make it so that Paladin AC HP buffs stacked with clerical buffs? It would easily fix the problem. Warriors will bring great defense unto themselves, but the Paladin could offer great defense to the ENTIRE group. <P>If you can't justify HP AC buffs, why not Undead only damage shields with 20 dd per hit at lvl 30; 30 dd per hit at lvl 50; 50dd per hit at lvl 55? Something along those lines please; we don't want to end up with some crappy 5 dd spell that WON'T be used and WON'T help balance the class because it's not being used because of it's uselessness.<P>One would think that if Force is a level 34 Cleric spell, that means lvl 52 is Paladin Spell rank for Cleric 34. Superior Healing, where for art thou?<P><BR>To Summarize:<P>-Fix 1H slash damage.<BR>-Change Paladin quest weapons to 1H (simple database change) so we can use shields again.<BR>-No change to Paladin offensive skills or damage output, but make defensive (defense/parry/dodge/riposte) skills a lot higher.<BR>-Criticals vs. Undead from lvl 1, not just a discipline.<BR>-Lower Paladin undead DD spells a Paladin spell rank (e.g. Dismiss from 49 lvl lower to 39 lvl).<BR>-Maybe put Banish Undead on Deepwater BP.<BR>-Possibly make Lay of Hands reverse if targeted on undead and do undead DD for the regular amount it would heal.<BR>-Have Paladin buffs stack with Clerical buffs.<BR>-Allow ALL clerical spells of the appropriate rank to be used (e.g. all lvl 14 cleric spells at lvl 30 for paladins, all 24 cleric spells at 39 for paladins)<BR>-Undead damage shields that are more damaging than Magi/Druid damage shields of about the same levels (they obviously have a more limited usage, so they should be VERY useful when they can be used)<BR>-Possibly make Superior Healing a lvl 52 spell (not really high on my priority list, but a friend suggested it)<BR>-Get rid of the 15% mana penalty for hybrid casting, we already are penalized by not having the specializations.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First off i applaud anyone who has managed to read all the posts so far and is still reading them in their entirety!<P>Most of my concerns have already been addressed by many others. Just a few comments i would like to add.<P><BR>EPIC:<BR>God i hope you look at the proc again. Its sorry to say the least.<P>Ive always liked the look of 2handed swords, but i like wielding a shield as well. Ghoulbane was a GREAT sword, a 2handed looking sword you could wield with a shield. Thats the vison i have of a paladin. Fiery Defender with shield would be the perfect look in my mind. Remove the AC off of fiery defender and let us equip a shield with it. I dont think it would be very hard to code this; you could simply have the server allow shields to be equipped with any bash enabled sword. You could simply make FD 1 handed, but i dont think that will happen, and it brings up other issues. But just removing the AC and allowing us to equip a shield with it would be perfect. Wouldnt even have to alter the ****ty proc. Damage output would be the same; all that changes would be an increase to our defense, were a defensive hybrid afterall, i dont care much about increasing our offense(we could use a lil help here, but id rather see more defensive options). There are only 3 bash enabled swords in the game, fiery avenger, fiery defender, and the sk epic. Allowing all 3 of these weaopons to equip a shiled with them would not be unbalancing.<P><BR>STUNS:<P>I really do think the team needs to look at our stuns. Post 50 the biggest thing we lose is our ability to stun or more importantly inturrupt npcs. <P>What i would propose is a new unresistable inturrupting stun. The spell would have a 0.0 second stun component so it would not stun an npc but it would inturrupt their spell casting. Make the spell work on ANY npc, add a recast delay if you want ectra, or better yet just make it take like 500 mana. One of the most frustrating things is fighting an uber mob knowing you can do NOTHING to stop it from gating, or CHing, ectra.<P>Or, instead of a new spell, how about giving paladins/sks at lvl 60 the CHANCE to inturrupt ANY npc with a successful bash.<P>DISCIPLINES:<BR>Along with the stunning issue, the only other major issue with lvl 60 raids is our complete lack of disicplines. Yes i know we have 4 of them, all useless! Take them all away and give us one good defensive type /disc; make it a watered down vesion of the warrior version if you want, something... Doesnt even have to be defensive, just defensive oriented. There have been many good ideas posted on this.<P>Or along with the stunning change above, how about a /disc that makes all our successful hits in a certain period of time inturrupting blows, that work on ANY npc. Say 20 seconds or so.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>(charts at the bottom)<BR>One thing I would like to address is the inconsistency in AC of the Armor of the Paladin versus the warior's since the kunark expension. <P>Prior to the expension, things were in line, but since then it seems like a few pieces of armor are not in line with the rest.<P>The basic fact is that all pieces of the paladin armor should be the same or similar percentage of the warrior armor (e.i. all pieces of the armor set should be for example 17% less AC then the warrior or there abouts, all pieces of the set should fall within a reasonable range).<P>I would suggest that the AC on the Paladin Armor (and others that exibite a similar unatural variation on some of the pieces) be slitly increase to be brough more in line with the rest of the set. (Along with that increase the rate that Cobalt drops at, it is way too low)<BR>(One could note that the Ro Gauntlets have AC that is not in line with my argument and I am all in favor of lowering the AC of the Ro Gauntlets)<P>Specificaly (and raise Velious Armor accordingly):<BR>Deep Water Gauntlets: raise the AC to 21 (still less then the AC of 25 of the Warriors but now 16% less ac then warriors as apposed to 36% less AC then warriors right now.<P>Deep Water Greeves: raise to 30 AC to be 14% of Cobalt as opposed to current 26%<P>Deep Water Bracer: raise to 17 AC to be 15% of Cobalt as apposed to current 25%<P>Again the idea here to to make the whole armor set consistently less then warrior (just like quested and planer armor) and not randomly have AC on 3 pieces out of wack for no apparent reason.<P><BR>Demasus<BR>Brell<P>-----charts-----<P>| AC of the ""quested"" armor<BR>|<BR>------|__Ro__|Cobalt|Difference|<BR>|Arms_|_11AC_|_12AC_|____8%____|<BR>|Chest|_20AC_|_22AC_|____9%____|<BR>|Feet_|_11AC_|_12AC_|____8%____|<BR>|Hand_|_12AC_|_12AC_|____0%____|<BR>|Head_|_13AC_|_14AC_|____7%____|<BR>|Leg__|_13AC_|_14AC_|____7%____|<BR>|Wrist|__9AC_|_10AC_|___10%____|<BR>+-----+-+----++-----+----------/<BR>|Minimum|__0%_|<BR>|Average|__7%_|<BR>|Maximum|_10%_|<BR>\-------+-----/<P>|AC of the ""planer"" armor<BR>|<BR>------|Valorium|Indocolite|Difference|<BR>|Arms_|__16AC__|___20AC___|___20%____|<BR>|Chest|__30AC__|___35AC___|___14%____|<BR>|Feet_|__17AC__|___20AC___|___15%____|<BR>|Hand_|__13AC__|___15AC___|___13%____|<BR>|Head_|__17AC__|___20AC___|___15%____|<BR>|Leg__|__17AC__|___20AC___|___15%____|		<BR>|Wrist|__10AC__|___12AC___|___17%____|<BR>+-----+-+-----++----------+----------/		<BR>|Minimum|_13%_|<BR>|Average|_16%_|<BR>|Maximum|_20%_|<BR>\-------+-----/<P><BR>|AC of the ""Kunark"" Armor<BR>|<BR>------|Deepwater|Cobalt|Difference|<BR>|Arms_|__21AC___|_25AC_|___16%____|<BR>|Chest|__40AC___|_45AC_|___11%____|<BR>|Feet_|__21AC___|_25AC_|___16%____|<BR>|Hand_|__16AC___|_25AC_|___36%____|<BR>|Head_|__21AC___|_25AC_|___16%____|<BR>|Leg__|__26AC___|_35AC_|___26%____|<BR>|Wrist|__15AC___|_20AC_|___25%____|<BR>+-----+-+-----+-+------+----------/<BR>|Minimum|_11%_|<BR>|Average|_21%_|<BR>|Maximum|_36%_|<BR>\-------+-----/<P><BR>|AC of the ""Velious"" Armor"				<BR>|<BR>------|Runed Protector|Champion|Berzerker|Difference|<BR>|Arms_|______19AC_____|__24AC__|__24AC___|___21%____|<BR>|Chest|______42AC_____|Unknown_|__47AC___|___11%____|<BR>|Feet_|______21AC_____|__25AC__|__25AC___|___16%____|<BR>|Hand_|______15AC_____|__24AC__|__24AC___|___38%____|<BR>|Head_|____Unknown____|__24AC__|__24AC___|___NA_____|<BR>|Leg__|______24AC_____|__34AC__|__34AC___|___29%____|<BR>|Wrist|______15AC_____|__19AC__|__19AC___|___21%____|<BR>+-----+-+-----+-------+--------+---------+----------/<BR>|Minimum|_11%_|<BR>|Average|_23%_|<BR>|Maximum|_38%_|<BR>\-------+-----/<P>Sources:		<BR>Caster's Realm http://eq.castersrealm.com		<BR>Allakhazam http://www.allakhazam.com		<BR>EQlizer http://www.gameznet.com/eq		<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Tho you did not say, noted and we'll work on that on every suggestion, which I agree some ideas are a lil farfetched *Horses* etc.  You were fair and honest with us.  Thank you for that!<P>I for one am VERY Happy with the ideas of the following:<P>Have Paladins reguarly undead critical hits/blows<P>Offer a Solution for the Paladins that wish to change their Epic Weapon into a 1H Slashing / Shield Combo. *Quest,something not to complicated as if getting our Epic was not enough  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">* We are clearly the shield classes along w/ ShadowKnights.<P>The mention of spells/discs, also are wonderful and would love to see what you responded on put live!<P>Another thing I would like to suggest is Armor,  Paladins currently do not have much choice as opposed to the other classes.  Currently I am wearing Valoirum/Deeepwater.  Other classes have the option to go planeshunting and to achieve higher armor class/stats and look then we and a few other classes do.  If people can exceed their Armor in PoG, then we should be able to go somewhere and do the same.  The suggestion here is Plane of Mischeif.  To my reccolection PoM is not currently itemized.  This would be a great time to add the armor for the classes who do not have the luxary as PoG classes.  Another thing to talk about is Location/Difficulty.  Currently, PoM is hardly achievable.  With it currently where it is *do not want to post spoiler info* It is highly unfair for the classes who are not picking up armor at PoG which is not difficult to enter.  The location needs to be moved.  Currently the plane at its place now is almost impossible to get to.  Please look into this.<P>I think others have summed up the rest that need looked into Thank you for the response and we are all looking forward to whats to come of this.<P>Darkfiend Lightbearer<BR>55 Knight of E'ci<BR>Follower of Na Koa<BR>Proud Wielder of The Fiery Defender!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>On the prior list that turned cannibal  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/eek.gif"> I had a detailed list of drops (Karnor's Castle was the example) I hope you at least vaguely remember it. We need more weapons available to us that are similiar to the ones the other tank classes have, and have them drop off similiar level Mob's. This would greatly help those of us that play at off times and don't have the time or resources to go on "Raids" to kill dragons and Gods.

</FONT><HR>Personally I think our "Epic weapon" could use a revamp. <P>- 1st: We get no good extra items in our epic quest like other classes<P>- 2nd: They just keep stacking more parts onto quests that we have. Instead of making original quests<P>-3rd: Goes for Paladins and SKs. It'd be better to get a 1hs weapon + shield. We're the only classes that mainly use shields since we can't duel wield.<P>-4th: Fix the hilt!! It doesn't look right beating up something with a hilt.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Armor of Ro:<BR>The faimed armor of Ro, is in need of adjustment. the risk/reward for the Armor of Ro is way off., let me compare this to the warriors crafted armor. For example, this one piecec of the armor quests, the breastplate;<P>Crafted Breastplate: AC: 22, Sta +5, HP +25<P>Get werewolf Tallon from Mistmoor (ball room), turn it and three rubies (bout 600pp value) to someone in south karana <P>Breast Plate of Ro:  AC: 20,  STR +4, Sv Fire +10<P>-Get good faction with temple of Rolusek Ro<BR>-get cauldron for making ronium alloy<BR>-Get good faction with Dwarf's cleric guild<BR>-get fairy dust, do Soil of Underfoot quest<BR>-kill a sand giant, to get sands of ro<BR>-get rare drop melitite off clock work gnomes  in sol-a (destroy gnome faction)<BR>-get 2 bars of enchanted platinum<BR>-get mistmoor granite from gargoyles in mistmoor (inside castle)<BR>-get 2 cauldrons from mistmoor (kitchen)<BR>-turn both cauldrons in to person in rathe mountains to get mold, combine the other stuff to make a bar of ronium, put both in forge to make the breastplate of ro<P>the 2 items are somewhat comparable, (the crafted has a higher AC and higher stat increase), however while the crafted one is fairly easy and straight forward to get, requiring the warrior only to risk his life once to get the werewolf tallon, the paladin has to risk his life repeatly needing 3 items from mistmoor, one from sol-a and again fighting sand giants. As well the paladin has to build his faction up with 3 different groups. the result most warriors get a full suit of crafted at a fairly low level, and only a few paladins get some of the pieces of Ro Armor. (not to mention that crafted can be resized)<P>the solution is that either they need to make the Armor of Ro easier to get, or more preferably they keep the quest as is (since it is a good challenge) and improve the Armor itself, <P>What I would like to see to make the armor worth the time trouble and risk:<P>BreastPlate of Ro:  <BR>AC 22, Str +5, Wis +5, Sv Magic +10, Sv Fire +10<BR>Bracer of Ro:<BR>AC 10, Str +5, Dex +5, Cold +10, Fire +10<BR>Vambracers of Ro:<BR>AC 12, Str +5, Wis +6, Mana +50, Dis +10, Pois +10<BR>Boots of Ro:<BR>AC 12, Dex +5, Agi +5, HP +35, effect spook undead<BR>Greaves of Ro<BR>AC 14, Sta +6, sv Cold +10, sv Magic +10<BR>Helm of Ro:<BR>AC 14, Wis +8, Cha +8, sv Magic +10<BR>Gauntlets of Ro:<BR>AC 12, Dex +6, Str +6, Poison +10, Disease +10<P>you get the idea.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I've only seen this touched on just breafly by darkfiend_eci but the paladin planar armor in my opinion is another balance issue.  Pre kunark and in the early days especially (after all the bugs were worked out of plane of hate) it became evident that hate was to be farmed and farmed and well you get the point.  Well the biggest problem with that was both warrior and cleric armor dropped there and both are necessities for raids no matter what.  Fear on the other hand was a challenge to break and people were expected to lose levels when they did fear raids so as a result people (other than classes whose armor drops there) did not want to do fear raids including warriors and clerics.  <P>Now with the launch of velious you have again placed warrior and cleric armor in the same plane and yet again the plane that drops their armor is terribly easier to access.  The risk factor is less as well and on top of that warriors and clerics are an even bigger necessity than ever before.  Then it turns out that plane of mischief is located right outside ToV (spoiler on this was released almost 2 months ago) which means anyone desiring to get there has to pass through THE MOST DANGEROUS zones in game (aside from maybe veeshan's peak and sleeper's tomb).  <P>If I have to fight my way through siren's grotto, dragon necropolis, western wastes, and temple of veeshan just to get to the plane my armor drops at this better be some seriously phat loot.  Not saying all this is required but can you think of any other way?  I don't see anyone having to work so hard to enter plane of growth, and if clerics and warriors both have their armor in growth (bards, monks, rogues, mages, necros, chanters, and shamans also) then depending on guild charters they may decide they don't want to ruin their faction with Bristlebane. <P>The biggest damage dealers in the current game all have planar gear in growth, by the time mischief starts becoming remotely raided will there even be a need to go there (i.e. another expansion with increased level cap and new armor/spells) or will most high levels be retired and happily playing their twink or a different game?<P>There is no way in veeshan's belly that people are going to let anyone level 46 to 52 even think about coming along either and anyone 46+ is able to enter planes.  You've made one plane a farmers market and the other plane a mercedes dealership only it doesn't matter which you go to you get the same quality product.  That is not very balancing at all and the clerics and warriors NEED to have their planar gear in seperate planes so that there is not any reason to debate which plane is raided over the other.<P>Also for valorium drops in fear they average about 1 to 2 drops per raid whereas shadowknights rangers and druids average about 4 to 7 drops per raid.  Think you could fix these drop rates to make them a little more balancing also so that certain classes don't walk away with a full suite of planar gear and others only get a bracer that drops almost half of the time?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I still like the horse pet Idea, or at least an summon or illusion spells that makes it appear that they're on a horse, and increases speed some? Although I think as far as balance goes it should be a controllable pet that can attack (kick, bite etc) and if it can be ridden, perhaps a chance to hit the horse instead of the Paladin, based on riding skill? Sort of a little bit extra damage sponge. Then there's also the possiblity of lances getting increased attack when riding horse (perhaps also based on riding skill) or maybe even lances only usable on horses. <P>I for one like the idea (why I'm posting it =) but perhaps comment on why it is or isn't a good one?<P>Thank you.<P>Dernhelm<BR>Paladin of Underfoot<BR>Saryrn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Damage:<P>Paladins can stand their own in front of a mob, not as good as  a warior but well enough. however paladins are pathetic as far as dishing out damage, in fact the much vaunted paladin comes in dead last when compared to the other melee classes and by such a margin that it's embarrasing. (well to be fair i should through  the SK in with us at the bottom of the heap) Warriors, monks, Rangers and rogues all out damage us by an incredible margin.<P>so please please please please please please please please please please.......Increase the amount of damage that paladins dish out and not just at the higher levels but all the way through.<P>I don't think paladins are asking for much, we just want to do at least comparible damage as a warior does with the weapon in his off hand. Paladins don't get dual wield, criticals cripling blows, minimum damage, beserking etc.<P>Raise our Offence skill caps<BR>Raise our Weapon skill caps<BR>Raise our Damage Tables, give us minimum damage<BR>Raise Bash<BR>Raise Archery  (75 is too low to hit the side of a barn)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Another thing with reckless str i know this works say i cast it on myself if i time it right i can remove the buff before getting the negative effect and recast to constantly getting the positive effect. I would say fix this so it can't be removed like i think it was orignally suppose to be. How bout giving us a Superior heal upgrade at lvl 60? Last but not least lets move some of the yaulp spells we get yaulp at lvl 9 and then yaulp 2 at 39?!?!?! thats 30 lvls. move yaulp2 to lvl 22, yaulp3 to 49 and top it off with yaulp4 in the high 50s.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1. Divine Favor, although good in idea, is a bit below snuff in actual usage. Mobs in post 55 encounters can eat 150 damage up easily in one round. Recommend to up the damage that it can absorb to 500-700 but would only last as a buff for about 10 seconds. Everything else about the spell is good.<P>2. Wave of Healing, as above, 200 hitpoints can be easily eaten up in one round with a mob attack or even a mob AE in a post 55 ecounter. Recommend to up the healing from 200 to 500 per person, for an increase in casting cost from 450 to 500-550. Yes this makes the spell very mana efficient, but only in larger groups, which encourages grouping. Everything else about this spell is good.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I posted on the corrupt thread so I will repeat briefly just in case you missed it Absor.<BR>To reiterate:<P>1) The current epic weapon effect is too weak for the end-all paladin weapon.  It is resisted a lot and pales compared to some other classes weapon procs on DROPPED weapons (aka non-epic weapons)<P>2) Paladins are the main shield users (with SK's) Why can't our Fiery DEFENDER be a defensive item? Perhaps a 1h slash with shield option?  At least give it a defensive proc.<P>3) Nagafen and Vox cap has made it insanely more difficult to finish the epic quest one you pass lvl 52.<P>4) Main paladin ability would be the stun/interrupt on mobs yet both are rendered ineffective on 55+ mobs<P>5) Need a big raid discipline.  Currently, Paladins are NOT invited to big raids for any reason other than they have friends there who show pity.<P>6)Lay on hands at 51+ needs to start having its recycle time delayed.  Treat it like a discipline.<P>7) More 1h weapons made for non-dual wielding characters in mind.<P>8)ALL HYBRIDS should get bind/gate around lvl 60. Its a huge ability of our parent class and I think we deserve it for making the lvl 60 goal (give it a 2 minute cast time or something and self only bind.  Just make it a convenience ability not something to save us from death in battle)<P>9) Increase the bash skill. Right now it does MAYBE 25 damage on the high end and an average of around 12. Perhaps let us get critical bashes at lvl 50+?<P>10) Holyforge concern.  Currently we can critical hit undead for 5 minutes every 72 minutes.  I seem to average about 3 critical hits in that time for an average of about 250 damage TOTAL.  How can 250 damage every 72 minutes do anything?  Warriors have an innate skill to critical hit all mobs,  Why can’t paladins have this at lvl 51+?  We would be able to randomly critical hit undead mobs at all times lvl 51+.  Do this and replace the 55 discipline slot with a big raid discipline =)<P>Hope that was a good refresher on my post.<P>Talenvor Ruglia<BR>57 Paladin<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>3. Personal thought to make paladins useful at large scale encounters, while retaining the melee ablity to the warriors, monks and rogues. Give paladins at level 45 an immunity to fear. At level 55 have the paladin make his/her entire party immune to fear. This would give the paladin a roleplaying skill, along with usefulness. If immunity is too great, then make it so the paladin ups the groups chances of not being feared.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Same with SF, see point 2 below.<P>2. Soulfire.  By the time I was able to obtain it, I had better.  Even pre Kunark, I rarely saw a Paladin wielding this weapon.  I upgraded to a Nathsar shortly after getting SF.  I'll use an example.  Sol B:  I could solo any of the greater kobolds, and some of the sol kobolds using the Nathsar.  SF was so slow, I'd get the crap kicked out of me before I could do enough dmg.  It's listed on Everlore as a level 50 quest item.  I'd say probably closer to 45, but it does take quite a bit of help from friends who aren't worried about killing FP faction to help with this.  But even at 45, there are much better weapons obtainable.  What I would like to see is a class defining weapon that I will actually use before (and if I ever) get an FA or FD.  This kinda goes back to point 1 above.  Would love to see a 1HS that I could get before Planes, and still be able to use after.<P>3. While the improvement to the defensive caps are nice, I never had any complaints about defense.  Offense on the other hand... here's an example:  Fighting Inny in PoH, I never hit him one time at level 48 with 2HS maxed out.  Then I was promptly G-fluxed to no-mans land.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> 2nd example:  I think I hit Vox a total of 5 times, and I lived till she was like at 25% life.  Kinda seemed pointless for me to be there other than to enjoy the 2 hour wait for CR.  I think you get the idea of where I'm going with this.<P>4. Undead spells.  Very rarely do I see Paladins post 40 even using these.  I wield and Arb. Combine Great Sword with FBSS.  Add and Enchanter haste buff in there, and I lose damage potential by taking the time to cast.  Even before I had the ACGS (pre 49), it was pointless then to cast Expulse Undead for 64 dmg.  You could do that much or more in melee during the casting time.  Dismiss helps a bit at 162 (assuming it hits for full dmg), but the jury is still out for me on whether it's even worth casting.<P>5. Disarm.  Heh, was this supposed to be funny, and we missed it?  Please raise the cap on this, or simply remove it.  I don't think I've ever met a Paladin who uses it.  Sometimes I'll go to Nek and pick on the guards (which are green for the most part), just to test the worth of Disarm.  It's worked a grand total of 1 time.  And trust me, I've killed my fair share of DE and Freeport guards.<P>6. Armor.  Don't really have a complaint in this area, but here's some thoughts on it anyway.  Ro armor is great at the level it can be obtained.  Around 30 I'd say if you have help.   Between 40 - 45, before you can reach Planes for Valorium or Kunark for DW, it seems a bit lacking.  My suggestion:  Make Ro armor a bit easier to obtain, maybe a piece or 2 obtainable in the 25 - 28 range.  Put in another quest doable at say level 40 or so that is an upgrade.  Include turning in the piece of Ro armor plus whatever else as part of the quest.  Just an idea.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Ok, so it was more than a couple of points! This ended up being WAY longer than I had intended.  If you read this far, thanks for your patience and time.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Over all, I'm very happy with my Paladin.  I enjoy playing her very much.  These are the main points where I think we could really use some improvements though.  <P>Linale Kinderhearte<BR>49 Paladin<BR>Crescent Dominion<BR>Quellious<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As a paladin and having checked out advantages of OTHER classes I'd like to point out a few instances of weakness.<P>***Paladin Balacing vs other Chars<P>#1. Paladins vs Shadow Knights<BR>In these types of encounters Paladins are at a disadvantage due to one thing - Fear Kiting is much more effective than our methods of rooting and healing. I would suggest some sort of quick-casting self only heal similiar to Yaulp might counteract this.<P>#2. Paladins vs Most Casters<BR>Paladins should get Resist to Magic spells at lower levels. At level 40 just a few nukes from a wizard and we die a rather quick painful death.<P>***Individual Spells<P>-Stun, recast time is too long. I realize that you can't have chain stunning as that is just unfair. But stun really doesn't do much. Interrupting one spell that can be immediately re-cast does't work well. Perhaps giving paladins an ability such as kick would help. Using a 2h weapon means you can't bash, this is a disadvantage in the long run.<P>-Divine Purpose, *NO COMPLAINS!* Very nice addition to our line of spells! Thank you verant! (I think that's a first)<P>-DD Spells, adding a few lower level DD spells would be nice. I'm not talking anything big... Lvl 9 gets a 25pt dd, level 22 gets a 50pt dd.<P>-Add a 'fearless' spell. Against classes who can fear kite we are at a severe disadvantage. I would suggest adding a buff that reduces chances of being feared. A spell that reduced chances of being feared by around 25% would work EXCELLENTLY in ballancing these encounters. Righteousness (Spelling?) would be a good name on a side note! <P>-Add See Invis sometime around level 30. Advantages are being able to see those nasty casters who like to invis and nuke out of no where. It would balance class vs class matches and not necessarily effect leveling and NPC battles in any way.<P>***Soloing technique<P>As I mentioned earlier, in comparisons to other classes Paladins are lacking in our solo capabilities. We are not as bad off as some classes in the soloing area. But compared to some we are HORRID! My main thoughts being- FEAR KITING. <P>Shadow Knights have the ability to fear kite, being the exact inverse of them we should get something that would allow us to counter this. My spell I mentioned earlier would work VERY nicely at doing this.<P>I also think that fixing our root/heal technique would be good. At level 39 our heal is VERY mana inefficient! (For me at least) One fizzle uses a large amount of the blue stuff and a successful cast takes the larger part of a bubble of my mana. My wisdom is pretty high also, for other not so wise races this could pose a serious problem.<P>*** Post 50<P>Post 50 paladins are very very well adapted to handle almost any technique while still being fair in the 50-60 level ranges. Job well done on this!<P><BR>Just my two silver. If anyone has any comments feel free to e-mail me. These boards can get hectic and its often hard to check follow-ups.<P>-Nitrus<BR>40th Holy Knight of the Mystic Dawn<BR>Luclin<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Damage output:<P>The damage output by paladins is pathetic, even embarrassing. We are severely out damaged by every tank (cept the SKs which are in the same baot in this area). Monks, Warriors, Rangers and Rogues vest for who can produce the most damage while the Paladin's only melee acomplishment is "I can bash to interupt casters" paladins don't get Dual Wield, Criticals, Beserker, Cripling Blows, Kick, minimum damage etc. <P>Our lack of offensive abilitys directly effects our desirablity for groups. for groups seeking massive amounts of melee damage (rogue backstabing etc), paladins just don't measure up. while paladins shouldn't be combat gods, they should at least be able to do their fair share of the work. After all, even if paladins had the same skills and abilities as the warrior, we would still only do half the damage (no dual wield)<P>-Raise all Offensive skill caps<BR>-Raise weapon skill caps<BR>-Revamp and Increase our damage tables<BR>-Raise Bash</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
