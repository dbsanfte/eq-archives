</FONT><HR>Ok, let me state what I *think* the intent is, and then talk about repercussions.<P>  There are a couple of dungeons where certain race/religions are not KOS to inhabitants.  A tactic is, before a big raid, park some lvl 1 members of this race/religion near the dungeon so that if the party gets wiped out, you can log in the secondaries and go get the corpses with no risk.  I assume this is the kind of thing that Verant is trying to overcome.  <P>Repercussions: Me, I play a rogue - one of the classes best suited for corpse retrieval.  The rogue community typically provides the service of corpse retrieval to other players... we do this because it helps us overcome the distrust and/or misunderstanding of the rogue class that makes it difficult for us to find groups.  Brad has stated that Rogues need to find ways to roleplay through this distrust... and we're o.k. with that.<P>  I strive to keep my faction up with all cities possible in the game because I never know when I'll need to sneak into one of them.  Since rogues cannot gate or teleport, we tend to use the cities nearest to our hunting grounds for supplies.  Faction is important to being able to do this.  <P>  The outcome of this new rule, if not implemented correctly, is that I will be less inclined to help another group drag their bodies away from a failed combat because my faction will be affected.  That means rogues will begin to "pull away" from one of the services they can provide to the playing community - which negatively affects both the community and the rogues.<P>  My hope is that faction will only change if detected.  In other words, if a rogue is hidden and sneaking, and can successfully drag a corpse away without the mob noticing, then faction should not be affected.  If the mob detects the rogue and attacks... well, that's just like combat and if the rogue can zone before the mob is killed, faction should not be affected.<P>  I guess we'll see how it is implemented, but I would request that Verant speak with the rogue representatives in their programming groups (Kendrick and Vaslin come to mind) about this before putting it in place.<P>Thanks,<P>-Le Chevalier Blanc<BR>Barbarian Rake of 51 winters, Erollisi Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, here's a bit more information.<P>The idea is that there are some places where, with a good faction, characters can travel unharmed.  Some of those places are very, very dangerous to those that are not aligned with the folks that live there.  These will be major adventuring/hunting zones for those that don’t mind not being able to wander around free there and talk to the locals.<P>We really like it that way, but setting things up like that leads to a simple problem.  Folks that are hated by the natives can make assaults on them and have their 'friends' who are well liked by the locals simply drag their corpses to safety, right in front of the people they were trying to kill.  There are other potential abuses of this situation that I won't describe…<P>So, to maintain the risk of fighting in these difficult places, we had to have these mobs get upset when you drag their kills off.  And, yes, rogues and invisible types will have to be a lot more careful doing their recoveries once they actually lift that corpse up on their shoulders and start to scamper away.<P>You will not have a problem dragging your own corpse (at least not any more of a problem than you would normally have).  So if you accidentally fall to your death and you are friendly with the natives, you will be able to drag your own corpse all over the zone with no additional problems.  But then, you won't need a safe spot either…<P>This will make corpse recovery a little bit more difficult in the few places where this rule is used.  But we see this as a necessary and useful inclusion.  We wanted to tell you about it before hand to help reduce the number of people surprised by this addition.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Yikes!<P>Correction on my last post.<P>Dragging a corpse will not make you more visible.  So if the creature sees through invis, it will still see you dragging a corpse.  If it does not, dragging a corpse will not increase your visibility to that creature.<P>Sorry for the goof on that.  Hopefully I caught it fast enough.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It is understood that if you are attacked and defeat the mob, you would take a faction hit.  But the question that I'm seeing asked and not answered is whether you take and actual FACTION HIT by merely dragging a corpse.<P>Can I, for instance, have good faction, but hightail it to the zone, dragging my buddy's corpse, and assuming I zone safely... have I lost faction with the pursuing mobs, or does zoning clean the hate list and I'm back to being best pals with them when I zone back over?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It is understood that if you are attacked and defeat the mob, you would take a faction hit. But the question that I'm seeing asked and not answered is whether you take and actual FACTION HIT by merely dragging a corpse.<P>Can I, for instance, have good faction, but hightail it to the zone, dragging my buddy's corpse, and assuming I zone safely... have I lost faction with the pursuing mobs, or does zoning clean the hate list and I'm back to being best pals with them when I zone back over?"<P>There is no faction hit for dragging a corpse.  You can do exactly as you suggest in your last paragraph with no loss of faction.  And I'd consider you a brave and foolish friend for doing so.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>Realisticly, dragging a corpse from an area should raise your faction with the residents.<P>For example, a group of 12 try to take on a Silver Dragon and die horrible, aweful, and ugly deaths.<P>Now Joe Smith, who has excellent Dragon faction, wanders by.  He waves at the Silver Dragon, who nods back.  They exchange pleasentries.   How's your wing these days?   Sky treating you find? Good to hear, good to hear.  Hey, I notice you have all of these dead bodies here.. surely the smell must be getting to you... might I aid you in getting these decaying bodies out of your lair?  Let me just drag this one out to a more convienient place...  *LOADING... PLEASE WAIT*<P>I mean, are we assuming here that the Dragons and Giants are planning on eating the bodies?  And, if they plan on eating humans, elves, dwarves (etc) then why would they be nice to *any* of us? Aren't we just food then?  <P>Or is it that they *like* the smell of decaying bodies?  <P>* * *<P>NOTE: I am not for or against the new change.  I can see how making this change will present a little bit of challenge in the area.  <P>However, on a reality-level it is about as realististic as a monk pulling a creature using feign death.  As if MoB X is thinking "Hey, theres a human.. kill him!  Oh wait, he's dead.. mmm.. no, he moves! Kill him!  Oh wait, he's dead again.. odd.. wait, he moved again!   Kill him!  Dead again?  Oh yeah, it has to be real this time..."<P>My opinion:  Allow players with good faction to drag corpses as normal and, instead, "nerf" feign death...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I dont have a problem with this change. Its not gonan affect everquest, or RoK, only SoV.<P>However i think they should have put a little more though into it. The way it is now is dragging any corpse is an agro. It should work off the deads faction, so only dragging the corpses of their enemies would agro. <P>Corpses dont have faction, fine...then faction could be added to a /consent, when you consent somsone it sets the faction on the consent. And when you drag it checks that faction to decide weater or not Mr.Dragon gets pissed off for dragging away the pc he just killed or ignores you dragging away one of his pc buddies that fell off a cliff.<P>Lets say you and a cleric friend are in the giant city, and you are both loved by giants. Then a_super_kos_not_on_gant_faction_npc00 comes along and kills you in the middle of the giant city. You pop at your bind point in permafrost....now tahts one hell of a long run to drag your corpse a few feet so your cleric friend can res it. This is a situation where your nonkos cleric friend should be able move your nonkos corpse 20 feet for a safe res, but cant because he will be killed by the giants that love both of you.<P>That kinda thing wont happen that often, but it WILL happen.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

"<P>so if someone dies from falling, and you pull their corpse, you get agroed on and killed?  that's so stupid, your whole claim about this is that an npc sees you dragging the corpse of their enemy, so that's why they will agro, HOWEVER in this instance if the person fell to their death and was amiable to begin with, then the monsters have no need to agro you because you aren't helping their enemy....where's the logic now??  you say a corpse has no faction, then the AI has no way of knowing if you are dragging an enemy or friendly corpse, so you solve the problem by having them agro anyone pulling someone else's corpse????  that's bull**** plain and simple.  Also, if this is such a great idea straight from the brains of Verant, then why wasn't it implemented throughout the entire game instead of just in Velious?  are the mobs in velious more jealous or something?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"Another stab at the heart of r/p by Verant."<P>Roleplaying is relative to each individual.  Don't ever assume something is not roleplaying just because it doesn't fit within your view of roleplaying. <P>"Aren't we suppose to rely on friends?"<P>Yes you are.  That's why you need a friend network of NECROS to summon your corpse or a friend network of powerful players who'll help you reclaim your corpse by FIGHTING your way to it, instead of cheesing the game by having some level 1 twink who is camped right next to the dragon city dragging your corpse out.  And oh yes, I know exactly what people do when they die in an unfriendly city and have no invis(or city inhabitants see invis).<P>"This game just keeps getting harder."<P>I think that's the point of Velious.<P>"Why would some monster know you are dragging the corpse back to the player?"<P>They don't.  Nor are monsters "suppose" to know your faction.  Hey I mean, do they give you an insignia of the dragon or insignia of the giant or something to wear to identify you as one of them? No, they don't.  This is a game, realism and gameplay must be balanced.<P>Overall, I think you people are complaining about a load of nothing.  Nobody complains when they die in Sebilis or Howling Stones and can't retrieve their corpses because nobody has good factions with Howling Stones and Sebilis.  Why *should* Verant make it so you can cheese the dragon city(which by all means is probably also a high level zone)?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have one problem Absor, that is if the zone is poorly designed.<P>Take for instance if the SoV zone is similar to East Freeport.  My Erudite walks through the gate, the guards tollerate him.  He is able to talk to some vendors, alot of them dont want to deal with him, thats fine with me.<P>Now there is a bard located very very close to the evil guild trainers located in the slum area.  You can agro him through the walls of the building, ie not even see him.<P>I dont mind not being accepted in places, I accept the risk for entering a city in which the guards at the front do not like me.<P>Another example is Neriak, I am loved in Neriak everywhere... except with the ghouls guarding the entrance to the Necromancer guild yet I am loved inside the Necromancer guild, I am a Necromancer.<P>Its just illogical placement of mobs and their associated factions which irks me and which makes me think that having further corpse recovery repercussions in zones will just add even more frustration to players.<P>Okay, let me give you an example and answer this please:<P>Assume Neriak is a SoV city.  I walk in agro the ghouls, i dont want to kill them as it may lower faction so i run for the zone.  I pass a number of guards which all proceed to harm touch me (yes, thats how i died).<P>Now I am not kos to the guards and didnt take a faction hit dying.  Question is A) Will the SoV equivalent ghouls wander back to their spot and B) will the guards now auto-attack me when I attempt to drag my corpse?<P>This is the key to the dilema, is the hate list still removed on death or not?  How are the mechanics going to be set up that will allow mobs to determine who is helping out?  Will the SoV zones be as poorly designed as zones like Neriak, Freeport, etc which invite you into their cities only to have illogical deathtraps located there?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

A further question:  does sneak extend to the corpse? (i.e. if I'm behind the mob - yeah, I'm a bard - and sneaking, will that cause aggro?)<P>Thanks in advance, in case this does get answered.

We ALL know it's about money--why not just SAY so and get it over with???<P>No one has ever said: Verant, you are EVIL for wanting to make more money! We are saying: yes, make more and more money, but STOP doing it over the virtual corpses of your current players!<P>thanks<BR>Alc</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Someone made a comment about the "network of friends" we are supposed to have that I thought was a very good point.<P>Other then that I see some SERIOUS problems with this concept.  These are high level zones (I'm guessing mainly it will be the Dragon City, the Giant City, and the othe city [sorry forgot the race]), and most very likely a large number of these citizens are going to see through invis.  So I go in and get killed.  I can't have my friend go in to get my corpse so I go in to try and get my corpse, bam I'm dead.  The only way I see of being able to get the corpse is with a necro and summon corpse.  I do not think i can express how much this situation sucks.  Basically if I die in a kos place of creatures far above my level I have just permanantly lost all my equipment unless I find a necro with a casket in time to get my corpse back.   On the plus side necros are now required for groups!  SoV group must have: Necro (corpse retreival), Rogue or Bard (Traps), Cleric (Heal and Rez), Tank, Wizard/Druid (Ports / Evac), Enchanter (If your trap finder/disarmer is a Rogue).<P>I really think this idea for corpse retreival is bad.<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It isn't going to be any more difficult than it is to do CR in current dungeons. If you go to a dungeon now and die down in it, can you get your non-KOS friend to head down and get your corpse? NO! So why should you in Velious? Did you earn some right that I don't know about? I can't believe I'm sticking up for VI, but all the attacks on this system are unfounded. Apparently people just want two things. 1) Easy CR and 2) to skip parts of dungeons, because that is all they are stopping with this. You won't die more, you just won't have an easier time than you do now.<P>-Thain Champion of Kalaim<BR>of Solusek Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What happens when "Joe Grief player" purposly ruins his faction in a place his race is normally liked. Then he proceeds to die in that place.  <P>He /shouts "Please help me get my corpse, I died to XXX and cant get there".<P>Friendly_Player agrees to get the corpse thinking "his faction must be ok.. no liars play EQ". So he drags the corpse and gets pounded to death losing 1 bubble of xp.<P>Wont happen? hehe dont bet on it. There are many players that will go out of their way to screw someone.  I have watched players attack an npc then run (with SoW) and /yell for a buff/heal (when the npc isnt visable). Some poor sap heals them and dies to the NPC.<P>I understand that these are bannable offenses, but why give people the ability to be a grief player in the first place?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036680-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036680.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036680-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036680-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=036680&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=036680&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
