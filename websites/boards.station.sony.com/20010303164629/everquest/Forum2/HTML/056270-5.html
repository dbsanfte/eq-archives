</FONT><HR>OK, now I know Verant hates the idea of stepping on other classes toes...so why did they decide to give all mage abilities to other classes? (Pets - Enchanter, Shaman, hell even Clerics get pets *** is up with that? DD - Wizards are ebtter then us it goes without saying but why do Druids get better then us when we get into the late 50s? Summons - Clerics and Shammies can both make food/water and i know that other classes can summon other misc items throughout the game.) Now I realy don't see any problems with giving the mages some of the things other classes have at later lvls...maybe a Jboots like speed increase at 44 and a Breeze lvl mana regen spell at 49 or something comparable. As for the whole drop spell thing I think we should have the option of questing to find/spawn a vendor that sells the pre 50 drop spells and the post 50 spells for a couple hundred pp a pop. After all i'd rather spend 300pp for my pet spells then to spend 5-20 hours camping for them or thousands upon thousands of pp buying them from other players. Another idea that intrigued me was the cross zone CotH. Make it lvl 58-60 and move CotH down to about 50-52. Not only would this give mages alot more popularity late in game but also make them far more group friendly for raids alot earlier. The only other thing that i realy want to bump is the fun spells. Giving mages stuff like summoned fireworks or realy weak armor/weapons with realy ornate looks would be realy cool for jsut farting around town. (examples - Summon Showy(Prop/Ornate/Gilded) Breastplate AC 1 with a cool red color, some gold trim and the plate look. All/All (no drop if ya want) just fer looks. Also Summon - Ornate Staff - 1HB 1 DMG 40 DLY that looks like the Staff of the Gathering)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hear hear Shar! The items you get on the mage epic by turning in the staves should be focus items. And the mage epic should be a focus for all pet types, so you don't have to get another earth and water staff for those pet types, taking them from mages who need for the epic - or go without the staves for those pets.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm a pre-50 mage and there is something that I would like to point out.  Many of the post-50 mages have posted that the class is fine pre-50.  Please take into account that when there were younger they had the benefit of sword of runes proccing for thier pet several times a fight.  I have noticed that since the *fix* to SoR my ability to solo has gone down to the point that there is no point to soloing.<BR>Now grouping is really the only option.  I like to group, so this would be ok if groups wanted mages.  I hear shouts for healers, tanks, and chanters all the time.  Shouts for nukers or mages?  Almost never.<BR>Give mages (even pre 50) a bump in groups so that a group might actually seek a mage in some situations.  The spell storage crystal has some potential here.  So does group buffs affecting pets.  Also weapon summons with different procs: cold dd, fire dd, stun, haste, renew summoning, whatever.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You've been asking for new summons and a lot have been suggested, but in most cases they are things that will never see the light of day.<P>One of the suggestions that comes up quite often are gate stones.  Now if we were just able to summon one up with no component that would be overpowered.  So why not add in a high level component, say a black sapphire or diamond, something along those lines or add in a new stone that costs about 200 plat.<P>Make the stones no rent like all our other summoned items.  The cost of a diamond is close to that of a gate potion bought from a vendor, and since this is a no rent item people won't start to hoard them.<P>Considering that wizards get translocate in the upper 50s I don't see how giving a gate stone to mages as our level 56 summon would be overpowering.  There wouldn't be too many uses for these but it would be nice if we could help the tanks stuck in Hate out.<P>This doesn't actually address the issues that 53+ mages are currently facing, but would be a nice added summon that wouldn't be overpowered.<P>Yaldaren<BR>Ninja Gnome<BR>Master of Wasting Money, wee, Tinkering</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I hope you have not given up reading this thread.  If you only listen to one thing I ever say, or only consider one of my ideas I hope it is this one.<P>As a mage I hate dieing to green mobs with a full mana bar.  This happens more than I want or should.  Mages have no escape spell.  However I offer a solution that I hope you consider.  <P>I do not think it would be unbalancing for us to reduce the casting time on the earth pet (the one one that casts root) to 2-3 seconds.  <P>By doing so a mage would have a fighting chance when they are jumped by greenies, undead, etc.  If you are worried about exploits, just make it have a long recast time.  <P>For some reason I cannot fathom our conjurations take an inordinate amount of time to cast and recycle.  I understand the logic of limiting the damage of our dd's and the like, but not for every day summons, including pets. <P>I think this would solve the problem nicely.  You must remember mages cannot travel with their pets safely.  It is very unwise to do so.  A short casting pet summon would allow a mage to at least defend him/herself if they are jumped by a mob.<P>I believe all of the other classes have a means to defend themselves if this happens.  Some better than others.  Everyone except mages...<P>Please consider this option, the casting delays on our spells make defense when jumped impossible.<P>I should have to rely on obtaining j-boots just to make my mage a playable character in the mid to upper levels.  <P>It is funny Enchanters, Wizards, and Necros want J-boots so that they can kite and solo more efficiently, Mages want them so that they can survive the run to the next dungeon and have a chance to escape if they get jumped...what does that tell you?<P>Respectfully,<P>Everwind Gale<BR>Mage Mith Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A short duration immunity to fear would definately give magicians a role against area fear casting epic encounters. The pet will still die fast to the area damage spells but thats to be expectable and I wouldn't mind burning mana to continually summon pets.. wizards do to newk.<P>I definately agree about the regrowth robe. Every other class gets a 55+ spells, magicians get spells like 49th damage shield and the absolutely useless swords of runes (perhaps this item was in the game before the swords were fixed and pets auto duelwielded?)<P>Nothing was mentioned about the offensive hit magicians suffer after level 50. All classes get the same hit, pets and newks don't improve on the same curve as they do to 50, but as the only pure offensive class, magicians get it worst of all. Our newks need serious looking into. Wizards also didn't improve much in maximum damage for one cast, but they did increase dramatically in casting time and resists. Perhaps that is the way to address magician spells, make them cast slightly faster? Take a look at the 57th magic direct damage compared to the 44th spell, is this really a reasonable upgrade after 10 hell levels? Char is actually faster damage overtime than Shock of Steel.<BR>Summary: Make Shock of Steel cast faster<P>No drop summoned items. What is with the Velious summoned item which is no drop? Its a stat modifying item that only the magician themself can use. Adds nothing to a magician for groupability and that is what summons are meant to do.<P>There really isn't too many places where pet pathing is so bad as to make them useless. There are places, don't get me wrong, but not too many. The biggest problem I see as a 58th magician is that pets switch targets when they arn't tanking and attacked by an additional monster. Which is basically every single fight. This gets enchanters dead and clerics out of mana and is probably the biggest class balancing issue for me. Its really not much to expect that if I tell my pet to attack something, that it should stick to it until that monster is dead. How adding just 1 command to ALL pet classes which only restricts pets to have one target maximum.<P>The magician epic needs to be addressed and it is class balancing issue. Seriously doubt there are even a dozen magician epics throughout all servers. How many cleric/rogue/shaman/enchanter ect epics are there ?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One thing I have never been able to understand is why magicians don't get any root what so ever. There is actually only 2 mana based classes without root and the other is a Shadow Knight who can feign and tank.<P>Try zoning into a dungeon at level 60 and getting a pet up while a level 10 monster is hitting you or a 6 second newk. <P>Magicians are totally 100% defenseless for around 5minutes after being resurrected, due to needing to med, loot malachite and summon pet. Is that balanced?<P>When pet dies, unless you are always vigilant and watch your pets health, and chainsummon, a magician is than 100% defenseless.

</FONT><HR>Absor, I have tried my best to read the whole thread, and I didn't find these mentioned, so maybe it's worth your reading?<P>1. -- Pets included in group spells --<BR>With the downgrade of pets to PC abilties, it would follow that they should be included in group spells. You wouldn't have to worry about raising the mana coast of group spells either, because it would balance itself out, as it's a win-win situation. The most common group spells, at least in high levels, are Group Resist Magic and Heroic Bond. If pets got Heroic Bond too, it would prevent some pet classes from begging for Heroism for the pets (yes some do), and save mana from the cleric to do so. Also, and I will discuss this further, it would be greatly beneficial if pets could have Group Resist Magic cast on them without having to beg for single target Resist Magic all the time. I'm sure the chanter would love it if I would stop asking him for MR on my pet.<P>Of course, this change would affect any and all pets, even those cute little bears. Who knows, maybe they could survive a riposte if they had Heroic Bond?<P>2. -- Pet MAGIC RESISTANCE is very low --<BR>Pets get slowed left and right, and Grav Flux lands on them almost every time. Grav Flux does no harm to pets, but it carries more than enough agro to cause a pet to ALWAYS switch targets to whatever cast it. Perhaps you should rename the spell to "Herd Pets" because the players almost always resist it, the pets almost never resist it, and the end result is the pets all flock to whatever cast Grav Flux. You should look into raising the magic resistance of pets to a level where spells do not automatically land on them.<P>3 -- Group damage shields mana ratio --<BR>Clarity, 75 mana<BR>Boon of Clear Mind, 175 mana<BR>2.33 times the mana cost, most group members benefit from clarity, so the group version saves both mana and time<P>Resist Magic, 85 mana<BR>Group Resist Magic, 200 mana<BR>2.35 times, every group member benefits from +55 MR, so saves mana and time<P>Heroism, 140 mana<BR>Heroic Bond, 420 mana<BR>3.0 times, every group member benefits from 400hp and 20ac, so saves mana and time<P>Shield of Lava, 120 mana<BR>Boon of Immolation, 360 mana<BR>3.0 times, only one perhaps two group members benefit from 25pt DS and +25 FR for 6 minutes, so saves time but WASTES mana<P>What is the idea behind group damage shields anyway? A damage shield is designed for one person only, that being the main tank. The short duration of these spells means that the recipients better get hit often while it's active, or else it's not efficient. A group version of this type of spell ensures that mana is being wasted, as usually only one person is ever being hit.<P>Lowering the mana cost to 240 (2x the cost of single target) would be a start. But I still don't see the point behind the group version of these spells. They can't really be used for their +FR attribute either, because they last 6 minutes only!<P>4. -- New spell: Elemental Barrier --<BR>Group version of our Elemental Armor series, entire group gets +50 FR and +50 CR. Very useful for raids (note to self: I might cast more than just COH on raids if I had this). Though not strictly useful in everyday groups, it would be great for raids. It fits in perfectly with the class.<P>5. -- New pet command: /pet buffs --<BR>Wouldn't it be nice to know what buffs your pet has? It's easy enough keeping track of Burnout and Damage Shields, but when other people buff your pet and keep asking when stuff has worn off, it would be nice to answer "pet needs xx spell" instead of "umm, I dunno"<P>/pet buffs<BR>My current buffs, Master:<BR>Burnout III<BR>Shield of Lava<BR>Symbol of Naltron<BR>Swift Like the Wind<BR>Chloroplast<P>I don't think any of this is outrageous, it is as you say "minor", but affects the class as a whole.<P>Faulk<BR>55 Conjurer<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Two simple questions<P>Why Pet SOW at level 58?  Why not at level 39? or sooner when we actually xp outside.  What use does a 58-60 mage have with pet sow at that level.  It would be much more handy for it to be 10-20 levels sooner.  Even if it can now be looked upon as the upgrade to the hopefully soon to be implemented pet jboot.  Getting a version at 29 and then 30 levels later doesn't quite cut it.  Screw the 29 pet jboot and give us pet sow at that level.<P>Why is it one of the (if not THE) rarest spell?  Please look into it's drop rate and where it's dropping.  It should drop off more than one place in all of EQ and it should be more frequent than EXTREMELY RARE.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sorry some of this may have been previously posted but dont have time to read the hundreds of mage posts to filter my own so here goes.<BR>First there is a perception as stated in this thread and by gordon on a number of occasions that the mage class is pretty balanced and the pets are fine. Gordan has said the pets are the most powerfull in the game. I would like mostly to have an open minded view of mages. Because if you go into this thinking ohh the mages are strong enough then nothing is going to happen.<BR>The mage pets are not the strongest in the game not even close. In a straight up fight with the necro pet yes they are about even. But look at playing style. A post 50 necro pet bakstabs and lifetaps procs. This means proc = no lost attacks like mage pets, and virtually unresistable spell unlike mage pets. Second necros FEAR kite remember, now they do it with a quad hitting backstabbing pet. The mage absolutly has nothing that as near as good as that. If you doubt me watch a post 50 necro some time they devestate things solo.<BR>The mage as stated in this thread is a great soloer appearently. A mage can solo yes but is not nearly as good as a necro or druid and arguably a wiz at the higher levels. A mage that choses to solo their whole life will die alooot.<BR>As stated many times, a mage has no crowd control or escape spells so a bad pull or wandering mob just kills us most the time, hell even a group or greens will quickly kill off a mage.<BR>What i would like to see:<BR>pets- they simply cant compete with the new mobs<BR>      post 50 they are our only defense so please<BR>      pump them up near the pre 50 ratios.<BR>escape- we need some type of escape type spell<BR>        the eye of zomm i a great idea 2 sec high <BR>        taunt high HPs maybe not even do any <BR>        damage but would pull the group of mobs <BR>        to it so the mage could run.<BR>DOTs- in their present form they are less <BR>      efficient than our DD. doesnt make sense.<BR>MANA- mages spend alot of time getting mana back<BR>      perhaps attach a small mana regen to the <BR>      phantom armor line. 1mana per tick on the<BR>      leather, 2 on chain, 3 on plate ect..<BR>ITEMS- very upsetting to see your high level<BR>       class specific stuff with reclaim energy<BR>       for the 20th time. Wiz getting rune4 or<BR>       small DD spells we get burnout or sum <BR>       bandages. You get my point. A small DD<BR>       for 200dd or so would be good to save some<BR>       mana thats the purpose i think.<BR>SUMMING- there seems to be many great ideas for<BR>         items to summon. specialty things to <BR>         limit their usefullnes are the way to go<BR>         weapons for pets with procs against<BR>         specific types of mobs ect..<BR>PATHING- i saw the proposed fix, this is a penalty<BR>         pathing is a game mechanics problem, to <BR>         have mages use a spell slot and spend <BR>         extra mana to keep their pet from getting<BR>         everyone killed is wrong. Make this a <BR>         skill for 34th level (recover pet). if <BR>         successfull your pet is at your side if <BR>         not start gating.<P>In short this is the last chance to clean up the mage class. Im personally excited to see what happens and a little worried. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just a couple of things ..<P>pet pathing:<P>why doesn't it just follow us on our exact path unless its  going around a wall.   at this point it should go up to the wall and take the closest path to the wall that would take it around to the mob.  whats so hard about that?<P>Mage dots:  i used this a couple of times cuz i thought it would be cool to have a dot.   here is the problem though.    the dot takes as long to cast as the same level DD if not longer.  AND it only does the same amout of damage AND its resisted a lot AND its ratio is pretty damn crappy.   i would rather nuke twice and med then cast these spells.<P>decoy:  fairly useless right now.  if this pet hit for the same as regular pets i would consider using it but as of now its very useless to me.<P>higher level pets should be different looking.<BR>earth: golem<BR>air: djinn<BR>water: goo<BR>air: drake<P>healing:  would be nice ...i never knew the use for these spells cuz i was too hight to use them when they came out and after casting it one time and seeing my pets heal go up a pinch and then go back down the next hit i never casted it again.<P>Fire pet:   i have summoned this three times.   two were in duels to help against a caster.   will never summon it for anything else.<P>Malosi: great spell if it would ever stick on a mob.    if i can get this to stick on a mob then you don't really need to cast this spell  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> cuz everything you cast will stick anyway.   yes this is after tishani.   yes i have this memed in hopes that it will stick and cuz ppl know what it does but the resists on it are even worse then the rain spells    much worse.<P>Rain spells:  if i have a single mob rooted and the pet is nowhere near and i have this memed, i will cast this spell if i could get malosi to stick..   needless to say i have cast this about 5 times in the past year and its usually never even memed.<P>impoved invis:  well sure thanks if you give it to us,  we would much rather have a decent escape spell like a 2 second gate called puff of smoke or something that a real mage would use.<P>Interzone cothing:    would be nice .... we get coth but would be really nice if we could pull across zones if need be.<P>Plane of Sky:   why the heck doesn't Coth work here?   we know how to do basicly the same thing even though it takes a death and a coffin  why the heck can't we coth here?    why give a spell then make it unusable in situtuations where it SHOULD be used?<P>summoned bags:   i haven't used these since level 10 when i lost my gems after a link death ...never again..   thanks for making a tenslot for the gift of xev too bad it doesn't ever get used just dropped on the ground.  Might as well remove it from the summon so we don't have to waste our time.   only thing i really use is the food and water anyway.  want to make it better make it a single item that feeds and quenches your thirst without having to take another slot.<P>i have a question ...what is blizzard? and why did you mention this? is this a cold spell we can use? never heard of it.<P>Muzzle of mardu:   i have seen one drop .....been in kurnark the entire time ...seen one and i don't have it <P>velocity: i don't know anyone that has even seen or heard of someone that has seen this drop.    <P>immune to fear for the pet:   wow i might be able to do something at a high level fight?   sounds good.  would be helpful as i usually don't rank a spot in a group with a cleric cuz we have no use at a dragon or uber mob raid other then the Damage shield and cothing others in.<P>Epic pet:   THAT was your idea of a good pet?   hits a bit harder and he looks like a big air pet?   at least freaking make him look different ...give him legs or wings or something.  make it a djinn in all zones ...sheesh  how lame   "look at my big air pet  yeah its my epic."<P>all i can think of right now ... <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The four things I would like to see changed are:<P>1) - Our level 59 BOLT spell is worse than druid's best dd. Plus, add in the fact that ours is Line-Of-Sight, and druids are basically better nukers than mages... Solution: Either make it somewhere around 1075dmg, or lower the cast time or mana cost.<P><BR>2) - Pet Hp bars!! This is an awesome idea that would really be a great addition to the group, even if only the owner can see the bar it would be still great.<P><BR>3) - Epic quest. Either lower the difficulty of it, or raise the difficulty of other classes epic quest (Rogue, Cleric come to mind). The actual epic rquest reward is great though, and doesn't need to be "enhanced" (or nerfed  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> )<P>4) - lvl50+ fire pets totally suck!

</FONT><HR>Yup, it's me again, back with another question/issue. This is more pvp oriented, though I know you're not truely looking at pvp issues at the moment, I believe this also could have an effect in the blue servers. It seems as though more and more you are altering the mage's pets to react to spells/mobs and effects like pcs. This is more of an issue on pvp servers then anything else but, if you are trying to make them work more and more like pcs, have them have the same effects/immunities as pcs as well. The best example I can think of is that the mem-blur/fear/charm lines of spells were deliberately altered to be non-effective against pcs due to their unbalancing nature in pvp. Well, they are just as unbalancing to affect pets in pvp. It has been stated that a pet should make up 50% of a mage's power/function. Well, when a single enchanter/necro spell can remove 50% of a mage's power for less then a bub of mana, this is unbalanced. In addition, the bard mem-blur song seems to be bugged in relation to pets. Rather then just wiping it's agro list, and sending it back to us, it is making the pet 'forget' it's owner, and self-destruct. Which means, for a manaless, one pulse of a song, a bard can remove 50% of a mage's power, as well as eliminate the bub of mana it took the mage to summon the pet. Obviously, in pvp situations, that means that a mage has functionally no chance against a bard, especially since we have no way of keeping a bard immobile once our pet is dead, so that we can never land anything near a finishing blow. As a whole, this issue does not really effect the blue servers, as for the most part pets and players don't really intereact beyond buffing and the like, but it is a major concern for the mages of pvp.<P>Laranos Lostpuddle, Level 55 gnomish Magi of Tallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Please considder how well ballanced Mages really are again ..<P>Its been stated before by others .. Mages are NOT very ballanced past lvl 50.<P>Playing a 55 Mage I know like any other Mage that when you use one of our so called "group friendly" spells .. Malosi..<BR>Please try look at these spells. Most MoB's over lvl 53 will just plain resist this spell 90%<BR>of the time .. there is little Idea for a Mage to use 40-50% mana to Malosi a thing that will be 2/3 dead from the tanks in group when you finally gets Malosi to stick.<BR>The only thing Malosi really helps, is it helps the chanter Mezz things that is very very hard to mezz. That leads us to .. Can I use a pet if I am gonna play bunny with the 3 things that the chanter needs to mezz for the group to survieve ..<BR>IMO Malosi is worthless. only spell in that line that is usable is Mala, wich is unresistable.<P>This leads to our post 50 DD's. Wether a thing is Malosi'ed or not both Char and Scars of Siggil gets resisted very very much on lvl 50+ MoBs.<BR>The same goes for Shock of Swords wich was good before Kunark came out.<BR>Please considder the statements about the Mage's roles in a group post lvl 50. Often We play plain Nukers, cause pet can't be used cause of bad pathing and encounters with Multiple lvl 55 things that cant be mezzed and have to be root parked. These things summons if they take dmg of any kind .. either by a pet or by a dmg shield, so again .. here our other "group friendly" spell .. Boon of Imolation is also worthless.<BR>Mages are a bad Nuker on these encounters, so a Wizard is far more suited for this..<P>This makes us be there for only ONE reason ...

</FONT><HR>Hola Absor. I been with this game a long time. do not wish to read what others posted so I may repeat some things. lemme say first, I do love the class, just some fine tuning is needed soon.<P><BR>1)fire pets-52 and 58 ones are all but useless. too low HP combined with casting of very low end wizard spells make them unwanted. HP I think is appropriate. <P>Solution- make them cast more than melee, upgrade DMG shield (okeils radiation? good god man what were they thinking?) and maybe a better dmg absorbtion spell ya think? <P>2)epic, I know it's prolly been said. but it's sadly overweighted and requires 0 skill. and total LUCK...make more skill.<P>solution-Need to either increase stave (inny) drop rate. or move to another mob (somethin maybe like the pally Tormented whateva, maybe somethin that pops after a rev is killed since they are harder to get to), also make it have something to do with our abilities to get it for the love of god...<P>3) mana regen, I know it's been said "chantrs can give us mana regen" i find this a sad statement. they can also give to wizards along with the mana regen they get. <P>solution-hmmm a tap spell. convert PET hit points to mana. like necro lich kinda. would be rather appropriate for the class IMO. even if it severly damages pet, say 200 HP of pet for 50 mana (4 for 1 ratio), would be at least SOMETHING<P>4)pathing- zones that are horrid for pathing...all of the hole, most of PoH, sebilis esp disco and down with all the fungi, most of Karnors, and almost every higher end dungeon I know.<P>5)mage apparel-maybe a robe that gave us a lil flashyness? just a fun idea. stats not a must, just want some looks man!<P>6)spell drops, I know of alot of spells that are almost impossible to get. they droppin, but not worth a damn really. Mala is COMMON compared to Muzzle of Mardu. Usefulness is equal. could list more instances but if ya more...you have my chars =P just drop a tell lol<P>7)mage DoT's- look...not sayin remove it...but at least make a use for it. It can't be used for a DoT, not mana efficient enoough over the DD ya get at that lvl, casts to slow to use the knockback capabilities on it. it and the DD are both 600 mana total nonresisted. The DoT takes longer to cast. look at the spell and other DoT's. I'm sorry but it don even compare up to a CHANTR DoT.<P>Solution- Lower cast time for Knockback use. OR increase DoT dmg (not initial strike dmg) OR lower mana cost. (fav tho would be either of the first two. or a combo)<P>there may be more things, in fact I know there are, that need repaired but am too tired to think of them. Good night, and good luck.<P>Senedor Fyreyes<BR>57 Tankmage<BR>"What do ya mean I'm not a tank!?!?!"<BR>Loading...Please wait....<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Mage's are the only casting class that do not get root as a spell. and dont give me the bull about "they have their pets.." When a mage's pet is dead, so is the mage. necro's have FD and shadowstep.

</FONT><HR>Greetings,<BR>   I have over 140 days logged on my Magician for the Veeshan Server. The only balance issue I think needs to be looked into for level 1 through 50 is the lack of an intermediate nuke spell from level 24 to 34.<BR>51+ is another story. Drop Bristlebane뇹 Bundle and the DoTs, give me a working Fire pet, give me better nukes, and if youre keeping the DoTs please make them more mana efficient then my Lava Bolt so I might even think of using them some day. Rain Spells, worthless; resist more then regular nukes I get full resists on green mobs even after I cast Malosi on them. And then there is the big Spell Drop issue. And because I don뇺 believe in presenting problems without a viable solution here goes:<P>Ideas for Balance level 1 - 50<BR>Problem  -  I found it very crippling to have to use my level 24 (Shock o Spikes) nuke for 10 levels until I got 2 nukes at level 34.<BR>Solution  -  Move one of our level 34 nukes to level 29, like blaze.<P>Ideas for Balance level 51  60<BR>Problem  -  Level 52 Fire Pet is weak and worthless, I can melee it and win<BR>Solution  -  Don뇺 remove the melee ability of the fire Pet from level 49. Add it back in and let the pet keep the spells, it뇹 bad enough there is no 51+ Fire Focus item, you know what I mean?<P>Problem  -  New Velious DoTs aren뇺 worth using because the whole point of DoT is mana efficient. My Lava Bolt is more mana efficient and instant damage. I use it instead of DoTs for this reason. <BR>Solution  -  Greatly reduce the mana costs or damage output per cast and they will be greatly utilized by all Magicians until the end of time.<P>Problem  -  Rain Spells I don뇺 care that they damage my pet, I don뇺 think it뇹 that bad. The problem is the resists I get on even green con mobs after I use Malosi on them. Because of this the Rain AE spells should not be considered in a balancing issue until they are fixed.<BR>Solution  -  Fix them so that they run on the same resistance scales as the rest of the nukes. It is quite obvious they have some kind of other greater power controlling their ability to work.<P>Problem  -  51+ Nukes for magicians are laughable. Need a nuke in there better then Lava Bolt in there guys. The nuke, so called upgrades, after level 51+ seem to be more geared toward faster cast with less mana efficiency then Lava Bolt. Our pets are there to tank, forget the faster cast and give me better damage to mana ratios. <P>  Thanks for your time Fixing these issues would balance our class most assureably. The spell drop rate issues are pretty bad, but as long as they are dropping somewhere not that bad. Stuff like Pet Health meters on our screen are nice trinkets but would not really improve balance issues for Magicians.<P>Cerano Vulcanus<BR>Magician of the 53rd Circle of Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I created a mage long ago, because I THOUGHT I would be able to solo whenever I was unable to find a group.  Once my mage hit level 57 I stopped playing him.  <P>Absor you say we can solo our entire career....where?  Sure I can go to Skyfire kill a wurm and sit for 10 mins waiting for mana.  It's real fun to kill 6 wurms an hour while you watch the druids and necros solo almost non stop.  <P>Absor you say we are a welcome addition to any group....when?  Half the time all I hear is; "Kill the pet!  Kill the pet!"  Without a pet we are poor damage casters.  <P>A few months ago I was running through FV invis when I caught the attention of a green frog.  No pet up, the frog is running as fast as my JBoots and I cant get a DD off because this dumb thing is interupting me.  Yep, that is when I came to the conclusion that I should have been a necro.

</FONT><HR>Some more ideas (maybe a few repeats)<P>1) Call of the Elements - Effect Call of the Hero but for PET ONLY!  Helps when your pet runs off due to bad pathing.  Maybe a level 39, 44, or 49 spell.<P>2) Summon Corpse - I know that this dabbles in the lines of the Necro/ShadKnight, but we are the masters of summoning.. or at least we should be. We're not currently.<P>3) Some sort of escape spell.  There are times when you're in a dungeon and haven't summoned a pet yet due to bad pathing, then you get trained.  When this happens mages are completely screwed, because we have a complete lack of defense without a pet.  I like the idea of an escape spell that summons the group to the mages bind point.  May be a touch inconvenient for some, but it would make us more welcome in a group.<P>3a) Alternative: Summon Elemental Orb with 1 charge of Summon Earth/Fire/Air/Water.  If we get jumped, 1 right click effect later, we at least have a pet to defend ourselves with or buy us some time to gate.  <P>4) Alternative spells for pets.  Right now (pre 49) our Earth Pet Roots, Air Stuns, Water DD Ice Based, and Fire pet a Fire DD and Shield.  Allow a mage to toggle which spell our pet's cast.  IE: Let the earth pet have two spells: Root or Snare and let the caster choose (/pet spell 1 or something)  A water pet is a good damage dealer, but against something with high cold resist might be useless.  Give it a lightning dd with the option to toggle it as well.  <P>5) Pet buffs.  The pet should tell us when a buff is fading instead of AFTER it's worn off.  A simple "Master, my Skin Like Nature is fading" or something along those lines would be EXCELLENT.<P>6) Epic Quest. a) Pegasus Cloak - how about making this mage only so we actually have a shot at obtaining this or make it droppable.  As it is now, we can hardly get it because Quillmane is a rare spawn and the cloak is a rare drop and the cloak is also sought after by 30-35 players.  b) How about making the staff a common or fixed drop from Innoruuk?  We still have a huge fight to kill Innoruuk, but at least we know there's some light at the end of the tunnel because one mage will get the staff needed for epic quest.<P>7) Research.  Our research is definitely the hardest of any class.  Too much chain research.  The chain research wouldn't be so bad if the needed components dropped more often.<P>8) Pet Healing.  My level 20 pet heal spell isn't enough to even make a pet blink anymore it seems.  It can only get worse.  How about new pet heals at 34 and 54?<P>9) Other.  Some summoning spells that summon pet only weapons would be nice, preferably some that proc.  If not that, then give us some useful weapons/objects to summon.  The two most common things (and about the only things 99% of the time) I'm asked for are Modulating Rods and Coldstones.  You'd think we could summon other things that are useful.  Remove the pet taking exp.  Get rid of the dots and add something USEFUL.  <P>Parntanne Shadowrunner<BR>40th Level Magician<BR>Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I read 95% of the posts and not one said the same as the first topic below.<P>Pets miss to much.  Maybe through a mages life they can no longer summon a pet stronger than the ones they get now.  At least till the Epic pet.  So maybe they learn to help their pets out threw magic?  Maybe an AC/STR/AGI debuff spell that will weaken the mobs so that the pets will land more punches. Mobs are usually much higher level then the pet and it will help a lot.  The name Elemental Maelstrom seems to fit perfect for this  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.  It'll be very good for the class in a group too.  <P><BR>  The next parts have already been said.  <P>Why do the Focus Items have no effect on the post 50 pets?<BR>Was this intended?<P><BR>Lack of defensive spells. Magician pre 50 is very offensive and this justified the lack of defensive spells.  In fact, I don't think there is another solo class that can kill a said mob faster than a magician in a realistic situation pre 50.  Post 50 the class changes so much that it almost justifies a Root/snare/new defensive type spell for those levels?  What constitutes the lack of defensive spells post 50 now since our offense was marginally upgraded post 50.  Could you please look into this?<P>Research Is NASTY! Let me explain.  It costs a lot and takes a lot a lot of time.  I probably have several days/played just in research alone.  I can quest for my skill to increase which takes for ever or I can put LOTS of PP in practice points to raise the skill or I can pay someone else who has high enough skill to make the spells.  It takes 3 items to combine to make 90% of our researchable spells which means I have to gather more items than anyone else which takes a lot of time.  And if I fail I still have to go get those 3 items again which is MORE time.  Let me give you an example of how much it costs.  I spent 685 PP on my 29 Earth pet at level 29. You know any other caster that pays that much for a spell pre 50?  1500 PP for my 44 pets and 1000 PP for my 49 pets. And this is in PRACTICE points only.  Not counting the costs for the scrolls or the costs for the items if I have to pay for them.   <BR>I just made a set of 44 pets for a guild mate.  I failed 5 times on the air pet.  The rest I succeeded in.  During this time I raised my skill to 153.   And you know what else?  None of this is the kicker about research.  The kicker is, none of it is worth anything post 50.  <BR>Maybe increase the drops of the mage Research Items or let us increase our skill faster.  I would also like to see research be worth something post 50.<P><BR>Everyone else touched base already.<P><BR>Scoobs<P>Moark 54.5 DE Magician of Eci</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Greetings,<BR>  me again I forgot to complain about pathing just because I dont think it will ever be fixed. If they just fixed pet pathing I would say Magicians wouldn't mind anything else ever being fixed. If not pathing fix then make a command that will make pets not hit back even if being hit or even a command that will make them attack the target we specify even if more then one mob is one them. This would make us able to use pet in groups and there by nulifing the solo issue because I would rather group if pet worked without hitting mezzed mobs.<P>Cerano Vulcanus<BR>Magician of the 53rd Circle of Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I can only assume, based on the fact that many of the more intriguing suggestions in the summoning thread were not considered or included in the initial list that started this thread, that those concepts are too radical or imbalancing.  Thus I propose or offer my support of the following:<P>1) New or alternate forms of escape seem to be a hot topic, yet I don't think Verant's idea of Magicians was to ever be able to get away easily.  I propose that they allow a simpler solution.  Rather than letting them escape outright, let them save themselves without escaping.  How, you ask?  I propose that they be given a form of feign death that does not clear aggro.  Huh, you say?  Bastion of Air.  Quick cast time, costs about the same mana as a gate, and creates an impregnable barrier of air around the mage.  Once cast, the mage could not move or cast or the barrier would drop.  This would allow the mage to see about getting assistance from friends or group mates (thus promoting grouping and social interaction), but would only prolong the inevitable if he were not resourceful.  And it makes perfect sense for a master of the elements to be able to do such a thing.  This would be imbalancing if the player's pet were allowed to live, so have the Bastion spell kill the pat just like an invisibility spell would.  If the dev team decided that mobs had to still be allowed to cast on the mage, then make it so that they can cast all they want but as long as the mage doesn't move or cast, the shield stays and protects him from melee.  My personal preference would be for this to essentially work exactly like a feign but with no aggro clearance.<P>2) Pets would be considered far more group-friendly if two rather simple game engine modifications were put in place.  The first being the ability to target group member pets by hitting their corresponding funciton key twice, just like the mage can do for himself.  This would make a cleric's job much easier with regards to targetting.  The other modification would be a blue bar implemented as on overlay on a player's health that indicated his pet's health (similar to what was implemented for the xp bar).  Again, this would help everyone guage the group's resources at a glance (minus available mana) and would make the healer's job easier.<P>I consider neither of these ideas too radical, nor very difficult to implement from a coding perspective.  The only difficult part from a graphics development perspective might be putting a pale translucent shield around the mage when his Bastion of Air spell was up.  = )  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I was under the impression that the Magician class would be getting these upgrades. Here is a quote taken from Geoffry Z(The ArchMage).<P>============================================<BR>"MAGICIAN <P>Look for: <P>Pet spells with new abilities, including:<P>Pets with spellcasting abilities <BR>Pets with higher taunting abilities <BR>Pets with dirty fighting styles <BR>A pet with a different type of duration "<BR>============================================<BR>This is what he said about Necromancers<P>"New undead pets with new abilities "<P>In his post he does NOT and I repeat does NOT mention that Necromancers get pets with dirty fighting styles. I am in no way asking for Necromancers to be nerfed, all I am asking is for US Magicians to be given what we were told we would be getting.<P>He said that pets would be given "NEW" abilities.<P>Earth pet still cast root and has no new dirty fighting ability. <P>Air pet still cast stun, and has NO new dirty fighting ability.<P>Fire pet now cast a 2pt dmg shield, and shield skin on itself. Melee's for 29dmg casts 3 lvl 12-20 wizard spells.<P>Water pet still cast an ice spell like its pre 50 brothers nothing new there, it was now given a dirty fighting ability called backstab.<P>I can't find the post saying that Earth pet is a Warrior, Water pet is a Rogue, Fire pet is a Wizard, and Air pet is a monk, but I remember it was said by someone from Verant, if it wasn't then please let me know.<P>Now let me talk about the Necromancer pet. Geoffry Z did not mention casting abilities, dirty fighting styles and higher taunting abilities for Necromancer pets in his post.<P>From what I've seen Necromancers have a rogue pet that backstabs(dirty fighting ability), have a spectre pet with casting abilities, and have a monk pet that does a flying kick (dirty fighting ability).<P>Magicians are a pet class and it is very frustrating when we were told we'd be getting upgrades which Geoffry Z. went into more detail than he did when he mentioned Necromancer pets. <P>The Greater Vocerate Fire pet (lvl 58 Magician pet spell) cast the same spells as the Vocerate Fire (lvl 52 Magician spell). Please look into this<P>Here are some problems and suggestions on how to fix these pets.<P>Earth since it is based on a warrior should be allowed to score a critical hit, and take massive dmg and taunt the best.<P>Air since it is a monk should be given a flying kick and have a faster dly than Earth pet.<P>Water, as of right now the 54 Vocerate Water spell is very rare and drops off of lvl 55+ mobs. This pet should NOT be dropping off of lvl 55+ mob loot tables. The magician will be 60 by the time he/she gets this spell, and that is just wrong.<P>Fire since this pet is based on a wizard, it should be allowed to cast higher lvl wizard (lvl 24 - 34 ddmg spells) give it a mana pool or something.<P>I am not asking for more power, all I am asking for is what we were told we would be getting. I assumed all our pets would be getting an upgrade since the conjuring of elemental pets is what defines us as a magician.<P>For any other Magicians or other classes that are reading this and want to support my thread, please do so without bringing in class envy, wanting more power, and flaming please to my post, it won't help us Magicians out. This post is no way Grass is greener on the other side syndrome. I only used necros as an example since they are an awesome class. Sorry for any grammer and spelling errors my post may have.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Runemaker here,  Friend to all mages in Povar.<P>Note,, one muzzle droppped in poa 5th isle boss. fyi,, no i didn't win it.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>I've been a mage since day one.  Mar 17th 1999.  and proud of it..  Reading the book that came With the game..  mages and necros are the solo class.  ok,, I rp a nice guy, not an evil bone sucking necro.. so i go mage.  knowing full well necros will be a bit stronger than us, due to their difficulty being evil.  what I didn't expect was to see druids wiz monks etc out solo us at hl.<P>Our pets need to be MUCH stronger than thay are.  they are = to necro pets, which Dont tank a mob like our pets do.  Fear is tooo strong a spell.  but I don't want mages to fear.. i wana kill with my battle mage!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Focus items:  epic needs to focus all pets.<BR>soul gem from tower of frozen shadow needs to focus Monster summon series.  Up the level of pets MS II gives you.  it is a 50th spell. and I get green pets 95% of the time.  make them muzzable.<P>coth multi zone, like gm/guide has, would vastly increase mages worth.  reduce downtime. and give us Something to make some pp with.<BR>warrior from far away tells you " hey can you coth me to seb bbl?  i'll pay you 100 pp"<BR>right now mages have no way to make money like many other classes.<P>change all our DD' bolts etc to conj. add new non fire dd's.  we conj icebolt, waterbolt, air blast, earth orb, etc..  VERY limiting for mages.  often we have to use very low level spells to hunt in same zones as others.  because mobs resist fire.  you don't see manay mages in soulb do you?  no because our dd's are fire and mobs resist them.   change all dmg spells to conj, and let a gm fix or spec from evo to conj.  I really wanted to spec in conj due to RP reasons, but looking at the mana cost i'll be using most i had to go evo.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">  chang it.<P>give us CONTROL of pets.<BR>/pet attack  forces pet to ATTACK dat dam mob! and no other until it is dead.  half the time were not allowed pets is because we can't get them on the right mob!<P>if you don't change the 52 58 wiz pet, at least give us some new commands for him.  /pet evac  /pet gfay  /pet tox  /pet iceclad    hahahah.  but good idea.<P>I've seen many other good ideas posted that I agree with.. just noting the ones I didn't see.<P><BR>NOW remember 95% of the changes we stated here Wont up the power of the mage, but it will make us a better class / group / raid friendly.<P><BR>We should be = or second in soloability  not last behind druid/wiz    as stated in your book..<P><BR>new summons weapons,<BR>store pet in gem,<BR>new spells vendors or research or quest, dropped spells sucksss!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>where is velocity?  is it a 'new spell' your gana 'introduce' into the game?<BR>drop rate on spells is bad.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><BR>change burn III to burn IV on pog armor.<BR>change robe to 56 dmg sheild.<BR>a coth that brings a mage To a group memeber in zone.<BR>drop ALL summon items from non mage stuff.<BR>pog boots?  find a new spell for that one summon bandaids does not rock!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>drop casting time to 0 on pog stuff, like old rclick items.<BR>reduce recast time on rage of zoom.  I never use it just because of the refresh is slower than pull rate on mobs.  easier to have a pet up than a rage every other mob.<BR>include pets in group spells if you make pets = pc's<BR>change hl pets to golem/guardian type mob <BR>reduce / drop pet exp when solo'n.<P>hmm, time to run off to work ;(<P><BR>RuneMaker Maji<BR>Povar<BR>55th <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Rastus,<BR>""Lower or remove the XP penalty on Magicians. The 50% penalty is ridiculous as was the penalty on hybrids (which you graciously removed). ""<P>&gt;&gt;Mages have never had a 50% exp penalty. Mages had a 10% just like all the other int casters. And all class based exp penalties have been removed.<BR>Please do a little reserch before posting things on here for Absor too look into.&lt;&lt;<P>The writer above is refering to the 50% of experience pets take if they do more damage than the mage while soloing.  <P>Does a druid, shaman, necro, wizard take an experience hit for using their main line spells? <P>No.  And arguably their soloing methods are safer where they can reduce mob foot speed.<P>Do magicians take an experience hit for using their main line spell, a pet? <P>Yes. At 50+ its very easy for a pet to do more damage than the magician.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok a few things here I see we could use:<BR>Imporved Invisibilty: Why do we need it? Because we mages can not walk around anywhere without a pet and not live...and invis helps alot. And for a class that has to walk around dungeons in a random invis at higher levels, with no means to defend ourselves once we lose invis..we die fast with the hard hitting mobs or Kunark and Velious. And its odd mages get invis before wizards..and wizards get this spell.<P>Spells: Above any other spell we could use a root of some kind. We are the only caster class that does not recieve this spell. This would allow use to stay alive without a pet. If we get attacked by something and we do not have sow, or near the zone, without a pet we are dead.<P>The Stun spells would be nice, but I don't see that we really need it.<P>An elemental form spell would be nice too. Necros are the masters of undead and can change to look the part. Mages are the masters of summoned beings...so why can we not look the part? Maybe make it a random elemental form that can give us effects like the enchanters elemental forms. You could even make a drawback to it...make it cost a component to cast. <P>Summoned Only spells: I think we could use a few more summoned only spells. LIke Fear Summoned or Lull Summoned. Once again we are the masters of summoned beings....necros get these spells for undead..why shouldn't we get them for summoned.<P>Pet names: It would be very nice to be able to name your pets or even name them "yourname's pet"<P>Pet graphics: New pet graphics would be nice. I've thought that for post 50 spells new pets should have graphics. Earth pet could be a Golem from City Of Mist. The Fire pet could be an efreeti or imp of some kind. Not sure what air or water could be. They could all even be different color versions of the Golem's from City Of Mist. When people see a Necro with a spec pet they know it means power..<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056270-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056270.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056270-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056270-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056270-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056270-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056270&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056270&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
