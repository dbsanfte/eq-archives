</FONT><HR>There are multiple parts to this post but I think if you read it you will be excited about the idea and hopefully with your Support Verant might even start to implement something like this.  Please comment.<P>Let's start off with a review of the general type events that seem to cause so much unhappiness.  GM spawns ultra high level mob in a low-mid level zone, which then either of it's own will or the GMs comences to wipe out all the low-mid level chars.  Eventually word spreads and Uber Guilds/Chars show up and kill the Uber Mob, get some Uber or not-so-Uber loot.  Meanwhile the people who were in the zone are busy recovering their equipment off corpses, and if lucky gettin xp rezzes.<P>Good/Bad points of this type event. Good First:<BR>Introduces a random risk factor<BR>Allows players exposure to mobs they may not otherwise see for quite some time<BR>Breaks the Monotony of hack/slash/med/camp routine<P>Bad Points:<BR>Little to no creativity involved<BR>High level players take the Reward, low-mid take the brunt of the Risk<BR>Little to no story involved<BR>Lots of upset customers<P>How can this situation be fixed?   Suggestions to follow with an example to tie it all up:</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Implement a Town Crier in each City.  Perhaps have him sell newspapers.  The way things are now, if you don't spend a bit of time on these boards, OUT OF THE GAME, you'll probably rarely have a clue when a GM event is about to happen.  Newspaper IN-GAME could be used to post articles pertaining to the city the paper is sold in and/or norrath wide events.  The Town Crier could randomly shout headlines every minute or so to the ppl in the city as a teaser to get them to buy a paper and as information to the players.  <P>Solicit Quest/Event ideas from the players.  Perhaps this would be best handled outside the game on Harpy's Head or something similar.  Seen this on Many MUDs and works well.  Players submit a story for an event/quest by posting on a specific board.   Someone/team reads these ideas and as interesting/feasible ideas are found the ideas are made into actual events.  To avoid having people come up with puzzle/riddle quests and then giving spoiler info out to their friends/guilds only a general theme would be posted/used.  Specific mobs/items required to successfully complete the quest/event would have to be chosen by VI staff.<P>Now, how does it all go together you ask? Like this:</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Following article runs in the paper for a few days:<BR>Headline:  Goblin Unrest Grows Throughout Kunark!<P>Sneagy Whisperfoot reports after scouting the Frontier Mountains and several surrounding areas, that the Goblins from the Mines of Nurga, Temple Of Droga, Lake of Ill Omen and perhaps beyond seem to be collaborating to achieve some diabolical ends.  Messages intercepted after the slaying/capture of Several Goblin Scouts Indicate the Chief Rukgus, Lord Gorelik and several other hig ranking Goblins of the several Kunark Clans have grown tired of the constant raids upon their homelands and are planning some sort of unified action to exact their revenge.<P>After that another article posts the following:<BR>Headline: New Reports on Goblin Unrest reveal shocking plan!<P>A message from Chief Ruckgus to Lord Gorelik intercepted today indicates that the goblin clans are readying their best warlords and legions of warriors for an assault on Cabilis as revenge for the injustices they have suffered.  The message also referred to some outside help that would be standing by if needed to assist the Goblins.<P>Now this is how it all goes down:  The evening of the event is marked by abnormally large amounts of Goblins forming up at the entrances to the Goblin Caves in Lake of Ill Omen.  Just after dark on a rainy night(GM induced if possible) under cover of the diminished visibility a fairly large horde of Goblin Warriors, Warlords, and a few Whipcrackers along with various others head out from the Goblin Caves in Lake of Ill Omen.  Slowly at first, until sighted then all hell breaks loose as the hordes attempt to work their way to Cabilis Slowly... Slowly because they are meant to lose.  This is where the hint at outside help comes in, as the Warriors and Warlords are finally slaughtered, a few Bloodgills come to their aid from the lake, also a few of the Higher level Goblins pop into the fray to help turn the tide, as the tide inevitably begins to turn against the new horde, Lord Gorelik, Chief Rukgus, and a few other high level gobs come out of the Goblin caves surrounded by an elite guard of level 40ish guards and make a last stand.  Inevitably the Goblins are slain after several hours of battle.  Over the course of which, mid levels 20-35 or so have been taking out packs of Warriors through Whipcrackers and finding a few slightly nicer drops than normal, the higher levels 40s-50s are occupied with the Bloodgills and finally the named ones and as well find some better loot than normal, perhaps forced load of mithril staff along with the best loot to be gotten off the other named mobs.  GMs observing the events could hand out a couple uber items to those few observed by them to have been instrumental in repelling the attack.<P>End result hopefully:  Lots of people of varying levels participating in a major GM Event with MANY people gettin small rewards and a few getting somewhat heroic rewards.   Deaths inevitably happen, but through the town criers/newspaper articles over the preceding week, they can't really cry foul in that adequate warning was given/hinted at least.  An actual story unfolded and is now a permanent part of Norrathian History the outcome of which wa decided by the Players.  Perhaps following such an event a new book could be found on some of the merchants describing the events and naming some of the noteable Players involved.  <P>Guideline for smaller event in next post... </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Small Event/GM Quest<P>Article in paper<BR>Headline:  Mgubgub Guumbik Calls a Gathering<BR>Mgubgub Guumbik, local Ogre Shaman has called a gathering of Norrath's most adventurous souls to assist him in procuring the fabled Staff of Omnipotence.  Mgubgub requests any interested adventurers meet where the path joins the Feeroot and Innothule Swamp.<P>Guideline for quest can vary from Simple bring me the head of such and such mobs scattered throughout surrounding areas for lower level dynamic quest type event.  Said mobs would have to be preloaded with a specific item.   This type of quest could be used to encourage exploration of lesser known areas in Norrath.  Even the occasional invasion of Uber Mob into lesser zone would be made less frustrating if handled some way other than Big Dragon wanders into FoB and proceeds to immediately kill everyone in the zone until all the twinks log in their main and finally defeat it.   For Example, say Targrin, that big ape thing, or something similar is goin to invade  the rest of FoB... Well, real easy way to let people know is to have him shout something JUST before he hits the shore and starts spanking people, or perhaps just swim across with him and sit on the of the pit for a minute or two... just a little warning before you go spanking the hell outta all the newbies and lower level chars in the zone who will almost certainly GAIN absolutely NOTHING when he is finally killed.  If yer gonna do a mini invasion of an area with mobs of appropriate level for that zone, then by all means just run in and start attacking.  Groups at least have a chance if the mobs are similar level and tis very believable that from time to time those gnolls might just decide to group up on YOU instead of vice versa.  Just don't go dropping some Insane level 50 Gnoll pup into Innothule Swamp and call it a GM Event, that's just silly and does little other than tick people off...<P>I could go on for even longer, but this is WAY more than I had planned to start with, so I'll end here.<P>Please comment on this, <BR>Sciek  -  Shaman of the Tribunal<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Spawn a mob in a zone where nobody in that zone is capable of killing it and the players are going to have to get help from somewhere.  That'll take time and the word will spread and more and more people will descend on the zone making it even worse.

</FONT><HR>I see the point about not letting everyone have advance knowledge of events due to overcrowding of zones. I still think the paper/town crier would be nice and would be better than just sticking any quest type info on Harpy's Head which isn't even in the game *boggle*<P>Still, as many have said already, just sticking a high level mob in an area and killing lowbies like the plague is not an event.   The main thing I would like to see are events that actually HAVE A PLOT.   I really think the idea of using these events as stories in some of the books for sale around Norrath would help to make them much more popular.  Everyone wants to be famous/a hero.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Allright, here we go<P>From what I hear, GM events consist of a high level mob killing everyone.  I have deduced that 2 things cause this.<P>1.  The high level mob is SUPPOSE to kill everyone.  An Undead Host will not sit around and wait to be killed, or wait till someone attacks.  They just arn't like that.<P>2.  Players jump at the chance to attack any named NPC because of the chance of really good loot.  This is the philosophy we have developed as EQ players.  <P>The Solution:  Make sure that EVERY PLAYER KNOWS THAT THERE IS A GM EVENT IN THE AREA.  If they do not wish to participate, they can leave.  If they do, they can stay and actually role play.<P>The problem stems not from the GM's alone, though some of the blame goes with them.  But some of the blame also must lie with the players and the player philosiphy (I'd say about 1/2 of the players have this philosophy all the time) of kill anything you see if you can in the hopes of actually getting a good item.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>i would like to see more organised hordes with maybe one leader who doesn't wander... and in the level range of the zone. If your going to have orcs try and raid the newbies, make sure its like one orc tactician and a bunch of pawns and centurions... yeah newbies will dies, but they'll take some down with them... and thats how battles should happen, and some wood elf and high elf guardsshould come down after a bit and quell the hordes... and in non-town zones there should be at least 1 good npc fighting for the players... for some. eventually the enemy leader should be slain by the players or the good npc, or if the good npc is slain then the horde should rampage for a while, the enemy should despawn and they should leave... victorious<P>something along these lines would be fun.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I am not an expert but here are my suggestions for server wide events for certain Holidays like Halloween:<BR>1.)	Offer a program for people to volunteer not to be a “Guide” but to be an “Event Official”. This would allow people to help run an event without giving them special abilities. Offer them an item that is fun but doesn’t impact game play  (i.e. a Lore, No Drop helm that looks cool but has no stats). Use these high level characters to assist the GMs or Guides in running scavenger hunts, races, games of hide and seek and the like or give them the a part in a script and let them role-play to further the story along. I would be very interested in doing this myself.<BR>2.)	A very high level mob placed in a newbie zone really promotes high zone populations. Instead of putting things like a Dragon in the Lake of Ill Omen where anyone who has the Kunark expansion can reach. How about spawning some ultra rare MOBs in the higher zones so that the High level guilds can go there and play without having to worry about massive lag. These MOBs could be spawned during special event days only. <BR>3.)	Don’t be as aggressive in moving very high level spawns to mid level zones. (e.g. A Dragon in Frontier Mountain or and invasion of 10th lvl skeletons in West Freeport, maybe Emperor Crush running through Kelethin…) this would keep the mid level player occupied without causing their immediate death when some 55+ Dragon is dropped into the zone they are hunting in. If these spawns were timed properly it would have the effect of moving the population in waves into the next lower “Level” of zones without massive spikes of 200 players all trying to get into one zone. <BR>Imagine this scenario, Emperor Crush appears in the zone near the POD in Kelethin and begins attacking players a call for help goes out and people in zone run to help, a minute or two later Dark Elves from Lesser Faydark appear in Crushbone, then drop some giants spawn in Lake of Ill Omen and after a minute or two a dragon into FM.<BR>If something strange happened in every zone there would be no need for people to zone to another zone to see what was going on.<BR>4.)	Put a Jack-O-Lantern next to all of the PODs. Set them to sell candy or give a Lore item when you say “Trick or Treat”. You collect these from every Jack-O-Lantern on the server and turn them all in to the King Scarecrow to complete the quest.<P>If the number of events are increased and spread across the server in location, frequency and level there would be less clumping of players in zones. This would also reduce the amount of spectators (which causes lag) since there would be something else to do other than just watch a bunch of high level players try to slay a high level MOB so that they can get their corpse.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

It took approximately an hour and a half for me to be able to log on without LD'ing within seconds and get the heck out of there.  Was able to play an alt in a different zone so was not my problem.

</FONT><HR>I love the type of event Sciek mentioned.  How about this as an idea of how to implement it?<P>At the time the event is ready to start, the GM or Event Manager controlling it look at who is in the zone level-wise and set the number/strength of goblins appropriately.  Then the zone is locked so that nobody can zone in, but anyone can zone out if they wish.  People trying to zone in from adjacent zones are ported to a 'safe spot' within the zone they were leaving and any agro list they are on is cleared (in case they were trying to avoid a train).<P>The event starts and runs as you described, but no high levels are able to zone in to ruin the event, or crash the zone.  Players who do not wish to participate can zone out if they want.  Anyone who dies in the event loses no experience, even if it's a normal mob that kills them, and after they respawn, get summoned back into the zone so they can continue to participate (in case they are bound outside the zone)<P>Then, and this is the important point, *everyone* who participates in the event gets some small reward, even if they just died and /q out to keep from multiple deaths.  The GMs should have a list of everyone who was in the zone when the event started, and can keep track of who participates in the event fairly easily I would think.  Or, how about every goblin that is part of this event drops a NODROP/LORE ear, or claw or something.  That item can be turned into a GM-controlled NPC for a reward later.<P>Certain higher-value loot would be handed out at the GMs discretion based on people they saw taking extraordinary measures to roleplay the event or something.<P>On Cazic, most of the loot from Faydedar was ninja-looted by people who couldn't even use it, the loot from the Scarecrows went to people who weren't as big a part of the event as other players, etc.<P>Just an idea.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hmm, with the idea of "Ooo, a GM event, let's rush to that zone!" and zone crashing... if they were more commonplace, then perhaps people wouldn't run to them, but wait for them to happen where they are?  I particularly like the idea of "event official" that someone suggested, someone with power JUST for that event and then booted back to normal playerdom.  A lot of us don't have the time to play AND be a guide, so that would also satisfy that urge.<P>Jaredani<BR>Shaman of Justice<BR>Test<BR>----<BR>Diny<BR>Cleric of Underfoot<BR>Tholuxe Paells</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>No, as I see it, the zone crash argument isn't valid. It happens anyway. As soon as the event starts, word spreads and people flood in. As others have pointed out, if the events were more suited to the abilities of the player levels normally in the zone (Even if they have to team up), there would be less cause for the influx of players. As it stands, the main reason people flood in is people in the zone call to the high-levels in their guilds and high level friends to come clean up the mess so they can play.<P>Abashi, you said you can't run these types of events to please everybody. Yes, that's true. But the way you're running them now ticks off more people than it pleases, and this CAN be improved hugely. NO ONE likes being "drafted" into "being a victem". Especially when they don't get anything out of it. The characters aren't the only victems in this case, so are the players. The ABSOLUTE WORST is when the "event mob" SUMMONS PLAYERS TO IT from anywhere in the zone. Those who are attempting to avoid the chaos and get away while they can are sucked in anyway.<P>Yeah, some enjoy them. But even more don't. And those that don't have any fun whatsoever. They're left frustrated and feeling abused.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I personally like the goblin-raid style of event. Granted, I miss EVERY event, but hey... Come no, it doesn't take a lot of imagination to realize that being a level 20 in the zone with Faydedar is bad news. You're just not going to get anything out of the event except maybe some big teeth marks in your brass armor. I would personally rather see (well, if I EVER see one) a nice wave-attack style event, where people who stand no chance can get the hint slightly before a 30 level higher red critter snacks on their head.<BR>Dark elves are invading from Nektulos!<BR>The guards, killable by a mid-teens group, charge in first.<BR>The mid-teens group, after seeing the guards progress from blue to white/black to yellow to red, (and maybe hearing the DE commander shout about sending in the next wave) realize that they can't help anymore and leave, or stay out of the fray and try to help as best they can. The mid-teens group gets something out of it, and they maybe have a chance to escape with their lives.<BR>Next, a mid-20's-30's group engages the DE Dragoons who charge out to help their falling guard brethren. The Dragoons get stronger and stronger, until eventually, an elite guard group with the DE general and whatnot arrive. The mid-level group steps aside for the big guns, after having made some sort of difference in the event aside from an extra pile of corpses for somebody to look at.<BR>The 50+ players arrive, and having not been able to attack anything up to that point, engage the DE general, and whether they win or lose, the event ends.<BR>The result:<BR>1) all level ranges can participate, and actually make some sort of difference (assuming your level 15 gets there when the level 15 stuff is fighting, but hey, timing is a part of any GM event)<BR>2) when their usefulness is outlived, the intelligent lower-levels can maybe get a chance to escape with their lives, what with hearing the DE Commander scream "SEND IN THE DRAGOONS!"...they zone, decrease zone population, and live<BR>3) the event isn't monopolized by a high-level group or groups<BR>4) No one can really call the event a mindless GM killing-spree, because the attackers were actually ORGANIZED in their attack, and people could just possibly figure out what the heck was going on just by listening for a minute<P>Eh, well, I'd ramble on some more, but I don't have time, with another class coming up in ten minutes or so. I'm also still kind of annoyed that I missed a nice event in my level range last night...Oh well.<P>Okay, I will grant that say, half of Kith's werewolf population escaping into the commons should be slightly unorganized, but Verant, consider an organized attack every now and then, maybe?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Events really need 3 things.<P>1) A story<BR>2) A warning<BR>3) A chance<P>The most recent event I was in involved three high level (not sure which level, but red to my 25 and to a 35 that was present) druids who decided to protect the hermit.  They refused all conversation and slaughtered anyone coming close.  Some 50s arrived and everyone went into kill mode.  A level 14 druid ninja'd the corpses and ran away with some nice mid-level stuff.<P>There was a warning (they shouted to the zone), a slight story (the shout was all we got out of them), and no chance.<P>So, how could this have been better?  There were three druids.  The level range in South Karana is pretty big, but we'll say 15 to 35.  <P>Step One) Shout out that the Hermit is under protection and anyone wanting to fight him will have to deal with us first!<P>Step Two) Make druid one level 20 who can't be hurt by 20+.  Make druid 2 level 30 who can't be hurt by 29+.  Make druid 3 level 40 who can't be hurt by 39+.<P>Step Three) Give a story.  Perhaps only spawn one and two then when one is near death call in druid three.  When druid three is dead, spawn an enraged hermit at normal level but with lots of hp to be able to fight everyone.  Spawn them all with no loot, but have a GM invis watching.  Have a good druid spawn and reward the three most valuable with items and everyone else who fought with money.  Note that, reward EVERYONE.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Once, in a game called Gemstone3, there was a 3 month warning of impending invasion and doom.  How fun it was to to set up divisions of classes and skills into groups for the sole purpose of protecting the populace of the incoming invasion.  Each week, we would meet on a Tuesday, each division having its own territory to protect, each class working together, warriors on the front lines, archers hidden away behind the lines, etc etc.  When the invasion came, many people died, but after a 3 day battle (real time) the populace succeeded.  Was by far the best roleplaying event I have ever witnessed in my 5 year online gaming experience.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=027826&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=027826&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
