</FONT><HR>ATTENTION....ATTENTION....ATTENTION<BR>Ok, this is not the normal post where I repeat what the last hundreds of posts have explained (i.e. mainly defense and so on)<P>I have been playing EQ since a month after release and my highest level char is still only a lvl 32 Ranger, but what I have seen wrong with the class this entire time is that even though we are a mix of two classes we have NOTHING, I repeat NOTHING, to make us unique (except for RNG only Armor and Weapons but you know what I mean)<P>My Suggestions:<P>1.) Give us a Druid Defining Spells but at a very high level and nothing great but useful-<BR>a.) Ranger Teleports-To Qeynos Hills right outside Surefall Glade, Ruins in Kithicor somewhere near either Kithicor or Morin areas, and either to Lesser Faydark or Greater Faydark Rings (Personally Lesser makes more sense to me, more dangerous so less useful and also isnt a direct route to a city, none of them would be)<BR>b.) Ranger Charms-Give Rangers Befriend Animal at lvl 30 or 39, max level of pets are 15 I believe with this spell so it would not infringe on any of the pet classes but it would give us something nice and decently useful that fits our class and gives us a Parent Class Defining Spell, also a possibility is Charm Animal at level 56,57,58,59 or 60, this way the max animal is 25 I believe so it does not infringe upon the Druid Bear Pet Spell at all (believe they are 33-35 and do not poof after 8 minutes) but again allows us some use of the spell line beyond the Befriend Animal which can be known to dump your pet in about 3 seconds or less.<BR>c.) Ranger Treeform-Give Rangers Tree Form (Level 9 Druid Spell) at lvl 39, this would allow us a very minimul regen spell earlier on and give us a Parent Class Defining Spell, could also be upgrade later during the Outrider or Warder levels if so desired.<P>a. b. or c. will give us a Parent Class defining spell, something I believe we desperately need.<P>2.) Give Rangers a Class Defining Skill<P>My Suggestions-<P>a.) Arrow Blast- You always here of a one shot Ranger Skill and this I believe has alway been asked for as an insta-kill or some damage way to high. My suggestion is that we get it at lvl 15 or so and what it does is that we hit 100% Automatically and that it Hits for your level/bow/arrow combo's Critical Hit Max Damage +(2 times Your Level in Percent)<BR>So lets say you are a level 30 Ranger using a Trueshot Longbow and 1 damage arrows. The Maximum Critical Hit Damage at this level is 44 (or atleast it was when I was level 30) and so then you take 60% of this (Level 30 Character) which is 26.4, round to 26 and add...70 Point Shot. Make the skill recycle 45-72minutes depending.<P>b.) Tumble Back-Make this skill somewhat like a dodge or parry skill, that it is automatically triggered not manually. This skill would trigger when you are hit and should be stunned and would work based on your level in percent (so at lvl 49 it would work 49% of the time that you would be normally stunned) and have it move you back a good distance, about twice the range of melee, so that it also has the draw back of you losing the fighting time of those seconds but not nearly as much as being stunned and also you dont take the damage for the hit, maybe have this skill also lower aggro rate so that we arent turned into bloody green pulps at higher levels.<P>c.) Flurry of Sweeping Blows- Rangers are supposed to be the masters of dual wielding? So how about an ability gained at a level between 17 and 25 that allows us to make more attacks that round than normal? Perhaps 6 or 7 attacks that round that would be rolled against normally also give each attack a small chance of stunning a target (wouldnt 6 or 7 consecutive dizzying strikes stun you too?) maybe 5-15% chance on each hit. The skill could recycle at the same rate as LoH and HT.<P>3.) Ranger Allies-Always liked this idea but doubt it will go good with you, how about that at the creation of a Ranger he must choose between a number of animals, primary being Wolf, Cat, and Bear and from then on the ranger always has a pet with the fighting skills (max for that level), hit points (natural)and AC (natural)of 1/10 the Ranger. If the pet dies it is gone for 72 minutes and cannot be summoned in and Indoor Zone. The pet would be deleted when you zone but as soon as you come into the new zone a message asking to recall the pet would appear (like a resurrection message) and only if you zone into an Outdoor zone, if you zone into an indoor zone the next outdoor zone you enter will send you the message. If you died and the your in an Indoor Zone when the 72min. recycle time is up then you will recieve a message to recall the pet the next time you enter an Outdoor Zone.<BR>This in NO WAY, I repeat NO WAY would infringe upon summoning classes the maximum hitpoints the pet could recieve at lvl 60 is about 210-250 if that and would only have about 1-25 skill points in any skill at any time. Also if you consider the pet at a low level, say lvl 7, then the maximum hit points of the pet will be about 20-25 and it will only have about 4 points in skills to use, making it hit anything for a bout a max of 2 and dying in one to two hits, making it nothing more than a friend and companion. This would just add the Ranger with something class defining, fun and VERY original. <P>-Thank you, I have always wanted to share these ideas to someone that might get the to be put ingame, I doubt any of them will but please consider them like a serious post and request to Ranger Balance.

</FONT><HR>I'll start off by saying that I'm also guilty of not reading every post but I don't recall seeing anyone bring up something Abashi long ago said he wouldn't see a problem with. And that is a similar Assassination ability with bows like the rogues get with backstabs. I don't see an unbalancing issue with this, and it adds a little bit of spice to the class that is supposed to masters of archery. We all know a well placed bow shot is every bit of effective as a well placed backstab. *tosses his 2cp into the hat* Thanks for the oppurtunity to discuss final tuning Absor, I hope you write this down on your list.<P>Elidrin Blade`Storm<BR>59th Outrider of Soul Assassins<BR>Lanys T`Vyl</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>About Defense. Ok there are 7 melee classes in the game (warrior, rogue, monk, sk, paladin, ranger and bard).  Of these, 6 will now have defense of 250-252.  One will be left at 200, to wit the ranger.<P>My question is simple, why?<P>Why does a rogue/monk, for example, justify a defense of 252 while keeping the ranger at 200?<P>Now ranger will have at least FIFTY points less than ALL the other melee classes BEFORE even considering the ac discrepancy of plate vs chain.<P>Verant kill us some more please. You didn't increase our defense when ROK came out.  You made the AC difference between plate and chain even wider than before ROK.  Now you are increasing every other melee class to 250-252 defense EXCEPT the ranger.<P>People FORGET dodge/parry/riposte, it has virtually LITTLE statistical importance.  AC and hps is ALL that matters.<P>Why a song playing bard, for example, gets 250 defense while a warrior-type ranger stays at 200 is literaly beyond me to understand.<P>Why a group would still choose a ranger over a monk/warrior/rogue is beyond me.<P>There is NO justification for keeping the ranger at 200.  NONE.  And I defy anyway to so justify it.  Keep in mind that any rationale given would apply equally to rogue/monk, yet they have 252 defense.<P>As for plate vs chain, how come plate doesn't give NEGATIVE agility and dex stats?  How is it that someone wearing the greatest of HEAVY armor NOT receive a penalty for this.  Imagine ones agility and dexterity dropping 50-60 points (AS IT SHOULD).  At least force people to make a choice, go for higher ac at the expense of agility and dexterity. As it stands now there is only a BENEFIT to wearing heavy plate, and this benefit only widens the gap further for rangers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Over the past year, in one fashion or the other, I have participated in these ranger threads.  From the point that I was involving myself I saw many things said by various people that weren't necessarily supported by anything, including logic, yet they were taken as the word of Verant.  They were taken even though these people weren't representatives of Verant, and in some cases I saw Verant pick up the ball and declare, that since we had ordained it then it would be so.  One of these was the issue of whether the ranger was a tank or not.<P>I am a bit dismayed.  Repeatedly throughout this set of Ranger Talks have I seen this same falsity propogated.  I would like to say that I am speaking to not just Absor and Verant, but also to the various other players of rangers and otherwise.  The ranger class is a tank.  It has always been a tank.  It was a tank from level 1 to 50 and it remains a tank.  Every ranger, regardless of how they feel they are playing the ranger class is playing it like a tank.  Some taunt always, some taunt never, and some taunt under specific circumstances.  In any case, taunt isn't the deciding factor of whether a class is a tank.<P>Are there factors that can be examined to determine of a ranger is a tank?  Sure there are.  Are they viable factors that are accurate and allow us to draw a solid indisputable conclusion?  Yes and no.  Yes there are but there will always be someone that seeks to pull gnat **** out of pepper to declare that this or that factor indicates that the ranger class isn't a tank.<P>Rangers are primarily a chain wearing class.  This means that they have a limit on the type of armor they can wear.  What this does not mean is that the ranger class can't wear armor that is considered to be plate that provides stats and AC boosts similar to the plate wearing classes.<P>What the rangers gave up in order to double attack and dual wield was the ability to wear ALL kinds of plate.  What I mean by ALL are the types of plate that is most commonly found in all levels of play, from level 1 to level 60.  In turn, the ranger class received the ability to have near warrior offense with dual wield and double attack.  For the ranger this is a significant trade-off.  In pre-Kunark times there were only certain types of armor that a ranger could wear, simply because the armor was so severely limited in selection.  There just were so few sets of armor on the rack, if you will, that anyone could wear.  The ranger was limited in the armor they could wear out of this selection.  Essentially they had their banded armor, their quest armor, their planes armor, and rubicite (while it dropped).<P>Throughout most of the pre-kunark days the hybrids and warriors had roughly the same HP.  The ranger was the only one that showed a marked difference in HP.  The ranger also showed a marked difference in AC.  Their spells were quite weak and didn't make up the disparity.<P>Nonetheless the ranger community always acted as a tank.  They pulled mobs, taunted off the other classes, including the warrior.  Pre-Kunark I always taunted, regardless of whether we had a warrior in the group.  Every ranger I knew did the same thing.  There was never a time when we didn't consider ourselves to be a tank.  When someone called for a tank, rangers were selected, not by their classes' inherent tanking abilities but on how the person played their class.  Were they experienced?  Were they mature?  Did they have a bad reputation?  But never, was a ranger excluded (if they were experienced, mature and had a good reputation) as a tank.  They just weren't excluded.  A ranger could use some of their skill and spells and stand up just like a warrior, SK, or Paladin could.<P>Now we move into the realm of post-kunark.  From the release of the expansion most of the more mature and experienced rangers saw a problem.  They would sit in battle and get the **** beat out of them.  They would try to get out of the fight and the mobs would pursue.  They would enter the battle later then the others and the mobs would pursue.  They would cast their spells near the end of the battle and the mobs would pursue.  The rangers were trying everything to be able to remain effective in battle.  Some even suggested that the rangers give up their class defining skills to become more survivable.<P>Keep in mind that this all happened overnight.  It wasn't something that was progressive and showed a maturing of a class into something else, something better.  It was a dramatic change that caused signficiant failure of the ranger class to be effective and survivable in the post kunark world.<P>When this happened someone identified that the ranger class has problems, specifically with defense and with HP.  It was also noted that warrior classes were receiving armor with spells on them that rivaled the spells of the ranger and most certainly the spells on the class armor they were to get.<P>Aradune came on and told the ranger community to have patients and see what level 60 brought them.  One of the players from FoH (Elderan) decided he would use his other accounts and power-level his ranger to 60.  He hit level 60 just before a solo necro hit level 60.  During this time he played his game in a nomal fashion, participating in his guild events and collecting his Tolans armor and other gear.  When he finally hit level 60 he came on and posted what his concerns were with the game only to be out-right attacked by Abashi.<P>The conclusions he drew then still hold today.  The ranger class has problems all the way to level 60.  One of the most notable things was that the ranger's AC and HP didn't go up as drammatically as the other hybrids did nor how the warrior classes did.  It became apparent that the ranger was suffering and that the suffering was something that was dropped on them like a bomb in the night.<P>Many threads were started in support and debate of the conclusions that Elderan came up with.  As other players moved up near level 60 they also concluded the same thing.  Some minor changes were made but most of them were rather off-base and didn't bring the ranger class any closer to balance.<P>The most notable was that the ranger defense was suffering terribly.  Comparative reviews were done for all classes of players (hybrids, warriors, monks, rogues, and even casters (as the ranger has some DD and other buff spells)).  In these cases severe disparities were discovered and they were applicable only to the post-kunark expansions.<P>As time went by and the epic quests were implemented and the slaying of trak and other dragons became a regular things, it became notable that the rangers were excluded from them.  They didn't have enough staying power and the amount of resources they were eating up wasn't equal to the amount of value they added to the groups, even the best rangers were treated in like fasion.<P>Somewhere in this series of debates someone (not a Verant representative), but some player, started saying that the ranger class wasn't a tank.  Others debated whether the ranger had actually undergone a forced role change.  Most of the rangers participating in these fought the notion that the ranger was no longer a tank and rejected the forced role change.<P>Alas, though, nothing can deter the ranger class from being the tank that it is.  The ranger is a tank, has always been a tank, and always will be a tank.  Period.  It is only Verant's lack of focus and insight that has led to many of the changes that have fought to pull the ranger out of melee.  This is a bad thing.  Groups are looking for tanks and to limit the ranger's role as something other then a tank is what is hurting their desire in groups.  If the ranger isn't a tank, they what are they?  They don't do the damage you think.  Just today I saw a snapshot on one of our guild's message boards showing one of our level 59 paladins scoring a crit of 185 against CT in Fear.  It shows me and supports what I have said many times in the past, the other hybrids, with the right weapons can do some awesome damage.  Rangers on the other hand do small amounts of damage fast, but totaling them up they don't justify the disparity of AC/HP to offensive capabilities.  It shows also that the ranger class just isn't the damage dealing powerhouses that some have depicted the ranger as.  They don't do the damage the rogue does, not even close.  They don't do the damage the monks do, not even close, and both of those classes have signficantly higher ATK and AC then the ranger class has.  In other words, if the ranger isn't a tank, then what are they.<P>Verant said that the ranger, if they were getting slaughtered, they should pull themselves out of battle and cast their spells.  This was supposed to provide them with a viable alternative to melee damage (but the fact remains that the rangers gave up plate to get dual wield and double attack).  The next thing Verant said was that rangers should pull themselves out of battle and shoot their bow (they postulated this even though the ranger's had already stated that Archery wasn't contributing in any noticeable way to the damage done to a mob during battle--and the fact that Archery had far too many other limitations and restrictions to make it worthwhile)--and Verant returned saying that they would implement double damage for rangers, but there would be serious restrictions/limitations on it.  The ranger would have to be 51+, would have to not snare or root the mob, the mob couldn't be moving, and there were line of sight issues.  The last thing they did was nerf the trueshot discipline thus all but eliminating the only nice thing about archery.  The only thing I, as well as most other rangers could conclude, was that these attempts to extricate the ranger from arms length melee was only hurting their ability to produce damage and to bring value to the groups they were in.  It wasn't providing the group with anything additional.  In fact, these changes made the groups less effective overall.<P>In the case of the spell casting, it was uncovered that the ranger class, as well as the other hybrids, didn't have the mana to sustain any type of combat with their spells.  At some point Verant decided that it was a double and even tripple penalty to limit the hybrid mana pool by causing them to have less mana per WIS/INT stat point.  This penalty they removed.  There still remains a penalty on spell casting, actually several.  The first is that it costs the hybrid more mana per cast of a spell then the parent class costs for the same spell.  The second is that the hybrids have no specalization for casting, and the third is that since the hybrids are all tanks they are fighting all the time and have little time to regen their mana back.  This in the end signficantly reduces the effectiveness of pulling the ranger out of battle to cast spells.  Almost completely negates it.  As well, the fact that spells have high agro modifiers it causes the mobs to turn on them.  Since lower HP is also an agro modifier the lack of HP and the spell casting gets the rangers into trouble more times then not.<P>Verant continued, and continues today in trying to get the ranger out of melee.  This doesn't mean that this is a good decision on their part.  It seems to have forced all rangers to change the way they played.  For 5/6th of their lives they played a tank and to date, they want to remain a tank.<P>I want to remain a tank.  Fix the defense issues of the ranger.  There's no reason I have to be so significantly behind the other melee classes, including the rogue and the monk.  There's no reason my ranger's defense skill, at level 60 should equal the defensive skill of a level 60 druid or shaman.<P>I want to also say that many of the changes to spells, many of which I like, except the low level ones, do nothing to balance the ranger class in any way.<P>My first char was a ranger and my last char will be a ranger.  Fix the damn class Verant.<P>54 Ranger<BR>55 Wizard<BR>56 Necro<BR>51 Bard<BR>50 Warrior<BR>Innoruuk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>So far I have been impressed with much of the ranger talk.  But I have a few ideas to present.<P>- Ranger defense skill raised to 230.  Mirror Pally/sk offensive skill based on warriors. I’m tired of being made fun of because the rogue that I’m grouped with has 100 ac over me, yet I’m the "tank"  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>- Track upgrades.  Scroll bar and possible "track players only" for PvP servers. If we can decide to track only mobs, why can't decide to track only players?  The ranger tracking as it stands is weak compared to bard/druid tracking.  Our tracking barely changes because of our large radius.  A good example of this was a few months back while in Trak Teeth hunting for the Hunter/Forager.  I spent over 3 hours attempting to find them, however no matter where I went in the zone my tracking wouldn't really change.<P>- Increase Sky belts to at least fbss haste (21%) from the 15% it grants now.  This doesn't make much sense to me why the sky belts are so much lower in the first place.  If it takes 30 or so people and a number of sky runs to obtain a Belt of the Pine, it should grant at least the same haste as an item that is obtainable by a smart necro/enchanter soloing.  The AC and stats are nice, but I don’t think they are enough when compared to the risk vs. reward.  If rangers are supposed to be all offensive, then the haste they receive should be at least equal to the monk/rouge/warrior haste granted by the belts obtained in sky.  I can understand the Pally/Sk belts being lower because they are a defensive hybrid, but not the ranger one. <P>-  Regeneration should be a level 49 ranger spell.  What sense does it make to give us Chloroplast at 55, yet never grant us basic regeneration?  Druids get regeneration at level 34, and choloroplast is granted at level 44.  At 52 rangers obtain a level 39 Druid spell, Firestrike.  At level 53 rangers obtain a level 44 spell, Storm Strength.  I do see why regeneration was not given to rangers in the first place.<P>- Make Jolt a lower level spell.  50 hits my ear just right, since that’s when the "high level game" begins.  Rangers shouldn't have to go though 5 levels of being over taunted, and then suddenly at 55 receive this useful spell.  Also lower resist rates, or add a higher level version of jolt.  Maybe this higher level version could be level 55, and move the version that is game now to 50.  The rangers between 50-54 would appreciate this greatly.<P>- Replace level 54 Drones of doom, with the druid level 44 dot, Drifting death.  The damage output of drones of doom is sad to say the least at the level rangers obtain it.  The damage dealt by the dot can be easily obtained in 2 rounds of melee. <P>- Increase drop rate of Call of Earth.  This spell is great and would be very useful, yet its drop rate is to low.  By the time a ranger obtains this level 50 spell, he/she will probably already be 55+. <P>- Add Endure Magic at 53.  Ranger equipment has very poor resist magic stats.  Druids obtain this spell at level 34.  One spell at level 53 seems lacking considering every other level has 2-3 spells.  This spell would be quite useful to rangers, and seeing as how rangers obtain some of the 34-44 druid spells around this time, it seems fitting.  <P>- Lower the level required for Greater Healing.  Most level 29 druid spells are learned by 51.  Yet rangers have to wait until 57 to obtain this level 29 druid spell.  Rangers only heal from 39-57 is Healing, which heals around 90 hit points.  If I'm healing myself from around 200 or so hp, it takes me a few minutes to reach full hit points, even with just standing and constantly recasting the healing spell. Druids will soon have their healing powers increased, increasing the healing power of the ranger would seem to make sense along with it.  Lower level will also decrease the failure rate of casting. <P>- A questionable cold based spell at 49, like call of flame, is a great idea (to quote a previous post).  Sounds like a great idea to me.<P>- Increase Parry Dodge and Riposte to around that of warrior levels.  If rangers are supposed to be agile fighters, I think with their agility they should also be able to avoid combat attacks, along with counter/black them much better than what they are currently able.<P>- Possible introduction of a higher level AGI buff.  Feet like cat is a wonderful spell, let’s see an upgrade to it.  <P>- With all our new Call of sky/fire spells, it would be nice to also receive a DEX buff to make these spells more efficient.  Normally I will proc around once a fight, which if dealing with call of sky is a weak 35 damage.  I sometimes decide to cast one Call of flame for the mana it takes, as opposed to recast the same low proc’ing buff every 10 or so minutes.  <P>This is all I can come up with for now, hopefully you will seriously consider some of my ideas.  I look forward to see future discussion of the ranger class.  The improvements as of late have been wonderful and has increased the amount of fun I have playing my ranger.<P>Diabolik Blakthorn<BR>Rallos Zek<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is what I think would be cool to make rangers be able to do. Ragers are the damage dealing hybrids, and I agree with that. With a couple DD's and a dots, with minor buff and healing, I think the spells are fine. We do damage with our weapon nicely, and dual wield is great. There is one probelem I really need to comment on. That is archery.<P>I abslutely HATE archery right now, and I'm supposed to be a ranger. All I use it for is pulling, and that isn't much, when I could do more damage with a dd pulling. There needs to be a way to improve archery without contributing THAT much to kiting, although whatever you do to make archery better, it will in some way make kiting better. This idea in my opinion would make us a lot of fun to play, and have an easier time finding a group with (I have been rejected into groups because of being a ranger).<P>Make rangers the "monks" of the hybrids. Monks have the ability to tiger claw and flying kick, and other special abilities. So, instead of giving ranger something like HT or LH, give us special archery skills, like a monk, that come back every few minutes or so. A few Ideas would be "head shot", which gives an instant crit. "Stunning blow" which does more damage than a regular arrow and stuns the enemy for a few seconds. "Rapid fire" which could shoot 2 or 3 arrows in a row. <P>Archery NEEDS to be changed, VERY BADLY! Please take this idea into consideration, or at least make archery better the best you can.<P>And get rid of this too close or to far above/below you crap.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have two issues which I believe haven't been mentioned yet. Both are in regards to stacking.<P>My ranger DoTs Stinging Swarm and Flamelick prevent the upgrades to those spells from sticking. If I pull with flamelick and a druid goes to cast immolate on the mob it won't stick. If I cast Stinging Swarm on a mob a Druid can't get a Drones of Doom to stick. I'm refering only to pre level 50 druid DoTs as the post 50 DoTs stack with pre 50 DoTs.<P>Higher level DoTs of the same faimily should overwrite lower level ones. Thats is Immolate should overwrite flame lick and drones of doom should overwrite stinging swarm.<P>Also my ranger uses Ebony Blades. These fine weapons proc Ensnaring Roots, a level 24 druid root. If I root a mob with Grasping Roots, level 5 druid root, my sword's Ensnaring Roots will not take hold. <P>Again shouldn't the higher version of the spell overwrite the lower version?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Agreed Thryll, the Ranger class is and will be a "tank", a "light tank" but still a tank.  This means we should take hits better than a Rogue, let alone better than casters.  Currently we do not.<P>Yes, Knights should take hits better and tank longer with less effort by the healer.  But we should be the next best behind them.<P>This is why the triple-penalty (AC, HP, Defense) makes no sense.<P>We paid for lack of AC (non-Plate armor) with Dual-Wield.  Somehow that got turned into lack of HP and lack of Defense as well, once Kunark came out.  These are not justifiable extensions.<P>I'd really like to see a defensible argument from Verant to the contrary, if such a thing exists.<P>This is why this subject keeps coming up over and over again.  It's time to accept the extra AC on Knight armor is good (and fine, I'll accept them having higher Defense, but not higher Dodge and Parry -- Riposte should be equal since it has an offensive component).<P>But I do not support a significant reduction in HP, I do not support 200 Defense, and I do not support having some 47+ armor pieces with AC equal to or lower than Druid, Shaman and other caster armor.<P>Please take some time to think this argument over, and maybe discuss it a little, before dismissing it immediately.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've read a lot of posts about the situation post level 50, which honestly mean nothing to me. I don't even know if I want to play Everquest that long. Similiarily level 39 seems a long, long way away.<P>The things that concern me are:<P>Archery: (for all the above reasons.)<BR>Tracking: (for all the above reasons.)<P>SoW: A class defining skill of being good at traveling, that isn't granted until two thirds of the character's career has already elasped.<P>Fair enough, SoW is a big attraction for players to group with Shamans and Druids, and I don't want to tread on their toes, since I also play a Shaman and a Druid. But there should be some travel enchancement ability or spell, thats self-only, and switches off at the start of combat, granted no later than the mid-teens. Because getting to the mid-teens is no small thing for the first time non-twinked player, but level 39 is just too, too far away.<P>Just to explain why I came to EQ with the pre-conception that Rangers were these wanders and travelling warriors, I'll quickly quote the passage from 'Lord Of The Rings' (The book which pretty much founded today's Fantasy genre.)<P>"Who is that?" Frodo asked, when he got a chance to whisper to Mr. Butterbur. "I don't think you introduced him?"<BR>"Him?" said the landlord in an answering whisper, ****ing an eye without turning his head. "I don't rightly know. He is one of the wandering folk - Rangers we call them. He seldom talks: not but what he can tell a rare tale when he has the mind. He disappears for a month, or a year, and then he pops up again. He was in and out pretty often last spring; but I haven't seen him about lately. What his right name is I've never heard: but he's known round here as Strider. Goes about at a great pace on his long shanks; though he don't tell nobody what cause he has to hurry. But there's no accounting for East and West, as we say in Bree, meaning the Rangers and the Shire-folk, begging your pardon. Funny you should ask about him."<P>So basically a wandering hero, who's at home in the wilderness, and who can shift some leagues when he needs to.<BR>To take it further: Its generally accepted that your light infantry scrimisher can move freely  and quickly through tough terrain without penalty.<BR>We should be natural born hunters and scouts in the outdoors. Its something that would make us more desirable to groups in our choosen environment, because, not every potentional group has a druid or a shaman along.<P>Binding: a class defining attribute of the Ranger is that we're the out door type.<P>Fair enough, I'm not saying we should have the ability to bind ourselves, which would tread on the caster's toes. But, we should be able to be bound away from cities. It's wrong for a character which is supposed to be at home in the wilderness, to be wary of venturing out into it, for fear of a long and tedious corpse run. Once again, this would make us more desirable to groups in our choosen environment.<P>See Invisible: (for all the above reasons.)<BR>Sneak and Hide: (for all the above reasons.)<P>In conclusion: <P>We're not supposed to be as good at close quarter fighting as the plate clad fighters. But we should be wanted by groups for those abilities that we excell at.<P>Faeyd.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A local EQ player read my thoughts that hybrids should be left alone.  He sent me an email, and invited me over last weekened to watch him play his 50+ ranger AND paladin.<P>A really great guy, that wanted me to see the concerns of his classes, and that there really are changes that need to happen.<P>I WAS BLOWN AWAY..  I was wrong all along...<P>Hybrids do have major issues.  I always assumed, a ranger in full thorney vine was basically the same as a warrior.  I was very wrong, and I will glady admit it.  I always thought a paladin  was uber in every way.  I was wrong, and I will  admit it.  Paladins have major issues.<P>My thoughts.<P>1) Paladins need major upgrades on their defense AND offense abilities AND spells.<P>My friend insists on using a 2HS (Soulfire), because hes a true paladin roleplayer, and feels that paladins always use 2HS weapons.  Anyway, I couldn't believe the pathetic damage this "Once Uber" weapon was doing!  The guy would only hit very rarely in the hundreds, and most of the time was doing 30-40 per hit, some as low as 16.  With the SLOOOOOOWWWWNESS of the weapon, why isn't their a big 2HS damage modifier?  Say if a given weapon is over 40 delay and 2HS, then the given damage should have a minimum of say 40+, with a damage modifier of say 150+ on the top end maybe, even add special damage crits for users of 2HS weapons.  Given the fact that a big sword, swung with two hands, should land with some serious force.  Once uber weapons like Skarlon, Soulfire, Flamberge, are now relegated to banks, because one handed weapons from Kunark are way better.  This is pretty wrong in my view.  After testing it, and watching him, its way wrong.<P>Warriors are super great, but paladins need upgrades in defense and offense(if using 2hs weapons).  Warriors will always be great - fear not, but Paladins need boosts, it was evident from watching him in battle in comparison to when I played a warrior to 50+.<P>Paladins need better spells, better buffs, and better disciplines in my opinion.  My friend was in full Valorium, and had AC well under 900.  Armor that was once considered Uber, and very rare, has now lost its status symbol for the most part.  Why not upgrade Valorium/Thorney Vine as part of the class balance? Add a couple points of AC to each piece or something.  The stuff is harder to get than Deepwater/Tolans, and deserves some respect.<P>As for his ranger, full thorney vine, AC wasn't close to 900.  His hitpoints were about 1500ish, about the same as a necro of the same level with nice gear. Rangers need offense?  I think not.  He got tanked HARD already in battle, and could seldom use his taunt key.  Defensive increase? BIG TIME.  HP increase? BIG TIME.  Rangers are considered a tank class, right?   Well, upgrade their HP a bit, just under a paladin, well under a warrior, but still more than a caster.  Ranger spells are good from what I noted, and I don't think they need adjustments other than whats coming from Test.<P>So in summation, i'd say:<P>Paladins:<BR>Better Spells<BR>More Defense/Higher Caps (defense(ac),dodge,parry, etc)<BR>2HS Damage Modifier for roleplayers that use 2HS.<BR>Valorium Upgrade (couple more AC per piece?)<P>Rangers:<BR>Upgrades to Hitpoints<BR>Slightly increased defense/skill caps.<BR>Thorney Vine Upgrade (couple more AC per piece)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>On another note, I did a little anaysis on the AC ratings on the best gear avaliable to the different Wis casters 46+ (planar) and 51+ (karnor & seb).<P>Rangers in full Thorny vine vs full Tolan's as compared to Druids, Shamans and Clerics.  Also Included in the numbers are the other items usable by the class that while are not part of the class specific armour set, enhance AC in other slots (shields, neckguards, masks, etc.).  If a class has more than one piece of armour available to them for a slot, the one with the highest AC was used.<P>Each class was maxed out for AC and all known armour drops included, rarity not considered.<P>Planar gear AC (PoF, PoH):<P>Druid- 91 <BR>Ranger- 110<BR>Shaman- 111<BR>Cleric- 147 <P>AC from Class Kunark (Seb and Karnor)<BR>Druid- 90<BR>Ranger- 183<BR>Shaman- 211<BR>Cleric- 227 <P>What I don't understand here is how Shaman's end up getting more AC than us, significantly more by Kunark levels.  I'm not saying nerf them or anything, but it is a bitter pill to swallow as a melee class that 2 of the caster wis classes end up having more AC than us.  <P>On the topic of Kunark armour, some of the effects really need to be looked at for all classes.  Like Stinging Swarm for Ranger arms (I think(??  120 Damage over 60 seconds?  Oooo yea, the 40k hp nasty is gonna run in terror ~_^.  If you don't want to mke it more powerful, change it to a DoT effect that will stack with our naturally casting 120 damage over 60 seconds, and then we will real rule the world =P<P>This is all moot at any rate.  My original point was that despite the Ranger's supposed ability to dish out fast damage, we can't becuase we argo too fast.  Theoretically, a Ranger should be able to dish out more damage per battle than a SK or Pally, and we could, if we could stay in the battle.  But since we can't stay in the battle, why are we giving up all the stats for the ability to deal the damage? <P>That's what is wrong with Rangers.  We give up a lot of stats and accept armour with lower AC's than Clerics and Shamans, and our trade-off (ability to dish out the damage) for these restrictions is not viable in any grouping situation. <P>We don't want to be the main tank.  We don't even want to be a secondary tank.  We would be more than happy (or I would at least) to keep our 200 def cap if we are given Jolt at 45, and adjust the spell so it becomes more reliable by level.  <P><BR>Tunare Bless, <P>Dedolito Ginnoyumi<BR>Queen of Death<BR>Transcendent (A.Ro)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Rangers are wizards of the tank class - This is Verants view.  Unfortunely, this view spells certain death to all rangers with magic resist rates in which the jolt spell at lvl 55 will be worthless.<P>I keep thinking Verant vision of a Ranger is being a wizard of the tank class. <P>Wizards are suppose to be all Offense with little to no Defense.  I believe Verant view of Rangers is virtually identical in it's reasoning.  Rangers are all offense with little to no defense.<P>Why on earth would they increase our offensive capability equal to that of warriors that is currently being tested on test server.  When at the same time we are lacking in defensive skills to all the other tank classes in the game as it is from pre Kunark on the score of 50 less points then anybody else.  Current defense cap for rangers is 200 while all others is around 250.  There are NO reported changes to the defense on the test server at all.  They are increasing the gap between offensive and defensive capabilities of a ranger instead of decreasing.<P>I believe this formula is going to spell certain doom for the Ranger class.<P>It is reported that most monsters in the lvl 50+ range are more magic resistant than anything else.  Which means the supposed jolt spell at lvl 55, which comes to late for the hell rangers go thru from lvl 50 to 55.  Is not going to work on these monsters most of the time or not at all due to being resisted.  The magic resistance that these monsters in the lvl 50+ range have is due to the result of making a spell casters job harder or impossible.  <P>This principle concept of making rangers the wizard version of tanks is a disaster in the making.  Unlike wizards who do not touch the monsters in anyway except by magic.  Rangers have to be in melee range and attacking the monsters directly.  Since most monster agro is done via melee this means that rangers are going to be the prime source of agro for a monster.  Since we have no means to defend ourselves because we are equal to wizards in the fact of no defense.  We are a sitting duck to die and being a mana sink to clerics or other healers.  The jolt spell comes too late for when the rangers need it the most which is at lvl 50.  There is no sure way to eliminate the agro that rangers have on the monsters unless the taunt skills of the other classes are increased.  Rangers have to stop fighting currently to try to eliminate the agro which defeats the purpose of having a ranger in a group setting.  This defeats the purpose of having a ranger being useful in a group setting.  The defense of the ranger needs to be addressed, not the offense.  Rangers offensive capability is already over bearing and doesn't need to be addressed but Defense needs to be addressed.<P>One more point to consider when it comes to wizards versus rangers.  This point is pretty basic as to how simular we rangers are to wizards when it comes to armor drops.<P>Planer armor - Drops from 7 monsters called tentical terrors in Fear plane.  The Wizard class also has it's armor drop in fear plane from 7 monsters called Fright Fingers.  The drop rate on both armors is the lowest in the everquest game.  This has also not been looked at and probably won't be.  However, since most rangers in the general population don't have this armor except for elites in elite guilds who got all the plane armor before the drop rates were nerfed.  <P>Ixcor Blackthorne<BR>Lvl 53 Pathfinder<P>Ixcorian D'eltaire<BR>Lvl 52 Vicar<P>Ixcutus <BR>Lvl 19 Wizard<P>Forgotten Alliance Guild<BR>Bertox Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Not sure if this has been brought up already, don't have time to read all the posts, heh. I am a cleric [main], and as a cleric, I must say that rangers need some help in the defensive area or something. They make my life as a cleric hell, they lose hp so fast and so easily its like they lose hp without being hit, it's amazing! Lets say a ranger needs a group, and we need another "melee" class, I will say, "Please guys, not a ranger." I have talked about this and other clerics agree, rangers are hard on us unless there is a great warrior to keep the mob off the ranger.  I have a few suggestions, but one my ranger guildies seemed to like the best was some sort of special regeneration. No matter how much I buff the ranger, I can never really rely on getting a complete heal off in time, and it takes so much of my mana having to Divine light a ranger 2, sometimes even 3 times! Ok, the regeneration...lets say the ranger is being beat on pretty badly, as the rangers life goes down, his special regeneration kicks in, and the quicker his life goes down, the faster the regen ticks are, or the more hitpoints it regens, etc. Or, about the time a warrior would normally go berserk [approx. 1.75 bubbles], a ranger would start his special regen that somehow allowed me the time to finish casting complete heal on them. As soon as they hit a certain point in their hp (maybe 2.5 bubbles) their regeneration returns to normal. Also, it might cancel out any regeneration buffs they have on them to help with the whole "too powerful" issue. As of right now, I think rangers aren't being grouped because they are so harsh on the mana, I'd rather have any other class most consider melee than a ranger  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> sorry all you rangers out there. But if something was done to help with the heals, I'd love to have a ranger in all my groups. Just my thoughts.

</FONT><HR>***Earthcall Proc***<BR>Something else we need to have considered is returning the Earthcall proc to it's original state with a clause put in. The reason I say this is now the Earthcall proc is an all or nothing meaning if you proc and then a shaman or enchanter land a slow it erases your slow AND your DoT. Basically taking something away that would be very valauble to a group and add to our group value (which we always need). The original slow was 70% (estimated) if that is indeed true then there is no other slow remotely close to that and having it returned would be a great addition to our value. The clause that I see that would make it all viable would be an overwrite clause having the original Earthcall only overwrite other classes slow spells that are inferior and not the ones that are stronger in a sense. In that light a player could slow a mob and then IF a Ranger with the Earthcaller procced it would be an added bonus. As it stands now Earthcall is a 50% slow (estimated) and a 500 dmg DoT and almost every slow another class casts overwrites it. That is effectively shooting ourselves(the players) in the foot with every mob engaged. So to trim it up here is what I would like to see added to our want list: <P>**Return Earthcall to it's original state and only have it overwrite inferior slow spells and at the same time have Earthcall overwritten by superior slow spells.** <P>This way we all contribute, if the mob is slowed then the class who slowed it did what they set out to do, IF we proc the earthcall then it's just icing on the cake which is good for EVERY group encounter.  This will add to our grouping/raiding desirability.  This (the proc) being reduced has reduced our desirability by a large margain indeed.  Please consider returning it (the proc) to it's original state.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I can live with the fact that SoW won't be lowered (it shouldn't be), but I ask for an explaination on why we can't have bind.<P>This is how I see things.  This is not a wish, it's is a class balance issue (albiet a minor one).  Bind/Gate is a low level caster spell that spans many classes.  As a hybrid, I would think that we would get them, perhaps as high as 39.  Honestly, I don't think that hybrids deserve gate.  And as a ranger, we don't have the special, once per hour abilities of the Paladin or Shadow Knight (class balance, they get a nifty skill).  Also, gating and binding is a defining ability of our parent class, the druid (class balance, how many people more people would be willing to play a ranger rather then some caster if they had bind?)  <BR>So please consider a once per game day self only bind in outdoor zones earned at a later level in the game.  If that is beyond consideration, could we get a brief explaination as to why?  <BR>I appreciate what is being discussed and given a chance.

There should also be a higher Variety of Ranger only Bows.<P>2) Remove Firestrike and put in a cold spell similar to Call of Flames, with a level 60 upgrade similar to Calefaction. We arent meant to be nukers, high dmg long cast spells see little or no use.<P>3) Eyes of the Cat. Maybe you should rename this spell to the "Human Rangers Only" spell. The ultravision spell gained at level 56 should replace eyes of the cat and at level 56 we should gain either Self only or targetable See Invis.<P>4) Archery. Should max out at 252, and be the only class that does.  I would also like to think that after 55 levels of using a bow my character has learned to shoot over a groupmates shoulder, as opposed to shooting him in the back.<P>5) Tracking. I recall something about a scroll bar and filters on tracking, are these still being implemented? Also need a transparent overlay of the Tracking box so that it doesnt constantly switch back to 640*480 resolution when playing in full screen.<P>6) an upgrade to Feet Like Cat would be nice.<P>Infernus Fireweaver<BR>Outrider of Karana<BR>Ashborne<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>my single most important concern?<P>The way that mobs deal with aggro and the hate list!<P>Some people believe that misses cause more aggro than hits do.  (try using a 1 hb with weapon skill near 0)  you'll quickly rack up more aggro than anyone else in the group.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I really would like you to review the reasoning behind why bows can't proc.  If you already changed it so they can, I suggest that having raincaller proc would be nice.  Charged item = an item with charges not used 99% of the time.<BR>ex.<BR>I have had a raincaller for a year - still full of charges.<BR>I have had 2 ivandyr's hoops before including current one - still full of charges.<P>Please review trueshot's damage formula, it was interesting when we were actually useful on raid-size mobs like VS.<P>New spell idea - if you want to add something unique to ranger, give us a 'spirit of wolf' type spell for the water,  only a few underwater dungeons but in those dungeons it would be very good to have a ranger then.<P>I would like more defense than shaman/druid/cleric.  It is rediculous to have bards/monks/shadowknights/warriors/paladins/rogues all at one level, and all the priests at another, and we are lumped with the priests.  Give us 15 or 20 more points and have us in the middle.  This is the only change I would want if you made me choose one.<P>Non-Ranger related: I agree that wizard and mage epic quests are a bit rediculously hard.  Perhaps change some of those 'once a week spawns' ?<P>Line of sight bow problems - the engine is very poor with this.  I almost always try to move up a slope a slight bit, say 2% angle above the mob just to avoid the ground and the arrows still go off into Nowhere Land somehow.<P>Are there plans to make ranger drops equivalent to those in Plane of Growth that we can use if we worship Karana?<P>TV drops - would agree with the above poster about them being less common than other classes.  More equality in # of drop-mobs please.<P>More defense is really all I think we need.<BR>For some reason the computer reads 200 defense as 'slay me' tag.  I would hope 220 would make a difference.  I am willing to give up other things for this, such as weapon skill caps even, however given pally/sk offense caps, I don't think we should have to.  They have 215 offense, we should have 215 defense.  If you disagree, explain why not please.<P>V<BR>51 Ranger<BR>E'ci<P><BR>Other non-ranger related fodder:<P>Sunmoon is cool.  Just mentioning that.<P>Absor, whatever you decided to do to improve on Abashi's on-board personality and persona--good job.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
