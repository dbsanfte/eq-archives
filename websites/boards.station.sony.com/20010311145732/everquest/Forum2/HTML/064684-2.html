</FONT><HR>Whenever a common noun is used to describe or label someone or something (usually a product), it becomes a proper noun. And if made up by someone to describe a fictional character (Gambit, Maverick) it can be copyrighted so the name can not be used to describe another fictional character. Same goes with products (Tide). And there are many instances of common nouns being used as proper nouns, for example bill- a note of a debt, and Bill, short for either William, Billy, or just plain Bill. <BR>Now as for your name Gambit being changed, Verant had every right to do it. Because the name is copyrighted by Marvel for use of a fictional character, to describe that character, and it pertains to the 'image and reputation' of that character. And thus since your character is also a fictional character that steps into the copyright laws for fictional work. Using the dictionary was a bad attempt at trying to justify your name, when in fact the name as you were using it was proper. And therefore just saved someone some petition work  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>bellicus,<P>You are almost right about copyright but are wrong about how it applies here.  Consider the following:<P> 1. Gambit, the EQ character, is *not* a fictional character.  He is a persona for a real person.  He is not part of a story being sold for profit.  If Gambit were an EQ npc, then there'd be trouble.<P> 2. Copyright doesn't protect the name (that's what trademarks are for), copyright protects the 'look and feel' or, as you put it, the 'image and reputation' of the character.  Thus, as long as it can be shown there is no relationship between the two characters sharing the same name, there is no copyright violation.  Gambit, the EQ character, does not throw high energy cards pulled from his sleeve, he doesn't speak with a French accent (I presume), he doesn't look like the X-Man, etc.  He doesn't pretend to bare any relation to the X-Man character.  Thus, no copyright violation.<P> 3. Most importantly, copyright means absolutely nothing unless the copyright-holder is losing revenue from the alleged violation.  Marvel loses no revenue from Gambit, the EQ character, having that name.<P><BR>Oh yah:<BR>"Tezcatlipoca" and "Mictlantecuhtli" were Aztec gods (not Incan or Mayan).<BR>"Paracelsus" was the assumed named of the most famous Renaissance alchemist.<BR>"Temujin" was Genghis Khan's actual name, he was Kublai Khan's grandson (hehe, close).<BR>"Sakhayit" was the name of a powerful Mongol tribe.<BR>"Tchort" is the contemporary Russian name for the Devil.  Originally, the father of the gods, turned into the Devil by crusaders.<BR>"Perun" is the Polish name for "Pyerun", the Russian god of war.<BR>"Zorya" is the Russian goddess of night.<BR>"Glasya" is the name of one of Satan's daughters.<BR>"Bure", "Rofocale", "Furfur" and "Bael" are four of the 76 demons imprisoned in jars and thrown into the sea by King Solomon.<BR>"Baal-Shebub" was a Punic god, corrupted to "Beelzebub".<BR>"Baal" was the Punic word for "Lord" or "God", demonised by the Christians.<P>This was just a random assortment of names that came to mind.  I did, at one time, have an Iksar Shaman named "Tezcatlipoca" (name means "Smoking Mirror", god of jaguars, evil and the night) but recently deleted him.<P>So it seems whether your name gets culled or not depends on the knowledge of the GM.  Kinda random if you ask me.<P>Yzzy</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You could have a Marvel dry cleaners. That is because the industry that company is in does not interfere with Marvel comics nor can confuse people with Marvel Comics. And does not impose on Marvel Comics status as a company. Now if this Marvel Dry Cleaners falsly alluded to being affiliated with Marvel Comics, and a customer had a problem with the cleaners and therefore took it up with Marvel Comics, and thus attempted to ruin their name. Marvel Comics could take action against the cleaners for using their name for a 'false' affilation. And perhaps even take legal action, and use the name copyright as a valid argument.<BR>Now as for EQ characters, all characters are in Verants world, which is a work of fiction. Any characters created within are Verants property, be it likeness and what not. And own all rights to use that character how they see fit. Good example is when a person creates a character for Marvel comics, they create the character, but Mavel has all rights and owns that character. <BR>Verant therefore can not use or sustain a character named Gambit (or as his real name is Remy LeBeau, Marvel owns all 3 names), nor Drizzt, or any other fictional character's name that already exists. Because it infringes on the other companies copyright of said fictional characters. That is unless rights to the copyright are bought to be used in the EQ universe. Which could be possible, but there would be strict guidelines from Marvel as to how they can use the name and likeness of Gambit. And without permission, Verant can get sued for copyright infrignment. Even if just a name is used. The likeness is secondary. And if this PC Gambit is a rogue, then Verant could even lose the case, because Gambit in the Marvel universe was a thief. Therfore the Gambit EQ character would strike more of a likeness to the Marvel character.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

And the player may not be making money off the name. But Verant is making money from the player that is using the name. Therefore technically someone is making money out of this.

</FONT><HR>First off, the fact that the name may be copyrighted is no excuse for Verant to consistently harrass their customers about using it in the context of the game.  It doesn't wash.<BR>Copyright laws only apply to the promotion of the organization resposible for creation and ongoing conduct of the game and doesn't even apply to Absor.  The only place where it applies is in the naming of the creatures and NPCs within the game itself, the programming, OR within the advertisements promoting the game.<P>Secondly, VI is correct in saying that names which create phrases that are unacceptable should be looked into, but ONLY in the cases of profanity or references to adult activities which young children should not be exposed to. <P>A name like Chekitout Sellingbeer should not violate their policy but it does...this merely shows too many personal problems with the people in charge of creation of the naming policy.<P>This is the extent that VI should interfere with the customer.  My reasons for this is that other people who are friends of the character over a long time playing have just had that player removed from their respective friends list.  Also, others who think you are an idiot have you on their /ignore list..and now those lists are invalid.<P>Thirdly, the Guides responsible for checking and correcting the character names in 'violation' are the lowest breed of Verant representatives.  There is no question that the volunteers with the lowest intelligence are assigned this duty, and many of you have had personal experience with this I'm sure.<P>In my case, I had a Bard with the name Bravesirrobin.  Now, while I'm in combat with a partner in Highkeep, I'm contacted by one of these guides and informed my name is being changed...poof...my partner goes linkdead and I'm suddenly heavily lagged.  When I respond to the issue after it clears, I get a snotty remark that I need to review the naming policy before creating the character.  I simply responded that my attourney wasn't available at the time and that I wouldn't be able to function under their silly California laws until such time as he WAS available.  Now, my name COULD have been...Bravesurrobin, or Braveserrobin without violating the policy...but the incompetant guide makes me Robinsong, certainly not a male name to say the least.  As a result of the whole incident, my partner was killed because my heal song wouldnt work on him and I was nearly killed...for no other reason than some idiot guide got a bug up their pipe about my character name and refused to help with the situation following their actions.<P>LOL typical of Verant's personalities!  To the public they cry JOIN US and sweet talk them, but once you are in the game they treat you like you are some kind of criminal, at the least as if you are some kind of idiot!<P>WORK ON IT VERANT<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>That does not make sense, Wizard Industries, Dwarf Furniture, &lt;shakes head&gt; those may be trademarked by law to prevent others from taking those names for business. Dwarf when used in everquest is the name of a race, and Wizard is the name of a class. Which make them adjectives because they describe that class/race.  It does not spefically pertain to one entity. Therefore that arguement does not hold. Good example same argument could be used if Verant had a jaguar monster, sure Jaguar is a car type and is trademarked also. But that retains to automobiles.

I agree that Gambit should be out, only if it was named after the character, Like Rouge Is an X-men but its also a class.. We are backing you up all the way.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064684-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064684.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064684-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064684-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064684-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=064684&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=064684&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
