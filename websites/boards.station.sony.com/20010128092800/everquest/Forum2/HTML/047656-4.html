</FONT><HR>Okay.. I've played many a class, and while the cleric is still my main, I see what you're getting at here.<BR>Yep, I can generally walk into just about any dungeon post 39, and get a group within the first 10-20 minutes. Is this fair? Not entirely. I agree, cleric's hold a monopoly on the grouping process. Why is this? NOT ENOUGH CLERIC'S.<BR>No, it is not because Druid's, or Shaman's, or some other such class is so vastly underpowered in the healing department as to render them useless in a group. I love having Druid's, as well as Shaman's in my group. However, since there are probably a 20:1 ratio of druid's to cleric's of the same (as in post 40) level on any given server, this somewhat screws over druids.<BR>Answer -- Do not start up and twink yourself a n00b druid, and then complain about how you can't get groups after you're done soloing at high twenties.<BR>So, while that may or may not address what you're getting at, let me point out yet another small fact.<BR>Druid's, as they stand, are one of the two classes in the game that are considered a "good" soloing class, due to their "kiting" ability. Ever seen a cleric quad kite dwarf's in butcherblock? Didn't think so. So, let's not nerf cleric's, we'll just give druid's SHeal. &lt;begin sarcasm&gt; Sure, then when they get their asses kicked, we can let them heal themselves more efficently then before. Sounds like a good way to discourage soloing to me. &lt;/end sarcasm&gt; Listen guys, I know it sounds bad, I know it is not practical, especially for those level 30+ druids out there who have put time into their character. But the only way to fix this, is to be a cleric. Cleric's can not solo. I restarted mine, as a twink, and barely managed to solo to 18 (just to avoid grouping with complete n00bs.) We can nuke, huh? Yeah, yeah we can... My 29 spell does 200 some odd damage.. Rather strong, for a healing class. Of course, take into account that it takes about 2 bubbles of mana to cast, or roughly 3/4 the amount of an SHeal... Duh, what's more efficent here? Letting your warrior do the damage, and healing him with SHeal, or nuking and losing all your mana?<BR>If you want to whine, be my guest, but please, start to think of the reprocussions before throwing out an "idea."<BR>I can just see it now..<BR>A_Kewl_d00d_00 tells you, "Hey man, can I get a rez over in Karnor's?"<BR>/who<BR>There are 42 players in Thurgadin.<BR>You tell A_Kewl_d00d_00, "Sure thing, just let me port over there, and I'll get right on it..."<P>You cannot expect us to hand you our spells, without a few in return, it's only fair...<P>Sheesh guys.. Go fight in an outdoor zone and hug some trees if you don't like it. Otherwise, go play a cleric, and just watch our awesome dr00id soloing skillz come into effect. At 40, I could not solo a greater kobold, single, at full mana, and totally buffed. Hmm... Yeah, solo to 50 alright...<P>Darwinain sighs, clearly disapointed.<BR>/hug a_dr00id_d00d_00<P>Lighten up guys, and make the best of the class you have.<P>Darwinain Seafarer<BR>Cleric of the Gyn Cadley Reejeryn<BR>Lanys T'Vyl</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think original question has merit and I would be interested in the VI position on this.<P>Clerics, sensible clerics, Im sure can see that they are 1000 times more effective as healers post 50 than shaman/druid/pally(everyone leaves outpallies). <BR>This is the case, a druid can scrape by as main healer up until 50ish, then all of a sudden be useless in this sense.  This does not seem consistent with EQ VisionTM. Clerics will always be in demand due to res and it leaves the other classes to carry out functions they are more efficient at. But should 12 people sit at a zone, useless because there are 2 druids 2 shaman but no clerics? No ! We should be able to proceed with caution but proceed! Currently we cannot. <BR>If there were ENOUGH high lvl clerics this wouldnt be a problem but for some reason(maybe cus its boring) there arent enough of you. So please clerics, dont get upset when we ask for Druid/shaman to pick up some more healing ability, we still Love you.<P>Brotor Tiller<BR>54 Monk<BR>Rathe<BR>Buhd Insky<BR>52 Druid <BR>Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ugh, I wasn't going to post on this thread anymore, but there are a few things you obviously have no idea of. <P>First, I don't play a shaman or druid. I play a 59 wizard and a 51 monk. In fact, the majority of the people who support druids and shamans play other classes. You see, if they got better heals everyone would benefit from it, even clerics to some extent (well those I play with anyway, not your kind) since they wouldn't have to feel so bad about logging off in the middle of a raid. I consider myself lucky being in a large guild and we have snatched the majority of the high lvl clerics on our server. I know there are people in other guilds that have it much worse than I, but it’s the whole healing monopoly at higher lvls I am against.<P>Secondly, I seriously doubt you have reached lvl 40 yet. Suggesting that I can do a lot of dungeons without a cleric is a clueless thing to say. My idea of fun isn't hugging the zone line in karnor or sebilis. I have done the crypt and disco in seb without cleric/enchanter and it's possible, but it won't give you any exp and it's definitely not worth the risk.<P>Oh btw, I don’t remember insulting you in another thread, but if I did I am sure it was called for.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am a Cleric, currently lvl 54.  I take offense to some of the comments that all Clerics are whiner and so on and so forth.  I am all for Shaman/Druids getting an healing spell/fizzle rate lowered.  But here is my only problem with that....<P>1.  Many Druids I have grouped with don't want to even help heal.  I have seen them sit there and watch me die only to say, " I am not the healer" when asked why they just sat there.  (Yes, I am talking about post 50 Druids)  I am not saying all Druids are this way, that is silly, just saying it has happened more times than I can count.<P>2.  Everyone here has been comparing classes.  One to another.  My option is that you really can't.  It is like apples and oranges.  You can't compare classes to one another in the fashion you are.  The reason is, some players aren't comforable soloing and can't stand the down time, while others enjoy this form of exping.  It is all about how the person chooses to play the class, and how they feel comfortable and enjoy playing.  Sure you can compare some of the spells but it is still apples and oranges here.<P>I have both a Druid and a Cleric (main) post 50 and I understood the problems with each class when I started them.  (Granted this was before Kunark and the +50 allowance)<P>So I guess what I am trying to say is that I do agree Druids/Shamans should get a fizzle rate and/or Sup Heal lowered to 49.  But keep in mind the other issues that come with taking on more healing power....meaning bigger aggro (work on that AC) and less ablitily to perform your current group functions.  I assume you have already considered those things though or you wouldn't be asking.<P>I will finish with just one last comment.... I hear everyone complaining that there aren't enough Clerics to go around, which leaves many groups high and dry in some situations.  Well, that only begs the questions.  Why are there so few clerics?  and...  Is this a server issue or an global issue?<P>Just some thoughts,<BR>Dredyl Claymade - the NON-WHINING Cleric<BR>54 Vicar<P><BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't think that clerics understand that 90% of the time, druids/shamen/paladins are curing them (or maybe the enchanter).<P>As far as the "enchanter monopoly" goes, Bards and Necromancers can mesmerize.  No, they don't replace an enchanter, and no they shouldn't.  But if you have a couple necromancers, that will suffice.  It won't be efficient, but it will do.<P>For curing, 2 or even 3 druids/shamen/paladins does not do.  It isn't efficient AND it doesn't suffice.<P>Believe me, druids/shamen/paladins don't want to be curing.  If they wanted to cure, they would play clerics.  But, there are times when there isn't a choice and they have to.  In those cases, they want to be good enough to keep a tank alive in a high level dungeon (no, not on a zone raid or a dragon or whatever else, just for a regular 6 man experience group in, say, sebilis).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Man, dredyl, I must say that if a druid lets you die and doesn't even attempt to cure you, you need to put a black ball on him and just remove him from the group.  That is the wizard-druid that everyone hates.  You know, the one who doesn't thorn the tanks and never mems evac because he only has 8 slots and more than 8 nukes.<P>Tank: Hey, can I get a str buff?<BR>Druid: Do I look like a shaman?<BR>Tank: Can you thorn me?<BR>Druid: Bleh, thats a Magician's task.<BR>Cleric: I'm getting beat on, pass me a cure.<BR>Druid: You're the healer, heal yourself.<BR>Enchanter: I can't keep them all down, we are all gonna die, EVAC!<BR>Druid: Okay, Gating.<P>Yes, we hate them all.  Every single druid who nukes instead of cures is not playing a druid the way they are best played.  Druids are the utility class and need to be played as such.  Druids are not the best at anything (but maybe evaccing), so everything they can do should be something they DO do.  Nuke AND Cure AND Root AND Thorn AND blah blah blah.  If you don't do them all, then you aren't as valuable as one who does.<P>/end rant<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>End the Cleric healing monopoly already!<P>The post is accurate.  Druids/Shamans etc. are also healers.  What I am hearing from clerics is SELFISHNESS.  They want to be the ONLY viable healers post 50.  It's human nature.  It's understandable that you want to keep your position of advantage.  God knows Clerics KICKED AND SCREAMED AND WHINED to hell when they heard Paladins were getting an xp resurrection spell post 50.  They didn't consider that a high level pally doing res would off-load their burden.  And also since there just aren't enough clerics to go around it would be a GOOD thing to have another class to do that duty.<P>Now about this healing thing.  Druids and Shamans should get CH or a modified version thereoff.  Let's say a heal that restored 80% of the hp of target.  Would that be so bad?  Call it Improved Restoration and for the same mana cost as CH it would heal 80% of the target's max hp.  Hell Druids and Shamans have the same mana pool size as clerics the issue is that their mana is going to waste because they can't heal fast enough with a gimpy spell like Gheal (300 hp) against Juggernauts that double hit for 150.<P>Ok I'm ready for it.  Come flame me if you want clerics.  But remember what you say doesn't hurt me.  It WILL hurt YOU though when you (cleric)  go oom in a dungeon situation and the shammy in your group can't keep the warrior afloat fast enough to withstand that nasty juggernaut and your entire group goes splat!<P>-Peace-</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Kevinn, since you're new to this topic, and the fact that this is the 98th thread on it, here's what's been covered in the last 97 threads just like this one:<P>1. Clerics want Sup heal lowered and the fizzle fixed.<P>2. A lvl 60 paladin deserves that rez IMHO.<P>3. Clerics might even go for an improved heal spell for Shaman/druids.<P>4. THERE IS NO PERCENTAGE HEAL IN THE GAME.<P>5. Clerics aren't the enemey as much as some posters would like to believe. So stop using us as the evil step mother. The arguing and bickering occurs as a result of people pointing fingers, just like you did.<P>6. Why hasn't anyone asked for a Cel Healing like spell? It's a fast short term regen that I think would be the heal that shaman are looking for.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>This is a fun discussion to watch.  I picked up a few points and going to comment on them.<P>1 - Leveling a druid and shaman _IS_ easy.  I took my shaman to 25 with no powerleveling in no time while I was bored with my 31st cleric.  Druid I think is even easier.  Face it, they offer a lot to a group, and can solo.<P>2 - Clerics are CLERLY steps ahead of druids and shaman in terms of healing.   GOOD!  Like someone said, unless they disabled "cleric" at the login screen, go create a cleric.<P>The cleric "monopoly" is fine as it is thank you very much.  You druids and shaman are just whining becuase here is something else you are not the master of.  Clerics get frig all in "fun spells", cannot solo well (dont argue, any caster can take down a mob, but its how fast you kill, safe you kill, and how fast you recover for the next kill). <P>If you look upon yourselves as healers, go play one.  Like my "heal inc" message says for greater heal "Girlie Druid Heal Inc on %t".  You are baby healers, it takes a few of you to come close to a cleric.  Clerics are a diminishing population cause we see druids running around selling phat lewt they got.  Having fun.<P>So just bug off... really... I dont even care if other clerics disagree with me... maybe they want better backup healers, I dunno... I dont.  You have your strengths, and I have mine.  Perhaps the real issue is you need a few more friends to group with.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have a 51 druid group with 50+ clerics alot.  <P>After 39 druids and shamans simply can not heal tanks very well.  This has been posted many times.  I unlike some druids I know always have a heal memmed when I am in a group.  Why?  Becuase if the cleric is doing a CH on a tank and the enchanter is getting beat, the enchanter will die.  A greater heal to a robe wearer is still pretty good.  Plus it casts faster than a CH. <P>No one is asking that shamans or druids get any kind of rez just better healing.  I have seen tests of a 40% fizzel rate.  No spell should have fizzle rates like that.  At about level 40 a druid and shaman can heal almost as well as one cleric.  Post 50 not a chance.  Single mobs hitting for 150-200 pts each attack?  Then add the fact they are highly magic resistant.  And no we are not talking about uber mobs that you only meet on a high level raid.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, personally, I think its horrible that people cancel raids because they cant get enough clerics.<P>Have there ever been a raid cancelled for any other single class being absent? Peopple go to the planes without chanters, without warriors, without monks (not without wizards though, cause they get them there). But have you EVER seen anyone go on a multi-group raid without LOTS of clerics? NO!<P>Why? Becuase other healers can't cut the mustard - period. Other types of tanks can step in for warriors, there are other ways to deal with crowd control besides chanters (and people are getting better at it since chanters can't mez anything in Velious). People can pull other than monks. <P>But who can they sub for a cleric? NO ONE!<P>So you go on the three group raid and only two clerics show up? As a tank I PRAY that I get a cleric goup. Otherwise there will be alot of CR for me after the shaman's G-heal fizzled twice and when it finally cast I was dead.<P>Clerics don't fret. You will never lose your MASTR HEALER status. But why do you fear other healers having a mildly improved healing ability post 50?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

They are too hard to play and, now, whatever class xp bonus they used to have is gone.  <P>The one thing a cleric has going for him is the ability to get groups, because his premier ability to heal is unquestioned.

</FONT><HR>Posted this to another thread and I'll post it here as well....<P>Ok, I'm goning to say this again so the thread will stay at the top and maybe Absor or someone will tell you once and for all that you ARE NOT GOING TO GET ANY HEALING UPGRADES THAT THREATEN THE PRIMARY ABILITIES OF THE CLERIC.<BR>Yes, I will admit it, we clerics dominate the high level healing areana. And what you thick skulls don't seem to comprehend is that we pay for this by having little to nothing in the way of secondary abilities.<P>Now let's look at a cleric's secondary abilities in a 50+ game. <P>Stun: Fun to cast and useful on some mobs but not nearly as efficient as a slow from a chanter or shaman for damage reduction. Only for situations where you HAVE to keep that caster stunned (VS). <P>Our DD's(pointed out time and again) look good if you only look at the max potential of the blast. They are NOT mana efficient for the lvl clerics get them at, they are MR based which is usually the mob's best save and they are slooooooow. Both to cast and recycle time. <P>Undead DD's? Nice spells, find high lvl undead where you could pull one at a time without getting run over by a giant or froglok and I'll be your friend for life.<P>Our buffs and rezzes tie in with our mastery of HP management and healing power and is part of our primary skills.<P>Bottom line, druids and shamans are casters that can heal as part of a larger package. THEY ARE NOT HEALERS!!!!!!!!!! Verant never intended them to be and will never change it so that they are. Or if they did, that would be the ONLY thing in this game that would make me retire my cleric forever. Because if a group can get the primary healing power from a druid or shaman then there is no reason for them to look twice at a cleric, there just isn't enough for a cleric to offer to counter that kind of versitility and power.<P>Radcliffe Steelhammer<BR>Dwarven Cleric of the Pathfinders<BR>Cazic Thule<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Clerics saying they pay a price to heal.  Get a grip.  You can't do all the "fun" things because all you do is heal.  Too bad, you could probably have a good time root parking, stunning, DD'ing, Etc if you had a good back-up healer in your group.  So.. until then med, heal, med, heal, repeat and enjoy.<P>Reasonable Clerics (IE. Actually high level Clerics that know what this means for everyone playability).  Thank you for seeing a problem and discussing a need for a druid/shaman upgrade.  Its talks with you folks that allow us to figure out how to fix a situation without infringing on your primary ability.<P>Enough of the soloing argument.  Anyone knows that the 55+ game is not about soloing for ~any~ class.  What happens when you hit 60?  You have a great soloer?  What good does that do you?  When I read the description about the Druid class I figured it was like the D&D Druid.  No where in the manual did it say, “You shall solo well and be pretty much worthless to a group or a raid.”  I would have made a different choice.<P>Someone mentioning that leveling their Druid was easier than a Cleric and thus the price "you pay".  My Enchanter (A needed class.. easy to get grouped later on but harder earlier on -- Sound familiar Clerics?) 20 Days... level 52 with no power leveling.  So, what’s your point?<P>If nothing gets changed, don't be shocked when you see a high level Druid with a low level Cleric standing behind him being power leveled.  Odds are, it’s a frustrated Druid that is tired of getting the shaft.<P>Once again, I apologize to those reasonable folks out there.  I guess I am tired of the same old "I want to protect my insta-group abilities regardless of you or other players needs".</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The whole premise behind a magic based system is that the more benefit conferred by a spell, the more mana it should cost to cast that spell.<P>As such, the mana cost for casting a CH should be proportional to the amount of HP's ultimately being restored. In other words, it should take more mana to completely heal a lvl 60 tank versus a lvl 50 tank (or equivalent hybrid). <P>My proposal is to make CH so that it is a variable mana cost spell. The program checks the total hp of the intended target and this then determines how much mana would be consumed by casting CH on that target.<P>The spell would accomplish what it was meant for: providing a "complete" heal.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok.  i've avoided this but now i'm going to put in my 2 bits.<P>I have a lvl 51 cleric with the following spells i memorize for healing at this time.<P>Remedy - A fast casting spell that has less healing ability than superior heal but is nice to cast on spell casters since they go down fast.  I think it's a nice upgrade to greater heal.<P>Superior Heal - We all know this one and yes the druids and Shamans have the SAME thing.<P>Complete Heal - Used sparingly depending on the class that it's casted on.  It takes 10 seconds to cast and to be efficient we tend to wait til your at half health or two bubbles to cast it.  We can't do that with rangers because after 10 seconds your normally toast by then.  For spell casters, this spell we would never cast because superior heal normally heals you completely up or almost completely due to low hitpoints that you have and it takes to long to cast.<P>What spell would you shamans and Druids like to have to replace the spells that are currently available to a cleric post 50?  If you get any spell that's superior to superior heal it would be much better heal spell than what i have currently being a cleric other than complete heal that i don't use all the time anyways.<P>Now also keep in mind, All my top heal spells are extremely mana intensive.  I don't have any mana regeneration increase unlike shamans.  So if shamans have better healing than a post 50 cleric and can get mana faster than a cleric.  Who would you want in a group?  I don't want to hear this garbage that we have mana regeneration called, bards and enchanters either.  If you can assure me that they will be online 24 hours a day, 7 days a week whenever i'm online and group with me all the time then sure i got mana regeneration.  But it's rare i see a enchanter or bard in a group.<P>If anyone has any idea's on a heal spell that's better than superior heal spell which is my main stay heal spell most of the time and still want a cleric to be a healer let me know.<P>But i will say one thing flatly, each class has it's own status in a group.  Clerics are the healers, shamans are the buffers and debuffers.  Druids can do basically anything else because they have the capability to do anything but masters of nothing.  If a shaman or druid wanted to be a healer, they should have made a cleric instead of a Shaman or druid.<P>On the point of soloing, I'm sorry but to all the people who say that clerics have great DD spells and we can solo all we want.  I suggest you get a timer out and time how long it takes to cast them DD spells and how much our mana bar drops each time we blast.  Our DD spells are the most inefficent spells i've ever seen.  I've wiped out all my mana and still see a monster standing.  Also add into this, all the mana i'm wasting rooting the monster to stand back and blast too.  So unless you have tried soloing as a actual cleric and not guess as to what we can do, don't say a word.  You don't know squat.<P>Ixcor Blackthorne<BR>Lvl 53 Pathfinder<P>Ixcorian D'eltaire<BR>Lvl 51 Vicar<P>Ixcutus<BR>Lvl 18 Wizard<P>Forgotten Alliance Guild<BR>Bertox Server<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First off, to directly reply to one rather interesting flaw here...<BR>Freewynd:<BR>You said...<BR>"Reasonable Clerics (IE. Actually high level Clerics that know what this means for everyone playability). Thank you for seeing a problem and discussing a need for a druid/shaman upgrade. Its talks with you folks that allow us to figure out how to fix a situation without infringing on your primary ability."<P>Well... Someone says that cleric's are biased and shouldn't argue against, and yet a post like this comes through. Right. Everyone who disagrees with you is not "reasonable" and anyone who agrees with them is? No no no. A lot of people (Cleric's and other classes as well.) have made perfectly valid points against your arguement, (not to say that there aren't valid points on both sides of the fence..) and they have been perfectly "reasonable" when stating these points.<BR>So why is anyone who doesn't agree with you unreasonable again? Perhaps because you are too jaded in your own blind faith in one side of the arguement to realize that others have "reasonable" points as well?<BR>*walks away wondering what the world of Norrath is coming to.*<P>Secondly, on the point of the topic here..<BR>Yeah, you all have a valid point.. I would agree with fizzle rates being lowered, although that would in turn have to come into effect on all of the post 50 spells work that way. But sure, it sounds reasonable. You guys want a celestial healing type spell?<BR>Well hell, in that case, I could use Chloro, or just perhaps a beefed up version of Regen, cause I don't really wanna step in on your territory on that one.. No worries. Just give it to us at 52 or so, so that it's obsolete if there is a druid or shammy in the group...<BR>Also, RE Freewynd's post..<BR>"Clerics saying they pay a price to heal. Get a grip. You can't do all the "fun" things because all you do is heal. Too bad, you could probably have a good time root parking, stunning, DD'ing, Etc if you had a good back-up healer in your group. So.. until then med, heal, med, heal, repeat and enjoy."<BR>Well. That's just plain reasonable right there.<BR>If you guys did get all that you were asking for, and I was in a group with a druid, and actually stood up and did all that stuff to a mob... I'd be blacklisted for life. Hmm let's see.. Mana eating DD.. Stuns that are highly resistable.. Root which will wear off eventually and get me beat on, causing the druid/shaman to use more mana.. And what's this "etc" thing your refer to? Sorry, you're confusing us with cleric's and shaman's. We don't have anything else we can do during battle, except maybe screw with a druid's evac and hit DA. *grin*<BR>So my two cents..<BR>Yeah, improve fizzle rates.. But do it across the board. You can not have imbalances like that, it's not practical.<BR>A Celestial Healing type spell? Sure, but give me my regen first. Fair trade off, I think just about anyone would agree, but one that neither side probably wants to do.<BR>SHeal at 49? Very unreasonable, IMO. The levels at which spells are recieved have a lot of thought put into it, and will take a major screw up to change on VI's part, obviously. That one is a little too far.<BR>Any other idea's have been obscene, more or less. (IE 80% heal..)<BR>Pallies with the exp rez didn't bug me much.. Not many people would take their rez at level 54+ anyway.. But, mistakes happen, and it's good to have that to fall back on in case you accidently jump into Vox's lair whilst meandering through perma, and you don't really want a cleric to share in the stupidity of the situation.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Pay off a necro and then rez yourself.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>The reasons why cleric's have insta-group capabilities (which is exagerated, of course) is not due to the ineffectiveness of druid's/shaman's, but is due to the fact that there are way too many druid's (shaman's to a lesser extendt) for every one cleric. No one can argue that, unless it is VASTLY different on other servers. But this seems to be a pretty global discussion anyway. So, you wouldn't NEED to be able to heal and hold a healing role in a group, if there weren't so damned many of you, and so damned few of us. *grin* No one's fault on this one, just fate. If there was one cleric per warrior in every appropriate level range, well, the world would be a much happier place, and you'd see warrior's getting their insta-groups, instead of cleric's. It's not the case, deal with it.<P>Bottom line -- No, druid's and shaman's aren't meant to be healers. They can not hold together a group post 50, and it was designed that way. The higher you go in levels, the more precise your role in a group becomes, for the most part. I believe it was said earlier, and it was the perfect statement. Druid's are the jack of all trades, but masters of none. I know you don't want to be master healers. But you've got a lot of ground on it as it is, just like you do with nuking, buffing, etc. You're no wizard, nor shaman, nor cleric. You do a LITTLE of all three. You should not be able to hold a group together healing, or it would render your other abilities useless when a cleric is not present. Shaman's, you have a very precise role as it is now, which, is probably by far the most underestimated skill at lower levels. You have a buff for everything. (Group charisma? Yeah.. my 45 cha does kinda need a boost.. heh. ) I used to find it amusing when my screen would be covered in buffs, before realizing just how useful most of them are, and how great it is to have you guys around. Don't tell me that your group would prefer to give up those buffs and have you heal instead, cause they don't want to wait for a cleric.<P>Guys.. 50+, pick up groups are harder and harder to come by. You should.. No, you probably, not should, have a good solid group of friends, or aquaintences with whom you associate regularly, play with, group with, generally have fun with. There is probably a cleric or two or five in this group of friends, so nine times out of ten, you really don't need a druid or shammy to play healer. When you do, you're losing their "expertise skill" in exchange for their not so great skill. Not a good trade off in a group, since you all agree that you don't want to rival a cleric, you just want a little something more to hold a group together.<BR>/shrug<BR>My two coppers..<BR>/em waits for all the dr00ids to tell him they aren't as biased as he is...<P>Darwinain Seafarer<BR>Cleric of Gyn Cadley Reejeryn<BR>Lanys T'Vyl<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047656-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047656.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047656-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047656-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047656-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047656-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=047656&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=047656&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
