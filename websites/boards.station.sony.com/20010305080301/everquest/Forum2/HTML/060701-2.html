</FONT><HR>The easiest solution to stop cross-teaming is by stopping the communication of the light and dark teams. For example, darks can't send tell to lights, and lights cant send tells to darks.<P>If this were to happen, it would probably be best to allow players who don't like it to change servers (since some people may have real life friends who play the oposing team).<P>If you think about it though, this is a quick and easy fix to cross-teaming.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I cant speak for Rallos or Vallon, but I certainly can for Tallon<P>First things first, most of the people supporting this from Tallon if not all of them will gain a significant amount of power.<P>Tallon Zek was shown somthing its 2nd week up, Darkies (DE's Ogres Trolls) were made up of the superior gamers.  The 2nd week of TZ Freeport was seiged by a ragtag army in raw-hide and rusty weapons.  By the end of the first month MoZ was arguably the most powerful force on TZ, a dark guild.  Tunare's Wardancers although they didnt invite anyone else then elves was the first guild to promote Xteaming in order to fight WoZ in the freeport area.  OK history lesson of TZ's first days over.  Now to the real matters at hand.<P>IF you hardcode the teams the following guilds on TZ will be broken up, if not destroyed:<BR>Alliance of the Light<BR>Windwalkers<BR>Stature of the Gods<BR>Aggressors<BR>The Knights Eternal<BR>The Highland Army<BR>Pandemonium<BR>Knights of the White Rose<BR>White Dragons<BR>Dragon's Light<BR>Archaic Arbitrators<BR>Avenging Order<BR>Tunare's Wardancers<P>There is only one guild in the 'Light Alliance' on TZ that is one team and considered to be a powerhouse, Final Endevor.  FE members have posted on this thread I've noticed... Coraan is nothing more then TZ's village idiot and Ellaar's motives I wonder about.<P>People like Melara have been asking for this their entire time on TZ, people from FE only ask for it now since Pandemonium (PDM) became a guild.  Little more server history... Patryns xteamed one night as a joke, Finality (now FE) lead a crusade against Patryns... this little war lead to the creation of PDM.  PDM is basically the only high lvl PvP guild on TZ server, they go around looking for fights and they get them.  PDM is also the most feared guild on TZ server for various reasons.  Oddly enough they war cry of people like Coraan has only started after the fact of PDM's being formed and staying around.<P>The fact remains that the minority will often speak out the most, hence players of the 30% who wish for hard code teams will ask for it the most... that other 70% are the people who enjoy the server and are too busy playing to comment on this.<P>If Verant wishes to seriously make changes to the PvP servers to such drastic extremes then they need to consult the players, and a message board thread is NOT the way to go.<P>Theres a little room in Qeynos Sewers where GM's can port people in and out of, right? On TZ there are the 'bighitters' or the well known people.  Everyone on TZ knows who Gunzo is, or who Darkoan is, or Azuur is for that matter. Why not have the GM's and the most influential players of the servers meet and discuss the matters in a controlled way? let every faction of gamers have their say and present arguments WHY their proposed changes should take place.  That method might require alot of planning but will lead to the best solution on any given server.<P>Ziguld<BR>Tanking Pathfinder of SotG on TZ</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi decayed<P>Thanks for presenting more arguments on your concern.<P>I still think you are exaggerating your inability to find someone to PK within 8 levels. Further, that alone does not justify the following scenario:<P>Casters can't land any dd/bolt spell on a player or mob over 6 levels higher than them. This is a hardcoded fact.  But they can be attacked by a player 8 levels higher than them.  <P>Further, Wizards in particular have *no* offensive capabilities outside of their spells (ie no pets, no melee ability, no damage shields, no dots). If they can't fight back in any way at all, they should not be able to be attacked by PKers, either.  <P>Can you see there is some problem here? You are the only one defending the 8 level cap, so feel free to keep going.<P>8 lvls = INSANE difference in power<P>4 lvls = BIG difference in power <P>I just think that a person should have SOME chance of defending themselves, and therefore 8 levels is just too much of a difference. At the least, can we agree that 6 levels (within the spell cap limit is workable)?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Dont hard code the teams like they are now (short, elf, human, dark) that means basically 1/3 of the people are going to quit (namely all the elves and shorts - they get 'shafted' in PvE and PvP). Be aware that only 5% of the players who just post a lot want hardcoded teams. Doing this would basically destroy all the current light guilds and friendhips and make the servers human vs dark.<P>Basically if you made a new GvE server with hardcoded good and evil teams and a movelog you would have 3 empty servers and one really overpopulated server.<P>The solution is imho this:<P>Make Tallon hard coded Good vs Evil teams, and maybe add a dark elf bard class (track and other bard stuff thats needed for PvE). Remove faction hits (they might have worked pre-kunark but now they are just annoying).<P>Make Vallon a free for all server like Rallos but coin only (and no faction hits of course) where the hardcore oneteamers and the crossteamers can play.<P>Open a movelog between the three.<P>Dont make the 8 level difference smaller, a lower level difference will only make OOr healing worse, it is fine on the coin servers. What should be changed is the resist penalty for casting on higher level players. Make it so your spells land with resists like if the other player would have been even con (if he is higher or even) or lower!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>From part 1:<P>&lt;&lt; 7) Players should face some kind of consequences from the NPCs in the world due to PKing. My idea is that if a person attacks you first, then you can kill them with no penalty. If you kill someone unprovoked, then you take a faction hit if they are on the same alignment as you. If you kill the same person 3 times in a certain time limit UNPROVOKED, then you are flagged as a murderer for a certain time limit, and are KOS to NPCs aligned with the victim.<BR>&gt;&gt;<P>Excellent idea - but people who come to the aid of the victim of an attack should likewise be free of faction hits.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Do not change the 8 level limit. The 8 level limit exists on the team server to allow for TEAM PvP.  Some people already complain about Out of Range healers/buffers.  To decrease the PvP level range is to increase this problem to the point that the only players that you can group with for PvP are those at your same level.<P>There, DrFate, is your argument for, the 8 level PvP range.  I can elaborate on it if, necessary.<P>I, actually think it should start lower and increase beyond 8 levels as the player level increases, as was mentioned previously by, another poster.  If, it is to remain static then, leave it at 8.<P>Akrons,  the only real problem that I have with your position on item loot is the lack of risk that the casting classes have.  If' spells within spellbooks were lootable then, I would say, yes, let all equipment slots be lootable.  If, spells or spellbooks are to remain immune from looting then, I say, no, let all equipped gear be unlootable but, let inventory slots, including empty containers and the contents within containers be, lootable.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

(I know, it doesn't happen often but it DOES happen) Not all do, but if its the PvP all of you love so much (I know I do, when I actually get a chance to fight back).. Allow players to hang on to their gear and fight back. Maybe that lone paladin might turn to face you instead of turning to flee and THEN you'd see some real battles being fought.<P>Implementing more GM's and guides is a good idea for every server but it won't help that one person that got exploited that one time and lost that thick banded belt, GEB's, or whatever due to an exploit. <BR>Even "fixing" the current exploits will undoubtably lead to new ones being discovered.. <P>I've played on rallos for over a year and a half.

</FONT><HR>I personally believe that people who oppose hard coding teams are the ones who gain the spoils of the exploits they create. Your explanation of the "30% are the loudest, 70% majority like it as it stands" is BS. Get your other 70% out here and post on this to prove me wrong and bump this thread to 1700 replies instead of 500. If you go back and read all 500 posts and count the number of individual screen names in favor of it vs, opposed you'll be forced to silence your Bs arguement for you are vastly outnumbered. That is why a company like the one making DAoC is willing to invest millions in making a hard coded Team PVP game is becuse our numbers truely do outnumber yours.<P>Again I'll state, Vallon/Tallon have been "Teams" servers from day one, not hard coded unfortunately. But Dark Age of Camelot is a hard coded PVP teams game coming out. Are you exploiting/xteaming people going to play this game? And if so, will you be the first to whine about being killed by another team just because you don't wanna hurt anyone? Who cares if its a team server right, its your right to play how you want because you pay money. Wrong answer, thankfully DAoC has made it so you can't speak or hear the other team talk, so I won't have to listen to you whine after I kill you 30 times over for coming into my realm alone blabbering about alliances and free love for all.<P>My 2 cents</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Why so many parts instead of just 1 big thread?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Anyway without copy and pasting what I said before, I still think the best way is to have 1 server be hard-coded 4 teams, and the other be 2 hard-coded good vs evil teams, and then allow the players to move to either one when the change happens.<P>Divide the deities in half, make half good (Order)and half evil (Chaos) (I don't think having a 3rd neutral team would be a good idea, then it won't be much different than it is now)<P>Here's my guess as to how you can divide the dieties up... Make evil deities be: Bertox, Cazic, Innoruul, Rallos Zek, Solsek Ro, Veeshan, maybe Bristtlebane, and the rest be good. This will give most races the choice to be either. Agnostic folks can have it determined by their race, an agnostic DE would be evil, agnostic high elf would be good. I think something like this would be good and a lot of fun to play, and would also give the deity you choose actually have something to do with how you play, instead of just a faction modifier for NPCs</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>i already stated my pvp concern on part two thread, but i guess i'll go over what that was and add a few other things.<P>i play on tallon zek, which is a pvp teams server.<P>so, my major concern is cross-teaming and the exploits that it brings.  solutions that come to mind are: <P>1.making the teams by guilds, and allowing pvp only between one guild and another (cant attack a guildmate, but can attack anyone else)<P>2.making the teams be aligned by deity.  good/neutral gods vs the evil gods.  then hard code the game so that one team cannot group/heal/buff the other team.<BR>---<P>with either of these solutions implememted, faction hits become a problem.  the concept of faction hits is a pretty good one, however with the disgustingly involved and time consuming effort it takes to once again not be KOS in your home town, i suggest removing the hits. the way things are on rallos, with the guards attacking pvpers, would suit well enough.<P>and speaking of guards- uber npc guards really have no use on pvp servers other than to prevent city raids.  one of the most fun events on pvp servers is to go into an enemy city and proceed to attack everything npc and pc's alike.  the uber guards prevent this from happening.  there is simply no fun in runing into certain exp loss.<P>damage dealt-  the way damage is dealt is fine how it is.  there are no spells that kill in one shot.  none.  resist gear and dispells are more than enough to help a player survive those nasty dd and dots. any nerfs what-so-ever to the amount of spell damage dealt would simply overpower melee classes.<P>thats all i can think of at the moment.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

This levels the playing field with the naked gankers.<P>3.Line of Site should be implemented for Casters.  Lets face it, melees have to see you, why not make them have to see us?<P>4.Zone, bind, corpse, druid/wizard ring and bank camping is out of control.<P>5.AE spells… nuff said! <P>6.Fix Fear and Charm (but only if they make the server Coin only due to huge exploits)<P>7.Make certain zones non-PvP.  Example: LAINS’S.  Nothing good happens when people try and take over a group that is doing a plain’s run.  MASS exp loss, which hurts the casual gamer again.<P>8.No PvP till level 10.<P>9.Raise the PvP to a 6 level difference (only if the server is Coin Only)<P>10.Last but not least…. COIN ONLY.

</FONT><HR>&lt;&lt; 1 IMMORTAL HEALING EXPLOITS: This is where someone of your team heals your opponent. You cannot prevent this because they are on the same team as you. Guilds and groups of mulitple teams use this exploit all the time to drive people out of dungeons, that they would otherwise not be able to defeat in "fair" PvP combat. I have seen inferior forces destroy much more powerful groups many times because they were using this exploit. This kind of skewed PvP is no fun. Verent really should fix this. <P>An almost perfect solution would be to make it so that for a short period after taking damage from or being cast upon by another player you cannot be the recipiant of any beneficial spells from anyone on an opposing team. This fix would still allow for cross-team grouping and guilds, but would prevent people from using it to gain an unfair PvP advantage<BR>&gt;&gt;<P>This unnnecessarily destroys the ability of guild members to aid each other in PvP. It also allows a more serious PvE exploit - if a group of members of different light teams is fighting a tough NPC, an exploiter can run up and hit all members whose race differs from the healer, preventing their healing, and resulting in likely XP death for all members of the group.<P>A far better fix would be to remove invulnerability from the healer. I.e. if you heal or buff a member of another team, you are vulnerable for a short time to members of your own team. This is not open to exploitation, and still allows all members of light guilds to assist their guildmates.<P>I would suggest a further modification, to prevent a single-team exploit - if you attack a member of a group, you become vulnerable to all the other group members of you own race. This would prevent single-team guild from ganging up on one opponent while his friends have to stand helplessly by and watch him die.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Thieves hiding shouldn't be visible to people with see invis, there should be a specific see hidden skill for thieves and bards and a few other classes.<P>Magic resistances should be scaled to PvP proportions or level should have a greater effect than resistance scores. In fact, EVERYTHING PvP should be scaled to be appropriate to player totals where possible.<P>You need to look at balance of classes and stop PvP usage of unbalancing things (like you did with fear and charm). My personal suggestion list would include fixing blind to leave the chat window up, giving melee's some kind of "face target" skill, adding a specific "remove bad buff" spell to some classes, making shadow step easier to interrupt.<P>Item loot is right out due to the no-loot bags naked caster thing IMHO. Coin loot is OK because coin doesn't take forever to get back. Faction hits for team servers need to be applied fairly (to all who hit the target, heal the attackers, et.al.) especially to DOT deaths which don't give faction at all right now, giving SKs and necros an unfair combat advantage. Cross treaming needs to be addressed somehow, I personally like the "heal other team, killable by same team for 10 minutes" thing.<P>Nuff said.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

While being an "afterthought" to EQ is what PvP servers ARE, that does not make it right. It does not mean that this is the way it always SHOULD be. You must try to address that first. Make it mainstream, treat it as such, and then work on solutions. Don't pretend to care and offer empty promises and half-a$$ed solutions. Either tell pvp servers that they are to be smurfed (made blue) and not bother with them, or get a true workforce behind it and make good on upgrades, balances, bug issues and of course customer service.<P>Also, thanks for the HT nerf on SK's. Really helps. Get a few kids doing it and you gotta go and mess up ALL sk's. Using that rational, don't you think then that PVP servers (being the less populated minority) would be heard OVER the blue servers and catered to morso??

</FONT><HR>I have been around since the early days of Tallon Zek, and have always loved the server.there have, however, been a few changes that i disagree with.<P>One of the greatest things about the PvP servers are the risk. I can understand that some people want something of a safety net while at the same time playing on a PvP server. I feel that Item loot was a great part of the PvP experience. Playing a warrior, I came to terms with the fact that casters can be naked, or the possibility that you may get ambushed. Many don't seem to understand that a naked caster is at a distinct disadvantage, and not as big of a threat as some would have them believe. Maybe make a new teams server with Item loot... I am sure some would want to transfer those characters, but alot of people wouldn't mind starting over from scratch on a new server.<P>If there was to be a new server, I also feel the level cap should be upped... this is a sensitive issue though, as there are many players that feel as though they stand no chance against someone just because that person is higher. If it were possible to make some sort of progressing level range, so the lower level players don't get so discouraged, would add a great new element to the game. High level wars and true guild unity would be some desired results of this.<P>As it is now, people complain constantly about cross-teaming... though i would never do it myself, it doesn't bother me all that much (I figure, the more enemies, the better). To fix the problem doesn't have to be something nearly as complicated as locking teams, or adding in checks. All that has to be done is remove the faction hit. Some would argue that the faction hit makes for more realistic roleplay. I am under the impression though, that with the faction hit in place, many times a player will opt to not fight someone that they would under normal circumstances. This applies in extreme to the "light" races, where they want to be able to interact with the NPCs in a city dominated by the other players' race. You have to sacrafice a little bit of the Roleplaying to get a lot back.<P>On the issue of fear and charm... these are special abilities of some classes, and i feel should be allowed. I can see many accidents and hard feelings with fear, and understand the reasons for its removal. Charm, on the other hand, was a great part of the early days on Tallon Zek. Some, naturally, would use it to intentionally make others lose experience... but that is a risk I, for one, am willing to take. I do not see it as being too much different than someone charming a monster, bringing it to where you are rooted, then gating. Things like this will happen, but are definatley acceptable. Many of my friends and I play on a PvP server not to gain exp (or whine at the loss), but to participate in PvP, as we find it to be the most thrilling aspect of the game.<P>I am glad to see that Verant hs decided to look in to PvP again, as it has been a long time with many changes to the game since last it was tweaked. I will be eagerly awaiting the outcome of this discussion, thank you for listening.<P>Jietz ShadowEyes<BR>Warlord of the Ebon Army</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Woot Absor about time you got to us.<P>Id just like to say i think the X teaming sucks. i hate coming upon someone Im aboutto kill in one shot or so and all of the sudden see another Dark Elf like myself healing/buffing them. That sucks. Plain and simple. Worse than a mob coming by healing another mob, because you cant mez/stun it or anything. I suggest this: make it so that there are the standard 4 race teams as it is right now. But add in a 5th team. This 5th team would be comprised of everyone who healed/buffed a member of an opposite team. Thusly, a DE cleric come upon a human he considers a friend, whos fighting another DE. The cleric heals the human, and his name turns from team color orange to another as of yet undefined color. Hes on the 5th team, and can now be hit by ANYONE on ANY team who is within range to do so, and vice versa. That would no only fix a lot of problems in PVP but let us know who the traitors truly are. A lot of lights and darks are hardcore team only oriented and this would be a good improvement I feel. Also a change from 8 level range to 6 would help a little in balancing the PVP, and maybe change the conning system for pvp so Green is out of range, and we are not constanly unsure if we can hit someone whosblue/red. thanks Absor</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There is just too much for me to go over right now so at the risk of repeating others here goes:<P>1. Percentage chance to Loot!!!!!!! ************ <P>-Rather than loot an item everytime lets make it a percent, like 10-20%. Items mean too much in EQ for tanks and such, take too long to get, and yet a naked caster can remove one in an instant. By reducing the chance to loot their rewards for this behaviour are MUCH lower. Don't make Rallos go coin-only, this is a better option that can appease both side of this issue.<P>2. Delevelling!<P>-Fix this please. Its a huge problem on Rallos and very frustrating.<P>3. Anyone in range should con white!<P>-Makes things alot more interesting and helps to stop a bit of bullying by red cons on blues.<P>4. No major changes please! <P>-You risk creating a whole slew of other problems. I think a percentage loot would be a huge change for the better on Rallos without causing many side effects.<P>5. New PVP server  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>-Doubt this will happen but one where the rules and such are down from the beginning. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My simple change requests:<P>Con PvP should be red/white/green<P>white = in range<P>This would add uncertainty to the player battles. This is needed because so many of the fights are just one sided slaughters. <P>Additionally, change PvP so you must do more than 50% of the damage to a player in orfer to be able to loot him. This would cut down on players ganking others who are weak after a battle. It would also prevent ninja-looting.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060701-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060701.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060701-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060701-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060701-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060701-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060701-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=060701&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=060701&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
