</FONT><HR>You people amaze me about as much as verant does by putting so much effort into a slowly dying dinosaur.<P>By this time Verant should be halfway through making EQ2, not applying bandaids and duck tape to this one.<P>Everquest is old. Its getting older by the day, and its ability to present a compelling enough world to keep drawing people in is shrinking with every day any other game is in development.<P>Its all good and well that Verant believes that their next big thing is Star Wars, but its basically going to split their customer base in half. Not everyone enjoys science fiction, and I would wager alot more find a fantasy setting interesting.<P>So where will you go when there is Star Wars and no EQ2? You will go to UO2 or anything else that rears its head.<P>And for everyone that says "Oh I hate Origin, I would never go to anything they have." I have to say LOL.<P>Because you will go there because its new in a real way. Because it does something different that you haven't experienced before, and its not old. You people aren't craving the rehashed, re-fried content that Verant spits out.<P>You want something different. You fantasy goers can sit back and say you will be content with new floor plans and and retextured monsters in the same static world all you want to. We both know the real truth.<P>Do you really want to be here for the 6th expansion pack, "Ruins of the Gnome King's Toilet" ?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Scout:<P>My point is that I *don't HAVE* any issues.  Even if I did, I wouldn't post the kind of sniveling tripe I see here and in other class-whines.<P>Yes, I do post gripes and complaints here.  NO, they are not class-envy whines.  I comment on specific bugs (note, "bugs," and not class inadequacies that have been stated to have been by design).  I comment on broad general issues.  I comment on specific aspects of game mechanics.  What I *don't* do, on the other hand, is complain that the class I've CHOSEN to pursue is worse than any others.  I've seen too many BAD things come of Verant responding to class envy posts.<P>Any time someone compares class A to class B C or D, it's a class envy whine.  There are many class envy whines cleverly disguised by the fact that they don't explicitly mention another class as a basis of comparison.  It doesn't change the fact that the post is started by someone that is merely upset that the grass is greener on the other side of the fence, without realizing that everyone's lawn is more or less parched and brown.<P>It doesn't matter if SunMoon is a spokesperson for the ranger community, because it simply means that rangers are STILL part of a COMMUNITY composed of many other individuals, who ALL have issues, and NO ONE is more important than anyone else, regardless of how many of you band together for a sob-fest with a quart of Haagen-Dazs in your jammies.  You're a bunch of self-absorbed babies that will cry until someone pays attention to you, and when they do, you'll cry some more, because you won't quite get what you'd hoped for.  Too bad Verant's response is already conditioned reflex, and sooner or later they'll cave, just to shut you people up, and ruin yet another facet of the game.<P>I swear, the downfall of the game will be "the huddled masses" syndrome... People will continue this trend of "if we complain loud and long enough, no matter what our issue, Verant will appease us," and the game will become blander than oatmeal.  I hope they hold out long enough for another game to capture my interest and earn my dollars.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I dont know why some people insist on passing an argument about the problems of a class as a class envy whine. Thats just the thoughtless way of arguing. You dont argue a counter-point, you just blow it off as untrue without any evidence to support you.<P>Class evny? How does that even make sense? I dont even see how class envy could really exist in EQ. What is there to make someone envious? Maybe if someone started demanding rangers get all the spells druids have and all the abilities and armor warriors can wear, then maybe it would have something to do with envy. But obviously, no one in their right mind is asking for that.<P>What people are asking for makes absolute sense.  Even players of other classes feel rangers are imbalanced. What envy are they feeling?<P>I agree that there's a danger in getting Verant to change every little thing people aren't satisfied with. Things cant work that way. Thats why the US government has elected officials; the responsibility is on them to decide whats best for us and the country without ever pandering to the desires of every single citizen. But when there are obvious problems its also the responsibility of the government to step in and do something about it.<P>As for how Verant is responding to the work being done for rangers, I'm more or less satisfied with how they've responded on this thread.<P>The Scars of Velious is the most important thing they have going now. And it should be, I wouldn't expect it to be otherwise. No one else should either. They have a business to run, people cant expect them to respond to every little thing and fix every little thing, especially not until SoV is released.<P>I'm impressed that even with the ongoing development of SoV they're still doing regular updates to EQ. I'm sure they've got a team of people working on those updates. And there probably is someone charged with the responsibility of investigating rangers.<P>I'm impressed that they actually were in contact with Sunmoon. That should indicate to everyone that they are interested in how the game works in regard with the players themselves. The fact that a reply hasn't been sent in a month shouldn't be a big deal. I'm sure they're busy. I've been busy enough at work that I haven't responded to people in a few weeks. And you can bet they aren't getting only 5-10 emails a day, they probably have 50+ emails sitting in their mailbox every morning. Lets see you wade through all that to pick out important emails.<P>If you've got time to reply to emails then you're probably not getting work done. I know this from personal experience.<P>Everything seems so simple on our end. But we have to keep in mind that we're not going to get everything we want, and especially not any time soon. Its the way of the world.<P>Verant is a business, and if they want to be successful they've got to manage themselves like a business.<P>I'm hoping rangers get some of their problems resolved, but I'm not going to beat myself over it...<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>And I think the most important thing is to ALWAYS be polite and logical. That goes a long way, and it adds to your argument. It always sounds like a class whine when someone talks about how frustrated they are.<P>The moment you add a swear, whether its edited out or not, or you start attacking someone in one form or another your argument is rendered invalid. And it pretty much guarantees that the people at Verant are going to ignore it.<P>I think good subject titles are an important part of this. I tend to avoid threads with titles something like; "Rangers are BROKEN, why does Verant lie to us!"<P>Most posts in these threads seem to degrade into the same sort of ranting.<P>I felt the need to mention this because of the number of ranger posts out there that involve ranting and nagging. Yeah, they're probably right, but they're not arguing the point correctly. Thats one reason so many of these threads dont get official responses.<P>Yeah, you're probably pissed off, but you've got to keep a cool head about it, no matter how many times you've been given the run around.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Wow, in all my years of EQ, never have I been so perplexed in terms of "which side of the fence to stand on".<P>Having played on test server since EQ's release (I recently left test server after the item wipe), I have had the opportunity to test many things and work very closely with people from Verant.  Smedley has called my house, I've traded emails with GZ and Brad, and I've debated many scenarios here on the boards.... usually in favor of Verant's position.  Due to this, I've been labled a troll, a Verant Ass-Kisser, etc.  However, my arguments speak loudly, and I'm very unbiased.<P>I've had direct influence on the changes to the wizard class (it is still lacking a bit, but at this point, I dont know what to add without making it too powerful).  I had alot of input on the "big warrior change" that finally made warriors a viable class with the fabled "MR, HP, and Crit patch".  But, what about rangers?<P>First off, I'll admit, I dont play a ranger.  My main "play characters" are warrior and enchanter.  My "test characters" have been rogues, monks, and a little bit of bards, but the bard was a long time ago.  To say the least, I really consider myself an expert on the balance of melee classes, and I think this is important to know because of what I'm about to say concerning Rangers.<P>If you consider rangers in the "melee" department, I think they are fine.  This means, melee damage, AC, etc, I think they are fine.  While it is true that rangers get their asses handed to them, what would you propose instead?  I've read all the arguments.  "Raise the defensive caps, but keep AC the same", "Raise AC, but keep the lower defensive caps", "Lower the 'bugged' aggro factor of Rangers", etc.  My question is, how much?<P>If you remove the "disciplines" of the melee classes, the Ranger is VERY close to the melee damage of a warrior, and even surpasses it sometimes if his equipment is better than the warrior's.  Rangers have a large abundance of very powerful 1h weapons.  Throw in the fact that many of those weapons proc, and you have taunt-city.  On top of that, rangers kick and cast aggro spells from hell (DD, and snare, etc).  Personally, I think Verant has their back against the wall with Rangers.  The last class that had this kind of outcry was the rogue.  And now, rogues are overpowered in my mind, and I'm sure Verant is aware of this.  The only reason THAT issue isn't being brought up is because of this huge ignorant view that the majority player base has that they "still suck".  That is changing very quickly, and soon rogues will be up for a nerf. haha That is a different subject.  The problem is, how is Verant going to change the ranger class without overpowering it?  Its melee output is very close to a warrior's and when you throw spells in and procs, it surpasses it.  Throw in the ability to SoW, Snare, DoT, etc, and you have a very powerful class. Its only downside is its uncanny ability to also get its ass smacked.  The problem is that any small change could end up turning into a very big one.<P>1) I propose that rangers should not get higher AC. <BR>2)I propose they SHOULD get a higher dodge cap, but all other defensive skills should stay as is.<BR>3)I propose they should get a better selection of 2h weapons.<BR>4)Finnaly, I propose they get a new line of spells.  These spells would basically INCREASE the taunt ability of whomever it is cast on.  Of course, this spell would be group only, and, would not be able to affect anyone unless they are actually using the TAUNT skill.  Thus, it would be applicable to SKs, Paladins, Rangers, and Warriors.  With this spell (which would have a fast cast time, recast time and mana would have to be balanced, and the duration would be extremely short), the ranger could basically make someone in his group a better taunter for a short period of time.<P>I originally had this spell idea for Necros; Scent of Blood.  This would make the creature smell blood on the recipient, and thus focus more on that person when they activated TAUNT.  However, due to the recent changes made to the necro, I feel necros have their place in Norrath and this spell would be alot better suited for Rangers in their current plight.<P>To be honest, this may not seem like alot.  However, after play testing and balancing SOOOOOOO many issues with Verant, I have come to the startling revelation of how MUCH a LITTLE really is in the world of "balance".  What seems like a "little" today, is the best thing since rice 6 months from now.  If you just start messing with AC, Dmg, Weapons, etc, then it becomes too cut and dry, and eventually, the ranger will be too powerful, I assure you.  This new line of spells would encourage teamwork, would require new tactics, and most of all, would help not only rangers, but groups in general, which would make the ranger even more enticing to groups.  Hell, a class that could improve the taunt ability of a tank...thus allowing clerics to focus on 1 member for heals? heh  Trust me, this would definitely solve the issue, and then add a little extra to the "group friendly" aspect of Rangers.<P>Just my 2 cents.<P>Pezz Kneecrusher</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>As a ranger:<P>a) I trust Sunmoon to represent my views to you.  He speaks for us.  We have his Glade to focus our thoughts and it works.<P>b) I am curious why your customer service is so inconsistent.  A simple update telling us if you agree something is wrong or not when we point it out is expected, and after months of asking we got an acknowledgement that you thought Rangers needed some fixing.  And then a simple trite response of 'we are working on it' would be appreciated when we point out further problems or more evidence of the original ones.<P>c) I feel bad for wizards considering they need improves too but never get any attention.  Do you even realize how much better the other caster classes are than wizards?  Do none of your employees even play the game anymore?<P>d) I enjoy my class.  But then I'm only level 43.  I do not enjoy seeing the 50+ rangers in my guild quit the game because they have even more problems levelling then the other 50+ classes.  It makes me angry that YOU, one Brad McQuaid, are a gamer like me who enjoys role playing games, and yet do not care what we think about the game that YOU make.  You disappoint me.  I hope the other game producers learn from your mistakes and I hope you do as well.<P>--And you trolls lay off Sunmoon.  The guy runs the best class-specific website out there and goes to great lengths to fight for the class.  Like most of us, I don't play other characters.  This is who I am.  If they aren't fixed when I hit 50, I'll be cancelling the next day as well.  I enjoy your game but you guys give new meaning to the term 'poor customer service'.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Speaking as a ranger who has been a ranger since March of 1999, I have found the continued cluelessness of Verant about Rangers to be disheartening at the very least. Abashi quite clearly does not know the complete frustration that rangers at high levels experience and it's really starting to p@ss me off.<P>Back in the day, we would post concerns politely to the rangers list and Brian Hook would review them. Slowly but surely changes were made. I miss those days. Certainly any fool can look at the number of rangers who now log time on alts to see that there must be a major problem no matter what the statictians say about rangers versus "you  name the class."<P>Sunmoon is someone to be very much respected who has worked on the ranger class for longer than anyone else including those at Verant. We have no one that I can name now who is a champion of the class internally who has come forward to say "Yes, I will help you like I did with class armor or the ebon blade or in introducing the Ghoul Messenger or CoF Quest."<P>If Sunmoon is frustrated, then the problem lies with Verant and not with him. Abashi should be ashamed to make such a statement.<P>This is probably the first and last post I make to this board.<P>Woodsorrow - Level 51 Ranger - Povar<BR>(Always the Primary)<P>Celila - Level 51 Cleric - Povar<BR>(Forced to be the Seconday)<BR>&lt;The Harmonium&gt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Sometimes when looking at the posts here, it becomes disheartening how easily:<P>"Passion" can turn into "Anger"<P>Its noones fault. I think we have all been guilty of this sorta thing at one time or another. Myself on many occasions. In retrospect, it is an inevitable element of human nature.<P>A long time ago, I wrote a little poem to Brad McQuaid. It basically told how Everquest development was thankless in the same way as Columbus's efforts were thankless.<P>"Recognized, yet scruitinized."<P>Looking back at some of my cleric posts, I kinda now feel bad about how my tone had changed, and how frail a mindset can be when passion comes into the fray. I dont play anymore, and havent for months, but I still believe that this game in itself is a groundbreaking achievement never seen before in the virtual world of bits and bytes. This is why I and many other retirees still follow the game despite not playing. <P>Flaws, errors, sure... it is built by humans, after all. And when you see the response like this from Brad, you cant help but put yourself in his shoes for the moment. You can tell he takes these posts personally sometimes even though its clear that he should NOT. You would think hed be calloused by now, but he is human too.<P><BR>Alb </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I for one almost never go to the Rangers Glade website, and I'm a ranger. Why? Because its never updated, the forums are full of whining posts like this. If you play a ranger and you aren't having fun playing it, stop playing it. I don't think that there will be any improvements to the class in the short run. In the long run, there might be, but who knows.<P>If the class is lacking NOW, stop playing it. When/if it gets improved/fixed, then you can justify playing it again. Until then all you are doing is giving yourself an ulcer. I play my ranger everyday because I like playing it. I don't look at the negatives I look for the positives. When the negatives start wearing on my mind too much, then and only then will I stop playing it. I have other classes that I play as alts, if the ranger class becomes too onerous for me to play anymore I will play one of them.<P>If Verant isn't working on the ranger problems and:<BR> <BR>1) You KNOW they know what those problems are because they have been posted here plenty of times.<BR>2) You are dissatisfied with this fact<BR>3) You still play your ranger.<BR>4) You keep posting repeat posts about the same things that have been posted for months now.<BR>5) You see that nothing is presently being done to address the issues.<P>If you answered yes to the above and you still play your rangers, and get upset while playing them, then you are stupid. Plain and simple, you are submitting yourselves to the pain. If this class is not FUN anymore, yet you still play it for WHATEVER reason, you have only yourself to blame for the lack of fun that EQ brings to you. This is a game, its meant to bring you enjoyment and entertainment. If you're not enjoying it, and its not entertaining anymore because there are problems in the ranger class, then you have 3 choices;<P>1) Do nothing, keep playing your ranger. Even with its faults.<BR>2) Quit the game.<BR>3) Pick another class to play and give up on the ranger.<P>If more people would choose 2 or 3 then maybe Verant would take notice of the lack of high level rangers after a time, and do something to correct the issues. Choosing #1 is showing VI that even with all the problems that rangers say they have, you are still playing them and why should  they bother fixing it. Boycott the class if you think it will help. If you aren't willing to make the effort, then neither will they (VI).<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Sunmoon, I've known you through the wonderful commnunity of the Glade for over a year now. I've come to respect you as a reasonable, selfless, and intelligent man and greatly appreciate the effort and sacrifices you have made for our class. I myself spent over a year of RL time dedicated to rangers via my leadership of the Silvan Rangers and share your devotion to rangers. Most people who play EverQuest have not had the experience of growing from a young ranger in the vast, unexplored world of Norrath, slowing acquiring understanding, increasing our skills to a deadly level, and then suddenly found our once proud selves left without a niche in the newly bigger, and different world. And this suddenly large reduction in the utility we spent so much time acquiring has lead many of our brethren to committ suicide of sorts and leave the world of Norrath. Since the discovery of Kunark, our brotherhood has seen the loss of Elderan, Charron, Zarth the Scaled Claw, and now Sunmoon along with many other skilled members. It is quite depressing to me as a ranger to be considered one of the most skilled practitioners of my class on Fennin Ro, yet at the same time to constantly defend our brethren against non stop belittling from others who think rangers 'suck' both on the boards and while I struggle to read tells through constant messages of 'You will not evade me Faelagund' scrolling off my screen in Old Sebilis.<P>This being said, rangers don't 'suck' and rangers aren't 'worthless' in post 50 groups. I really have very little problems finding groups even though I'm disliked by a lot of my server due to being very blunt and expecting a lot from people :/ However, Rangers do have many issues that seem to be ignored by Verant. Its ridiculous that our dodge/parry/riposte are lower than plate classes who get considerably more AC than us both from skill caps and better armor (and who in reality shouldn't be able to dodge/parry/riposte for crap in full plate mail). Its sad how pitifully low our hp's are. Its a tragedy that two weapons that would go a long way towards keeping us alive (the fayguard parrying dagger and fayguard bladecatcher) will far more frequently cause the deaths of our groups due to their 29damage ae proc. Its unfair how all hybrids got shafted hardcore on Kunark armor and saw a lot of our most useful spells that we give up so much melee prowess for be given to pure melee classes while we get duplicates of spells we already had with long cast times. Did Abashi not say that Rangers are balanced by their utility? Well properly equipped rogues and warriors can increase their running speed, cast strenght buffs, dispell buffs, and restore stamina (stupid ability, but something that verant deemed so important as to give rangers THREE ways to do it with 2 of them taking up post 50 spell/armor slots). Rangers also get ZERO level 49 druid spells while Paladins and Sk's get some of the best 49th cleric and necro spells. So in conclusion, a well played ranger does not suck by any means, but we seriously got shafted in Kunark. Its about time Verant woke up, listened to their customers, and 'balanced us'<P>Faelagund Silvanfather<BR>Retired Guildmaster, Silvan Rangers<BR>Outrider of Fennin Ro<P><BR>PS: For all those ignorant jerks on this board who feel they have to slam or at least throw in their ignorant 2 cents in on everything even when they lack the slightest bit of perspective on the matter, get a life. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>MaWenTao:<P>It IS a class envy whine (you obviously didn't read my last post carefully) because, while it doesn't compare the inadequacies of reangers directly to other classes, it is still asking for changes that potentially create OTHER inadequacies in OTHER classes.  You want rangers to be super-tanks... Verant says it won't happen.<P>Look up the word "by."  Then look up the word "design."  If your dictionary is one that includes phrases, look up "by design."  What part of those two words don't people understand?  If you don't like it, go play Quake.

</FONT><HR>Erolas, I'm not whining. Anyone can attempt to defuse points they cannot reasonably address by resulting to marginally insulting phrases such as that. And just because YOU feel fine, doesn't mean that everyone else does. Are you whining about whining now?<P>FrodoLives, it is class envy. It's class envy of the class that exists pre50 that's called a Ranger.<P>By stating that any changes would be unbalancing, you are presuming that the current state post50 is a state of balance.<P>However, it is important to note, if Verant is perfect and maintains perfect balance, then why did they feel the need to change the core capabilities of a class to make it balanced... But if it was already balanced, why not maintain the balance? Perhaps Verant's change in direction of the Ranger wasn't based on balance, but on a desire to change a role?<P>And once more I point out that Rogues have the SAME Defense, Parry and Riposte as Warriors and HIGHER Dodge, yet they still need Evade to be viable!<P>Rangers are fighting at level 60 with the SAME Dodge, Parry, Defense, and Riposte that was capped for them at level 40-45. This is 118 points LOWER than Paladins. 118! Now look again at Rogues compared to Warriors...<P>The goal of comparing to other classes is to point out the REASON Rangers are suffering.<P>Hey boss, you upgraded everyone's computer and monitor but only upgraded my monitor, and their production went up. You expect my production to go up just like theirs, but you didn't give me the tools to do so, what's going on? <P>Is that envy? </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Letholas, my original post was directed to the author. You took it upon yourself to initiate contact. Do not turn this around now.<P>I was stating that Sunmoon's post came off sounding pompous. I was also stating that I do not have a leader.<P>I have 80 hours under my belt playing my ranger. He is the only class that I play. My opinion counts just just as much as any other.<P>Once again I say with certainty the Sunmoon is quite capable of handling his own affairs on this board. I don't need ranger rhetoric thrown in my face by one of his followers.<P>These posts (and many others like it) have hurt the ranger class by alienating the class from the rest of EQ. When people keep calling ANY class worthless and broken, others buy into this.<P>I resent being looked upon as a walking snare machine. My talents are many. Some would like to portray me (a ranger) in a negative and limiting way. I will always go out of my way to try and show the positive side.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>someone a page or so back made a post about the memory of players, how when other verant games come out we will remember the relationship we have had. but i dont hink that they really care about that, i mean, they have been wildly successful, and that alone i think is great, im not against making a bloomin killing whenever you are able. but the point is, i think aradune can retire as of a year ago and spend the rest of his life tying out local donut shops and seeing the sights all over the world, from his own privat yacht, when we make the point that no one but newbies will buy any more of their products, can you not see the verant employees giggling? they say to themselves, so what? my motivation for listening to you is????? i remember a lead programer for the original doom, im probably spelling his name wrong, but here goes, john romero, he was hired to make a new game, from what i read he was sooo arogant it was silly, 'hi, im romero, john romero.' he only spent a couple days every two weeks in the office, his opinions were the word of god, after all he is john romero, quake was partly his baby, he knew what gamers wanted. anyway, they finally make their game, which ended up being such low quality verant would not even consider publishing it, assuming they would have been offered, because i think even verant has standards, im just not sure what they are <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">and romero is back off somewhere driving his nice car, think he cares the game did not make it? maybe it injured his pride? but thats all, financially no difference to him at all. so we are going to have to think of a better response than 'companies are entities that gather a reputation, if this company keeps screwing it players it will get a bad reputation, players do not buy games companies that have bad reputations.' because we still have not given them a reason to give a damn about the problems with the product.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Erolas, I'm not turning anything around.<P>I merely pointed out there was validity to his statements that you apparently missed. Without knowledge of that validity, of course he sounded pompous, if... he claimed to lead all Rangers, which he didn't.<P>What I and then a few others have done, is remind Sunmoon that he indeed has our support (meaning those who have stated so), because it can be disheartening to see such statements by someone else such as what you've posted.<P>I'd say there was nothing highlighting the Ranger class in a 'positive' manner in your post. You merely insulted another Ranger("Talk about being full of yourself."). I'm sure that helped turn opinion around on Rangers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
