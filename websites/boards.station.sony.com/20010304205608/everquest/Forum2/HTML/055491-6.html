</FONT><HR>Well, my last message wasn't read, so I'll sum it up to make it easier on your eyes.<P>1:  Don't up Paladin defense to Warrior level.  Warriors are the best at fighting, thats all they can do.  When Paladins whine about defense, tell them to play a Warrior sometime and see what its like to go without healing.<P>2:  Fix the 1 handed weapons.  There aren't many 1 handed weapons that are worth using over 2 handed.  Adding shields with procs (good idea) would help, as would making bash more useful.<P>3: Quest armor is horrible.  Nobody wants the Armor of Ro anymore.  Do something about it, its much more effective to go camp rygorr.<P>4: So something for low-mid level Paladins.  All these changes are 39+.  I'd like to see something that lower lvl pallies can look at.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>  Absor, I see that the paladin suggestions that seem to be taking the most seriously are the ones that involve raising paladin, dodge, parry, riposte, bash, and/or offensive melee skills, and giving paladins a discipline like defensive.  <BR>I do not oppose enhancements to paladins, but it does concern me when so many of the enhancements that I see seem to take the form of giving paladins most of what warriors have.  <P>  I play both a paladin and a warrior, but I write this post out of concern for my warrior.  Warriors are the best tanks in the game, but you have to realize, they give up a LOT for that, in terms of versatility.  Those of us that chose the warrior as our class did so for one reason: we wanted to be the BEST tank in the game.  To balance that out, we sacrifice versatility.  We don't have the following: Lay On Hands, superior heal, root, buffs, the ability to stun at a distance, and many other useful spells.  When you have sacrificed versatility to be the best at one thing, it is very important that your advantage in that one area not be slight.  The warrior advantage over paladins in tanking has to be big enough to MEAN something.  Just a hp advantage is not enough.  A hp advantage of 600 usually doesn't even last one round against a major ubermob.<P>  The only compelling reason to play a warrior is that they are the best tanks (If I wanted great melee damage output I would have played a monk or rogue).  But, that's not a compelling reason if the warrior tanking advantage is only slight.  <P> Something that I don't think Absor and many others realize is that paladins, for all practical purposes, ALREADY have more hp than a warrior on major raids, because of LoH.  Sure, the warrior may have an extra 600 or so hp to begin with, but LoH heals far more than that.  On most major raids that I've attended (over 200), the paladins already usually outlive the warriors because complete heal is very difficult to cast on such raids in practice, because the 10 second cast time is usually long enough that the spell is interrupted by an AoE spell from the mob. <P>****On major raids, PALADINS CAN ALREADY OUTTANK WARRIORS because of LoH****<P> I am not opposed to the idea of enhancing the paladin class, but can't you guys at Verant do it in a way that DOESN'T infringe upon the one thing that warriors do well?   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

This would be a great addition for a paladin and is right in line with the changes proposed and far more useful than the current form of Holy Forge.<P>Just my thoughts<P>Ironwind Dreamseeker</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>At the moment I can only think of two things to suggest on Paladin improvement that are well in keeping with our class concept.<P>One - At whatever level you deem appropriate, add a discipline that is a gaurenteed taunt and keeps you number one on the mob's aggro list for a pre-determined length of time or until you or it are dead.  In the latter case give it a healthy refresh rate.  This will allow the Paladin to do the ole jump in front of the mob to save a party member's life by giving his own.<P>Two - Give us a spell, again at appropriate level you determine, that casts a Rune like spell on the recipiant, but rather than the damage just vanishing, it is transfered to the Paladin.  So the mob smacks Bob Wizard for 75 points but the message reads, "blow is deflected at Joe Paladin for 75 points"<P>As a defensive tank, my job is to be the best at soaking damage on behalf of my party, not doing a ton of damage output, though some is nice.  That means I take the HP damage and give my life that they may live.  Just a few throw outs, hope you like them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, I don't agree we can tank as well as warriors because of lay hands. We use it on whoever is dying (main tank warrior) and its gone for an hour. So what is your point again? <P>Changes that I would like to see (all high level because grouping is quite easy at low levels and is not a concern)<P>1. Paladin ONLY spells that are USEFULL. Something Unique to the class. THAT IS BALANCING. I don't mean throw us a bone useless spell that heals 100 hp's in 5 mins while the mob is quad hitting us for 300 hp's. Something that no other class has AND wants on a raid. "Grab that pally! we need him for this raid. He has that spell" Celestial whatever is not the answer. <P>2. There is alot of talk about new undead skills. Why? where are all these undead to fight at higher levels? There are not enough undead mobs. Don't waste upgrades on it. Focus elsewhere.<P>3. ARMOR. I have done the ro quests. Very hard but I didn't mind. What I did mind, is when I went to velious and Ry'gorr is dropping with better stats!! This is truly unbelievable. Worse than that, MANY classes can wear it!. Bards with the same AC. Why do any quests for Ro? Again, I have no problem with the difficulty of the quest. It should be hard. But not have same or better armor be a DROP! This need immediate attention!<P>4. Weapons. Better 1hs weapons are needed. Quest weapons are very dissapointing. I have almost aquired soulfire, but sadly, my Mith 2 hander is far better, and 10x easier to get. So I will NEVER fight with the soulfire. Soulfire stats and RO stats need to upped immediately, or the other EASILY obtainable items nerfed. Otherwise there is no reasont to quest for these substandard items. <P>5. We are half Cleric. If the cleric dies WE should be the backup. Not a druid who already enjoys most of the advantages in the game. (port, sow, etc)<P>6. Tank. It has bee said "you are half warrior half cleric. you have an advantage". No we don't. because we ARE just half of each. So in a raid we are NEITHER. I am not saying to tank as well as a warrior. I am saying it needs to be fixed. <P>7. Better bind points. <P>I hope at least SOME of these will be addressed. The spells on the test server are also not what we were looking for, It does NOTHING to make us more raid equiped. Better spells please, and UNIQUE TO THE CLASS. <P>Thank you</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Please fix LOH.<BR>  I know many of my Paladin Brothers have, as have I, used LOH on a dead party member, or on a mob/mob corpse (on occasion due to clumsiness, other times lag). This does not keep with realistic gameplay. Would a paladin, in a combat situation, actually use this gift on one who was already dead, or on their FOE? Neither seems likely. Could you simply make it so that it's only castable on living, breathing pc's?<P> Second, on the topic of paladin armor. It was my understanding that planes armor was going to be reviewed from a cost/reward standpoint. Has this happened? I don't believe i have seen any AC increase in Valorium. And now, with Kunark AND Velious competition, Planes gear seems, for some pieces, rather second rate. Could you let us know where this review process stands?<BR>Thanks,<BR> Winterz</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is my first post ever...<P>Hi Alan. I just have one point to discuss (at the moment, because I have to leave for class in a few minutes).<P>DUAL WIELD<BR>----------<BR>On the second page, you said that SK's and warriors should have dual wield and that paladins should have 1HS and shield.<P>Now, there's nothing wrong with this, but why should SK's have so much more offensive power than us? Assuming we're basically on the same offensive level now, they have DoT's, snares, and a general fear. I don't know much about SK weapons, but it seems like they're allowed to do more damage, and if dual wield is added as a skill of theirs, that increases their damage output even more.<P>So why not give paladins a chance to dual wield? They seem to be on the lower end of the stick when it comes to damage output. Verant might have this position that a paladin should be a sword & shield character, but then why is our epic weapon 2H? That weapon would make a paladin stand out, yet it doesn't fulfill the image that Verant wanted. I'm going off topic, but I hope you see my point.<P>Raising offensive skill caps would be nice, but paladins should get a little more...<P>That's my thoughts on it. I've probably rushed this (I have to go to class in about 0 seconds). But thanks for listening.<P>-Kaiser</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>&lt;****On major raids, PALADINS CAN ALREADY OUTTANK WARRIORS because of LoH****&gt;<P>This is a total fallacy, and I'll show you why :<P>Take your average lvl 60 paladin (if such thing exists...) with 4K to 4.5K HPs against a mob quad-hitting him for 400 pts.<BR>Mob starts pounding on him, he's getting beaten to pulp in a matter of seconds, his cleric starts casting CHeal on him. CHeal will prolly never hit him in time so he LH himself (that's your scenario, usually pallies tend to use their LH on ANOTHER member in the group). So yeah, CH lands and you can add the 2.5K LH healed to his 4.5K HP pool.<BR>Guess what now, mob continues spanking him and his HP bar keeps going down dramatically fast. Cleric starts casting CH... *splat* ... CH lands on a_paladin's_corpse00. Too bad for the pally that he can use his LH only once every 72 minutes, I guess.<BR>So if you add all the HPs "spent" in the fight, and a very short fight to boot, here you get : <P>4.5Kx2 + 2.5K = 11.5K<P>Now take your average 55 to 60 warrior, with anywhere from 4.5K to 6K HPs. Let's even take 5K to be on the safe side. Same mob starts hitting on him, given his superior AC and defense skills his HPs start going down much slower than a pally, but still too fast to his taste. So he activates his Defensive discipline, mitigating the damage received by about 40%. In my book, 40% of 5K = 2K. So anyway cleric has all the time in the world now to land a CH on the warrior who at this point artificially increased his HP pool to 7K. Rinse and repeat for the duration of the discipline, 3 mins, and say the cleric had to CHeal the warrior 6 times during that period. Then after he loses concentration, said warrior starts getting hit to hard and dies.<BR>So let's look at the numbers now, total HPs spent over a 3 mins tanking period :<P>(5K + 2K)*6 + 5K = ***drumroll*** 47K !<P>Bottom line : are you sure you're playing a paladin over than in your dreams ?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>/agree<P>In no way shape or form can a pally out tank a warrior with LoH on a mob beating that we take post 55. Skills such as parry, dodge, riposte all add into the factor. Warriors have offense and defense all the pallys are getting on test is an increase in defense. <P>Rangers= offense<BR>Pallys= Defense<BR>Sk=  Defense<BR>Warriors= offense AND defense<P>Thats a huge difference imo.<P>On a side not, honestly I dont advocate a sheild only skill due to our SK/ Pally epics being Two handed. If Verant is going to add an ability block type or simalar it is ethier a skill or bash associated. Personally I feel it needs to be a skill. A lot of pallys and sks lean towards 2h weapons for added offense and even more do not have there epics <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I would like to make a little more focus on one idea voiced by another person (sorry I can't give credit, you're post got eaten). <P>There was suggestion about a discipline that would be the perfect way to reflect the Paladin's role as a defender. That was the possibility of allowing the Paladin to absorb the damage meant for a party member. Targeting that group member to acitvate the effect would nulify the Paladin's ability to do damage, but from that point on, they would be sacrificing thier own body in the stead of another's. Allowing this damage abosorbtion shouldn't cause significant balance issues. The damage is still being dealt. It is just being re-directed. This disc could easily be the heroic move that saves the day, when used to protect the enchanter who is absolutely essential to restoring order, or the sole cleric from whom the only source of heals is a necessity.<P>The other points that deserve specific attention are: more shields, more 1h weapons, the ability to choose on the epic between 2hs and 1hs/shield combo, adjustment of the post 50 spells and abilities. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here is a quick one for you Absor.  Over on the ranger thread, you wrote:<P>'&gt;"THORNY VINE ARMOR<BR>While not really a balance issue, I've seen you promise to bring these concerns to the developers<BR>on othe Class Talk threads, so I wanted to post my support for increasing the drop rate. Actually, the drop rate isn't the problem. It's the number of mobs. Count the number of tentacles and then count the number of Amys (SK drop mobs). There are an average of 7 tentacles that pop in a full spawn. However the number of Amys is on the order of 30 or so I would guess. Why would you place the most mobs there for arguably the least popular class? Clean out some of these Amys from around the temple and add some more TTs."&lt;<P>I'll add this.'<P>Paladins have a similar problem.  The drop rate again is not the problem, it is the number of spawns.  And in our case, it is the nature of the spawns.  Count how many Male Fetid Feind Spawns there are?   Find any?  That's right, there are NONE.  There are Fetid Feind spawns that have a 50/50 chance of spawning a male or female fetid feind.  This can mean that entire clearing of the plane of fear can find as little as 0 male fetid fiends and as many as all fetid feinds, leading to a famine or feast approach.   I think most paladins would prefer to have to the static spawns set to 80% male, 20% female (since there are more Valorium peices needed to drop as opposed to the belt dropped by the female version).  You can leave the roamers on this random spawn, since it adds the flavor that was intended without penalizing paladins.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Kaiser, go back and read, he didn't suggest giving SK's duel wield (lol, can you imagine what the warriors would say?) he said they would use 2h'ers and paladins would use 1h+shield (to paraphrase).<P>To those warriors out there who fear that paladins will tank as well as you... You don't need to worry about that. Paladins don't even come close to dealing the damage that (well, pretty much anyone wearing armor and weilding a blade, but PARTICULARLY) Warriors.<P>I love the idea of a spell/discipline that would allow me to divert damage from one player onto myself. If you implemented this idea I think you would satisfy 90% of the concerns of a vast majority of the paladin community.<P>I'm sad to see you say loh will never be a complete heal. Why not?

</FONT><HR>Not sure if this has been said already.<BR>But I was on a Hate Raid last night and my LOH was gone. Our enchanter was being beat on so I used Divine Favor. I was hoping to get that spell off and then the cleric or I could cast a healing spell with a longer recast time. Anyway, I think that at the level we are using this spell that the damage absorbtion should be uped a bit more. You can increase the recast time if you must, but usually we are trying to save casters who don't have many hp's and they are being beat on by stuff double and triple attacking for over a hundred. Realistically, that damange absobtion shield juts won't take enough for us to be able to get off a heal spell as well.<P> <BR> <BR>All times are PT (US)<BR> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have some more ideas for the Paladin/SK classes:<P>Block Discipline - I know this has been brought up, this is just an idea for implementation.<P>1.  Paladin must have a sheild.<BR>2.  Discipline raises AC by 50.<BR>3.  Discipline raises resists by 20.<BR>4.  Discipline causes paladin to take all hits for the group.<BR>5.  Discipline lasts 30 seconds.<BR>6.  Paladin attack drops by 50.<BR>7.  Can't bash while using block.<BR>8.  Paladin also takes the damage for spells (as if group were crouching behind the paladin and his sheild)<BR>9.  Base re-use time of 60 mins at level 50 which lowers with level.<P>When I picture a paladin facing a dragon, I envision the paladin with a mighty sheild that protects his party from damage.  This discipline will probably cause the paladin to die alot more on a raid, but will give him some usefullness.  30 seconds may seem a tad long for this discipline to last, but chance are that the pally won't live for 30 seconds while using this discipline (maybe with LH).<P>In my opinion, this would truly make us defensive warriors that protect the group from damage.  It would also solidify our role in a group.  This discipline could be used for SK's also.<P>--------------------------------------------------<BR>Group LH - This has also been brought up, I just wanted to say I agree and give my reason.<P>Make LH a group heal post level 50.  Reason I say this is because LH loses it's effectiveness post 50 because healing 2k on a single player won't swing the tide of a battle post 50 like it will pre-50.  <P>In a pre 50 encounter, it is common for people to ask if LH is up or not before going after something big (like giants, Lguk mobs, etc.).  Post 50, this is never asked because it really doesn't make much difference.<P>SK's don't really need a mirror to this ability simply cause HT will already get them in on alot of big raids (especially since the upgrade).<P>--------------------------------------------------<BR>Sacrifice - I have seen this posted.  I would like to share an idea for implementation.<P>This ability could work like this:<P>1.  Paladin dies<BR>2.  Group gets 20 seconds of invulnerablity (Message could read:  Diety XXX acknowleges Paladin XXX's sacrifice)<P>This is a neat idea and also is neat for the role players.  This could also work for SK's since they also are devout followers of there diety.<P>I can't really think of an SK mirror to this ability  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">.<P>--------------------------------------------------<P>Defensive Aura ability<P>This ability would add AC and/or hp to all group members.  Paladin prays to diety and diety grants the wish based on factions with worshippers of the diety (ie the guild the paladin is from and the associated cleric guild).  When this ability is activated, it would stay till the group is disbanded or the paladin dies (giving paladins something to stack with cleric buffs).  <P>Message could read "Paladin XXX prays for the well being of the party" and the paladin would kneel when activating this ability.<P><BR>SK's would need a mirror to this ability, so here it is:<P>Revenge ability for SK's<BR>This ability causes the attacker to take 10% of the dmg inflicted on the group.  <P>The idea being that the diety is mad at the attacker for beating on his creation.  So when attacker hits, the diety couteracts with 10% dmg to the attacker.  This would be a group ability that would essentially be a dmg sheild that doesn't take up a buff spot.  It would scale to level of attacker automattically since it is 10% of the dmg dealt.  So if a rat hits you for 10 dmg, 1 dmg is returned.  If a Dragon claws you for 800dmg, 80 dmg would be returned.  <P>The message could read "Diety XXX swears revenge for SK XXX"<BR>--------------------------------------------------<P>Summary<P>I have posted these ideas simply because I see the paladins strength coming from his faith.  I also see a paladin as one who is able to take a beating and persevere through faith and skill.<P>You will notice that all these things are group oriented.  This is because I would really like to see paladins wanted more for groups. These abilities would probably get us invited to more raids an such.  At the very least, people won't be so reluctant to let us come along with them.  I hate seeing posts for pickup raids that say "Only a few paladins will be allowed to come" but I can't blame them since we don't have much group utility.<P>Caeelar Grailchaser<BR>51st Cavalier of Tunare<BR>Infinite Realms on Erollisi marr </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan,<P>Once again thank you very much for this opportunity.  I've read through your initial replies and I'm very encouraged in what I see there.  Right now the big thing that Paladins need more than anything is some type of discipline, series of spells, and/or an ability that will make us useful on large scale epic raids.  It was a big disheartening to see you shrug that aspect of these talks at first, but I was VERY relieved to see that as the posts and replies went by, you started to realize that this is needed.  This is the big one for us, everything else is merely icing.  If we get the enhancements from Test and something that makes us Raid useful, the Paladin problem will, essentially, be fixed.<P>For those warriors out there who wish to bash us, please think about what you are saying before flaming us.  With the extra Defense, we will still be extremely far behind you in terms of AC.  Hit Points are a huge difference as well.  When it comes to Uber Mobs, that difference will allow you to live while we would die.  We don't dare try and draw aggro since we will go down in a matter of seconds.  I also keep reading about LOH making us more surviable, well the truth is it makes everyone a bit more surviable.  At high levels, no Paladin saves LOH to use on himself when someone else needs it more.  Our damage pales in comparison to yours.  Warriors will never be replaced by Paladins or Hybrids.<P>Thank you</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

If the raid is unsuccessful, this means the paladin will die, and death brings back the ability to use LoH.  If the raid is successful, then it will always be more than 72 minutes before the next ubermob is attacked, because of the time involved in ressing the dead, dispersing loot, porting people to the next ubermob, clearing your way TO the next ubermob, buffing up, etc, etc, etc.  <P> What this means is that a paladin will almost ALWAYS have Lay on Hands available for any ubermob encounter.  Again, complete healing is extremely difficult to cast when fighting an ubermob.  In fact, I consider myself lucky if I get any heals at all on such raids.  Thus, LoH is an EXTREMELY powerful ability for major raids.  It effectively gives the paladin MORE HP THAN THE WARRIOR ON MAJOR RAIDS.  If you don't believe me, Absor, just stop by and watch any major guild raid against Trakanon or other ubermobs that cast AoE spells.  The last tanks standing will not be the warriors.  It will almost always be the paladins.   Level 54 paladins REGULARLY live longer against ubermobs than my level 60 warrior.  <P> Mythral-CN, your entire argument is invalid for a couple of reasons:<P> 1. For all practical purposes, paladins and warriors have THE SAME AC on major raids, because both will be buffed up to over 1100 ac, which is the soft cap.  It doesn't help the warrior to have an AC higher than that.  If you don't believe me on this, consider the fact that paladin DW armor is *MUCH* easier to obtain than cobalt, AND paladins now will have the same defensive skill that warriors do.   So, the warrior ac advantage is meaningless. <P> 2.  Most damage on major raids is not done by melee hits from the mob.  Most people are killed by the mob's AoE spells.  THAT is where the real damage is done.  So here is the way things typically happen:  Warrior starts out with 4600 hp.  Paladin starts out with 4000.  20 tanks are on the raid, only 1 of which is being hit by melee at a time, but ALL 20 are being hit by the AoE.  Thus, the paladin and warrior hp will go down AT ROUGHLY THE SAME RATE.  Now, when the paladin hits his LoH, suddenly he gets a BIG boost in hp, which means warrior dies, and paladin gets a new lease on life.  This DOES mean that the paladin has more hp (and thus better tanking ability) on major raids than the warrior does.  As you said, usually complete heals don't happen on major raids, so generally all you have are your starting hp.   <P>  Again, just to make sure Absor sees this if he reads down this far:  <P> ****Because of LoH, against ubermobs, PALADINS, IN EFFECT, HAVE MORE HP THAN WARRIORS DO**** </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sorry for the double post.   <P>Angelwatch said "Lay on Hands makes everyone a bit more survivable.  At high levels no paladin saves LoH to use on himself when someone else needs it more."  <P> I agree.  Sounds like a VERY powerful ability to me.  The fact that you can use it to save ANYONE (not just yourself) makes this ability even more powerful.  So, why would anyone say that paladins have nothing to offer on a major raid?<P>  Just think of whatever class you think is the most useful on major raids and then realize that the paladin can double (or close to that) the survivability of one member of that class on a raid.  That alone ensures that paladins can make a major contribution to a raid, even if they did zero damage during the fight. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>Mr Burly Gnoll...<P>Even with the same Defense skill cap, warriors still enjoy a built-in AC boost, higher AC on their armor, much better Riposte/Dodge/Parry caps, and more HPs.<BR>Regarding Kunark boss mob encounters, which usually feature dragons with AE-breath, everyone is in the same boat regarding AE-spell damage, granted. But you tend to forget that those dragons do also melee with double-hits ranging from 400 to 700 points also. And who do you think will make the difference when it takes to tanking those melee attacks. Yep, right, warriors again, thanks to Riposte disciplines. And if your paladin keeps his LH to save his hide instead of buying time for his cleric, caster or, yep, warrior in his group, he's a lousy paladin indeed.<BR>And when it comes to Velious mobs, almost none of them use AE-breaths, and most exclusively melee for quad-800 hits. That's where warriors come again with their Defensive discipline.<P>LH does nothing to help tank in boss mob encounters, nor is it designed that way. Disciplines are the only way to go, and guess who has such disciplines ? EVERY melee class currently except paladins and SKs.<P>Kinda weird for a so-called "defensive" tank, no ?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>#1.  We as far as being on even or balanced footing with melees like rangers or warriors will never happen.  <P>So that being accepted how about making us needed in someway on ANY post 50 raid?<P>Our one ability that other melee's have but don't use and is nearly worthless past 50 is BASH.  Make a Paladin's bash more effective.<BR>How about upping the damage with our bash attack, or giving it a Taunt Factor?<BR>I am a 51 paladin who with Str buffs generally has 161 Strength. Then during combat reflexively use Yaulp; this gives me a 180ish or so strength during combat. My bash hits for 8 to 12 points of damage and the stun effect is non-existent at that level.  <BR>Increase the Bash skill, or the stun effect to where we have SOME chance of stunning post 50 mobs.  And ADD a Taunt factor to our Bash!<BR>We as Paladins are only there to taunt, take damage, and LOH on the Ranger or Cleric of the Group at the right moment.<BR>By increasing the Taunt factor we can more effectively protect the casters and do our job while not stealing the thunder from the Warriors or Rangers and remaining a viable option.<P>Next this was put foreword in another post but is a worthwhile idea and bears posting on its merit.<BR>Allow Paladin's to bash with any of the 3 quest 2handers.<P>Any Paladin over 46 who has put the effort into it will have his Soulfire by 46th more than likely.  Ask any Paladin at that level what weapon they use, they 9 out of 10 times wont reply that it is The Soulfire.  Let's face it the damage/delay ratio on the Mithril 2 hander beats the hell out of our quest blade.  I keep my SF (Soulfire) in a bag until my stamina is drained during a long fight then use the SF until the frenzy is over so I can Invigor out of combat.<BR>By allowing paladins to bash with their quest blades, even the SF will see more use.<BR>Now I don't own a Fiery Avenger but I would think this ability would be handy even then...If the Area of Effect Proc. didnt get you and everyone around you killed in the meantime.  (Rethinking the AOE spell on a Paladin weapon might be wise.) We (paladins) are a group only class past 30 and mez is your best friend past level 30.  AOE blasts in a post 50 environment=Total Party Wipeout.<P>Next how about like the Warrior we paladins gain critical, and crippling blows vs. undead at all times.  Warriors have this ability vs. all mobs and are not considered over-powered with a higher attack and defense and weapons skill?  This is not a game unbalancing ability and is more to give the Paladin more of a flavor and individuality.<P>The last thing I would like to touch on is "THE BOOKS".  Making it so the books drop only off the dragons is fine.  Hard quest for paladins are accepted hand in hand with being a Paladin!  Don't change any of that...BUT...Take the level 53 cap off of Paladin against Naggy and Vox.<P>Reasons<BR>First is a 60th level paladin really anymore of a combat demon than say a 52 level warrior? Not really<BR>Second how many guilds invite Paladins to come and clear Giants and such so they can roll for the books? None, participation in slaying the dragon would in most cases give us a chance other than waiting for 56th level and trying to luck out against Kunark dragons.<BR>Third the drop ratio is crazy to start with I have watched a Friend and paladin in our guild who attended every dragon run until he Sadly hit 53 with only once even having the Chance to roll for A book.  <BR>Give us the time IE. No level cap to stay committed for those other 3 hell levels just to be able to attend the Old world dragons.<P>Well that is all for now thanks for reading this and considering it.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Bowen sweared to Draco, "My sword, my service are yours". Where is my sword to serve to my friends ?  How can we help them ?<P>When I met my guild master in freeport, he told me if I could slain trushes in freeport ...  Long after that time, my friends and I achieved what he had wanted.I got Soulfire. Some of my friends got KoS against Militia. Now, if I took that sword in hands, do you know what would happen ?  Warriors would ROLF, thieves would chuckle, clerics would think that decorated object was a rechargble item or noe. That is the sword you gave paladin as a mark of sacrifice. Yes this is a mark of sacifice. Sacrifice of those who helped paladins, not pladins themselves. How dare do you hope paladins to get this. This is a kind of pXX of froglock fisherman.<P>I feel Fiery Defender as same with Soulfire. (Sorry FD holders.)  I don't wish holy sword as reward. I wish what will make me help others. You made a clear direction. Paladins melee is nothing more than taunting. No one expect paladin's melee to kill tough enemies. In some important battles, paladins are prohibited to attack.<P>I have 2 major requests and 1 minor one.<P>1) Give good nuke spells to casters.<BR>Tanuting is the major way of paladins to serve others. In the recent age, only enchanters need paladins to protect them from enemies with full of anger. In the past, most casters needed paladins services. Because their spells got high hate.Now, Warriors and Rogue get hate, and Rogue evades. Clerics heal warriors. Enchanters make the rest sleeping. Perfect. No room for hybrids and Casters. You should revive the golden team work. Tanks get hate, Casters Nuke. Froglocks rush to casters, Tanks protect them, Clerics heal Tanks.<BR>You don't need to worry about kill stealing. Because when high level spells hit on low level livings, corpse of them will be vanished. Then they can not get any loots.<P>2) Give us the merit of Shield<BR>With AC25 Shield, Without Shield, I can not feel any differencies. If one concentrate on deffence, there should be obvious changes. Please add auto-deffence state as same as auto-attack. During auto-deffence, one can not attack, can not cast. Instead, he can reduce damages enough with a shield.<P>3) Difficulty to hit non-agro mob (minor)<BR>I set up an arrow against a froglock. He is standing looking in the air. I release the arrow. Arrow does not hit him because of luck of my skill. WHY ?  I can hit running orc.<P>Sacrifics is one of the nature of paladin. I dare accept the worst position if you need others to feel satisfied. I will enjoy to conqure the weekness.<P>Thanks for readings.<P>-- <BR>jush<P>PS. I can not play, check the web so much. Then it will be very difficult to respond if some comments were added to this post.

</FONT><HR>___FIX THE ARMOR OF RO QUESTS___<P>Paladins hate the Armor of Ro.  Actually hate is too weak a word, we LOATHE it.  It's damn near impossible to get it at a point in our lives when it would be useful.  That's all we want is the chance to get our class armor at a time when it will still be USEFUL to us.<P>I've seen many Bards in full lambent, many warriors in full crafted, but I've yet to see a Paladin in full Ro.  By the time he got it all, he'd be in better armor.  If any class should have a uniform of honor, it's the Paladin.  My Pally helped an Iksar SK start picking up his dreadscale (just the 2 of us mind, you, no group) as early as level 22.  Yes he was starting to don his class armor in the LOW 20's.  I on the other hand have to kill at least one Sand Giant FOR EACH piece of my Ro!  I have to destroy my faction with fairies and gnomes.  I have to increase my faction with numerous others.  I have to endure some ridiculously boring camps of rare spawns in zones that have ABSOLUTELY NO mobs that could possibly give me xp.<P>The solution is obvious:<P>- Either make Ro easier to obtain,<BR>- or make Ro better.<P>Skellt</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ideas that have not been commented on as of yet:<P>-The Fiery Defender effect is poor - not epic at all. The stun component very rarely (such that I have never seen it) actually stun a mob. This is apparent when proc'ing on a running creature - they don't stop, they just keep running. Thus we are left with a 155 damage-only effect, which is by far the worst of all of the epic effects. The Shadowknight one, for example, does more damage and heals the weilder at the same time.<P>-The Fiery Defender effect is inappropriate, for two reasons. One, this is the *Fiery* Defender, and yet the effect has a magic resistance check? Two, This is the Fiery *Defender*, and the effect is offensive, not defensive.<P>Suggestions: Change the effect to a lure fire-based 100DD plus 8 second stun, a slight upgrade from the effect on the Sword of the Morning. The resistance check change to put the Fiery back, and the stun to put the Defender back in Fiery Defender<P>-Divine Glory, the new 100HP buff added at 53, should be a 150HP, and Divine Strength (60) upped to 300. The reasoning behind this is, the 51 Ranger buff (which Divine X does not stack with), Strength of Nature, gives 75HP and 25ATK. The extra 25HP that DivGlory provides is not enough to counterbalance the 25ATK for melee classes. <P>1ATK is worth more than 1HP. Look at any melee character's HP vs ATK, and HP will be anywhere from 3x to 5x their ATK. Thus, the HP difference in DivGlory vs SoN should be higher than the ATK difference. So a 2x modifier in the HP difference does not seem unreasaonble. DivStrength should then be upped to 250-350 so that it's a clear upgrade from DivGlory.<P>Responses to comments made on this thread so far:<P>-Make more 56+ mobs stunnable. This would help out other classes as well.<P>-Give Paladins crip/crit vs undead naturally (At some level, not necessarily at level 1) .<P>-Discipline for group Lay Hands would be neat.<P>-More 1-handed weapons please! We'd much rather use shields.<P>-Bards and Rangers have better defensive disciplines than us. Is that how it should be?<P><BR>A few responses to a_burly_gnoll00:<P>"because both will be buffed up to over 1100 ac, which is the soft cap."<P>This is just one of those silly rumors, if you have evidence to this point, I'd love for you to post it. But something tells me you haven't done any sort of controlled AC tests.<P>"MOST DAMAGE ON MAJOR RAIDS IS NOT DONE BY MELEE HITS FROM THE MOB."<P>That depends entirely on what you're fighting. Melee is the *primary* concern with Venril Sathir, Velketor, Yelinak, Dain, Vindicator, Tormax, etc etc. Depending on what you classify a major raid, I'd say that there melee counts for just as much, if not more than AOE's overall.<P>"Now, when the paladin hits his LoH, suddenly he gets a BIG boost in hp, which means warrior dies, and paladin gets a new lease on life. This DOES mean that the paladin has more hp (and thus better tanking ability) on major raids than the warrior does."<P>If you're going to puruse that logic, then the classes that can heal themselves: Shadowknights, Necros, Clerics, Druids, Shamen, Rangers, and Paladins all have more 'effective' HP and thus better tanking ability than a warrior?<P>I think not. See what oversimplifying an argument can do? I never use my LH on myself anyway, always on the warrior. Why? Because they make that 2k go much farther than I would.<P>"AND THEREFORE CONSISTENLY OUTLIVE WARRIORS ON THESE ENCOUNTERS"<P>Whee more flawed logic. A necro that sits at the back and doesn't engage could outlive a warrior. Does that mean they're more useful? I think not. A warrior is more likely to die, because they're pulling more weight than most everyone there. Why would the critter attack the paladin who is doing a measley amount of damage?  That taunting warrior with  dual weild is much more attractive.<P>And finally "The warrior hp advantage is an illusion on major raids."<P>Any semblance of logic in your argument is an illusion.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I happen to have RO armor, and yes it was hard to get, but not impossible. If we ask to make it easier we most likely won't get it. What we should ask for is that it is worth questing for. Sadly, it isn't. I just came back from Velious with half a set of ry'gorr in a about a week. The rygorr has better stats and is wearable by non defensive tank classes, shamans, bards etc. WHAT NEEDS to happen is to UPGRADE THE STATS ON RO ARMOR to make it worth questing for. Sadly, it won't be fixed, and we all know it. Most classes have had up to 5 discussions and we are on number one.

</FONT><HR>to help even up paladins i have several thoughts. like others have said we need more 1hs not only would this give those who can not get FA something to use but would aslo make future epic quests for sheilds and 1hs weapons more useful. plus with paladins being "defensive tanks" we should have the option of sheild and sword or 1 BIG sword.<BR>      other then that healing should go up i think the FA and FD quest should be reviewed these are by far 2 of the hardest quests in the game. if this is how it was ment to be our weapons should be added to to meet risk vs reward as well as time vs reward. i have a friend who worked on the FA quest for 3 months straight he went on countless naggy and vox raids and never got his books. I have heard rumors of the books droping off some kunark dragons dont know if this is true but would help also they should be made much much more common.<BR>   that is about all i can think of right now oh that and more hp/ac to help with deffence and that defend disc sounds cool but would rather it be a skill like lh it would always be very useful. help out in those near death encounters. have a time on it like 10-15 minutes between each and can defend for 1 minute perhaps.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

As a Knight, it only seems fitting to have a squire to help us vanquish the evil that fills Norrath.  Wouldn't this put us a bit more on par with Shadow Knights?<BR>(The other idea of Summon Warhorse is similarly interesting)<P>=&gt;Illusion Horse (knight on a steed) -- Since we probably will never get bind and gate, can't we make it a bit easier/safer to make it across the zones to get back to our corpse?  May not be class balancing, but a common desire of paladins.<P>=&gt;Why can't all casting players summon food and drink or forrage?  For that matter, even non-casters (ie: warriors) should be able to forrage.

</FONT><HR>Absor,  it's nice you are spending so much time reviewing all the classes so evenly (that's a joke btw).  I appologize to my friendly neighborhood Paladins, I actually agree with all the changes on test for you. I want you more useful when grouped with me =)<P>And back to Absor, it's very funny to have read your summurization of suggestions by Paladins, and how you ok'd or added to your list virtually every idea you commented on.  YOU'VE yet to do that for Warriors, your only comments? You guys are fine and don't need anything but nerfs.  You haven't read our threads, or if you have, haven't been considerate enough to respond to our ideas/issues past the first thread. At least prove to us you have read it by doing a list that shots down EVERY decent idea we've suggested.  <P>I read the Paladin list. Heck, a number of the ideas you liked for paladins were ideas I read in the Warrior thread.  Basic changes that could help all tank classes.  And I personnally think the test changes are a good idea. Unlike many of my fellow warriors, I really doubt those changes will impeed up, just as you think, since they don't have the other defense skills raised and can't output the damage we can during a fight.  But they will be more useful and that is a good thing.<P>But stop ignoring warriors, just because Verant "thinks" they are fine. We are not, and we have made a LOT of suggestions, a couple of which could at least be listed and brought to the team for consideration.  Hybrids like to whine about how they aren't useful in groups, but I've never heard a Hybrid whine that they can't get away from an annoying green mob when trying to get to a corpse?  Lvl 60 Warriors have this problem, NO OTHER CLASS DOES. NONE!  A monk could FD. A rogue can Instill Doubt.  Hybrids have a variety of spells. All casters have ways to stop a mob and continue.  And to top it off we have no HEAL mechanism.  I don't seem to recall SK's having one either, or rogues. The 3 of us should get something useful.  AT least SK's have weak useless Lifetap spells that do 20hp's of healing when they have 1500hps =)<P>If you want balance, make every class be as naked after death as warriors are. make the Casters wait until they have retrieved their corpse to mem thier spells. THEN you'll find out how badly in need of help we are.  You would never want to deal with the complaints from a move like that, but you're ok with it as long as it's only the baseline staple class for melee.   Use a little common sense too. If so far every class has needed some changes to correct or enhance them, how could warriors possibly be just right?  Somehow the dessigners screwed up 11 classes, but didn't screw up 1 class? That's possible, true, but not a logical way to begin a discussion. One would have to ASSUME all were broken and then work to prove one or more weren't. To assume that 10 or 11 are broken and 1 is perfect and 1 other is basically perfect doesn't seem logical. (though clerics are pretty damn good at thier job, healing)<P>Just give us the benefit of your honest time and effort to read and investigate whether possibly some of the changes we suggest aren't sensible.  I think you'll find some of our ideas should actually be added to all melee classes, as they affect the balance of melee dmg vs caster dmg. Things like Weapon Specilizations to make us better with specific weapons, just like casters get faster and more mana effecient with spells.  <P>Please at least give us your +/- list so we know 4 threads of commentary have actually been read as every other class has been.  currently we all feel you read the first couple pages of the first thread, decided you didn't care what we had to say, you and the rest there felt we were fine, and you posted a message dismissing us basically out of hand and then started getting ready for your trip to Baltimore.  I'm not saying that's what happened, but that is the IMPRESSION you have left us with.<P>Hopeful to hear an actual thoughtful response from you on us,<P>Corrann Darklighter<BR>44th dwarf warrior<BR>Mithaniel Marr<BR>Eq'er since beta IV<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Lola-HOSS said: "This is just one of those silly rumors, if you have evidence to this point, I'd love for you to post it.  But something tells me you haven't done any sort of controlled AC tests".  <P>  Actually, I have.  With ac of 1190 vs ac of 1105 the difference in my average damage taken per hit, was not statistically significant in tests I've performed.  The extra 85 AC brought only a miniscule increase in tanking ability.  <BR>But actually, even without my tests, this is a fairly well-documented fact.  <P>&gt;&gt;&gt; "That depends on what you are fighting." <P> Yes, it does, but as a rule, most ubermobs in the game have very damaging AoE spells.  The reason for this is clear: Verant doesn't want ubermobs to be killable just by adding a bazillion people on the raid.  They want STRATEGY to mean something.  <P>"I never use my LH on myself anyway, always on the warrior.  Why? Because they can make that 2K go much farther than I would."  <P>  So, you can heal anyone on the raid, almost instantly, by 2K?  Ummmm, so how can you possibly say that paladins don't have useful abilities on major raids?  Isn't it useful to heal 2K damage to the warrior, when even the cleric usually can't get off 1 CH on that warrior?   It sounds to me like you DO have useful abilities on major raids, but some of you just want what warriors have.  The fact remains that the paladin's healing ability, on major raids, with LoH, FAR exceeds the number of hp the warrior will save from his higher hp and better defensive ability.  <BR>Also, don't lose sight of the fact that the ability to use LoH on ANYONE is a tremendous advantage.  The warrior can't give his extra hp to a key person who is about to die.  <P>&gt;&gt;&gt; "Why would the critter attack the paladin who is doing a measly amount of damage?"  <P> So, if low damage output is your concern, why not leave paladin defensive capabilities where they are now, and instead enhance their OFFENSIVE skill to match warriors?   Most warriors wouldn't complain if this was done.  Most of us don't mind hybrids getting enhancements.  We just don't want to lose any more ground in the area of tanking.  It's all warriors can do, so of course we don't like to see another class' tanking ability getting too close to ours.<P>  If paladins get their defensive, dodge, parry, and riposte skill raised to match warriors, the warrior tanking advantage will be too slight to matter.  Absor also seemed to look favorably on the idea of giving paladins a version of the defensive discipline.  That would leave nothing but a few hundred extra hp for the warrior.  Can you honestly say that an extra 600 hp is a meaninful advantage against ubermobs that regularly do 1000+ damage in ONE round?  <P> I strongly feel that these changes are coming too fast.  They are coming way to fast for Verant to be able to see what effect they are going to have on the desirability of hybrids.  Many people have (mistakenly IMHO) believed for a long time that hybrids "suck".  That perception, incorrect though it is, isn't going to change overnight, no matter what enhancement you do.  It will take TIME to see what kind of effect the changes that have already been made are going to have.  <P>The removal of the hybrid experience penalty has barely gone live, and now we are about to see another big round of enhancements.  What is the insurance that Verant isn't going to let the pendulum swing too far in the other direction?  Verant has a history of making exactly this kind of error.  I'm just trying to make sure it doesn't happen again.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think pre 50 paladins are fine, the "defensive tank" concept works and from a role play perspective they are very fun.<P>Post 50 in the guild raid end game, they lack a few things.<P>1)Spells-too little too late. I would hope that celestial cleansing and buffs could be looked at.<P>2)Damage output. Pallies suffer from lack of offensive power. Mobs have 10k to 200k + hp and pallies don't contribute enough damage. Spells 10-20 levels under their parent caster class-cleric don't make up for this. <P>Duel wield plus double attack is too much of an advantage over just double attack.<P>Suggestions: A mild form of triple attack, or increasing two handed weapon damage even more (though that won't help with all the parrying and riposting the mobs do). Better 2 handed weapons is another idea. The monk 29/30 staff with unresistable proc comes to mind...<P><BR>3) level 60 discipline. Pallies need some kind of defensive disc, that will allow them to be a main tank in big mob encounters. When Velketor is quad 850 ing you, you need this.<P><BR>I believe my ideas don't infringe upon warriors who are still the best tanks and dish out a huge amount of damage on top of that and have a ton of disciplines for all high level encounters.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I quit playing by Pally about a year ago.  He was only lvl 27.  My friend was playing a druid, which especially at the time, was FAR more powerful.  I didn't want to start another druid, so I started a necro.  Wow, am I glad I did.  (He's lvl 45 now.)  Necros are far more powerful and definitely more fun to play.<P>One of the big reasons for quitting the pally was the spell rings.  I understand that pallys must be worse fighters than warriors to make up for the fact that pallys get spells.  It's only fair.  At level 22, I was happy to be a pally, because despite the fact that I was a terrible fighter, I could buff myself a little to narrow the gap slightly, and partially heal myself after a fight.  Each level after that, warriors fight a little better, but pallys fight only very slightly better, with no new spells.  At 27, the light healing spell that we got at lvl 15 is almost totally worthless.  The gap between pallys and warriors grows every level up to 30.  Maybe the lvl 30 spells would have made it worthwhile, but I'll never know.<P>My suggestion is this.  Space out the pally spells more.  Give them one or two of the lvl30 spells at 26 or so.  Give them some of the lvl 39 spells at 35 to help get them through the hell level.  I can't imagine what it's like playing a lvl29 pally.  Of course, that's why I quit at 27.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055491-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055491.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055491-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055491-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055491-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055491-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055491-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055491&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055491&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
