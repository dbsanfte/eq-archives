</FONT><HR>How about a new fear spell in between levels 5 and 34?  One at level 19 or 24 would be a welcomed addition.  As it stands, soloing between levels 24 and 34 is increasingly tough with the 5 second cast time on the weak fear spell.  Even a 1 second reduction on the cast time for fear would be welcomed.  <BR>Just a suggestion...<BR>Also, necros should be able to grow plants, as in herbs, i mean come on, we have defoliation, if we can take out plants, we should be able to grow them as well.  Have our own greenhouse, little smoke pipes etc...Whaddya think? Warriors drink and get a small buff from it at higher levels.  We necros should be able to toke up, and get a little mana regen boost.<P>=)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Please Please Please don't change lich!<BR>it was play-tested and balanced by your teams the way it is. Lich already takes 23 hp/tick, and when you consider that a 49 necro is gonna have about 950 hp, the spell already kills them quite fast. <BR>I would much rather have absolutely no changes to my class than see you increase the hp taken by 50% per tick. <BR>As it is, there is only *one* item in the whole game that i know of that a necro can use that has a regen effect, and 99% of the necros out there are never going to see it. that's fine, although i would kill for a regen item. Please take into account that the game was balanced with the spells the way they are, and no necro can have lich on for long without tapping something, costing a good deal of mana. even lifetap dot's are far from efficient. <BR>I started a lizzy necro just for the lich line of spells, and frankly would much rather not be able to tap uber mobs if I would have to give up 50% of my solo efficiency for 99.9% of the time i spend playing the game. <BR>I agree that necros are on the high end of the power cycle, and in 99.9% of the game need nothing more added to the class, except improved fd. <BR>What would be perfect for me would be making bond of death, etc, the lifetap dot line, less resisted by uber mobs. This will allow me to get my health back slowly, so i'm not just a crazy mana pump, and it prevents me from doing too much damage to the mob. If our DD lifetaps were unresistable, we would spend all our mana nuking and not pumping, and that would make us more powerful. <P>-snag 49 lizzy necro<BR>weirz 53 pally<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First of all , please make some of our existing spells targetable . Such as<P>Gather Shadows<P>Shadow Sight<P>Please allow us to invis other PC's and give them ultravision . I am asked for these spells almost every day , and wish I could help out . That would be of immense value . <P>Now my first character is only level 34 , an Iskar Necro . So I can not speak for the post 50 ball park , that drasticly different realm . <P>How can you even call that an epic , let alone refuse to address it ? <P>Now please Mr the blue name , can you offer me and hundreds of others some sort of logical or rational explanation of why ? Your lack of acknowedgement , and undertanding troubles me .<P>When if you play this game long enough , eventually you reach a point where it takes 40 well organized post 50 PC's to kill some of these boss mobs . Why is the EPIC weapon not geared for this ? <P><BR>The Necro Epic , Scythe of the Shadowed Soul . I hear we have a darkness spell thats stronger than the effect on the epic . I will cry like hell one day if I have an epic , and some ranger or druid overrides my epic weapon with level 1 snare . Thats just my educated guess . I see that happen every day , snare owns darkness . <P>Smeone who did manage to land the "epic" please test that .<P><BR>In my humblest of opinions , I feel an epic weapon should be a useful tool in post 50 raids and boss mob encounters .  Make it something that has a post 50 use , a purpose , something my friends and I can use and guild raids can benefit from . Please dont leave it a mediocre a darkness spell , could you be any less creative ? Speaking about lack of creativity , need I mention the graphic ?<P>I hope we get summon pet such as mages . They are not the only ones who lose their pets you know . This spell would be god send for any pet weilding class . <P><BR>The fearless pet buff for mages ? Undead pets should be immune to regular fear anyhow , All I ask is that you make the spectre pet fearless .<P>Sure soloing at 20 was great Mr. the blue name . That is no reason for me to be rendered obselete in the post 50 gameplay . <P>All these prices I had to pay , banking , traveling , struggling to find a group , KoS to ALL , just for being able to fear kite out in the open country side at level 20 .<P> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Lizzy What class do you play? We need to know so we can show you the same support you show us.<P>HAving read through this and playing a 53 necro I find it hard to add much.  Yes we need lifetaps that hit and stick on ANY creature within the appropriate limit.  I'm 53 and have never seen Nagafen or Vox because I'm told I'd be useless and only contribute to lag.<P>There is one other thing that has bugged me for ages.  The level 16 spell Banshee aura.  By the time we get this most necro's are already done tanking.  This spell should be at least targetable on our pets (or even pet only) and an upgrade for it would be nice.<P>Finally the pet spells on test for mages.  In an other thread you told us you would not want to give us pets that were immune to fear because you thought mages would then ask for the same thing.  Are the pet summon and pet immune to fear spells going to be implemented for necro's as well?<P>Finally as an erudite necro it appears I will either A) have to carry my harvester till level 60 so I can see or B) Cast DMF and Shadow Sight al the time wasting 2 of our already limited buff slots.  It would be nice to see a high end quest from paineel for an item with decent stats and deadeye (headpiece with blighted like stats requiring drops from the planes, or something like that).<P>Thuldorn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>few things:<P>1)  Fix lifetaps to unresistable within 6 levels on everything.  Its not just uber encounters like dragons that have 100% immunity.  Monsters like reavers in CoM, The Tangrin in FoB, and many many others are flagged as "magic immune" and lifetaps are resisted 100% of the time.<P>2) remove skel illusion, change the effect to a minus 1 str debuff or something (to prevent stacking)<P>3)  I was in upper guk, hit the scryer with an ebolt, then he charmed me (why is it possible for a level 20 frog to charm a level 54 player?) the scryer died while I was still charmed and corpse went poofy.  Fix this if you can, I havent heard of any uber mobs poofing, but I havent been to planes lately.<P>4)If you nerf Lich series, nerf clarity 2.  Right now I often find myself using C2 over lich as the mana regen is very close and there is 0 hp loss.  It's my opinion that the Lich series is fine as is, because of clarity 2.  That level of mana regen is acceptable.  One idea, toss around the idea of making lich castable on others (group only of course)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>IGNITE BONES:  The fact that the skeleton effect screws up targeting isn't just a "Boss Mob" problem.  It's a problem whenever we group with people, unless the mobs are humanoid size.  Give us a sister spell at 50, without the skeleton effect and with identical damage and recast time.<P>POST-50 SPELLS:  I can't understand why the necro spells generally seem so weak or useless in terms of improvement, as compared to other classes post-50 spells.  Compare the lists of each other class post-50 and you'll see what I mean.  Shouldn't balance include balanced improvements within the class from 50 to 60?  I assume the answer is that necros are so powerful at 50, they don't need improvement, but I find that hard to believe.  I'd think that have to be some useful new spells that necros could have that wouldn't give vast damage dealing improvements.<P>GROUP-FRIENDLY:  Sure, everyone knows necros can solo.  But should they have to?  Shouldn't there be some other group friendly spells that would make a necro wanted in a group?  Group DMF, Group Shadow Compact, Group feign death, whatever.  These spells wouldn't have the problem of imbalancing the necro class by making them too powerful when soloing, so why not?  Some of you who play necros know that virtually all our spells are self-only.<P>Essence Emeralds:  How can people still make the argument with a straight face that even if Infusion were targetable, anyone would give up the exp. loss for 1000 mana?  No other spell in the game even remotely comes close to so high a cost.  This spell should at least give 3000 mana and be targetable or the reagent should be changed.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The list that you have Absor, seems to cover all bases.  Now I might be in taking away from Mages, but I think that it would be cool to summon diffrent kinds of pets.  We get Spec, and Skellie.  As cool as that is, I think that those who were the masters of Death could summon other things.  Zombies, perhaps a mummy, maybe even a ghoul.  Each would require diffrent components perhaps.  Zombie skins for zombies, Bandages for a Mummy, etc.<P>Perhaps even the ability to Raise a corpse that has been killed, and turn it into a pet.  (as long as it hasnt been looted of course...)<P>Just a few ideas.  I like being a Necro.  Even if it means I have to change the way I play on the big raids.

</FONT><HR>Everyone try to understand:<BR>1) if we keep the lich line as it is there is nothing they will do to improve the necromancer class.<BR>2) If they “improve” necromancers then the lich line will begin doing one third more damage and up to fifty percent less mana compared to how it is now.  That means a DRASTIC reduction in necromancers’ ability to generate mana from hit points.  Those extra hitpoints he’s talking about taking add up very fast.  /sigh <P>If Absor were on our side he would have more clearly explained this.<P>Let me try:<P>If you have 1000 hit points you can burn 800 hit points in to 800 mana as things are now and still have a bubble of health.<P>With the change if you have 1000 hit points you can burn 800 hit points for 600 mana.  <P>Both of the above are occurring in the same amount of time btw.  Don’t nerf us, please, I beg you.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ummm just a simple question..<P><BR>What is it a mage does on boss mobs?  His spells dont hit either.. oh yeah.. he casts a damage shield.. my bad.. and has a pet.. but wait.. you have a pet too...<P>And you convert your mana... into... damage thru a wizard.. or heals thru a cleric..<P>So... basicly.. in a end encounter.. your mana is used for DAMAGE.. or HEALING.. while a mages is used to summon mod rods.. or cry to his mommy.<P>Chanters?  Boss mobs?  they buff the party up and tuck thier head between their knees and pray to the wizards, clerics, and melees.<P>Incase you didnt remember.. the ONLY class who hits god mobs.. uber super boss mobs.. with spells.. is a WIZARD.. thats the only thing they do well.. Where as your pet can still do some damage.. or warrent enough damage delt to land you a death touch instead of a melee.<P>Honestly.. I am not trying to flame but before you go off screaming that your lifetaps dont hit ANYTHING.. why not look at a mage who doesnt do jack on a uber level raid except buff his lil pet and give damage shields and mod rods.<P>Or the wizard.. who runs out of mana and cant do anything more.. while your pet is still a choppen.<P>Personally.. I firmly beleive that a necro spent his whole life being a solo god.. able to kill things others need a full group for in some cases.  And now that their rolls have a shift.. and they get to use thier mana to produce effects thru others.. you just mad because your set of gold balls have been claimed by other classes who suffered thru levels to be able to do what you have done in thier present the whole time.<P>I got alot of friends who are necros.. And they do their part.. the class is powerful.. <P>I could call the mana transfer thing on god mobs just deserts.  After all.. look at the other casters.  What you think a druid does?  Tosses a wuss heal.. and casts off a nice big fat druid nuke.. to see its resisted.  Jeez people.. <P>You guys are thinking pretty selfish..

</FONT><HR>No offence tough but thing was have mentioned not really big our (necro concern) let me start my long rant here<BR>Long time ago then game was up many classes have some sort of "singature" that were defining class:<BR>Clerics - heal<BR>Warriors - tank<BR>Wizzard - nuke<BR>Enchanter - crowed control<BR>Druid - trevel<BR>Necromancer - Damage over Time<BR>So let me start from it:<BR>Yes as necro we have largest variety of Dot (which still not make us best  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">) - magician, shamans, druids step on our toe<BR>Darkness line - fine as is with 2 possible things to look after - casting time and second thing I really dont undestand why resist rate increase with increase lvl of spell - in other word for me lvl 55 necro cascading darkness (lvl 49) resist on SAME mob 2-3X time more often then dooming dakrness(lvl 29) - it be very nice either make for darkness save vs. desease or put this line in resist bracket as a splurt (also MR based spell) - or at least highest of darness<BR>Heart flutter line - awesome line - good job - good as is (can be land even on trakanon after debuffing)<BR>Heat blood - use to be most devastrative and most mana efficent for trade of duration - not a case it be really great SLIGHTLY decrease duration (say not 108 second but say 72-96 second) or SLIGHTLY increase damage per tic (111 pyrocuror vs 123 devouring darkness) - never the less good line <BR>Leach line - good as is - great job - but be nice remove "melee range" requiement for some high lvl encounter (I really not get why can I land deflux from other side of room on FG in Sold (3.0 casting time) and cannt land bond of death unless I am in melee range (7.0 casting time)<BR>Splurt - single and BEST dot from all necro got over all game - but I really dont undestand a reason why this dot was given to shamans on epic - be nice to have upgrade for it at lvl 60 which can be either same damage but 2x shorter duration or just 3-4 tic to duration of this dot that will yeild nicely ~2400 damage and thus bring back necro on place of best doters - also check bug with splurt heart flutter will stack after splurt but splurt wont stick after heart flutter line<BR>Poison line, Desease line - ok as is<BR>Next thing pets<BR>They fine as they are but please fix drop rate on lvl 56 and 59 pet or at least create some sort of quest as alt way optaining it or put it somethere on vendor with high price (say 5000pp) but not insane like its now (INITIAL bid on servent of bone on Nameless 65000pp)<BR>Next thing DD<BR>Well it sorta funny that mage pet 58 can nuke as good as necro lvl 60 (441 vs. 510) all casting classes have some sort of common nuke ~700 damage - mages got fast dots, druid have lure dots, shaman got spurt - I dont see a reason why necro can get mean DD then - we dont asking for much just adjut damage on chill bones to 650-700 or give us upgrade along poison based DD line (SoP 24, Tobar Acid blast 34, may something at 54 with poison DD around 650?)<BR>I skip usefullness nuke vs plants - we actually dont need it and never ask for more over we dont have mob that affected by this spell by time we got it<BR>Undead nukes - well fine as is tough have limited aplication<BR>Next thing group oriented spells:<BR>Mana transfer - please face fact that having second cleric it MUCH more effective way hadle healing then having cleric+necro. Mana trasfer is UTILITY spell more like emergency rather then for common use. Necro in a nature is vampire - we can drain life, str, AC and I really dont see any reason why we cannt drain mana? - it embarace me then I see "enchanter smile on XX - I feel much better right now" - draining mana WILL give necro chance use mana transfer on more common baces<BR>It be really nice have group verison or DMF/skin like shadoow and lavant - surely castable in night time only<BR>Now we comming to very delicate problem - necro never asked for line of spells that requeid essence emerald to cast - aside moral aspect that I dont think it cool look on it in practical point - can you imagine situation then you can sacrofice someone lvl 51+? I dont <BR>I have I think good idea how this spells can be redo<BR>Convergance - first - move this spell to lvl 55 - second change it to next among 700 mana spell consumes 700hp of caster and ruby and bring taret to live with 1 hp - castable only at night - recast time say 10-30 min - necro do help other but for cost own str (impar str) own health (pact, coral emphaty) own mana (mana transfer) - it be reasonble to do same for necro ressurection<BR>infusion - do you really thing 1000 mana worth few hour of exp of vicitim? do you think casting 1100 life drain for 375 mana worth it? - I dont think so - it be good to either make essence emeralds optainble via quest or drop from high lvl folks say lvl 55+?<BR>As I see now Verant making blue borders between classes SK got necro sommon copse, shamans got necro splurt, druid and shamans gona get better healing - Absor I hope you know that very common role for necro in common exp group is back up crowed control and we DO have nice tools for it (root, darkness, screaming terror) it be very very nice to have ANY upgrade for ST just tiny increase duration say to 24 second and reduce recast time to 2.5 second <BR>And last thing - our pets is undead it be nice to have em INBORN immune to any fear but panic dead and our pets should have inborn high PR/DR resist like undeads do<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>No, <P>I think what he is saying is this about lich:<P>PvP means magic does 66% of what its supposed to do.<P>Lich is being treated like PvP damage, therefore doing 33% less.<P>Lich, in its current state, is doing 32 damage for 32 mana, but should be doing 48 damage for 32 mana.<P>We'd still regain mana at the same rate, it would just kill us more.<P>I'm not sure what to think of that change personally.  I think the cost is too high.  Casters don't have that many hp, and without regen items, like EVERY other class receives (non caster) it doesn't seem fair to give us no way to heal other than a cleric or tapping...  especially when there are no moss snakes in every zone and to keep healed in higher zones means you have to be in a full fight.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alan,<BR>Simple question, why is it that it was decided that necromancers should not be a damage dealer in boss mob encounters? Is it because of our power in the pre-50 game? Seems really odd to change our role so dramatically. From massive damage dealer to a marginally effective support person for support people. Hmmmmm. Can you give us a one sentence why on this?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Necro balancing issues:<P>Underutilized or Never utilized spells:<P>Scent series: The resist on this debuff line is way too high, by the time the mob is debuffed its dead most times. Please review the resist factor on these spells.<P>Undead fear: Currently the regular fear line works just as well on live or undead creatures. I always thought this a bug, and I guess my request would constitute a nerf, but why give us undead fear when regular fear works just fine? Sorta makes the undead fear line useless and duplicative.<P>Word Series and the Enfeeblement series: These are our only AOE spells but they are melee range only. The range appears too small, also it can aggro the whole crowd onto you. Only used these once or twice ever. Either increase the range or reduce the aggro factor.<P>Feign Death: Give necros the upgrade that SKs now have. IF they can get summon corpse then let us have an upgrade to FD.  Also like the idea of a targetable FD as new material.<P>Defoliate and Defoliation: Defoliate is not in game it seems, either confirm its exitence or tell us it was never implemented. Defoliation no plants to give exp at the level this spell is attained. Plant mobs should be flagged as plants! Sorry I didnt buy the spin explanation concerning PoG mobs but did appreciate your candor in your opening statement to this thread - THANK YOU!<P>Ignite Bones/Chill Bones: remove the skellie illusion, the game has evolved and the illusion now creates more problems than the eye candy gives in benefits.<P>DMF: A wonderful buff, but I disagree with the ban of the levitate spells in Kedge Keep. Necros just cast this on folks before they zone in, the levitate only makes it so folks "dont sink" in KK. I have hunted here a lot and the "no sinking" factor is nothing really. IN fact the levitate actually makes it a little more difficult because you have to swim down the tubes instead of just sinking down. I do like the idea of an upgrade like Dead Man Walking grants all the same stuff but without the levitate, makes it useful in those zones where levitate is banned.  Gives the necro a really useful grp friendly role in a few dungeons.<P>Root series: the order of the upgrades are "out of order." Consequently, the necro upgrades are actually downgrades to root. Recommend just elimating the upgrades from the necro class, they just take up spell slots for no real value at those levels.<P>Trucidation/Infusion: The issue has been stated numerous times value is NOT worth the reagent.<P>Levant/Skin of the Shadow/Quivering Veil of Xarn: remove the "night time only" restriction. At the least remove the restriction on the Veil spell, as it is this spell is SOOOO situational that it becomes pointless to waste one of the valuable eight spell slots on for such a small chance you might get to cast this spell. The restricitions basically add up to "why bother" just use regular harmshield. My recommendation, remove the regen component so it will stack with other buffs, and make it so that the extra benefits are only realized if it is night time, but the caster gets the regular harmshield benefits if it is daytime. These would help make the spell practical again. The other two are basically utility and the night time only just means why wait when you can just run there before night time arrives besides necros have other means of escape. The night time only was a unique and creative idea just poorly implemented. Try making something like sacrafice night time only next time!  Another idea a specific DD but dont give it a 10 minute recast otherwise it wont be used - but if we had a slighlty better DD that was good at night time only and had a normal recast we might use that!  It could also be useful on raids - maybe!<P>Trepidation: works worse than our lower level fear spells. Doesnt appear to be an upgrade at all.<P>Emissary of Thule and Arch Lich: These are eye candy and a waste of spell space. Yes I dont have them, but know and play with folks who do have them, dont give me an upgrade with only pretty graphics its pointless and IMHO insulting especially at the same level!<P>Devouring Darkness/Cascading Darkness/Epic Effect: These spells are too costly to cast, most necros just use Dooming Darkness our lvl 29 spell and "bench" the upgrades. These spells casting times get longer yet retain the high resist, high aggro factors. These are DOTS and makes the snare in dungeons more tricky as you cant mezz a dotted mob. Most necros dont care about the damage component just the snare piece. Consequently, the upgrades become spell book filler.  Reduce the casting time and reduce the damage, we dont use them as damage spells but snare spells.<P>Improved Invisibility to Undead: is self-only yet our lvl 1 version is targetable. The undead invis is one of the things that did help necros be grp friendly in undead dungeons but our upgrade is self-only? Besides most undead dungeons have mobs that are either live or see thru invis anyway that could cause the invis to be lost still. Please make this targetable.<P>Conjur corpse: Make this spell available at say lvl 55 instead of lvl 57, especially since SKs just got the lvl 39 version. I have not checked the SK guilds in the various cities, but please make coffins available in other locations besides Neriak and PoA.<P>Spells we never recieved upgrades on but would have been better than some of our post 50 spells:<BR>Siphon Strength (targetable not the AoE), Impart Strength, Reclaim Enegery, Banshee Aura, Grim Aura, Vampiric Embrace, Shadow Vortex, and Screaming Terror. Why is it that necros can not get a targetable Vampiric Embrace buff yet you gave enchanters this buff via the Boon of Garu spell? Why do we get Banshee Aura if we can not target it to pet or others and no upgrade? IMHO I dislike one time spells of this kind it just creates class envy.  After level 50 couldnt some of our buffs start being targetable - we have paid for almost 50 levels with self only buffs less a few exceptions (DMF and ITU).<P>Epic Item: The quests among the classes are NOT balanced in difficulty. I am not asking to make them easier, just make them equal in difficulty. Look at the number of cleric, enchanter, rogue, monk epics for example entering the world compared to necros, mages, wizards, SKs for example. The necro effect is TOO situational, sorry but I disagree with Abashi's logic of "it takes nothing away and provides some benefit" that same arguement could be used on almost any piece of equipment in game. Please re-examine the epic effect, as is some of our Velious stuff is more "epic" than our epic quest reward.<P>Pets:  Necro pets are animations not summons, likewise they are mindless automatons and should have natural immunity to fear or be tied to the necro (if the necro is feared then so is pet).  Mage pets have natural immunities (e.g. fire, poison) so why not necro pets?  Pet resistances are so low they hardly ever resist a spell as it is now.<P>It seems to me that Verant has gotten themselves into a catch 22 situation with necros. You seem to want to promote grouping yet still consider necros a solo charater. Post 50 is about grping and raiding, consequently the spells and tactics that have served us for soloing pre-50 start to break down post 50. In addition, the position that "necros are overpowered" has been the mindset for so long now that I dont believe the class has gotten the attention it deserves just to maintain itself with the evolution of the game. To me this is evident in our spells, epic item, and basic game design of mobs and encounters. Mobs continue to grow in difficulty while the necro is either in a stalemate or losing ground in their ability to do damage to mobs.<P>Thanks Kevin<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>First off thanks for all your time addressing and listening to our concerns Absor.  I know you spent alot of time discussing Raid problems with us and I hope something will come of that.<P>As far as soloing and normal grouping I trueily believe Necros are fine.  Maybe a couple changes would be in order.<P>Direct Damage:<BR>It would be nice to get an upgrade to our Poison DD line [we get one at 24 and the last one is 39th lvl].  Nothing to big but this could be used as a general purpose DD and could even be used to help with Raid problems.  Place it somewhere in the low 50ish range with about the same stats as Defoliation.  Try to remember that our highest general purpose DD is 500 pts and has a hold time to recast.  In groups where mobs die in 20 - 30 seconds our DoTs are really useless.<P>Speaking of Defoliation, thanks for changing some more mobs to 'Plant' based.  At least the spell has some use in the spell line up now  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Pets:<BR>Check into the resistance levels of Pets.  I can tell you they are rather sad in that area.  I have had my 59th lvl Pet 'Slowed' by 30ish lvl Frog Shamans...  Maybe add a resistance buff to our 3 pet buff spells.  This would also assist Necro pets to attempt to resist the effects of AoE attacks from Epic mobs.  Keep in mind that unlike Mages who can summon pets immune to certain types of attacks [and not a flame against mages] we can not.  So the Pets resists are important to his survival and overall usefullness.<P>Just a question but why are Necro pets affected by Poison and Disease attacks?  It would seem that something raised from the dead would be immune to those attacks.  What is there to poison or be affected by disease?<P>Pets need some form of protection against Fear.  I think you have taken the right path on 'Test' with that Mage buff and hope that something similar will be done for us aswell.<P>Why does the 59th lvl Pet still require a Peridot regant to cast?  I know originally Abashi told us it was because the pet summoned 'Auto Duel Wielding', well now that all pets above a certain level do....  There is no reason for the 11pp regeant cost.<P>Essence Stones:<BR>They are only worth using for Convergence [our res spell], after all it is 'a soul for a soul'.  Yet I would never use one for 1k mana or a 1.1k life tap.  I can meditate back to full mana before the spell even cycles to be used and I would never waste an Essence stone for a Tap that only does 300 damage more then my highest non regant Tap.  Seeing both of these spells have rather long recast times [both over 10 minutes] I can not even justify having them memed, let along the high cost of Essence stones.<P>Root Line:<BR>What is the deal with our Root line up?  We get Para Earth at 49th lvl and then get 2 lower verisons of the Root line in the expansion spells[Enstill 53rd lvl and Immobilize 56th lvl].  Keep in mind that Para Earth over writes all verisons of Root [except the wizards Fretter] so what gives?  Did someone just not look at our spell list?  Remove these spells and use those slots for something else.<P>DoT Stacking problem:<BR>Splurt and our entire 'Debuff' DoT line [Cessation of Cor etc] do not stack correctly.  When we recieved Splurt it was marveled as being able to stack with all DoTs.  Yet if Cessation of Cor is active then Splurt will not stack, yet they will in reverse order.<P>DMF problem:<BR>Give us a 'non Levitate' verison of Dead Man Floating.  This is probably our best buff and is not just a Levitate spell.  Yet in a few zones where this spell would be very useful [Kedge Keep is a great expample] this spell will not work because Levitation is turned off.  So give us a verison with out levitation that is just a posion resist buff, See invis and Enduring breath.<P>Night time only spells:<BR>What gives with this idea?  It seems like an ok idea but some of the spells within that limit become worthless because of it.  For example Quivering Veil of Xarn.  This is a nice upgrade to our 20th lvl Harm Shield spell but it is night time only...  So I have to hit my /time hot key just to make sure it is night fall before I use the spell?!?  If I need to use Harm Shield I do not have time to see if it is night time.  Plus there are stacking problems with Quivering Veil of Xarn.  <P>HPs to Mana spells:<BR>Ok so we now know they are bugged.  Do not treat us any differently then you have the other classes with bugged spells.  Fix it and get it over with quickly.  We should be no different then any other class in this regard.  <P>Now what is the point of having 2 mana transfer spells at 60th lvl?!?  Not to mention Archi Lich [60th lvl] has the same HP to Mana ratio as Lich [49th lvl] while Demi Lich [also 60th] is clearly better then both of them.  So why did we recieve a 60th lvl spell that does the same thing as our 49th lvl spell?  Why not make Demi Lich 55th lvl and give it a ratio between Lich and Archi Lich or just remove it and add a new spell in it's place.<BR>  <BR>It seems like VI really did not think thru the Necro spell line up that well.  They had some good ideas but executed them poorly.<P>You should have enough of an idea on raids so I will not recap that subject again  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>As for the Epic, it is not Epic and the quest is unbearablily hard when compared to some of the others [cleric, rogue, chantes].  Something really needs to be addressed on this matter.  The Epics are all so out of balance with one another [in terms of effects, usefullness and difficultly to attain] that it is not funny.<P>Well thanks for listening, I am sure there will be plenty to read  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Briljin D'Aerthe<BR>59th lvl DE Necro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If the tradeoff is "fix" lich series and make taps land on boss encounters I think that every necro would overwhelmingly support this idea.<P>If lifetaps could land on boss encounters the necro class would be FINE.  No other changes would be needed.<P>An aside: What about having the epic summon a no rent/ no drop essence emerald?  This allows epic wielding necros unlimited res's and 2 other almost worthless spells to be cast.  Any necro with this item will be in a guild that has 40 clerics with clickers so its not really overpowered.<P>BTW:  Just obtaining this item needs to be seriously looked into.

First I'll address what Absor has, then add things I think should be addressed.<P>1) Ignite bones: Honestly, I like the spell for changing the mob into a skeleton. It's fun, it's cool, newbies are mystified.. but to face reality, it does hurt the group more than help. My suggestions: <BR>A) Turn large creatures into giant skeletons (as I believe they have the same hit range as giant mobs). If it doesn't have the same hit range, obviously there would be no advantage to this and it should be stripped of it's neatness illusion factor now (grab the screenshots while you can kids, you may never see this in game again.)<BR>B) Simply make a seperate spell. Ignite Bones is one spell, Decay Flesh is another. It does the same amount of damage, with the same recast time, with no skeletal illusion effect. (But Ash, couldn't a necro double up on these and effectively have two nukes? No no, that would be lame.. besides, Verant would counter with a buff code on the skeletal illusion effect much like they did with the Clerical BP. Both spells put a buff on the mob for 10 seconds (same as the recast time) whenever they /successfully/ land on a mob, stopping any further nuking from either of the two spell lines for that 10 seconds.)<P>2) Lifetapping giant mobs. I think we should be able to do this. Absor, I'm not gonna be so pretentious to say necros one main thing is this or that.. we're good at lots of stuff. When it comes to raids though - Dots are resisted, we can't use pets, DD's get resisted (Torbas acid blast) or are disallowed (ignite bones), we can't melee, and we can't lifetap due to resists(which I differentiate from dd's). Admit it guys, we have nothing to do at raids. <P>Quick story that I think sums up to those at Verant how it usually goes with Necros in raids: I'm in a group on Innoruuk that, for about a month now, has successfully killed Naggy and Vox back and forth over a dozen times now. What's been my major role? I've tried to dot, I've waited for tash and malaise, still resisted.. I've tried to lifetap.. resisted.. I asked if I could just try my pet (my group loves me, but not that much). So my main role (and face it, they threw me a bone here cause they loved me) was to  be part of the buffing line with DMF. After that, I stayed in the back and shot healers up with mana. Though I couldn't regen mana cause I couldn't get it back with a lifetap.. and I could barely give much mana myself, since I was having to use it to put runes on myself to keep me from dying due to dragon AE's when the cleric/healer didn't have time to get to me and, again, I couldn't just lifetap and heal myself. So there's the dilemma.. Verant, necros want 'something'.<P>Give us either - <P>1) The ability to not be resisted with dots somehow (hey, we still have to share with other necros on the raid since they won't overlap, and we risk dying even more due to aggro).<P>2) Lifetaps that aren't resisted so we can do a minimal amount of damage, but more important take care of ourselves like necros are usually expected to, and keep up effectively the role of mana battery (even little heals with our pact series, too).<P>3) Somehow make our pets viable in dragon raids.<P>Now to be honest, I just don't see 1 or 3 happening anytime soon. And maybe someone else has a 4 and 5 to add to that list, but I feel those are the three things necros (even creative ones) generally think of. And they all don't work.<P>We'll get to the Lich series discussion later, I promise, just skipping for now.<P>3) Dots and corpse poofing. I've never had a problem with this, seriously, but then with 300k people on board, yes, bugs like this popping up even .2 percent of the time can seem frequent when they report it publicly, tell their friends about it, etc, etc. While I'm more than sure people aren't lying and this has in fact happened, I'm also pretty sure it has been fixed. Also, Absor said they put in coding for it, and as much as I'm prone to.. "Sure, I'll believe it when I see it.", I tend to buy this one. Good job, Verant, thanks for addressing one concern, though that wasn't exactly necro specific.<P>4) Mana conversion rate: Nope, leave it as it is, it's not the most astounding rate right now, but balance wise, it works out. See, even if you did upgrade us on this one, lots of necros would still be mad. We don't wanna be mana batteries in the first place, but if for some reason we're in a situation where we can do nothing else, at least we can offer this as a consolation. Please don't ever think this is some class defining power, or that it's soooo ungodly effective. It's fine, leave it alone, fix the more important problems.<P>5) Infusion: Ok, I'm just gonna go into Essence Emeralds here. (hereto referred as EE's) EE's were a great idea. Seriously, taking the ultimate sacrifice from someone so you can cast spells so powerful that there's literally no other way to balance them is just.. almost epic. Unfortunately, the idea was good, the implementation was bad. Absor, I'm gonna say this once and I don't think you can possibly refute this: We don't use these for anything other than Res's. <BR>What can we do about that? Well man, do like you said, balance the classes.. if you take away those two spells (Infusion and Trucidation) we're kinda getting the short end of the stick on how many spells we actually get post 50, no? So don't leave them there, to necros it feels like y'all are not removing them so you won't feel guilty about the necros having 2 less spells post 50. <BR>So add 2 new spells.. be creative, or just continue a line that you left off:<P>Example: A short duration damageshield that adds life to us for every point of damage that would have been inflicted. (Sure, we'd get to max health in 2 seconds, but then it goes off and we could still die in 2 seconds if the mob is still hitting us.)<P>Or, that one final, giant lifetap that costs an absurd amount of mana. IE. Trucidation without the EE, but costs more mana.<P>Or.. nah, other necros are more creative than I am, I just wanted to put up a couple of examples for you to look at and maybe work with.<P>But what would we do with the 2 spells Convergeance (our res spell) and Sacrifice (our spell that allows us to make EE's)? Leave'em in. It's a perfect balance, honestly. We sac a life, we res a life. That's it! Anything else is just not gonna be powerful enough for you guys to implement without it being 1) Underpowered, like the spells we already have or 2) Overpowered to the point of exploitations. So just take out the last two EE spells and replace them, leave us with our Life for a Life spells and be happy you did a good job on those two.<P>6) Defoliation: Uhm, hello? Seriously, you guys have to laugh.. someone put in a neat idea (hey, Necros are all about death, why not make them able to decay plantlife?) and then completely forgot about it. Why /wouldn't/ you make it work in the PoG? Why wouldn't you make it work on all the other plants? Too lazy to go around recoding mobs with a flag PLANT that lets them be hit by this spell? Nah, I don't think you guys are that mean.. I honestly just think that the team forgot about it and will leave it at that. Please pick back up egg with your spoon and carry it to the finish line on this topic and necros will be happy.<P>7) Track corpse: Haha, well, it took a year but ya got there. And to be honest, no necro cared 'that' much about this spell.. it was usually just something to throw in Verant's face (Hey, y'all STILL haven't fixed track corpse.. etc) We have Locate Corpse which is the exact same thing, only you click it yourself whenever you want to use it. Woooo, how did we ever go so long without Track Corpse doing it for us? Hehe.. it was good for a laugh, but from all the necros, thank you never the less for fixing it. We appreciate you doing that.<P>8) Epic Weapon: The look and effect are not well loved in the community. Uh.., that was the understatement of your career so far. First, yes, it would take a lot of time and effort for a graphic artist to go render us up a new weapon altogether (well, not 'that' much, but I understand why you don't wanna do it). We're not 'so' ticked about the Quackstaff as we are the stats. If it has good (or even on par with the other epic) stats, we wouldn't complain nearly as much. It's like someone looked at our epic, laughed at the look of it when it Quacked, and decided that two wrongs make a right by adding sub-par stats to it. We can do this two ways Absor, cause I don't want you or Verant to sneak out of this one: The first way...<P>1) Compared to other caster epics, the points total is under everyone else? Why? The +mana and +hp on the other caster epics equals 100. Ours equals 60. Whaa? Of all the classes that can use both mana and hp effectively, aren't we the best at using both? Give us the full 100 please, sheesh. The effect: Does any other class get a spell more powerful yet less group friendly than us? Mmm, arguably, no. Have necros given you guys a hundred different spells you could have used on the epic that would have made it more epic? Yes. Is our epic's effect eclipsed by one of the spells /we already get/? Yes! Geez, I get depressed every time I go over all that...<P>2) The second way, not comparing to other classes epics: (Cause, like Verant said, they're epic for our class, their not epic for everyone.)<BR>In the overall goal of making everyone group friendly at higher levels.. how does this almost pure-solo effect help us? Why would our guildmates and friends want to help us achieve our epic for this effect? The points.. even compared to other classes, if I only compare to other items in the game, they're too close. There's a staff out there that's caster useable who's effect is regen and who's stats are almost as great. Omg.. necros have already declared that item our epic weapon. So, what to do...<P>A) Change the stats to at least get on par with everyone else, don't be absurd in trying to say our class is so powerful we don't need as many points. <BR>B) Change our effect, period. Either Summon Corpse with no coffin at all (to compliment Clerics nicely on large raids) or a lifetap of some kind, dot, dd lifetap, or (Again, I hear the screams of other classes coming) a more powerful pet.<BR>C) If nothing else, at all, about our epic weapon.. make it a focus item. You've heard all the complaints about pets so far, you know we're having problems with them.. maybe this could 'start' and 'help' make up for their lacking. We'll work on them a bit more later though.<P>9) Lich series - You kinda have to take in the gut on this one, guys. The spell hasn't been working as it was originally intended since the beginning of the game, yet every mob created since then, every encounter, every quest made up since then, has been made up reflecting necros having this power at this level. If it were that overpowering, would there not have been a patch long, long ago? Would someone not have caught it a looong time ago and posted about it? (Either due to class envy, or simply honest people wanting to clarify it.) Absor, please, whatever you do.. don't let Verant tell us - Well, it's been better than what we originally intended, so THERE! We just gave you something! Because no, you didn't give us anything. It's been like that. We've dealt with it for better and for worse (ok, better mostly) this whole time. To change it now could EASILY (and your balancers should be able to tell you this) unbalance us so badly that you'd have to make an emergency patch within the week to change it back. Suddenly.. necros who used to be able to shoot a cleric with mana 5 times, can now only hit him 3? Uh oh.. that raid just failed and 30 people died when the last ten times it went perfectly. Wanna guess how well that would go over? Yeah, I know you know you guys have only a 1 percent chance of changing this spell to the way it used to be.. y'all just don't care that much, and rightly so. Two expansions have been built so far with the current power level of necros in mind. To change it's base (and our lich series is a big balance base to necros) so radically would be, well, bad.<P>10) Pets! I'm tired, I'm sorry, but this has been a long post and I'm sure you're all tired of reading it as well. Someone else please do pets for me? They're underpowered.. actually, their power is ok, it's their hp's. Come on Verant, you gave us uber mobs in Velious and yet our pets are still based off Kunark stuff. Rogue pet, neat, he can backstab if I'm solo'ing.. I just wasted what could have been an upgrade to my 49th pet for the ability to better solo. Mages, however, keep getting pets that simply increase in power overall. 56 Monk pet.. a kick, and more melee. Ok, he dishes out damage like a merely upgraded from 49th to 56th pet would dish out. But for that, I have to live with him having about half the hp's? Wait, if a mages pet goes from having (just an example here kids, get a statician to come lay down the numbers in here) XXX hit points at 49, to XXXX hit points at 56 while also getting the hitting power upgrade from 49 to 56.. why is it Necros get the hitting power upgraded, and the hp's not only NOT increased, but HALVED from what the lesser pet was? Ok, again, I waste 4 levels of having a solo'ing pet (not group friendly verant :P ), another 4 levels to get a pet that hits as hard as it should but has half the hp of my pet from 8 levels ago. Ok, if I can just hang out 3 more levels.. I can finally get my uber, end all be all pet. (Since unlike mages, we don't get an Epic that gives us something atop any spell we currently have, especially a spell as powerful as a pet) Spectre! Oh wait, spectre has a few neat abilities.. but, he's not really all that much of an upgrade. Some people claim a 49 pet can beat him.. well, I don't fully buy that myself, having never seen it first hand. I think sure, maybe 1 out of 10 times, something happens with bad rolls for the Spectre and he loses. But then again, a pet that's /10/ hell levels higher should NEVER lose. Has a 49th pet ever lost to a 39th pet? Have you ever seen someone on the board posting "Hey, I still have to use my 39th pet cause my 49th sucks!" Of course you haven't. Absor, recheck the spectre.. don't make it (obviously) as powerful as the mage epic, but could you maybe at least consider putting it on part with a mages 59 pet? Or, I dunno, ANY of their post 50 pets? Mages get a series of pets to choose from, we get either 49th pet for SoV encounters (sadly, laughable), or a pet that specializes in more damage through kiting (not exactly workable in all situations between 53 and 56, but we're expected to work around that I guess), or through somehow not aggroing a mob (cause a monk pet that aggros a mob is a waste of 2 bone chips). Look, if you wanna leave those variety pets, GREAT. They're neat. But /also/ give us a real upgraded 49th pet at 53 and 56, or put some in at like 51, 54, 57. And re-evaluate/balance that spectre. He isn't even close to the end all be all pet for our class that he should be.. more hp and or ac. He's our one defense.. don't tell us that mages can only say that cause we have spells. I've already shown that a number of our spells are 1) Never used due to EE's, or 2) Never used due to Nighttime only (which I've apparently forgotten about in this post), or 3) Non-allowed because of other factors (Ignite/Chill bones, Defoliate). Yeah, keep telling yourself we're not wrapped up with our pet when it comes to balance mages, we are. Granted, you guys are more so, but don't think we're just awesome casters period, oh, and we get a pet. Quick example, post 50 spells we can actually use on the average mob:<BR>51: Envenomed Bolt, Splurt. And envenomed bolt is used by Shamans, and isn't stackable, so it's limited if there's a shaman in the group.<BR>52: Plague<BR>53: Enstill (which is actually a DOWNGRADE of a spell we get at 49.. can any other class boast about that?)<BR>54: Deflux (our class saving spell at this level)<BR>55: Oops, none here save for Chill Bones which again, as pointed out we can't use sometimes because of meleer's range issues.<BR>56: Cessation of Cor<BR>57: Exile Undead (Every mob isn't undead, so again, limited use), Vexing Mordania (again, a class saving spell here)<BR>58: Immobilize (*blinks* Another downgrade? Is this a joke?), Pyrocuror (takes too long, a whole seperate exclusively with dots)<BR>59: Devouring Darkness (See, this is a spell that makes us laugh.. and then cry when we think of our Epic), Touch of Night (YES! Good spell)<BR>60: Banishment of Shadows (again, limited use as it's undead only and leaves no corpse.. players don't get amused by that fairly often), and.. uh, that's it.<BR>So we have what, an average of 1 or 2 spells per post 50 level we can use on mobs aside from pets? (granted, not counting velious spells)<BR>Don't EVER tell necros we aren't wrapped up in our pets balance wise kids, cause it just ain't true.<P>Well, I'm done.. if anyone else wants to finish up where I left off, feel free to go more indepth about our Nighttime only spells and our Pets. And come on guys, get some creative juices flowing for Verant, maybe they'll replace our 2 EE using spells with spells we can actually use.<P>Absor, Verant people, thank you for reading this post in it's entirety. Again, Absor specifically, thank you for actually starting a necro talk thread. Now, one last thing.. don't forget, if you don't post here anymore.. it's not really a discussion, is it?<P>-Ashtaroth<BR>Hopeless Necromantic, Legends, Innoruuk.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>If litch needs to be nerfed so be it. I loved my necro but the cold reality I can't play him the way I play him 99% of the time on raids (which encumpass 60% of my 58 shamans time) then its a useless class for ME.<P>I see a necro as damage. Not mana giving luvy dovey hug fest. Its not in character for me nor any necro IMHO. Necros are death and destruction. <P>Plus even with the mana pump, there is nothing to get it back from anyway. Your fear is on raids they could lifetap mobs and drain.<P>Clearly this woul mean you see lifetap exceeding the burn ability of wizards with the mana drain.<P>But you are going to fix the wizard line on ubers. You need to address wizards AND necros on raids at the same time. <P>Here is my take. Wizards should do about 1/3 more burn on boss mobs with litch taken into consideration for a whole mana bar. You have to compare with them using their mana spell also though.<P>Necros also have a pet but they arent going to be effective and only 4 pets can hit a mob. At least our guild has 3 mages and they get prefrence, especially after the new lines to make them perform better against boss mobs.<P>I don't think anyone here is asking for us to out perform wizards. I think we all feel they need a lure performance increase. Especially if it lets us use our lifetaps on boss mobs.<P>But after everything is taken into consideration nerf litch if you have to. Please make me have a reason to play my necro. he is currently 41 and I put him on ice to reluctanly make a cleric since all id be doing is pumping one anyway.<P>Balith 58 shaman<BR>Gurr 41 necro (on ice for now)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor and Zrazzt,<P>We currently get 32 for 32.<P>If the change occurs (if necromancers are improved) it becomes 48 for 32.<P>We run out of hit points sooner with less mana as a result.<P>Also all of the drain line will be less efficient.  We use the drain line in concert with the Lich line.  Necromancers will run out of hit points faster than they can restore them.<P>For the sake of argument, this change will hurt the solo ability of necromancers a great deal, maybe enough to actually make necromancers a full third less efficient at soloing.  <P>There we are not group friendly and less efficient at soloing.

</FONT><HR>Well, I'm only level 35, but I have ideas.<P>For the epic weapon effect, how about a variation of deathtouch (since we're the masters of death)?  Not an actual death touch, but an instantaneous variable damage nuke (may/may not hit for max) that has a 400 damage cap and a 5 minute recast time (so we won't chain cast it like the JBB or anger the wizzie gods).  Since this is an epic weapon, very few would have it anyway.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Ok first on my thoughts on the epic...<P>Please change the look.  We all know that many players go for items that are viewable, to "show off" so to speak.  I have heard too many comments on the necro Duck Staff, Staff of Duckness and Scythe of the Shadowed Ducks.  Even something simple would be nice.  I always liked the look of the Dark Reaver for SK's.  A basic 2h sword but with a black blade.  Perhaps a staff look similar to the tranquil canes or staff of waterwalker with a regular scythe blade but black.  <P>As for the effect I would still use Dooming Darkness over it.  Post 50 (the lvl the epic is intended for) darkness is not used for any dot component but for the snaring effect.  I would suggest taking out the dmg part but adding a snare, slow and debuff as the effect.  This way the mobs movement is slowed, attacks are slowed and it becomes more vulnerable to magic attacks.  Remember this is supposed to be "epic" and as it stands now nothing that epic about it.  The only other suitable effect I can think of is the Summon Corpse without using any coffins.<P>Now on to ignite/chill bones...<P>The effect is serves no purpose.  I'm sure when the spell was 1st cast way back when everyone was still new to EQ everyone was like "whoa!! it turned into a skely!" but now I don't bother.  Since the illusion doesn't do anything cept to show that no more IB/CB can stick the coolness factor has long since wore off.  Since getting Torbas Acid Blast with Velious, I don't even use it anymore.  Why?  I can chain cast Torbas and don't annoy the tanks with the illusion.  Another thing is the weird pathing that happens when you use it on a large mob (giant, clops, etc).  You have a 50 foot giant poofs into a 5 foot skely and is now "hopping" around.  Perhaps use the giant skeleton model for when large mobs are nuked with this?  If the illusion must be kept for whatever reason, at least make it look different than our pets.  <P>Big Raids and our role the Mana Battery...<P>Dots are probably never going to be allowed on a big raid.  No one wants to risk losing a very very rare drop to corpse poofing.  You can say "oh we fixed it so that won't happen" but NO ONE will allow me to cast a dot.  The risk is too great.<P>To make our usefulness better I suggest some spells that work ONLY in big raid situations.  Just like how some zones don't allow certain spells to be cast (DMF comes to mind), have it where there is a spell line that can ONLY work in the planes or VP.  The subversion line (the mana feed for those necro impaired *smile*), could have a Dimensional Subversion spell feeds 250 mana for 400 casting cost, but, only works in the planes or VP.  Since a large chunk of our spell line is useless in these raids (all dots), our nukes are pathetic (ignite/chill is sometimes banned by the guild so cannot be used), this would give us something to help make up for the deficiency.  Again this would balance out as the spell would not work in the "real world" only in planes or VP.<P>Comments on Defoliation...<P>Ok I have wondered how the "masters of death magic" get a plant DD.  I can't picture necromancers wanting to deforest the world.  At the level we get it there is no use for it.  Making fungus-type mobs and such being affected by this would be most helpful.  Just like when I was in lower guk, myself, clerics, etc could now have a more effective nuke vs undead.  Mages get the Hole to play around with their various summoned DD's plus some other kunark mobs that count as summoned creatures.  Not to mention in PoG is where Defoliation should be effective, but it isn't.  Either fix this or remove it as of now it's just taking up spellbook space.<P>Pets are fraidy cats...<P>I think pets should be immune to normal fear.  They are undead and as such shouldn't behave as normal pets.  If a mob has the ability to cast Spook the Dead or any such undead fear, well that is fine.  I have been forbidden to use my pet in many places due to the risk of the pet getting feared and running off to who knows where.  A balance could be struck that certain mobs only cast undead fear, thus making mage pets very useful and other mobs cast only normal fear thus making our pets useful.<P>Post 50 pets some thoughts...<P>I still use the 49 pet.  It has more hps than the rogue or monk pet.  The damage in straight up melee is about the same.  Only when the rogue pet can land a backstab or the monk pet kicks is there a higher damage output.  Problem is my rogue pet needs to be behind the mob to backstab and if I can get it to that point it doesn't land many of them.  I would like to see them replaced with a pet line similar to the mage summon monster ones.  I get a white skely til lvl 24, then get a dark skely til I get the spectre pet.  Keep the spectre pet as the final necro pet, but have the other 2 post 50 pets summon something other than a skeleton.  The would lose any rogue or monk abilities and be strictly warrior types.  A suggestion would be a mummy pet that instead of a lifetap proc has a disease proc and a ghoul pet that has a weakness effect.  I would be willing to have a gem be consumed in the casting, something around the cost of jasper, so that now I would have to carry around not only bones but gems as well.<P>Essence Emeralds (or soul gems as the slang goes)...<P>I think that the higher the player that is sacrificed the more gems you get.  The logic is that the gem traps the life force of the sacrificed and the higher the lvl of the player the stronger the life force.  Have it where if they under 51 one gem returned, 51 - 58 two gems, and 59 three gems.  This would certainately help out with those other spells that need the soul gem as the component.  Still keep the one emerald needed for the sacrifice, so in the above example if I sacrificed a 59 I have to have 3 emeralds on me or the spell won't work.  If this sounds too unbalancing (I do not think so), then allow the 39 cleric lesser xp rez to be allowed.  That way I get the gem but the person still gets a chance to get some xp back.<P>Other spell upgrades...<P>I would like to see an upgrade to the Screaming Terror spell.  I have found it to be somewhat useful.  Either when the chanter goes down or there isn't one I can be a back up mezzer.  It's not nearly as good as the chanter mez, doesn't last as long for one thing.  Either upgrade it to last longer or give us a AE Screaming Terror.<P>Make the Banshee Aura spell castable on others.  It would be nice if there is no druid or mage present for me to be able to throw a dmg shield on the tanks.  Still isn't nearly as good as the druid thorns or mage fire shield but would give us something xtra to offer a group.<P>Ok that's all I could think of as of now, I will post any other things I can think of.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Excellent! Thanks for starting the official talk Absor.<P>First off, Lich series. If the "bugged" 1:1 ratio is what is preventing Necros from gaining any sort of upgrades, then fix it. There are ways around it such as increasing HP gear and asking for Talisman and Symbol type buffs. Although personally, I think the spell is actually fine at a 1:1 ratio, seeing as I have thousands upon thousands of mana points versus my thousand HPs. So even at a 1:1 ratio, I will only gain 1300 mana for 1300 life, and that is about all of my life. heh heh But, if this is the one thing that is blocking any kind of fix to the class, then Id rather have it returned to normal. It may be a nerf of sorts, but it can be dealt with.<P>Lifetaps: I really dont see the harm in letting a 300+ damage lifetap, or even a 700+ damage lifetap land consistantly on the intended target. It is not a threat to Wizards in any way. The mana/damage ratio of these spells prevent any sort of overly powerful chain nuking, and really..the damage is not that incredible. Its meant to provide small damage, good healing. Im sure with todays technology, and the advancements in code since Beta and Release have allowed for some amazing things. Perhaps theres something in the programmers "bag-o-tricks" to allow these spells to work, yet still not allow 30 level 20s to tap a Sand Giant to death.<P>Mana transfer(subversion line): Ok, first off let me just say that as far as how *I* feel. Necros should have never gotten these spells. Altering the mind is an Enchanters thing. But, too late now, we got em, and we do use them...alot. I really dont mind being a manastone, infact it allows me to become rather close to alot of clerics, which leads to free rez heh heh, but if this is going to be our main role above all others from now on, let us be good at it. If 90 percent of our damage dealing spells are now resisted by demi-boss mobs in EQ Proper(ie:Nagafen, various Epic quest mobs), and most boss mobs in Kunark, and nearly everything above level 50 in Velious, then where is the balance? If we cannot do damage, we are relegated to sitting with the cleric and feeding mana to him. Ok, but look at it this way. The highest level spell in this line costs 400 mana to cast and gives 150 mana to the target. Now look at the casting time, I believe its roughly 2.5 to 3 seconds, and a recast of roughly 6 to 7 seconds(I dont have my list with me at the moment). So youre pumping mana at a 4:1.5 ratio every 8.5 to 10 seconds. This is very inefficient. More so than any other spell in the game. And this is basically our bread and butter on raid levels. My idea is to up the ratio first. 3:2, 2:1 whatever. As it stands now the ratio is way whacked. Secondly, casting time..eh..I could live with it, I think it would be nice if it were 2 seconds even. Recast...ugh..this one bites. You would never be able to transfer mana fast enough in an emergency situation. Decrease recast time to instant or somewhere around 2-3 seconds. <P>Ignite/Chill Bones: I have mixed feelings about this one. I think it should be either worked to be allowed on raids, meaning that the skele effect should be made scaleable, or give us 2 more spells after level 50 that have the same damage and time restriction effect but without the illusion. I dont wish to take anything away from lower level Necros who have yet to enjoy the spell, albeit its a brief enjoyment, its fun when you first get it. I think an alternative Ignite/Chill Bones spell given at the same levels(maybe make them questable, God knows Neriak needs some new quests..but not epic scale quests now), these would not add to the power of the Necromancer, infact they would be the exact same spells, just minus the skele illusion, and lower levels looking forward to the original spell wouldnt be robbed of the illusion forever.<P>Group additions: A group DMF isnt a bad idea really. Make it a 400 mana cost or something, but I dont see how this would make Necros more powerful and cause any kind of envy. It would just make what little buffing we can do a bit more efficient. Targetable Feign Death, this to me sounds pretty cool. Cleric is getting beat on bad by an overly aggro mob, Feign him. He still takes the same saves as anyone else who uses the spell, so its not a guarenteed escape. It does allow for a Necromancer to be more group desireable as well. This doesnt make the Necro too overly powerful as it is not doing extra damage to a target or healing for any ungodly amount. Its a simple roll of the dice hope it works escape spell, just like normal feign.<P>Pets: Oooh boy, where do I start? heh heh I know...everyone thinks Necro pets are THE supreme being in Norrath. But its kinda like the gun control debate. Look at the AK47. Its a mean looking gun that causes images of terrorists and mass death, but in reality a 30.06 will do much more damage than the AK47. Its the looks and the myth surrounding it that make it so menacing. So here you have a skeleton pet. It looks mean. All dark with green glowing eyes and gooey guts inside its ribcage. Scary lookin huh? But lets take a look at its weaknesses. It has hardly any defense skills at all, and what offensive skills it does have is quickly outmatched as the mob skill table climbs at a verticle pace. It has no resistances to any spells. Level 1 characters can land their spells on a 49 or 53 pet. Sure, they cant kill it, but the point is the pet sucks them up. The old dagger speed buff. Man I miss this ability, and yes it was an ability. It was never called a bug until AFTER they nerfed it. GZ and Abashi both said that buffing the pets speed with low delay weapons was something that the necromancers could do that other classes couldnt. I saw them make this statement many times. And then out of the blue its a bug. Also, I dont know if its just bad luck, or what but I have the worst time trying to get a high level 49 pet to summon. If I get a 55 hitter Im thrilled beyond belief and I wont let anyone do anything to it, infact Ive refused to destroy a 55 hitter when my group was wanting to move to a different spot. "Youll have to destory it, pathing in here is bad and it will cause trains, lets go".."Heck no! You know how few and far between these pets are? Next one I summon will probably be some whimpy green 47 hitter." heh heh silly I know, but I like to summon max level pets, and for a pet spell that is 3 levels below my current level, youd think max level pets would be more common. Pathing...eh..its bad in some places, but I can see where improvements have been mande is quite a few places.<P>Essence Emerald spells: Plainly put, the only essence emerald spell I would EVER use is the res spell Convergence. The willingness of players to just give up a full exp death with no chance of a res is low at best. And my bank account cannot support a large supply of these reagents as those very few players who are willing to eat the exp want around 1k per cast. With the way exp gains work post 50, its very unlikely to ever get someone in this level range to accept this kind of death. So youre best options are left with 46-49 level players. Seeing as 46 is the level after a hell level, loss of exp is increased, so you can forget about people that level. This leaves you with players level 47 to 49. 3 levels to work with, and what are the odds of finding a player that is level 47 to 49 AND willing to eat the exp loss AND not wanting a kings ransom for the trouble? Good luck. The lifetap and the mana gain spells requiring the emeralds...I'll never ever use them. Call me weak willed or whatever, but I cannot see costing someone a full exp death just so I can have 1000 mana. 1000 mana is maybe 1/3 of my mana bar. This might get me a couple more spells, or maybe a cast or two of a Subversion spell to the cleric. The 1000 point lifetap. Id rather cast two regular lifetaps, I get the same health returned and if a regular tap is resisted, Ive only wasted mana. If this essence emerald tap is resisted, Ive not only wasted mana, Ive wasted an emerald that could be used to res a cleric, Ive wasted the money and time it took me to get the emerald, and Ive wasted hours upon hours of another players time. I'll just never see a use for them, and unless a Necro is in a very large guild with twinks and mules galore that are willing to become his harvest of emeralds, no normal necro will ever use these spells either. Its too costly for such little gain. A different reagent would be better served for these two. <P>Epic weapon: I have nothing to add really. Im not even too motivated to try for it. If Im on a raid and I come across a pice for the quest..cool. If not, of well. Thats how much of an impact it makes on me. Rather than saying "Oh wow! I gotta get me one of those!" its more like "Oh..cool."<P>Im sure anything Ive missed will be covered later on. Again, thanks for starting the official thread Absor. I hope the lines of communication will remain open between our community and you on these issues.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The problem with Ignite Bones is actually quite the opposite of what you stated Alan. When the mob turns into a skeleton, the range which is its mellee range drops dramatically, often times you need to be standing flush against it. This is all from a melee class's point of view, and I've seen these skeletal versions of the mob run (or hop as they usually do) back over to the necro, and whipe him out. This may have something to do with spells he's casting, but I often times see this as the first course of action by a mob who's been turned into the skeleton. The larger the mob was originally, the worse the effect of the spell becomes. On raids this becomes an even worse spell effect, where before lets say 15 melee types could surround and beat on the mob, taunt, etc. now that number is reduced to 6 or 7. Even as a rogue, often standing alone or with one other rogue behind I have a hell of a time locating the target while I get spammed with "you cannot see your target you cannot see your target you...). While this is frustrating for melee types, it is many times death for a necro. Examples: Kael, everything is big, barring the dogs; Oggok, everything ogre sized or above seems to like to bounce about- not sure what size it should be; Skyshrine, Skyfire, Great Divide any place that has wurms or creatures with larger than average areas to attack within or be attacked within. Basically any large mob- I've seen it rare on occasion fora  necro to use this on a boss mob, as often times with these encounters you need things to go smoothly and this spell just brings utter chaos (what I'd like this spell to be called in its current form). <BR>   Now I dont play a necro, so I wont post on any other issues as I dont know what they like or dont like, but from a melee class standpoint I thought it was a valid point to put across as it deals with the unwelcomeness of necro's in groups/raids & with what they can do against boss mobs.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think returning the Lifetap series to it's unresistable state as it was previously would be the way to go. There would need to be a level range that this unresistability could work (say 6-8 levels difference). So a 59th level necro could life tap Trak or a 49th level necro could life tap venril. Between this and the fact that mana/damage ratio is so bad for this spell line, you shouldn't get the complaints that Wizards are being comparatively nerfed (wizzies can lure Trak at 52nd level).<P>This one change would give the necros an offensive capability against the Uber mobs of Norrath, and make them more raid worthy while at the same time not giving them any more advantage at lower levels or against different mobs.<P>With this change, I don't see the need to affect the lich line. If this line is deemed to be over powered (can't totally argue against this fact either) reduce the effectiveness of the lich line down to an enchanter's level appropriate clarity line (with health costs still in place of course). Reducing it more then this would be to alter one of the defining powers of a Necromancer which is mana regen.<P>Oh and yes, it took great will power not to ask for a stronger pet post 50  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Sincerely,<P>Panthandraxus, the Blight of Brell.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Overview of the Necromancer: How can we be improved?  <P>Disclaimer:  I do have a 51st Level Dark Elven Necro, so if I comment on spells/concerns that pertain to 52-60th level necromancers, I am using information drawn from both personal feelings and from information gleaned from www.eq.stratics.com as well as other sources.   Flames will be ignored.<P>Objectives:  to discuss Necromancer’s weaknesses and overall concerns.  <P>A few weeks ago I had a chance to go to the Plane of Fear for the first time, and I had a blast.  We cleared the plane and then went after Cazic himself.  A fellow necromancer volunteered to take the first Death Touch.  CT screamed out “Zarc!” and with that, my friend was dead.  Trembling the way that only a Plane n00b can tremble, I sent my pet in as my fellow guildmates charged in for the kill.  I stood back and waited until CT was down to about 75% health before I used my 49th level Drain Soul on him.  After having waited about a minute, I tapped him again knowing full well that Chain-Tapping a god was a good way to get killed.  When the fight was over, I had only cast twice, the CT lay dead, and we rejoiced.  <P>My next question would be, “What’s the matter with this?”  I was able to cast on a god, and I felt useful to both my party as well as to the raid as a whole.  I don’t feel that my ability to cast on a god was overpowered, and I had fun.  <P>Why is it that Verant feels the need to downgrade my ability to contribute to a raid?  Even if all of our lifetaps were 100% resistible (within the 6 level limit), this still does not give us an unfair advantage.  If you chain-cast any spell on a mob, you run the risk of having that mob turning its attention on you: chain-casting on a mob = angry mob = soon to be dead caster.  Period.  <BR>I understand that Verant does not want a group of 25 n00bie necros to chain-tap a Sand Giant to death, and I realize that doing so would violate the risk vs. reward idea.  Tenth level necros should not be able to gang up on deep red-con giants in Oasis and reap incredible experience/coinage with complete impunity.  /agree  <P>Why does Verant so fear a 57th necromancer’s ability to cast Vexing Mordinia upon an Epic Monster in Kunark/SoV? So what if a necromancer can lifetap a mob.  Verant is perfectly willing to allow that same necro to take part in a raid on Cazic Thule. That same Necromancer’s spell will stick to one of the Old World gods, why not all of the other mobs?  The level 57th necromancer has to play by the same rules as any other caster: chain-cast and run the risk of being killed.  Is Verant worried that any given 50+ necromancer will have an unfair advantage if he can affect one of the new 100,000 hit points mobs?  I have serious doubts that any given level 57th necromancer will have enough mana to chain-cast his<BR>459 mana/1000 hp leech/tap often enough to take down an Epic Mob, let alone any mob.  And even if the caster had enough mana to chain-cast his tap often enough to place a serious dent in one of the new supercharged epic mobs’ health, he will eventually earn the wrath of said mob: again, chain-casting on a mob = angry mob = soon to be dead caster.  <P>Overview of 50+ spells:  <P>Dread of Night: I really have not seen much of an improvement over my level 34th Invoke Fear.  Considering that we have to wait 17 levels for this upgrade, I would have hoped for a spell that either lasted longer or was resisted less.   Disappointing  <P>Envenomed Bolt and Splurt:  fantastic spells….I really like these dots.  <P>Sacrifice:  I am disappointed in this spell.  Seems to have limited usefulness.  If Essence Emeralds were random drops off of level 45+ mobs (like 50+ spells), then this spell would be much more marketable.  <P>Defoliation:  not enough actual “plant” mobs at 52+ to make this spell useful.  Why not make this spell a level 30 one instead?  <P>Manaskin:  a bit expensive (peridot as regent), but has potential.  <P>Plague:  nice, but takes 21 ticks to run its course…far too long.     Considering that most non-epic fights at 50+ last about a minute tops, most of this spell gets wasted.  <P>Scent of Terris: debuffs are nice, if you can get them to stick…seems to be resisted a lot.  <P>Annul Magic:  seems to be ok.  <P>Convergence:  a great spell, but considering the cost of the regent (Essence Emerald), underutilized.  Why not make Essence Emeralds drop as loot from random 45+ mobs?  See Sacrifice.  <P>Enstill:  a disappointing upgrade to root considering that the 49th level Paralyzing Earth has the potential to last twice as long.  <P><BR>Minion of Shadows: I think that most necromancers would have preferred just a regular upgrade to the 49th pet, Invoke Death.  I, for one, would set aside any fancy pet attacks for a simple an improvement to your garden-variety 49th pet.  <P>Deflux:  a very nice, fast acting lifetap…thank you, Verant.  <P>Shadowbound:  has potential in an emergency, but it’s not as if we have that much health to throw around.  <P>Shield of the Magi: very nice spell…thank you, Verant.  I just wish we could buff others with it, even if that buffing called for a regent.  Buffing others with this would go a long way in making us more group friendly.  <P>Thrall of Bones: has potential, but given the unstable duration of most charms, compounded by the fact that necromancers have such low charisma, it is not a spell that I would place much confidence in.  If we are supposed to be both social pariahs and the masters of undead, why start us off with a penalty (presuming that a naturally low charisma score hinders a necromancer’s ability to charm undead)?  <P>Chill Bones: forbidden on most raids.   Can you consider removing the illusion aspect of the spell?  <P>Infusion:   underutilized, considering the cost of the regent….see Convergence and Sacrifice.<P>Levant:  were it not for both the very long casting time and the fact that its use is limited to nighttime-only, it had the potential to be a very nice upgrade to Shadow Step.  Not one I would use to help out a group.  <P>Skin of the Shadow:  not sure about this spell…get back to me later.  <BR>Cessation of Cor:  this dot is simply hateful!  : )  nice damage/duration ratio, and considering that it is Disease-based, it will stack with both Envenomed Bolt (poison) and Splurt (magic based)…a must have spell. Thank you, Verant.  <P>Sedulous Subversion: I wish that the mana transfer ratios were higher, but I don’t think that this is going to happen.  So long as we can tap mobs to get our health back on raids, this spell can help out a cleric in a pinch.  <P>Servent of Bones: See Minion of Shadows.  <P>Trepidation:  seems like a weak upgrade to Invoke Fear…see Dread of Night.  <P>Conjure Corpse: excellent upgrade to the 39th level spell, it’s just a shame that we have to wait 18 levels to get it.  <P>Exile Undead: this spell only as a 2.9 mana to damage ratio.  As the masters of the undead, I would have hoped for a more powerful Undead DD spell.  <P>Vexing Mordinia:  nice spell…a must have.  <P>Immobilize:  seems like a downgrade from the 49th level Paralyzing Earth.  <P>Pyrocruor:  nice damage, but takes 18 ticks…a bit long for group/raid level fights.  <P>Quivering Veil of Xarn:  the nighttime-only restriction on this spell makes me want to continue with Harmshield.  This is very disappointing for a level 58th spell.  <P>Devouring Darkness: nice damage, but I wish the spell lasted upwards of 20 ticks and not it’s intended 13 ticks.  We tend to use the darkness line of spells for the snare effect and not for damage.  I would prefer a zero damage, 50+ tick snare spell to the current darkness line.  <P>Emissary of Thule: not sure about the statistics on this pet, but I would hope that it would be a nice upgrade to the 49th level pet with respect to AC and HP and attack damage.  Again, I would gladly give up fancy pets for your run-of-the-mill necromancer pet if that pet had an improvement to both the AC and the HP of the 49th pet.  <P>Touch of Night: a nice addition to the 49th and 54th level lifetaps.   <P>Banishment of Shadows: the cost of the regent seems to make this undead DD a bit expensive.  Why cast Banishment of Shadows when you can just cast Exile Undead several times?  <P>Demi Lich:  nice improvement to Lich.  <P>Enslave Death:  I like the idea of a fixed duration undead charm, but considering that the spell will only last 30 seconds, it  hardly seems worthwhile.  It’s not a spell I would pay for.  See Thrall of Bones.  <P>Trucidation:  nice lifetap, but does it require a regent (Essence Emerald)?  If so, see Sacrifice.  <P>Wish List:  <BR>I wouldn’t mind seeing an upgrade to Shadow Vortex.  At 51st, I still use that when I am in a group.  I can tap every mob for a 40 AC debuff and help out the tanks.  Why not a 50+ upgrade to this spell? Better yet, why not a group Shadow Vortex that takes AC from the mob and gives AC to every member of your group?  It wouldn’t have to last any longer than the level 20 Shadow Vortex, and it would make us more group friendly.  <P>Oh well, just my 2 cp.<P>Nanaelil D’Vorn<BR>51st Necromancer<BR>Fallen Wolves<BR>The Nameless <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055864-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055864.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055864-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055864-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055864-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055864-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055864&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055864&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
