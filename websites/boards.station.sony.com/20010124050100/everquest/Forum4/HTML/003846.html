</FONT><HR> I know it would be a lot of work to put together, and may be an expansion in itself. but i think we should be able to buy and trade horses to ride, which would make you go faster. There could be different types, and places to stable them. Wherever you stabled them last would be where they would pop up when they died, or when you died. if only the horse died you would have to go back to the last stable point to get it. Might be stretching it, but i think the ability to name them would be cool too. Also, instead of just horses there could be other more expensive things to ride, such as dragons, unicorns, or dolphins for water riding. This would definately make the game a lot cooler, hope you think it over  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This could be a whole new class for that matter.  Make an animal trainer class that could sell the trained animals to people.  You could have several "pets" trained and follow you and simply give them a command such as:<BR>/transfer &lt;pet name&gt; &lt;new owner name&gt;<P>Make this class fairly weak on hp and ac but allow them to tell their pet's to attack.  <P>the number of pets they could maintain at one time as well as the type of animal/mob they could tame would also be dependant on their lvl.<P>There are probably a lot of details left out of this but this seems like a very cool start to a new class.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think it would greatly benefit Verant to listen to this line of thinking. no telling how many more people would want to play if they knew they would eventually be able to ride dragons.

</FONT><HR>All these ideas are starting to get me going. Been playing a while and one of the things I hate the worst is trying to get a port to another zone. Let's face it, unless your a high level, you really can't explore much of the world without a lot of deaths and CRs. It would be nice to be able to ride with caravans and such for a price to get to a new zone. At least it would add more diversity to lower players, and of course at higher lvls gain the ability to ride creatures. This could be a skill or new class. Doesn't matter. I just hate staying in one area till I build up enough pp to get a port to a new area, and not knowing if I can really handle it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree, this would be great.<P>However I think they will complain about the fact that this would increase the number of "things" walking around in a zone, which some zones just cant handle.<P>But if they could, they should also consider "Blank Shields" (mercenaries), that are "pets" for melee classes - the more exp ones being more expensive.

</FONT><HR>I read (something, can't remember what, magazine article I think?) a Verant representative asked if they would ever consider entering ridden creatures into the game, and the answer was an emphatic, absolute, non-changing<P>no.<P>I suppose it raises way too many issues.  Where can the animal go and what can it do?  What happens if that bear you're riding goes into the water?  Can you take an animal into town?  Into buildings?  What are the modifications to battle damage and defense?  Does the animal get hit too?  Can it fight back?  How long can a person keep an animal?  Is it like food, it'll go away?<P>See, in Norrath, people giving quests out have been standing in the SAME SPOT for two years.<P>Creatures and current modes of transportation are on a SET PATH at all times.  (the boats have the highest percentage of bugs, and they're on a set path!)<P>The world is STATIC, not DYNAMIC.  You can't carve your initials into a wall, you can't knock a door off it's hinges, you can't "fly", only levitate a bit.  There are no creatures flying around in the skies at all, in fact.<P>A renegade meteor does not smash into Norrath ever, the Orcs of Crushbone do NOT get any closer to taking over Kelethin (they might as well give up, they've been there for two years, just sitting there... waiting)...<P>See, it's like an amusement park.  Everything's on tracks.  On runners.  <P>I'm not trying to be the doomsayer or the big spoilsport or the nasty cynic.  I WANT all of these things too, BADLY (check out the thread on "Will Fironia Vie ever be completed?" - it's where this particuar conversation is going on bigtime)... but the reality of it all is this:<P>until Verant decides to change the game from STATIC to DYNAMIC (involving MUCHO $$$ &lt;they have it&gt;, MUCHO PATCHING &lt;they can do it, even though YOU will complain big time&gt;, and MUCHO TALENT AND CREATIVITY &lt;well, we shall see!&gt;, it ain't gonna happen.<P>But it's a lovely idea!<P>Leafbringer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>oh as for the issue of the animal being on a set path and static vs dynamic, i think that that could be addressed by looking at the way the boats are controlled in the game. i mean the little row boats like the one near the specs in oasis. simply mount, right click and away you go. when you are dismounted, control is given back to AI of the animal, accepting commands like a normal pet and such. <BR>any feedback on this would be appreciated.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The main reason Verant has said that 'riding animals' is (you should pardon the expression) a dead horse in EQ is that it would require all new animations of all the characters while riding.<P>Masses of updates to the global files, and not allowed because of the limited texture memory of the 'base' system specs.<P>Velious Armor textures are excess, but also switchable, and can be turned off if you still have an old card, without making viewing the other players impossible.<P>There are, of course, all the other problems... What does it do while you go into a dungeon?  Poof?  Stand around and get killed by that wandering cyclops?  Get stolen by someone else?<P>Picture all the whining crybabys petitioning about 'so and so stole my horse, make him give it back!'...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What would be wrong with making a horse like an equippable item.  I know this sounds strange but I don't understand why it would not work.  You could zone with it. You wouldn't have to worry about it being stolen.  The only limitation would be to unequip it when entering a dungeon, city, or house.  In which case you could have added a hitching post (kind of like a bank, so no one can mess with your horse) to leave it outside until your ready to ride again.  Would this be so hard?  It doesn't seem like it would be. It might not be as realistic as real life but we are talking about a game.  And if it's a problem don't allow it to affect combat.  And of course they could come in different sizes to accomodate any race or class.  Yet they should be difficult to acquire (very expensive).  What's the big deal?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One thing I see out of this. You add a horse, wolf or whatever for transportation, you know what comes next? Paladins wanting lances so they can charge things while mounted. I really don't think it's needed, the only long travel times are waiting on the boats to show up and it won't help that. Even Qeynos to Freeport doesn't take that long when hiking, hire a bard if you're in a hurry. Other thing is this lowers the value of the bard and their ability to get people places quickly.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Silvorn, it's not like the bards couldn't use their songs to speed up the horses, they'd still be quite useful.

</FONT><HR>First, Silvorn, I think you're missing the point.  Horses wouldn't be just for Paladins.  Not only that, but even if they did implement lances (which I think we're getting a little ahead of ourself, they'll probably never add horses anyway), the use of such a weapon could be solely based on the Paladin's ability to use it, having nothing to do with the horse.  Second, It should be something for higher level characters anyway, so it should take absolutely nothing away from the importance of Bards because lower level characters (i.e. 1-40) are still dependant on old methods of travel.  Third, who has got 1 1/2 hour to kill just running from Freeport to Qeynos? I know because I've done it (this is assuming that you don't get attacked and killed along the way, in which case you could probably double that time).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This thread brings back memories of when people where excited about getting clockworks put in the game for tinkerers.  Nothing was done, don't get your hopes up.  They use this tread mostly for future titles (Everquest 2, that Star Wars game, etc)  They just don't want to spend the time it would take to add things like that.  Mainly because it would take about a year to complete it and by then who knows if Everquest will still be this strong (remember Shadowsbane, Anarchy Online, and Ultima Online 2 are right around the corner).  I would guess that most of Verrants developers are currently working on the Star Wars game or on Everquest 2.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
