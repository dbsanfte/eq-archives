</FONT><HR>Trayler is still a jerk, and no he isnt getting in groups.  Instead he is farming low level stuff and KSing from lowbies.  I know because I was once such a lowbie.  During her crushbone days my Wood Elf druid had worked her way up to the throne room in crush when one day we ran afoul of Trayler.  (He was not anon and not in a guild I think.)  This was about two weeks ago.  He was 35 and "camping" lego pads.  We we're willing to share the room with him, and told him that in general noone had exclusive camping rights to the throne room.  He ignored us, KSed everything (at thirtyfive legos fell in one or two blows) and I petitioned him.  Trayler told us we could kill legos "As long as you give me all the pads."  Naturally we told him to f**k-off.  A guide showed up, told him to cut it out, and he did for five minutes.  Then he started right up again.  I sent a tell back to the friendly guide (can't remember his name) and he returned with five GMs!  They all appeared out of nowhere and told Trayler to stop it.  I guess he did, but at that point he had already ruined my night and I logged about 1/2 hour later.  He is every bit the horsesass people say he is.<P>Why doesn't someone email this thread to Custromer Service?  I think it is long past the time Trayler was banned, if after all a whole thread is dedicated to his misdeeds.<P>Qiwi<BR>15-days without a Trayler sighting and counting.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If 5 GM's showed up, then he's probably on double, secret probation (I love Animal House).  I'm sure he got a warning or two that night.  There's probably a guide flagged to follow him around, whenever his account goes active, either as Trayler or as his alternate Nenten.  I'm just surprised with all this crap that he is still in the game.  I would've thought the game would get boring by now constantly being yelled at by people and warned by GM's.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm glad I stopped by this thread on a whim.<P>Phelan, i'd have to say your one of the rudest individuals I've met in this game.  I'm not trying to flame you here, and you can state whatever you wish about me, it won't bother me a bit.  But for you to walk in here saying bad things about my guild leader is just unacceptable.  Binxs is a good and honorable person, and nothing he said in here 'sanctions' any of the behaviours you've noticed in jihahd.  I won't defend him, because frankly I don't know him all that well, nor do I know even from him what happened there.  What I *DO* know is that your making rude and debasing comments about my guild leader which I will *not* put up with.<P>I feel bad for anyone who gets taken advantage of by other players, even if it's a member of my guild, but I'm not going to stand by while you insult members of my guild simply because they wanted to give moral support for someone whom they've never seen poor behaviour of in relation to other players in-game.  If you have a legimate claim of Jihahd's behaviour, bring all the people who were present to view what happened before binxs and jihahd (if vaalik was there to view it (not present in the zone, ACTUALLY there) then he should attend as well, and all of you CALMLY discuss what happened.  Flames will get you nowhere.<P>But if I see another baseless flame on the part of any of my guild members, I'll find out who YOUR guild leader is, and call you into accounting for YOUR poor behaviour.  And if your guild leader acts like your just an angel, and I'm some punk, then I'll just have to ensure that I and anyone I know avoids you and your guild.  People like yourselves who walk around giving others a bad name make me sick.<P>-Desbarolis -- 35th bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Desbarolis:  Did you read binxs' comments?  He justified someone's behaviour in training another, solely on whether the other had been "rude" previously to the trainer.  Is that acceptable?  He stated that if Jihahd acted the way I described, then there was nothing wrong with his actions.  Even though the training was into groups I was a part of, not just into me alone (which still wouldn't be justified).  Further, my only contact with Jihahd was after each of the three training/KSing incidents.  And they were months apart.<P>How did I insult either Jihahd or binxs by simply stating what took place or what was said?  If they were insulted, it was by their conduct.<P>Sorry, Vaalik wasn't around when Jihahd's actions took place, although he claimed to be in guildchat.  And I don't remember any members of those pickup groups as it's been a long time now, except for Jaeden from the first one.<P>So let me get this straight, I'm rude because I provide a warning about someone elses bad conduct?  And when his fans come in to defend this guy by bashing me, I defend the comments?  How is that rude?  <P>Look, it's up to you to take my testimony and do with it what you will.  Print it out, spit on it, and toss it in the trash for all I care.  I've just provided the story.  If you guys want to continue to let this guy sully your name, have a good time.  I think you are making a mistake.<P>And Des.  You've never met me in the game, although I have seen you around, so your opinion regarding my conduct therein is meaningless.  To say "your (sic) one of the rudest individual I've met in this game," followed by "I'm not trying to flame you," is hysterical in its hypocricy.  <P>My guild is the Sentries of Faith.

</FONT><HR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>Hey all you good people out there. I have died many times with people pulling through me or my group in FM and i have found the only time that it happens on purpose is if i or a member of my group sends tells or shouts rudely to the person who did it.  I dont blame them for it either. Most of the time it is accidental and they are sorry even if they dont say it right away<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>::snip::<P>That's the first part of this message.  He's stating experiences that have happened to himself, so that has nothing to do with 'sanctioning' poor behaviour.  If it does, please let me know how I'm mistaken.<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>All you need to do is be kind to them and they will go out of there way to be nice back. Seems to me the poster above has a short fuse and talks crap then people do react badly. Its human nature.<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>::snip::<P>His opinions of what your intentions/thoughts were, yet I see nothing of justifications there.<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>Some of my best friends once trained something on me in the past. I know two of the people from above and seen nothing but help and good things from both although they are human and do make mistakes im sure.<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>::snip::<P>Moral support.  So where is it he justified Jihahd's specific actions?  I saw him say what HE has experienced in FM at the fort, and possible reasons for what Jihahd did.  But so far we haven't heard anything but that Jihahd was indignant, from yourself.  I've not heard of him being outright rude, or anything of that nature.  <P>Now Rinbil on the other hand has been accused many times in the past of training people, KSing, and doing all sorts of other nasty things.  The latest thing I've heard about him is that he used to be in our guild, and promised all kinds of nice equipment to people if they'd powerlevel him, then never paid up on it.  He's since been removed from the guild, and has basically been blacklisted with us.  From the sound of it, these three were grouped together, and it could possibly have been bad circumstances for Jihahd.  I don't know, and to tell you the truth, I'm not all that concerned about that.  It's between you, Jihahd, and Binxs; and frankly doesn't belong on these message boards.  I personally think you could have handled it a lot better than that.  If ever I have problems that can't be resolved, or feel something needs to be done about another player, I attempt to get in touch with their guild leader and let them know of the circumstances surrounding the problem.  If Jihahd had been participating purposefully in wrongfull behaviour, I'm sure it would have been dealt with in a proper manner.<P>As far as my statement of you being a rude individual, and then saying I'm not trying to flame you, I don't see how me stating what my opinion of you so far is as a flame.  Flame's usually involve someone name-calling (swear words, insults, and the like).  Personal opinions of character are another matter.  You asked how I see you as being rude, I think that taking what another person says out of context, and stating that they sanction something that isn't good behaviour is rude (when I know for a fact that it's not true.  If anything, binxs is a very quiet, and likeable person), and deserves an apology.  You may not see it that way, and for that I can do nothing.  However I'm not going to stand by while someone insults my guild leader because he wanted to give moral support for someone.<P>-Desbarolis -- 35th bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Matter of opinion I guess.  However, he states training is not blameworthy if you've been rude to the person.  This is an error.  As he is stating it in response to my deeming Jihahd and anti-social jerk, it certainly appears to be justifying the behaviour.  Why mention it at all, if not as a defense and justification.  I love how he says, "that it happens on purpose is if i or a member of my group sends tells or shouts rudely to the person who did it."  Sure sounds like a justification to me.<P>"Most of the time it is accidental and they are sorry even if they dont say it right away."  That's also priceless.  Jihahd has never said he was sorry, and keeps playing the poor wronged player.  That's crap.  His conduct was intentional, and repeated.  Each of the incidents I've described were multiple trains on each of the three occasions I've had the misfortune to run into him.<P>The first time Jihahd acted thusly, was while he was a member of Sanguine Psyche Fellowship, the same guild as Trayler.  The second and third times, he was alone.  SPF did nothing about him the first time, so I brought it to this board.<P>How can binxs give moral support without having any knowledge of the events?  How can his comments describing circumstances of acceptable, intentional traing in response to alleged rude behaviour, not be considered sanctioning of the conduct?<P>I've accused three persons of bad behaviour in this thread.  Rinbil, Trayler and Jihahd.  You've admitted my analysis of Rinbil's conduct is accurate.  MANY others have said the same about Trayler.  Do you think it's possible that I haven't jumped to a conclusion about Jihahd?  If you've read the "cause and effect" thread I started, you can see I don't throw names around without just cause.<P>The fact remains that Jihahd trained and KS'd from my groups, for no justifiable reason.  I doubt any of them were specfically targeted at me, for I doubt he even knew who I was.  He still determined to train a bad pull through the middle of a group he knew was present at the location.<P>I think you need to reread the board rules on what is a "flame".  Personal attacks, are considered flames.  Calling someone rude is a flame.  At the very least it is an ad hominem attack that is only designed to cast dispersions upon me, and thereby try and bias my statements.  It's also pretty silly when you've never met the person, and my comments on this board hardly qualify.<P>If I've misjudged binxs' comments, I'm sorry.  I can't see how he's not trying to justify Jihahd's comments.  Perhaps if he came back to the thread to explain what he meant, it might help.  As it stands, it looks like he's justifying intentional training in order to escape a bad pull (not to mention the KSing that took place during my first encounter with he and Rinbil).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I already explained why I said I think he's rude.  If your friend was accused of steeling, and you weren't there to see what happened, there was no video tape of it and all you had to go by was eye witness accounts of him doing it, from people you didn't know, your telling me you wouldn't give your friend moral support?  That's the case here, Binxs wasn't there to see what happened, he only has an eye witness account from yourself stating what happened.  If I told Abashi I think he's rude, he'd want to know why, if I told him he was a jerk, I'd prawly get a warning or banned.<P>As I said before, it doesn't belong here, until you've exhausted other means of dealing with the situation.  If he has had problems with anti-social behaviour in the past in another guild, perhaps you need to speak to him and Binxs (at the same time, in person) about it to get it resolved.  Having other's present who were NOT there to witness it will not help the situation.  Having the guild leader of SPF there may not be a bad idea, but I dunnno, it's not up to me, I'm defending Binxs and the name of my guild.  Since I wasn't there to witness it, I can't rightly justify any actions of jihahd's.<P>You said he was alone at the time (I'm assuming you mean unguilded), which would have been quite awhile ago.  I've been in this guild for about 2 1/2 months, and Jihahd's been there as long as I can remember.  It may be that Jihahd and Binxs (or Sail, our previous leader) have had a talk about this already.  Again, none of my business.<P>However, what IS my business is you stating that my guild leader, even my guild supports those kinds of actions.  Not many people read these boards, that's not entirely what I'm worried about.  What I am worried about is the types of things you run around saying to members of your guild, friends in other guilds, etc, about our guild.  As a bard, I have an interesting time enough as is trying to find a decent group without people thinking 'Aurora Infinitum ... aren't they the one's with that KSing Ranger?  Eww, and a bard to boot ...' (even though I'd spank 'em in a duel &lt;grin&gt; )<P>Anyways, as I said earlier, my experience with you so far says your 'not very polite', if that's better.  I'm not saying I'm a boquet of roses here, but I already knew that.  Maybe if/when I ever have an opportunity to meet you in-game, or under other circumstances my opinion might change, but we'll see.<P>Anyways, I'd really appreciate it, and I'm fairly certain that the rest of our guild would as well, if you'd drop the discussion here and speak directly with Binxs to resolve this issue.  Spreading harmfull information about others without trying to deal through the proper methods can be very damaging.<P>-Desbarolis -- 36th bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>When I said Jihahd was alone, I meant that there was no one else with him.  He was a member of your guild the third time, I don't recall his status the second time.  The point is, that I've seen Jihahd three times at the Fort, and all three times he has KS'd, trained other groups in order to escape a bad pull, and generally been anti-social and rude.  None of you were there, so cannot say anything about the situation.<P>I've tried to resolve this dispute with Jihahd and his original guild.  After each of the three events I spoke to Jihahd and he blew me off.  I spent a month trying to get in touch with the guild leader of SPF before I ever mentioned his name on this board, and was unsuccessful.  Once Binxs identified himself on this board, I placed him on my /friend list in order to speak to him in game.  I've never seen him online.<P>And what's it gonna resolve if I speak to Binxs anyway?  I know what happened.  Jihahd has apparently lied to y'all about what occurred.  So what will be accomplished?  There is no way to resolve the dispute, as far as I'm concerned.  I've brought it up with Jihahd, and he's denied any wrongdoing and refused to apologize to those he affected.  The second event caused the death of one of my group members.<P>I'm here to simply warn the rest of the server about him.  You and Binxs' comments stand on their own in this regard.<P>As for my analysis of Binxs' statements, they are what they are.  As my comments are not in a vacuum, Binxs' post is there for all to read, whomever chooses to read the post can make their own determination of whether he is sanctioning training in response to allegedly rude comments.  I think it is clear that he is, while you disagree.  Others can do the same.<P>As I've stated, I will continue to respond to your comments and correct your statements, but I have no interest in continuing any sort of jihad against Jihahd.  At least until he does something else that is a violation of gameplay, I am quite happy to leave this be.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Based on the other stupid questions he asked in Guk later that day, I gotta believe him.  I doubt the real Trayler was smart enough to come up with a consistent disguise for his conduct.

I can completely understand where you feel that giving a warning to others is appropriate, HOWEVER, how many times are you going to warn people? Two pages isn't sufficient? The fact that you have this person on your /friends list and use it to monitor his comings and goings is, to me, excessive. Others have had bad experiences too, proving your point that this Trayler person is the sneaky, underhanded cad you warned them about? Well, doesn't it feel good to be right? <P>And lastly - feel free to send me a tell in game, as my name is posted clearly along with both my posts. I'll be more than happy to put you on /ignore and completely forget about you.

</FONT><HR>Fritti:  Wow!  Aren't you silly.  I understand what a grudge is.  My actions toward Trayler clearly do not qualify.  Let me explain it to you in smaller words so that you might not get confused this time.<P>I am an officer in my guild.  One of my duties is to keep an eye on problem players and warn the guild when they are around.  Trayler is one of these.  He has trained others in the past, and KS'd.  As a druid that primarily solo's, and having spent time on a Zek, I like to keep an eye out for such individual's.  Having him on my /friend list is the best way of doing that.<P>I haven't kept his name on this board repeating the tale over and over.  I mentioned him once.  Others have reported his conduct, and I've responded.  I've bumped this a couple times when there hasn't been activity in it, when I felt that it was necessary to keep the information available.  If you've noticed, I've added a few other grief players to this thread rather than starting new ones.  This isn't all about Trayler.<P>This isn't about the importance of being right.  Although I would be upset if I just got this guy on a bad night, which I avoided by doing some research on him before I posted my warning, the response of others demonstrates that I wasn't.  I'm sorry if you are so petty that being right about someone else's bad conduct would make you feel good, but I am not.  This isn't about me, it's about him.<P>I'm happy for you that you have your game name as your handle.  If you read the posts on this board, you'll find that this is not the case with most.  Your childish sarcasm is quite unbecoming.<P>And you've completely missed the point.  You've agreed with me that warnings are valuable, and that a players conduct ought to have repercussions.  This is one means of spreading a persons reputation so that these bad players "will suffer by their actions later."  I hope you use it like others have and avoid Trayler.<P>See ya.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>HaVoc:  Why give him a 15th chance to screw someone?  He's KS'd so many people, and cheated others, and stolen from his own guildmates.  There is no reason to trust him or give him another chance to loot someone.  I'm sure he's aching for another chance, because he's finding it hard to screw others with his current reputation.  Maybe he's nice to you because he's your friend.  That is NOT the way he treats anyone else.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wildcat:  You truly puzzle me.  How is it not my business when someone screws me and other players that I am friendly with?  I'm not telling him how to play the game, it's his choice to be an anti-social bottom-dweller.  I haven't forced him to be that way.  I didn't force him to KS, train, steal or defraud anyone.  He chose that path.  I'm just making sure that others learn of the choices he has made.  You've agreed that he deserves what his reputation has earned him.  I'm just insuring that others learn of his reputation.<P>Unfortunately, he appears to be following me around now.  Hadn't seen him in months, actually since the day after he defrauded me, and now nearly every time I'm on, there he is.  He's even tried to group with me a few times, the foolish little boy.<P>Raedwulf Typhoonbrewer<BR>L38 Halfling Drunk ... err ...

</FONT><HR>Heyas folks,<BR>Yeah Phelan, finally had my first chance to see Trayler up close this morning.  He was asking for a bind and a sow, i was at the bank in fv waiting for a person i was gonna tp.  After reading this thread for two months now, to say i would never help this person is putting it too nicely.  I am not totally sure if he was asking me since i was medding, but i ran to the far side of the city and waited to hear from my traveler before going back and then immediately jetting out of there.  Its people like this that would make it easy to want to stop playing EQ, and since i am not gonna do that yet, i will just avoid them all together.  Hope everyone has a great Thanksgiving and lets hope that everything (and everyone) will come out in the wash!   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>More fun with Rinbil:<P>This guy trained Sgt. Slate and two other guards into the tunnel to SRo yesterday.  He was SoWed and outrunning them, and easily could have made it to FP or WC.  Instead, he trains them into the tunnel.  To add insult to injury, instead of training them to the zone so that people could get out of the way when they inevitably returned, he ran around in the front of the tunnel, where all the dark races hang out selling their wares.<P>He caught hell from the zone for it, and never responded.  After a few L50's finally took them out, he just calmly went back to auctioning his yellow Fine Plate.  Oddly, in the two hours I was hunting up some items and filling orders for backpacks, he never got a taker, and eventually dropped his price by a bunch.<P>Some people never learn.<P>Raedwulf Typhoonbrewer<BR>L40 Halfling Drunk<BR>Sentries of Faith</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I must admit, as a level 9 Monk, I am not really all that powerful.  I was fighting in EC a giant scarab, and was taking a beating for some reason.  I only noticed the blurring effect after a little while.  Realising my health was on low and there were TWO scarabs just in one area (multidimensional insects, bizarre) and then of course a couple of lions joined in just for a laugh.<P>I legged it up over the dunes and headed straight for the tunnel, shouting forewarnings on the way.  Just about everyone in that tunnel was of a high enough level, so wasn't too worried.  I finished off the beatles myself with a little help from a Clerics major heal spell.  <P>I suppose the point is that at those levels, the mini train was more of a diversion to the players, but though I have never rumbled with Slate (and don't want to), I do know his strength.  If you cause a train, and it's bad in its combined strength, a player has two choices.  Run for zone or Run for Aid.<P>I suppose it all comes down to how you would deal with that situation.  Live or Die.  Now, how many of us can say they would stop and die rather than sacrifice themselves for the good.  In a panic we all do things to try and stay alive.  I am in NO WAY condoning the Uber Train thing, but if Sowed, there should be no excuses.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum18/HTML/000002-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum18/HTML/000002.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum18/HTML/000002-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum18/HTML/000002-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum18&number=18&thisthread=000002&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum18&number=18&thisthread=000002&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
