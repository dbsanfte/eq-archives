</FONT><HR>A more advanced spell and outdoor only dragon form where the wiz can becom a transparent ghostly dragon to fly around and recon. The wiz can't cast or hurt anything as a dragon, recon only. However, while he's transparent he's melee resistant and can only be damaged by magic. When his dragon form becomes solid he's damageable by melee and magic and no longer semi-invisible. When the wizard cancels dragon form he's completely weak and manaless with resurrection effects. If he dies in dragon mode by magic his bod returns to his bind point with all stuff on it, if dies by melee his bod drops where it dies.<P>Anyone like?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>An issue actually relating to Balance:<P>Wizards are unwanted in exp groups because they slow the group down.  (Specialized AoE maniacs - yes it rocks but it takes a special group, and that special group has strict class requirements which exclude most of the classes in EQ).<P>The fastest way to gain exp in Everquest is with the following group composition:<P>1-4:  Melee class.  4 rogues is a shredder.  4 monks/warriors - awesome *sustained* damage output.  4 hybrids works too.  3 mage/necro pets and someone to pull works great too.<P>5-6:  Pick any two of : enchanter/cleric/shaman/druid.<P>An exp group in everquest is a constant stream of blues that the group can take down quickly.  The limited sustained damage output of a wizard makes them a hindrance to a group with enough mobs to pull - they will get better exp with a different class.  A wizard contributes nothing to a group but damage.  Evac is great, but that is more of an exp-loss mitigator rather than a direct contribution to the exp rate.<P>Wizards are good in groups when:<P>a) the mob rate is fairly slow, so they have time enough to med back mana spent between pulls<P>b) the mobs are casters, and this only after level 20 when wizards get their first stun<P><BR>Wizards are moderately useful in raids.  They scale well, since all of their damage spells "stack", but with many/most of the new high-end encounters the mob has so many HP's, or has resistances of such high level, that the contribution of the wizard is meager at best.<P>The obvious way to increase wizard damage over time is to give them a med bonus.  Either give them higher skill caps and advancement rates, or increase Med effectiveness for wizards.  Wizards have no way to regain mana other than Meditate.<P>Some of the proposed suggestions for disciplines are promising as well - disciplines to lower cast time, lower resistance, increase damage, etc.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt; Sure, there is ONE Manna Robe known to have been dropped on RN, which I hardly call balance. Where is the gear, or the ability that helps the Wizard class with their only cause of downtime?<P>There's more than one Manna Robe on RN.  But perhaps you're imagining that it's actually a useful item to have.  Sorry, the three second cast on it makes it "good" for getting 20 mana every minute or so, and that's if you're watching your health all the time so you know when it's time to sap another 60 hp.  20 mana every minute.. It's not something you add to your "/ooc Wizard seeks group", I promise you.<P>&gt; Wizards, pre-Velious, could do a significant amount of damage in a rather short period of time to a monster with 32k HP. Ice Comet -- with no resists -- is 3.5% of a monster's life.<BR>&gt; That same nuke -- again, with no resists -- is 0.11% of a Thrifling Focuser's (sp? The trees in PoG with 1,000,000 HP) HP total.<P>You're outlining a problem that Verant cannot fix, unfortunately.  For mobs with excessive hps, Wizards will NEVER be able to fulfill the pipe dream of "fast damage".  In cases like this, and even lesser and far more common cases where the average mob has 15,000+ hp (most of SoV), it's a far better solution to allow Wizards to *gasp* do reasonable damage over time.<P>Verant, Absor, see any problems with that?  Wizards don't offer anything else to your typical grinding group or raid besides nuking.  Ports?  Ports fall into the same category as unlocking doors, casting invis vs undead on the party, CoH'ing everyone to a spot, etc.  They're the "getting there" part and have nothing to do with the "now we're here" part.<P>Fortunately, Rogues can offer more than just unlocking doors.  They do the most damage over time of any class in the game.<P>Fortunately, Magicians can offer more than just unlocking doors.  Their pet gives them superb damage over time and their nukes just add to the total, and they can debuff and provide damage shields.<P>Fortunately, Warriors can offer more than just tanking.  Their melee does damage over time similar to, if not quite the equal of Rogues.<P>Fortunately, Monks can offer more than just mob separating capability.  Their melee power lies somewhere between the similarly powerful Warrior and Rogue.<P>Unfortunately, Wizards have only their nukes.  Similarly unfortunately, Wizard nukes at their typical efficiency, namely a competent L60 Wizard with Clarity 2 using Sunstrike or Ice Spear, amount to not quite half of your average L60 Warrior's damage output.  This doesn't take into account ridiculous new weapons from Sleeper's Tomb.  Wizards ARE A BURDEN TO THEIR GROUP!<P>And the solution is to FIX, not "improve", but FIX their efficiency.<P>I already proposed a proximity-based spell or spells, allowing no increase in efficiency under solo conditions but providing an eight-to-one (close to a Warrior's damage output) efficiency from melee range.  Restrictions on recast or damage per cast could be used to prevent the Wizard from doing damage TOO fast (that way, we successfully prevent the Wizard from actually succeeding at what is supposedly his official job in the game).<P>Calls for a larger mana pool or bigger nukes or even fewer resists are not solutions.  My own proposal isn't much of a solution either because under raid scenarios it places the Wizard in a special kind of peril.  But efficiency IS the solution, and yes an eight-to-one casting ratio would literally only be as good as a typical Warrior; it would still be inferior to most pure damage classes and Wizards would still have a lack of group desirability to deal with.<P>Arkmaru<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alright, I've played a Wizard since Last summer and they are my favourite class but we do have fundamental problems. <P>Resist Rates: This is sickening. I mean we do full damage very rarely in the higher level game, and if we get resisted fully the mob actually seems even madder at us. If you don't want to make Wizard spells less resistible (like they should be, and this goes for WIZARDS ONLY) then make it so that mobs do NOT aggro on total resists and only minor aggro on partial.<P>The purposed larger mana pool: This is, quite honestly, a very bad idea. So you'll let us have a better chance at doing damage just so we can sit down with our good 'ol spellbook and stare at it 4x as long? I don't think so. If you do this we'll have to have better mana regen or have all the mana costs for our spells dropped.<P>Now, I'm not saying everything we've been told that might happen is bad, oh no, but it's all conditional. Like I said above, if we get a larger mana pool (again only wizards should get it) then we must, ABSOLUTLY MUST, have faster regen or lower mana costs. <P>I'm also tired of being out damaged. Mages and enchanter do FAR more for a gorup than us. Mages have some very nice damage spells that make some of ours pale in comaprison at certain levels plus their own little tank (so basically they do double damage, honestly, watch a high level mage with his pet and you'll understand) and enchanters simply get to say "No, you're gonna sit there while your buddy gets beat on Mr.BadassMob". So if we're the "Masters of Damage" why can't we drop a mob that's screaming towards us, intent on seeing our innards visit the outside world, at our feet? <P>The bottom line (and everyone here has said it)<P>lower resists + better damage = happy/useful wizards<P>That's it. Past that there's the idea of percentile damage spells (which I like ALOT) and some others. I've done alot of reading and I know you have too, and that I really respect, honestly, but please please please, don't ignore these pleas and say "it's unbalancing". Because it honestly is not.<P>Thankyou for all your time and effort, it is greatly appreciated by everyone here.<P>Templar96</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>HAHAHAHA!!!! Found it!!!! Thank the Lord! Took long enough. Anyway, I have been surfing for a long time, looking at EQ. After a full hour and a half, I found this. I must say. All the stuff I have been hearing from Verant is utter and total grade A USDA inspected bull and that is the truth. I have heard no end to the reasons why we can't get any stronger. For the benefit of those of you who were lucky enough to avoid knowing the reasons, sorry, here they are: <P>For reasons unbeknowest to some of you, I will speak as if I am a Verant Representative (no offense to Absor and the others and what-not, I like the game and I give Verant major props (damn cousin rubbing off on me again) for making the game in the first place) <P>1) *in whiny nasal voice* you get port spells so you don't need any more advantages <P>MY ANSWER *my voice this time* <BR>Yes, that is all well and good... for NON COMBAT. Please tell me, what practical purpose do ports serve in combat as support (ie not running through warp tunnels in an evac screaming MY HAIR IS ON FIRE HELP HELP HELP!!!!!!)???? <P>2) *back to whiny nasal voice* yes ok, but what about the fact that you get root spells and the like? you don't really need anything more, just root and nuke like you were meant to <P>MY ANSWER *for those of you that can't catch on this is in my voice too* <BR>Yes, ok, but how often do those POS spells stick? 1 outa 10? 1 outa 20? Nuff said. <P>3) Yes, well you have incredible nuking (and here I cut them off) <P>MY ANSWER (pre-emptive) <BR>NO! WE DON'T, IF WE DID WOULD ANY OF US BE HERE TODAY WASTING OUR TIME ASKING FOR MORE!!!!????!!! <BR>Lemme see...... we can't nuke a pair of fetid dingo kidneys (sorry too much sci-fi talking) about the fact that you think (and I say that jokingly) that you think we are balanced. Lemme see, everyone nukes just as well, but we don't get pets to help us if we screw up, our root/snare/bof lines don't help for squat, and even enchanters make fun of us for lack of power<P>OH AND BEFORE ANYONE SAYS IT BECAUSE I KNOW IT WILL INVARIABLY COME UP (don't ever say this anyone) <P>"Why are you guys complaining, you act as if you are not already the best casters." <P>[CENSORED] [CENSORED] [CENSORED] [CENSORED] [CENSORED] [CENSORED] [CENSORED] [CENSORED] [CENSORED] [CENSORED} [CENSORED} [CENSORED} [CENSORED} [CENSORED} [CENSORED} [CENSORED} [CENSORED} [CENSORED} [CENSORED} [CENSORED} [CENSORED} [CENSORED} [CENSORED} [CENSORED} <P>(for those of you that must know what I said, send a station-gram thingy to TempestLord) <P>WE ARE NO WHERE NEAR THE BEST<P>For the benefit of anyone who wishes to get through to Verant, please send 1 E-Mail entitled "Petition Support" and leave your UserName. I will forward all of them with a petition to Verant. Hopefully, getting somewhere near 100 e-mails with the same title, and a petition to actually LOOK AT THE BOARDS will help. As far as I can tell, they aren't taking us seriously, lets make sure that they do. Any Wizards that are serious about this, send an email, if you wanna just hear me curse out verant, send a station gram thingy, if you want to do something (again) send an email. <P>I have tried before, but without some people backing me up on this they kinda say: <P>Isn't that nice, another stupid Wizard can't keep his mouth shut? (mentally) <P>They actually say: <P>Thank you for you suggestions, we are happy to know what our consumers think. <P>Or some BS like that. Now, if they do that when asked by email, and they don't respond to these posts, and they don't ever boost our ability: <P>WHAT MAKES ANY OF YOU THINK THAT THIS IS GETTING THROUGH TO THEM WITHOUT MAKING A DIRECT PETITION<P>So once more: <BR>shadowtemplar86@hotmail.com <P>Send 1 email entitled: <BR>"Petition Support" <BR>And as many others as you like with what to put on it (and I WILL put it on) entitled: <BR>"Petition Ideas" <BR>If you think I am an idiot, PLEASE JUST FLAME ME don't send me junk, and if you really think that Verant is listening I have news for you: <BR>Santa isn't real<BR>The tooth fairy doesn't exist <BR>Colombus was not the first into America <BR>Money doesn't grow on trees <BR>Pigs don't fly <BR>Cows can't jump over the moon <BR>Radios are not tiny people trapped in cages that sing and play instruments <BR>AND <BR>Wolff will never get a girlfriend (oops, sorry) <P>among other things <P>More of my junk later, I am not in the proper state of mind to be writing this anyway. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alan please look into the completed fa quests of all classes. If you think that wizards are just complaining to make the wizy fa easier to get you are wrong. We are complaining because the wizy Fa quest if impossible to do. If it was obtainable in terms of performing the quest that's one thing but many people have complained that it's Impossible to do. OK I guess 1-2 wizy fa quests per server is ok as an average but you got tons of rogues who have the RB over in the 20s per server and the numbers are similar to clerics and warriors. I just ask you find out how many fa quest are out there and make an analysis whether or not, there is a discrepency.<P>Pluto<BR>This is a valid balance issue since the FA is supposed to be our defining weapon. Plus, Its not right the wizy fa has some clarity. We were never defined with that kind of spells but you know the casting on the fa staff should of been a DD type spell. We got mega nerfed on this one folks!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What should have been done a long time ago:<P>Items should have been given levels restrictions just as our spells were given level restrictions. You can't even scribe a spell until you reach the level of that spell, but a lvl 1 warrior can weild a Jade Mace, wear full Cobalt and a Dragonborne Sash. Their weapons are the equivalent of our spells...and therefore should have had level restrictions. Just as procs have been set to not go off prior to a certain level, weapons and even armor should not be usable under a certain level. That would have prevented the massive twinking that quickly infused this game which, in turn, lead to the massive ramping up of mobs HP. A weapon that drops of a lvl 50 mob should be unweildable by a melee under lvl 45, for example.<P>As for my suggestion about the stamina and lack of repercussions facing the melee classes, I'm not suggesting a drastic switch to a stamina based system. Anyone who plays a melee class knows that you DO lose stamina in a fight, but you lose it at an extrememly lower rate than wizard lose mana. One solution would be to significantly increase their stamina loss while simultaneously reducing both the regeneration rate AND the effect of zing. A warrior with zero stamina merely has to STAND STILL for about 30 seconds to be completely revitalized.<P>As the game is now, Shamans, Clerics and Enchanters are designed to focus all their efforts on the melee class. Shamans make them fight faster, hit harder, fight longer, dodge more, proc more while making mobs fight slower, and hit softer. Clerics make melee classes live longer, increase their AC and HP and instantly regenerate their stamina. Enchanters even make melee live longer through mezzing and also make them hit faster and proc more often. ALL we get is the Clarity line of spells to assist us in regenerating mana. We get the AC and HP buffs from the clerics starting off, but once into a prolonged camp the clerics attention is solely focused on the melee classes. We are left to fend for ourselves. <P>To balance the wizards and return us to our rightful status as the pinnacle of magical damage dealers: simply increase our mana regeneration rate on an order of magnitude 5-10x what it is now without C2 OR increase our efficiency along the same order of magnitude (Draught of Ice would be 716dd for 110mana) significantly curtail the resist rates of our spells across the board; remove pets from the equation in regards to Rain spells....oh...and shoot that designer that made our "epic" quest and epic item.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The problems of wizards.<P>- Low damage output over a long period of time.<BR>  -  Low mana regeneration rate.<BR>  -  Resists on mobs.<BR>  -  damage level cap on damage.<P>- Area of effect spell effectiveness.<BR>  -  The Al'kabor line of spells<BR>  -  Pets and their effect.<P>- Verants problem with wizards.<BR>  -  Soloing ability<BR>  -  Kill stealing ability<BR>  -  Wizards desirability in groups.<P><BR>Lets look at the soloing wizard. As long as a wizard has Jboots or sow potions they can solo relatively easy. There are enough risks involved still, fizzles, breakages, resists of all types, low hp and low ac. With out speed augmentation it still doable but MUCH harder.<P>Now on to kill stealing. In the early days wizards could kill steal from groups because of their extra fire power and the way kill ownership was awarded. Verant  first clipped the wizards wings, and then went on to change how kill ownership was awarded, without giving the wizards wings back afterwards. I doubt very much that pre-nerfd wizard could kill steal from groups now, considering a caster group can't even get the kill against a melee group these days. Their pre-fifty damage should be restored to them.<P>Then  there is the main problem wizards in groups. A member of a group should be able to fill their role in a group adequately. This has three area, damage dealing, healing and utility functions. At the moment everyone knows that a wizard cant pull his weight under the strain of a constant stream of pulls. On slow stream he can keep up, as long as the hp of the mobs isn't insane. He can shine on pulls with a lot of time in between to meditate, again if the hp of the mobs isn't insane. <BR> <BR>From this point the specialty of the class should add to the group, with wizard it's the fast burn, and that's it. All other specializing casters have their role, followed by the utility casters. For wizards to fill this role there mana regeneration should be much greater, in that with a constant pull of mobs the wizard should be able to maintain the same mana level over time. Having enough mana to burn a mob down when the occasion arises. At the moment it isn't the case.<P>The reason why wizards are not given either more mana, more efficiency or mana regeneration is that it would over power their soloing ability. It should be obvious that the mana regeneration rate should be upped only when the wizard is in a group, and dependent on how many in that group. This should be applied to all specialists depending upon the need/balancing issues, Where the wizard is most dependent on mana. <P>The rain spells problem. The pre-fifty AOE spells were not fixed from there over powered state early in the game, they were destroyed, and left that way. They need a bit of work damage/mana ratios, waves and pets taking up hits. Its just they never got around to looking at them after their destruction was issued.<P>Last of all, the damage level cap and resists. These seem to have been made to make some mobs unsoloable, and intended to be done by groups. Lures were added to balance out the resist side, it should also be removed from the damage level cap too. This would add more balance to the lure line.<P><BR>Group mana bonus<P>Mana per tick = Meding Mana + clarity effects<BR>                + Specialization*(number in group-1)*(level modifier).<P>Where the specialization is :<BR>Wizard = 4<BR>Magician = 2<BR>Cleric = etc…….<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Like Harvest, the Robe is more or less a waste.<P>With that said, I'd like to suggest a balance in the gear/loot and skills as well. <P>Most suggestions point to spells, casting spells, and mana regen rates.  Sure, efficiency stems directly from the spells and mana regeneration, but what about skills and loot?<P>Someone tell me what loot is available to Wizards that balance them?  INT is capped at 200- My Wiz has had 200+ INT since level 34 and it hasn't helped me...  I want a mana stone and a mana robe and perhaps newly designed channeling gear for my wiz, make all of it no drop, wiz only.<P>What about new skills for Wizards?  I suggest a reworking of the channeling skill. Channeling should make a spell dirt cheap!  I never noticed a difference in my spell efficiency due to becoming a master at channeling.  On that note, what the heck is it for?<P>I completely agree, Wizards need to be fixed, not improved.  Please leave the sight spells out of the equation, same thing for the pointy hat.  I want real fixes that impact playability/balance.<P>Whether it be in the form of spell casting efficiency, skill based improvements, or a much greater availability of Wiz only No Drop gear that achieves the same end, I can care less.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Some comments and a new idea or two<P>Scenario:<BR>Group pulls a nice blue mob.  Wizard casts stun a fraction of a second early, its resisted 'cos its early, mob aggroes on wizard, runs past everything else and starts hitting the wizard like crazy.  Cleric tries to heal, warrior tries to taunt, wizard dies or nearly dies.  Everyone gets irritated at the wizard for nearly getting killed.<P>Wizard may attempt to cast a spell in an attempt to help, of course, interupt wait-till-end-of-spell recast-delay, spell cast interupt wait-till-end-of-spell-cast recast-delay... repeat till wizard is dead.<P>Scenario:<BR>We have downtime, and a lot of wizards sit during a fight.  Result - Mob says, oooh look a wizard sitting down, lets run over and kill it.  Wizard gets beat to hell.<P>Solutions:<BR>Ok, so we have no defence, no armour, no hit points.  We do have intelligence.  Drastically reduce mobs ability to interupt wizards and knock them off their feet all the darn time when we DO get hit.  Or just increase "you regain your concentration and continue casting" as a wizard ability.  It'd give us a fighting chance instead of holding back and hoping someone will help us.  Limit it to point blanks if you absolutely must.<BR>=======================================================<BR>You have got better at regaining concentration.(200)<BR>=======================================================<P><BR>You have got better at sitting on your butt.(200)<BR>Ok, we meditate, get shakes without clarity and mana song, and sit on our butts except for the time it takes to stand up and blow the hell out of some mob.  Increase mana regeneration, stack it with everything else, what are we supposed to do, swing and miss with the trusty staff-of-the-wheel ?  <P>Resist rates.  Nuff said.<BR>Damage rates.  Nuff said.<P>You have got better at blowing stuff up(200)<P>Eye of Zomm.  What a lovely spell this is.  Pity it runs out so quick and can't spot players when the wizard is out of visual range...   Pity you can't cast spells through it, heck, it's an extension of the wizard and the mob comes straight after you after killing it, could at least make it worth the while and able to levitate, speaking of which...<P>Levitate II.  Lasts longer, works better, doesn't need you to carry round a backpack of batwings...<P>Ports, this one is interesting.  Some of the landing points are &lt;cough&gt; a little dangerous, and could west karana's port be a bit closer to north karana please ?  Wouldn't it be nice if actually porting left a residual energy trace in the wizard (and the group too I guess) that made it highly unlikly that they could be hurt ?  At least for long enough to cast invisibility, or SOMETHING.  Being beat up on a landing is just, well, no fun, specially if you have zero defence against it.<P>Concussion.  I've heard of this spell, it sounds really quite nice, I'd like to be able to cast it.  I have no objections to soul collecting in areas that require certain death as such, but I thought that was a necros job.  Hang on, don't we need one for parts of it ?  Never mind.  It would be nice if it was actually possible to get the spell at the level intended though.<BR>Invisibility to undead.  Awesome idea, maybe I could finally get past the entrance in lguk, if the spell was possible to find.  How long are we supposed to yell for help at the entrance anyway ?  Just curious.<P>Hit Points and Mana.<BR>There is a spell that allows melee (and other classes for that matter) regain large amounts of hit points, (even during a fight), allowing them to continue without even sitting down !!!!  I've also heard when they get tired, they can get hit with stimulants to stop them being tired without sitting down !!!!   This is incredible stuff.  Of course, wizards have to sit down for long periods to regenerate mana...<P>You have got better at divining how long till the next spawn...  (just like sense heading)<BR>The shaman has got better at doing the spawn dance...<P>New spell for wizards.  Invunerability to normal weapons.  You attempt to strike a wizard, but a wizard is invunerable !   (Use a magic weapon dude)  Sensible duration would be similar to flickering flame.  Uses a stupid burned out lightstone or something like that as a componant.<P>Invunerability to magical weapons.  Will not stack with invun.norm.weap, much shorter duration.<P>New spell for wizards:<BR>Wizard Fury.  Expends ALL mana and converts to Direct Damage based on amount of mana left & wizard stamina and agility drops to 10%.  Uninteruptable, and irrisistable.  Insane aggro potential.  Ridiculously long recast time.  Perhaps the mob cannot be outright killed by this and is left weak and running away, and the wizard is far too weak to give chase.<P><BR>New spell for wizards.  Since we have very little defensive capability, this spell adds a little.<BR>CONTINGENCY.  Wizard casts this and a second preparatory spell expending mana for both.  When the contingency "event" occurs, the second spell is instantly cast on the specified target.<BR>Example: Contingency - invisibility.  If the wizard is getting beat to hell, the wizard goes invisible and the mob beats someone else up.<BR>Contingency shadowstep.  If the wizards damage-absorbing shield goes down, shadow step somewhere slightly safer.<BR>Contingency gate: Yeah, I know thats too much to hope for.<BR>Contingency concussion: Woohoo !  Wizard gets beat up too much, mob suddenly forgets all about it.<BR>This would probably be a long-recast-delay spell, or a high failure rate though.<P><BR>Summary:<BR>1: You have got a lot better at regaining your concentration.<BR>2: You have got better at mana regeneration<BR>3: You have got better at blowing stuff up<BR>4: You have got better at casting spells through your eye of zomm<BR>5: You have got better at casting spells through your bind-sight target<BR>6: You have got better at doing fast direct damage<BR>7: You have shadow stepped far enough to actually live<BR>8: You have got better at shouting for a group<BR>9: You havn't aggroed the mob at all with that resist since you can't hurt it...<BR>10:You have gained some new cool spells</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>*Great idea* - Anyone agree??<P>Well i have posted a couple posts with some ok ideas but i think this is probably the best one i've come up with yet, I dont' think anyone else has said it but correct me if i'm wrong.<P>First wizards are suppose to be the most powerful spell casters in dd. Meaning they have extreme channeling powers. SOOOO<P>I say if they are masters at channeling why not give them the power to channel there energy into another class.<P>For example:<P>A (tank) a (cleric) and a (wizard) are in a group<BR>the (tank) is getting spanked and the (cleric) is getting low on mana, and can only cast one more heal, lets say the heal will do 400hp. The (tank) has 1500hp. The (wizard) with his powers to channel, channels his power into the (cleric) and now when the (cleric) casts that heal it does double the effect. healing for 800hp.<P>This would SOOOOOO improve the wizards group effectiveness. Could double any spell or just be restricted to healing or other spells.<P>This could so easily help out a group in trouble. Double a heal, double the time a stun lasts, double the effect of a buff, but could make it so it reduces the buffs duration to level it out.<BR>Make the person blink or glow when the channel effect is casted on them and have the channel effect like a 8 second duration so they can't cast more than one spell.<P>just another suggestion, anyone else like?<P>Ciris<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I've always been fond of the idea that wizards could enchant weapons to hand off to warriors.  Magicians are the summoners and let them continue <BR>to summon utility items to server the community. On the other hand wizards can enchant non-magical weapons that become no rent so that groupies can use great weapons.  this would make the wizard more group friendly since tanks would have something to look forward to. the enchanted weapon, being no rent would be consumed by the magic that enchants it upon link death or camping.  Make the procs insane so that we can get some damage off without the need to agro mobs onto us.  Enchanters might get pissed because they feel that this ability should be the province of enchantment, not evocation. To this I say that in enchanting an item it should be permanent like your jewelery, wizards are merely channeling their power through an object and this is why the weapon becomes consumed.  For balance issues you may want the weapon to have a duration and then dissapear (along with the fs/forged weapon) instead of making it no rent.  This would also revive the blacksmithing trade seeing as players wont neccesarily want to camp for fs everytime they want a wizard to give you a bone.  <BR>How many tanks will start to carry around non magical weapons in hopes of offering it to a wizard for the benefit of his spells.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I would think enchanting items belongs to teh Enchanter class... no?<P>Wizards harness energy, transform it, and use it for great offensive strikes...  Channeling this energy through another player is something I'd go for.  If channeling through another player is implemented, it has to be at such a cheap cost to the Wizard it would be incredibly efficient.<P>For example, a PB AE spell should do 1000 dmg for a mere 100 mana.  Obviously, this would only be used while in groups.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'll try to keep this as short as possible, but I have a lot to say.<P>The main complaint seems to be that we wiz's have problems finding groups.  Verant has always encouraged grouping.  It goes along with "The Vision" they had way back when they first came out with this game.  So not being able to find a group could be a serious problem.<P>Personally, I think at the higher lvls, wiz's are pretty well balanced.  Yes, we suck early on, but as mentioned before, this weeds out that weak and is probably healthy for our class as a whole.  From the mid-30's on, I think wiz's are very good with groups as it is (except in Velious).  That's why from here on out, I'm mainly talking about the problems with ahigher lvl wiz.<P>Complaints about resistances and such were covered before and resulted in our having our spells having a built-in lower resistance and a new line of Lure spells.  Yes, they didn't do as much dmg as most of us would've liked, but it was a compromise.  A step in the right direction.  <P>Now, the problem is that with Velious, the mobs now have a ridiculous amount of hp.  Add to that the high resist rate, and we once again have a problem.  <P>I think the best solution could probably be with the line of spells that was added to our arsenal earlier: the Lure line of spells.<P>-  Lower the Lure resist rate even more.  Although they do work a lot better than our normal spells, people have been complaining that they're getting a lot of resists from a "practically unresistable" spell.<P>-  Lower the mana cost for Lure spells.  Preferably by half.  I know this may seem like a rediculous amount at first, but some of those mobs in Velious have a lot of hp.  We would like to do more dmg throughout the longer battles.  Even with being able to cast twice the amount of Lure spells, we'll still only be able to take off a tiny amount of hp from the bigger mobs.  But at least we'll feel a little better since we'll be busy a little while longer.<P>-  Lower the aggro for Lure spells.  This will also make us more benefitial in a group situation, and not really help us while soloing.  Unlike most other classes, wiz's have only one main purpose: to do dmg.  We don't have the hp's, pets, heals, or other utility spells or skills that other classes use to contribute to the group.  We have crap agility, crap AC, and crap hp.  If something's pissed at us, we get hit hard, fast, and often.  And with no feign or fear spells, there's little chance for escape (this is where the concussion spell comes in, but not all wiz's have that- even lvl 50+ wiz's).  Lowering the agro for Lure spells will help us do our job a little better.<P>-  Lastly, I think the casting time for Lure spells should be increased.  Right now it's around 6 secs or so.  I think 8-10 would be better.  The longer casting time will also help justify the lower agro.  This will make sure we aren't just chain casting, and it makes Lures significantly less practical for soloing.  Yet this won't really hurt us in a group because the mob should be pounding on the tanks.  <P><BR>Okay, in short, Lure's were always meant as a group-type spell.  They are used to hit stuff we normally wouldn't be able to hit, and therefore would not be soloing anyway.  I feel the changes listed above would make us more appealing for grouping, while not making us overly powerful.<P>Okay, I'm done.  Flame away.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>We definetly need something to help our mana situation.  A mana pool increase would be okay....I was thinking pets though.  Before you start yelling at me about how thats stupid, let me explain.  These pets would not do any dammage at all...just follow you around and grant a buff-like increased mana regen or something.  Sone of you might have heard about this idea, I don't know, haven't seen it posted around here.  I really like it.  It makes the class a little more fun, having a little bixie or whatever follow you around (at least I think it would....gets incredibly boring on solo xp camps).  Could be anywhere from a level 20 spell to a 40 spell.  Could also have a cool quest to get it...but has to be obtainable at the level, not like Concussion.  Tell me what you think.  It could completely fix the mana problem if VI gives it enough of a mana regen increase.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I personally have a RL to live, and EQ is a distraction for me. Well, at least it started OUT as a distraction, but has sucked me in as it has for so many. Because I havn’t had as much time as many, I’ve only played my Wizard over the past year. And have gotten him to 51 now, almost 52.<P>I can truly say that post 50, I am having 10X the problem in finding a group in the higher level areas like Sebilis or Karnor or XXX, unless it is for the sole purpose of being the “evac’er” or taxi. Quite frankly, I can see why. We really can’t contribute to a group as much as the other classes. There is NOTHING in our class that makes us desirable, let alone indispensable to a group, unless it’s a raid on Nagafen, VOX, or some such. In many cases, it’s the opposite, and we are a hindrance to the group with our long downtimes when our manna is depleted. <P>I REALLY like the suggestion of enabling us to channel our manna into a norent weapon that will last for a limited time, and be able to give it to a tank. Something like be able to have the weapon proc the spell we imbued on it. We could then make AoE weapons, Point Blank AoE weapons, DD weapons, etc. Also make it that a wizard has to make the weapon himself out of components that have to be gathered all over Norath, using BS’ing skills. This would then revive the blacksmithing skills, and make them more popular. This would do SO much to our group desirability, but would not be super easy either(gathering of components, getting the BS’ing skills necessary, etc). Come to think about it, this would be kinda like a cleric that has to spend PP on buying expensive components to cast damage shields and such.<P>I also REALLY like the idea of a percentage based line of spells for the Uber mobs in Vellious, and elsewhere. This would NOT overbalance us. However, it WOULD require a different set of tactics and thinking to use because of the agro it would cause. You could cast it early on to get the bigger % hit, but then you would be almost assured of getting the mob on you, and getting killed. Wait until the mob is at half HP, then cast, but do less damage. Cast early, and expect a rez. Bind nearby, and try to get a gate off, etc, etc. New tactics, new thinking, but bringing Wizards back to being DESIRABLE, if not necessary for a group.<P>Just my thoughts so far.<P><BR>Afwan<BR>51 Wizard<BR>Prexus<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Personally I think that the wizard is a soloing class.  Although I have only played one up to 38, my best experience times come when I am soloing.  Therefore I think we should add some spells to assist with soloing.  Perhaps some specific "Sense" spells.  Necros get Sense Dead.  Magicians get Sense Summoned.  Wizards, as the uber magic users should be able to sense energy patterns of other beings.  Therefore a new line of sense's should be introduced.  Things like Sense Giant (for those long waits in the Karanas or commons), Sense Dragon (Burning Woods hunting), or perhaps Sense Caster (with a different name of course, but it makes sense for a wizard being able to lock on to another caster's energy).

</FONT><HR>  Thank you Absor for responding.  It is nice to know that you are still hanging in there and reading through all of our posts. :-)<P>  I have been thinking about ways of improving the wizard class in group scenarios while not unbalancing them in regards to their ability to solo.  The solution that comes to mind is our rain line of spells.  These spells are really good.  In theory.  For a fairly small amount of mana they do a lot of damage.  However these spells will hit pets, multiple mobs thus breaking mesmerised creatures and also have a tendency to be resisted on several of the waves.<P>  The way that I think these spells could help would be to make them single target.  Or else bring in a new line of rain spells that is single target.  Since these new spells would be single target I would suggest that the number of waves be increased.  Instead of doing three waves, have then do five or even six.  This would allow a wizard to contribute substantially to the damage being done in a group scenario without increasing their solo capability.  For the rains to be effective you need a fairly stationary mob, when soloing this is rarely the case.  The new rains would also have to be much harder to resist against if they were to be truly effective.<BR> <BR> A spell line that I think the wizard class should have is a retaliatory strike one.  What I mean by this is a spell that is cast upon the death of the wizard.  It is of no benefit to the wizard, they are dead, but I think it is appropriate.  I think it fits the wizard mentality.  The sort of you might have managed to kill me, but I am taking you with me, kind of thing.  I am thinking of perhaps four spells in this line.  The first, at 29, multiplies the remaining mana that the wizard has by five and hits the mob that has just slain the wizard.  The next would be at 39.  This would do ten times the remaining mana as damage.  49 would do fifteen times the remaining mana.  60 would do twenty times the remaining mana.  As can be seen, if a wizard is fighting and using mana, the damage done by this spell would not be much.  However, if the wizard has been surprised and has full mana, the damage done by this spell would be immense.  It wouldn’t do the wizard any good, but it would make you feel better to know that you have taken your opponent with you. :-)<P>  Another spell for wizards that I was thinking of was sustainable stun.  Basically the wizard casts the spell and the mob is stunned for say four seconds.  The initial spell costs four hundred mana to cast.  The wizard then maintains the spell at a cost of one hundred mana per second.  The spell lasts until either the monster is dead or the wizard is out of mana.  The spell cannot be cancelled by any other means and the wizard cannot move while the spell is in operation.<P>  I think I will end this post here.  I don’t want it to get too long. :-)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It has been a while, but I remember someone posting about deep meditation. At lvl 35 we begin to not have to look at our book any longer, so, why not let the wizard (or any other caster for that matter) continue to look at his book with the added benefit of a higher rate of mana in return (could go up by level, or could be like clarity). This would shut the player out from seeing what is happening (a large penalty in my view), but would benefit the group and the caster with quicker mana regeneration.<P>My 2 cps worth.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt; These pets would not do any dammage at all...just follow you around and grant a buff-like increased mana regen or something.<P>I have got to admit, the more I think about the possibility of a Familiar (this is the word most people have used when referring to the above possibility), the more interested I become.  A Familiar that hovers near the Wizard at all times (no pathing.. just basically floats near the Wizard's head faithfully), is totally incapable of offense of any sort, is basically dead whenever anything at all attacks it (if mobs have the option, anyway), and is there solely to provide Wizards with either 1) mana regen, 2) dramatically reduced costs for all spells, or 3) dramatically increased damage for all nukes, or a combination of all three, ultimately balancing out to where Wizards can match the damage output of Warriors over time (as I explained in earlier posts, a L60 Wizard does roughly half the damage over time of a L60 Warrior with typical equipment).<P>Certainly, it's a much more appealing concept than simply throwing Wizards new nukes.  But if Verant took this idea and ran with it, we Wizards would have to be VERY skeptical.  This would be the perfect opportunity for Verant to give us YET ANOTHER "bone" without actually taking a significant step towards solving the #1 Wizard problem (efficiency), sort of like Harvest.  They could make the Familiar provide nearly immeasurable regen, or "up to X percent stronger nukes" when in reality the average enhancement is 5%, or something along those lines.  Yes, I FULLY expect Verant to give us another half-measure, and I'm frankly just waiting to see what the do to try to give it a good face.<P>As for the other ideas to "fix" the class, I'll mention the ones I see recurring the most:<P>1) Bigger mana pool.  Shrug, this would help you last longer in an emergency.  Emergencies are not the norm when grinding, or if they are, you probably do not level very fast.  Furthermore, even allowing Wizards to utilize all of 255 int would not give them enough mana to make a significant impact on an emergency in Sebilis-calibre scenarios or harder.  But again I have to stress that emergencies are simply not the norm.  Perhaps that is how Wizards' "fast damage" was so easily allowed to become a farce.<P>2) Proximity nukes.  My pet idea, an easy way out for Verant, giving Wizards nukes that provide no enhanced efficiency under solo conditions but allow them to match Warriors for damage output when grouped.  Nothing whatsoever to do with the number of people in the group; you can either cast while in melee range or you can't.<P>3) Damage based on group number.  Beyond necessitating a full group, this idea simply makes even less sense than my own.<P>4) Percentage nukes.  I don't see Verant implementing this.  In order for these spells to be useful against a 32k hp mob, they would by necessity be far too inefficient to be used on the average "grind" mob, even a 15k hp one like from Kael.  Furthermore, ubermobs fall into two categories: 32k hp, and 100k to 250k hp or thereabouts.  Any spell worth casting on a 32k hp mob would be far too good for an ubermob in the second category.  Verant would never allow it.  Even I am willing to admit that.<P>Anyway, I will be very, very interested to see what Absor means by ideas he "thinks we will like".  Whether we like it or not, it will set the pace for what he's decided we're going to get.  Only question on my mind is how thoroughly he misjudges our predicament.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
