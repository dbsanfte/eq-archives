</FONT><HR>Hey all, Koraf was band from the game and he now goes by furor. It is apparent that verant knows this and has done nothing about this. I for one feel the FOH should be disband and all members that took part in power leveling him to 50 in just 3 weeks hould be banded as well. I play a 50 warrior and have ran across many rude people in many guilds but, I have seen more rude and dis-respectful players come from the FOh than the sum of bad players in all the guilds. They may help other guilds or players out once in awhile but I am sure it was to there advantage to do so.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well, i want to speak my mind against FoH.. Sure they were the first to kill Vox (on any server i belive, and nafagen for that matter, anybody who's been playing since the launch, has prob heard what Lady Vox said when she was killed - SERVER WIDE - it was somthing like: Fires of the Heavens, i will find you, and destroy you!) about that time, Sacred Haven had taken too much crap from FoH.. Yeah, in the begining, when all of the japanese flocked to Veeshan, i remember being in Runnyeye, and when a jap(who didnt know english) was looking for sombody of his ethnic to group with, 3 FoH members immedatily started shouting total BS.. example "adkfjlke 20 oafjdlke grolklkfeoj JPN group!" and crap like that.. I KNOW that was not liked as then an argument broke out between them.. THat was tottaly rude and VERY disrespectful! 2nd thing, is that one time, me and one of my best friends in EQ is Neeawn, he was about lvl 13 when he went to Freeport, saw Mrylizz (i dont care how you spell it!) guild leader of FoH.. i told Neeawn the shi* they have done to people, but he didnt belive me, he said that i was wrong, and so was my guild - Sacred Haven - so i said whatever and went to go start blacksmithing, soon, Neeawn inspected him (Myrlizz) and wanted to see items he had never seen before and get the names and stuff, so when he was 50 he could use them. Well, just then, Myrlizz snaped, and started shouting, "WTF did you inspect me for? everbody inspects me, and you did too! why? becuse you want to see my items? NO, THERE MY ITEMS. Inspecting sombody without there consent is very disrespectful" etc, ect, saying a long ass line of crap. Then neeawn said, "dude, i just was admiring your stuff, but apperently i cant do that becuse you have snapped, and all the stuff about your SHI**Y guild is true. Humph, now on, you, and your entire guild are in IGORE." -- That caused trouble in Freeport, and soon everybody was for Neeawn and against FoH. that caused my guild to have a meeting, we discussed several things that have happened in EQ, we discussed the migration of Japs (We had no problem with it, just seems most of the people in FoH, and other guilds were TOTTALY against them, and would cause trains etc, to get them killed, and us too for that matter) how bad they have twinked people in their guilds, lvl 22's with full Rubicite? bah! thats messed up. The curuption between the Guides/Gm's with FoH (as in : yeah, we will look after and monitor all of FoH's members to make sure they dont do stuff they shouldnt).. the power leveling of their own members, all you had to do was join FoH and within a month, you were lvl 50 becuse they twinked you, and had a high lvl cleric follow you around, to heal/buff :/THAT was not the way Everquest was ment to be played. So Sarcoth (Guild Leader of SH) decided to move to Prexus when it was the new server when it was ready... The final straw was by Mrlizz when he went to Greater Faydark and did some Charity events, sayign the first people to find me in front of felwithe gets 100pp or an item of equal or greater value,soon after he shouted, Why does people diss on FoH, as you just saw, were a caring guild, we care about the people who join, and we are NOT disrespectful...... to me, that influenced newbies who are now they ones defending FoH. as for one of the above post "FoH = Experianced players who have 2 lvl 50's" HMM, i wonder HOW they got 2 lvl 50's EACH!!!!!!!!  one last thing.. Lynx20Bard/Dauthi16ShadowKnight/Dinke18Magician/Sanodar22Paladin - ALL are me, so you can contact me in game if you wish..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I would like to clear some things up about FoH...<P>First of all, during the early days of the game all FoH members were give equipment and help by the GM's and guides.<P>Second of all, we were given bug lists by Brad and GZ so we knew exactly how to exploit everything, which is another reason we got ahead so fast.<P>Third of all, half of our members are actually people who work at Verant and we take out out hostility towards our paying customers by being as rude as possible.<P>Fourth, because we have people who work at Verant in our guild we know how to do everything we really don't need anyone else.<P>Hrm... I think that covers everything. Other than, of course, stating that everything we do is the result of cheating and bug exploiting. But, I mean, that should really be obvious if you look at our accomplishments.<P>Creediki Starsong<BR>Bard of Veeshan<BR>Chronicler of the Fires of Heaven<P>- There is an answer to every question which is simple, easy... and wrong.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

As usual, seems people just have a problem with anyone who is better at a game than them.<P>As far as early on, sorry to say but no FoH was twinked by gm's guides or each other for that matter.  My God.  We have guys who dont even have ykeshas yet at lvl 45.<P>Well flame away, I just thought Id like to laugh at all the ridiculous accusations.<BR>I challenge any of you, especially you Dauthislayer to come chat with me on irc so that you can present any "Facts" you have and I will gladly explain to you how ridiculously misguided you are.<P>We are on gamesnet #foh<BR>Cheerio!<P>Myrlynn S'kye<BR>GuildMaster FoH<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Very few players I think really believe the FoH exploit anything, or get their accomplishments through anything less than blood, sweat, or tears. The vast majority of the FoH I've had contact with have been courteous, good people. But unfortunately, I can't just say good things about the guild.<P>Every time I've been near a Fires member that lost their cool, they often show no class. Stupid arguments happen, but most people have enough decency to not resort to Training, constant harassing kill stealing, and pretty offensive vulgarity. I'm not going to claim that guides/gms overlook questionable activities (not exploits, just screwing with other players) just because they are FoH members. That is silly, guides/GMs overlook that stuff routinely, which is why so many players do them without a second thought. What disturbs me the most is kind of the attitude that training a newbie is more of a practical-joke than anything, rationalizing it that their deaths don't really matter. I bet it is a minority of members, but some folks in your guild have the gut reaction of, 'That guy just ticked me off, I'm going to now be 10 times worse and KS him for an hour'. Just control your tempers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I think dogging on FOH because they are better players then you are is absolutely ridiculous. If u dont like the way they do things or any other guild for that matter go to another server.

This is my highest lvl character, I have no god, planes, dragon loot and have never been twinked.  Have never exploited nor cheated, nor seen or heard of any member cheating other then from msg boards like this from low lvls that only hear rumors.  I have been in guild longer then the majority that is in FoH now and if any exploiting or cheating has gone on I would know about it.  We have GM's watching us 90% of the time. Yes things have been changed aftet they observed us doing things, not because of exploits but because they were not near as hard as they had meant them to be.  YOu can all believe what you will. <P>Stridar (FOH)<P>P.S. This was all totally fabricated we really do cheat, KS, and exploit.  80% of our members do work for Verant.

I have been in guild longer then the majority that is in FoH now and if any exploiting or cheating has gone on I would know about it. <P>Stridar(FoH), what a strange and funny thing to say.  So you are admitting to knowing all about the exploiting/cheating that Kalaran did, that was deemed so significant that an account wipe was deemed appropriate.  That you in fact approve of the exploiting and/or cheating, by virtue of passively or explicitly power leveling a known exploiter/cheater to level 50 within 2 weeks.<P>In the past you have shown considerably more intelligence than this post of yours (and considerably more intelligence than your post on the MW thing).  Is the price for being in FoH so great that you really need to make these very stupid statements?<P>Enigma Maitreya<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

So for you to think that you do know is funny.  But I do know that no exploit was used by any FoH to lvl or gain exp.  <P>Actually he was twinked to lvl 50 in a week. That was not a cheat or a exploit.  Was just alot of guild members helping another out.  Hell I no some one that has three accounts and 3 computers he twink a warrior from 1-50 in just over 4 days.  So what that doesn't affect anyone.<P>2nd I don't know what post you are referring to about the MW(I have made many).

</FONT><HR>Stridar,<P>Thanks for clearing that (knowing/not knowing about Kal's account wipe) up.<P>My issue still stands that it seems somewhat suspect to somewhat disingenuous for FoH to claim to be against (not condoning) Exploitation and show case the ability/willingness to PowerLever a “convicted” (can’t think of a better word at the moment) exploiter, as though to thumb their noses at the EQ Team and the Veeshan citizens.  He he, if this were the case, then why would FoH be surprised that we the Veeshan citizens and the EQ Team, become more firm in our conviction that FoH  is a guild dedicated to/practices exploit/anti social, tactics/behavior?  He he, this is not to say that any particular “official” exploit was used, rather it is to say FoH exploited/circumvented the game paradigm, that FoH exploited/circumvented the EQ Teams desire to ban Kalaran.<P>You know Stridar, I would think FoH would have seen the hand writing on the wall by now.  Either FoH will enter into a social contract with the rest of Veeshan, not based exclusively on FoH terms but based on cooperating with the overwhelming majority of Veeshan’s citizens or FoH will be handed that social contract based exclusively on the terms of the overwhelming majority of Veeshan’s citizens.<P>He he, no way in Hades am I going to try to wade through that total crap thread on MW, again, to find the post I was referring so I will just simply withdraw it for a lack of real interest on my part.  What a lost opportunity that thread was.  Let’s bash Verant, lets bash druids, lets bash rangers, only rangers are allowed to have a desire to have a MW (cool pet, because after all it is about beating the game, not about people having fun), how totally stupid everyone is if they don’t see it my way and oh by the way Verant as on obscure side note “we think your stupid, mean, cruel and total anti customer for nerfing the MW.  No I am not interested in how or why you came to that decision.  I am just going to stamp my feet and hold my breath and bawl as loud as I can until you put it back the way it was”.<P>Enigma Maitreya<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum31&number=31&thisthread=000070&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum31&number=31&thisthread=000070&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
