</FONT><HR>Absor:<P>Post 50-<P>To affect uber mobs with minimal effect to rest of class:<P>- Targetable vampiric Embrace UPGRADE.<BR>- Group Feign Death or targetable Feign Death<BR>- Change lifetap discipline post 50 to poison or disease rather than magic.<P>Quick explanation:<BR>Vampiric embrace UPGRADE stacks with everything. 50+ point random lifetap. A buff only you can cast, useful for tanks.<P>Group or targetable FD. On raids, Necro can work with Clerics to target soft players who have agroed the mob and FD them...obviously they will need to "stay down" for at least 10 secs to give the greatest chance of the agro being wiped. Again, a USEFUL support role that is in keeping with our class definition. ALSO it means that more than one necro can join the raid as they (being masters of the dead) will be able to assist in keeping more people ALIVE when things go to hell.<P>IF none of the above are done, then perhaps at LEAST make the lifetap line above 50 a different resist line such that they are more likely to land on uber mobs.<P>I would like to end with 2 comments:<P>1) Necro mana-battery is really kind of a stretch. If this is a balance issue, remove these lines completely and permit us to grow in areas more applicable to the Necromancer class. A very good point was made before: 800 mana/ necro vs. a different class with a full bar of 2000+ mana...easy pick I think. Please, it's a little too cuddly for a Necromancer. Balance is an issue, but this was added due to the more "group-friendly" vision for the class (which is fine), but there are FAR more characteristic roles we can fill in a group. (some examples are listed above let me know if you want more...).<P>2) Please recognize that although we have an AWESOME technique for soloing, namely fear kiting, it really shouldn't be the argument that is continuously used to describe the power of a Necromancer. As I am sure you know, this solo technique is not unique to our class.<P>Fear kiting and dotting is done by Druids all through their lives, with the restriction that the mob must be an animal. Frankly, soloing quickly becomes boring and has a poor exp. pay-off especially now that you have [wisely] increased experience bonuses for groups and certain dungeons.<P>I feel very strongly that we have reached a point where additional 'tweaking' to reign in our unacceptable power over individual mobs is really beginning to become a little excessive. We are not any more powerful than any other class. In fact, in most situations I would say that an individual of different class would outperform us at any particular function. What we DO seem to excel at is variety. Therein lies our power...and that is already somewhat limited by having only 8 spell slots, and the simple restriction of time on all encounters (especially in a group).<P>I am struggling to find a facet of our ability that can be described as unbalancing. We have an ability to survive in different environments and situations. Looking at exp gain from soloing, or grouping with 6 necros, planes raids or uber mobs, there is usually a different class that does each desirable function better. <P>One last time...a mana-battery role is not in keeping with our discipline.<P>Our power, our variety, should in part and as a whole, remain Necromancy; and we as academics of pestillence and death, must always be Necromancers.<P><BR>Cophin Sliwryn<BR>Gnome Necromancer, Knights of Vallon<BR>Vallon Zek<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>Pure casters above level 50 , and their ability to be damage contributors in the big raid/epic mob encounters . You guys did casters serious wrong at post 50 .   This is not a Necro only problem . Anyone who plays this game in a dedicated fashion knows that the primary factor that makes or breaks a group , at this stage in the game where it requires friends and orginization to accomplish anything , is the tank and the healer . It revolves around them . <P>These mana pact line spells . These spells will drain you dry , kill you if you dont watch it . It is not all that great , I do in fact prefer clarity , you have any Idea how many times I died cause I had one bulb of health left from mana / shadow compacting , spawn pops then I get whacked in the head once and fall  !! I can not believe you guys are talking about making this tranfer rate crappier . <P>Why must you guys take away ? That is horrible that you *fix* things , if thats what you choose to call it . <P>Group Feign , NO WAY ARE YOU MAD ?! &lt;insert crack reference&gt; . That would be the biggest disaster in the world . I cannot believe that nonsense has even been suggested . Why don't the Necro get the feign upgrade ? <P>I hope at least Emmisary of Thule is made to be unfearable , so being as the class with the best pets already got the fearless pet buff . Summon lost pet spell . I look at mages pets and I want to cry guys , elementals that cast spells , summon pet weapons , monster summoning , if that isnt one of the neatest things in this game i don't know what is , then VI just rubbed it right in our envied faces , and made mage pets unfearable and lost ones summonable . The necro pets need a little more visual diversity . Spectre is the sickest visual in the game for a servant , but what about 1 - 50 ? <P>The Epic Concern . . . .<P>Please make ALL epic weapons , epic encounter worthy , or at least group beneficail . A freaking darkness spell !?  With a sad casting time , even sadder look , a solo weapon . Something not worth the effort . Much less a legendary epic artifact of epic status definition .<P>Make some existing spells targetable , Gather Shadows , would be great , something that simple would help alot of folks out . As would shadow sight , and grim aura . <P>People , show a little dignity , I would hate to think that you selfish , spiteful , instigative , goblin eatin' barnicle pickin , potty face salt lickers , act this way torwards one another when you are out in norrath . </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Post 55 is all about raids IMO.<P>Two necros = non stackable spells.  <P>Necro best dots also owned by Shaman.<P>I hate when I throw out my highly aro EB spell and cant stick it cause the Shammy already cast it.  Eb being one of the only dots I can cast in a raid because it has a decent time on it...mobs always die before it gets done but at least I can do some dmg.<P>Pets cant be used due to pathing or party dosent want necro pets b/c mage pets are immune to certain types of spells.  CoM raids want fire pets...Vox raids water pets..etc<P>At the very most the way things stand MAYBE one necro would be wanted per raid.  MAYBE.<P>The game is about grouping ... VI allowed the necro class to do that well ...<P>BUT THE GAME IS AGOUT GROUPING NOT SOLOING.  The best loot and even the FUN of the game is grouping and necros have almost no grouping power in multi party raids.<P>Anyway...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I could not possibly agree more with what several people have posted in the last page or so.<P>We are necromancers.  We are not mana batteries.  We are not group buffers.  We are, simply, dealers of large amounts of damage over long periods of time (as opposed to "burst" damage - see wizzies).  Dealers in the forces of life and death.  Not "cleric twitchers".<P>I don't want better mana xfer spells.  I would not be unhappy if you removed that spell line entirely.  I want:<P>(1) For more than one necro to have a function in large group situations.  I.e, for our damage spells to stack, and to LAND.<P>(2) For our damage spells not to be near-useless in exp groups.  See long-dot times.  Perhaps reduce DOT running time according to number of people in group, by some appropriate function.  Leave it alone for soloing, so our solo power is unaffected.<P>Half the suggestions i've seen *still* leave 20 necros dealing no more spell damage than one necro.  I think it would be a real shame if we come out of this with that limitation in place.  For that matter, shamans and other DOT classes have the same issue.  We should support them in getting it addressed as well.<P>scr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Dear Absor and Dev team:<P>I would like to put forth some suggestions that would compensate for many nerfs our class has received and that would bring the necromancer back to being desirable and productive addition to groups in dungeons and in raid situations. <P><BR>GENERAL SUGGESTIONS:<P>-reduce the MR of many of the new uber mobs in SOV and ROK, this "mobflation" seems to be the cause of many of the problems for casters and necros in the post 50 game, as well this would help us stick our lifetap line of spells on uber mobs<P>-put some undead content in outdoor zones in SOV, there are zero undead mobs in outdoor zones in SOV, this is not only a nerf to necromancer but SK's, paladins and clerics who have a nice set of anti-undead spells, also bonechips are not readily available in these zones for necros<P>-fix the current code that no longer lets you resume your character if you crash or go link dead, both mages and necros use considerable mana to summon pets and suffer because of this attempt to thrwart cheaters who took advantage of resuming characters to dupe<P>-necro epic - ugly, impractical, very difficult to get, would never use, a complete disaster, there only a few on our server<P>-increase the drops in the planes, in all the raids I have ever been on I've only seen 1 necro item drop and that was a pair of boots in POG a few days ago, what we see is tank armor over and over again<P><BR>FACTION:<P>Why do rangers and druids get a amiable faction with animals and necromancers don't get amiable or at the very least indifferent with the undead?<BR>We are supposed to be the "masters of the undead". The faction system that is in use in lowerguk with undead would also prevent this from being abused.<P><BR>PETS & EXPERIENCE:<P>Currently if your pet does 51% of the damage to the mob it will take half of the exp. This is wrong and needs to be changed. Necromancers shouldn't be competing with their pets to see who can do the most advantage. We are the master of the pets therefore we should get FULL experience for the kill. Pets who are victim of bad pathing in dungeons get me killed all the time, perhaps my pet should take half of my share of exp loss.<P><BR>PET COMMANDS:<P>-new pet command /pet defend (toggles on and off)<P>This new command would allow the pet to continue to fight his chosen target and not defend himself from a mob that has chosen to start beating on him.<P>The most disconcerting problem necromancers have is the reputation that pets have with breaking mez inside dungeons when attacked by mobs other than the mob that is the main target of the group. Implementation of this single command for pets would make finally make the necromancer group friendly. Also the fact that the pathing is absolutely horrendous in most dungeons, this new command would make up for that. <P>-new pet command /pet report level<P>There is currently no way to know a pets lvl unless you sick it on some greens. This command would help.<P><BR>PET DAMAGE:<P>-increase the maximum damage of the lvl 53 pet, the lvl 56 pet and the lvl 59 pet by 2 damage each.<P>lvl 49 pet - hits for 47 to 55 <BR>no change<P>lvl 53 pet - hits for 49 to 57 BS for max 161<BR>new 53 pet - hits for 51 to 59<P>lvl 56 pet - hits for ?? to 59 kicks for 71<BR>new 56 pet - hits for ?? to 61 kicks for 71<P>lvl 59 pet - hits for ?? to 61<BR>new 59 pet - hits for ?? to 63<P>Since EQ was release the damage of our pets has remained stagnant and was even nerfed, while the damge of the average tank has gone up considerably due to better weapons, more haste gear, etc. The maximum damage that a lvl 49 pet does compared to a spectre pet is a difference of 6 damage.<P>Consider that it takes 2 times as long to get from from lvl 49 to lvl 59 as it does to get from lvl 1 to lvl 49, is it too much to ask to ask that our pets receive a damage upgrade at lvl 53, lvl 56 and lvl 59?<P>Look at the progression of HPS that the following mobs have then compare it to the 2 damage increase of our pets:<P>greater kobold lvl 34 - 1370 HP<BR>lava beetle lvl 42 - 3290 HP<BR>imp protector lvl 48 - 6566 HP<BR>fire giant warrior lvl 51 - 13136 HP<P>The mobs practically double in HPs every few lvls but necromancers are given pets that that only increase by 2 maximum damage. This list of mobs doesn't even include the new SOV uber mobs. Why is it that a lowly lvl 33 spectre in Oasis can hit for 80+ damage, yet my higher level pet only hits for 49?<P><BR>PET BUFFS:<P>-increase the inherent dexterity of our pets or include dexterity as part of the Augment Death pet buff<P>Recently the Verant nerfed our pets by placing them in a PC model from an NPC model. Now as Abashi admitted, our pets have seriously low dexterity and hardly proc at all when using weapons that proc. This change was done as a quick fix for the mages Sword of Runes bug, but it was never changed back after the SOR bug was fixed. For many necromancers that used gnoll<BR>hide lariats and other procing weapons, this change made giving your pet a weapon entirely useless.<P>-pets should benefit from group buffs, many times group buffs are cast by clerics, druids, etc. and pets are never included...why not?<P>-let us target other players pets by pressing the Function key twice, I can select my own pet if I hit F1 twice, why can't I select a groupmates pet by clicking twice on the function key assigned to him?<P>-potions on pets, currently potions can't be used on pets, why?<P>-mages get an extensive line of damage shield that are castable on anyone, necros don't get any damage shields, why?<P>PET FOCUS ITEMS:<P>There is only one in the game, the Encyclopedia Necrothurgia and it drops off a god and is rare as hell. I don't even know a necro on our server that has one or if it has ever dropped. Mages get focus items that they can quest for, why don't necros get them?<P>Perhaps there could be a quest for a focus item that enables the pet to cast disease on the mob. Also there could be one that roots the mob, etc.<P><BR>PET WEAPONS:<P>As the necromancer pet stands now after the dexterity nerf, there is no reason to give a necromancer pet a weapon past lvl 29. It's cosmetic only. I belive that an armed pet *should* do more damage than an unarmed pet. Pets equipped with FS weapons and better should receive a damage bonus or a parrying skill. Giving FS or better weapons to pets is also a great money sink to the game. <P><BR>SPELL UPGRADES:<P>Renew Bones lvl 29 spell is our last pet heal spell max heal 175 HP at lvl 50 for 125 mana, we are supposed to go thru 31 more lvls with no other pet heal spells?<P>-upgrade at lvl 50 called Refresh Bones, max heal 350 for 250 mana<P>Spirit Armor lvl 16 spell, increases AC +14, mana cost 75, we get no upgrade to this<P>-upgrade at lvl 44 to Guard (existing lvl 29 cleric spell which is natural upgrade to Spirit Armor) increases AC + 20, mana 80<P>Screaming Terror lvl 24 spell, stuns target and memblur for 18 secs max, 60 mana<P>-necromancers desperatly need an upgrade to this spell which would help us be more group friendly, Screaming Fright lvl 50 spell, 36 secs duration, 120 mana <P>-upgrade Feign Death lvl 20 spell<P>Shadowknights get a Feign Death upgrade at lvl 60 Death Peace, we should get this spell at lvl 50.<P>-upgrade Invis to Undead, lvl 1 spell<P>Clerics get Sunskin group Invis to Undead at lvl 51, necros to should get this spell at lvl 51. This would enhance our grouping utility.<P>-upgrade Dead Man Floating lvl 44 spell<P>New group DMF spell called Dead Horde Floating, lvl 55. Again, make us group useful.<P><BR>CHANGES TO EXISTING SPELLS:<P>Essence Emerald spell line<P>-make Convergence the lvl 53 necro res that requires an "essence emerald" (which is the result of sacrificing a lvl 47+ player) a purchasable gem.<P>We currently have 3 spells that use the dreaded essence emerald. Nobody I know has ever agreed to be sacrificed or has sacrificed anyone to get these emeralds. In short these 3 spells which require this Convergence (res), Infusion (mana transfer), and Trucidation (lifetap) are never used by 99.9% of necromancers.<P>Essence emeralds should be sold for 500pp at the same vendors that would normally sell coffins. This change would actually make necromancers truly USEFUL and able to res members on a raid etc. Perhaps vendors could sell these in locations in Hate or Fear thus making them difficult to buy like the Tinker bag is in SolA.<P>Summon Corpse spell line<P>-move Conjure Corpse to lvl 51 from lvl 57<P>Shadowknights recently got Summon Corpse at lvl 51, necromancers should get Conjure Corpse at lvl 51. It is way to long to wait till lvl 57 to be able to provide the services of realistic corpse summoning. Regular coffins are too heavy and require there own INV slot, this makes using Summon Corpse completely inpractical for a necromancer below lvl 57. Please change this as it would make our us more desirable in groups/raids.<P>Lich Line of spells:<P>Why do we have 2 lich spells at lvl 60? Please move one of these to lvl 55 and reduce it's effectiveness accordingly.<P>A final note about spell upgrades. Why is it that we seem to get endless upgrades for spells that we never use. Case in point the darkness line of spells (snare). Every necromancer I know uses Dooming Darkness a lvl 29 spell despite the fact that Cascading Darkness a lvl 49 spell and Devouring Darkness lvl 59 spell are available. It is faster to recast and uses less than half the mana.<P><BR>BRING BACK THE FUN SPELLS:<P>When SOV was released our sister class the mages received a line of spells called Monster Summoning. These spells enabled mages to summon new and interesting pets from the NPC models of each zone. Each of these new pets has interesting abilities. These spells have brought back some fun and variation to the mage spell lineup.<P>I think necromancers need a similar lineup of spells. You could have Mummies that cast disease, Ghouls that root, Jack O'Lantern's that stun, Dry & Ice bones that cast, Zombies that stun, etc. what a shame the "masters of the undead (tm)" can't summon these undead beings. These spells would actually inject some fun back into the necromancer class!<P>Summon Dead I - lvl 34 - summons random undead from zone as pet<P>Summon Dead II - lvl 50 - summons random undead from zone as pet<P>Summon Dead III - lvl 60 - summons random undead from zone as pet<P><BR>NEW SPELL WISHLIST:<P>Portal of Tears - lvl 53 - evacs party to spectre island in OOT, dangerous in the fact that party will probably be attacked by spectres upon arrival, also this zone is considered remote, no way to zone out without gate or boat travel<P>Portal of Sand - lvl 60 - evacs party to spectre tower in Oasis, dangerous as well because of spectres on island.<P>Summon Remains - invariably on most raids a corpse will get stuck in a tree or on some unobtainable structure, this spell would summon the corpse of the mob so it can be looted<P>Summon Pet - due to bad pathing or leaving the pet behind, this spell would summon the pet back to it's master<P><BR>Misc:<P>One thing that really puzzles me is why 90% of our spells icons look exactly the same with a skull. Is there any possible way DMF can be changed to the levitate graphic that shamans and druids have? A little imagination would go along way into remedying this problem<P>Finally, I think that the necromancer class was viable when the original EverQuest was released and before the 2 expansions were released. The problem is I see it is that the necromancer was never designed with lvls 51 to lvl 60 in mind. When you consider that lvls 51 to 60 take twice as long as lvls 1 to 50 something is seriously wrong.<P>This isn't a request for more sheer power it's really a plea for the necromancer to be useful in groups and on raids. I'm a lvl 54 necromancer I don't solo anymore because it's boring and there really isn't any place left to solo at my level--therefore grouping is my only option. <P>Nonetheless, to play for over a thousand hours on my necromancer and end up being a "mana feeder" is a sad state of affairs. To always end up in the "oddball" group in raids because you serve no function in a 6 person is depressing. <P>Can I see myself playing my necro for one more year? For 2 more years? Not the way things stand now. The necromancer class post lvl 50 is ill defined and irrelevant to the new reality--where tanks, clerics and enchanters rule the roost because of "mobflation" gone wild in ROK and SOV. To be honest, I love playing my necro.  I don't want to quit but if there are no significant changes and upgrades to my class--I'm outta here. Thank you for listening Absor. I hope you will consider some of my suggestions.<P> Dornette<BR> 54 necromancer<BR> The Nameless<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Necromancer is a WEAK. Until Verant acknowleges this, the class will NEVER be balanced. The only thing the class can do is fear-kite, which is an extremely limited tactic, and, quite frankly, not worth a dime.<P>The necromancer is NOT a PURE CASTER class. It is a hybrid class, only it's much worse off than a melee hybrid. Instead of being able to do a lot of things poorly, the necromancer cannot do ANYTHING AT ALL.<P>Even if ALL of the necromancer's DoTs are 100% IRRESISTABLE, the class would STILL not be able to do HALF the damage of ANY OTHER class in teams. Of course in practice DoTs are pretty much 75+% resisted, especially in Velious.<P>I would like Verant to explain to me exactly how this pathetic hybrid caster is not severely underpowered in teams. Magicians are AT LEAST twice as good as necromancers in teams, and now they get to use their pets against ubermobs too.<P>Quite frankly, I am getting outright sick of asking Verant for SCRAPS, and giving Verant every chance to save face and fix this severely underpowered class at the same time. I am just going to give it to them straight on how to bring the class back into balance.<P>* Touch of Night -- Un-nerfed to be irresistable. It's not like this spell is anywhere NEAR being even REMOTELY efficient at dealing damage. You intended 'Taps to be irresistable and you know it. It already did pathetic amounts of damage contrasted with ALL OTHER DD.<P>* Duck Stick -- Change effect to "Master of the Dead," non-miniature specter illusion, converts 72 HPs to 48 mana per tick. Now that would actually be something worth camping three months for.<P>* Sedulous Subversion -- Improve the mana transfer ratio from 8-to-3 to 8-to-5. Do the freaking math. It's not like we can convert our HPs to mana at an infinite rate, so your better-than-heal-ratio argument is a load of you-know-what.<P>* Emissary of Thule -- Needs to be completely immune to fear, charm, poison, and disease, do 25% more damage, and have 25% better AC, defense, and HPs, critical hits and stuns with kick like warriors, and do not proc to break root.<P>* Summon Pet -- Give it to necromancers too. IT'S YOUR OWN FREAKING FAULT THAT MOVING PETS AROUND IS SO SCREWED UP IN DUNGEONS. Since you obviously cannot get pets to work right in dungeons, you need to give all classes with pets spells to get around YOUR INABILITY TO MAKE IT WORK PROPERLY.<P>* DoTs -- ALL DoTs needs to do three times the damage per tick of what they currently do, and have their durations cut to one third. DoT was a decent idea which simply was never implemented correctly. You people need to stop doing all your balance tests in Skyfire and wave your nerf sticks based on those tests.<P>* Screaming Terror -- Change it back to what it was. I know you people have trouble getting "linked save" multiple-effect spells' multiple effects to go off in the order you want them to, so just MAKE THE FEAR COMPONENT OF THIS SPELL NON-AGGRO. I am SICK of looking at the nerfed-mesmerize version of this spell. In a sense, this epitomizes the necromancer class: If &lt;insert a class here, any class&gt; is Dazzle, then the necromancer is Screaming Terror.<P>LOOK AT THE TEAM POWER OF THE OTHER CLASSES, then look me in the eye and tell me that there is not a SEVERE imbalance there. The power gaps between classes are FAR GREATER in team than they EVER are in solo. This is a TEAM game, and all the POWERGAMING are done in teams. That's why TEAM BALANCE is what you should be LOOKING AT. Even at lower levels the "non-solo" classes are overpowered, especially now that previously incredible gears are dirty-common.<P>STOP DUMBING DOWN THE GAME! Why do you insist on making the end game nine teams of CLERICS and WARRIORS plus one team of utility? Why can't non-wizards do ANY spell damage AT ALL? Hell if making classes impotent to frustrate players is your cup of tea, then why not make the dragons immune to non-rogue melee damage too?<P>I mean GEEZ, that's exactly what you are doing to the non-wizard pure casters. I can understand cutting a class's power by 50% even, but this is one class that is NINETY-FIVE PERCENT NEUTRALIZED in your grand scheme of things. STOP ACTING AS IF THE NECROMANCER IS STILL A GOOD CLASS. No class can take twelve MAJOR NERFS and come out "still good." It's time to do some SERIOUS MENDING and give the necromancer back A LOT OF WELL-DESERVED POWER WHICH SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN LOST IN THE FIRST PLACE.<P>Enough said.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Very nice post Dornette. I like your ideas, and as you said, they do not add any overpowering abilities to the class, yet they do increase their usefullness. <P>Sad to say though, I think Absor washed his hands of this thread a couple splits back.

</FONT><HR>Verant's New Necromancer:<P>* Downgraded from a "pet class" to a "secondary pet class," even though necromancers cannot even do half the damage magicians can in teams (Master of Elements can rip through 3.5 Emissaries of Thule...and...appears to be 99% resistant to the duck stick! Hmm!).<P>* The necromancer's only function on raids is giving a free 6.77 mana per tick to ONE cleric. Verant "feels comfortable" with this role change (Wow, 6.77 extra free mana for ONE cleric on top of Clarity II's 11 extra free mana for everybody? POW WOW, Bard me a river!).<P>* New mobs are now 95+% resistant to disease, poison, AND magic. I suppose it's a good thing that necromancers can still Pyrocuror at 50% resist rate (doing 222 damage for 400 mana before the mob drops dead to Jade Maces and 1024 damage for 320 mana DDs).<P>Well I suppose you got overwhelming "Very Dissatisfied" rating on your survey from the casters no? Yeah it was real fun to see my mez and all my damage spell lines completely disabled. You even managed to "get" my enchanter too. Half of my guild are starting over as cleric or warrior. I guess you finally have the lack of vision you wanted with Velious.<P>Did I mention 99.99% of uber drops in Velious were melee gear? Oh wait, now I'm getting off-topic. I suppose general dissatisfaction with the state of the game isn't the issue here. God I can't believe I'm starting to miss Abashi's posts now. For all his PRness, the man actually had an inkling of a clue.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One little quick question.<P>I don't understand how spells are coded.  Why is it required to have 2 resist checks on a spell with 2 effects?<P>Why not simply check for resist, and if resist fails, apply the necessary conditions.<P>The ignite bones thing above is a perfect example.  Used to be a 10 sec stun?  COOl!!  but why check once for damage, and once for stun?  Especially if either fails, the whole spell bounces?  If the Checks are seperate, then so should the results apply seperatly.  Ie, mob fails damage resist, and takes the damage, but made resist on the stun, and is not stunned.<P>Is this why Darkness bounces like a rubber ball, even off of greens at times?  I don't remember the last time a MoB higher than I cast a spell that I resisted, I think it is nearly impossible.  Yet Greens can bounce our spells with ease?<P>Simple solution to Necromancers--Give us back our power.  What is the difference between 40 level 10 necromancers taking down a Hill giant, and 40 level 55+ Pc's taking down Dragons?  This is no longer a balance issue, given the Raid nature of the game.<P>We pay for advantages we no longer recieve.  Our Taps do horrible damage compared to other damage casters.  The advantage was supposed to be becuase they were irresistable.  At least make it so at level 45+ Our lifetaps are irresistable again.  That is the level we begin to raid again. <P>And please, the improvements considered for mages may be more appropriate for necromancers.. Hello, imunity to fear!!  We should be able to cast that on PC's, not just pets.<P><BR>As a bounus to Groupablity, make Necro Buffs castable on at least party, if not any target.  We get some very usefull buffs, at the level they are recieverd, but /gasp  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/eek.gif">  we are a casting class, not a tank.  If you do this, please 1}un-nerf the SK buffs and 2} don't nerf ours.  we have been hit with the nerf stick enough.<P>--Necridious<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have to admit I am a "newbie" - first character (and the only one thus far) is a 34 necro. So obviously I haven't got the vast experience of most of the posters here. Still here's my 2cp worth :<P>Pets - another nerf of pets would be ludicrous. I don't want a pet that is better or even as good as a mage one, but I would like one that is effective and also responds to commands just a little better.<P>Screaming Terror - wouldn't it be nice if it actually did what it originally was intended to do? Makes us more useful in dungeon groups certainly - and with the aggro wipe functioning means we won't have to keep feigning every time it breaks....<P>Necros role as mana batteries - nay, nay and thrice more nay. If I wanted to play a battery I'd play a chanter. Sorry, I want to be a necro and I understand that the trade off for my solo ability is that I'm a weak group member. But surely you can't nerf our soloing ability and STILL expect us to be happy with our current lacklustre group performance.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm in full agreement. The subversion line was a slap in the face - an attempt to appease necros after nerfing them. (While hiding it under the guise of making necromancers "group friendly". Our un-nerfed pets were much more "group friendly", tyvm.)<P>Not only was subversion a slap in the face ("You can't do anything with your own mana, so give it to someone else."), but it was really poorly thought out.<P>The developers who afflicted us with this blight not only gave it a -horrible- ratio, but an obscenely long cast time. <P>Just a small example: I'm level 59, and I've got some very nice gear. According to the Caster's Realm manacalc (Which seems to be fairly correct) I have 3,112 mana.<P>Working on an obviously exaggerated assumption that specialize will -always- work, and reduce mana consumption by 20%, each time, I could go from FM to "Not enough mana to cast this spell" in 9 casts of Sedulous Subversion. (The ninth comes with the assumption that I could med back enough mana for a last cast while sitting between casts.)<P>The kicker? This would take me ~100 seconds. (3 second cast time, 8 second recast - with at least 1 second between casts due to lag.)<P>This spell is worthless, just remove it. Let necromancers resume their role of doing damage, even if they're a joke compared to rogues.<P>-Daethe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You know regardless what is done to the class, on large raids we will always be relagated to the manastone roll because of ability to transfer mana. No matter if I actually damage the  mob my part is never figured in as my mana is always going to a cleric or a chanter. This entire spell line is a curse. As Abashi said necro's should have to pay. Well besided the monthly fee we pay each raid with sedulous subversion. And now that I'm 60 I raid exclusively. <P>Also wheres the caster gear in Kurnak and SoV?<BR>We kill alot of dragons and other big mobs and I have yet to see a regular drop of a purely caster item. All the while melee and wisdom casters are getting all the toys. I'm starting to get very bored of watching all the melee and wisdom guys roll on stuff while we int chasters are left sitting there.<P>My epic isn't valuable to the guild so getting one will be awhile since the places the drops are from we hardly go to. All the while I see every cleric , enchanter, rogue, monk, shaman with theirs. We even have mages with theirs but no cape drop when we went there for me. Poor Wizards have it bad. If your gonna do epic drops why can't they drop more than 1/100th? Doesn't killing the mob entitle you to an epic part? Move all epic parts that are in the Planes of Fear, Hate and Sky to part of the game thats equally as hard but at least doable. Being that alot of guilds kill fear and hate those with drops here are left waiting and hopeing when they actually do the plane their item will drop. <P>Oh yeah did I mention Demi Lich already is a very dangerous spell, so nerfing the lich line will just make all future necro's ,if there is any, to be required to be an Iksar. I already have to start alot of fights with under half health and on these new quad hitting super fast mobs that in and of its self should be payment enough. On raids where I can't tap anything I put an extra burden on the cleric now that I hit 60 with this spell. Maybe I just need to learn how to better juggle it a little? Absor play me sometime on a raid see that even when I can do damage I'm oom from mana dumping another class and you never hear "Necro's mana?" unless its when someone needs some of it. This is all great when its an emergency but its all I hear nowadays. Do this day in and day out of your playing time see how much fun it is.<P>I'm so frustrated, the class I love is being literally nerfed out of existance. We've been nerfed so much since release while everyone else  has gotten enhancements. I'm sorry but the subversion line and our debuffs didn't make up for the dagger delay nerf. We are a pet class too!! Main pet classes mage AND necro. Secondary Pet classes Shamans and Enchanters. We dont' fit in the later but our pets sure do. We can never get anything added without a nerf. We aren't the best soloing anymore. My main power is the fear spell. That spell alone makes my pets at 50+ look good cause they sure can't tank.<P>My brother in law recently quit the game becuase he couldn't get into a guild to do stuff because he was a 51 necro, now if he was a cleric, enchanter, rogue, bard, warrior, wizard he'd been in for sure. We have 2 full time and 2 part time necros already more than enough for any large guild.<P>I feel like this is a death bed cry for help. People who play necro's 1-50 love the class and some stick with it till the end (51-60) but alot quit when they see our raid role. <P>My guild leader said necro's are sorely lacking and need some major improvements. A mage friend of mine said necro pets need alot of work. When you look past the trolls that post on this board you will see a class that has been nerfed one too many times, has no real use that couldn't be done by a twink logged at the zone line on a raid, thats fun yet no fun in the end where it should be still because Verant has consistantly taken away from it.<P><BR>Wisbick<BR>Warlock manastone extroardinaire(sp)and depressed necro.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The issue is deeper than fixing a spell line. But for the short on attention span:<P>Add a line of spells post 50. Tap-like, but with the original (low) mob resistances, on par with other casters' post 50 DDs in damage but reduced, to balance the healing aspect. Make it break any player cast fear and/or darkness. Instant duration, no lasting effects (besides fear/dark beak), so multi-necros can cast it simultaneously.<P>Now Necros can DD, and do some heal support (NOT MANA!!!) without any enhancement to their soloing ability.<P><BR>The deeper issues are:<BR>- Defining the role of the class post 50.<BR>- Rigid mid set regarding the Neco's relative power.<P>Definition: The public gets this, and only this that I could find:<BR>"Necromancers:<BR>   These are the dark brotherhood of the arcane arts, dabbling in death. Through evil spiritually based spells, they are able to animate dead bodies and skeletons to do their bidding, as well as having spells which leach life from their victims"<BR>-http://everquest.station.sony.com/guides/classes/necromancer.jsp<P>Set aside the fact that it seems we Necros are meant to be the only class that has a major group-role change after around 55th. I like the concept of the challenge of changing from a damage dealer to a support class. Makes me a better player than I was because I have to adapt. The problem is the re-definition didn't get enabled. The other problem is I don't want to HAVE to change my role without knowing I would ahead of time.<P>So, when the Dev team looks at Necros, what is the "class definition" they look at to determine if it 'fits'. Every project's products have definitions. These can evolve, but there should still be some. What is Verant's Necro definition? What is the base class definition that the Dev team refers to when making class balance choices? I'm suspecting there isn't one. And I mean available to the Dev team.<P>I grudgingly accept that the Necro is being re-defined post 55. Please tell me the definition that will be reshaping my class. Perhaps then the Necro community can make suggestion that fit better. We can also decide if that's the PC we wanted to play. Set the new Necro standard, then enable it. If I am to morph into a support class, then give me support spells. Four (manastone line, pact line, DMF, ST) isn't enough. I have got to say this now: I don't want to be a support class! However, if I am to be made one, make me effective.<P><BR>Support this quote "...the necromancer is a pretty powerful class as they are now." Compared to? In what situations? More powerful than all the other classes, as this statement implies to me?<P>"...we will be looking closely at this class we may very well feel that something needs to have its power reduced to achieve balance." Any other class have this qualifier in the opening class remarks? Druids maybe?<P>There will be no "balance" as long as the mind-set it what it is. When Verant reps tell everyone this, they believe it. When Verant reps say this enough, they themselves believe unthinkingly. What's happened is that the perception is Necro's are over-powered. It's been thoroughly ingrained in the EQ community, and with the Verant Staff. They may have been at one time, I don't know. I haven't played a Necro since [insert some date before Gordon was born] so I wouldn't know from personal experience. I do know that I was just as full of the "Necros are gods" mind-set as everyone from shortly after release (4/99 ?) thru Kunark as I played a Ranger. I started playing an Iksar Necro and learned:<BR>- I could solo by 'tanking' with my pet at low levels. And continued to be able to solo via fear-kite soon as I got fear.<BR>-- Necros are _not_ gods.<BR>--- Soloing is boring and in-efficient, even pre-group-exp-enhancement.<P>I have yet to experience how Necros are overpowered in any general way. Give examples of how good we are at doing exactly what we were designed to do - fear kite- and it may seem overpowering. Set aside that fear-kiting takes specific circumstances to be do-able. Also set aside that Necros are not the only class, or the best class, at fear-kiting. Telling Necros they are overpowered because of this is like telling Clerics they are overpowered because they can keep a group alive by healing them.<P>So, Absor and like minded people, what am I doing wrong? Why am I not the god-ling we are made out to be? "...pretty powerful..." "...looking closely at this class..." "...power reduced...". If Necros have 'pretty' as a power rating, what is the Wizard rating? Druid? Cleric? I want to hear from the Dev Team, or any player who KNOWS (not regurgitations of the false mind-set) what is it that makes Necros so powerful so I can start doing it. I want to have the ability I am being punished for.<P>What I really want is for the Dev team to drop the Necros are already god-lings attitude and give us a fair comparison to the way things are now.<P>-=Reptanis<P>PS. Some thought to add to the undead faction idea that pops up now and again. Not to be insulting, but I had to comment because it makes no sense.<BR>Rangers are 'friendly' to bears and wolves because they live in harmony with nature and respect life. (untill a Player gets a hold of one  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>Necro's should NEVER be other than KoS to undead. What makes you think SLAVES would be anything but hateful to their enslaver? Necros aren't buddy-buddy with undead, we use and abuse them. We dominate their will and BEND it to our own. We summon them from the peaceful bliss of death, only to thrust them into the thick of violence. We have finely tuned our magic with spells of extreme efficiency in destroying undead. Why was it you think undead should be other than KoS to Necros (and not others I might add)?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, please look at for Necromancers on Red servers. <P>When fighting someone like a Wizard for instance, he can cast his DD without the chances of it not being removed like DoTs. Let me please this explain in depth. Assume that the Wizard is 52, he would have Manaskin on and wearing some form of resist. Ok Im using Manaskin and Shield of the Magi and the resist gear that applies. The fight will go like this (no pet would be cast Ill explain later), Splurt, EB, BoD, and Harmshield. The Wizard will me IC twice followed by chain casting Draught of Fire.<P>Now lets assume that I resisted of the one IC with my gear and the other hit for less damage because of Manakin. If I chain cast Deflux (depending if I removed his Manaskin first) just I will end up not being able to loot if I win. Since the DoT are slow, he has the chance to either/or flee, Pumice off Splurt, and cure his Poison with a potion.   Out of those three options only one takes mana. Pumice and a cure Poison potion requires no mana period. Here are my options if the Wizard was getting the best of me. Flee by Gate/Shadow Step/Levant, Harmshield, or try to zone. All but zoning requires mana. Most pkers carries potions that allow them to cure whichever DoT is on them. <P>Im not saying thats wrong or anything because even though it requires mana I can cast a Lifetap. If someone dies from some form of magic DoT, Lifetap, and pet then I cannot loot which makes my spell selection much tougher. I never use a pet while fighting classes without a pet because I dont want the pet getting a chance of getting the killing blow (Mages run into this same problem). <P>This is what I like to have fixed for Necromancers on Red servers.<P>A) Allow us to be able to loot from magic DoTs and/or Lifetap kills.<BR>B) Allow us to be able to loot if our pet gets the kill. ( GO Gober GO)<P>DoTs are slow enough, we dont need anymore restrictions please. We are not the one shot one kill wonders like Wizards and SKs are.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A quote from Absor:<BR>"Also, we are not looking to make necromancers any more effective at soloing than they already are. And, well, the necromancer is a pretty powerful class as they are now."<P><BR>I have posted here two times already, but I want to stress my point one more time, for the sake of emphasis.<P>I agree totally with the fact of not making Necromancers more powerful at soloing. Yet I think there is an overall misconception of the difference in power between the classes with respect to soloing. Comparing two ends of the spectrum, Warrior and Necromancer. A 16th level Warrior wouldn't dream of soloing a yellow mob. While a 16th level Necromancer could pull it off with relative ease. So the 16th lvl warrior solos blue mobs. He does so at a much faster rate than the necro soloing yellow mobs. Why, because the necro will use up on average 4 bubs of mana during the battle, and then have to med for awhile. The warrior can take on 4 blue mobs in the same amount of time and lose probaby 2 bubs of health. Net result, same xp roughly for both. Where the Necro edges out the Warrior in ease of soloing is the travel to and from the hunting grounds. The warrior is always exposed, the Necro, can be invis the whole way and mostly unmolested. Is that way more powerful? Not really, considering most casters can do the same when it comes to travel, some have it much better (Druids). All of that notwithstanding, I agree not to increase the viability of soloing.<P>Which brings me to my second point. Are Necros "pretty powerful" in groups? I think not. Why? Even at the lower levels we are virtually useless. We can sick pet, and snare. Is our pet as good as a Mage's? HA! Not in any way shape or form. Our darkness spells are not as good of a snare as a Druid's until 29th level when we get dooming. What about our wonderful DOT's? Utterly useless. A DOT on a mob in a good group that takes two minutes to do it's total damage to a mob that is probably dead in 30 seconds. As useful as a tit on a boar. Fear kiting? Well now this would be one place we could rock. But unless you are in a group that is in an outdoor flat area, and that isn't totally resistant to the idea, it would make us a very valuable member. How often does that happen? For me, once in 30 levels. <P>Where is this conceived sense of being "pretty powerful" coming from? I have read where some people want to nerf the pet's from 1-40. Are you crazy? Why? To justify your pet's getting power increases because you are post 50? How is that helping the class? It isn't. That pet is as much of a bane as it is a benefit. You cannot survive without it, yet at times at can be the source of your doom. They are useless in dungeons, and therefore, what good are you as a Necro in a dungeon? ZIP.<P>Since most of the people posting here have addressed the post 50 concerns (albeit some ideas haven't been all that great), I am addressing pre-50 concerns. Make us wanted in groups! Make our DOTS fast acting. Decrease the duration to 42 seconds, keep damage the same and increase mana by 1/3. In conjuction with this, make them landable on uber mobs, and fix corpse poofing due to DOTs. Give the post-50 a wider selection of DOTs so that on a raid you can have multiple necros, each using a different DOT on the mob.<P>Fix the pathing problem with pets in dungeons, or give us something with which to summon the pet back to us. Then if the pet was in trouble when it was summoned, a FD will clear it's hate list as well as yours. And make pet's of a certain level immune to fear, unless it is an undead fear. In fact, one way to implement a small nerf to all casters who can fear is to make ALL undead immune to fear except for the undead only fear spells.<P>And don't touch the Lich line of spells. There is already plenty of risk involved with the reward received.<P>Troy<BR>Owner of a 30th level Iksar Necro that has been shelved indefinitely until I see where this class is going.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
