</FONT><HR>You can read the previous discussion here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053175.html<P><BR>Author  Topic:   Aradune, you have lost touch with the player base.  <BR>Bogmog<BR>Station Member   posted 01-30-2001 12:54 PM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>This is not a cry about the Donal's Breastplate nerfing, this is not a call to get it undone. The Donal's breastplate issue has merely shed a light on a long developing problem. Mudflation - you know the term, you know the syndrome. Please take a step back and look at the history of the bleeding edge of EQ.<BR>The battle between the developers to challenge the elite players and the elite players to "beat" the game in EQ has been a long one. It's really been happening since the very beginning, but started to get heated when the first big guilds begain to kill the dragons regularly. Initially, only a tiny, tiny amount of guilds on any server were able to kill dragons - the results were twofold. First, these guilds ended up harvesting the dragons regularly, having minimal competition, and as such because more than well equipped with loot that was above and beyond anything available to the rest of the populace. Second, the better equipped they got, the better tactically they got, the stronger the dragons were made. The "bar" started to get raised for these people, yet the rest of the population was NOT rising as fastly - only those capable of killing the dragons were doing so, and only they were starting to equip themselves with the items that were making them powerful enough to justify the increased difficulty of the dragons.<P>Then the planes open, and the spark of mudflation that started with the dragons exploded on both fronts. Fear (later Hate), a vast new zone of such difficulty that it challenged those already boosted far above their lesser brethren with the loot won from dragons, but also filled with loot of astounding potence, making the dragon stuff look like junk in comparison. Soon, the same guilds that were harvesting the dragons were now harvesting planar armor and equipment, god loot at the time almost unimagineably good. These guilds buried themselves in the bounty, not just themselves but their alts/twinkies/mules... Those that couldn't, which was pretty much all but one to three guilds per server, weren't... The mighty got mightier, the devs responded, killed drop rates AND made the planes more difficult. And more so.. and more so... and the drop rates got lower.. and lower.. Those who were there first, already a class above the rest of the populace due to their hordes of dragon loot were now even further ahead, bedecked in full planar gear. <P>In time, many many more guilds became strong enough to kill the dragons, venture into the planes, but it was not the same.. dragons were tougher, rather than one guild dominating every spawn, or two or three battling over them, it was many, many guilds fighting over two dragons. The planes were not the same places.. those who were there first still dominated and swept them at will, the rest were stuck bickering with eachother over the scraps, scraps coincidentally which were far tougher to kill than what the initial plane pioneers faced and far poorer in reward than they once were. The elite first ones were decked down to their mules in full or near full suits of planar armor, only needing to harvest more as new members joined, or new alts were born, the rest were struggling to get entire guilds full of people a scrap or two of the planar goodies... It was ugly..<P>Then Kunark came out.. and the promises had us all excited - a handfull of new dragons, not just the two old perpertually slaughtered duo of Nagafen and Vox.. whole zones for the 40+ crowd to play in.. but what do we see? The new dragons are so powerful only the initial harvesters of vox/nag and the planes had a chance to kill them - new, wonderful armors and equipment, but the prize pieces, the breastplates and leggings, where were they.. Trakanon and Venril Sathir... and to whom were they available.. drumroll.. the same people who were there to first harvest vox and nagafen, that small small percentage of the populace in that small small subset of guilds. This was where the mudflation had gotten out of hand, where the barrier between the haves and the have not finally cemented itself. To this date, how many guilds per server have killed Trakanon, how many have killed Venril Sathir? Short of ebay and the VERY RARE trade, this same number is the number of guilds who have obtained Donal's breastplates, or other such Kunark right clickable class armor breastplates. And this is what, TEN months after Kunark's release? Let's not even mention Veeshan's peak..<P>Now we have Velious - while Kunark was a bandaid for overcrowding, the factions an utter mess (Venril Sathir faction? jeez.. what a horrible mess, where was that deep storyline it was supposed to be a part of), the quest content largely empty and/or broken, the zones well.. sloppy, and incoherent, without a finished feel, many dungeons still devoid of players.. well, while Kunark was a bandaid, Velious was obviously designed with love - deep, interesting, rewarding quests, a beautiful (at surface) faction triangle with a storyline behind it... but it was not designed with the average player in mind. The faction triangle while initially accessible to the majority of players hits a wall when you get to the royal factions - the quests available to the average player, well, what few raise tormax or yelinak faction do so minimally - given that we start at scowls the quests might as well not even give faction, they won't be of use. How do we raise faction with the royal factions of Kael, the Dragons? Easy.. kill the royals of their enemies - who can do such things? Ding! Only that tiny tiny subset of guilds who have been on top from the beginning (though they might have changed faces, names, reformed and redistributed the players among them, it's still that same small handful of people at the heart). The rest of us? Out of the loop, scrounging for scraps in Great Divide and Eastern Wastes... And what about all those wonderful zones for high level players? Well, they're only for high level players who can get through Siren's Grotto.. and those high level players well.. ding, you got it, back to the same handfull of guilds per server..<P>Finally we get to the heart of this Donal's breastplate thing... You finally admit that you are designing content around this one item, granted as per your admission, only a handfull of boss mobs were specifically made with this in mind, but it's time you look at all of velious, all top level content, and look in a mirror and ask yourself, really, who are you designing it for? There are a LOT of players level 50+, but is this 50+ content designed for them? I say the answer is clearly no, it is designed for only what amounts to an aristocratic minority of them, a miniscule subset who, while outstanding in their accomplishments is a tiny, tiny, tiny percentage of the whole population.<P>This is not an attack on uberguilds - they are not some evil organization out to get the rest of the player population, they are people, just like the rest of the player base, people, players who take what has been layed out before them, and use the tools that they have earned to take advantage of it. It is not their fault that the content is skewed in their favor, they don't make the content, they just play the game.<P>The problem here lies clearly with you, the designers. You seem to have blinded yourselves to the actual makeup of the player base. I don't know why it has happened, but that it has happened is painfully clear. If anyone Brad, given your long history and well respected knowledge in the arena of MUD type games, you should have been aware of the threat of mudflation, prepared for it, but clearly somehow, some way, Everquest has truly fallen victim to it. Get a grip on the problem, and throttle it, get back in touch with those of us who play the game. Not just the few lucky ones who figured things out at the beginning, organized themselves well enough to consistently stand at the pinnacle of success in the game, but the rest of us, who, less organized, less driven, have been basically struggling along, wallowing in the wake of the bleeding edge elite created by your efforts to challenge them without sight of or consideration for the rest of us. Retune, revamp the 50+ content for the average 50+ player, group, guild, disorganized band of ruffians, whatever they may be, not the elite. If they win, if they "beat" the content you created, good for them - it's not a defeat for you, the more happy players you have the more you win, content which only a small subset of the population will ever truly enjoy is not a victory, it's a defeat, a loss of vision. Get back in touch with us, please.<BR> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The blue names have already responded to this issue... it is the game you are playing.  They have continued to inflate thier MUD to the point that they designed an entire expansion around a single breastplate.<P>The core problem is how do you add new content that is exciting?  If they add a new L35 zone it is mapped in a matter of days (hours?).  They need to add new content that is going to last a while so it is targeted at the "best" players on the servers.<P>If all things can be done by a "good" group of 6, then a "good" group of 12 will have no problem doing everyting much faster and your content doesn't remain interesting for very long.<P>How would you (the players) go about fixing this?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Very well said. <P>Being a casual player, I feel like the red-headed step-child of EQ. <P>The ENTIRE game is geared to those who have no life outside of EQ. <P>Specifically, the quests (why I started playing the game) are geared towards the players that can spend 10-12 hours at a time camping a specific spawn (Raster camp for monks). There is typically no alternate path for casual players. <P>Instead of a quest that requires 100 hours camping 3 spawns (yes of course we know you figure that into the quest), create alternate paths that would be 20 camps of 5 hours (or 50 camps of 2 hours, whatever). <P>With the final touches of the product in development now, this will not occur. The next game that gets this right will draw the casual players away from EQ and you will be left with nothing but the uber-players that you seem to cater to.<P>For those casual players reading this, I suggest you go to the web site http://www.darkageofcamelot.com. It looks like they are looking out for the casual gamers in their design.<P>Kurrlee</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Very well done post, and I have to say I agree. Velious was almost made with a Warrior and a Cleric donning Donalds BP in mind. They changed the entire post 50 game to be Warrior take the beating, and cleric Cheal the damage. <P>They only let Wizzards think they are usefull by letting them be the only ones that can cast on the mobs with thier lure line. But then they up the HP so that thier mana won't keep up. <P>Sure other melee can damage the mobs, and casters can buff the tanks. But it shows how VI has overall lost touch with the majority of players, and why they enjoy playing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Brad has already said his company makes more money off of casual gamers---since we play less than the powergamers, yet pay the same fees. In effect, the casual gamer is funding the economic environment necessary for the uber-guild/powergamer game. They can't exist without us.<P>Rather than address the casual gamer's needs/wants--the LT chooses to ignore us and focus all their efforts on the uber players. Even the recent poll by Abashi about the Velious zones calls on the opinions of this elite group.<P>Why? It's my opinion Verant sees no other option. They need to retain their subscribers. Providing even more high-end content/difficulty addresses the needs of those players who can and, obviously, will spend insane amounts of time on this game. The casual gamer stays in mid-levels far longer and the current difficulty/content is, VI believes, sufficient. By the time the 'lower class' gets to the Uber Class level, the content/diffculty will be so extreme we'll either quit in disgust or slave away indefinitely to try to 'succeed'.<P>All this is my opinion, of course--since I don't work for VI and am not privy to their business plans.<P>Think about this: the Uber players have succeeded against everything the original Dev Team and the Live Team have contrived. Everything! This, despite all the bugs, imbalances, and mediocrity we've been complaining about since day one. If you worked on the Live Team (LT) for this game, what would this tell you? What would your assessment of all our complaints/whines be---in the face of this obvious contradiction?<P>Yet, I see no solution. The basic, fundamental gameplay of Everquest will not support any radical change. The game is made so we (casual and power gamer alike)must group, camp endlessly in order to advance. There is no other worthwhile activity. You know I've said this over and over again: no story, no theme, no plot. Players don't even bother trying to interact with any of the current 'plots' put forth by the LT. We all know why: they're meaningless and worthless taken in the context of the reality of gameplay. Another way of saying this: they contribute nothing to character advancement, they do not alter the environment in any fashion whatsoever.<P>It says a great deal about a fantasy RPG when the players actively refuse to interact with the plot/story/theme (such as they are). It says that even the most fundamental errors gamemasters discovered from the Table-Top RPG era were proactively ignored by Verant Interactive when they designed the basic concepts of this game. Any experienced, half-way competent Gamemaster could've warned the Dev Team about all of this.<P>As an example: competent Gamemasters KNOW that linear campaigns (adventures, modules--etc) are doomed to failure. They know that constraining players of any caliber to a rigid, drawn-out, line-by-line adventure means the players will defy it to their utmost. Yet, in the face of this fact, the LT designs an entirely new continent based on this disasterous concept. It's pitiable, actually. And somewhat insulting. Evidentally the LT is so full of themselves they feel no need to accept advice from experienced GMs. Or, they were well aware of this and simply had no other option but to do it anyway in order to ensure continued subscriptions.<P>Either way, this means the end result is medocrity and continued class balance/envy whines. No story, no plot, no theme means any and every aspect of gameplay is viewed as merely arbitrary---a decision by some yahoo on the LT which could've gone another way entirely based on a whim. Therefore, these complaints and whines will never go away. Therefore, VI will never be 'in touch' with the player base.<P>thanks and sorry for the spam<P>Alcarian</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't think it's as hopeless or bleak as many do, I really think the problem is that the live team has been really concentrating so heavily on "beating" this very small and unrepresentative segment of the population that they've developed tunnel vision, really losing sight of what the effects are on the game as a whole.  There IS a good game here, but because of the myopic focus on challenging the best of the best, it's out of reach to the rest...<P>Think about it, four or five of the great monsters/personae of Velious, were specifically tuned for one item, Donal's breastplate, challenging those with it, and making them all but invincible for those without.  How many are there per server?  5 or so max? Spread out among how many guilds? One, two, three?  It's a disasterous mess.  To just say, well that's the way it is, is to do the game, and ALL of those who play it a great disservice.  If the developers/live team cannot, will not look at themselves in the mirror, face up to their mistakes, be wary of making them again in the future, AND try to undo those they've already made, well, they're really doing themselves a service in the long run.  The game is not beyond hope, the question is, will the developers right what has gone wrong.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This has surely been an interesting discussion.  I came to EQ late, with my first character started in October now L44, and various secondaries ranging up to L21.  First let me state the obvious, we wouldn't all be here griping, or reading other's gripes, unless we all felt that the game was something special.<P>So, as I understand the problem, as it was so cogently explained above, th euber guilds, because of their uber status, get greater access to, and ownership of the uber gear, thereby becoming even more uber.  As a result of this item creep, the latecomers are left eating the dust.<P>Well, to a great degree I can agree in principle with this point, and I can sympathize with both parties, the regular players who feel cheated out of the great gear, and the ubers who want to keep at the challenges.  My guild, good though I think it is, is definitely not uber;  we have helped in Vox raids and those qualified have made it to the planes.  <P>Here is a suggestion, assuming that it could work within the game mechanics.  As things stand, it is possible for lower (46 for the planes) and upper (53 for Vox) caps to be used in specific circumstances.  Why not exptend the idea of caps and floors to all the dungeons?  Then it would be impossible for an uber guild to farm the better items available in lower level areas.  Couple this with level floors for most of the truly uber peices of equipment, to preent abusive twinking, and even consider a floor on MOBs being affected by spells and effects, ("Decaying Skeleton resists your Envenomed Bolt"), and it might be posible to reintroduce balance into the game.<P>Just a thought.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Mob floors...AKKK!<P>First of all, as a necro who regularly needs to collect bones I am offended by your suggestion that they be made immune to me ("Oh Mr 2nd level person, here is 50 platt..will you please go kill some skeletons for me I cannot seem to kill them anymore")<P>This would destroy (or further destroy)the realism of the game, as would lower level dungeon limits. ("I am sorry mr level 15, I cant help you rescue you corpse from befallen. It has befallen and can't get up")<P>Farming as a problem needs to be dealt with differently IMNSHO. A large part of it is twinking, which should be dealt with by level limits ("Ouch! That planar item is too powerful for me! I am only level 4!!")</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>    Excellent post.  Simple idea that will never be implemented.  Faction for ubermobs and dragons.  Kill a dragon, wreck your faction.  Until you fix your faction you get booted just like the lvl cap.  It will never happen but it would go a long way towards giving all a shot at taking down that ubermob and leaving them "unfarmed".</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have let this post simmer in my mind for several days now.  I would like to see a response, if nothing other than, 'we have noted your comments'.  I have left and came back to EQ several times now(never cancelled, just didn't play).  The direction of the game had been (is?) totally geared to the 'uber', which has been my major issue.  The latest 'change' in direction, (i.e., the change in hybrid experience, etc.) brought me back once again.  HOWEVER, I, like many others bought the Velious expansion and I am very disappointed that I will probably NEVER see almost 50% of it because I am not in an 'uber' guild.  I implore Verant to respond to this thread and at least acknowledge its existence and the outcry of what is ...  most likely...  the majority of your customer base.<P>Thank you<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Interesting point of view, I like it.  I agree, many of the weapons/armor/whatever that are wonder weapons are exceedingly hard to get.  I also see another point lurking just behind your main point, but not actually covered. Why is there such a large divide between the amazing equipment and what everyone else is using?  <P>Heres something to think about, go to a EQ website like allakhazam or casters realm, and do a search on equipment based on a stat.  You should notice that many of the items are 45+ drop, and give around 5 different stat bonus's.  Either that, or they're low level, low single or double stat.  I find if I'm looking for decent equip, I keep going back to the jeweling charts, but those only cover 8 of around 30 slots.  <P>another thing of note on these sites, weapon dmg/dly ratios go from 1/4 for lvl 20, 1/3 for 40, and 1/2 for 50.  problem is, after 30, most 1/4 ratios are to low for the amount of hp a monster has, 1/3 is just below effective at 30, but your supposed to use them at 40 to 50. This is why tanks have such a problem until they get that wurmlslayer or jade mace.  <P>What seems to be happening, is the focus goes toward bigger bonus's, higher levels.  Better balanced stuff leans toward things like bone plated arms, which have a bonus to int, but detract from stamina (i think, you get the idea tho). these kinds of items would be excellent for mid ranges, where you can't get high stat items.  <P>lastly, while i do agree that the twinky guilds of 50+ are the guilds that have to much control over the good stuff, These are the people who have beaten the game as well.  What kind of reward do you want when you beat the game? I think it should be to do anything you want. its not like you can do much else.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055085-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055085-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055085-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055085&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055085&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
