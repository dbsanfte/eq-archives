</FONT><HR>What I descovered while taking a vacation from EQ?<P>Well I started off my vaction by trying to catch a taxi out of town, after a while of trying to hail a cab, I finnally got one and got a ride to the ferries out of town, of course I had missed the boat, so I waited for the next one, sitting down at the docks reading a book, that I had read before, the next boat was late of course. when I finnally arrived at my destination, me and my friends went hunting, where we got totally lost and never found what we we hunting for. when wew were done this i went to return home, i missed the boat again so ended up reading the same stupid book while waiting  for the boat again, of course as always it was late. then I spent awhile trying to get a taxi ride back into town.<P>What did i learn from all this, i learnt that i could have done much the same stuff sitting comfortable in front of my computer playing EQ.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

You win. We are wrong and you have shown us the error of our ways.

</FONT><HR>That explains it, he's a SAC pilot. The Strategic Air Command is as dead as Eaker AFB, you still flying B-52's or they move you up on the world yet? <P>You may find this game to your liking because you claim to not play it very often and take it as it is. But for the people who have 140 days or 3360 hours of logged playing time and have countless changes recorded to how they play that game have a right to come to these boards and ask why certain changes were made. I play PVP, there are countless things in my opinion wrong with Vallon Zek. I have brought them up on the Vallon official thread, here in the general thread. Nothing ever gets addressed in PVP. Absor/Abashi have been throwing us a bone for 2 years now every couple months now to stir the proverbial pot so it doesn't boil over. But you seem to come to these boards for one purpose, and its not to start threads on "Why PVP is a side throw in to PVE?" You come into every thread to find something wrong with someone is posting and start a lenghty debate/flame session with everyone you talk with and take the side of sounding intelligent and defensive to avoid baseline flaming that will get you banned. Your interuptions to contructive posts are enough to be a mosquito sucking the "blood" from our disscussions. Go start your own threads with your concerns, and leave the nitpicking of our threads alone so maybe instead of threads getting locked because they turn into flamewars everytime you interrupt, that maybe a blue name will answer our questions and the evloution of the game can flow more freely.<P>SAC officer.....doh</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I haven't posted much on this board because I quit EQ, and I've been doing other things with my life. But I was bored at the moment and just came on here to see what everyone was complaining  about now (these boards are called Whineplay for good reason), and I saw this thread. I started reading it, but when it started turning into a debate between certain posters rather than the original discussion, the turn that many of the threads on this board take, I decided to just skip to the end and post. <P>My opinions on Everquest is it is just a game. I will not judge people who play it for hours on end and tell them what to do with their lives, because that is their business. There is no set meaning of life, and if some people would spend it playing EQ rather than have relationships with others, then that's their choice and I'm not going to put anyone down for it, call it a disease, tell people to "get a life", and so on.  But I would like to politely suggest to everyone who plays EQ, is that you put it in perspective. It's not a life and death situation, and Verant has the right to make their game anyway they want, it is their property. What a lot of people seem to not be able to grasp is that there's thousands of people playing Everquest, and each person has different expectations from the game. There's no way in the world that any game company would be able to make a game to make one thousand people completely happy, much less the whole subscriber base of Everquest. <P>Life isn't perfect, this game isn't perfect. What you can do is politely suggest what changes you want in Everquest, it's Verant's decision on whether to listen or not. Flaming and complaining over and over will accomplish nothing. Unless some of you are doing it just to vent, in that case I'd suggest getting a punching bag and hitting it. It's a healthy way to relieve stress without causing any grief for other people. In the end, Verant doesn't have to listen or do anything you tell them to do. If you're unhappy about certain aspects of the game, you can politely suggest without flaming and insulting Verant and others what you want changed. If that doesn't work, you can just keep whining and complaining and attacking Verant and other players which only ends up causing you and others stress, accept the game as it is and concentrate on the good points, or quit. <P>No game is going to be for everyone, and it's better to find a game you're happy with than trying to waste time trying to get a game company with such a huge subscriber base to mold ths game into what you want. And attacking and insulting people and labelling them VAK only presents an image that you are spoiled children who have to scream loudly to get what you want. I think Verant is doing you a huge favor just by having this game and message board community to begin with. Believe me, if I had to be the target of all the attacks from this playerbase I would of shut them both down a long time ago, I don't think any amount of money is worth this kind of abuse myself. <BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

You were not defending yourself, or being flammed. Instead you instigated all 4 pages of subsequent of flames brought upon yourself. You must like hearing yourself speak, for had you simply not spoke at the beginning of the thread, I wouldn't be arguing with you about 4 pages later.<P>As I said earlier, choose your trolls more wisely old timer.

"it isn't very well thought out if it can stand up to scrutiny" Everything you say is scrutized, therefore your posts must be as illogical as the posts you troll and incite are to be.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Drakezius, I totally agree with you. <P>Don't let players like Bloodsage get to you. Best thing to do is just to ignore them. As annoying as it is for them to come in after your initial post and write their responses on the same thread, it doesn't matter.<P>The best revenge you can have on people like Bloodsage is just to let them continue to believe EQ is worth the amount of time they play on it. While they're playing for 5-10+  hour stretches a day in the land of Norrath the rest of us have already finished playing our more casual games and are out in the real world experiencing things they can't get from EQ. Like perhaps the joys of seeing real mountains, developing RL trade skills that earn us more real money,  or having sex.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Let them play. <BR>Let them believe.<P>I'm not against EQ or anything, it's just I don't believe it's worth the time anymore. Even if my class was balanced and even if I didn't care about leveling or loot. . . .this game is still rather shallow in it's depth of 'entertainment'. <P>Now, a lot of die-hard EQ loyalists still find a lot of enjoyment out of it. Well, good for them. I'm happy for them I guess. If they feel the game is still entertaining for them, then who am I to say anything against that?  If I meet a man in my neighborhood who has fun watching his grass grow, who am I to criticize that? <P>Me, I want to play a game where I can be entertained, whether I play for 10 minutes or I play for 5 hours. A game where the challenges vary enough from one to the other that it keeps me from being bored. I want a game where me and my friends can play together and we can be any 'class' we want. Not a game where one of us  has to make a sacrifice and play a class he doesn't want just because we need that class.<P>EQ is a game that on a scale of 1-10, the gameplay is about a "3" or "4". The thing is this, on a scale of 1-10, the novelty of the persistant on-line massive multiplayer world ranks a high "10". It off sets any of the gameplay flaws so much so that people can't see them or just don't care.<P>EQ's only competitors are Asheron's Call and Ultima Online. That's some weak competition. EQ is king of the hill because of that.<BR>Analogy: It's like a race thru a city. Who are you gonna bet real money on? The guy driving the Camaro(EQ)? The guy on the ten-speed bike(Asheron's Call)? Or the the guy riding the skate board(UO)? Yeah, it's clear who is obviously the one you want to spend money betting on.<P>EQ loyalists will always bring up the fact that EQ is number one. But they believe its because of the game play. *shrug*<P>Now back to that same analogy: What if you now enter new contestants in that race? What if there is now a guy driving a Nissan Skyline and a guy driving a Lamborghini? Is EQ still gonna be the one you put money on?<P>EQ loyalists will say, "yes".<BR>Don't try to change their minds, you can't. They love their game way too much. <P>In closing,  to players like Bloodsage or to players that are EQ loyalists through and through, I applaud you. You have found a way to enjoy something that I personally find mediocre. I don't think there's anything wrong with you guys coming into these kind of threads say "GQLLFM" or whatever. You have the right. It is a public forum. Just so long as you don't mind people like me coming back in and saying our piece of mind too, because we will.<P>To the rest of you who have found EQ's true nature, I hope I see you in some other more entertaining and casual friendly on-line game.<P>-out<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Drak,<P>I don't go into commenting the things that are not about the points of your thread. But I will try to debate with you about your original post. Before I start I want to say that I belive that there are things where only one view on it is ok. For example: I consider water "wet" and not "dry". But most of the times, what *I* think is true might be wrong for others and vice versa. With that in mind I might express options different to yours. As you stated, you can agree on that without taking it personal. So here we go:<P>"1.) Everquest sounds like a fun game, in theory."<P>Last week I was in Sol with 2 "old" friends and met 1 "new" friend. We were fighting Kobolds and had a GREAT time. Not because of exp (although it played a role), not because of loot (although it played a role) but basically because we had fun. We changed our INCOMING messages over and over, we made jokes and so on. For me, it WAS a fun game.<P>I don't know what time you played EverQuest before you came to this thought. I take it you are a very high character. Now can you explain me: did you never had fun with EverQuest? Or did you had fun and now you no longer have? Wouldn't it be more correct to say:<P>"1. Everquest sounds like a fun game, but for me it was only for a certain amount of time. I now came to a moment where I can no longer enjoy it."<P>The difference is huge. If your point 1 is taken as correct, AND you played for a long time, then you played a game that was no fun. That seems odd to me as you seem to be someone who can tell fun from no-fun. <P>I can fully accept that someone loses his interest and enjoyment in a game. But I think it's a big step to claim that EverQuest is only fun in theory. <BR> <BR>"2.) I am a little sad about all the time i spent playing Everquest and not spending time with my family, as I have found that spending time with my family has been exceedingly more interesting and "wierd"."<P>That is a difficult point. It is very personal. If you feel the game you played is "lost" and you should have better spent it with your family, then I can understand that you feel sad. It's the same like building up a car in your backyard and when you are finished, you realize "it's just a car" and that you could have spent the time with someone or something else. No, I don't say "EQ is just a game" because it is more. It's more like building a bottleship is more than "just a hobby" for the one doing it. It's more like "just a hobby" to someone who spent 2 years on painting a picture or writing a book.<P>What makes EQ more than "just a game" is exactly the time you spent. I guess when you play FFIX on your PS2 for 20 hours (just assuming a number here) you don't look back and think "I could have spent the time with my family".<P>I think (and correct me if I'm wrong), you enjoyed the time with EQ more than being with your family. And now, looking back, you feel "guilty" for it in a way. Maybe because someone in your family made fun out of that or others did. They can't see why it was so important to you to play a "game" for so long.<P>When I look at your post, you say "what i have learned from not being able to play Everquest" it tells me that the decision to stop playing for 2 weeks was not entirely up to you. You were "forced" to stop. And being 2 weeks out of it may make you see things differently. Maybe this is the way it is for you now and your enjoyment stops. Or maybe in 2 or 3 weeks you feel the urge to logon again. To meet your friends, to see some places or to just hang around. Everything is possible...<P>"3.) Justification of my time spent playing, is difficult, as i have spent a long time playing Everquest just to get nowhere in game."<P>This point is the one I disagree the most. You DID get somewhere in the game. You met new friends, you accomplished goals you had and I bet you had fun. EverQuest was published as a game. And a game is a tool to get "enjoyment". It's like a book or a movie. You don't know what to expect untill you are at the end. The problem is, a book has a clear end and then you can decide if you liked it or not (or maybe earlier if it's bad). Same goes for a movie. EQ hasn't. It's not the "goal" to reach Level 60. It's not the goal to get item X or to defeat monster Y. It's like playing baseball. You can play it for years and enjoy it. Or you can stop after 5 years and say "I don't like it anymore". But it's not that after 5 years you realize "Oh no, I wasted 5 years". Sure, when you are at the point where baseball doesn't interest you anymore, you think you could have used these 5 years to do something else you like more at that specific moment. That can be football, soccer or playing chess.<P>Don't go there. Don't blame yourself or others for the time you spend. There is nothing to be ashamed of and nothing to be angry about. You bought a game, you enjoyed it and now (for whatever reasons) you no longer like it...<P>"Im sure, from my reading of other posts on this board over the past few weeks, that i am not alone in my dissapointment."<P>No, you're not. There are people stopping to play EverQuest daily. And there are people starting to play daily. At the moment, there are more new ones then leaving ones. This will turn one day. It's the same like there are people stopping to play baseball everyday. But it also hurts to "end" something you enjoyed. So you seek "excuses" for yourself to justify your "end". Not because of others. They have no right to comment your stop. But for your own mind. It's easier to say "I stop EQ because they made it unenjoyable" than to say "I stop EQ because I no longer like it". It's only human. The girlfriend who left you (not you personal, just an explanation) was "weird" anyway or even "most possible cheated on me" than to realize it just ended.<P>"What is odd, is that i cant really finger out any particular reason for the sour-taste i experiance in my mouth when i even think about spending hours a night again on Everquest."<P>You don't have to. That is the great thing. If you don't want to play, you don't have to. No, that's not great for me because of less lag. Personally, I don't care. Not because I don't care about you as a person, but we never met in game. I don't lose a friend and I don't lose an enemy. I just see someone with new goals for himself, and that is his personal opinion and way.<P>In one of your posts you said "give us solid reasoning and substansiated facts about how you do not believe my points are valid."<P>I tried to do that. With one exception. I think your points ARE valid. But they are only valid for yourself (and for the ones agreeing on you or sharing these thoughts). But they are not valid to me. That doesn't make them wrong in total, but *I*, at the moment, enjoy EverQuest. I have fun playing it. Yes, I'm not 50 yet and maybe, in 1 year or so (I'm 40 now after 16 months of playing) I share your points. Or maybe in 2 weeks already.<P>I'm not really sure what the intent of your post was. Was it to hear that you are right? Well, you are never wrong in finding YOUR point of view. If you whole heartly belive that sliced bread is the best thing on earth, then do so. And if someone says "you're wrong" then he's wrong. It's YOUR opinion and therefore valid per se.<P>Or did you want someone to convince you that you are wrong? That is not possible either. As again, it is YOUR opinion. And just because my opinion differs, doesn't make mine righter or yours wronger.<P>Or was it to argue and debate it in a open way? Then I may have helped and showed you my opinon. I'm more than happy to discuss but I don't expect you to change yours and hope you don't expect me to change mine.<P>Whatever your decision will be, I hope you enjoy it. Be that stopping EQ totally, cutting back on it or go full steam again.<P>*bows*<P>Ellegon<BR>Halfling Druid<BR>Xegony<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Cerberus4:<P>You most certainly did state that you were back using a different handle, and that you were making it a point to follow me around to try to have the moderator take action, because you didn't like something I said to you before.  Seems like the definition of "vendetta" to me.<P>And why the cowardly name change?  If you're so upset about something that happened before, why don't you identify yourself, rather than sulk around under a new name making vague references to the past?<P>Fopoode:<P>If you would read the two statements you quote more closely, you'd note that one (mine) is discussing behaviors, while the other is attempting to address the subconscious motivation for behavior.  That is why the person doing the latter had better be a psychology professional for it to be valid.<P>It is one thing to say, "You seem awfully zealous in your arguments, and often preclude any debate by preemptively stating that anyone with a differing opinion is a troll," than it is to say, "Your arguing reveals a deep mental instability, manifested in your projection of your own insecurities upon others."<P>See the difference, now?  The first is characterization of observable behavior, the second is speculation as to motivation and mental health.  Quite obvious, if you read closely.<P>Straithlin:<P>When will you get a clue?  Your constant whining, in spite of both explanation and clear evidence, defies reason.  Discussing the behavior is not attacking the person.  Debating the ideas is not attacking the person.  Get over it.  I get the hint you're exceptionally sensitive, and think the boards should be a love-in where no one actually discusses anything, but rather simply posts their ideas for Verant to read.  That's not the way they're run, nor why they were set up.<P>If you can't take it, then cease putting your ideas here, and simply e-mail them to Verant.  That way no one will make you unhappy.<P>Or, better, yet, start paying attention to what is and is not allowed, and notice the patterns.  Without the filter of your prejudices against me and VI.  You'll notice that the model I've shown you more than once explains things nicely.  Quit whining that you think the rules ought to be different, and start following them.<P>If you would read more closely, and without your prejudices blinding you, you'd also know that I simply chose to take issue with Drakezius' insulting and immature characterization of all disagreement as propaganda by VAKs and trolls.  That is not a personal attack.  Yet his response to me was.  Hmmm, coupled with his original insult, I think it's rather clear who derailed the thread, if it was ever meant to be a discussion at all.  How can there be a discussion, if you state right up front that anyone who disagrees is a VAK?  You'll even notice--there's that reading closely thing again--that his later attempts to redefine the statement all carry the same meaning: "feel free to disagree, but if I don't like your opinion, you're a VAK."  That's not discussion.  It's insulting, regardless what one's opinion is.  It's also childish and illogical, and ample proof why he's known as "the male Dazzler."<P>Just a thought.<P>Nobody:<P>You should actually read a thread before making generalizations about its participants.<P>Where do you get the idea I spend much time playing EQ, or that I have no life outside of it?  Simply because that's a convenient way for you to dismiss what I say without addressing the substance?<P>Comment when you've got a clue.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Drazekius,<P>If EQ is anything other than fun for you, it's pretty stupid to keep hanging around.  Blaming VI for your lack of fun is nonsensical, as is blaming them for your allegedly wasted time.<P>Your ability to have fun, as well as your ability--or not--to prioritize your life, are firmly in your own control.  If you aren't having fun, or if your RL suffers due to the time spent in EQ, it is your fault.  No one else's.<P>Nor do ridiculously fantastical analogies help your case; they prove nothing other than your desperation and inability to control your feelings.  <P>If you don't like it, leave.  It's easy.  There is no "investment" you are abandoning, because you own nothing except the memories.  If they are happy ones, you've gained a treasure.  If they are unhappy, one wonders why you've done that to yourself.  And self-inflicted they are, because, contrary to certain widely-held beliefs, you have all the power in the VI-consumer relationship: you can leave at any time, and take your money with you.  Without consequence.<P>If you want a game specifically tailored to give you infinite enjoyment for an indefinite time, then write it yourself.  That's the only way to make it happen.  Whining that Verant hasn't met your individual expectations, and is the root of your admitted inability to prioritize your life, is silly.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;If you would read the two statements you quote more closely, you'd note that one (mine) is discussing behaviors, while the other is attempting to address the subconscious motivation for behavior. That is why the person doing the latter had better be a psychology professional for it to be valid.<P>But when the opinon on motivation is based entirely on their observation of your character, is there really a difference? You want to play the technicality game (which is a poor way to conduct any argument), can we not say your characterization of behaviour is no less arbitrary than their opinions on your motivation and mental health? Why yes we could. Given both are derived from the very same thing, I'd say that's more than fair. <P>(here's an un-related to this point but thoroughly amusing quote)<BR>&gt;Perhaps if some of you rabid Verant-bashers would take personal responsibility for your feelings and your conduct<P>By the same broad generalisation and mis-interpretation you used on the original posters VAK comment, I too, will make a broad generalisation on this statement by assuming it must be about me since I am not agreeing with you. But how could it possibly be about me? I'm no Verant-basher in that I don't go out of my way to tell them they suck. Nor do I disagree with Verant just because they're Verant. If you do not see the problem with your logic (and mine in this example) then there is nothing more I can do as I would have more luck with a rock.<P>&gt;See the difference, now? The first is characterization of observable behavior, the second is speculation as to motivation and mental health. Quite obvious, if you read closely.<P>Ah. I love it when would-be message board debaters who are down on their luck choose to win many "perceived", yet minor, victories in an effort to break attention away from the main argument(s) in which they have no foothold. Not even a good one at that. Considering the opinions on your "motivation and mental health" mostly came from direct characterizations of your behaviour (that is to say, your un-necessary posts about people's presentation of ideas), I'd say this qualfies for: Pot. BloodSage. Black.<P>&gt;Discussing the behavior is not attacking the person. Debating the ideas is not attacking the person. Get over it. I get the hint <P>Here's one point where we agree.<P>&gt;you're exceptionally sensitive, and think the boards should be a love-in where no one actually discusses anything, but rather simply posts their ideas for Verant to read. That's not the way they're run, nor why they were set up.<P>I doubt the intention was as a "proving ground" of sorts for someone with a large vocabulary. You might believe you are all in the right here and I can see how you could come to that conclusion, as delusional as it is. But your assesment of the original VAK comment (when you read your counter-arguments are the root of your entire moral defense) is going out on a limb to say the least. I won't be so foolish as you as to abstain any responsiblity in taking this thread off topic, but throughout the course of this thread I find it increasingly hard to believe you're any better than these "trolls" you appear to enjoy bashing and talking down on.<P>"If you can't take it, then cease putting your ideas here, and simply e-mail them to Verant. That way no one will make you unhappy."<P>I further doubt their intention was to give someone, such as yourself, a place to feel like a "big man". If it hasn't been clear through the 5-6 posts I've made which you never responded to  my beef with you is direct attacks on the way people present their ideas and their use to somehow retroactively nullify any point they were trying to make. You do this all the time. People who win arguments based on the complexity of the English language in reality win nothing at all.<P>&gt;Or, better, yet, start paying attention to what is and is not allowed, and notice the patterns. Without the filter of your prejudices against me and VI. <P>The interpretation that anyone who disagrees with you is automatically a Verant basher is in the same with your interpretation that anybody who disagrees with Drak is automatically a VAK. In other words, it's weak. That you based an argument this far while avoiding the main points in contention allows me to complete my classification of your posting persona. Allow me:<P>- You are the type, who, when a point is lost will choose to ignore it and instad, pick out some meaningless side-point, irrelevant to the real discussion and win a "victory" based entirely on the fact that the side-point can be subjective and interpreted in a way obviously not intended by the poster. But given the nature of the English language, you can get away with it.<P>- You are the type of poster, who for whatever reasons, feels the need to make your command of the English language known to all and ridicule those who do not or can not meet your ridiculous expectations. Just because this is a message board and that inherently means discussion on topics, it does not mean people should have to put up with your incessant nit picking.<P>- You can not, will not and must not under any circumstances admit that you could in fact, be wrong. It goes against everything you stand for, which is, more or less, a bunch of superficial rhetoric.<P>&gt;If you would read more closely, and without your prejudices blinding you, you'd also know that I simply chose to take issue with Drakezius' insulting and immature characterization of all disagreement as propaganda by VAKs and trolls. <P>A perfect example of the mis-interpretations I have been talking about. Where did he clearly state that all who disagree are automatically VAKs? Are you saying it was implied in his statement? By definition, a VAK is I suppose a "Verant Ass Kisser". How else is he to classify the person(s) who would come to a thread simply to defend VI just for the sake of doing it, as opposed to those who would come to the thread and disagree respectfully? If you thought he included you in that statement before you made the thread fully aware of that, perhaps the shoe fits? If you feel it does, which you obviously did, then what are you getting offended about?<P>How about if he said: May all those who would come here to disagree just for the sake of defending Verant, do so.<P>He would essentially be saying the same thing, no?<P>You can go on to argue how the term VAK is thrown around and somewhere in Afghanistan some little boy thinks a VAK is anybody who has a beef with Verant, justified or not. You can not assume everybody has been exposed to this type of mis-use and if you made that assumption the blame is yours and yours alone.<P>&gt;That is not a personal attack. Yet his response to me was. Hmmm, coupled with his original insult, I think it's rather clear who derailed the thread, if it was ever meant to be a discussion at all.<P>How can you not aknowledge even a portion of responsibility? Is your world black and white? A world of extremes? I would like to visit this world you live in. Where can I get tickets?<P>&gt;How can there be a discussion, if you state right up front that anyone who disagrees is a VAK?<P>You seem to be using this as your only real point. Fair enough, but if only it were true you'd be on to something. He specifically said VAKs, not "all who may disagree with me". I don't know what defintion you go by but those are entirely different things unless you've been affected by the very same stereotypers you claim to hate. If you'll notice in this thread a couple people posted differing opinions than Drak and he did not go off calling them VAKs. He tried really hard to convince them otherwise, though  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">. The only person he's been arguing with is you.<P>That's sort of a constant in the threads you post in, isn't it?<P>If you get off on arguing and looking down on people, hey more power to you. But people won't always stand idly by and take it up the ass.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>precision,<P>Nice try, but most of that is mere fluff.  I'll spare you the critique of your grammar: it was a good effort, flawed though it is.<P>First, as to the difference between characterizing behavior and assessing motivation: there is a clear difference, which you seem not to grasp.  The first is a point for debate, while the second merely attempts to stifle debate by categorically rejecting ideas based upon their source rather than their merit.  As I said, quite a difference.  Had you any training in debate or logic, you'd know that.<P>Second, your attempts to divine my motivations are pointless as well as rather far out in left field.  Even granting each of your points, for the sake of argument, what does it matter?  Is someone who tells you it's raining somehow less correct because he does it simply to watch you juggle your umbrella with your briefcase?  No.  Therefore attempts to psychoanalyze others to determine their motivation--even if possible--serve no purpose in an argument, whereas debating and discussing the actual conduct of that argument can bear fruit through eventual mutual agreement on how to proceed.<P>Third, do you have a clue what constitutes a personal attack, and what does not?  My first post, by definition, is not a personal attack: it specifically quotes, addresses, and finds wanting, the post, rather than the poster.  Yet the response is, indeed, personal, in that it is simply a string of name calling.<P>Fourth, I do not admit I am wrong because no one has bothered to address anything other than my perceived motivation.  As you do.  I do, specifically, open the possibility that I could be wrong on individual points--but you'd have had to read the thread to find that.  Try harder.<P>Finally, why do you assume that, simply because my thoughts are well organized and I use a college-level vocabulary that I'm being condescending?  Perhaps you simply need to take things at face value, rather than assigning motivation.  Motivation, as I've stated, is irrelevant--yet you and many others seem to focus nearly exclusively upon it.  Your only forays into discussing the ideas are to dismiss other opinions due to--you guessed it--your assessment of the motivation behind their expression.  It was not unreasonable to take Drakezius' last line the way I did; his later alleged explications provide even more proof I was right, and he specifically stated it _was_ aimed as an insult to me.  His very reaction to my calling him out on the point proves what I was saying: he didn't explain what he really meant, he launched into a personal attack.  I'm not going to use more, smaller, words, just so certain people don't feel bad about themselves.<P>In conclusion, you've made a nifty attempt to mimic my style, but you lack a certain flair, and your construction needs work.  Keep trying.  And read up on logic and debate: those skills will serve you better than obtuse sentence construction.  Learn the differences between discussing ideas and behaviors--both observable phenomena--and assigning motivation for the sole purpose of dismissing the person rather than the idea.  Then come back when you've got something to say.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

To me, it seems he was just venting and maybe looking for some consolation.<P>Bloodsage was right that anyone who tends to defend Verant is labelled a VAK. Verant has made mistakes, but so have I, and every person and company out there. People just need to realise that Verant is not out to get them or ruin their gaming experience.<P>People just need to back off and stop attacking each other.

No. Therefore attempts to psychoanalyze others to determine their motivation--even if possible--serve no purpose in an argument, whereas debating and discussing the actual conduct of that argument can bear fruit through eventual mutual agreement on how to proceed.<P>Neither does attacking one's presentation. I hear the pot calling again. What you keep ignoring is that your posts are filled with statements like <P>&gt;Nice try, but most of that is mere fluff. I'll spare you the critique of your grammar: it was a good effort, flawed though it is.<P>&gt;Had you any training in debate or logic, you'd know that.<P>that achieve what? You are correct that there is a technical difference between arguing over presentation and behaviour (when it has absolutely nothing to do with the current topic) and juding intent. I've pointed out already, they are derived from the same source and achieve the same end. Your bounds are fuzzy and you are again arguing on a technicality, like you always do.<P>&gt;Third, do you have a clue what constitutes a personal attack, and what does not? My first post, by definition, is not a personal attack: it specifically quotes, addresses, and finds wanting, the post, rather than the poster. Yet the response is, indeed, personal, in that it is simply a string of name calling.<P>And you bring this up, why? I'm not calling for you to be banned. I'm not claming you're breaking any rules. Just for the sake of spouting off some irrelevant garbage that has no bearing on this discussion?<P>Let me spell it out in plain English:<P>Your nit-picking, arrogance and general attitude stink.<P>Is this not clear? Or was the above quote just another run-off tangent of yours?<P>&gt;Fourth, I do not admit I am wrong because no one has bothered to address anything other than my perceived motivation. As you do. I do, <P>Yes the entire post was about my perceived motivation of you. *rolls eyes*. Is there a reason you keep going back to this point? Perhaps its because its the only point you make that is actually sound?<P>&gt;specifically, open the possibility that I could be wrong on individual points--but you'd have had to read the thread to find that. Try harder.<P>I'm looking at the second post. I see a bad interpretation and a snide comment (GQLLFM).<P>&gt;Finally, why do you assume that, simply because my thoughts are well organized and I use a college-level vocabulary that I'm being condescending? Perhaps you simply need to take <P>Because you frequently use it in a condescending way? How you could be so naive to your own posts is amazing. But you are no doubt aware of what you do and just enjoy being that way.<P>&gt;things at face value, rather than assigning motivation. Motivation, as I've stated, is irrelevant--yet you and many others seem to focus nearly exclusively upon it. Your only forays into <P>I've been clinging onto the motivation issue because that's been your way of invalidating everyone's points. If you think my post centered all its arguments around the fact that I think you're a self-centered waste of board space, then you obviously skipped large portions of the post.<P>&gt;discussing the ideas are to dismiss other opinions due to--you guessed it--your assessment of the motivation behind their expression. It was <P>Funny, that was the exact contention I've been making of you all along? Fun game this is, isn't it? I've provided specific situations where I've made my point. All you've done here is throw it back at me, avoiding any real rebuttal. Thanks for coming out, though.<P>&gt;not unreasonable to take Drakezius' last line the way I did; his later alleged explications provide even more proof I was right, and he specifically stated it _was_ aimed as an insult to me. His very reaction to my calling him out on <P>Because he perceives you as a VAK and you made a self-aknowledge saying as much, maybe?<P>You again miss the point I was making, but again that's not surprising. You're very good at missing the point.<P>You contend he was specifically trying to tell everyone who did not agree with him to go away. By providing a specific example (you) you prove nothing.<P>&gt;the point proves what I was saying: he didn't <P>Uh, no it doesn't, heh.<P>&gt;explain what he really meant, he launched into a personal attack. I'm not going to use more, smaller, words, just so certain people don't feel bad about themselves.<P>No, but you're specifically using it as leverage in arguments, which is beyond lame.<P>&gt;In conclusion, you've made a nifty attempt to mimic my style, but you lack a certain flair, and <P>Lol don't flatter yourself, but at least I know I have the self-centered part right.<P>&gt;your construction needs work. Keep trying. And read up on logic and debate: those skills will serve you better than obtuse sentence construction. Learn the differences between discussing ideas and behaviors--both observable phenomena--and assigning motivation for the sole purpose of dismissing the person rather than the idea. Then come back when you've got something to say.<P>More petty ridicule on presentation and for what? You keep proving my point. It's demeaning and using it (as you put it and I quote) "to stifle debate by categorically rejecting ideas based upon their source rather than their merit. "<P>Once again (say it with me):<P>Kettle. BloodSage.
