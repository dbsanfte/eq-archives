</FONT><HR>As you requested, concise and to the point (unlike my posts on the wizard talk thread  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> ). I'll say the problem, then follow with the way I suggest you solve it (Solution), and the way you MUST NOT solve it (How to Make Matters Worse)<P>1) Fix Rain and Column AE spells. On PvP-Teams, they hit group-mates who are on a different team than your own. My understanding is on PvE, they hit everyone. Personal Based AE spells do not hit group-mates of different teams.<P>Solution 1- Change it so AE's do not hit group-mates. Easiest for you.<P>Solution 2- The better solution. Have an option in the options menu on whether or not AE's should hit those of opposite race. This would allow raids etc to use AE's (theres been a few times where Ive killed a friend along with the thousands of goblins).<P>Solution 3- Do not have AE's hit group-mates and guild-mates.<P>How to Make Matters Worse 1- Make PB AE's hit group-mates of opposite race.<P>How to Make Matters Worse 2- Do nothing.<P>2) Faction- On PvP-Teams, you lose faction after killing someone. However, in many cases, this leads to much problems. I for example, do not kill humans when I can. However, certain guilds (PK Guilds) kos me, leaving me with no choice but to fight or flee. They may also attack my friends, leaving me in the position to help them kill an evil human or turn a blind eye. Because these humans are "evil" I kill them. However, I receive terrible faction with humans, which forces me to do numerous quests to up faction. Ive handed in thousands of left goblin ears in HK, gone back and forth from South to North Qeynos handing in arrow chests. After hours, I can buy from humans again. Only to meet a Combine Ressurection member (Human PK guild) and immediatly kill him. There are a few solutions to this:<P>Solution 1- Decrease the amount of faction lost when killing a PC. The faction hits are terrible, and after killing 5, I /con threateningly in human lands, even though I worship Quellious and am a high elf with 85 CHA.<P>Solution 2- Rallos Zek type faction.<P>Solution 3- No lost faction in duels. When I duel with a friend we never fight to the death. The first to hit one bubble of life or lower loses. This way may not solve the slaying evil human problem, but would help in some cases.<P>Solution 4- Base faction hits on the individuals faction with your own race. For example, if the human individual is kos in elf land, dont give faction hits if an elf kills him.<P>3) Immortal Healing- This is a real pain, when your killing someone and a cleric friend of theirs who's 20 levels above you comes and complete heals him when he's just about to die.<P>Solution 1- When the PC is targeted and auto-attack is on, no heals may come from one 8 (or 4) levels above the person who is auto-attacking.<P>How to Make Matters Worse- No one 8 (or 4) levels or above or below can heal the person.<P><BR>That wasnt exactly as concise as I wished it to be, but it will have to do. Thanks for lending an ear.<P>Evantine Essidel<BR>High Elf Wizard of the Tranquil<BR>30th Season<BR>Vallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi,<P>I have been playing on Rallos Zek for a year and half now. At first when I started on that server I did not realize what PvP was since EQ was my first MMORPG.<P>So here is the problems / possible fixes<P>1. ITEM GANKING. Many guilds and players live solely on items ganking. Here is what happens: some players gather in the guilds like Darkenbane on Rallos, and most they do is travel in groups and gank items from single players / players low on health from the PvE fights. Portal camping (wizzy and druid) is a common and most often excercised form of exploiting, there the people often find themselves porting in and dying within the first 4-5 seconds from the group of 3-4 wizards and an enchanter (check www.darkenbane.com where 80% of murdered character screenshots were made within direct sight of druid or wiz portals).  What happens with all the loot they receive? That's how most of Rallos E-Bay auctions are fed. Then on the money made, they purchase a level 54-55 necro or wizard account, and do the same on higher level (why bother leveling!?)... <P>Fix: /coinloot on  FLAG, PLEASE IMPLEMENT !!!!<BR>  Why Rallos never been given a choice of changing to coin loot server or to blue server? Are we not really  important customers?<P>2. MOVELOG. Many people started on Rallos and PvP by mistake. Please give them the opportunity to move away from insanity of PvP if you do not want to change to coinloot flag.  I brought my wizard to a high level, have manastone, old guise of deceiver, and other stuff that is hard to get, do you think I am inclined to start a new character on another server and do everything over again?  It's not too hard to do, please do what customers have been asking for so long... We are respecting you by paying our fees every month, show us some of your respect, and let us chose.  It's ridiculous to lose an item that was quested/camped for a few days in a matter of 7-10 seconds.<P>Fix: Create /movelog to some blue server and maybe some Coinloot only server. Next time you visit Rallos, the server will be emptier for 50%.<P>3. TWINKING.  Ever seen a level 13 wearing diamond rings, JBoots, SMR, MR rings, all together worth of equipment for a level 45 character?  I've seen that a lot.<P>Fix:  Start ITEM MINIMUM LEVEL so that a low level character COULD NOT EVEN POSESS a Shiny Metallic Robe. This will take care of mules and uber-twinks. In my opinion Jboots should not be allowed worn before level 25 since NO GROUP below 25 can kill AC even in S Ro.<P>4. PvP of pre 51 and post 51.  There should be a NO-CROSS border between PvP right at 51. Meaning 50 can not attack 51 and vice versa.  Post 50 spells are VERY POWERFUL, FAST CASTING, and a wizard at 50 and 4 bubbles has NO CHANCE to win a duel from 51 wizard.<BR>Example:<P>level 49: Rend. cast 6.3! damage 774, mana 280<BR>Level 51: Draught of fire: cast 3 !!damage 643, mana 215.<P>Now let's compare: for 1 rend casted by 50, level 51 casts twice, and pretty much any caster is dead from 2 643x.66 spells, or needed another low level spell to kill caster.  This is no good.  I saw level 49 casters kill level 45 casters in one shot of Ice Comet.  Just like that, from full health to instadeath. One cast. We need a border at 51.<P>Thanks,<BR>Belia Deathbind</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I only see PvP valuable for Role Playing purposes.<BR>-Create a new server Role Playing only (full PvP) with no carry overs and twinks. No need to impose those changes to unwilling players.<BR>-Establish again Faction hits for attacker.<BR>-Cancel instant respawn on any death (will make anyone double think about attacking anything / Player or MOB). To still have the game playable create a raise dead/summon corpse option by NPC Clerics for a certain amount of Plats. This to make a purge of all players who are only here to PK with no other RPG motive. I can understand/appreciate a Troll Shammie beating up an Elf Paladin (or vice versa) but i would like to have a REAL risk involved for the one who initiates that fight (Doh i died - Re Doh i cant play this character for a certain time - Bye bye "Quake type" players). Dont misunderstand me Quake can be fun but no Role Playing in there.<BR>-Respawn could be moved to a certain time frame with the possible Loss of some/all carried items if exceeding usual Corpse retrieval window<BR>-I have seen a suggestion to Lower Guard and other NPCs levels, why not, it would be fun to see more Town raids (hey its a dangerous world after all)<BR>A lot of other ideas can pop up but i think that this MAJOR change (no automatic respawn) would bring more to the flavor of the game (death and its consequences would just be more RPG like) and hopefully promote Role Playing.<BR>Some might say it would make the game too hard, i am not so sure (as an example i raised an Iksar SK on Rallos Zek to the 5th lvl only dying once - and because i felt overconfident on smaller MOBs). But i am sure it would promote grouping and/or smart playing and make the game less of an on line chat room. Sure less likely to see groups with a Paladin and a Necromancer or a Dark Elf and a halfling, or if we did hopefully it would be with very good role playing reasons.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here is a list of items that I feel should be addressed(this is from information on TZ so i cant speak for RZ).<P>1. The lvl range is insane. Does a lvl 1 have a chance against a lvl 8? PLEASE drop the attack range from 8 levels to 4.<P>2. Create a Good VS Evil server and use the POD to set a neutral tag that allows a person to attack anyone within the lvl range, if someone starts to X-team heal then a guide can come along and turn the healers tag to neutral.<P>3. I like the idea of only taking faction hits if you attack, nothing is worse then killing someone who is attacking you only to find out that your faction is now horrible.<P>4. PLEASE remove the faction hits from arena deaths and duels! I cant duel my human friends for fear of a faction hit.<P>5. Hybrid spells in PVP are horrible, look at a rangers first DD spell. 15 dmg for 15 manna and that is against an NPC. I say let hybrid spells hit for FULL force in PVP and let our DOTs do max dmg against any type of target, even if they are running around (more of an upgrade to Hybrids then to general PVP)<P>6. Guards are way to powerful and has made city raids impossible. Change the guards to lvl 10 but hit, and have the HPs of a lvl 20 mob. That would keep people from farming them for exp and let higher lvl people raid a city and take over(this idea has been said before but it is such a good idea I could not resist putting it in my list)<P>- A ranger from Tallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>/agree Dr_Fate<BR>If my understanding of VZ is correct, It has evolved more twards the 4 team server whereas TZ has evolved more twards the LvD(light vs dark) server.  If this is true, I would recommend that VZ be hardcoded for 4 team and TZ hardcoded for LvD and open the /movelog to see how things fall.  Personally, I think this will bring about a huge influx of players from VZ to TZ.  Because as EQ was not designed for PVP and the difficulties of high level PVP(tank resists etc) and PVE(100k+ hp mobs) is concerned, People would prefer not closing off certin parts of the game to themselves just because of a few people who prefer to follow a certin concept.  We've all seen the results of the /movelog between TZ and VZ when item loot was removed from TZ.  This should tell you that most of the people still want to be able to play the game and the truth is PVP will always take a backseat when you are talking about a catastrophic change which involves the fundimental playability of the game.  what it comes down to is that EQ was is and never will be designed for PVP so if you want to continue neglecting the concequences to the PVP servers when the nerf bat is whipped out, then you will agree that EQ is a PVE game first and PVP is just something that will never take top priority in overall Verant decision making process as to what conform to the "Vision".  This is so because the "Vision" never was intended for PVP, just PVE</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>GvE might be a little harder to implement than a teams server, since there's more to consider in classifying someone as "evil" than just one variable. (EG race)<P>I think at the start of the game (or when the /movelog happens) you should have to choose whether you are evil or not depending on race, class, and religion variables.<P>IE Anyone following Innoruuk is evil, but an agnostic DE has a choice whether to forsake their upbringing and join the Good side. (they are "The Spurned" after all) <P>I think that a server based along those lines would be very attractive to a lot of the players currently on the teams servers.<P>BTW My main characters name is Fassanas, 41st level cleric, and I didn't join TZ because I wanted to kill people. I joined because I thought it blatantly ridiculous that a DE Necromancer following Innoruuk grouping with a Paladin following Erollisi was a common sight.<P>PS: My amazing PKing skills and the inherent PK bonuses of my class have allowed me to get about 5 kills in 41 levels.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Newander1 obviously dislikes me in game, otherwise he must take offense to someone who disagrees with what he thinks is right on a message board. Either way, insulting someone in a serious discussion thread is not the way to handle things.<BR>_____________________<P>Regarding Hardcoding of the teams.<P>I don't think most people who advocate hard coding the teams have actually thought about the reprocussions of doing so. It might make things interesting for a few weeks, but eventually it'll ruin the server. Contrary to what some people may think, PvE is a huge part of Tallon and Vallon Zek.<P>On Tallon, the balance of power where lights and darks are concerned is still in favor of the darks, simple because they're far more organized, even though they're grossly outnumbered. If the teams were to be hard coded, the balance of power would be destroyed.<P>Forcing 3000 people to play different than they have been for over a year is wrong, in my oppinion. See my solution below, I believe it would work out best for both sides.<P>The lights took down VS yesterday, they used 3 teams to do that. Would they be happy if they were forced to do so with only one team? Would they have even accomplished it? I believe some people are beginning to see the reprocussions for a hard coded server, yet the few who speak out for this change are unfortunately louder than those who oppose the idea.<P>I still think a Guild War server would be the best solution. Don't say that I advocate that just because I'm in the most powerful guild on the server, it's entirely possible for a guild of equal power to form level and number wise to combat PDM. This would allow for people who have built friendships across different 'teams' to choose their allies, and their enemies. The word 'Teams' would refer to each individual guild. Each guild would be a Team, possibly consisting of 4 races without the burdens of good vs evil. People would finally be able to do the big things EQ was meant for in addition to warring with opposing guilds. I cannot think of a better solution.<P>Rekash<BR>Circle Noir<BR>Pandemonium</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Too many people joined this server as to have a race war, certain players have grown tired of pvp, so they turn to pve."<P>I don't think too many people joined the server to have a racewar, seeing as how 70% of the server crossteams with the other races.<P>PDM is the most active PvP guild on the server, that cannot be disputed, we are also the most active PvE guild on the server, that cannot be disputed either. Don't make assumptions, we pvp with 20+ people almost daily, we take the fight to karnors or wherever the lights are, while the darks sit in sebilis 24/7. Therefore, I'd have to disagree with your statement.<P>Creating a guildwar server would instigate more pvp as well as pve. People keep saying that PDM wantsa guild war server because it would give them an advantage, but we wouldn't have any more of an advantage than we already have by our numbers, cooperation and levels. In fact, I believe it would be to the benefit of the guilds outside of PDM. What would happen if Blood Tribe, Pahojen Kilta and Alliance of the Light got together and formed a team, whereas the darks in the combined guilds could hit the darks in PDM. A guildwar server would hamper PDM, but I still believe it would be the best for the server as a whole.<P>Selphie<BR>Circle Noir<BR>Pandemonium</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As a player on Tallon Zek (PvP Teams), for over a year now, I quickly realized that this sever is not 'Teams'. It is dark vs. light and has been that way since the first x-teaming light guild was formed.  The issue of out of range and invulnerable healers/buffers has been a problem for that long.  That is because EQ was not written for PvP from the beginning.  <P>Problem 1.  Out of range healers, while not a true exploit does create an unfair advantage.  The solution to this is to set a level limit on healing and buffing equal to the pvp limits.  while the possiblitly of an oor healer/buffer is possible, it would not pose an advantage that is so great as to  make it unfair.  A lvl 20 cleric buffing and healing a lvl 12 warrior engaged with lvl 12 opponents is not the same as a lvl50 cleric healing/buffing  the same warrior fighitng lvl 15 opponents.<P>Problem 2.  The invulnerable healer/buffer, in my opinion, is an exploit.  This gives an unfair advantage that cannot be overcome.  I witnessed this in East Commons on February 21st, 2001.  Gylen, human monk, lvl55+ was soloing up to 12 lvl50+ Dark Elves.  Gylen had a lvl60 DE Cleric named Selphie buffing and healing him during the entire fight.  This would be like having the benefits of Harmshield forever but still able to heal/buff your group.  Imagine doing that on a plane raid.  That is what Gylen was doing taking on 12 50+ characters at once.  <P>The solution, as I see it, is to make the 'Team PvP' servers true team servers.  Eliminate the ability for other teams to heal, buff, teleport or ressurect other teams.  This would have a very large impact on all the guilds, both positive and negative.<P>This would also pose a problem that is as of now only seen by the Dark Team. Not all skills are shared by all teams.  Darks do not have druids and rangers, thus cannot track, nice skill to have for pvp.  The elves do not have necros, shamans or shadow knights, thus cannot summon corpse, but with their x-teaming history they have not realy been with out this skill.<P>I like the idea of making the sever two teams, Darks and Shorts against Elves and Humans. Make it so that teams cannot heal, buff, ressurect or teleport as above.  Then both teams would have all skills.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Itzeana...<P>What are you asking? What is a 3 team X-teamer?<P>If you mean the current way of life on TZ. <P>Your character can either play light vs dark or humans vs all the other teams. Its up to you. You'll be welcome to do either by anyone on this board.<P>If you mean where will you go if a light vs dark server opens and you movelog to it, I personally think that anyone from Paineel is on the dark team. (Hence why your SK has a red, dark, ominous cavern background when you select her).<P>Somepeople might like light vs darks with human/erud SK's staying light, but IMHO this is kind of wrong. Oh well.<P><BR>If a hardcoded 4 team server goes in, you will be on the human team.<P>Why is this so hard to understand?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Repost from an external forum:<P>I'm trying to beat the dead horse again. But Absor throwing another bone to the PVP community to get our hopes up, got me thinking on the issue. In reality I don't expect any changes, but who knows. There are a couple of conditions like new games (Shadowbane and DAoC), and blue servers getting more crowded every day that can motivate Verant to take some action on PVP gameplay issues.<P><BR>In my opinion class balance is not the main issue in RZ. Everquest is not a one on one game, it is a grouping game. Verant will always balance PVE first, and PvP will be balance only to address exploits and things of that nature. <BR>For example a monk can claim that he is un-effective in PVP. But, What about a Druid + Monk combo? That combo can be very lethal. It is quit obvious that the solo classes (ie. necro, druid, shaman) are more effective in PVP. Those classes have the tools to kill an experiece-give-mob solo due to the wide range of tools at their dispossal. Nerfing PVE capabilities on a class is not the answer.<P>In my opinion the are two fundamental problems with RZ PVP.<BR>1. Penalty <BR>Basically, the penalty is based on if you are bagged or running on no-drop equipment. Those that have access to no-drop equipment have a huge advantage over those who can't camp those equipment (due to time limitations) or those classes that don't have a good selection of no-drop equipment. That's a big failure, the penalty should be universal. Equality is key. Also, in most cases is not possible to gain retribution. A penalty must be suffered at all times, even if your are naked.<P>2. Reward<BR>Same as above. Is your target bagged or in no-drop?<BR>Also if you get an uber or good item in PVP, you ganked it. No way a player would risk hours of camping on a few minutes or even seconds. I may be wrong but I think this applies to 99% of the population, there may be 1% truly hardcore. I'm not against of ganking or surprise attacks, however we all know that the odds are stacked heavily on the attacker. I don't think getting a big reward for it is right.<P>How do we fix this?<BR>1. Penalty<BR>Experience loss + Res. Debuff Effects<P>I think experience loss makes an excellent Universal Penalty. I would suggest a ratio of 1/5 of a yellow bub at any level. I'm lvl 48, not sure how would this affect the 50+ game. But this figure is not an absolute value and can be improved upon. Pre-Kunark getting experience at 35+ level was a real pain, due to overcrowding and small amount of high level zones. But now, there is a lot of options to gain experience at any level. I was against experience loss on PvP pre-Kunark. Also, this allows the community to somewhat police themselves.<P>To declare a victor and eliminate any kind of bind-rushing, there should be a strong Res. type debuff upon PVP death (30 minutes or more). Also, if you get killed during this period you would not lose experience, to prenvent bind point camping, deleveling or corpse camping. The debuff should eliminate the ability of a player to operate on PvP or PVE.<P>2. Rewards<BR>When you go and kill the a named NPC, do you always get the reward you were looking for? No.<BR>Basically I think the best way to handle the rewards is through a Random based system. Like those on the NPCs.<BR>Example:<BR>If I kill a player that is lower level than me. I get a 5% percentage probability of gaining an item from what he had equiped prior to dying (no held items). On the other hand if I kill a player higher level than me, then the probability should be higher (10%). There is a chances that nothing may drop, and a higher chance of an inventory item dropping. That's the basic idea.<P>Any comments are welcome. Thanks </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>[1] Cross-Teaming<BR>=================<BR>Stop the Cross-Teaming!!! The Cross-Teaming is out of control on the Team PvP servers. Everyone is tired of hearing this assinine argument about the TZ/VZ servers being GvE. If it were GvE the servers would be called GvE Servers. The word Team denotes a team inviornment, and I think there should be some system to enforce team play.<P>Solution: If you group with a member of another team 3 things should happen.<P>- You should loose faction with your own team. (DE looses faction with ALL FACTIONS inside team towns, meaning Neriak, Oggok, Cabilis, Grobb)<P>- You should loose faction with the teams youre cross-teaming with. (DE groups with a dwarf and a human, this means he looses faction in all the towns associated with the dwarf and human teams, not to mention his own team. This would keep someone from dropping his faction in his own town because he already has good faction in another teams town, which would allow him to continue to cross team freely, with only minimal loss.<P>- Any member in the group that you just joined should loose faction with his own team factions for letting you in the group. (Human looses faction with ALL factions in towns associated with his team, meaning Freeport, Halas, Qeynos, and Erudin.)<P>=================<BR>[2] Immortal Healing<BR>=================<BR>Stop the Cross-Team Healing!!! I think just about everyone is getting tired of having a member of their own team heal someone that they are fighting. It totally unbalances the PvP Servers and creates a situation where it is impossible to win a PvP encounter.<P>Solution: Give faction hits to anyone that heals, buffs or throws any kind of a beneficial spell on someone from another team. (DE heals/buffs a player from another team, the DE looses faction in the towns associated with his team and his targets team, meaning Neriak, Oggok, Cabilis, Grobb, and any cities associated with the player he buffed/healed.)<P>======================<BR>[3] 8 Level PvP Range<BR>=====================<BR>Simply put, 8 levels is to much. I believe 4 to 5 levels at most would be sufficent, and would be much more balanced. As a caster, you would be hard pressed to land a spell on someone 8 levels higher than you, especially at higher levels due to Uber resistance gear. As a melee class you would also be hard pressed to land a blow let alone do enough damage to be effective. I think narrowing this range to 4 or 5 levels would balance out the PvP encounters much better.<P>======================<BR>[4] Starting Faction From Team Towns<BR>======================<BR>This one doesnt really effect any team except for the Dark team. As a troll I have bad faction to start with in the town of the races on my team. This pretty much goes for any race on the dark team. You immediately start with bad faction, possibly being KoS, to any town associated with your team besides your own. This disrupts the ability for anyone playing an evil character to move around, bank, buy food or items, or to stay in a group with people on your team when visiting a town. Often times some members of a group I am in have to wait outside the city away from the guards for nothing more thant the race they play. Please fix this problem on the Team Servers, as the Dark team is the only one adversely effected by this problem.<P>===================<BR>[5] GM Visibility in /who List<BR>===================<BR>Make GMs or Guides invisible or impossible to detect by players on the "/who all" list. Grief players know when to stop their training, or other grief tactics when they know a GM or Guide is in the zone. Please help GMs and Guides to deal with the grief players by doing this.<P>===================<BR>[6] Con System<BR>===================<BR>Please make the /con system show only red/white/green when conning another player. If a player is in range for me to attack, please show them as a white /con, and make everyone else either red or green. This would eliminate lots of confusion when in big fighting groups.<P>===================<BR>[7] Effect of Slowing/Rooting Spells<BR>===================<BR>Many of these spells are either overpowered or underpowered, and not much in between. It is a continual annoyance (especially for younger players) that a level 4 snare from a Druid can over write a level 12 sow. Shouldnt the sow spell be a little tougher to overpower since the sow spell is 8 levels higher? On the other hand, the cleric/shaman spell enstill is a joke. I routinely group with a shaman and cleric and they may land the spell 1 out of every 10 attempts. More often than not, when the spell does land, they get the "Your Enstill has worn off" before they get the "MoB_00 has been enstilled". Isnt that a little rediculous? Maybe some of the clerics or shamans can elaborate on this a bit.<P>===================<BR>[8] Team PvP Servers vs. GvE/LvD Servers<BR>===================<BR>There may be a demand for GvE/LvD Servers, but they should not consider converting the Team servers. These servers were Team PvP from the beginning, and anyone that joined the Team PvP servers were aware of that when they started. Just because they have changed their mind that they like a 9 on 4 PvP environment during the course of playing on the Team PvP servers, the Team servers should not be changed any more than they already have. If they didnt like the team system to begin with then they should have joined Rallos, or just played on a blue server. The silent majority of players on the team servers came to these servers because they liked the idea of a team environment. Please dont alienate use because a very vocal minority want this changed for their own personal benefit.<P>====================<BR>[9] Concessions to Players That Dont Want Risk<BR>====================<BR>Risk for the PvP servers has been minimized to the point of non-existance. There is no fear of dying anymore, which means players take risks (like sitting in front of Oggok Pking newbies) because there is no risk if they die. PLEASE CHANGE THIS!! I think it was a mistake to stop the 1 item loot rule. Because of that change Twinking, Grief Players, Cross-Teaming, and other exploits have boomed into existence, and have disrupted a balance that was doing rather nicely on its own. The 1 item loot rule was in place from the beginning, and anyone that joined the server was well aware of that when they joined, and they should be made to deal with that fact. If people dont like the 1 loot item rule, there are 30 other blue servers where they can play and never be at risk of being Pkilled, or loosing an item. All you did was alienate a population of people and destroyed any balance between the teams, by making that one change. In short...  PLEASE STOP MAKING CHANGES TO AN ESTABILISHED SYSTEM BECAUSE OF WHINERS! Make them go to blue servers instead.<P>Anyway, these are the opinions of many of the people I play with on a daily basis. I hope that some sanity can be restored to the Team PvP servers.<P>Gile Gutripper on Vallon Zek<BR>Darklight Brigade - www.oggok.com/darklight<BR>www.oggok.com - The online ogre haven</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

This needs to be looked at somehow, i'm not going to offer some lame over the top idea for it either i just want to know if ever this is going to be looked at seriously.<P>-Arkons....i think you mean chloroBlast not chloroplast.<P>-Plz all the blue server ppl don't post on this subject you have 0 experince in this field, just cause you play on a PvP server for 5 lvls doesn't mean you know whats going on.<P>-GMs...they don't help at all in cases of portal camping training whatsoever in my days of playing, whats this b/s about they have to see it, by the time they get there the ppl doin it are gone and wait till the next day or they have show eq to tell them that a gm is in zone and voila. There should be another way for gms to fix this problem, and i do know of 1 time a guide/gm saw a group of ppl train another group and NOTHING happened, to say the least get some gms that WILL DO SOMETHING.<P>Ghraf Doppleganger~CD~<BR>Rallos Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wayward you got a really thick skull.  I carry around sow potions, cure posion potions, cure diesease potions, golem wands, and crystal pumice.  Cure poison DOES NOT remove splurt or winged death.  Please be informed about game mechanics before posting a reply that targets them.  And if you recall my suggestion for a fix to DoTs was not to nerf them but to:<P>1) Make it so you had to be within a range of a target or the DoT would remove itself thus effectivly destroying the dot and run manuever. <P>or <P>2) making nullify\cancel\annul magic work like cuer poison\diesease and make it remove harmful dots before it starts removing enchantments.<P>Please quit making comments before you have fully researched them.
