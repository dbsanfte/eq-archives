</FONT><HR>As Cao stated, and many others, sneak breaking on trade-in would be a terrible nerf. No merchants buying/selling, no Epic completed, No banking.<BR>I love the chest idea and it was mentioned over a year ago and here is a my suggestion for it:<BR>locked chest drops (lore) prevent hoarding<BR>Types: <BR>1. a locked chest (LP skill 50-100)<BR>2. a sturdy locked chest (LP skill 101-160)<BR>3. a ornate locked chest (LP skill 161-200)<BR>4. a tinkered locked chest (LP skill 201+ and tinkered lockpicks)<BR>5. a ? locked chest (magically locked and require soulbound lockpicks and 201+skill)<BR>Course the treasure in the chests is up for debate.<BR>Rogue (hired or in group) is asked to open.<BR>Chest is placed in trade window<BR>Rogue clicks on chest(with picklocks-skill check vs chest type)<BR>Items and or money spawns (no more than 3-4 items) in the trade window of the person that had the chest or in that persons inventory (trade window of the person with chest better to avoid full char inventories problems)<BR>The rogue gets to see the stuff that came out of the chest but at least its not in his inventory or inventory window and then trade can be cancelled. Also for a rogue WITH a chest guess it would have to be openable from our inventory or we would have to find someone to hit trade with. (which wouldn't bother me really as it gives me a chance to place things accordingly into my inventory)<BR>I hope evade is not changed to the point of uselessness.<BR>I rather have hide/sneak work better post 50. At 55 make it immune to all but bosses,(named dragons),gods<BR>I can't for the life of me sneak around those dang bats in solb or the frog wizzies/shamans in seb.<BR>I would like to be considered useful to a group for CR as well as damage.

</FONT><HR>I am very disapointed with this list.  It ignores MANY of the critical observations/suggestions on the main talk threads (e.g. evade is not working as Absor describes), suggests a couple new nerfs, etc.    ARGH!<P>And to see NO MENTION of any reworking to make AGI/DEX more meaningful to Rogues in combat...  come on, Absor, would it make sense for Wizards to find out later that DEX was secretly their primary stat?  That's essentially what VI has done to rogues with STR.  At least take the 10 seconds it would take to HIGHLIGHT THE STAT as important at Rogue creation time.  Then at least FUTURE rogues won't get @%*()%*ed like I did.<P>How about if we have someone working on the balancing of our class that demonstrates to some extent that they've PLAYED our class.  Recently.  On a live server.  Without a twink.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Now first of all, I'm not going to mention anything about evade.  If it get's "nerfed", we will all complain, get used to it, and deal.  Why?  Cause we are all rogues.  We aren't brown-nosing, suck up, casters.  Nope, we are the underdogs.  And I actually enjoy that fact.  <P>Now on to a subject that did get my attention.  Locked boxes.  Finally a reason we should have <BR>lockpicking.  Please oh please implement this.  He are some ideas.  <BR>1. boxes as random drops off sentient type mobs.  (eg not dropping off wolves, spiders, animal types)  <P>2. Difficulty is based on the mob it was dropped by.  (eg lvl, or area, or type of mob.)  <P>3.  Contents are coin of greater value then mob usually drops, rarer items, gems, possible quest items, or something a bit more valuable than the mob usually drops.  <P>4.  A way to prevent us sneaky rogue from stealing the contents of a box we are opening for someone else.  (I had to add that or everyone else would hate the idea)<P>5.  (Most important idea) Traps.  Something that makes us use sense traps and disarm traps.  Poison traps (small needle), explosion traps (wire fuses, can blow up contents if tripped), bolt trap (small crossbow bolt aimed at disarmer), etc.<P>6.  Steps of box "popping"  <BR>must sit down<BR>1 hold box in hand<BR>2 sense traps to find out what trap is on box<BR>3 disarm trap (Success disarms trap, fail is a retry, botch sets off trap)<BR>4 Pick lock (success box unlocked, fail retry, botch lockpick breaks.)<BR>5 hand over box to owner, and hold hand out for donation.  <P>Just think about sitting at the gate in freeport or wherever saying "Popping boxes for donations"  We rogues would then have something to offer other than backstabbing.  Shammys get potions, casters get bind, buff, sow, so forth.  Rogues and bards would be able to pop boxes.  Something fun to pass the time, make money, talk to others.  Serious Role Playing.<P>Thank you<P>Tiechdair</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, I think there are a couple of items not visible in your rogue talk list, that where previously mentioned by yourself as going to be put on it.<P>Copied from the archived post at Castersrealm, http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=3201<P>"Now for other changes: <P>Bind Wounds: Skill cap pre-50 for Warriors and Rogues was 100. We are likely to be moving this to 175, with a max skill of 210. This would mean a 70% binding well before 60th level. We're also adjusting other classes caps higher as well, but in reality, only Monks, Warriors and Rogues used Bind Wounds with any frequency, and only Pure Melee and Priests will be able to bind to 70% of maximum hit points."<P>And copied from http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=3206<P>"We've also looked a few more rogue issues, and expect to have them adjusted in the following weeks. None of these are promised, keep this in mind, but we are looking into them. <P>...<P>Instill Doubt still on the same timer as it is currently, but allowing that first backstab or special attack to land after ID goes off. This will happen. Still rewards those of you with good timing."<P><BR>Both of the mentioned changes are things that made me go through the roof with joy, and now they are not on the list? I could understand on list with status "decided it was too good to be true", but to take them off altogether? These changes seemed very nice to a rogue that solos a lot.<P><BR>By the way, the only thing I mentioned, on the first page of part one of the rogue talk thread, didn't make the list either. Sigh. Not sure why it was left out, maybe it was just missed, so I add it here.<P>The question was if it was intentional that a monster could interrupt my poisoning him through bashing me immediately when attacked. The bash then hits me after the poison starts casting but before he has been poisoned by it. Has happened in two out of four poisoning attempts at sand giants for me. Once it cost me a death.<P>I feel this may be an unwanted side effect of poisons being considered spells. If it is unintentional, please consider changing it, like you changed it so we could be walking around without interrupting the poisoning attempt.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I do hope that Absor plans to come back to these threads to read our comments and suggestions.<P>These are my opinions - 50+ rogue, 60+ days played, started over a year ago - so I hope I make sense.<P>[Current Skills]<P>Evade:  I have a sneaking suspicion (no pun intended!) that Evade doesn't work exactly the way you think it does, which is why you're considering 'nerfing' it.  I'm sure you THINK you know how it works, based on reading your code and a few tests.  But I think you MAY be mistaken.  I'm gonna pull out the old 'Alchemy' reference... just because you THINK it works that way doesn't mean it DOES work that way.<P>Evade works fine as is.  If you change it, please make sure you test it thoroughly.  And, more importantly, make sure you're able to back it out if something goes wrong.  Remember, whether it works out or not, there will be a lot of people claiming it's broken.  Just do this right the first time and you won't have TOO many complaints.<P>Damage Shields and missiles:  Good, about time.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Locked Chests:  Nice idea.  Very old idea, but thanks for bringing it up to the team again.  Note, at this time there are a few locked inventory (quest) items, but we cannot pick these locks... perhaps if this idea goes through you can allow us to pick these locks as well.  Also, if it does get implemented, there should also be an option to Trap them, giving us 3 skills to take advantage of - Sense and Disarm Traps as well as Pick Locks.<P>Report Backstab messages:  As long as Special Attack messages can be filtered out, I like this idea.  No, it will NOT cause people to cry Nerf when they find out how much damage we are capable of.  Well, it will, but they won't be justified.  What, you want ANY class's damage output to be nerfed?  MOBs are tough enough as it is, don't ever try to nerf anyone's damage output - ask for increases for others, but never ever ask for anyone's abilities to be nerfed, it only hurts everyone.<P>Sneak and Hide:  Please, whatever you do, DON'T break Sneak when dealing with Merchants, turning in Quest items, or Swimming.  Breaking Hide makes sense (EXCEPT while Swimming!), but Sneak is required in some cases.  Realize that these are 2 seperate skills, no need to break one just because the other does.  Some factions are extremely difficult if not impossible for some to improve, and Sneak has worked this way since day 1 - you'll see more complaints than you know what to do with if you break Sneak.  And remember, it affects a lot more classes and races than Rogues.<P>Haste for missile weapons:  Good idea, and not unbalancing at all, especially since missile/throwing weapons are pretty much useless except for pulling (there are rare exceptions).  This would be a bonus for everyone.<P>Illusion Masks:  Not a big deal, but it would be convenient to be able to kill illusions at will.<P>Hide/sneak overwriting invisibility:  Hmm, not sure how to react to this one.  Recently I've noticed that Invisibillity spell effects were changed so that a Hidden Rogue could not have any type of Invisibility spell cast on them.  And if they Hide while invis, it breaks Invis - Hide is the most powerfull Invis 'spell' in the game, affecting both live and undead NPCs.  Maybe just double-check the code to make sure it works the way it should - I'm not 100% positive that Hiding breaks Invis succuessfully and keeps the Rogue hidden/invis.<P>Increased Safefall:  Kick it up to 100 until level 51, then maybe let it increase to 125.  I never understood where the hard cap of 94 came from, heheh.<P>Sneaking in water:  Let us start Sneak while underwater - see my previous comments.  Please do not break the Sneak skill.<P>Stackable Poisons:  Using poison at all is pretty uncommon, but you know that.  Making them stackable like Alchemy potions would be nice though.<P>Poisoning in Full Screen mode:  Never noticed, but then I've hardly used them.  Good to fix though.<P>Sneak skill increases:  Not needed, but would be nice.<P>Speed increase while hide and sneaking:  Starting the speed increase sooner would be very nice, and level 40 or so sounds good to me.  It doesn't have to ever go higher than full normal speed, and that should be somewhere between 55 and 60 in my opinion.<P>Tracking:  Um, not really needed, but a nice option if you allow it.  Would have to wait until all the Tracking enhancements have been implemented and tested for Rangers (long overdue), and limit it's use of course.  Maybe just Players, or just unnamed NPCs, or something like that.  Again, I don't feel we need this, but a limited form of Tracking could make sense.<P>Sense Traps:  I guess the addition of Range was added with Velious.  Before that, there was no Range limit.  We used to be able to sense the traps in SolB, Paw, and Timorous Deep from anywhere in the zone.  But then, of course, those traps were harmless and pointless.  If there is a Range now, increasing it would be nice, and shorten the refresh time to maybe the same as Sense Heading.<P>[Future Possibilities]<P>Stun with Backstab:  Interesting idea for a future skill.  Blunt weapons only, and probably only from behind.  We'll see.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Poison on thrown weapons:  Makes Sense, but poisoning weapons would have to be entirely revamped - we don't actually poison the weapon apparently, just the weapon slot.<P>Soulbound Lockpicks:  Nice idea, maybe from the same guy in Sol Temple that gives out the Burning Rapier quest.  Just don't make it as insanely drawn out and boring (BB Cask, anyone?).  A few more mid/high level quests (outside of Velious) for Rogues would also be cool.<P>Apply Poison Animation:  Sounds like they're already planning this for the upcoming patch - good idea.  A Backstab emote would be even better, heheh.<P>Throwing Weapons with longer range:  Good idea, would help multiple classes.<P>Set Traps:  Neato!   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Hide/Sneak across zone borders:  Long overdue!  Maybe someday.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>[Conclusions]<P>Rogues are one of the classes that are in least need of adjustments.  I'm glad they're at least trying to make improvements.  Let's cross our fingers!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I like the idea about pickable chests, but c'mon guys we are rogues.  Lets stop being honest and saying that we can have these and have our hands tied so that we can not steal any of the contents.  I know why you are saying it, but I would like or Thieveish nature to come out.  Their are some dishonest non rogue players out there.  I speak from experiance having got scammed on a sale of a bag containing magical items.  It was full of first level Paladin spells that I could not shift for love nor money, So I ended up 5pp down on the bag.<P>I had this thought, dont know if it is workable though.<P>If in a group, then the contents of the box as it is removed from, would be displayed as loot currently is.  I.E: Vortex has looted a rusty sword.  The money would be split via the split function.<P>But if not grouped then the removal of the contents would not be displayed.  Therefore characters wanting a rogue to open the box, would either not trust them and group so that they can see what was in there.  Or trust them and hope that they are honest with what they find.<P>Gives rogues a chance to roleplay themselves.<P>Ok I am going to play devils advocate for this, but it is something that I have been thinking about.<P>The thing about Warriors get their criticals displayed and Rogues dont.<P>I actually like this idea. We are rogues, we are sneaky and backstab, or backstabbing and flamboyant.<P>The warrior goes "See me I hit for a critical of 32"<P>(I'm still low level haven't climbed into the high level damage yet).<P>The rogue smiles quietly at the warrior while polishing the blood from his daggers.

</FONT><HR>I almost cannot believe what I've read here.<P>The suggestion that trading should break sneak is ludicrous. Yes, it is consistant with the hide functionality, but it is a feature that many other parts of the game have been designed around. In fact, the Rogue epic quest cannot be accomplished without it.<P>Continuous skill increase checks on Sneak are OK as it will help increase the skill, but why do I suspect that at the same time you are going to add skill checks giving the possibility that Sneak will drop unexpectedly. This would change sneak/hide from the very best invisibility in the game due to its reliability into the most useless ability due to the slow speed of sneaking. Please do not do that.<P>As for sneaking in water, I like the idea of making it consistent. Do not however take away the ability to sneak in water altogether please. Instead give us the ability to begin sneaking in water. If sneak breaks when touching water, it can be considered nothing but a NERF. None of what I've accomplished by being able to sneak in water seems overbalancing to me, but such a NERF would make swamp-style zones and places like Upper Guk off limits to the rogue.<P>Kneeling instead of sitting to apply poison. I thought I read somewhere that this was possible and likely to happen.

</FONT><HR>I am unsure how you read all the rogue thread and came up with this list.  Seems to be some major reduction in rogues hide/sneak abilities and evading in exchange for some minor bug fixes and some 'window dressing' things (Yippie they can see my backstab hits now &lt;--sarcasm).  Here are the main issues one more time to be ignored again I am sure.<P>1) In Many Many circumstances invisibility is superior to hide/sneak (move spd, across zones, link death, underwater).  This is compounded by the fact that many classes get invis...some in the single digit levels.  Rogues are the masters of stealth. Right now we give up as much or more stealth abilities as we gain.  <P>Easy Solution: Give rogues an invis casting item semi available in their 40s.<P>2)Poison in its current incarnation is a massive time and money sink hole with very very limited uses.  The sheer number of components and the amount of greenie farming this skill requires is just staggering.  The only place that this skill is useful is in PvP...and then only if you apply the poison before a fight begins.<P>Easy Solution: Apply poison should always work (there are enough failures involved in making and mobs resisting).  Apply skill from 50-100 should result in faster apply times (Down to 3.5 secs or so).  Apply skill 101-200 should have a 50% chance of not using up the poison.  Apply skill 251 should have a 66% chance of not using up a poison.<P>3) Rogues and Warriors are totally handicapped when they have an hour or 2 to play.  The time it takes to travel and find a group willl usually use up all their time.  At these times we would like to be able to solo (low low blues) and not have to wait 30 min to heal up.  We need bind wounds to cap above 200 before lev 60.<P>Easy solution: make the bind wounds cap 201 post 50.<P>4) "ITEM: Evade. DESCRIPTION: Evade was broken when the size of the hate list was expanded for NPCs. It has to be fixed this in such a way that there won't be too much of a change from the way that Evade worked prior to the hate list change. This will, however, 'nerf' the skill a bit compared to how it works now."<P>If you wanted to "FIX" evade to how it used to work before the hate list was expanded...you would make evade put rogues at a point equal to the bottom of the old hate list (6 or 12 is my guess). Your latest proposal would put rogues in the number 2 hate spot...this is not a "Nerf to the skill compared to how it works now" , it is a massive nerf compared to how it was before you claimed it was broken.<P>Easy Solution:  Make evade put rogues at a point equal to the bottom of the old hate list.<BR>               <BR>                    OR<P>Tell us the true reason you want to nerf this ability.  We know its not to put it back to its old functionality.  Common guys, cut the Crap.  To quote a Verant Employee "If it looks like a Duck...".<P>Thx for your Time<BR>Dusk Nightwolf<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>After reading this post I just want to shake my head. After reading the host of improvements suggested for the other classes it is hard to believe. <P>I would rather nothing in the improvement list get implemented. The nerfs to sneak/hide and evade suggested are terrible and nothing comes close to compensating for them. Over all, I would prefer to be left alone as a class. If everything on your list came to pass it would be a net rogue nerf.<P>The good stuff suggested by the comunity is NA.<BR>The rest is window dressing.<BR>Again- Evade does not work like you think it does. EVADE DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY. Please leave it alone. And please leave the sneak/hide with vendors alone also.<P>One good suggestion that should be on the list- can we have a VENDOR for the common poison components? This was not mentioned. Farming greens for hours is NOT FUN. This is a game, can we keep this kind of boring make work to a minimum? </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I know that Verent tries for the best but they do not know what they are doing. EVADE DOES NOT WORK THE WAY YOU THINK IT DOES!!!!  In my own experience (31 rogue) evade works only about 1/3 or the time.  This is not great but still usefull.  Sometimes when it does work the baddie will be right back on us.  Added to this the games thinks we are moving when we are not takes down the utility.  IT WORKS!  Please listen.<P>Do not change Sneak/Hide.  Sneak/Hide is THE rogue defining ability, more then poisen more then Backstab the ability to sneak and hide is what makes use more then just weak warriors.  Do not mess with that.<P>Changing the backstab from strength to dexterity is a must.  It makes no sense how it is now and is rather cheep on your part.  You told us that dexterity was one of our major prerects and that strangth was not and in reality it is the other way around.  Giving Backstab damage as a tell to the group?  So what.  It ok if you do it is ok if you do not.<P>Having a forage for poisen conponets?  Think on it. Poisen is worthless right now.  Having to spend 5pp to kill a monster that only drops 2 pp is a major loss on the rogues part.  Still it might be unbalanceing.<P>Locked chests.  Sound interesting.  There may be bugs but it could be usefull.  It would in no way however make up for our losses in evade and sneak.<P>You are right the N/A is a wish list but is would LOVE to see set traps.<P>P.S you might want to relook at my own changes to Backstab if you are going to change evade.  It would fix SOME of our complaints.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hello,<BR>First a little background on me.<BR>I worked for Sega of America game testing, I know how to find bugs and exploits. So here we go.<BR>First I tested the Evade bug. <BR>Test Subject: (cons blue)Frost Giant in eastern wastes.<BR>Me: level 40 rogue <BR>Me and my bud have killed alot of giants before in groups so he has bad faction and so do I.<BR>I ran up to the frost giant BS was 175, and then a couple attacks. I evaded 6 times before having to be healed and running to zone. When I was healed and gaint snared it turned on druid. This was noted.<P>Next try. Same set up new plan.<BR>Druid snared giant 3 times, I ran up behind it and started the attack. Druid started kiting not nuking only snaring. I kept evading and it only turned on me once when druid fizzled, I evaded<BR>and giant turned on druid. This was also to be noted. I started my attack agian and couple seconds later giant was dead.<P>Conclusion: This would seem like a problem, because a druid with snare gloves and a rogue of Level could kite giants non-stop. <P>Exploit: Most rogues would like this, Since the druid is doing no damage, and the druid and rogue arn't grouped mind you. The rogue would get all the exp. This would seem like the ultimate powerlevel. Also with the gloves it would have little or no down time.<P>Thank you. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Can anyone explain to me why Rogues cannot feign death? Aren't we supposed to be the cunning masters of deception? Its not like this would unbalance the class, or make us the best to play, seeing as it would appear we are going to get screwed over by VI according to this list. Have any of the development team ever played a rogue? One of them should go out and make a rogue, and put all their points into agi and dex like they told us to do, and then see how long they last soloing, since we sure as hell have the 2nd hardest time finding groups, next to, in my experience, bards (Odd, since all their songs are group effect.. but I digress).<P>I also find it odd that Rogues get less safefall cap then monks.. Why have the rogues on this message board backed down on this issue? "Oh, maybe not as much as monks" on the safe fall cap raising.... Uhh... I thought we were theives.. I'm sorry I didn't realize your average rl Monk was a master at flinging himself from roof to roof.<P>Overall, if you nerf evade, I am going to be severly harassing every GM I can find online about getting us FD, since that skill, according to VI isn't unfair, even though it convinces most mobs that the monk doesn't even exist, let alone on their hate list.. Lord.. I am sorry that us rogues don't kiss up as much, or that we maybe complain the most of any class, but MAYBE THERE IS A REASON FOR IT! Warriors get the best peircers, and we can't have em, monks get the best ability to avoid combat, even though we deserve that... the list goes on.<P>Status: None &lt;--- What does this mean?<P>Trasnlation: "Oh, I'm sorry, guys, this is a GM telling you that my Ranger and Bard characters need to be better now, so I figure I will work really hard on making them better then any class, and to make up for it, screw over rogues.." That about the size of it Verant? You nerf us (the most broken class in the world) and fix rangers (Why not just give them wizard offensive spells, and the ac of a warrior while you're at it!) or the other casters and you can count yourself 10$ short a month. There are plenty of other games around, why would I play one that wants to make my char class even worse!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Changing the level that it does drop you to... when it actually works... will turn the rogue into a low hp meatshield.  If VI decides to change our only real 'defense' skill... then PLEASE raise our Hp's, innate AC (agi bonus), or give us higher damage piercing weapons.<P>I would like to see more piercing weapons implented in the game.  Not neccessarily higher damage... just something other than SBD's, Dragoon's, Stilleto's....<P>I like the idea of rogue tracking... but maybe something like "Shadowing"... small area tracking list.. but the ability to target a specific mob and be able to 'shadow' it.  So, if said mob gets out of sight.. the rogue still knows which direction it went.<P>As to why damage shields affect thrown weapons is beyond me.  Must be REAL long flames or thorns..<P>Last point...

</FONT><HR>OK.  Few points I'd like to make.  Oh, by the way, I started EQ last December with a rogue, got to 11 and started another rogue in April.  Been playing him and finally broke 20 a few weeks ago.  Basically, I've been playing rogues for over a year; although the levels might not show it.<P>1) Do not, under ANY circumstances cause Sneak to break when selling/banking/trading with NPCs.  It would seriously cause some problems within the rogue community.<P>2) Don't mess with Evade.  I see no problems with it.<P>3) The Damage Shields hitting with throwing/archery is a bit ridiculous, but afterall, the shields are magically.  Never can tell what will happen with magic.<P>4) Locked chests are a good idea.  Might give rogues a way to make cash by breaking them open for people.  Kind of like going to Befallen and opening doors for donations like I've done before.<P>5) Illusion masks' effects being able to be dropped.  It would be nice if you could.  Never owned one, but the illusions might (don't know for sure) make you KoS to some races.<P>6) Safefall's cap should be increased.  Maybe to that of monks.  Think about it.  Which do you think you'd see jumping off of a roof?  A thief or a monk?<P>7) Easy way to make stackable poisons: a potion(poison) bag like that for Shaman potions.  Put X number of poison in a bag, click combine, get 1 poison with X number of charges.<P>8) Now for the one I've been REALLY wanting to post on.  I'm going to expand on inda's idea of the sleeping powder, sand, etc.  A potter makes a small, hollow ball (new sketch/recipe needed), the rogue put the ball and powder components in Mortar & Pestle.  When combined, a ball of "such and such" is produced (stackable item hopefully).  The ball is put in ranged slot.  When it hits mob the spell takes effect.  I'm not sure how the mechanics of the game works, and I don't know if the spell "going off" on contact is possible.  Of course, it could be turned into a new skill if you wished.  Maybe for rogues and monks...maybe bards too.  Same basic idea, and the rogues could sell the "dust balls" to the other classes that can use it.<P>9) The soulbound lockpicks is a good idea.  Could be a good mid-level quest.<P>10) Being able to stun with backstab by using a 1H Blunt isn't that bad of an idea.  If I recall correctly, there is already a blackjack in EQ.  And, if anyone has ever played Thief or Thief 2, the blackjack is very usefull.  Knocks opponents out when used from behind.  The stun time could increase with level.  Starts out at 1-2 at level 20 (don't want level 10's going around stunning things do we?) and maxes out at 1-6 seconds at level 60.  That's a 1 second increase per level.  Not too much, but useful with fighting.  Might need to do something about duel wielding.  A rogue with a piercer and 1H Blunt could be dangerous and would probably get complaints from some of the "brown-nosing" classes.<P>11) One last thing, I promise.  Make poison making more worth while.  You either have to spend thousands of plat on upping your pottery skill to make vials, or chuck out a good bit on vials.  Not to mentiong the suspensions.  Plus, "greenie farming" isn't that fun--not to mention the numerous complaints from low levels about you taking their kills.  The leader/highest level rogue in my guild flat out said:<P>"Actually Zerk, after thinking about all the time and trouble I went through and all the Plat it costed me to get better at a skill that I wouldnt even bother with now..... see where I'm going with this.....<P>Save your money bro.

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>DO NOT NERF THE SNEAK SKILL!!!!<BR>Because you so rarely listen to the vital requests of the people who actually know from experience what they're talking about, allow me to repeat.<BR>DO NOT NERF THE SNEAK SKILL!!!!<BR>DO NOT NERF THE SNEAK SKILL!!!!<BR>Now, I'll explain to you why nerfing the Sneak skill is even worse of an idea than nerfing our Evade skill (that one's next. trust me on this). First, let's talk about merchants. In the 7 months I've been playing, I can tell you that about 95% of the merchants I've come across have all conned dubious to me, and as a result would not sell to me. These merchants include all of Antonica, Odus, parts of Kunark, most of my home continent (I'm a Wood Elf Rogue). Disabling Sneak when speaking to any of these merchants would result in my complete unability to trade with these merchants. Which means if I ever had to go to a merchant for food, water, bandages, or to sell loot, I'd have to go to Firiona Vie, Kelethin, or Thurgadin. And considering I do most of my hunting in Antonica, it's a very long trip that I don't want to make. So, please, once again, I ask you... DO NOT NERF THE SNEAK SKILL!!!!<BR>As for our Epic. Since you've nerfed our epic quest so many times, making it the biggest pain in the rear end I've ever had to deal with *coughELDRETHcough* Imagine how bad it would be to have to walk up to the Dark Elf spawn in Kithicor Woods, Put the box into her trading screen, have Sneak become disabled, and then be promptly killed. And since using Sneak is the only way to Do that Vital, General Spawning trade, you would have successfully destroyed the entire Rogue Epic Quest. So, on behalf of all Rogues, I ask you... PLEASE DO NOT NERF THE SNEAK SKILL!!!!<P>Now, allow me to explain why it is a bad idea for you to Nerf our evade skill. And believe me, you're doing a lot of unnecessary damage to the Entire Rogue community by doing so. This is indeed one of the worst decisions you've made as far back as I can see.<BR>First of all, my survival has been tremendously dependant upon my ability to Evade. And there have been a vast number of times where evade has failed because of one of two things: 1) I was hit momentarily before evading, and recieved the "you must be standing perfectly still...etc" or 2) it just outright failed, resulting in the message "Your attempts to clear combat have failed". And regardless of what YOU may believe, it's incredibly easy to have Evade fail 3+ consecutive times. I've had it fail so many times in one battle that it gets to the point where I just decide to go ahead and tank the mob. Needless to say, I don't do it very well, and the cleric is never happy about it. But hey, after 5 or so consecutive failures of a skill that fails often, what can you do? by that time, the mob's almost dead, and evading becomes pointless. But let's say that it's one of those fights where Evade actually does succeed? In the case of shardwurms in Velious, it doesn't matter. The mob will continue bashing me just like it had been before. In normal circumstances, Within a few seconds, or my next backstab, whichever is first, I'll be tanking the mob again, anyway. And mind you, this is BEFORE you nerf Evade. If you nerf it in the manner you describe, Evade will become virtually worthless. Sure, it'll let me get someone else on top of the aggro list shortly before turn around and head to the zone, but is this the way you intended Evade to be used? Probably not, but that's how it will be. So, that's why I ask you PLEASE DO NOT NERF EVADE!!!!<BR>because IT DOES NOT WORK THE WAY YOU THINK IT DOES!!!!<BR>Once again, because you rarely listen to those that you should listen to, allow me to repeat those last parts...<BR>PLEASE DO NOT NERF EVADE!!!!<BR>IT DOES NOT WORK THE WAY YOU THINK IT DOES!!!!<P>That's about all for now. If you decide to do anything else that will end up completely devastating my class, I'll be sure to let you know.<P>With the greatest of Sincerity,<P>Maldicion Del'Borracho<BR>Mithaniel Marr<P>PS: For reasons of redundancy, I've decided to refrain from asking you to NOT nerf Sneak and Evade.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I think they will add alot of versatility to the roleplayers,as the Iksar are outcasts and only been discovered lately,they can fall under any of the "old" rogue definitions: scouts,assassins.Who would you send to the new continent if you were an Iksar? your warriors and spellcasters first? or your scouts/assassins to do some recon?<BR>I heard what Verant said about the Iksar being a proud race and will not welcome rogues into their colture,but really,what self respecting race will? will a wood elf or a gnome will? I can see no "thieves",but no assassins or scouts seems wrong to me.<BR>And if you say no Iksar rogues,be consistent atleast, as the first thing I saw when I came out of Cabilis was: An Iksar Bandit  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>three points here (just like on my bard post - i'm getting set in my ways)<P>1) Evade in reality is a lot less successful than evade in theory - i play a rogue  most every night and it is really funny how much aggro i get by standing and NOT attacking <P>I know what you are saying Evade is SUPPOSED to do but I really don't think it is doing what it you think it does.<P>2) how about letting us put some poison on aweapon and sell it to someone or how about poisoning other peoples weapons - maybe there is a trade skill there for us? anyway this is strictly wish list stuff.<P>3) i think sneak speed rate should go up steadily from the level it is attained to the max level.  I've been sneaking with my rogue for around 20 levels , I should be slightly better at it that someone just wandering out of the trainers.<P>4) ooh i have a last idea - if you backstab from hiding it should always hit. and by hiding i mean being successfully hidden at the beginning of a fight but not due to a successful evade. this just seems to make sense and adds some strategy to the scouting role.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Rogues:<BR>ITEM:  Evade.<BR>RESPONSE: This I can understand. The way you originally explained it Absor, made perfect sense. You should probably restate that here… I would, but I can't find it in my temp files.<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Damage Shields and missiles.<BR>RESPONSE: This I can sorta see. Only because of the range for most of the throwing weapons is SO short. Although I would say a longer range would have been a better solution.<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Locked Chests.<BR>RESPONSE: This is a Great Idea. This is what rogues should have been able to do in the game for a longtime.<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Report Backstab messages to the group.<BR>RESPONSE: Other then bragging, or flavor to a fight, I see nothing really beneficial from this idea.<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Sneak and Hide functionality.<BR>RESPONSE: NO! This is one of the primary bonuses of a rogue, to be the dark, secretive person. The shady figure conducting trade, black-market style, in the back of a shop. Or sneaking into a bank to secretively deposit their "acquired" wares in a safety box, until the "heat" cools so they can pawn them off.<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Haste for missile weapons.<BR>RESPONSE: This also sounds like a great Idea!<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Illusion Masks.<BR>RESPONSE: This was something I've wondered about for a while. I figured it to be a bug, that was working as intended.<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Hide/sneak overwriting invisibility.<BR>RESPONSE: This is also something I've wondered about. It should be that a rogue hiding and sneaking wouldn't be affected by such effects, then again, it can be viewed opposite also, that because these effects are magical, they override the natural ability.<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Increased Safefall.<BR>RESPONSE: Safefall from heights is something attributed to rogues, more so then monks. The catburglar that has to jump down a few stories, the rogue who has to make a hasty retreat from a city's wall.<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Sneaking in water.<BR>RESPONSE: Is this really that much of an issue? How would you sneak in water at all?<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Stackable Poisons.<BR>RESPONSE: This SHOULD occur. I can't understand how potions were fixed, and poisons weren't.<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Poisoning in Full Screen mode.<BR>RESPONSE: This should be fixed.<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Sneak skill increases.<BR>RESPONSE: Sounds reasonable… Should have to make checks,  after all, there could be a loose stone, or a twig that the rogue didn't at first see. <BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Speed increase while hide and sneaking.<BR>RESPONSE: Not sure if this is really cool. Isn't that one of the things that is affiliated with becoming an elite rogue (aka post 50). Can always get a sow or jboots to help with speed for hide/sneak pre-50.<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Tracking.<BR>RESPONSE: NO! As a person who plays a ranger as a main, I'm beginning to feel that their purpose in a group is starting to drop. Tracking is something that is associated with rangers, druids I could understand, to the limit that they have it. This will probably rile some bards, sorry to all my friends, but why were bards given tracking? This is the only reason the issue arisen with rogues. I wouldn't have a problem, except, the tracking caps given to these other classes, makes their tracking Much better then a ranger, who still tracks stuff across a zone or multiple levels below/above them in a dungeon, but nothing within sight of them, or just out of sight.. Making a ranger's tracking useless, other then to see if a named is up (somewhere) in a zone. I hate using this as a "class whine" It just seems the more you try to vary classes, the more it ruins others. One question, what purpose would a rogue have for tracking/stalking in a city? Sure, in fantasy roleplaying, there is plenty, but in EQ? A good solution to this, to give rogues tracking ability, more like Stalking, would be to make it to where they could ONLY stalk players. This still seems a bit a twist for pvp, but would more appropriately reflect what a rogue would stalk.<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Sense Traps.<BR>RESPONSE: This does need to be worked with, especially concerning false floors (pit-traps)<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Stun with Backstab.<BR> RESPONSE: This is a great idea. Gives the impression of the mugger with a blackjack in my mind. The silent, non-deadly thief.<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Poison on thrown weapons.<BR>RESPONSE: This is an awesome idea… If this shows to be possible, will we be able to see the ability to also have poison applied to arrows and bolts?<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Soulbound Lockpicks.<BR>RESPONSE: Soulbound anything is still a flaky idea in my opinion, but I can see it's usefulness in the way of dungeon deaths and corpse recovery. However for lockpicks, is going to a bank in the city the rogue is bound in, and withdrawing the money to buy another set of lockpicks, really that much of an issue? Lockpicks won't break a person who's at the level to use them.<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Apply Poison Animation.<BR>RESPONSE: Good idea for adding more flavor… nothing practical for this though.<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Throwing Weapons.<BR>RESPONSE: This would be the solution to the damage shield affecting thrown weapons, as I mentioned above. Makes plenty sense. Why are so many thrown weapons, at this time, still ranged less then a MOB's melee radius?<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Set Traps.<BR>RESPONSE: This I can see adding a unique twist to the game, however I also see it being used in bad ways (but creative) ways on a pvp server… Imagine a rogue setting about 50 traps (no risk) in an area, and then attacking someone, and run through that area (avoiding traps) Then when the person they are fighting runs through, BOOM! Instant death. This could be done with large boss mobs too. Anyonw with the time and patience could set up an entire area to "kite" the boss mob through, letting it set off all the traps, basically killing it with little to no risk. This is a great idea to add for rogues, but it should be thought out well before implementing.<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Hide/Sneak across zone borders.<BR>RESPONSE: This Needs to be done.

</FONT><HR>You have to be very careful with Nerfing evade. Rogie with high damage peircing weapons will be in DIRE jeaprody if evade gets changed. As is it right now, a Rogue with Ragebringer is on the top of the list, and Warriors are unable to taunt off them. I cant imagine a Rogue with RB not returning back to the ol mana sponge of the old days.<P>Just to remind you, one of the reasons Rogues had a tough time grouping was their inability to take damage. Clerics and healers would be drained trying to keep the Rogue alive. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000456-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000456.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000456-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000456-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum13&number=13&thisthread=000456&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum13&number=13&thisthread=000456&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
