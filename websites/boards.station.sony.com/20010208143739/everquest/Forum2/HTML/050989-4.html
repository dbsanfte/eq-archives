</FONT><HR>Something that I think is really needed is equipment that makes a difference to our effectiveness. <BR>Elemental Focus Items:<P>All of these would be basicly increases in specialization for a certain element. Preferably quested for at or around level 40.<P>Now I have seen many people recommend this, but their versions cause the DD's to do more damage. But what about just giving a Bonus to Specailization. For instances a Staff of Fire Mastery, would make Conflaguration take %10 less mana and cast 10% faster. If possible these bonuses could even just increase specailization so you are still subject to a skill check. There for it won't work everytime you cast.<P>Harvest was a good addition, but like it was said above becomes useless at higher levels. A Harvest II would be nice post 50. That way if you want to use it, you lose another spell slot. <P>Right Clickable DD equipment all have rediculous casting times, these items are not at all easy to get, but the casting times make them useless for the most part at the level you get them. <P>More wizard only Right Clickable items would also help, or should I say More Obtainable. That way when we are OOM after 2 mins in that 45 Minute battle, we can still contribute a little. There are some nice items, Solsist Icy Wand, then the PoG robe. But what about items for the 40 levels in between?<P>Mana efficiency is the key. I really think Focus items are the way to go. This way there is a quest involved to get them, and we lose a hand slot, thus losing stats. And unlike mages we have to keep ours equiped for as long as we intend to get the bonus.<BR>This way Verant can justify making us better, with some negatives. Getting a flat out increase in efficiency isn't going to happen. They don't realize that by adding better weapons to the game they are making some classes more efficient because they didn't change the classes themselves, but the net result is the same.<P>Arctosia Soul'Blaze &lt;Arctos Syndicus&gt;<BR>51 Wizard - Rodcet Nife<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I just had a brain storm that I would like to point out.  Over reading the posts here and playing my own wizard...I would like to discuss the subject on the dam wizards do in Velious...rather...the lack of dam we do.  I know that wizards are not a pet class.  I would hate to think I had a pet to back me up...the whole thing goes against the Wizard class.  What I might suggest however is possibly put something in the story line with velious to where wizards "evolved" into a pet class.  This would obviously be a "velious only" spell and only be able to be used in that area.  There have been several options as like doing a certain % of dam of the mob.  Where this may be a great idea, it might not be feasible.  Just wanted to throw in another idea.<P>Itelar (52 Erudite Channeler)<BR>Raleti (51 Iksar Disciple)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wizard group portals are not in line with druid group portals.  Druids can access all the original world after their first circle of group teleports.  Wizards can not group teleport anywhere near Freeport until their second spell circle.  Even then,  Nek forest is not the safest place to port lower level people.<P>Wizards get no unique look until very high levels.  All other classes have robes or armour that has a unique look to it.<P>Wizard quests have mostly all no drop rewards that use nodrop components.  This is far different that most other classes.  This means a Wizard must do all of his/her own quest while others can buy thier stuff.  Of course having no-drop stuff is an advantage in PvP,  but PvP is a very small part of the community.<P>The whole "sight" line of spells are useless.  They don't do what they are supposed to do for the most part.  The only effect you get is a magnify.<P>Wizards have very little to look forward to beyond level 51.  There is no greatly improved spell for them.  By 51 we pretty much peak for single spell damage (Ice Comet),  Mana Efficent spell, fast casting, and lower resist spell.  Due to issues with getting the Cazic Thule skin,  many don't really care to even try for there EPIC quest.<P>Wizards are not needed for anything except to get to Plane of Hate and Plane of Sky(Air).  When you compare the amount of damage a Wizard can do in 1 hour to ANY other class,  the Wizard is below 50%. This is because we can do nothing but direct damage.  We really only have 2 choices low damage/low resist or high damage/high resist.  In either case,  we use our mana up and can no longer contribute.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

There is then a switch, where wizard's travel and druid's damage are their secondary emphasis, and where they are second only to each other (for the most part). &lt;<P>This is about balance.  Wizards are NOT the masters of fast damage, rogues are.  And they do it without mana.  A wizard is also consistently outdamaged by an equivalent-level mage and his pet in a shorter period of time.  So wizards are (at best) in third place here.<P>Someone once called us the masters of Divination but that isn't true either.<P>This class needs serious help.  Lures and Harvest and Concussion were baby steps in the right direction, but wizards right now still aren't balanced with other damage dealers, and there is very little payoff for the difficult early levels.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I just think it is sad that i can't contribute in the Big Velious Mob fights.  I started playing a wiz and endured being the most in-efficient and unwanted class in casual play, because i like the idea of being a wizard.  I thought that once i caught up to my high level friends i would be able to contribute something, but after doing dragons it looks like my day in the sun is over.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor you said:<BR>--------------------<BR>Poster-<BR>Ports: If teleportation is supposed to be our 'class defining' ability, why do Druids get more ports in better locations and earlier than Wizards? Damn right this is class envy- they're stepping all over our turf. <P>Absor-<BR>This isn't a contest. Druids are supposed to be the masters of travel. Wizards the master of fast damage. There is then a switch, where wizard's travel and druid's damage are their secondary emphasis, and where they are second only to each other (for the most part). And, well, class envy will never win you any points in a discussion with me. But at least you admit it. <P>--------------<P>Class envy aside, educate me on class roles.  From everquest.com, as authentic as it gets. Absor, this is the information we used to first choose and create our characters.  Your company told us the game rules, who does what and where and we decided to play along.  Things changed and people are sore out of luck.<P>------------------------<BR>Druid <BR>A Druid is completely at home in the outdoors, and is a friend to all animals. Because of this, no animal will ever attack him unless first attacked by the Druid. They are spellcasters whose focus is all things natural, allowing them to call upon nature for aid. They share some woodland skills with their Ranger brothers.<P><BR>Wizard <P>Wizards are the master seekers of knowledge, and their talents and spells are focused on this goal. They use powerful spells to not only see things from afar, but to transport them there as well. This thirst for arcane knowledge has also made them the true masters of the strongest form of defense: offensive spells of pure destruction. In their ability to do magical damage, they have no rivals.<BR>-------------------<P><BR>Where does it say Druid's are kings of ports?  In fact i see absolutely no reference at all about druid ports.  I do however notice focus about ports for the Wiz.  In fact most would say since the begining of time wizards in fantasy settings EVERYWHERE possess ability like this.     <P>I also notice this line, the INFAMOUS LINE:<P>"This thirst for arcane knowledge has also made them the true masters of the strongest form of defense: offensive spells of pure destruction. In their ability to do magical damage, they have no rivals."<P>Please Absor you or another company rep please tell us on this board that the wizard currently complies with that INFAMOUS line above. If it does then magic must really be pathetic in the land of norath since logs show melee'rs (not to mention other casters) break that quote in 999 pieces.<P>Dont nerf others, dont make us gods. Just stick to the class roles so we can be unique.  We need to do more dmg, to makes us comply with out class definition.  We need to be able to port and travel well.  This makes life easier for others as well.<P>Lowering evocation spell cost and increasing mana regeneration would go a long way to fixing some of these problems.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Ok, here's why I stopped playing my 52 Wizard, and started playing a warrior, who has almost caught up with my Wizard, and is 500 times more fun to play.<P>Pre-Kunark - My wizard was great!  I was (IMO) what a Wizard should be.  I was the 911.  When a situation went bad, I was the one to root one or two mobs out of the way, and help the group by bring the mobs down quickly.  If there were too many for that, I could evac.  I was a hero!  I was a guardian angel!  I was needed in a group, but more importantly, I was WANTED in a group.  I would get tells asking if I wanted to join groups.<P>Kunark - The mobs are tougher, meaning I have to use more mana, and spend more time on my rump medding.  I'm still good at taking mobs down quickly, though so are a couple of other classes.  For dungeon crawling, I'm not very usefull, since killing mobs quickly and advancing deeper into the dungeon is key.  You must advance before the mobs that you just killed respawn.  Unfortunately, after a few mobs, I must med for several minutes, taking me out of several fights, slowing down the group, and causing resentment.  While I med, I add absolutely nothing to the group.  Melee/Clreics/Pet Classes start to talk about how much down time Wizards have.  However, we're still needed on Uber mobs (Lure spells), and since these are the point to some dungeon crawls, they keep us around for the big showdown, knowing we will land spells that other casters can't.  For some reason, all classes except Int casters have Uber weapons/armor dropping in almost every zone.  People are getting items that are right-clickable, allowing them to use certain class specific abailities mana-free for a slightly extended casting time.  Some can nuke mana-free, non-stop for hours, if need be.  Others can heal mana-free for hours if need be.  We got Manaskin, which is 1 extra point of mana per tick.  This regen rate is not even close to what Wizards require to be helpful in a group.  Wizards start wondering why they are outdamaged by melee classes, yet melee classes can be ready for the next fight with 1 heal spell.  There is nothing that can do this for Wizards.  Manastones are nerfed, so that casters cannot use them in Kunark, or the Alternate Planes.  Melee armor is created to give hit point regen to make them even more viable in a group, thus making Wizards even less wanted.  This equipment is then placed in zones where a melee character can get it in a pickup group.  Non-Int casters can equip themselves with unbelievable equipment, because it falls in common zones, such as Karnor's Castle and Sebilis.  Wizards have to kill God's or Dragons to get comparable loot.  Warrior kills Drolvarg in a pick up group, warrior get's boots.  Wizard arranges a raid to go kill the Efreeti Lord, and wins the random against all other Int/Wis casters who agreed to come after 3 months of begging, and 2 real life death threats complete with a mail bomb to show he's serious, Wizard get boots.  This is not balanced, and it angers me when Verant representatives try to say that it is.<P>Velious - Mob hit points are increased so that anything above a snow cougar has God-like hit points.  50+ Wizards can only do 6% damage to the big mobs IF every single one of their most mana efficient spells hit.  This fact is only know by those in Uber guilds, since those of us who are not in Uber guilds have never been invited on a Velious raid, and WILL never be invited on a Velious raid.  They know that we cannot do much damage to these mobs, so they don't even let us in their groups.  Wizards cannot solo in Velious.  Mobs of lower levels than Kunark or Pre-Kunark have twice as many hit points, so they give no experience, AND you run out of mana trying to kill them, so you don't even get a few Platinum Pieces for your time.<P>Wizards are forced to stay in Kunark and old EQ, even though they paid their $20 for Velious like everyone else.  Melee has hit point regen comming out the ears.  Other classes have mana regen, hp to mana conversion, pets, or melee skills.  Warriors can cast spells with Armor and Weapons, I can't melee.  Clerics can do 70%+ of the damage a Wizard does, I can't heal, or cast any spells beneficial to the group. Rogues outdamage Wizards, I can't go non-stop, pick locks, hide and sneak, use poison.  Monks can hit non-stop, I cannot fight or feign death.  The list goes on and on.  <P>Verant thinks that Wizards are "balanced" because everyone can do the same amount of damage in a short period of time once they are 50+, but they are forgetting that spell damage is all we have!  That's it!  If you're serious about balance, make us do more damage!  If you aren't going to do that (and I can see you're not, by the Absor post that said that Verant is not going to add/change any spell lines) then the only other option is to give us 30% better melee ability and mana regen, to "balance" us with Warriors, give us healing that is 70%+ as effective as a Cleric, give us mana free DD weapons and armor, give us the SKILL to levitate, and the SKILL to go invis, give us shielding spells that raise our AC to 750, and our hitpoints to 1700.<P>You see, Absor, it is annoying that you ask what will balance us, and then shoot down every idea as if Wizards are God's gift to EvreQuest.  Wizards are THE hardest class to level.  We die every 2 minutes at lower levels, praying that one day we'll be powerful.  It used to be that way, but with Kunark and Velious, you guys have "balanced" Wizards out of the game.  It further angers me that do not see the problem with Wizards, and that you don't care to take up any REAL issues, only the small issues.  Verant turned EverQuest into 90% melee, and guess what?  After a year and a half, I jumped on the melee bandwagon.  YOU WIN.  I'm playing a Warrior now, and I have NO downtime.  I have weapons that cast spells, and a breastplate with Hit Point regen.  I have AC through the roof, and adding AC and other stats is as easy as killing a Velious Snow Cougar, or Orc.  I'm asked to join groups all the time.  I'm asked to come on raids all the time.  People want me now!  AND I can go into any zone and walk around like I own the place, because if I'm adventuring by myself, and peek in a room, and aggro 2 or 3 mobs, I'll make it to the zone.  Binding isn't a problem, getting a teleport or a SoW isn't a problem.  90% of the time, if a weapon or item drops off a mob, I can use it!  If balance means that you felt there were too many casters in the game, then you're doing well with balancing it, because people are dropping their casters left and right.<P>You may not believe that Wizards are broken, but then again, Verant didn't beieve Lure's were broken until the Wizzards complained for weeks.  Where's that programmer that actually ran the tests on Lure's, and discovered that they REALLY WERE BROKEN?  Can we talk to him about Wizards in Velious, please?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>ABSOR<P>I think, overwhelmingly there is a reoccuring theme here.  The Wizards of Norath feel screwed.  We had tough low levels, mid levels we are barely distinctive from any other nuking class, and were outdamage tick for tick by pet/nuke combo, and high levels we still are outdamaged tick for tick, weak vs SoV Uber Mobs and not a good contributer to average groups.  We are NOT Nit-picking here, these are concerns wizards have been bringing up for ages.  Only class redeemer at this point?  AoE groups (nearly impossible to find) and Quad-Kiting (nerf inc?).  I really hope you do nerf quad kiting  because then there will be NOTHING that a wizard can do that another class wouldn't fill the role better as.<P>Kudos for Verant:<BR>Lures!<BR>Harvest (But I think most Wizards think that this needs to be 1/2 to 1/4 the recast time to be truely a balancer)<BR>These forums!<P>/boggle Verant<BR>An mana inefficient damage shield O'kiels flickering flame (costs the same as a mages 25 point one)<BR>Rain on pets, rain resist rates.<BR>Fizzles, fizzles, fizzles.<BR>Wizard in game role.<P>Heck not sure if you'll read this, but I truely believe that Wizards are the class most out of wack at this point, and have been for a while.  Yes, there are some exceptions, Kunark Raids, at least until the Lure changes, and quad-kiting (bleh!) but a class needs more than that to be a valuable contribution.  That's all we want, to be a valued contribution.  Give us that and problem solved.<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Let wizards have more in the bolt line of spells.  I personally love the challege of having to line it up or make a hook shot or whatever to make a more damage.  Not to mention the range is pretty good for pulling.  Just a wish really, but it would add at least one more thing to the enjoyment of the class as well as satisfy an urge for Wizards to output more damage.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I too joined the bandwagon. After playing a wizard for 6 hours a night 30 hours on weekends since day one of EQ I have shelved him. Nowadays you'll find me on my cleric or enchanter. Why? because I don't have to ask for groups, I get begged to group. I actually get complimented on my spells because it has a visual effect, they can see Im healing the tank or charming or mezing them. After all these months there still is no way for anyone else to see just how much damage you are doing. What is the point of playing a wizard? Since I have two accounts my wizard is now my taxi, I gate my characters everywhere to where I need to go. But if I had known they were going to be this useless, I would have played a druid first for the gates. They can track those rare mobs to boot and power level my other characters with dmg shields and regens and heals. Why did I even play a wizard? *smacks* head. You want me to join the bandwagon? Just look at how many wizards are actually playing compaired to the other classes at 50+ You will see the numbers are getting less and less each day.<BR>Maybe I should go quad kite stuff ... oh wait, gonna nerf that... that might make us "Unbalanced".<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

It's obvious that we are all so upset about our lack of effectiveness and our obscene incompetence that we cannot offer suggestions to you that you will take seriously.<P>Why not ask OTHER classes why they don't want us in groups?<P>OR<P>Why not play a wizard to level 60 yourself and see first hand!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Another thing about wizards that is VERY unbalanced and rather upsetting....<P>No loot in the Plane of Hate?!! <P>Clerics get UBER loot in the Plane of Hate as well as Fear, pretty much EVERY class BUT wizards get loot in Hate AND Fear, the ONLY mobs that drop wiz loot is the frightfingers in Plane of Fear.  Frightfingers are very few and far between and they rarely drop the carmine armor...leaving wizards with the shaft.<P>If a Wizard is required to gate people to Hate, why dont you put some loot for wizards in the plane?  It isnt fair that all classes but wizards get loot in Hate.  Giving every other class Hate loot but not wizards isnt balanced at all and should be changed.<P>When my guild goes to Hate, my role as a wizard is reduced to Taxi.  I don't get loot there, so I don't even want to go.  All the high level clerics in my guild are decked out in full purple after a few trips to Hate, I have spents days in the planes and have on measely carmine trinket to show for it.

</FONT><HR>and no matter how you slice it, we will have to do more damage to push us back into line with all the other classes in the game.<P>Doesn't matter HOW you do it, but it needs to be done.<P>Maybe a flaming sword of Xuzl that is immune to riposte attacks.  The riposte auto-snuff is the big complaint i see about the sword, other that the fact it can't do damage.<P>Wizards don't really want a pet though.  And this is already the realm of Mages and Necros.<P>Maybe better damage shields that stack with other shields of other classes.  Course, wizards don't want Damage shields, and this is already the bailiwick of Mages and Druids.<P>I don't know, we're supposed to be good at nuking things...  Maybe our nukes could do more damage/less mana?  The whole balance thing boils down to not doing enough damage to keep up with tanks.<P>We can't even KEEP UP with tanks, let alone do the artillery job we are supposed to be doing.  I hear alot of wizards say that they will just be happy to KEEP UP with the tanks at this point.<P>Also, a minor point here.  Can you give one more class the ability to do a PB AE stun?  I don't care if it us or necros or someone else, as it is now we NEED an enc to use our area effect spells.  And enchanters are usually too busy grouping with everyone, since you need an enchanter to do anything cool in this game.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I play a level 54 Wizard on The Rathe.<P>Currently I feel the wizard is in need of these changes:<P>--Damange per manapool ratio needs to be increased by some means.  This can either be done by making spells more efficient (not necessarily high damage) or by drasticly increasing the wizard's current mana pool.  <P>For example: a level 55 spell that does 400pts of damage for 50mana.  <P>Note:  Wizards should not have to depend on other wizards being present to become a viable damage dealer.  AE is not efficient or safe when there is only one wizard- especially at high levels.  <P>Currently I group and I snare with occasionally doing a small bit of damage to a mob here and there.  I serve as an evac.  Wizards still may be the 'masters' of magical damage.  But magical damage is become impotent.  When ice comet, which takes 1/5 of your mana bar barely dents 10% of a single blue standard mob's damage-  there just isn't any power in magic anymore.<P>Wizards need to be able to do more damage, more often, to a lesser % cost of their mana pool.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have been playing this game as a wizard for a very long time. The fundamental problems with wizards are our mana regeneration and/or our 50+ dd spells. <P> Look at the wizard spells before level 51, from 39 to 44 then to 49, our damage increased dramatically, then look at the wizard spells from 51 to 59 and even 60. Now look at the hitpoints and damage monsters do, before kurnak and after, including velious. Can you honestly not see the problem? Wizards need to have their mana regeneration increased so we can blast more to compensate for our lack of increase(AT ALL) from 51 to 59 spells. Or change our draught line of dd, to increase in damage. lev 53 draught should do more damage than lev 51 draught, and 55 more than 53 so on.  This is the main problem with wizard class. <P>More reasons:<BR>1)Other pure casters have pets that do huge amount of damage, they compensate for downtime and medding. Enchanter's pet is weak and not used often, but they have unique abilities and is the most wanted class.  Wizards do not have pets, our only line of offense is dd, which equals mana.<P>2)Mage's dd and necro's dot are only slightly less effective than wizard's dd. <P>3)We cannot keep up with our group at high levels. Mage has the powerful pet doing damage and blast here and there. Necro has good mana regeneration, also pet and dots. Wizards have dd, but with the huge amount of hp lev50+ monsters have our dd cannot do the percent damage to monster it suppose to like pre kunark.  <P>I am very happy at wizards before kurnak came out, our ice comet gave us the title master of damage, and wizards were balanced as verant intended. However after kurnak came out and now velious, our dd never increased as it should. Instead we got a faster casting dd with a better efficiency but low damage. And even sadder, the dd itself never increased in damage except at 57,  which it increased by 40 or so points of damage. This is really a joke to a wizard. I almost laughed after waiting for 7 levels of hell for the upgrade dd to find out it does 40+ more damage. <P><BR>Gagaliya Ba'La'Boom!<BR>Gnome evoker of bristlebane<BR>The Claw of Nagafen<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;- more damage... we are talking balance here <BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;can't believe you are asking for this<P>"<BR>OMG---read the entire 12 pages on this on the first thread and then the 3 on here. We are talking BALANCE here too. I can't believe you don't think its called for. "more damage" is not what you think it is. We are currently doing less damage than warriors, monks, rogues, necros, magicians, rangers, shamans, and possibly bards in 98% of the game. 1% on raids in Kunark where we rock, and 1% being raids in Velious where we are doing nothing in terms of damage along with necros and mages. (side note make post called "casters unit against SoV--enchanters excluded")<BR>"<P><BR>More damage is EXACTLY what I think it is. Verant won't up our damage bro, they want other casting classes to do the same at the end game.  Only reason war/rogue/monk does more damage is because they get a heal.  You can't compare melee to caster damage output, of COURSE they will outdamage you with a healer in the group they will out damage EVERY caster (over time) they have NO MANA.  Ask a melee about soloing see if you don't get a dirty look; Without a healer they can't do enough damage fast enough to survive.  You can't have your cake and eat it too.<P>Yes, we SHOULD have done more damage than other casters, but we won't.  Any request for better damage, higher efficiency, or faster mana regen will fall on deaf ears.  But you go ahead and join the other 12 pages of wizards requesting this pipe dream.<P>Since we clearly can't have the damage output pumped up, the only thing left that will balance a wizard with other classes is to add group friendly spells or utility spells.  Highly unlikely Verant will let wizards have any spells other than damage spells, but that's really all thats left to ask for.<P>Expect no changes to the wizard, go quad kite, or twink a monk if you want group play.  Or just delete your hopelessly unbalanced wiz.  Personally I'm gonna go out and kill a druid, always makes me feel better.<P>Vabann Loosecannon <BR>45 Wiz<BR>Vallon Zek<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Other casters have decent nukes still, with pets/dots/fireshields etc etc.  Hmm how much of a DMG margin do wizards have after all? <P>Ok but after being LESS balanced and being handicapped for 49 LVL's surely the Wiz will now CLAIM his class description, for now he is an experienced wizard. <P>BUT wait, Lvl's 50 - 60.  Whats the point?  Too bad Velious came out, because Absor - I don't know why anyone would keep playing one post 50 (unless the wizard wants to stay away from the new game content).<P><BR>This is why they aren't wanted in groups.  Because. What the hell do they do?  What? What is their class specialality?  <P>Absor, <P>Wizards must excel in DMG dealing, they must do it fast and they must be able to do a MATERIAL amount of dmg to whatever they fight.  If wizards cannot be incredible in offense why why why do they exist?  Wizards must have incredible porting ability.  <P>We all picked classes to be the best at certain things.  <P>Warriors want to be the best tank. <P>Clerics want to be the best healers. <P>Enchanters want to be the best crowd controllers.<P>Rogues want to be a HIGH melee dmg class in the right scenario.<P>Do you get what im saying?  We all pick classes because we want to excel at something.<P><BR>Now if I compare each wiz port to a druid port you'll call it class envy, but the bottom line is that ports were a point of focus to the wizard class and NOT the druid class in the descriptions. Why make each port inferior to the druid equivalent?  <P>See this in itself is not a catalyst for the wizard class being un-balanced.  It is rather a MICROCOSM of WHY THE WIZARD CLASS IS UNBALANCED.  That no attention by Verant is being paid to PRESERVE CLASS FOCUS.  Class's (unfortunately. I really feel for all classes that have this problem) suffer from a lot of blurring in different areas.  I strongly feel (as do many here) that the wizard class has a bad case of this blur problem.<P>The classes that have VERY LITTLE BLURRING if at all are:<P>Clerics<BR>Enchanters<BR>Warriors<BR>Rogues<P>These classes work very very well right now in the way things are done in Everquest, VERY well.  <BR>You know why they work well? Each class specializes in something AND THEY ARE THE BEST AT THAT THING. Therefor they compliment each other AMAZINGLY.<P>Can you please please please make a miracle happen and see that the wizard class has changes (and im sorry to say they aren't as minor as you want. This class is broken bad.) made to it so that you can add it to that list of classes i just mentioned abobe? Make the wizard class a class that ALSO stands on its own.

</FONT><HR>Absor and many others:<P>I have noticed many say they don't understand why Wizards keep asking for more damage and then go on to suggest that we buff or do damage shields or stun or snare, or whatever. Here is my rebuttel for those people and something for Absor to think about...<P>BUFFS<BR>===========<BR>Why do Wizards want to buff? Seriously! Maybe b/c they feel there is very little else we can provide to the group. Our damage abilities sure aren't the reason. Many Druids, Clerics, Shamans, Necros, and even some Mages complain that they become a "support" class later in life.<P>Personally when I clicked that create Wizard button I had hopes of being wanted b/c as a Wizard I can deal out the damage. I don't wanna compete (it IS competition out there!) for role of group buffer. Sorry. You would have to be very creative on the buff.<P>Something like this MIGHT work...<P>Group Focus spell - makes everyone in group perform 10% better.<P>That would be pretty darn hard to program w/ the way EQ works ...ouch! That is some serious coding. No buffing for us than.<P><BR>DAMAGE SHIELDS<BR>====================<BR>Mages do this already. Why tread on them? This is one of the two things they can provide on a high magic resistent mob. Than they also provide a pet. Now if u were a group who would you take?<P><BR>SINGLE SNARE<BR>================<BR>Sure I'd love this, but this makes Rangers and Druids happy knowing their snare is more effective than ours. Doing this approaches their territory.<P><BR>That leaves Damage and Ports. I really do NOT know a quick fix to this problem. I submitted some *ideas* on page 7 of Part I of this topic.<P>For the % damage spells to work, it has to be a % damage of REMAINING HPs. Not of the total HPs. That *would* be over-powering. So as the mob gets lower on HP the value that spell provides is lessened.<P>Yeah, w/ this spell groups would WANT a wizard there to provide this service. That is what wizards want, to be wanted w/o having to compete in buff/crowd control land. We want to be wanted for our damage capabilities w/ the mana we have. To speed up the battle.<P>Aggro is biggest problem. Might have to make there be no aggro factor but *other* penalties.<P>The way it is right now tho. You blast all your mana ...say no resists at all... and do no noticeable amount of damage. You med, boom you are summoned or just plain taken out b/c sitting/medding is a taunt too. What kinda service is that? I am talking about...<P>High Magic Resistant Mobs, and<BR>High Hit Point Mobs<P>The more those two increase the less effective we become. The first one is obvious, but after playing so many D&D based games you would think the 2nd one would not be.<P>Like I said, I do not have the quick fix so as not to over power us is Solo Land ...but as it stands right now... I and many Wizards feel soloing is the best course of action.<P>Double edged sword. More like Triple edged but anyways.<P><BR>Either way, we are not balanced. Before Kunark came I had a very different perspective and felt we were ...course I was only level 25 at the time or so ...so I didn't know what the higher levels were like. Now w/ so much Uber gear out there ...no way. Melee classes are only limited by the weapons they choose.<P>Casters in general have very little to choose from. Our damage is very much limiting. Just 'bout every caster feels this way the higher the level they get.<P><BR>PORTS<BR>==============<BR>Sorry but even w/ these I still waste a lot of time traveling. I don't consider this a fair trade off for doing sub-par damage.<P>I love TPs. If my Paladin had TPs, I would stop playing my Wizard altogether.<P>Still doesn't balance us out. No way. I play my Paladin more these days ...especially since the XP penalty was lifted (THANK YOU, that truely was god send and the right thing to do ...prolly kept more gamers w/ that decision).<P><BR>Thank you for your time and patience. Take many a Advil for the eyestrain.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Please help us, even if our ideas suck. Think of something pratically and useful than. We *do need* help in the Class Balance dept.<P><BR>=========================<BR>IN A NUTSHELL<BR>=========================<P><BR>Others mentioned bugs/fixes. That would be nice too. But if you really want to keep SOME people playing wizards...<P><BR>Find a way to balance us out ...to be wanted ...and to want to group.<P><BR>Most respectively,<BR>Shenlung<BR>Level 35 Wizard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>How bout giving us a super hard quest + research spell for Gate: Timorous that would land you in the firepot room.  This would solve most complaints about wizzie teleportations.  Make it self only, so no quick group travel, and maybe even require a component.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Here are my thoughts on the balance status of Wizards:<P>Keep in mind I play a level 58 Wizard and have played almost every other class up to higher levels as well.<P>Things that right:<P>Soloing:  I have been able to solo by kiting up until 58 even though it is very inefficient to do so.<P>Major raids:  Due to the existence of the lure line of spells wizards are wanted on major raids.<P>Pre level 40:  Wizards don't have much of a problem getting into a group in level less than 40.<P>Things that are wrong:<P>Getting into a group post Level 50:<P>It is still very hard for a wizard to get a group for just normal ep hunting.  The only way I have been able to get a group is if I am attached to an Enchanter or Cleric.  <P>Why is this?  There are several reasons:<P>1.  Wizards are not the masters of damage post 50:  <P>Warriors, Monks, Rangers and Rogues with good weapons can do as much damage as wizards per sec as wizards can.  But a wizard can only do it as long as they have manna.  The argument has been in the past that these classes expend HP as they do their damage so that is balanced.  This is only partially true.  Only the main tank takes damage as they dish it out.  Tanks have not always been able to dish out damage as fast as wizards..   This really started after the really powerful weapons were added with the release of Kunark and the release of the epic weapons.  As over time powerful weapons more available the problem will get worse.<P>2.  Wizards are not able to do a large enough % of the mobs HP very quickly post 50:  <P>The amount of HP of monsters has increased drastically at post 50.  This has had the effect that wizards nukes do a smaller % of the total HP of the monster.  Even the 49th level yard trash has more hit points than a 60th level wizard can do with all her manna.  This means that wizard's traditional roll of emergency take down person in a group has been eliminated at these levels.<P>3. At post level 50 wizards are no longer able to effectively do auxiliary crowd control:<P>Not only do monsters break root a lot when a wizard is trying to crowd control them but monsters higher than level 51 summon so rooting the mob away from combat does not work as a method of crowd control.<P>Ok, here are my proposed solutions to the problem.  One or all of these could be implemented to a greater or lesser degree to alleviate the problem:<P>1.  Increase the speed in which wizards get back manna.  This can be done in several ways:<P>Increase the effectiveness of Harvest at post 50.  It only gives 1/2 of a bubble back to a wizard with 200 int and no manna jewelry.  With manna jewelry it can give back much less.  Make it give back a % of total Manna or double or triple the amount it gives back.<P>Ad another higher level Harvest that takes a component like a peridot and gives back a lot more manna.  Make it renew every 10 min and give back 1000 manna or renew every 5 min and give back 500 manna.  Remember that each one of these spells permanently takes up one of the 8 spell jewels and that creates a major trade off to memorizing these spells.  Level 55 is a good level for the higher level spell.<P>Increase the effectiveness of manna skin so that it gives back 4 manna a tick instead of 1.<P>Increase the cap on meditate.  It hurts wizards more than most other classes that after level 53 meditation does not give manna back any faster.<P>All or just one of the above methods could be used to a greater or lesser degree to give wizards back manna faster.<P>2.  Make wizard able to better help Enchanters with crowd control.  Post 50 only bards can help enchanters with crowd control very effectively.  Here is a way to do that.<P>Give wizards the ability to do single target mesmerize.  At level 39 give wizards the level 4 spell Enthrall.  At level 55 give wizards the level 34 spell Entrance.<P>Enchanters would still be the only ones to have the more effective single target and AOE crowd control spells.  The effect of this would be that not only would enchanters die less often wizards would be much more desirable in a group for auxiliary crowd control.<P>3.  The last way to increase the effectiveness of wizards in a group would be to increase the amount of damage they can do per second.  This can be done several ways:<P>Allow wizard spells to have critical hits.  Give wizard nukes a % change to do double or triple the max spell damage to mobs.  This has been brought up before but shot down due to the increased agro factor.  As a 58th level wizard I do such a small fraction of the damage to a monster in a battle this is not really a problem.  I just wait until the mob is at half health and nuke until it is dead..  If the spell did a critical and did more damage I would just nuke less and use less manna.<P>Decrease the time to cast, recovery time, and manna cost of wizards nukes so that they can again out damage tanks in a combat. <P>Like tanks have better weapons, and mages and necros have focuses for summoning, add items to the game that reduce the manna cost for wizards casting nukes.  Have one for fire, ice, and magic.<P>Well that is all of my suggestions..  A lot of things to consider..<P>Personally I like method 2 the most since it does not increase the power of wizards but makes them more wanted in groups.<P>I also think there should be more teleports in Kunark and the "kunark dungeon only" should be removed from the existing ones or teleport to caster's bind point should be added.. but as Absor has stated teleports are not really a wizard issue.<P>Thanx,<BR>-Myst<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm an occasional player, low level and not<BR>as intimately familiar with the game as some<BR>people posting here, so take my comments for<BR>what they're worth...<P>I can live with the ports we have but in truth...<BR>that was a bit of a shock, when I found that<BR>druids could port (the book says nothing about<BR>that at all!) and that our ports were fewer and<BR>more poorly located. If this is being left alone,<BR>please modify the wording of the wizard class<BR>description.<P>AEs, are what turned me onto wizards. And alas,<BR>for most of a wizard's life, only one of the<BR>four lines of AEs work properly...<P>* Al'Kabor spells are just wrong. A completely<BR>  pointless line of spells.<P>* Rains are broken (number of waves and hitting<BR>  pets) and that makes another line of AEs next<BR>  to useless.<P>* Almost every PBAE at lower levels does too<BR>  little damage to be useful for the mana.<P>* Columns are the best of a bad lot and they too<BR>  are low enough damage at lower levels that<BR>  their use is very specialized...<P>Other things:<P>* Weakness at low levels; well, the book warned<BR>  me that wizards take time to mature... every<BR>  MUD I've played, wizards are wimps till they<BR>  get high up... it's a price to pay and one I'm<BR>  willing to pay... but waiting till the 40s for<BR>  the maturation of my character is a bit much.<BR>  The whole mid 30s thing of being weaker than<BR>  other damage casters is amazing... and very<BR>  disheartening.<P>* Everything I hear about Velious is depressing<BR>  in the extreme. Sounds like I'll have to make<BR>  another character to play there at all, and<BR>  given how much time I have to play this game,<BR>  it is unlikely I'll do that.<P>* Broken Lures are disturbing; without those<BR>  spells, even Kunark is going to be impossible<BR>  to play.<P>My suggestions:<P>+ Fix or remove the Al'Kabor spells. Removing<BR>  them even would do nothing to any wizard,<BR>  since none use them.<P>+ Fix rains, if nothing else... fix rains!<P>+ Take another look at the damage on the other<BR>  AEs, at lower levels.<P>+ Up the damage on our DDs in the mid level so<BR>  that wizards can be seen to mature into their<BR>  real power. They should not be out-damaged<BR>  by other casters at any time.<P>+ I love the whole idea of lures and draughts.<BR>  Add lures and draughts for levels under 50.<P>How to fix the Velious situation is beyond me...<BR>I find it a little surprising that Verant didn't<BR>foresee that damage casters would be shafted<BR>with the expansion... it is up to you guys to<BR>fix somehow. Making an entire continent<BR>unusable by a number of classes is a bit much.<P>Overall, I'm kinda happy with the wizard. Course<BR>I'm not far enough along to have seen a number<BR>of the things being complained about... but still<BR>and all, when a group I was in, back at level 16<BR>was stunned into awe with just a full mana burn<BR>with Shock of Lightning on an overpull... heck<BR>none of them would've said a word about me sitting<BR>through the next three pulls. =)  And that, to me,<BR>is what this class is about.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Greetings  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>The most is said above, i have not read all the posts, so my 2 cents may be reposts.<P>- With Velious our DD Output must be increased. Maybe with a %-based Spell.<P>- I still want you to give us Wizards a CotH spell ( mages ), cause we and the drooods are the master of teleporting, and in my eyes its not a summoning spell ( if it is, why dont you give it to necros, or the summon corpse to mages ? ), it is a personal "reverse" teleport.<P>- Increase Mana-Regeneration per tick for ManaSkin<P>- As the masters of damage, i think it will be fine, if you give us a skill to cast a spell without using mana. My idea is : Starting with Lvl 20 with a damage ratio of 5 = 100DD. Lvl 60 = 300DD. Reuse in 1 Minute or so.<P>- The casting time of our spells needs to be adjusted. Lets do a cap limit for dd spells of 5 secs.<P>Im very pleased with my wizard, i do not want pets, or healings, or sow or anything else.

</FONT><HR>Hmmm it seems that a new wizard description is needed for the manual. That and the druid, to conclude that they are the "masters of travel".  Really really wierd, imho druids are never the masters of travel in ANY other genre of fantasy I have encountered. But Absor said it is so, so it is.<P>New Wizard description?<P>Wizards seek out knowledge, but have less quests and class specific items than anyother quests. This is why they are always seeking knowledge and never finding it. They are the second best teleporters of all the two classes that teleport in Norrath! Although, sometimes they teleport you to places where you will be dead before you arrive. When it comes to offensive magic, wizards are pretty average! But they are selfish, and can provide nothing to others and even less when out of mana.<P>/smirk<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

It would seem to me (note that I am a Dark Elf wizard) only to make sense that the South Ro gate should also have self-only and possibly group variants.<P>Especially considering the Cazic Gate is so dangerous. A self-gate for South Ro makes for easier access to Grobb especially, as well as other important evil vendors.<P>This is also an issue that affects a large portion of an evil Wizard's life, which may be missed by the many posters who may have already managed to get the South Ro gate or can survive the Cazic gate.<P>Also, a thanks to Absor for undertaking this discussion.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I've seen alot of suggestions, alot deal with more damage, bigger spells.  Personally I don't think bigger spells is the key.  They just get the mob ticked off at you faster, so you end up casting later.  A self defeating purpose.  And this is where the real problem with wizards come in.  We can easily, on a single mob, do more damage than anyone else.  Result: dead wizard.  We are forced to hold back and let ourselves be outdamaged for several reasons.  The first reason is the taunt, do more damage than the tanks and suddenly you have a quad hitting mob doing 200pts a blow beating on you until the tanks can taunt it off.  When you only have 1000 hit points, you won't last long.  The second reason is down time.  Burn faster and suddenly you are useless to the group, so you must conserve mana and therefore contribute less to a group.  The only time I find I am wanted around is for raids because our big nukes help the party to get experience.  Heck, I have gotten solo experience on fear because of my big nukes.  Personally what I would like to see is more fast cast, low cost, mid damage, high efficiency spells.  Drought spells are sweet, but a 3 to 1 efficiency against the big mobs just doesn't cut it when you factor in resists.  It is not uncommon to be resisted multiple times in a series of casts, dropping your efficiency down to less than 1 to 1.  215 pts of mana, 17 damage.  215 mana, 0 damage.  215 mana 148 damage.  And the big nukes are even worse, 400 mana for 8 pts of damage with Ice Comet is just plain painful.  Even speed wise we are out cast by other classes, mages for instance get a 2 second cast time on a spell.  Our damage is not significantly higher on a cast/time basis than many other classes, our efficiency is not significantly higher than other classes and yet we give up alot of other powerful abilities but get nothing in the areas where we should be masters.  I think alot of the post 50 spells tried to address this very problem, unfortunately the mobs get tougher so much faster that it just can't keep up.  I feel that what the class needs is better mana efficiency in it's spells, less resists (although resists become less of a problem if efficiency increases dramatically), and shorter cast times.<P>Draught and Lure lines were a very nice addition to the game, but they come a bit late to help the wizard through the difficult to group mid levels.  I would like to see the lines extended down into lower levels.  Lure might not be as efficient on a  glance of cast per cast.  315 mana vs 215 mana for essentially the same damage, but at least with lure I know it will hit and over time taking into account resists will be just as efficient mana wise.  But Draught allows more casts in a given time frame so you will do more damage, assuming no resists, in the long run.  Tough choice here.  Frankly I don't see why we need all the different lines, just give us a 2 second cast lure spell with a draught line mana cost.  Now a wizard can do some serious damage spread out over time without resist, resist, resist.<P>Flaming Sword is a spell that has some awesome implications against those big mobs.  A spell that can do literally unlimited damage if you assume it never gets hit with damage, which it will.  But resists are no longer important.  Not to mention we don't get it until level 59.  I would like to see it turned into a line of spells, extended downward so lower level casters can use a less damaging version of the spell.  Big problem is also the cost.  700 mana is a bit of a high cost for a one target "pet" that isn't a pet.<P>Lastly I think this rather falls into a wish list category.  Astral travel.  Talk about the ultimate in information gathering.  You leave your body behind and go wandering the zone in ghost form.  You float, can move through doors, etc.  But you can't pick anything up, or attack anything and all the mobs view you as indifferent.  The only thing it is good for is exploring and scouting.  Not to mention it fits in well with the whole seekers of knowledge aspect described as part of the wizard's role.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi Absor.<P>This thread is meant to be about class balance, and from reading your answers on castersrealm I saw that not many of the issues there stuck to that. So I will try to address mostly balance issues.<P>I've played my wizard for over 18 months now and have 80+ days played time on him. I have achieved level 59 now and I think I have a pretty good idea about how it is to play a wizard.<P>First of all, I love playing my wizard. Even before I bought the game myself and was only watching my friends play it I couldn't see myself playing another char. (Atleast not as main).<P>I have never felt that there was any issues about the wizard class that was so bad that it was a class people should avoid playing. I love the fact that I can "go for it" and try to kill any mob lvl 1-50, knowing I will have a decent chance of success (higher mobs summon you). The downside in this is ofcourse that it takes 10+ minutes to med up my estimated 3000 mana after the fight. But since I have a big guild and lots of friends in the game I spend a lot of time chatting with them which makes my downtime funnier =). And since I play EQ quite too much often I just love my new "Improved Invisibility"-spell, which has made it possible for me to sit and meditate safely for 10 minutes while I can go make a sandwich or something since EQ seriously is bad for my eating habits.<P>Balancing issues, yes, let me first adress our spell lines. I use about 15 spells I would guess on a regular basis. We can start with my personal buffs. The biggest complaint I have here is the time the buffs last. Resistant skin for example gives me 15 PR/DR, it's a lvl 12 spell and I get none better at levels beyond 12. I would love to see this spells lasting time increase greatly due to what level you are. Or it being replaced at a higher level with a spell that lasted longer. Of course I would like an increase in the PR/DR but I understand that wizards aren't supposed to have that. What annoys me alot though is that I have to recast this spell so damn often. I wouldn't mind if the new spell cost more mana and gave the same resists, as long if I didnt have to recast it every 10 minutes. It's so annoying. The same goes for my other buffs but it's not nearly as bad as with resistant skin. Furthermore I think Resistant skin should stack with Resist Poison since you just made a change that made Elemental Armor stack with Resist Fire.<P>The other spells I use are : <P>Draught series (quick casting DDs), theese are great.<P>Lure series (hardly resistable DDs), theese are very good, but they don't work as a Verant programmer stated that there were always one base MR/CR/HR that had 0% resists. And if the target is a boss mob with high resists and don't have Tashan/Malo on him even lures will get resisted 90% of the time.<P>AE Snare, 51 snare is great, the 29 snare I found very small use in. It's though RIDICULUS that I at lvl 59 can fizzle 7-8 times in a row before getting the 51 snare off. Same goes for Abscond that is alteration based too and normally takes 2 fizzles before working.<P>Root series, well, I started using the lvl 4 root at lvl 4, and at lvl 59 I still use that root. I haven't tested using the lvl 58 Fetter spell much, but actually I just went over the spell data and since it has lower casting time than Root at the price of 150% more mana used I think I will give this spell another try to see if it's worth the use. I doubt it though, since I normally use root when I'm running from a mob out of mana, and when running it takes a lot longer time to get that 30 mana to root the mob than it takes to get 75 mana.<P>Gates, old world gates are good except for the West Karanas gate that was due to a zone design mistake. The Kunark gates/portals were extremely bad, and should be looked into, changing the fact that Markars/Tishans relocation only can be cast in Kunark dungeons to that they can be cast anywhere would satisfy me. The new Velious port system is looking good.<P>Stuns, got to love my new 56 stun. The 54 AE stun Thunderbold has no real use though. 51 stun isn't bad either. Removing the increased save throw on stuns was a great move.<P>Harvest, saved my life many times.<P>Concussion, still don't have it, but I could finish it anytime if I took the time, I should do this, cause that's a GREAT wizard spell. (Bit depending on how much it gets resisted though).<P>Pillar of Frost/Lightning/Flame, great spells, quadkiting is fun, but very dangerous. The only reason I've been doing this successfully is because I have what it takes -&gt; a RL friend that is a level 60 cleric to res me when I die (mostly due to linkdeath). Wizards are in my mind the most vulnerable class when going linkdead.<P>Al Kabor series, totally useless spells, I wouldn't care for a second if whole line was removed even if it was not replaced. The ideal scenario for using this spell must be having 4-5 mobs with 5-600 hps standing close but not very close to each other, where one stands in the middle so you will hit them all, and they will all die on cast. Since if they have more hps than that they will just all come after you and then it's much more efficient to use the Pillar series. Even if I got this perfect scenario I wouldn't bother memming this spell, I would just aggro them all then use my point blank AEs to take them down.<P>Jyll series (PB AE), has a use and goes under risk/reward.<P>Ok I admit that was a lot of talk and not that much about class balance, so I will adress that more now. <P>Before Kunark came out the wizard class was balanced. We were the masters of direct damage as we were supposed to be. With Kunark and lure spells the wizards became a great addition to big raids like killing Trakanon, Venril Sathir and such. With Kunark and draught spells the wizard defended his position in a group having mana efficient spells. However from beeing used to be in the "exp group" on multigroup raids, you would have to realize that highlevel tanks now outdamage you since mobs have alot of hps and even if you nuked away without caring about aggro you couldn't outdamage a tank heavy group anymore.<P>At the moment wizards are in a very funny situation. We are the most valuable class on any old world/kunark boss mob that can only have 32k hps. But at the same time we are the least valuable class on the Velious boss mobs with 200-1000k hps. I've seen reports of a rogue doing 230.000 dmg on ONE mob (thifling focuser) in PoG. While a wizard wouldn't come close to that damage. Wizards are the offensive class that had lost most on the launch of velious boss mobs. There is no good use for a wizard against thoose mobs anymore, and if the new Velious dungeon mobs has more hps than old world/kunark mobs has, that means that wizards dont justify their position in a group anymore, and that it's more of a burdon than use to have a wizard in your group.<P>Finding a group can be hard for all classes, and if I judge my own experiences in sebilis it's quite hard for a wizard to find a group at the moment. A sebilis group NEEDS a cleric, and it NEEDS an enchanter, and it WANTS a shaman, and it PREFERS a warrior, but paladin/ranger will do, and you might want a rogue for secondary tank. Wizards then have to compete with the last 1-2 spots in a group with necros/mages/druids/bards etc. and many of theese classes have spells that benefit more to the group than wizards.<P>It has not come to the point where people don't want wizards in their groups though, but with the way Verant is developing new worlds and changing the rules, time is talking AGAINST wizards. From beeing a very powerful class, we are becoming nobodys.<P>Just my 5 cents...<P>Leews Kinslayer<BR>Level 59 wizard<BR>Cazic-Thule server<BR>Expatriate Loreweavers<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi, I love my wizard in fact i took hoildays just to lvl him though lvl54, But there are a few big problems that realy need to be fixed. <P>1 i spent 60$ on the Vels addon (i live in australia ) only to find, as a class iam useless against these mob, a magi pet alone will out dmg me this HAS to be fixed, please! a % based DD would solve this problem far more then anything else i can think of. <P>1a A %dd wont be used on low hps mob, why? waste of mana (low hps = 20k or less)<BR>2a A % based dd like lures would cost alot about 1kmana. <BR>3a Giveing a % dd wont increase our soloing ablities.<P>2 I dont want a pet, i dont want clarity, I do want to be master of damge not overpowered by a shami or doting druid, This is a class issue that has been around since the new lvls where added, and is highlighted by your insane increase of hps of uber mob. Wizards arent upto the job and as a share holder of sony and a custmoer of EQ i demand these issues get some more open minded thought rather then iam not wanting to use a % based spell. If everquest cant change and grow what hope has it. I belive u are the only one to answer for the problems with wizards by makeing huge changes to the hps of mob and the fact u need to be in a uber guild to kill them. <P>All the other issues i can only see as secondry to what our class is ment to do Damge. More ports would be good so theres less runing around time, Havest is a joke. Our see line of spells are  a waste of book space as is dmg shield line of spells. Our AEs need a little work. Fizzle fizz fizz yep u known what iam talking about hehe our snare line. And Manaskin please look at this spell  costs is to much for 1 tick of mana.<P>If ive sounded upset and sharp with is post it is becasue iam upset. And something needs to be done.<BR>I must say that some of the new spells that where added are great and the root/snare thing rocks, but lets get back to thte main issue damge and or the lack of it wizards are able to do in a group postion, and against uber mob.<P>Fabair lvl55 wizard Broxt<P>ps sorry its so long. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I see 1 main issues that casue the wizard class to be "unblanced" <P>being a "pure" class (warriors) (clerics) (wizards). .we get no SIGNIFICANT advantage over other caster classes. <P>warrior= best tanks =TRUE<BR>cleric= bet healer=TRUE<BR>wiz=best caster/damage dealer= NOT TRUE<P>we give up the luxuries of a pet(NO we dont want a pet) or othere ways to inflict damage/be involved in a fight without constantly expending mana (pets/damage shield)for  being the PURE caster class. but we don't get any significant advanatge. our specialty is DD and we should be far and above the BEST/FASTEST/NASTIEST DD casters out there by a long margin which we are not.<P>IMHO that should mean that we should when full mana be the BADDEST MOFO casting the HARDEST/FASTEST Nukes and doing obscene amoounts of damage (which pet classes/tanks/etc can easily outdamage the "masters of damage*cough*" that we arecurrently). When taht mana is gone we are "spent" vulnerable/useless untill we can med to full again (which would be fine if we were what verant claimed "masters of magical damage")but since we are not ....we are liek that kid with bad asthma on the basketball team that cna play for about 4 plays loosk good scores a few points then sits out for 3 quartesr while the team carries him.......<P>That said since i doubt you guys will improve our nukes or give us expensive nukes that do 2-5% total HP damage on a mob. i have an alternate suggestion (if you want to buff our nukes instead PLEASE by all means do).  What i would suggest is that we get one or more of the following <BR>(a) an upgrade to harvest at lvl 50<BR>(b) warrriors can get higher 2hs/1hs/dodge etc skills tahn any other tanks (pure melee) have the same for wizards (pure caster)in channleling/meditate/specialize  (this will at least allow us to use our current spells more thus providing somewhat what i suggested above)<P>either/both of these fixes (i would prefer both or option b) will give wizards more longevity/participation in the big fights/super hp mobs that u put us up aginst in velious..<P>history of the wizard<BR>apr 99 ...<BR>they ks too much nerf em <BR>kunark ....<BR>wizards have been *****ing give em some low resist spells (actually useful)<BR>velious....<BR>we gave out too much good tank stuf lets make those mobs have 124237635765327 HP .. to bad that wizards nukes wont even move mob hp a pixel<P>NeuroS <BR>lvl 52 Wiz <BR>TDE<BR>7th Hammer <P><BR>   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It just look like a newbie spell right now and i m very disapointed of this.<P>Maybe you could use the effect of the 'frost bolt' level 1 or 4 wizard spell with a funny blue COMET  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">)<P>I'm 45 with my wiz and everytime i go in a guild raid i load this frost bolt and launch my hotkey:<P>: begins to cast Ice Comet<BR>/cast 3<BR>: the %T is devasted with a massive icy comet !<P>Make every one laugh but at least i m the only wizy to have A REAL COMET landing at mob  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P><BR>Finally please make a clear statement about the Al'Kabor line of spell. My personal idea is that this line of spell is designed for NPC to deal lot of damage to those camping PC !<P>Hashar<BR>Retired Wizard<BR>Hope to play again soon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As far as I'm concerned this class is broken from 1-60.  It's that bad.  We've been screaming about it for over a year now and it's just all gone right over Verant's head.<P>Just remove the following wizard spell lines:<P>ALL magnification spells.  They are useless.<P>ALL fade/yonder/shadowstep spells.  They are useless(cept maybe in PVP)<P>ALL Alakabor spells.  They are terrible mana hogs.  I have NEVER seen a wizard use them.  Useless.<P>Cazic gate.  Useless.<P>Evacuate Skyfire.  Useless.<P>West Karana gate/portal/evac.  Useless.<P>ALL rain spells.  IF they don't hit a pet at least one wave will most likely be resisted.  Useless.<P>Now what does that leave us with?  Regular DD(our most-used spells), Column/PB AE, gates/ports/evacs.<P>Here's the numbers Absor:<BR>Wizard<BR>Level 34 Ice Shock<BR>320 dmg(max after 4 levels), 160 mana, 4.15 seconds to cast<P>Magician<BR>Level 34 Cinder Bolt<BR>336 dmg(max after 4 levels), 175 mana, 5 seconds to cast<P>Ahh, but it's a bolt right?  Nevermind that when that bolt hits, that damage is IMMEDIATE, just like our DD.  But lets look at their other DD.<P>Magician<BR>Level 34 Blaze<BR>296 dmg(max after 4 levels), 155 mana<P>Wizard<BR>Level 34 Ice Shock<BR>320 dmg(max after 4 levels), 160 mana<P>That's comparing DD to DD.  Our spells costs 5 more mana and does a whopping FOURTEEN(14) more points damage.  And it's OK for a mage to also have a pet that hits for over 30 dmg plus has dual wield, bash, stun or root?<P>That's just one example.  It happens at pretty much every spell circle.  Sometimes its a druid or cleric(?????) instead of a mage, but it's pretty consistent.  At pretty much every spell level wizards are neck in neck with another caster that either A)Has a pet or B)Has many more group-friendly spells than we do.<P>I could list every single spell circle but there's no need for it.  If you are really trying to help, if you are really concerned about class balance, go to eq.castersrealm.com and look at the spell lists.  It has all the info you need. <P>Remember, DD is really all wizards are about.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 10 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=050989&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=050989&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
