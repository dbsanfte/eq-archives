I've spent alot of time in EC trading, and have pretty much brought my AC up to way beyond Others for my lvl.    I still do not take the roll of primary tank. which is good! I'm not supposed to take this roll, this is the warriors job. <P>After 40, and Seriously past 50 with the defense cap not being raised, and the serious lack of hp's, The ranger is a "SUICIDE CLASS"  You commented that we need to "learn the lessons that Rogues and Wizards learn early in their careers."  The problem with that statement is we don't have the means to do that.  <P>Rouges have the defensive skill caps of Warriors to help them survive when aggro'd, and evade to shed that aggro.<P>Wizards do damage from afar, and really have to go out of their way to get that mob on them.  Example blasting straight from the get go.  They also have everyone and their mom trying to taunt off of them when aggro'd.<P>Rangers have neither the defense, hp's, and really jolt is to ineffiecent to shed the aggro.  <P>"because you CAN do a ton of damage, doesn't mean you should."  First off we do not do a "ton of damage"  We cannot even be considered for this Monks,Rogues own us, and they should.   What you are saying is basically, DO NOT PLAY YOUR CLASS THE WAY IT IS INTENDED.  /boggle /boggle<P>Ranger=Offensive hybrid, or not?   Problem being, we cannot play as a offensive hybrid past 50.

</FONT><HR>Fandros instead of coming here and posting cursory comments, why don't you meet argument with argument?<P>Rangers don't have a "Bad" name, they are analyzed as a class by the rest of the players as a result of OBSERVATION and GROUP USEFULNESS.<P>No one is saying that Rangers aren't PLAYABLE.  They are.  ALL classes as they stand NOW are PLAYABLE.  It's a question of DESIREABLE and USEFULNESS at the High end game.<P>Now please, we aren't idiots.  If there is a choice in a group for warrior or ranger, the warrior gets picked hands down.  If there was a choice between a rogue and a ranger in a group the rogue gets picked hands down. IT IS SIMPLE MATH. PERIOD.  FIRST in offense, FIRST in defense is BETTER than FOURTH in offense LAST in defense.<P>I don't know how to make this more clearer.<P>Maybe you are fortunate enough to have regular friends to group with.  Maybe you LIMITED yourself to exping in only a FEW spots.  Maybe you don't care about not being an active and valuable participant in major raids. Fine, that is your choice.  But please don't denigrate others.<P>If you are going to post about how wonderful the class is and how wrong others are then give DETAILS of your argument.  Despite the fact that you claim to be 59, I still have more experience with the class than you and will gladly discuss this further.

</FONT><HR>First off, I don't think there should be any complaints about a ranger taking too much damage if they're trying to be the primary tank.  That's just not their job.  I don't have experience with the post 50 game, so I can't comment on that, but I know in the 40's it's really not a problem. I play a warrior and rangers do not have a problem staying alive in my group.  I take almost all of the hits.  Certainly it helps that I'm dual wielding.  If I was using a 2 handed weapon they'd get aggro'ed more.  Most warriors learn by that level that they need to dual wield if taunting is important though.  Monks are harder for me to taunt off of then rangers, but add in my taunt skill and I can keep up with and frequently exceed the monks on the hate list.  The monks are not only hitting more, but often are outdamaging me.  The "taunt" helps offset that. I'd like to see it be a little better though. <P>I think what needs to change is the way aggro works with 1 and 2 handed weapons.  Many little hits increase aggro too much.  I've seen a few people asking for a change here.  Warriors asked for it too.  We want to get aggro'ed more without having to throw out 2 handed weapons.      </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>To make a comment on the damage dealing aspect of Wizards and Rogues.  They do massive amounts of damage in a short period of time.  Wizards are able to do this from far away.  See where I'm going with this?  Why not up the damage archery does?  Get rid of the Trueshot discipline.  Make crits hit more often and give us crippling blows with the bow.  Back to the damage of bows.<P>Could Archery be considered manaless casting? Yes and No.  Yes because, Tolan's Bracers and Mages can summon arrows like nobody's business but, those arrows could be considered inferior to the arrows that a Master Fletcher can make.  This is where the No comes into play.  10 Class 6 Arrows (8 Damage /100 Range)cost about 20 plat to make.<BR>A bow can cost anywheres from a few gold to hundreds of platinum. (This is from the standpoint of making these items as a master fletcher) Not to mention the 1000s of platinum to become a Master Fletcher of skill 200.  You could multiply the damage of the bow by the damage of the arrow and get near or even the damage a Wizard can do to a single monster.<P>A very extreme example without the Trueshot Discipline:<P>Efreeti Warbow (DAM 40/DELAY 100)<BR>Class 6 Steel Arrow (DAM 8)<BR>Present Max Damage           56<BR>Present Max Critical Damage  112<P>Proposed Max Damage          320<BR>Proposed Max Critical Damage 640<P>This is an extreme example but at about 32 damage per second (not guaranteed to hit every time and not guaranteed to max damage everytime AND not guaranteed to crit or max crit everytime) and at 2pp per shot, platinum, time ,and skill supplant Mana in this case.  Sure you could just make or buy 200 of these arrows and have a field day with the 50+ NPC's but someone has to make them, someone has to spend the platinum to get his or her skill up.  Is this a means to which parties comprised mainly of Rangers roam around killing everything in sight?<BR>It could be...but you do the math.  Some could die or some could develop the tactics to keep others from dying.  The materials are there, the talent is there.<P>  If you implement these changes across the board, Archery becomes viable, Fletching becomes viable, and a Rangers role as a Light Agile Warrior becomes true.  Is the willingness to sacrifice your pride for the sake of the game present?  Time will tell.<P>Dunkahn,<BR>Ranger of Karana</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan (Absor),<P>The Ranger community had to fight the good fight with the defensive skill cap issue with Abashi long ago (at Kunark release).<P>The whole point of this thread is that rangers did not get ANY defensive skill increases post Kunark while shadowknights and paladin received both offensive AND defensive skill increases. If paladins and shadowknights now receive the full defensive skill cap (what about the other defensive skills by the way), and rangers receive full offensive skill caps, then rangers are still getting shorted the amount of defensive skill caps that paladins and shadowknights were given to their offensive skills.<P>Your whole premise about rangers being more powerful than warriors is unfounded.  Warriors have better weapons, so with equal offensive skill caps (and no tripple strike), rangers cannot do more melee damage than a warrior.  <P>On defense, warriors will always have much more armor class and many more hit points as well.<P>The original poster was just stating that to create hybrid equalibrium, rangers should receive at least a bit of added defense.  That's all.<P>By the way, having power you cannot use is the same as being powerless, so what's the point?<P>Quisp<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This has been posted a lot already, but there has to be a way for a Ranger to do useful (significant) damage without aggroing a mob so much that the Ranger is forced to tank (and die).<P>Rangers either need some kind of aggro off ability (Jolt comes way too late compared to when a Ranger's problems begin and even then it is not effective enough) or a Ranger needs to be able to defend and dodge better.<P>I think a great solution would be to actually make agility count for something.  Tie it to defense more than the meager AC is allows for now.  Right now strength is the only truly meaningful stat for melee classes.  It would be nice if various classes needed various stats.  Str for warriors and pallys, agi for Rangers, dex for rogues and bards.  Obviously all classes should still have a value for each stat, but classes with an inherent strength in a particular stat should be able to relay that into a real game positive.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alen,<P>I was optimistic about the changes coming for the Ranger until I read your post.  I love the idea and role of a ranger, always have.  I was excited to start one but was able to see the weakness of my char even in the early stages.  But again I was optimistic about things.  The reason I was optimistic is because I read so many good post that gave great detailed examples of the problems the ranger class has.  I thought that surly with this much good information you will be able to see the problems with that Ranger class and *WILL* do something about it.  But it looks like I was wrong.  It looks like you have missed the point all together.  <P>I think that the part that killed me most was "Just because you CAN do a ton of damage, doesn't mean you should."  Ok, then you tell me what use is a ranger at all then?  We can't tank, we should not deal out the damage (which is not where it should be anyway) by your own admittance, we cannot heal for a group, we cannot transport a group, we cannot cast big damage spells, so what is it that we should do?  I cannot tell you how disappointed I am in your reply and at how you don’t seem to accept and understand that the ranger class sucks as is.  It is not that we are all playing it wrong, it is that the implementation is not working.  You took all the wind out of my sails that I had about the Ranger class being brought into the light as a group desired character.  I am torn now with what char to make next to replace my ranger, if I make one at all  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>&gt;&gt;----------&gt; IF YOU HAVE NOT READ IT YET, PLEASE READ THE POST BY THRYLL ON PAGE 2!! &lt;----------&lt;&lt;<P>It does a great job of summing up what I am feeling while making great, concrete, precise points.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Another thing! How come Monks and rogues, the real damage dealers, get a skill to get the agro off of them (FD and evade), but the Ranger gets a high mana costing, long casting spell?  And we get it in the 50's!  So if we can cast it without getting distracted, and if it is not resisted, then we might get moved down the agro list a little.  So instead of actually fighting and dealing damage, I am wasting all my time and mana on trying to get a mob less agro'ed to me.  Wow that sounds like fun.<P>"Yes, we would love to take a ranger to fight Vox!

</FONT><HR>"However, even when adjusting to this new role, I still do not find 200 defense acceptable. Do you? and please explain why."<P>I didn't say rangers were not meant to tank now.  I said that they were not meant to be the primary tank.  Again, I don't have post 50 experience, so it's hard to talk about that, but even in the mid 40s they seem to have a more difficult time as a primary tank.  I think their role is better suited to a secondary tank with a number of useful spells to help the party.  <P>I assume when Absor says they have great damage capability he's including the use of some of the higher end spells.  As i said before, in straight melee a dual wielding warrior should have little trouble taunting off of a ranger.  Adding in some decent spells could change that, but any caster knows that they have to be careful when to use the spells.  They ARE useful, but have to be used well.  I think the complaints about having great offense but not being able to use it are largely unfounded.  A wizard has amazing offense, but can't just use it whenever he/she wants, not and live anyway.  Timing is everything.  <P>Now, to answer the question, I think a small defense increase would be okay.  I don't like how verant's tests for upgrading paladins/SKs just immediately boosts their defense to warrior maxes.  Kind of stepping on some toes there...<BR>IF a change is deemed necessary, it should be small to see how it works out.  Verant can always up caps a bit more, but they'd have a riot if they decided they were too high and LOWERED the caps.  I still think that changing the way dual vs. 2 handed attacks taunt will fix much of the trouble.  Beyond that, try giving rangers a small bump up to say, 210 instead of 200.  Increases for paladins/SKs should be small to start with as well.  Fix the taunt!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I do not work for VI and I do not know the exact formula for figuring out who is aggro'ed and at what rate.  The job of the people posting is to post about the problems they see in the game and why, it is VI's job to figure out how to best address the problems.  Rather it is changing the taunt/aggro system, change a skill, or add new ones.  <P>It is just too bad that VI does not seem to be getting the point with the Ranger discussions.  They want us to be the offensive hybrid, but don't give us the ability to do so.<P>I have fought it for a long time, but I am sorry Ranges suck!

Seriously every Ranger knows they aggro more than their taunt and damage, I have seen it happen over and over and over again in personal experience with different characters across 46 levels in almost every zone in the game.<P>Things like backstab aggroing more when it fails than when it does maximum damage, spells aggroing more from a full resist than full damage, that all points to a basic problem.<P>THAT is your problem as Rangers, we don't need to know the mechanics of aggro to know its broken.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Posting this all over till it gets a response:<P>All melee classes should have gotten the same PERCENTAGE increases and AC/HP/caps as warriors got with the expansions.  Warrior cap from 225 to 252 is a 12% increase.  All other classes should have gotten the same 12% increase for their cap.  So a 200 cap for that stat would go to 224 for a ranger, and a 215 cap for that stat would go to 241 for a pally.  Repeat for all melee caps (1hs,2hs,dw,da,offense, defense, dodge, parry, riposte, etc.....) and other stats AC/HP.  But that didn't happen for all melee class's caps across the boards and is one of the reason for all this sound and fury.  For those that didn't get the same percentage boost (or no boost at all), life sucks in the end-game.<P>This assumes that folks were happy with the pre-expansion 'balance'.  I don't know if they were or not, but they almost HAD to be happier than now.  Its a simple solution and it makes sense; so there's no way it can happen.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>We're offensive tanks, according to Absor.<P>We have some nukes that add a little to our melee power (with the patch that kept spell casting from interfering with melee timers), however, they add a lot of taunt, so let's leave them out of the equation. After the offense changes are implimented on the live servers, warriors will STILL be able to do more damage due to critical hits, crippling blows, and triple attack assuming they're using the same weapon(s). That means we're a little worse than warriors at dealing damage, and since warrior are a little worse at dealing damage than offensive tanks...<P>Let's look at the other offensive tanks.<P>Rogues have backstab, which is one attack that does a lot of damage with less aggro than what a normal tank would have to build up doing that kind of damage, plus they have evade to reduce it (which isn't spell based, I might add). Other than that, they have the same offense caps as warriors, plus defensive caps, but they have weaker armor.<P>Monks have a special attack to add to their normal damage and have feign to reduce aggro (although it does have problems working on uber mobs, they get it at a pretty low level), plus the same defensive caps as warriors, but they have weaker armor.<P>Now, let's look at ranger defense. Our armor is weaker than the warrior's equivilant by several AC per piece, so we have weaker armor, so why do we pay a defensive and hit point penalty? Why would improving our best way of handling aggro to at least the ability of a monk be unbalancing?<P>Do spells really make that much of a difference to give us defensive abilities sub-par when compared to other offensive tanks? I really don't think so, especially since using them makes us get beat on that much more.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It seems you have this same "tunnelvision" as Verant does.<P>The aggro issue is secondary. The primary issue is UNDOING class IMBALANCE that Verant created. I'm repeating myself, EVERY class is playable AS IS, INCLUDING the ranger.  But THAT is not the issue (which Verant just doesn't seem to understand).  I am talking obsolesence now.  The ranger is OBSOLETE POST 50 DESPITE the proposed changes.<P>I've said THIS before too, it is SIMPLE MATH. That is what this game is all about from a mechanics point of view. It's all about NUMBERS, i.e., math.  <P>FIRST in offense, FIRST in defense is BETTER than FOURTH in offense, LAST in defense, hence THE FOREGOING will be more desireable than the LATTER.  So when the ranger (who is the latter) is looking for a group in the high end game he will almost invariably be picked as a last resort.  There is no balance.  There was before ROK, but not now.<P>Now if they refuse to put ranger defense back on par with all the other melee classes then make ranger FIRST in offense.  Then and only then, will it make any sense.  Because at least then groups might opt for uber damage at the expense of dealing with the poor defense of the ranger.  Since I'm already last in defense at least I might as well be that Number 1 damage dealer.  Fourth just doesn't justify it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Based on posts in this thread, high lvl rangers typically employ 2 low dmg low del weapons.  I have read that aggro is detrmined by the # of attempted atk's (including both meelee and casting).  Please note that an increase in aggro will occur even if an atk is unsuccessful, and the magnitude of the damage resulting from a successful atk has no effect on aggro.  If this is truly how aggro is determined, then a fast atk'ing player is in deep doodoo,  Especially if that player has low AC, low HP, and limited meelee avoidance skills (dodge, parry, etc.).  Hmmm, wonder why Rangers are complaining?<P>The solution:<P>Fix aggro, its broken, not Rangers.  It sounds like the original programmer(s) was either lazy or biased towards casters.<P>Let me explain my previous statement.  I suggest that the programmer(s) might have been lazy because the manner in which aggro is currently determined is probally an order of magnitude (hehe, for u non-engineer types "order of magnitude" means mathmatically greater by a decimal place, like 10 is an order of magnitude greater than 1) easier to implement than the ideal system that would account for successful/unsuccessful atk's and the amount of damage sustained during a successful atk.  In other words, the original programmer(s) opted for a quick and easy method of determining aggro, instead of a more elegant (and inherently more complex) solution.  However, I am not a programmer myself.  So i am willing to admit that the additional programming code required to implement the ideal aggro calculation system could cause problems for a couple reasons.  1st, the more code they add to the game, the more computing power required to play it.  2nd, since the game is already up and running, I don't know how hard it would be to change the existing code.<P>Now to explain why I think the programmer(s) might have been biased towards casters (nukers are the real issue).  If aggro was calculated based on the amount of damage dealt, then nukers would probally be having problems similar to those being experienced by Rangers.  They also have low hp, ac, and avoidance skills.  I am sure that it would be possible to develope an aggro calculation system that could fix all this, but the problem of implementing it remains.  This new "perfect" aggro calculation system might raise computing power required to play the game.  Why is that a problem u ask?  Well, here comes the bottom line.<P>Even though Everquest is a roleplaying game, there is a major differnece between it and the pencil and paper games it originated from.  From Verant's perspective, Everquest does not exist for your entertainment.  Verant is concerned with profits, just like any other corporation.  So if increased computer power is required to play the game, Verant's profits could decrease (i.e. all those people playing with 200Mhz, 32Mb RAM, 8Mb Video card, 33.6k modem, computers would nolonger be able to play).  No, I am not suggesting that simply changing the way in which aggro is calculated could prevent a significant portion of verant's clients from playing, but implementing several of these needed changes might.  So let's look at it a worst case senario from Verant's perspective.  If they implement change(s) "X", they loose 10% of of their customers because those customers have out of date computers and internet connections.  If they don't implement change(s) "X", they only loose 5% of their customers (the people who were pissed of about what ever needed to be fixed).  Easy to see why there are so many customer complaints.  Verant is trying to strike a balance between customer satisfaction and profit.  Verant knows they can piss you off and you will still play Everquest.  <P>Many of my statements are hypothetical, and some might even been exaggerations.  However, I think the concepts I was discussing are adequatly illustrated by them.  Personnally, I hope Verant will listen to us and make some changes.  They should realize that the more we love the game, the more likely we are to introduce other people (potential customers) to it.  <P>btw Fix the Pit of Doom in Halas!  How hard could that be?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Nilolin<BR>lvl 9 Ranger<BR>The Nameless      </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>all i gotta say is LMFAO-this is no better,well,at least no better it seems than the *****ing and whining  I had to do when i hated adn quit my ranger to start a mage,my mage got to 55 in 50 days played,with still friggin screwing around-my ranger is still 52 wtih 107 days played,you wanna know why,SAME FRAKIN REASON AS LAST YEAR,rangers have too few hp and ac,defense to survive the way they were meant to be.if you look at any and all rpg games out there,rangers had not the hp and not the OFFENSE of warriors,they had all the defense allowed by the wearing of chain armor and such,offense was always the land of the warrior,warriors should do more damage,and take more damage,rangers should do almost as much damage and have 5/10th the hp and 5/10th the ac.now only way for this to be fixed in my opinion,is to add another quarter percent to the ac modifier post 50,my ranger has 908 self buffed ac,with 3 pieces of tolans(bracer,arms,helm)call of earth,str of nature,steel skin,bramblecoat.and misc gear.i dont use haste belt,cause i get aggro'd on and get healed alot,but i do use rat whip and flux axe,cause i can take some beating with that amount of ac-so my opinion,pure ac is what matters,so increase our ac by one quarter point per ac point,and all should be good.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>okay...<P>Increasing our ac by 25% would make your 908 be 1135, which is higher than a lot of Paladins and SK's... Not gonna happen.<P>The changes on test have it right. Boost dmg output, lower Jolt (still think it should be 49, not 51, but hey, 49 to 51 ain't hard). The only reason I can see that they made the better version of Jolt be FR is because maybe Velious mobs have lower FR than other places, otherwise FR is the second highest resist on many things (which kinda blows).<P>Don't think SoW getting moved to 30 will make it into production, but maybe.. g'luck little brothers.<P>I haven't seen if any of the spell changes have added a spell to lvl 53 (by far the weakest spell level post 50).<P>I did choose ranger for the versatility, and for the offensive leaning as far as melee goes. Hopefully the changes on Test will have us closer to at least monk damage dealing. <P>If rogues are considered balanced with the amount of damage they do, rangers should be able to match that with melee and spells. That means our melee should actually do MORE damage than theirs, since our spells will never match backstab/double backstab damage. We pay similar penalties as far as hp's and ac gear go, far worse penalties in defense, so that should be about fair.<P>Some of the changes that have been put in to test have been there for a while now, I guess they are going to keep tweaking and move all the changes at once.<P>I only hope the changes make it into the game before the end of March... That might make the allure of AO be not quite as strong.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I read a lot of your posts and really don't consider myself as an expert on Rangers but would like to add a comment.<P>I play 3 Rangers one of each race. I do this for comparisons to see which races are easier to play as far as the class goes.<P>One thing that occurred to me while reading your posts is if there any vaule to have a super taunter in the group. To me it seams a Ranger can pace his damage out and if another character gets in trouble a Ranger can get it off of them. <P>The only problem I see here is that once the mob gets on you the other characters are going to have a hard time getting it off.<P>So with this in mind I was also thinking why Verant doesn't give Rangers ability to go totally defensive i.e. a discipline that can be invoked when a Ranger has turn his attack off such as Feet Like a Panther. This would give the Ranger X amount of seconds of super evasion.<P>After reading your posts am glad I created my Hal-Elf Ranger with 75 Wisdom. Maybe she won't have as much problems with the spells later on.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, the patch came out, and while we got most of the spells from test that they posted, and tracking seems to be fixed, seems the "hate" list issue is still that. Casters benifited the most it seems, and they did what we asked them not too and nerfed Evade for Rouges. It remains to be seen if these "fixes" are exactly that, but seeing as how now I cant even make it to the log on server I cant tell.

</FONT><HR>I personally don't think my ranger is in too bad of a shape.  I think the changes coming today will only make the class more fun to play.  My Ranger currently has 915 AC, self buffed.  In a group with a high level cleric, he goes as high as 950, with his ATK breaking 1k (self buffed).  A lot of the problems come from people that do not understand how to play a ranger.  You are not a tank, you are a jeep with a tank's cannon. :b<BR>I made a warrior, and a monk, and quite frankly...I find them pretty boring.  /shrug<BR>Just my 2 cents here, for what it's worth.<P>Taeolen Windchaser<BR>54th Elven Pathfinder of Tunare<BR>Innoruuk Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oh I know HOW to play my ranger, I've been doing it for almost two years now. Sure, if you are in an Uber guild, or a close circle of friends who you play with everytime you log in, then playing a ranger is no problem. In those situations your weakness are overlooked, and you are accepted on your merits as a person. Strangers do not to tend to be as forgiving. I stood side by side with a 43 Pally last night (Im 47) and took way more hits than he did, and he had a hell of a time getting mobs off of me. He was constantly healing me, and I was self healing when I could. Bottom line, he was down a bubb of health and no mana, I was down 2 or 3 bubbs of health and had 1/2 mana left. Not to mention the fact that I was 4 lvls higher than him, and had his buffs as well as my own. Nope, things are eschewed, nothing you can say (the two posters above this thread) will ever convince me that there is a way I can avoid the aggro that Verant says I should learn how to avoid. You are wrong, pure and simple. I have the masses on my side to attest to this. Stick with us please, for as long as you nay sayers exist our class will not be fixed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058414-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058414.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058414-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058414-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058414-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=058414&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=058414&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
