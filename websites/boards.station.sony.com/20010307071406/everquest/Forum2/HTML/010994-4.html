</FONT><HR>Convince me that no other class has compelling issues at any level that are waiting to be addressed, and I will fully endorse your campaign to empower 50+ rangers and retract my statements.  Until then, this thread is nothing more than a class-based whine and deserves nothing but scorn.  I don't deny that rangers have problems, but I DO realize that EVERYONE has problems (some more than others), not just rangers, and I see this post as a selfish gripe that Verant isn't coddling an individual player (SunMoon).  Want to see a troll, look at the original poster.  JButler called him a couple weeks ago?  And he posts this crap now?  Lame.  SunMoon maintains a nice site, but his ego is too big if he thinks that Verant owes him this kind of attention.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I am not full of myself at all. All I want is for people to understand that NOT ALL rangers feel like the INTITIAL post. It is an unfair assumption to say things like "majority" and "all". <P>There are MANY rangers out there that feel differently then the original poster.<P>&gt;What I and then a few others have done, is &gt;remind Sunmoon that he indeed has our support &gt;meaning those who have stated so), because it &gt;can be disheartening to see such statements by &gt;someone else such as what you've posted.<P>What did I say that was so disheartening? The mere fact that I and a few others on this post disagreed with you or the original poster? The original post was a foul tempered rant. I will not "support" that in any way.<P>You can remind Sunmoon directly. You don't need to attack someone because of a different view point.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Erolas, actually I was pointing out that you many not be aware that Sunmoon is in a position of leadership. I wasn't addressing your knowledge of Ranger issues whatsoever.<P>Further I haven't attacked you at all. I merely pointed out that your post was... an attack and not helping.<P>Yes, the original post was a rant, but why was it a rant? Is there a reason? Could it be that something was agreed to and not followed upon? Could it be that reasonable expectations where not meant? could it that many other posts, emails and conversations took place that were not rants, but well reasoned, informed attempts at opening and maintaining discussion?<P>Could it be that the original post stated 'a lot of us' and NOT all?<P>I'm not attacking you, however you are attacking others because they share a different viewpoint. Think about it.<P>FrodoLives, do you think all things can be dealt with simultaneously? <P>"I don't deny that rangers have problems, but I DO realize that EVERYONE has problems (some more than others), not just rangers,..."<P>Were you holding the same kind of fire when Rogues worked hard for the enhancements they needed? What about Shaman's Alchemy, do you feel they should have shut up until everyone could be addressed? <P>Or perhaps... one issue has to be dealt with at a time, and who better to approach class based issues than members and representatives of that class? <P>Selfish is it? If Rangers are 'fixed' would that not also benefit Clerics? Warriors? Enchanters? Everyone in the group that the Ranger is in?<P>Did it ever occur to you that if one thing can be solved, the book can be closed on it, and then others can be addressed?<P>You're right FrodoLives, it is more important that they release a $30.00 expansion pack before addressing current issues and problems, what was I thinking?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Pezz,<P>I appreciate that you have been on test and done many things to enhance melee classes. You also seem to have a pretty good handle on the ranger AC /defense dilema. One question I do have though is the following: Isn't riposte more of an offensive weapon than defensive? Shouldn't rangers get more riposte than other melee classes (excluding warriors). Forget about dodge/parry. I would think if you only boost one skill it should be riposte.<P>As for nerfing a moss twig, I disagree with that. I don't own one, probably never would have, but I still disagree. Any weapon that brings melee closer to a caster in balance should be encouraged by all melee classes, even those that can't use it. Casters are incredibly over-powered as compared to melee classes. I hope Verant never nerfs the rogue, finally a melee class that is getting closer to balance with caster classes.<P>My opinion on this is if 3 out of 7 caster classes can solo, then 3 out of 7 of the melee classes should be able to solo.<P>Make bow damage viable if it improves rangers chances to stay alive by doing damage out of melee combat. So what if rangers and warriors can now bow kite. Casters can do it, why shouldn't melee classes. <P>Longetalos</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

(someone earlier complained about content. all i can say to that person is add some.) hence his identity to many rangers who visit the glade is that of spokesman and people look to him for info and he normally delivers. i dont have a leader. i am my own leader. but i sunmoon to be the figure head of the ranger movement, even if he is not the most prominent to some or even known to many. i dont need a leader, nor do i want one. but we need a spokesman and sunmoon is what we have and he should be respected for that. and if i were to vote on it, sunmoon would get it.<P>i have been a member of the glade for more than a year. i have watched it grow and watched the ranger class fall behind. it is disapointing.<P>one last thing: all the rangers who keep posting here saying that sunmoon is out of line or that there is nothing wrong with rangers, i want you to do me and everyone else here ONE favor: please let us know what LEVEL you are. <P>this WHOLE issue is an issue regarding HIGH level rangers, mostly 50+ and generally KUNARK related. i can go to Efreeti in SolB and have ZERO problems being the ranger i have grown to be. were i to do the same in Karnor, on GREEN mobs, i would NOT be able to FUNCTION effectively for the group.<P>if you do NOT fall into this category (50+, Kunark Ranger) then you really should just comment your support because, and i hate to say this, you are not talking from a position of knowledge. surely 45+ is when rangers start to see the problems, but they do not come into full swing until the other classes's new defensive skill caps start to significantly out distance ours (and let me remind again, that pre-kunark rangers had better parry/dodge than paladins and SKs but while they got significantly increased with these skills (and in riposte and defense) rangers got NOTHING here. there were NO increases in any of these skills.

They way they were growing there should be be 50 servers by now but nerfs, and 'the I dont have time to play EQ anymore' syndrome that hits once you get higher up and have to start the camping for good items slowed their formerly explosive growth to a slow trickle forceing them to depend on asian and european markets. (That increased the cramped 24/7 feeling on some servers because they play during times the U.S. players dont often do, though Smedley loved it since they pay for bandwith based on peak usage numbers he said in an interview.)

</FONT><HR>Aradune, <P>Sunmoon speaks for me.  When Sunmoon posts encouraging news on The Rangers Glade, I feel that there is hope and soldier on.  When he despairs, I wonder how much more time and money I should invest in this game.  I suspect that most high level rangers feel the same way.<P>I understand Sunmoon's post, even if you don't.  He was very encouraged after talking to Jeff and that bubbled over to much of the ranger community.  Unfortunately, this was followed by a period of little-to-no communication except for the occassional disheartening "Rangers-are-balanced" post from Abashion the whineplay board.<P>Nobody expected you to fix this overnight.  We did expect you to *continue* to communicate with us about it.  We made it easy, since most of us are willing to have Sunmoon act as our class ambassador.  You failed.<P>What are you left with?  A class that most people will quit playing at 51.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

So in order to get attention to their cause, they feel they have to take drastic measures).<P>Before you go off on me to comparing this post to Terrorism, my view of it is that it is caused by a lack of communications and bad judgment on both sides.

</FONT><HR>Jomek,<BR>  <BR>  Yes, companies that have a customer center to deal with complaints and inquiries do in fact call back their customers.  That's their job.<BR>  However, a head of development does not call most of their customer base.  That's not their job.<BR>  <BR>Example, if I have a problem with my credit card.  I call the customer service line.  I get a representative who helps me and if they need more time, they'll call back.  The Head of the Customer service division doesn't call me back, it's the CSR.<P>Additionally, if I called up and said, the current interest rate isn't quite right for my card when other cards get a lower APR, I would like to discuss it with the marketing department, I'd probably get laughed at.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I am NOT a ranger.<BR>I AM a DRUID.<P>that being said I would like to point out a few things.. rangers need VERY LITTLE on the side of a defensive boost... what a good chunk of you need is to play a druid... I am not saying switch... I am saying LEARN.<P>You are 25-50% druid are you not?<BR>Druids have EVEN LOWER defensive abilities is this true?<P>You know what we druids do? No... you don't.. and that is 75% of your problem. 25% of it is you need better defensive skills.<P>here are a few examples :<BR>#1) What are thorns for?<BR>the ranger says 'to increase my damage output!'<BR>BUZZZZZ WRONG DUMB ASS.<BR>the druid says 'to keep the mob glued to the warrior.'<BR>DO NOT cast thorns on yourself.  That is FOOLISH. Cast it on the guy with the highest AC and a good damage output.  If I was a ranger, monk or thief I would be HIGHLY PISSED if someone cast thorns on me.... they just glued a pissed off MoB to you back... that is like being handcuffed to a damn Rhino.... a very STUPID STUPID thing to let happen.<P>#2) When is it a good time to snare?<BR>the rangers says 'any time is a good time'<BR>WRONG... <BR>the druids say 'after half-life if it all possible.. maybe earlier if you are resisted alot by this kind of mob.'<P>Snareing is a BIG taunt... Wait a bit... let the tank *****-slap it silly.... then snare.  You will not be aggro'd as quick.<P>#3) How come when I DoT and Nuke I die<BR>the rangers says 'I dunno... the VI gods gave me this much mana and I gotta use it... and yet the mobs kill me when I do.<BR>the druids say 'Damn... I did too much damage again.. serves me right... double DoTs will kill me everytime unless kiting or rooting the mob.  I should almost ALWAYS have 1/2 mana used during a fight... never full I don't know why I got trigger happy.'<P>Casters don't dish out damage as quick as possible.... we time it.... hence why are butts have little dimples it it from the stones nearby... we meditate alot.<P>#4) Why when a Mob aggros on me I can't get it off?<BR>the ranger says 'I dunno.. I run around and he follows me'<BR>the druid says 'when it aggros on me I should not nuke... I should turn my attack off... even my puny mace hits add me to the hate list... and Damn.. why did I cast those thorns on myself? that was STUPID! Even when I turned off my attack it was double hitting for 102 each and taking 29 points a smack back... that is nearly 60 points a round. Sometimes I am just off my game.'<P>I hope that helped you guys some.  You have to LEARN the ways of the Druid in order to survive.  I think perhaps you just need a MINOR jump on the good old dodge cap... but JUST A LITTLE ONE. <P>You guys just need to learn new tactics... I was a tank druid until lvl 28... that does not work now.... I adapted.<P>Pepto lvl 51 druid - veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

However, you can not afford to wait sometimes in huge battles where confusion reigns. Moreover, you have to factor in resists.<P>#3) How come when I DoT and Nuke I die<BR>the rangers says 'I dunno... the VI gods gave me this much mana and I gotta use it... and yet the mobs kill me when I do.<BR>Rarely do any Rangers I know manadump. The only time I do is when it is the last mob standing before a long med session, or a caster that needs to be burned down quick.<P>#4) Why when a Mob aggros on me I can't get it off?<P>I have never, ever, ever seen a Ranger run around screaming get it off. We're not wimpy-ass finger wagglers ya know!<P>Pepto, I think yer a pretty good druid. I sure as hell wouldn't tell you how to play your class. Roll up a nice 51 Ranger and try to play.. then you will begin to see what we are talking about.<P>We are only 25% druid at most.

</FONT><HR>I really hate seeing people attack each other.  Sometimes they are irrational attacks.  Sometimes they are rational.  Still though, people should try to keep in their passion.<P>As for Sunmoon, I understand his frustration.  This is forgivable in a way; he has selflessly helped other rangers.  True, he is a ranger himself, and he loves his class.  Nevertheless, I must admire him for his ability to gather these hosts of rangers.  I would not call this selfishness.  Why would Sunmoon go through all this just to help rangers out?  I personally believe it's beyond "class envy."  He does not thrive on other rangers.  Hell, he would challenge Verant face to face and present a list of flaws over the ranger class.  Well, he already has  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Well, there are two ways a person could think after he/she sees Sunmoon do such an audacious act: 1) he is fulfilling his own ego and desires (negative)  2) he is helping his fellow rangers.  Knowing how stubborn people can be, I will not try to change the views of other people.  There really can't be hard evidence behind either side as philosophies can't be 100% proven or 100% disproven (unless the philosophy is like: I'm right, you're wrong, end of story  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">).  Also, being uncontrollably(sp?) passionate does not equate to being stupid.  Look up the definitions.  Talking about definitions, definitions of concept or ideas (not concrete like "rock" or "air") are kinda personal.  There is no "true" definition.  Even dictionaries aren't 100% correct.  The best they can give are vague descriptions.<P>Well enough of that.  Humans are flawed.  Why, our logic may even not be universal.  We can't comprehend the idea of infinities well, but who knows?<P>Ok, enough of that, and I mean it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I am not totally ignorant of ranger issues fortunately, and I will not make a total fool of myself).  There are certain questions/steps to be asked here:<BR>1) What are rangers in your view?  Elaborate.<BR>2) Are EQ's ranger like those of your view of rangers?  At here, people can argue that this is Verant's game, etc.  Verant does depend on customers.  But it's kind of like a democracy: support the majority.  I'm kinda neutral here.<BR>3) How do you propose to fix it to be THE ranger?  Elaborate.<BR>4) What are the problems of your idea?  Try to prevent pride or other emotions from clouding your logic.<BR>5) Using 3) and 4) make a revised plan.<BR>6) Repeat 5) again until it seems the "best."  This step is the hardest, because it is impossible to know what the best is.  Our minds aren't capable of knowing what the best is, but we can make things "better."<BR>This will take deep thought of course.  These steps, or something similar, should get rid of those "idiots" who can't "think."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>One feature they need on the boards is an ignore feature. Then I could place FrodoLives on it. Nothing he has said applies to the issue. He seems to be the type of individual who feeds off kindling emotional responses.<P>That said, I will try and place our situation into perspective with an analogy.<P>I live in a community with good roads. One day the city decides to add a new parkway to make the community better. Most of the neighborhoods get improved sevice because of this new road.<BR>However, in one neighborhood they left a gap at the end of the street. Well, the people in the neighborhood get together and find one person to express their discontent to city hall.<BR>He contacts the mayor and is told it will be looked into. Months go by. He repeatedly calls, sends letters and email, and even makes a visit to city hall in hopes this will be fixed.<BR>He realizes that its a big city with lots of people, but this problem is very important to his community. Eventually he loses his cool because he feels his neighborhood's request is continually being ignored. So he eventually gives up and moves.<P>This is what happened here. When the new road (Kunark) was put in, there was a gap left at the end of our street. Sunmoon is our neighborhood representative. But the mayor and all the council members continue to ignore our problem. So Sunmoon lsot his cool and is now is about to give up and move. <P>It's not class envy, its a gap in the road. We just want it fixed.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well, I don't post here much, I don't post on the many boards for that matter, but I am a ranger, and an avid follower of the Glade.<P>Sure, there aren't a slew of Udates on the glade, but in a class specific environment, especially one that is nt often updated (rangers in game, I mean), then there won't be a lot of site updates.<P>Where the meat of information on the Glade comes from is the Message boards.  I don't always agree with all my ranger brethren, but I find the wealth of information there for rangers to be useful.<P>Basicly, I support Sunmoon and mourn the loss of such a vital voice of rangers around the world of Norrath.  For all his critics, I say this: when have you fought so hard for a cause you believe in?<P>Enough about that.<P>I am only 46th level, so I cannot say I have experienced the main problem here for myself.  However, in my former guild, there were two rangers above level 50, (one is 54, one is 53), and in my current guild, there is only one ranger over 50, and she is 52 I believe.  I have grouped with all these rangers and have seen them get beat down as quickly as I did, and they had far superior gear (AC wise), not to mention the amount of levels on me.  I know that a green mob in Kunark can take half my hitpoints from me when I solo it, and that is with every damage shield up, and "high dmg/taunt" 1Hslashers.  <P>Now, I have loved rangers since I was 12 and picked up AD&D for the first time (I am 27).  At first, the only reason I bought EQ was becase they had rangers.  Kiri is my first character I ever created.  I have tried to play other classes, and I just didn't like them near as much.  This does not mean, however, that I think rangers are without problems.  Many classes have problems, but rangers, as it stand, are not what I envisioned a ranger to be.<P>As per a suggestion earlier, I will tell you what I always saw a ranger as, and point out the comparison in EQ.<P>1) Rangers were hearty outdoorsmen, the protectors of their lands (not woods exclusively), with forests being the most common.  They were rugged but agile, strong and wise.  Looking at that alone, EQ did a good job of giving them higher AGI, and a decent starting WIS.  THey should have been a little more in STA and STR, but that seems to hold fine in EQ demographics.  What they lack is HP.  A ranger should not have the HP of a Warrior, but easily more than, if not equal to, a Paladin (who lived in cities, castles, and luxury) or Shadowknights (who are the evil equivelent of a Paladin).<BR>  <BR>2) Rangers were always better at wielding two small weapons than any other class, and they earned this by sacrificing the damage absorbtion of the heavier armours, often wearing nothing better than Chain.  This allowed them to move more effectively, and was utilitarian in nature.  EQ got the restriction of type down (although I think seeing green PLATE is kinda neat, it's just not in the spirit of a ranger IMO), and yes, the AC should be lower than other classes, BUT a ranger should be better with Dual wielding weapons (but not better than a warrior), and should be ableto doge, parry, and riposte more effectively than any other.  Their damage avoidance is in those skills.  Notice I said avoidance and not absorbtion.  Leave absorbing damage to the heavier armoured and slower moving classes.  (IRL note: as a martial artist, I know I would rather dodge a blow than to roll with the damage, have padding take the damage, etc). <P>3) rangers, again, were masters of the woods. They were unequalled in trracking, hunting, and woods lore.  Well, I have stated for a long time that Tracking needs major work in EQ.  It's useful as is, but has much much more potential.  I'll save that for another day (although since VI is on a /command kick, how about giving us /tracktarget) and another thread.  Hunting, well, hunting involves stealth and cunning, as well as skill with a bow.  our sneak is okay, but in the woods or in nature, a ranger should be able to sneak/hide as a rogue does.  THink about it, when I go into the woods at Archery season, I am wearing a lot of camo, and I am moving as silently as possible to get within decent range of that deer.  Rangers would be doing the same I think. <P>4) rangers excell in archery.  In nearly every AD&D book out there, they give RObin Hood as an example of a ranger.  In nearly all fantasy novels and genres, anyone who falls into the typical ranger archetype, excells with a bow.  In EQ, bows are nothing more than hobby as designed.  I still work at fletching (which is horribly expensive for all the return we get), and I still use my bow.  But, most people envision rangers doing fantastic shots with their bows, and rightly so.  We grew up shooting distances in the woods, not at some wide open area with a target and a haybail.  We should be better than anyone with a bow.<P>5) Rangers Magics were Utilitarian and Nature oriented.  Well, so far that's been the case, although the priority is a bit skewed.  SoW at 39?? how is it reasonable we wait so long for that spell?  We do have a nice spell base, I will admit, but often, our spells are too little too late.  I can blow half my mana just healing two bubbles of my own hps, and for me not having many hps to begin with, that's pretty sad.  At level 30, our Swarm DoT is pretty inconsequential other than making me feel better that I won't have to swing an extra 5 times, or 3 with a 2Hander.<P>Right now, that is pretty much the most I can think of.  I'm tired, and I don't feel like hoggin up all the bandwidth.<P>I do want to address the whole "stats being pointless thing" though.  The stats are there for a reason, they do have an effect.  THe problem with seeing that is many are used to a lower point range for stats, so the effects are much more apparent.  Granted, in EQ, 2 points to a stat has very little meaning.  But stat bonuses do help somewhere, and where do you think that is?  Do you honestly think the stats are in the game just for people to brag? or to add numbers in a space the designers didn't know how to fill in the UI?  Agi has its effect in more than just AC, and yes, I believe it does affect Dodge, Parry, and Riposte.  While I may not have too much fath in Verant right now, I don't think they would put something in the game for no apparent reason.<P>As for my stance on the Expansion:  do we really need one already?  It was stated pre-Kunark (like a month or two pre-Kunark) that many items and quests had not been found yet.  I would assume with Kunark this had at minimum doubled.  As it stands now there is really no need for more zones, more items, more quests, etc.  I would prefer that in the year following Kunark that VI focussed on every problem and bug at hand, rather than introduce a hundred more when Velious goes live before it is finished.  I was not impressed when Kunark leeches made human sounds....and I was not all that impressed with the number of glitches in the game before Kunark came out.  My other disappointment was that VI wasn't willing to upgrade it's existing graphics to match those of Kunark.  Most games I have ever played released patches to fix problems, and expansions usually (not always) came out after all the patching was done.  Personally I see an expansion a year rather tedious and unneccesary.  Fix what you have us paying for before you ask us to spend even more money.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I have played a ranger up to 47th level and retired her, I now play a 53rd level enchanter.<P>Here is the problem as I see it.<P>Verant has said class balance is not so much each class being able to do so much damage or beet another class in PVP as it is having a compeling reason to be invited into a group. Look at the enchanter, I almost never have any damage spells loaded, ive gone the whole night without doing 1 point to a mob, but Im a highly desired group member.<P>Now take my ranger, there just isnt that much of a reason to invite her into your group, and there are some fairly strong reasons to keep her out.<P>If I was forming a group I would want a tank, well rangers cant do this well anymore at high levels so a warrior/SK/pally is better.<P>If I want an secondary damage dealer, Monks and Rogues far out do rangers in shear damage, and monks bring FD pulling, and rogues can open all those locked doors to the realy good loot in Kunark.<P>If I want a someone to snare, I can get a SK and have strong secondary melee, I can get a druid and get great spells and evac, or necro and get great dots and a pet that will outdamage a ranger.<P>If I want a utility character, I can get a Druid and get much better damage shields, snare, evac, regen, and a ton of other buffs. Or I can get a shaman and get slows, stat buffs out the wazzo, a pet, lots of Dots and probably free bracer damage all night long.<BR> <BR>If I want a backup healer, then a Druid, Shaman, or Pally are all superior to the ranger.<P>I just dont see a compelling reason why I would want a ranger in my group. They would realy be the LAST choice of all classes. If im wrong here please tell me why? But the only reason I see to invite a ranger is if they are a personal friend, and if you do that your weekening your group because you could of had a better class.<P>Even if I wanted a tracker for an outside zone, I would prefer a Druid or Bard since their tracking range is more usefull than a rangers in most cases.<P>Then consider that this class that doesnt add much to my group is going to take 40% more exp to level which means I will get less exp per kill made.<P>Also, consider that because they are going to get agroed on badly if they want to operate anyware near 100% effectiveness, by duel wielding, your cleric will spend a larger percentage of their mana healing the ranger, and you will have increased downtime. Therefore you have a big reason not to ask the ranger to join.<P>The only other choice is to do as many have suggested and have the ranger not join in combat right away, not to snare, or use a shield, or to do something else to reduce how much the mob hates him or her. Once again I have to ask why would I want someone who cant deal damage at thier max rate in my group? It sure isnt for that awsome immolate 182pt dot or 99pt DD spell they have at level 50!<P>Sure Rangers spells are very versitile. But most of them are ineffective at the level they are recieved at, for the types of mobs you will be fighting. Please dont say, "but you have SOW and Snare", because without the ability do do damage at range they are mainly good for running away.<P>Dont get me wrong, I like my ranger. I keep my ranger around for when I want to do quests and things like that. Shes great to go find something like the Ton Warrior I needed for the Iksar illusion, or to get the key to Old Sebilis, but she just doesnt do enough for a group that I feel I want a ranger in my group and has enough negatives to justify excluding her if ANY other choice exists.<P>Thats why I feel rangers are not balanced and need to be fixed.<P>My personal choice would be to improve archery to a real skill they could use rather than depending 100% on melee and week spells. I would like to see this mainly so their would be more variation in the game rather than all casters or all melee. By the way, the argument against archer used to be about non mana, non melee damage being unbalancing. In my opinion that kinda went out the window with the Jaundiced Bone Bracer didnt it? If a shaman can stand back and do 280 some points every eight seconds by right clicking on their bracer plus do all the other stuff a shaman can do, would it be so unbalance for a ranger to be able to shoot for that same type damage per second?<P>However, I doubt Verant would consider that. They are just to afraid of unleashing a new kiting monster. But done correctly it could ad a whole new dimension to rangers.<P>But something needs to be done to give groups a reason to invite a ranger. The most obvious it to fix their defense a bit so that they can deal damage and not become a mana sink on your cleric.<P>Just please do something because I used to like playing my ranger before it became next to impossible to find a group.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Whitewulf/Ravenwulf:<P>First off i acknowledge that i have only gotten through the first page of this post so far, so someone else may have already made a statement to you which is like the one i will make,  but i wish to type this while its still fresh in my mind.  If i am being repitious i do appologize.<P>First off a litte story to discredit your theory of FBSS and Duel Wield  being the main factor when the group warrior is using a 2hs...<P>At lvl 46 while in a full group camping the Frenzy in Lguk this past saturday i noticed an odd curiousity, the Warrior in our group was a lvl above me (47), and Duel wielding two SSoY  and wearing an FBSS the same as me.  Add to this that he was Disarming and Taunting his tail off while i was doing neither (i was kicking, but his kick is considerably higher than ours as well i believe) i was getting the aggro AT LEAST 50% of the time, and no i was not snaring, the druid in the group was.  So as you can see this is more than just a "direct input" aggro, there is more behind it.<P>At lvl 45 i noticed a  "hmm...  these mobs don't seem to like me much"   At lvl 46 the aggro became definately noticeable as my story pointed out, and  at lvl 47 it is becoming a bit of a danger...  (am barely 48 haven't had time to experience it yet) i can only imaging what this is like in the mid-high 50's.  So as you may see this a bit worse than you think if you believe that simply laying back a little will make all the difference.<P>Yes i know, your still not convinced,  you still stand by your point that this is simply "what we give up"  no matter how bad it is in reality to what you can imagine,  but lets take a step farther back and look again.<P>You say that poor defense and high aggro is what we give up for our great offense (though offense, 1hs, DW, Kick are still lower than Warriors. No im not comparing classes im just pointing out the fact of a non-direct input aggro again).  Put bluntly, we get higher offense and lower defense than the other hybrids, and they get higher defense and lower offense.  I agree that this sounds fine, dandy, and fair, except one problem.  What is the point of trading our defense and aggro for our offense,  if we cant even use the offense to full advantage without dying because of the trade off?  I DO lay off the mobs to save my healer mana and lower chances of death,  and the end result is that i'm inflicting the same if not LESS amount of damage as another hybrid would, yet still have lower defense and MUCH worse aggro.  Seems pretty useless to me.<P>Many people suggest to me that if im not happy i should just quit my ranger and make another character.  Three problems. <P>1. I have had EQ and this character as not only my primary character but my ONLY character for over a year now, and alas i am still only lvl 47. I do not have the time to put into a new character, i barely have the time to put into this one.<P>2. I love being a Ranger in essance, and what a Ranger stands for.  As soon as i found i COULD be a Ranger on EQ my mind was made up, those are the values, ethics, beliefs, and skills i have always enjoyed RPG'ing.  The fact that on EQ i've found their "Ranger" portrays little of what historically a Ranger is, i have come to understand and accept, and hold no (okay perhaps very little is better) grudge about.<P>3.  Many of my closest and oldest friends on EQ were fellow Rangers.  Perhaps i should underline the word WERE.  About 80% of them either no longer play EQ or are playing other twink classes.  Many of those have actually already done what Sunmoon is now doing and have Deleted those characters all together.  One thing i have discovered in this is that it is very hard to continue a close friendship in this game when you are completely unable to group and hunt with those friends, because you are suddenly killing bats and rats all over again. And i do not wish that same fate upon me.<P>"Then if you don't like it just quit" is another common bit of "advice"  i'm given.  <P>Well i do enjoy EQ as a whole,  i enjoy the close friendships, camradiry ( 10:1 says i spelled that one wrong  :P  ) and adventure.   Though, this probably will be the end result.  As i continue to lose more close friends,  and the task of simply getting a group (and when i actually get one then staying alive) becomes continuously and exponentially harder, then one night while truly angry, upset, and frustrated i WILL end up hitting that delete key.  My only hope is that things will change before that.  As i already said i do not have the time, energy, or will to put into creating a new character. <P>Dahrken Woodshadow  <BR>Defender of the Wood<BR>47th Ranger of Prexus<P>my word is my promise...<BR>my honor is everything...<P>FOR THE HONOR OF SUREFALL!!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010994-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010994.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010994-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010994-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=010994&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=010994&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
