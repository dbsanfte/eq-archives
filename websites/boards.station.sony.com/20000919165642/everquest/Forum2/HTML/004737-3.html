</FONT><HR>I've played on Tallon Zek, and from the message boards http://pub7.ezboard.com/btallonzektimes4735 and others, I hear that high level pvp is NOT fun.<P>People on this server have been pleading for a while now for Verant to do something about cross-team and out-of-range healing. Fixing these exploits would go a lot farther in helping ALL the players, rather than investing time and resources into a level 60 wrestling match.<P>Call me cynical, but I see this as just an obvious EQ media event. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>While I think the intent of these competitions is well meant, I think the actual events themselves are useless and a waste of resources.<P>First everyone knows that EQ melee combat is almost devoid of anything resembling strategy. Sure, in PvP situations you have to react a lot, but mainly all you are doing is exploiting problems with the game to give yourself an advantage (IE: strafing attacks degenerates combat to the person with the most suitable internet connection).<P>But, even ignoring that, these competitions are going to come down to who is level 60 and who has the best "uber-loot". PERIOD.<P>Equipment makes a HUGE difference in your fighting ability in this game, and to allow anyone to bring their best equipment to the fight degenrates the competition into an elitest event for the select few uber-guilds.<P>We have the hypocrosy of verant declaring on one hand that no one person has the "right" to any item in this game, while at the same time they organize and promote an event that can only be won by players who have indeed been fortunate enough to aquire the best items. <P>AND, we ALL know it wasn't just because they "earned" it as Lady_Daegarmo attests a couple of pages back... rather many players have this equipment SOLELY because they are part of large uber-guilds, or because they got an item pre-nerf, or because they were lucky enough to be in a zone before it was "fixed", etc.. ad naseum  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>Once again, Verant is rewarding those players who are part of uber-guilds, and who can camp things 24/7. <P>Why not spend the same time and energy designing an event that is fun and FAIR for all. Make some secret quests up and let everyone on the server try to solve them in a given time. Why not just make GM events that people can observe to try and give some life to this game? <P>In 20 months of playing EQ I saw maybe 3 GM events and most were basically just a GM controlled NPC trying to talk to people and then maybe some other NPC's spawning and killing people. Why not make a play or something? Hire some REAL actors to play NPC's, maybe have them kill a dragon or something, while all real PC's are prevented from fighting, casting or even talking, so they can observe lag free.<P>I mean... for such a huge game, I have never seen such poor attempts made to try and develop a "history" for this game. Even the books in game are all slapped together in a day and put there full of spelling errors.<P>Combat tournaments just won't cut it. Fighting in EQ is too level and item dependant, so unless you want to hold seperate competitions for each level and with restrictions on the armor/weapons allowed, you will ALWAYS be shafting a majority of the players who want to compete, because they will not be at the top of a level range and will not have uber-guild acquired super loot.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>An amended repost of a suggestion I had for an event that would involve a lot more people than the tournaments:<P>An example of a GM event many can participate in: Many prisoners of varying races have escaped from somewhere like Highhold. They have scattered all over Norrath, but there is a bounty out for them.<BR>Add several NPCs to the heart of several dungeons and cities(Upper Guk, the attic of some buildings in Qeynos or Freeport, deep in Najena, etc.)<P>Each NPC drops something to prove that they were caught.<P>Now add a twist: The NPCs are have the typical aggro of their race. If someone indifferent or better to them hails them, they reveal part of a conspiracy that their captors were trying to suppress. When they have given their information, they hand a written description of it to the 'hailer' and despawn (no doing both quests per NPC  )<P>Undoubtedly some information would be lost due to bloodthirsty players, so have another event a little later that gives the community another shot at getting this data. (but only the data that was not obtained in the first event, that should be shared by the PCs. Only repeat the data if the PCs that get it don't share it for some reason)<P>Eventually, if everyone is sharing their info, the plot can be uncovered, and a major raid can be performed to stop whatever is happening. One NPC in each city must be taken out by a group of players. This NPC will get no help from any of the normal NPCs in the game, so you don't have to wipe out the entire city to get the bad guys.<P>The benefits of this style event:<P>1. Since the mobs are non-aggro, you don't wipe out tons of newbies with the event.<BR>2. Since it is wide spread, with varying levels in different dungeons and cities, many people can participate in it, and even newbies can participate in it just by exploring their home cities.<BR>3. Sharing information between people will be encouraged, since it will become obvious their is not second chance at the info.<BR>4. By requiring raids in different cities, but ones in which the locals won't defend the target (who is only hinted at by the evidence, not absolutely fingered - gotta make the right guess or else a whole city aggros you  ) you can encourage cross-guild cooperation since even many larger guilds may not be able to field a big enough force to raid Oggok, Grobb or Neriak by themselves without having to wipe out the entire population.<BR>5.  By having the finale include each city, every newbie in the game (except maybe the Iksar, although you could probably include Kunark) would be able to witness it.<P>Perhaps after each city 'boss' is defeated, the final master conspirator could be tracked across Norrath - he could be moving at spirit of norrath speed so groups of people would need to 'pen him in' with some good coordination.<P>Just a suggestion.<BR>Mike<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I think it sounds interesting, and look forward to seeing how it turns out!<P>However, it sounds like these events<P>a) include only a small portion of the population (55+)<P>b) are all combat oriented.<P>How about a storytelling event? Have people sign up, regardless of level. They get 15 minutes (or however long you would want to set it at) to tell a roleplaying story. Best storyteller earns a title, perhaps ("the Raconteur"), or something along those lines. This would also be a good event because you wouldn't have to lock out a zone; in fact, people might enjoy listening to the stories that others have to tell!<P>Or, perhaps a fishing event? Have it on the docks in Firiona. You get 10 minutes, whoever catches the largest Fetid bass (they actually come in different sizes!) wins. If you had ties, winner would be decided on who caught the most fish.<P>Neither of these events would be restricted to race (except perhaps in location, but you could try and pick a fairly netural place), class, or level! And it might show that the Verant staff does want EverQuest to be more than just a "hack and slash" type game.<P>Just some thoughts!<P>--<BR>Thalanar Solal<BR>Cleric of Tunare<BR>Silver Shadows<BR>                       http://silvershadows.n3.net/</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I like the idea of more events. I'm not really into PvP that much, so I think I'd prefer the challenges, and definitely the competitions to the PvP-based tournaments. But it is nice to see people have some fun.<P>A suggestion, though - I can appreciate wanting to keep people away from the event to prevent interference, but could there be a way to let people watch? Like hand out NO RENT items that let people right-click for Cast Sight to watch the fight from different combatants? I would imagine you have a way to prevent people from using /says, /oocs, /auctions, and /shouts, if you want to keep noise down. Just seems like a shame that people can't be spectators.<P>Other than that, great ideas for the events.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Bravo to VI for putting the resources and people into running more events. These all sounds real well thought out, good job on that, Lady_Daegarmo. Ignore all the negative posts. You can't please everyone all the times. These people are extremely unreasonable, just within this thread, there are ideas for like what, 3000 events? And they want these events now, and these events to be done _their_way_ to _their_sastifaction_ or they will be complaining about it again and again and again. Well, they will complain one way or another. Ignoring them is a good idea, I will say  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>To those who say this favor Uber guilds and such, bleah, to a certain extend, that's true, but guess what? If you put in the time, you should have the advantage. Consider this, 2 boxers gonna fight each other, one spend 16 hours a day working out and training, the other one lazes around during the day and party at nite. When the time come to fight, of course the hard working one should have the advantage. Are you telling me that it should NOT be that way?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>The above example is kinda extreme... I am surprised that people put so much weight into equipments... If you are a good PVP player, you should be able to compenstate for it. If not, then you have no business competing. <P>The standards for competition shouldn't be lower so that somebody who can't run a character, with no equipment can participate.<P>Not that I am in a Uber guild nor have any char that's level 55.

</FONT><HR><BR>This game is primarily PvE, not PvP, so I think the emphasis on duel events is misguided.<P>I recognize that they're easy to implement, but I think the time would be better spent on developing in-game events like:<P>1) recover x items:<P>Example:<P>The Archmage Lionheart seeks to summon the lost elemental of shadow.  For years he has sought to collect the 7 Sigils of the Forgotten Elements to craft the spell of shadow.  Now on the eve of his triump the sigils have been stolen.  He shall richly reward the first TEAM that returns him the 7 sigils (and some level of reward for all who complete the quest within 2 weeks or something)<P>2) Monster-slaying<P>Example: A great King to celebrate his reign announces a great hunt.  He shall reward those who bring him the heads and skins of (insert diverse mobs, perhaps even new ones that are only put up for the duration of the event).<P>3)Invasions/temporary zone changes<P>Example: On brell we recently had a drachnid invasion in dreadlands.  It was fun for everyone.<P>And so on.<P>I think the majority of us aren't playing a PvP game, so not sure why the emphasis on PvP in events...<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

If one is taking too much damage they can just keep moving while they heal up (trolls and iksar have regen).<P>Disciplines won't matter because the opponent can simply retreat out of range until it times out.

It's not too difficult totally crank on resist gear, especially if you know you're only fighting a puny caster and won't have to burn away 2000+ warrior hp.  Each caster will cast See Invis, target the other, dispell a few times to eliminate Manaskin or Manasink, and crank out Lures until they're dead or the opponent is.  No stuns (resisted), no invis to hide, nothing but chain casting.  The problem here is the 60 wizard has Lure of Ice, which outputs 30% more damage.<P>I see this as pretty cut and dry.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
