</FONT><HR>Aaargh. No,please no.<BR> <BR>We need changes made to the classes at 50+ that no longer require monsters with 100,000 zillion HP,total MR,and quads for 850 to be "challenging" to the highest characters.<BR> <BR>Bumping everyone's offense AND defense up only means we get to see ourselves reduced to mush by still MORE uberish monsters. What'll be next after Velious,monsters with AE deathtouches that eat your corpse afterwards?<BR> <BR>As it stands,warrior damage output will drop through the floor in these encounters with Defensive fixed to reduce that warrior's damage as well as what he takes from a target...imagine what warrior/cleric/rogue will take to do now.<BR> <BR>Balance the SK,and as part of doing the balance,nerf uber monsters and even some regular mobs at high levels,allowing more MR-based stuff to stick. Right now,from what I get from the SK elders,these fights are "hit too hard,hit too fast,lasts too long".<BR> <BR>Well,the measure of what was optimal tankage-warriors with defensive up-just lost damage output. So monsters should also now "hit less hard".<BR> <BR>The other two I still think are up in the air. Your opinion may vary.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Okay..<P>1) Rangers can turn into a wolf, why can't we turn into a skeleton? I'm not asking for any special abilities, just to be able to cool look, and as a possible RP perspective.<P>2) I've been asking around and it seems that Shadow Knights and Paladins simply aren't wanted on raids because of their low damage output. You person even went as far as to say, "they aren't needed." Paladins don't get as much of a shaft simply because they can atleast LH. Maybe reducing the resist on HT would help a bit, atleast we'd have that.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just a note to you Iksar SK.<BR>Quit your *****in' about not being able to wear plate! Your AC bonus is a Bonus if you do something besides wear banded your entire career.<BR>Both I and a good RL friend have 45th lv SK.  I'm human he is Iksar.  He was getting pissed because he had such a low AC, so he did something about it.  He became a master smither and got a full suit of Cabilis scale (which is super easy compared to other 'racial' armours) after making that he went up to Imbued cabilis, got Dreadscale (which is worse) and a mix of Ry'gorr and Imbued.<BR>I have DF or better, Gaunts of the Black etc.  Neither of us are twinks.  I have a 765 AC (non buffed) in my plate.  He has over 870 nonbuffed in his chain.  You tell me that AC bonus doesn't matter.  But in ATK, I have a 894 unbuffed, and he has around 790.  And the regen does help.  after each battle (when we duo) I sit to med afterwards and He heals (dark Empathy) me because I get full mana and go pull and he is usually Full health by the time I get back.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Seriously, how do any of these changes benefit us high level sks especially with Velious is concerned?  Its simple, it doesnt.  Big deal, a new lifetap that doesnt work on any boss mob.  Diamondskin wow, i can absorb one of a quad 850 hit wohoo!  Grim Aura?  why even give this to us.  The Increase of Defense should have been that way since the start( <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif">onders rogues/monks having more ac than tank classes <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.  Now I welcome any changes to the class that will improve the class but none of this stuff effects the high level/end game SKs.  We are supposed to be 75%warrior 25% necro but its more like we are 25% warrior 25% necro 50%castertankingability. Where is the 75% as good version of Defensive?  You guys need to get rid of that crap leechcurse, its completely useless.  I wanna see a SK with 225 offense heal 5% of dmg than he receives on a boss mob before death.  You guys Verant need to give us sks/paladins a watered downed version of defensive.  That is the only way High level sks/paladins will ever be wanted at High end situations instead of being lookouts for respawns(which we still cant tank).  Give us a Defensive that lasts 75% as long, lowers dmg to us 75% as good, and reload time 75% longer than the warrior version of defensive.  Is that asking for so much?  We *WANT* to live for more than *3 seconds*<BR>at any encounter.  We are a tank right?  Ill trade all those changes on test just for that ONE CHANGE and every highend sk would agree.  Thanks for your time</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Okay...Like someone else said...Shadowknights are the masters of evil combat. Why is it that at level 19, I cant hit the broad side of a barn? I am absolutely sick and tired of whiffing with my sword 7+ times in a row on a croc that, because of drakness, is slowly sauntering away with its back to me. And pets? Theyre lucky at this level to get in a few damage. And if they git hit, its for full damage every time. Sure, my troll SK looks pretty menacing, but thats about it. Crocodiles laugh at me. My SK might as well be blind, he'd probably hit more often.<P>Hunkamunka<BR>19th Troll Shadowknight<BR>Vallon-Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

And all that other jive you just got , please .<BR>&lt;/An idiot wrote&gt;<P>Summon Corpse is a Level 51 spell for us, for a necromancer it is level 39, from levels 53-58 pretty much there are no raids, levels 52 and under you have Nagafen/Vox, 2 levels where we can use this spell as its intended (usefulness on raids) after that the raids we go on have necros with Conjure Corpse which is superior in every way to Summon Corpse, so much superior in fact that people dont even carry large coffins around (including myself... hell I dont even have one in my bank, and am bound far far away from where I can buy coffins)<BR>Lifetap's hmm... the lower level ones were being punished unfairly for a long time, thats just balancing not overpowering, our higher level taps have to long of a cast time to use... anything over 4 seconds really isnt useable for a Shadowknight.<BR>Were getting better pets? please show me where, Ill go buy them so my spellbook remains full.<BR>Pet buffs this is a joke spell, it will help very little, if I remember correctly its a level 29 spell, you do of course realise that with a shaman or enchanter around this spell is useless correct?  Of course I will use this while soloing but like I just said while SOLOING which is exactly what I shouldnt be doing... I see verants logic of giving us a buff, but I dont see the logic of making it help only in a solo setting, perhaps allow it to be a 10% stackable with any haste spell buff, which can go on group members pets?  That would make it group friendly which is what were trying to accomplish (well that and in a larger sense, contribute more than just lag to raids)<BR>And all that other jive you just got, what else did we get?  More defense? Useless for what we need.  No exp penality? Personally I would have prefered the penality was left in but it all went against the SK (even if that meant me losing a couple levels due to it... we would get power for our effort)<P>Judging from your post I would say your a warrior, please go back to your warrior thread and ask for bind/gate/more spells/ae attacks/more abilites/better gear some more, I swear you guys are idiots your so much better yet you dont even realise it and say other classes should be kept down so you maintain your superiority... /sigh</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor or whoever else might care what I have to say,<P>So far the changes are nice but miss what SK's are asking for... you've given us spells/abilites which increase our solo/small group abilites but nothing for the raid/end game situation, heres a few of the problems, and a couple solutions... there have been other excellent solutions than these as well in this thread, I suggest if you havent read it all (which I doubt you have simply due to how much you have to do) I strongly suggest you do read it.<P>Tanking at high levels- Heres a small excerpt of my log from the other yesterday when my guild killed Klandicar (btw fix his loot tables to be velious not kunark spells please)<P>[Sat Feb 03 20:38:32 2001] You have been summoned! <BR>[Sat Feb 03 20:38:32 2001] Klandicar claws YOU for 540 points of damage. <BR>[Sat Feb 03 20:38:32 2001] You can't see your target from here. <BR>[Sat Feb 03 20:38:34 2001] Klandicar claws YOU for 198 points of damage. <BR>[Sat Feb 03 20:38:34 2001] Klandicar claws YOU for 522 points of damage. <BR>[Sat Feb 03 20:38:35 2001] Klandicar claws YOU for 342 points of damage. <BR>[Sat Feb 03 20:38:35 2001] Klandicar goes on a RAMPAGE! <BR>[Sat Feb 03 20:38:35 2001] You are stunned! <BR>[Sat Feb 03 20:38:35 2001] Klandicar bashes YOU for 191 points of damage. <BR>[Sat Feb 03 20:38:37 2001] Klandicar claws YOU for 522 points of damage. <BR>[Sat Feb 03 20:38:37 2001] You are unstunned. <BR>[Sat Feb 03 20:38:39 2001] Klandicar claws YOU for 414 points of damage. <BR>[Sat Feb 03 20:38:39 2001] You have been slain by Klandicar! <BR>[Sat Feb 03 20:38:41 2001] Returning to home point, please wait... <BR>[Sat Feb 03 20:38:42 2001] LOADING, PLEASE WAIT... <P>Just slightly over 2700 damage taken in 7 seconds, we cant survive that... we cant even hope to (I was somewhere between 40 and 50 percent of my hp when he did this btw... dont think thats full hp-no hp).  Ways we can survive this type of punishment would be redoing leechcurse to heal more hp per dmg dealt and increasing its time to last longer maybe 90 seconds or something, as well as decreasing the refresh on it substantially so that we can use it to tank mobs.  The other way to allow us to tank would be to give us a form of the defensive discipline not the discipline itself but a form of it, perhaps 25-30% (make it based on lvl, 55 disc does 1% more reduction per lvl) damage reduction with the same reduction in damage output and a refresh faster than 72 minutes... thats to long for all sk disciplines (even unholyaura... it should be on the same recycle as ht...) say a 15 minute recycle at level 60?<P>Spell wise you could help us tank as well, Diamondskin is ok but that buff line tends to taunt mobs onto you to much, thus aggroing you dropping the skin and leaving you with less hp, dont get me wrong this spell will still have its uses but I dont think it's going to have the uses your expecting.  Maybe SK's could get Harmshield at level 59? (choosing this level although its to high simply because sk's get less than nothing that level).  Reasoning for this besides the obvious lack of defensive spells against uber mobs we have would be that SK's are a defensive class at later levels (start offensive, slowly move defensive) out of 64 spells curently (this number will change when changes on test go live) 42 (66%) of our spells are in fact defensive in nature (theres more to being a defensive spell than buffing yourself up people) 7 (11%) of our spells are pure utility spells, and 15 (23%) of our spells are offensive spells.  Harmshield is basically the ultimate defensive spell for us and fits into our self preservation trend very well (become immune let the others die and go find a nice spot to play dead)<P>Another problem with SK's even after the next patch will be our melee, the defensive increase will be great it's an extra 66 ac however, damage avoidence skills are still far to low, pre kunark our dodge/parry/riposte skills were 92% of that of a warriors, from levels 51 to 60 they slide to 82% of warriors, perhaps increase them so they remain at that 92% mark?<P>Next problem/solution: Summon Corpse.  Absor, you've stated before that this spell was to give SK's usefulness on raids, in my post previous to this one where I responded/flamed that other person I said that Summon Corpse isn't useful for the majority of the time an SK has it, this is entirley 100% true.  Until your out of the level range where you can kill Nagafen/Vox (2 levels) this spell is very useful, you can assist the necro with summoning bodies on failed raids, once your level 53 or higher though, there truly isnt much for a SK to do raid wise until level 58 or so and by then necromancers have Conjure Corpse which uses much much more convient coffins as its reagent, Im not going to suggest changing the reagent ours uses to small coffins as that would give us Conjure Corpse under a different name basically however the reagent for the sk version of Summon Corpse needs to be changed, just off the top of my head perhaps a 120pp stackable/fits in bags reagent could be used?  For Summon Corpse to be useable for us it needs to be convient, in its current state (im only suggesting changing the sk one, not the necro one) it isnt useful or in most cases even useable.<P>My last suggestion (for now) would be to give SK's the spells: Minor Shielding, Lesser Shielding, Shielding, Greater Shielding, Major Shielding, Arch Shielding.  Why?  Were the only class capable of casting which dosent have atleast one line of buffs, this could very possibly be that line of buffs.  Perhaps give them to us at the following levels?<BR>Minor Shielding-9<BR>Lesser Shielding-22<BR>Shielding-30<BR>Greater Shielding-39<BR>Major Shielding-51<BR>Arch Shielding-60<BR>There self only so it fits our selfish qualites, its a buff line, and I honestly cant see how this would be unbalancing since monks/sk's/paladins have access to Major Shielding through the Stave of Shielding and Blood Ember Brestplate already and all classes (I think, I know its all melee atleast though) have access to Arch Shielding through the hammer from Dain Frostreaver (ya i know, these abilites are given through uber mobs but the point remains there still given) how would this buff line unbalance us?

</FONT><HR>Brael's post is good<BR>I agree with it<BR>The spells we have still don't make us viable in a raid situation why not useful spells?<BR>Screaming Terror?<BR>Dark Pact?<BR>That spell that Necros give mana to other people.<BR>Harmshield<P>Those spells would give us the versitlity that verant says we are supposed to have. Without giving us the pet ability or the doting abilities of a necromancer. Now we have soul drain at 60 wow, can you look at Brael's logg? if he *tried* to cast that he might have just got it off and given himself an extra what? 400 hp? wow.. thats not the part you should look at though, IF Brael tried to cast soul drain do you actually think he wouldn't have gotten interrupted? The problem is that you guys say were tanks yet you give of these spells with super long casting times as if we stay back sit and med and dont get hit like a necromancer. It's that misconception that leads to the decrease in usefullness of most of our spells. Casting times are too long, or we get  interuppted too easily, and I think its both. Hey I know you like necromancers to be better than us in everyway when it comes to spell casting but hey I hate to break it to you, but casting a spell while getting hit is a SK's way of life, not a necro's, we need to be interuptted less or sometthing.  Do you sk's agree with me? if so please say so just curious if I am all alone here.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree, Shadowknights should be the master of fast casting spells.<P>Imagine this ingame senario...<P>High level necromancer has a high level spell he wishes to cast from his massive knowledge of spells and arcane lore. He knows its difficult to cast, so he steps far away from the fray so he won't be interrupted or have his concentration impared and then with great deliberation he calls his powers to the fore and which much arm waving, finger twiddling, and face pulling casts his high level spell.<P>The shadowknight on the other hand has only a handful of relatively low level spells to work with. She has cast them in battle many times and is adept with their uses and knowledgeable about how to cast them in battle. Despite the fact that she is not a necromancer but a fighter, the many battles she has fought in has taught her how to cast spells fast and effectively, and so with battle raging all around her she pulls some of her concentration away from her swordplay and with an economic single hand gesture quickly casts a low level spell to drain some life from the mob she is currently engaged in fighting.<P>Sounds pretty feasible to me.<P>Cheers,<BR>Tryst<BR>Lv50 Darkelven lady Shadowknight</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Things that are good about Shadow knights are numerous, also things that can be "tweaked" to make us better are also numerous, I will try to outline both! <P>We are a fantastic mix of melee / caster, better than any other Hybrid.<P>We can use the most basic of spells to protect ourselves and our group members,  some of those being:<P>Level 9<BR>&gt;<BR>Disease Cloud, is one of the best alternative methods of taunting a MOB that we could ask for, it's fast to cast, long range, and uses little mana, all in all its a GREAT asset to us, I am proud to have it in our arsenal of spells!<BR>(Keep it, leave it alone)<BR>&gt;<BR>Locate corpse, is a great "Utility" spell to have, fast to cast, long range, uses little mana very easy to use, can be a "life saver" for young and old alike, especially useful for those whom go link-dead often.<BR>(Keep it, leave it alone)<BR>&gt;<BR>Siphon strength, is one of our favorite MOB debuff / selfbuff, fast to cast, long range, uses little mana, granted the amount it returns to us in STR is hardly worth having it at higher LvL's. Still we all use this as often as we can; it adds that "little extra" on top of STR buffs from other classes.<BR>(Keep, improve it with  "one point more STR per season, after season 20")<BR>&gt;<BR>Sense the dead, not much of a use for it, unless you’re looking for the undead Cyclops in South Karana. Almost a waist of a spell-book slot.<BR>(Keep for the heck of it, might be worth it someday, maybe /giggle)<BR>&gt;<BR>Leering corpse, Our first taste of having a little "companion", using the term "pet" here would just be an insult to pet's everywhere. We get our much-needed lessons in proper pet usage, and can become comfortable with issuing  "companion commands". Without consequence if he die's unlike other casters pets, where normally if pet dies the caster is soon to follow...<BR>(keep, its a great learning tool)<BR>&gt;<BR>Life tap, our first spell that make's little use of our mana, granted its like a 5 point DD, and it does give the Hit Points to us, but the mana expenditure is so out-of-whack, that its basically a hindrance to "downtime" to cast it. <BR>(Keep, but IMPROVE it with either more hp taken and returned to us and less mana needed to cast)<BR>&gt;<BR>Invisibility to undead is a nice "utility" spell and has it uses at ALL character LvL's.<BR>(keep, no change)<BR>&gt;<BR>Level 15<BR>&gt;<BR>Bone walk, /sigh. I now get a "one hit wonder", again it CANNOT be called a pet, because "one hit from a MOB and you wonder where your pet went", I.E. its dead. Of course our "pets" are not melee tanks like casters pets. They are just additional damage dealers while we are tanking. <BR>(Keep, but give it more hp, to make it more than just a Yield sign and more like a speed bump for MOB's, when we are forced to retreat or zone)<BR>&gt;<BR>Clinging darkness, all I can say is FANTASTIC, I still use it at my LVL because its MANA EFFICENT, granted at my LvL I should be using dooming darkness, but that just takes too much mana to cast :-( <BR>(Keep, leave it alone)<BR>&gt;<BR>Endure cold, really its only purpose, it’s to train in the "skill", because it’s the same one that you need for feign death. :-)<BR>(Keep it, leave it alone)<BR>&gt;<BR>Fear, a BASIC spell, to this day I still have it Memorized because Invoke Fear uses too much mana.<BR>(Keep it, leave it a lone)<BR>&gt;<BR>Life spike, something that finally heals a little of my health at least for another season or three, and is basically worth having/casting, though the mana cost is still a bit prohibitive.<BR>(Keep, lower mana cost, increase to 15 hp)<BR>&gt;<BR>Numb the dead, at best an okay utility spell, it has its uses...<BR>(Keep it, no change)<BR>&gt;<BR>Shadow step, A spell that has wonderful potential! The COMPLETE randomness makes it almost worthless, but it has its uses. <BR>(Keep it, but make the port a minimum of out of "normal" aggro range, and IN the direction you are facing) <BR>&gt;<BR>Level 22<BR>Convoke shadow, Finally something I can call a PET, as long as I am fighting GREEN MOB's! It cant even hit blue MOB's most of the time and when he does its for 3 to 6 hp average, using fine steel.<BR>(Keep improve its offensive skills, and hitpoints)<BR>&gt;<BR>Dark empathy, great to have, has its uses even at LvL 49 I use it at times, does need to be increased after season 30 or its basically worthless, unless your power leveling someone’s character from season 1-6.<BR>(Keep increase a point a level after 30 till 50)<BR>&gt;<BR>Deadeye, GREAT utility spell<BR>(Keep it, no change)<BR>&gt;<BR>Engulfing darkness, Too much mana is needed! When compared to clinging, the benefit of the increase of damage and slow, does not justify its usage over clinging.<BR>(Delete it! or fix it via less mana needed and more damage/slow when cast.)<BR>&gt;<BR>Spook the dead, works as intended /giggle<BR>(Keep it, no change)<BR>&gt;<BR>Vampiric embrace, UN-BUG THIS SPELL!!, as a lower LvL I loved this spell and it proc'ed fairly often, a few times a fight. At LVL 49 with the same weapon and more DEX, it proc's only a few times in a DAY!<BR>(Keep, improve the "rate of lifetap increase X Lvl" to an extra point for every season, OR increase it's "number" of proc's X your LVL.)<BR>&gt;<BR>Ward undead, why bother using it, the DD is nice but not mana feasible, for the little damage it does.<BR>(Delete it or MAJOR fix, I can do 10X the damage in melees in the time it takes to cast the spell.)<BR>&gt;<BR>Level 30<BR>Endure disease, I like it, its useful, has potential.<BR>(Keep but upgrade it to Resist disease, and give us resists cold at Lvl 30!)<BR>&gt;<BR>Feign Death, My all time FAVORTIE spell, This is one of the three spells at 30 that change the life of an SK forever. Granted after 35 I mostly like it because an Ogre looks so funny when they FD! :-)<BR>A true blue life saver, but its just a tinny tiny touch too SLOW, just a matter of a second or so, with more than one mob you can almost never get it to work, caster MOBS are a another story and need NOT to be descused here.<BR>(KEEP IT!, speed it up just a second or so :-))<BR>&gt;<BR>Gather shadows, great Utility spell, the second spell at 30 that’s a "life" changer.<BR>(Keep it, longer effect time, maybe? or not I like it the way it is)<BR>&gt;<BR>Heat blood, good potential, nice to have, I like it, but in general the amount of damage it does to a MOB at 30 makes it almost worthless to use.<BR>(Keep it, give it to us earlier or increase its damage a bit)<BR>&gt;<BR>Life draw, What can I say, its the third spell at 30 that is a "life" changer for an SK, its GREAT. After 38 its mana versus hit point return makes it usable but almost not worth casting (granted the melee/cast delay change has improved the use of this spell greatly).<BR>(Keep it, lower cast time, or increase-hit point draw-return X 1 per every season.)   <BR>&gt;<BR>Restless Bones, a "pet" I guess...see other "pets"<BR>(Keep it improve like all other "pets for SK")<BR>&gt;<BR>Wave of enfeeblement, Not too bad, very nice debuff!<BR>(Keep it, no real change needed)<BR>&gt;<BR>Level 39<BR>&gt;<BR>Animate dead, See other pets<BR>(Keep it, improve HP, attack)<BR>&gt;<BR>Cancel magic, GREAT utility spell<BR>(Keep it, no change)<BR>&gt;<BR>Expulse undead, worthless 94 damage for that mana usage and casting time!!, I can do way more in Melee "see Ward Undead", <BR>(Delete it, or major fix, like undead ONLY DD and life tap, and LOWER casting time, mana usage)<BR>&gt;<BR>Resist cold, I like it, but...<BR>(Keep it, but give it to us at 30, see endure disease)<BR>&gt;<BR>Shadow Vortex, LOVE IT, GREAT DEBUFF, BUFF<BR>(Keep it, no change)<BR>&gt;<BR>Shrowd of hate, LOVE IT, GREAT DEBUFF, BUFF<BR>(Keep it, no change)<BR>&gt;<BR>Shield skin, HAS POTENTIAL, BUT worthless at 39!<BR>Needs major work, more protection needed.<BR>(Keep it, give it to us sooner, or major fix like a "duration of spell" absorption, for each melee hit from a MOB the first 27-55 hit points of that hit is absorbed for 10 rounds, the remainder of the hit is the damage to the SK)<BR>&gt;<BR>LvL 49<BR>&gt;<BR>Breath of the dead, GREAT utility spell! But give us something-shadow knight specific...<BR>(Keep tweak it up as a season 49 reward spell, like combining underwater breathing with a levitation spell I.E. dead man falling without the poison resist, using two spell reagents, fish scales, AND bat wings. call it "Presence of the banshee")<BR>&gt;<BR>Dismiss undead, have potential for something, as long as it a life tap too...<BR>(Delete or MAJOR work, see ward undead/expulse undead)<BR>&gt;<BR>Dooming darkness, Great spell, almost perfect for us, but mana requirement is a bit too high, for mana poor SK :-(<BR>(Keep it, need to use a touch less mana to cast)<BR>&gt;<BR>Invoke Fear, Another Great spell, but again it take just to much mana for a simply Melee'n SK<BR>(Keep it, need to use less mana to cast it)<BR>&gt;<BR>Life Leach, AWESOME Potential spell, being 49 I cant quest for it till LvL 50, that’s really STUPID!!! It does look to be a fun quest, but the Mana cost, and recast time is WAY-OUT-OF-WACK for the number of hitpoints I have at the LvL. Dont get me wrong 280 heal is nice, but that will only heal me about 2/3 of a health bubble. For the mana that’s needed to cast, I can only get it off about twice with full mana, that means I only recover 1 and 1/3  bubbles of hit points for my entire mana pool, not to mention 2 minutes to recast! YUCKY!<BR>(KEEP IT, lessen mana needed, and recast time by a TON!, it is a quest spell so that would make it worth doing/using .. :-))<BR>&gt;<BR>Shadow Sight, great utility spell<BR>(Keep it, no change, unless maybe castable onto other players)<BR>&gt;<BR>Summon dead, WOOT a dual wielding PET, yes I said it PET :-), they can dual wield so I wont complain about the fact that three hits from a hill giant and they are dead.<BR>(Keep it, more hit points and attack for our PET, not a lot, but just enough to have him last more than a minute)<BR>/<BR>Word of spirit, great potential. Only thing I would want that would make it GREAT is a hit point tap to the SK from every MOB that’s is hit for the 104 damage that this spells casts. Example : 4 MOBS x 104 = 416 damage...SK absorbs 416 hit points, increase mana consumption to a good 500 mana needed to cast, and I would sing your praises all year long!<BR>(keep it, see text for upgrading it)<BR>&gt;<BR>LvL 51-siphon life, in stead of 75 hit points it should be 150 hit point tap for 75 mana.<BR> (MOBS Hit for way more than 75 hp at that lvl, making a tap for 75 futile!)<BR>&gt;<BR>Lvl 53 Boil Blood is given to us way to late in our lives, big deal a 500 DOT on a LvL 53 MOB, LMAO.<BR>(Keep it, but give it to us as a "token" spell at 50)<BR>&gt;<BR>LvL 54 banshee aura, /sigh yet another useful spell given too late to be of any use.<BR>(Keep it, give it to us at 49)<BR>&gt;<BR>LvL 55 Bobbing corpse, Nice idea with the increase of resist poison, but...give us a version of it at 49, "see breath of the dead, Presence of the banshee", and upgrade this version with the addition of a NICE magic resist.<BR>(Keep it, give us a version sooner and tweak Bobbing up with good magic resist)<BR>&gt;<BR>Expel undead /SIGH too little too late, has no real purpose for us at this LvL.<BR>(Delete it, or MAJOR fix, see ward undead, etc etc.)<BR>&gt;<BR>Shroud of death, GREAT spell, as long as it will proc every few seconds, otherwise it really wont have much of an effect when fighting MOBS at this lvl...<BR>(Keep it, improve number of procs in relation to number of ticks, a proc a tick would be nice :-))<BR>&gt;<BR>LvL 56 <BR>Spirit tap, great potential, LOL one second longer casting time than siphon life!<BR>Cast siphon life 4 times you get 300 hp recovered spell time was 12.4 seconds. Now if you cast Spirit tap 3 times, = 12 seconds you get 450 hit point recovered.<BR>&gt;<BR>Not a big change from season 51 to 56, especially since the mana cost is about equal. Mana into hit points (about one to one ratio). <BR>&gt;<BR>The MOBS are hitting you once for what it takes 12 seconds to recover in a tap. Not to mention at 49 you get a 280 tap for 315 mana that only takes 2.5 seconds to cast, granted its recast time is 2 minutes :-(<BR>(Keep it, tweak it a LOT)<BR>&gt;<BR>LvL 57, Great spell, great way to "tap" a mob for some <BR>"Free hit points" just before they die :-)<BR>(Keep it, no change, unless given early in LvL)<BR>&gt;<BR>LvL 60<BR>Asystole, Great potential for a 60 SK, just give the debuffs to US, like with shrowd of hate, and strength tap, shadow vortex, :-)<BR>(Keep it, but its insulting for a LVL 60 of the hardest race to LVL, give the debuffed stat's to the SK caster, then, and only then well we see our true potential :-))<BR>&gt;<BR>Death peace, Great Spell, but too little too late, bring casting time to 1/2 a second, COME ON we earned it!!!<BR>(Keep it, lower casting time to 1/2 second)<BR>&gt;<BR>Drain spirit; Come on give us a decent life tap!<BR>We have earned it, all those extra EXP we had to get all this time, specially SK ogres, and troll's of course :-), <BR>(Keep it, lessen casting time to 2 seconds, increase to 500 tap, and increase mana used to 200.)<BR>&gt;<BR>I have skipped a few of the 50+ spells, due to the fact that they wont really hurt or help us and my post has become extremely long :-) <BR>&gt;<BR>NOW ON TO descipline’s: <BR>&gt;<BR>LvL 51<BR>THE DISCIPLINE OF RESISTANT, /sigh Nice Idea, 10+ to each, that really a bit low :-( <BR>(Keep it, at least +15 per would be nice)<BR>&gt;<BR>LvL 54<BR>THE DISCIPLINE OF FEARLESS, Great Idea, but what's this good for??, nothing.... 11 seconds?? Awe come on<BR>(11 seconds, it takes em half that long just to cast fear... increase time limit)<BR>&gt;<BR>LvL55 <BR> THE DISCIPLINE OF UNHOLY AURA, GOOD EFFORT, but Harm touch is still way under-powered; this increase does not do much to help it.<BR>(Keep it, great try, and I appreciate it, so I think I will just take it and shut up :-))<BR>&gt;<BR>LVL 60<BR>THE DISCIPLINE OF LEECHCURSE, WOOT!!, still we are talking 60 here, the End-All, Be-All, why not add harmtouch damage to this??? Its not like you can use this AND the UNHOLY AURA at the same time. :-)<BR>(Keep it, add our harm-touch damage into the Melee calculator, so we get that HT damage back as hit points)<BR>&gt; <BR> &gt;<BR>&gt;<BR>Okay last few items ,going on...<BR>&gt;<BR>DUAL WEILD for Shadow Knights, NO do NOT do it. Never, ever do that; leave dual to the warriors, rangers and who ever else want it, but not US!<BR>&gt;<BR>Increase our Offensive mainly, and defensive a little. Those skill CAPs are TOO LOW, we need it, its not like we are nukers or healers, and we cannot out damage a warrior, so at least let us put out some more damage, and be able to take few hits to...<BR>&gt;<BR>Increase Dodge and parry skills aswel, all melee and hybrids need some increases to the CAP, the CAP is just to low...we are in the "thick of it" and get beat on,...give us some "innate" protection at higher LvL's.<BR>&gt;<BR>Increase our weapons skill CAPS, come one I can get a kick-butt sword as my epic but because of the CAPS I'll never see its true potential, that’s NOT FAIR <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>&gt;<BR>Increase bind wound ability, lol it takes me 25 bandages to get to half-life :-(((.<BR>&gt;<BR>Okay I think I'm done all.<BR>&gt;<BR>I am very happy with the changes that have taken place recently. <BR>&gt;<BR>I make these suggestions to "tweak" the shadow knights into everything that they should be, its all constructive criticism, I know 10's of thousands of man-hours have gone into the classes, and I am just giving you the polishing up that the shadow knight needs, to be a great class. <BR>&gt;<BR>(No "Ill will" is held against you, from me, as an SK Ogre having to endure so much heartache, trying to get so much more experience to LVL than other classes/ races,  so just remember that when you make these positive change for us :-)<BR>&gt;<BR>/salute<BR>/bow<BR>/kneel<BR>/wave<BR>&gt;<BR>Exuo<BR>&gt;<BR>Season 49 Shadow knight Ogre<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I recently saw a discription of the SK changes made on the test server and i must applaud verant for actually proposing some of these<BR>IE: Grim aura at 22 (finally)<P>    Shieldskin to 34 (needs to be 30 and put leatherskin at 39  dunno why it was skipped  you went straight to steelskin)<P>    Maxing defensive caps to MATCH warriors (WOOT!<BR>even after someone *cough cough* said this was Very unlikely to happen,after all cant you wear plate?) <P>    Lowering,as someone has stated,*artificially* inflated mana cost on pre Lvl 50 lifetaps<P>These enhancements are well recieved, BUT that is all they are.....enhancements.  It seems verant has yet to hit their actual target, BALANCE.<BR>In my opinion the only way to check an SK's balance is to look at its mirror class, the paladin. The paladin class is WAY overpowered in the way of Spells (although equal in offense and defense caps). Paladins get a Better than complete heal in Lay Hands--Sk's dont even get half of that dmg in Harm Touch. At lvl 39 paladins get a 300hp heal spell(lvl 24 cleric spell), SK's get a 45 hp tap at 30 (necro 12 spell) and dont get ANOTHER Tap line spell til 51! which is a staggering overpowered (notice sarcasm) 75hp tap ( necro 20 spell) that is a 31 lvl difference!? Whereas the Paladin/Cleric greater heal is only a 15 lvl difference. <BR>Suggestions:<BR>Move 75hp tap to 39<BR>Move 150hp tap to 49<BR>Move quested life leech spell to 50 or 51 (because this is useless at 49, the quest NPC wont even give you the quest til 50!!!!!)<BR>Give HT a 25% boost after lvl 10<BR>Give us a full blown DMF ie. castable on others (for raids purposes)<BR>How about a Grim Aura upgrade at 49 with a Skeleton Illusion (we can already invis to undead and rangers get wolf form at 49....Pleads....<P>I hope my suggestions havent been in vain...they are only suggestions, but i hope if nothing else verant sees that Balancing is the key...not minor tweaks to appease the masses. (oh btw   you gave paladins a 110 hp per 4 tick heal spell....that is REALLY balanced)  ROFL</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I hope that you still monitor this thread Absor, I just wanted to throw my 2 cents into this thread.  Currently, I play a level 24 Dark Elf SK on Tarew Marr as my main.  I will not presume to know a lot about the class, as I am still really in my infancy as playing as a SK.  Therefore, I will be concentrating on what you can do to possibly help the lower leveled SKs out there and let the veteran SKs make their own suggestions about the balancing of the game for the higher levels.  I would also like to say that in no way am I speaking for the entire SK community below 30, the things I will present here are just things I'd like to see.  First off though, I must applaud you on the many changes you've made to the class already, namely, the removal of the exp penalty.  I must also applaud you on the changes being made to SKs on the test server that will hopefully make it into the game, well done.  Secondly, I apologize if any of the suggestions I'm about to make have been suggested previously in this thread.  I was out of town for a bit and missed most of these threads, and really don't have the time to go through all the suggestions.  I also apologize if I get some of the spell information wrong.  Now, for my suggestions:<BR>1. Move Gather Shadows down to 22, or 15.  Many people before me have asked for this, and I have to agree with them.  It seems this spell will have come too late when I finally receive it in a few levels.  As it is right now, I would have little use for it.  It would have been much more useful for me when I was darting through High Pass to avoid the guards and townsfolk on my way to the Karanas, or when I had to book it past the monks in Freeport.  As it is now, I've improved my faction with these places so much that I don't need to be invisible to move through them.<BR>2.  Vampiric Embrace.  If you will not totally un-nerf it, how about a compromise?  Change its formula to (level)+1 or change it so that it will go off more.  As it is now, it is a pretty worthless lifetap.  It rarely goes off for me, perhaps once or twice in a fight.  I could've use that thirty mana on Lifespike and gotten more life back.  I hope I don't upset many of my SK bretherin with this next statement, but why not ditch vampiric embrace completely and give us a 25-30 point lifetap that costs around 30 mana?  I might be wrong about its usefullness, but I really can't picture too many higher leveled SKs with this spell still in a slot.  Maybe you could give vampiric embrace back at a later level (39 probably, since I don't think we get a new lifetap at that level) with its necro formula in place instead of the current one, or maybe with the formula (level)*2.5+1, or even(level)*3+1.<BR>3.  Evocation and abjuration.  As someone else suggested, why not give us two small placeholder spells for evocation and abjuration at level 9?  Maybe a small DD evocation spell that does around 10-20 damage to the undead for 10 or 15 mana?  Heck, I wouldn't care if it did 2 damage, evocation at a lower level would've been nice to have.  It's very frustrating right now to have to train Evocation up to 125 from 0 with a spell that consumes 30 mana when it is successful.  For an abjuration spell, eh, I didn't mind that as much.  It seemed to fizzle less, if I remember correctly, and I was able to get it up much faster.  You could perhaps give us a small resist poison abjuration spell that adds 5 or 10 to sv poison?  I know that when I was hunting around the commonlands at this level range, I often wouldn't bother to engage snakes because most times, the poison would kill me.  With a small boost of resist poison, I would think that many lower leveled SKs would act more daring.<BR>4.  Our pets.  As some other players suggested, why not make our pets somewhat stronger?  If not, how about lowering the cost to 1 bone chip until the 49th level pet?  The price of bone chips is rising these days, and I really don't consider 10 of my pets to be worth 5pp.  Going off on another tangent of pets, perhaps you could make ours different from the necro pets in some way, maybe be giving them either higher HP or damage?  I'd have to lean towards higher damage myself, I'd rather see them hitting for some good damage when they actually hit.  How about giving us our own special kind of pet, perhaps in the form of a ghoul, a mob I have always associated with the SK after first seeing them stand guard in front of my guild in Neriak.  They could be summoned by using a type of flesh, waterlogged, rotting, or otherwise?  Perhaps the flesh could be sold in our guild?  This ghoul pet could have the same stats as the regular skellie pet, but it could be allowed to cast a disease spell on the target.  I see many SKs around my level still pulling mobs with disease cloud.  If the ghoul could cast that for us, it would free up a spell slot, and would actually make me feel as if my pet actually contributed something to the fight.  I know that last idea is kind of impossible to implement, but, hey, a guy can dream  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>Those are my suggestions, do with them what you will.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There is one thing I do not understand about the weapon/offence/defence skill caps. Why can a ranger at level 20 have the same max skills as a warrior (for the skills they share) yet not have the same skills at level 50?  I know this is SK discussion, not ranger, but I think the problem is true of all the hybrid classes.  The offence/defence/weapon skills should all be equal to the warriors, regardless of the level.  The other skills that the hybrid gives up in exchange for the spells should be the balancing factor, as well as the HP.  Other skills, well, I don't see why the pally/sk (trained knights for crying out loud) cannot parry as well as a warrior, or riposte.  That is, why they have an artificial cap on their growth as compared to the warrior.  A level 30 Pally/SK has the same (level+1)*5 caps as a warrior, so why not have the same thing hold true past level 40?  I can understand a skill, such as kick, that the warrior would not have the highest level in, and the hybrids that have the skill should not have it greater than the warrior, but the skills htat the hybrid shares with the warrior should have the same skill caps as the warrior.  Just let the warrior have the better HP, as well as all the skills the hybrid gave up in exchange for spells, that in combination with the better warrior only items will keep the warrior king of the tanks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I really see only a few issues with Hybrids in general and with shadowknights specifically:<P>1. If a warrior has 100% more AC (AC rating is exponential instead of linear at higher levels), 100% better at defense (again, exponential), and has 300% more hit points than a hybrid (say Shadowknights for example), then the warrior is 500% better at tanking than a shadowknight. Let's have this re-evaluated and determine how much better warriors are supposed to be than hybrids, or check how much worse hybrids are supposed to be (1/5?).<P>2. Criticals - I think that all classes that would melee as a primary form of doing damage (fighter classes and hybrids - including bards) should have the ability to inflict critical hits. Warriors of course are best at this as they have critical hits during normal combat and crippling blows using disciplines and when they're low on HP. They also can perform a critical hit with any of their attacks (except bows?). Rangers already have crits on their bows (which would indicate that rangers should not be in there meleeing so much, but using their bows more often - but that's for them to figure out), Monks receive special attacks like flying kick and others, Rogues receive backstab.<BR> <BR>Shadowknights and Paladins should receive the ability to inflict critical hits with bash - with a shield and special 2hs(epic and dark reaver or some other less common sword). Maybe it's only from behind a creature, or only from the front, or when they're fleeing, or not fleeing. Any way, crits would be useful as they would figure out the best way to attack. <P>Bards should receive the ability to do critical hits only with a secondary weapon or their epic weapon. This again can be from various angles, or only in certain situations in combat, as bards would adapt their roles to be able to inflict crits.<P>Caster/Priests should not receive criticals as they inflict most of their damage/healing with spells.<P>3. Spells: The direction that I see shadowknights spells pointed towards seems to be toward sucking or leeching types of spells.(lifetap, siphon strenght, leechcurse, etc.) However, there are many spells that do not receive upgrades at all or until post-50. Some examples are disease cloud and vampiric embrace (improve at 39?). <P>Thanks for asking and thanks for your attention in this matter.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Brael's post is good<BR>I agree with it<BR>The spells we have still don't make us viable in a raid situation why not useful spells?<BR>Screaming Terror?<BR>Dark Pact?<BR>That spell that Necros give mana to other people.<BR>Harmshield<BR>Those spells would give us the versitlity that verant says we are supposed to have. Without giving us the pet ability or the doting abilities of a necromancer. Now we have soul drain at 60 wow, can you look at Brael's logg? if he *tried* to cast that he might have just got it off and given himself an extra what? 400 hp? wow.. thats not the part you should look at though, IF Brael tried to cast soul drain do you actually think he wouldn't have gotten interrupted? The problem is that you guys say were tanks yet you give of these spells with super long casting times as if we stay back sit and med and dont get hit like a necromancer. It's that misconception that leads to the decrease in usefullness of most of our spells. Casting times are too long, or we get interuppted too easily, and I think its both. Hey I know you like necromancers to be better than us in everyway when it comes to spell casting but hey I hate to break it to you, but casting a spell while getting hit is a SK's way of life, not a necro's, we need to be interuptted less or sometthing. Do you sk's agree with me? if so please say so just curious if I am all alone here.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Recast time 30 secs.<BR>g) Defense skill cap made exactly same as warriors<BR>5) Shadowknights:<BR>a) Remove artificially inflated mana cost for pre level 50 lifetap spells<BR>b) Move Spirit Tap to level 55<BR>c) Move Drain Spirit to level 57<BR>d) Add Drain Soul at level 60<BR>e) Grim Aura added at level 22<BR>f) Move Shieldskin to level 34<BR>g) Mini Intensify Death pet buff added at 29, 10% (min) haste 5 str 5 ac<BR>h) Add Diamondskin spell at 59<BR>i) Defense skill cap made exactly same as warriors<BR>6) Rangers:<BR>a) Add Endure Cold at 22<BR>b) Add Skin Like Nature at 59<BR>c) Add FireFist at 22<BR>d) Move Bramblecoat from 49 to 39<BR>e) Add Spikecoat at 49<BR>f) Add resist cold at 55<BR>g) Add Panic Animal at 22<BR>i) Offense and weapons skill made identical to warriors<BR>7) Bards:<BR>a) Cassindra`s Chant of Clarity for Bards at level 20<BR>b) Bards defensive skill made exactly the same as a warriors<BR>8) Magicians:<BR>a) New level 59 spell, Valiant Companion, makes pet immune to fear (own pet only)<BR>b) New level 39 spell, Summon Companion, if pet not noticed by any hostile npcs, pet returns to you instantly.<BR>c) Rain spells no longer count pets against total number of entities they can damage (all rain spells)<BR>d) Expedience for Mages at level 29. Target casters pet, J Boot speed buff for pet only<BR>9) Warriors:<BR>a) Aggressive and Defensive disciplines fixed before they would only affect damage taken and not affect damage dealt out. Now they affect both as designed.<BR>10) New Scrolls are temporarily avaiable in East Commons&gt;&gt;&gt;<P>As you can see, they look very promising, and with the exception of the proposed bashing enhancement, we got much of what we asked for.<BR>I can only hope that these changes are deemed apropiate and aplied to the rest of the servers.<P>Whith that said, I'd like to suggest a posible course of action to address the many concerns about the epic weapon "Innoruks Curse". As we all know, a sizable portion of the SK population is small/medium, so we use the shield and 1h to make up for the lack slam.<P>I propose that this weapon be given an effect similar to the War's epic "Jagged Blade of War". This weapon breaks down into two 1hs -blades of tactics and strategy. This is an elegant solution to the 1h/2h debate, so I propose that Innorok's Curse break down into a shield and a 1h. Both the shield and the 1 hander should give stats and proc. The shield's proc should be an enhanced stun, this way, all those requests for better bashing at the uberaids would be addressed with minimum impact to the class in general. The 1 hander should proc either a stamina or agility buff-more HP or AC, precicely what we need to fulfill our damage absorving role. Lastly, while this request has nothing to do with game mechanics, I'd like to see better visuals on the weapon itself. I propose that, since SK are antipaladins, and since Palis have three flaming swords available to them (last time I checked), that our epic weapon be given some kind of mist swirl or something along those lines. This simple enhancement will greatly increase the prestige of completing the quest, and that in turn will make the sheer difficulty of obtaining it more palatable.<P>I woudl like to thank Absor and the VI team for addressing SK deficiencies and game balance in general. IMHO your willingness to even tackle such a momentous job as this does you credit.

</FONT><HR>*<BR>**<BR>The only really usefull change they made to high level SKs is increasing defense.  The pet buff is pretty worthless, grim aura is pretty minor.  Skin line is decent, but not going to be used much.  The lifetaps under 50 are so small that they're just about pointless, no matter what the mana cost.<P>Why not decrease the cast time of post 50 lifetaps?  We still pay high mana cost, but because of the cast time, there's no way we'd use this midbattle. We can dish out (and take) much more damage than a tap will do.<P>I agree, summon corpse is a bone.  An average SK *might* carry one coffin around to help him if his corpse gets lost.  But that's about it.  Maybe if our coffins were stackable, but still more expensive, that might make it worthwhile.<BR>**<BR>*<P>Ah well, thanks for attempting to address our concerns.  <P>Buli<BR>55 ogre sk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have played a Troll SK on Rallos Zek since Beta.  I am now 55 (almost 56) and have seen the evolution of this class.  I will comment now on mostly the spells.  Simply put, I would like to see the spells revolve around the theme of Desiease, Darkness, and dots.  I suppose I could post a whole sugested spell list but ill try and keep it short and sweet.  <BR> First off please do away with all of our lifetap spells (siphon life, lifedraw, etc) except our 49 quest lifetap lifeleeach.  I do not think they are apropriate for the SK on the grounds that we should be doing more tanking and less casting in combat.  Leave them to the necro.  I would sugest a upgrade to lifeleeach (quest spell) at level 60.<BR>  I would then remove the whole Heat Blood line that we get.  A heat based dot has nothing to do with a SK who gets cold buffs and worships gods of fear and decay.  I would also remove our rune type spells (shieldskin), they too are not practical for the tank SK.<BR>  To replace these three lines, I suggest the following three lines:<BR>  To replace the lifetap.. i propse the lifetap dots.  They could be cast before or during combat and work for us to give us back a stream of hps during the fight.. adding to our tankage yet not getting in our way as shieldskin and lifetap chain casting does.  This line also fits well with our dot/vampire theme!  I would say Leeach at 30, Vampiric curse at 51 and Bond of Death at 60.<BR>   To Replace the heat blood line I would add to our Desiease line.  We get Desiease Cloud at level one and its a great spell.  Seeing how one of the SK gods is master of decay why do we not get more in this line?  I suggest Infectious Cloud at level 30 (to replace heat blood) and Scourge at level 53 or so (to replace boil blood)  This would not imbalance our power at all, but would add greatly to our theme as warriors of darkness and decay.<BR>    Lastly to replace our shieldskin line and to replace the early lifetaps we get at level 9 and 15, I suggest we be given the shielding spells line (minor shielding, etc).  This would give us a useful buff instead of a shieldskin we hate to use cause of cost and weariness of recasting it. <P>   As a level 55 old school SK, I think the above three changes in spell lines would be very good for the SK population.  The lifetap dots and minor shielding line would give us much needed tanking ability by utilizing appropriate necromancer spells.  The replacement of heat blood line with desiease line is for roleplaying reasons, but would make many SK's (esspecialy SK's of Bertoxolus) happy without changing our power.  It would streamline our spell lines and get rid of alot of spells that make no sense in our aresnal.<P>  As for the warrior aspect of us and our ability to tank ubermobs.. I think a slight upgrade to our meele skills is in order (especialy defense) and Leeachcurse needs to be modified somewhat to result in about the same effect as Defensive or so.  Ill leave the details of all that to the SK's whom are concerned with the warrior aspects of us, I am much more interested in seeing our spell lines streamlined and made useful.<P> So to recap.. switch lifetaps for lifetap DoTs.<BR> Switch heat blood line with Desiease line.<BR> Switch shieldskin line with Minor Shielding line.<BR> <BR>        Lots more ideas..but I want people to come away from my post with the above three spell line suguestion changes.<BR>   <P>       Yours in Darkness,<BR>                Locnar Thaumaturgus 55 TSK of RZ</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A few things<P><BR>-BASH  <P>Please o please do something with our bash skill. This is the skill that could give Paladins and SK's something unique about them in combat. At the very least our skill cap needs to raised by a signifigant margin. And as has been stated before, we would really like to see some more unique shields and some with procing effects.<P><BR>- Where are the good Velios weapons? My guild is farming tons of amazing weapons for wariors and rogues. I have yet to see a weapon that I, as an SK, would use. Even the SK specific drops off of the ubermobs (yelinek, klandicar, etc.) are not very good. Specifically we would really like to see some more good one handers. Right now SK's pretty much have two options for premium performance at 55-60 : The Ebon Mace and the Epic weapon, and there are even dual weildable warior/rogue weapons that outperform the ebon mace.<P><BR>-Epic weapon. Aside from the issues about some of the items required in this quest (soul leech, blade of abrogation) that require massive guild raids into the planes to get rare/god drops, there is the issue of it being two handed. Like the Paladins, we would really like to see an epic one hander/shield combo. Possibly even an extension of the IC quest that could give us the option of weilding it as a two hander or spliting it into a sword/shield.<P>-cast times on high level spells. I like the things you have done with our spells on test, however, we don't use spells such as cascading darkness because of the insane casting times. Remember, we are up front  toe to toe fighters, anything with a cast time of over 4 seconds is pretty much going to be impossible for us to get off. The new spell 'drain soul' looks very nice as far as the amount of damage/healing it does, but I see the cast time as a major problem. How about retooling the post 50 lifetap line so that we get upgrades to lifeleech (SK specific lifetaps) rather than necro lifetaps? This is just an idea however, the present lifetap configuration ontest might work out better than I think.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just one thing to add today (yes I just make a post daily about stuff that might be nice to have)<BR>252 bash skill, along with the ability for sk's and paladins ONLY to have the ability to interrupt lvl 55+ mobs.  And we still need harmshield, the shielding line, and a rebalancing of leechcurse (explained why in my pervious post).<P>Also I dont know if this is intended or something you can fix or what but the shieldskin/steelskin/diamondskin line taunts a TON casting these spells after I maybe lose it against an uber mob from ae's or ripostes or whatever, I will actually end up taunting the mob onto me by putting the skin back up, this makes it basically a one shot thing against a major mob, in which case rune 5 is better to do as it will absorb 200 hp more,</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>After seeing what the goal for SK's is (to be on the defensive) and seeing what changes ar ebeing toyed with on the test server I have two things to say:<P>1: If we're supposed to be taking the damage we not only need a boost in our defensive skill - we need a boost in our taunt and bash skills.  If we take the damage and rangers (and others) dish it out we need better ways to get mobs off these people.<P>2: Please give us Lesser Shielding or Leach Instead of Grim Aura.  If we are defensive we don't need a spell to increase our ATK (not to mention the fact that the effects of this spell are negligable)<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'd have to say with the latest changes proposed on test, we look pretty well balanced.<P>The only place we're really still lacking is on the ubermob raids.  These MOBs hit so hard that only a warrior using a discipline will live long enough to be complete healed.  Obviously giving SKs the same defensive abilities would make us overpowered in the rest of the game, and giving us anything less than a warrior would just leave us dead before the first heal hit.<P>The problem is that we deal so little damage in comparison to a warrior that there's no point in putting an SK up against those MOBs.<P>What I propose, is to remove the lifetap immunity from the MOBs.  As it stands now, only the most uber of MOBs is immune to lifetaps, so our lifetaps work on 99% of the stuff out there already.  Removing the immunity would allow both Necromancers and Shadow Knights a secondary way to deal damage and contibute in the attack.<P>A level 60 Shadow Knight with high INT could deal about 3800 HP in lifetap damage over about 72 seconds on a full bar of mana.  Add to that a 1000 point Harm Touch (1500 if the MOB isn't disease resistant) and we'd be doing decent damage.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>While waiting on Absor's recap of the SK Talk thread, I'd like to throw in some comments about the current changes on Test :<P>5) Shadowknights: <P>a) Remove artificially inflated mana cost for pre level 50 lifetap spells <BR>Great idea, having to pay 2 to 3X the normal mana cost to cast spells, that are terribly weak for the lvl at which we get it, was totally ridiculous anyway. <P>b) Move Spirit Tap to level 55 <BR>Why not... <P>c) Move Drain Spirit to level 57 <BR>Why not, anyway due to its casting time superior to 5 secs, I anyway never use it and resort to Spirit Tap instead.<P>d) Add Drain Soul at level 60 <BR>Ok, here this simply gets ridiculous. This spell has a great dmg/heal for mana ratio, but just look at the casting time : 6.1 secs !!! <BR>We can't repeat it enough already, spells with casting times higher than 4 secs are simply unmanageable for a class that's supposed to be in contact. Even a turgured mob has every chance to interrupt a cast of that length, no SKs in their right mind would even bother trying to cast that while tanking, when they actually would need it most. <P>Look at that new spell you're offering to paladins at lvl 59, Celestial Cleansing. Its casting time is 1.5 secs, meaning a paladin as a fair chance of casting that spell successfully in between a mob's swings. That's exactly the kind of spells hybrids need : not too powerful, but with a fast casting time to make it useful while tanking ! Just looking at our class-specific Lifetap we quest for at lvl 50. Its casting time is 2.8 secs... <BR>Could you please design for us a high-lvl SK-only Lifetap along the same line of thought ? A casting time of 2 to 3 secs would be perfect for melee purposes. <P>e) Grim Aura added at level 22 <BR>Uhhh, at lvl 22, adding 6 points to an SK's attack rating is like a drop in the ocean, noone will bother casting it other than for the special gfx effect... Necros get it at lvl 4, SKs shouldn't get it later than lvl 15, and actually lvl 9 would be more appropriate for such a weak spell. Or if you disagree, remove it altogether, noone will miss it. <P>f) Move Shieldskin to level 34 <BR>SKs don't get new spells at lvl 34... Is it a typo for lvl 30 ? If so great move, it was really weak for the lvl at which we got it before, lvl 39. <P>g) Mini Intensify Death pet buff added at 29, 10% (min) haste 5 str 5 ac <BR>Again, SKs don't get new spells at lvl 29, so is it lvl 22 or 30 ? Getting that spell at lvl 22 would be ideal, since it's at that lvl that SK pets get weak to the point of virtual uselessness. <P>h) Add Diamondskin spell at 59 <BR>Hmm why not, but again its casting time is so long that you can't honestly think of using it while engaged in combat, esp. since you'd lose the peridot anyway if it gets interrupted . <P>i) Defense skill cap made exactly same as warriors <BR>Wow here I'm impressed, We didn't even hope to get it at the same lvl as warriors, but since monks and rogues are already there, it only makes sense. It also sets us between monks/rogues and warriors in terms of AC, which is appropriate for our role of plate-wearing defensive tanks. <P>____________ <P><BR>To sum it up, pre-50 the new spells, to the exception of Grim aura, seem to be right on the mark. The lvls at which they are given are a bit odd tho, maybe this is a bug ?Removing the triple to double penalty on the Lifetaps is only fair, also. <P>But post-50 the changes made, to the exception of the Defense increase, do NOTHING to help us fill our supposed role of secondary defensive tank. Defense raised to 252 won't make us survive more than a couple more seconds, and with luck even, against the plethora of new Velious mobs hitting for 250+ per attack. <P>We're still in dire need of a discipline that would give us a chance to effectively tank that kind of mobs without exhausting a healer's mana, if he can actually heal us before we get splattered and redirected to our home point. <BR>If you are looking for suggestions, a couple reasonable ones were already made to make Leechcurse a useful disc in that regard : <BR>- Change it so every attack, or 90% of them connect while the discipline is active (which is currently 20 secs). <BR>- Change the concept of Leechcurse to that of a reverse damage shield, that would heal the SK of around 33% of the damage dealt while active. <P>What I would advocate is simply scraping the lvl 55 SK discipline or move it down to lvl 52, 53, it does absolutely nothing to enhance our tanking, besides being virtually useless against boss mobs (enhanced HT still resisted by 90% of those). Instead, replace it by a retuned version of our current lvl 60 discipline :<P>LVL 55 - Leechcurse<BR>Makes you heal for the damage you deal for 15 seconds. All or close to all your melee attacks connect while the discipline is active. Refresh time would be 60 mins, but even the current 72 mins could do.<P>LVL 60 - Shield of Hatred<BR>Makes you automatically lifetap for the 2 minutes it is active 1/3 of the damage dealt to you. Adversely, your offensive power is also weakened by 1/3 of its total value. It's reuse time would be anywhere from 15 to 18 minutes. (Defensive refreshes every 10 mins and lasts for 3 mins in comparison).<P>There you go, 2 disciplines that are actually useful for a hybrid tank against boss mobs attacks, either AE-breath or melee, and still are watered-down versions of warrior ones.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>From reading these threads and seeing responses by the people in charge, it seems to me the vision of hybrids is this:<P>Rangers - offensive<BR>Bards  - all around utility (and songs)<BR>Paladin/SK - defensive<P>Now, with this is mind, why is it that, although Paladins and Shadow Knights are supposed to be THE defensive hybrids, BOTH those classes are the ONLY hybrids that do not have a defensive discipline!  <P>Rangers, at level 60, get Weaponshield.  This allows them to parry ALL attacks directed at them for 15 seconds, making them invulnerable to melee attacks in that time.  <P>Bards, at level 55, get Deftdance.  This  gives them the ability to automatically dodge EVERY attack AND automatically duel wield (off hand chance to swing will be 100%) for 10 seconds, making them invulnerable to melee attacks in that time and doing increased damage.<P>Now Paladins DO have a defensive skill at 60.  Sanctification, making them immune to MOST (and I need a pally to tell me what most includes) types of harmful spells.  If this makes them immune to "uber" mob AoE spells, this is an excellent ability.  This, however, SILL precludes them 'taunting' a mob off a warrior to share damage, or off a spell caster to keep them alive because, even WITH a higher defensive skill, Paladins just aren't going to last against mobs that may very well be over 60.<P>Shadow Knights, on the other hand, do NOT have a defensive ability per se.  Although it can be argued that Leechcurse, the level 60 discipline that heals self for every point of damage done, CAN be argued to be defensive, it is by no means an effective defensive discipline.  Shadow Knights, according to Verant, are NOT an offensive class, we do NOT have the same skill caps in offense or weapons as warriors, rogues, monks, or rangers.  We do NOT hit as often, and do not do as much damage, even with the same weapon, due to our lower attack rating.  <P>If we can't hit, and do less damage when we DO hit, this skill is useless.  I GUARANTEE you, if I'm supposed to be "defending" the others in my group and raid, and by this I presume to mean taunting and taking hits, the amount of damage I do to the mob and heal myself IN NO WAY will offset the amount of damage I take, being single, double, triple, and even quad hit for 300 to 600 (or more) points of damage per shot.  <P>I propose either replacing or moving leechcurse down a level and replacing it with Weaponshield.  This would in no way "step on the toes" of fighters (warrior/monk/rogue), given their ability to auto parry AND riposte every attack, but still give us the ability to actually  'defend' those in our raid and live to tell about it.  The amount of damage we prevent with this will be MUCH greater then the amount of damage we can 'heal' ourselves.  <P>This ability alone would, at the very least, make us a viable option to the fighter classes if no or not enough  are available.  We wouldn't be AS good, but at least we'd be effective.  And if WE are more effective, the whole RAID will be more effective.  Fighters disciplines last a few seconds, when their discipline ends an SK could taunt off the fighter, keeping THEM alive, while still allowing them to do the massive amounts of damage they can do.  If you want us (including Paladins, they could use this ability as well) to be "Defenders" then you have to give us the ability to defend.  Otherwise, it's like telling us you want us to be pilots, and not supplying us with a plane . . . <P>- Vorrek, 52 SK, Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
