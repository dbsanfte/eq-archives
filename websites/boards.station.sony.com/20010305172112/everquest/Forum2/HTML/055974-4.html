&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>There are a couple problems I've noticed with the cleric class.<P><BR>1) MoK fizzle rates are pretty nasty.  I have my skills maxed but this thing fizzles like crazy.  No other spell I have even close to the same fizzle rates, even on higher level spells using the same type of skill.  Resists are also pretty high even on much lower level mobs.  Since the MoK nerf this has been happening and due to the fizzles and resists is now found on page 50 of many clerics spellbooks.<P><BR>2)  Aegolism-  The idea of the spell is great.  Everyone loves a symbol/ac/hb combo with a huge duration.  It saves buff slots for all the stat warriors out there.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  The problems with this spell are really too great to make this spell usefull though.  First off the spell is very easy to dispell.  Also the spell is a single target spell and requires a great deal of mana and 10pp in reagents per cast.  Realistically the cleric has two options.<BR>    First Option-  Cast heroic bond, naltrons mark, and then whatever ac buff the cleric chooses (I usually use bulwark).  For a group of 6 all recieving these buffs requires 3050 mana and 10pp in reagents.  Duration is about an hour and a half.<BR>    Second Option-  Cast Aegolism on each person in the group.  For a group of 6 this is talking 4500 mana and around 60pp in reagents.  Duration is 2 and a half hours.<BR>    These two options cannot be combined or interchanged without in effect losing effectiveness of the spells.  Heroic bond and naltrons mark are not usefull when some in the group have aegolism.<P>  From a mana and hp gain over time perspective- <P>The net gain of using a lvl 60 spell over much lower level spells is marginal if any gain at all.  Look at the similarities of the mana cost per benefit and divide that by the duration of the spell.  Hardly any difference at all.<P>  From a cost effective perspective-<P>Aegolism requires @ 60pp in reagents.  The other option requires @ 25pp in the same amount of time.  Not much more needs to be said.<P>  From a practical perspective-<P>Aegolism is incredibly easy to dispell.  I remember right when I scribed the spell that I immediately casted it on myself.  I couldn't hardly wait.  About 1 minute after casting the spell on myself the mob my group was fighting turned and casted a spell.  The message I saw was you feel annulled  ... your aegolism fades.  It's kinda funny in a way, I swear when I pick the group buff method the group every once in awhile gets debuffed by a mob we are fighting.  With aegolism I swear the mobs know it's up, and they just zap 1200hp and a ton of ac immediately.  With the group buff method I usually just lose one buff on dispells.<P>  In summary, Aegolism has no advantage over group buffing.  There is marginal mana gained but at a heavy reagent cost and is really impractical.  I would really hope that a lvl 60 spell would be an upgrade and not a downgrade to the spells a cleric learned and scribed even 8 levels earlier.<P>  There are alot of room for improvement on this spell.  Possibly make it a very mana expensive group spell and maybe reducing the duration and reagent cost.  Another possibility would be to make the spell a group ac buff, in line with naltrons mark and heroic bond.  I personally would prefer the group ac buff, because that would deal with the dispell issue.<P><BR>3)  Possibly having some form of curse spell.  Even though the majority of curse type spells are in the necromancer realm, I would think clerics would have some form of curse also.  These could be religion/diety specific spells that would lower ac, hit points, or when the npc flees.  In roleplay the mob would just seem to be having a bad day.  He would be taking more hits than usual (AC), possibly just not feeling well (lower max hp), or just not feeling very motivated (flees at higher health).  I would enjoy these types of spells, even if they only slightly effected the npc.<P>  Overall I would say that clerics are a balanced class.  Our defensive skills (defensive cap/ dodge/ ect) are where they should be.   We are a plate class so yes we enjoy the advantage of a nice crisp ac.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  This is what keeps us from taking an arrow in the back or one of those dirty a$$ling backstabs, not our combat skills.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A few things for clerics, mostly repeating what others have said but toned down a bit.<P>Invis would be great for traveling. I run with root and atone up right now<P>Medding while standing still.  I stand, heal, sit, stand, heal, sit.....  Some people asked to be able to fight, not needed.  Just be able to stand still and be medding would help greatly<P>self mana regen.  At level 50 or so, a self mana regen that is maybe the same as Breeze or so and stacks with chanter and bard mana regen.<P>Slight reduction in time for CH.  Or maybe a post 50 improved complete heal that is slightly faster.<P>Better undead DD.  The other casters are more effecient and do more damage than clerics on undead, thought we were the masters of undead slaying?<P>Ports?  We should not get group ports.  I do like the idea or being able to port to your home temple.  But self ports at higher levels at druid rings would help us greatly when someone on the other side of the world needs a rez.<P>Heals.  Our heals should be even more effective than they are.  Give us a little more bonus.  Also, clerics should be able to cast GH and any other spells that are shared with other classes fast than those other classes or make the other classes cast slower if you don't want to reduce our casting time.<P>Divine aura.  Should be immune to stun with this spell.  Change this to a button like Paladin LOH, I rarely mem it because I just don't have the room.  Recently on a Fear raid I had to use this spell to save my butt, but right after the spell dropped,the mob came back after me, we should be lower on the agro list after casting this, not at the top.<P>Group AC buff is a must.<P>Celestial healing needs to be usable while a PC is dotted or whatever.  A group version of this spell would be good at higher levels also.<P>Defense.  We need better defense for starters, make it equal to offense at the minimum.  Raising dodge would also be good.<P>Bind wounds?  My skill is maybe 5 in this.  The time spend binding, I could med enough mana for a heal that does more I believe.<P>Regen.  Clerics are the ultimate healers, we should get the regen line of spells also.<P>Cleric DMF?  Clerics should get a spell that does lev and/or underwater breathing.  Floating on ones gods power makes sense.<P>Cures.  A cure everything at higher levels makes sense.<P>Pets?  Making a pet that has some limited healing would be more useful than the pet we get now as I have heard.<P>I think this is about it</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>#1 <BR>As stated above, I believe it is good to give the shaman's and druids better faster heals, but let me side track a second here. I play on Rallos, and giving shamans and druids (mainly druids) makes them near impossible to kill. How can you disrupt a 3 second cast heal that gives a ton of hps back? But I guess you could care less about those issues because Rallos and Tallon and such are only 3 out of the near 20+ servers there already is.<P>#2<BR>Ok getting on with it, I think for sure you should give us clerics more FUN spells, and maybe some form of mana regeneration spell(like wizard Harvest). At lvl 58 my mana moves like a bubble every 5 mins without clarity it seems. <P>#3<BR>Temple Gates would be a big asset for clerics. <P>#4<BR>Group AC buff for sure would also be good. <P>#5<BR>Clerics are still very 2 demensional, all we do is ch sit and such. You may think thats what other class's do (sit and cast) but its not the same. They at least have some choice of spells to use. Clerics only get to cast heals. Add something to make this less tedious. <P>#6<BR>Next thing, Un-nerf MoK... It was the only fun spell clerics have at the present time and it plain sux. It doesnt heal near as much as it should. <P>#7<BR>Get rid of that stupid 600 mana casting hammer. It is just the worste spell ever. It taunts, and has 100 hps. "Zoblak has been slain by a young fire goblin" should i say more? I understand it is meant as a "fun" spell but it isnt worth the mana, maybe give it 1000 hps and it might be worth the mana, and could maybe tank something for a little while. <P>Anyways im sure most clerics would like to see some of the changes i suggested implemented.<P>-Xenith 58th Templar Rallos Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There are only a few things I would like to see changes.<P>1. MoK should be unnerfed to the previous effect.<P>2. The fizzle rate of Divine light, incredible fizzle at level 60. Yes, my skills are maxed. ;p<BR>Casting time should be shortened in my opinion, it uses nearly as much mana as CH and long casting time.<P>3. Casting time of Complete heal should be shortend to several seconds also. You do know why.<BR>At level 60, you have many occasions to fight mobs that hits 250 to 300. 10seconds really doesnt help, so we end up with using mana inefficient Divine light, and go oom pretty fast.<BR>(Especially, when your main puller or tank is SK with an epic, Elixir doesn't stick. *sigh*)<P>If MoK won't be unnerfed, we do not need to have this spell since nobody I know ever bother to mem it anymore. Cleric pet is a joke, just an entertainment.<BR>Level 60 group CH, I dont see any occasion I can use this spell. Too slow casting, and not mana efficient.<P>Invis for clerics is not necessary, can go without, never really had problem.<P>My 2 cents.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A couple of ideas for the Cleric class:<P>- A regeneration line, (Perhaps Regeneration, Rejuvenation, Revitalization since Chloroplast just doesn't sound quite right for a cleric).  I don't see what's unclerical about increased regeneration.<P>- Perhaps a spell that cures DoTs on a player.  Could be called Cleansing?<P>- A lot of discussion about a better pet, so I was thinking about the whole Avatar thing, and came up with this(this is only a start):  A "pet" that the Cleric summons.<BR>  *Half hp of cleric<BR>  *Rest of stats the same as cleric<BR>  *Wields the Hammer of Requital, wears a shield<BR>  *Looks like a &lt;insert race here&gt; wearing plate, wielding the hammer, wearing the generic shield(This may run into some trouble, but I'm sure it could be done, worst comes to worst just have it look like and Enchanter pet I guess)<BR>  *Has double attack and bash.<BR>So pretty much the "pet" avatar would be a paladin with half the hps.  Obviously this is overpowered as is, so to balance it out:<BR>  *Cannot be buffed<BR>  *Every point of damage the pet takes, the cleric takes too.  Basically the avatar is just an extension of the cleric.  This would prevent the cleric from being a mage basically, as any damage would cause the cleric to stop medding.<BR>  *Casting of Divine Aura, Barrier would cause pet to suicide.<BR>This is an idea I just thought up and it'll have problems for sure, but I think it'd be neat to have something like this =]  It wouldn't be useful at all(similar to the pet we currently have) but it'd be fun for sure =]<P>- Prayer(Cleric and Paladin skill).  I've read over some posts about this, and here's another approach at it.  Have the prayer effect radiate out from Cleric like a bard song.  The effect gives a 1 mana regeneration to anyone in the effect area who is also praying.  Perhaps a max regen of 5 or something so that a kajillion players don't just sit in the same area for uber mana regen.<P>-I also support the bandaid while medding idea. =]<P>Ok, now that I'm done with the serious stuff, skip the rest of the post for the useless stuff, as the rest are not real suggestions(or are they? =])<P>All melee classes have disciplines, casting classes need one too.  A counterpart for the Fearless disc would be: Fearful.  This disc causes the caster to run around in circles(at amazing speeds), and upon getting hit, train everyone around them, and proceed to get half the zone killed.  Many casters do this very well already, and I'm sure they wouldn't mind having it automated.<P>And then we could have a NoFear disc.  This disc would cause the caster to start casting as many spells as possible on whatever hits it, because they'll stop getting hit if the target dies faster, and they are just helping, right?<P>I also think all forms of Ressurection should be upgraded as well.  Upon casting of the spell, and the other playing clicking "yes" on the box that pops up, 100 plat will be directly deducted from that player's account and put into the cleric's account.  Too poor?  Fail message would be "Ressurection cannot be cast on corpse... player too poor!"<P>And to help with the high cost of gems for symbol spells, maybe a "Summon Peridot" spell would be in line...<P>More to come =]<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Some ideas that I think would be a good thing for clerics.  As seen by a lvl 55 cleric.<P>1.Make a 3rd spell in the divine aura series that has the added benifit of making you unstunable with maby a slightly faster regen rate during the durability.<P>reason: It could be greatly benificial when you are doing that cr a mob sees you and you need to head for the closest zone.<P>2. Give clerics bash.  I know alot of people think this is useless for a cleric and others want it because they think it woudl be cool but it woudl balance the game.<P>reason: since higher lvl mobs cant be stunned, or those that can seem to have a a very high resist rate to stuns bash could help solve this problem.<P>3. Self Portal to Temple.  I know everyone and their brother is requesting this but it could be very useful also.<P>reason: your bound at seb you run out of peridots and your only choice is to wait around for a wizar dor druid to shwoup or freeup so you can get a ride to the closest town that hopefully yoru not kos at so you can stock back up. Granting this spell would reduce the dependance a cleric has on a druid or wizard.  Also it saves the cleric alot of time if they want to bind in front of the dungeon/zone they are camping and the closest town to sell/buy stuff from is a large distance away.  If you need to for balance make the spell a very mana intensive spell with a very long cast time.<P>4. Improved offensive spells vs undead.<P>reason: ware supposed to be the bane of the dead yet a wizard, necromancer, or even some of the other classes can out damage us vs these monsters.  It also opens up the clerics choice of grouping vs solo.  I was able to solo specs from 34-48, and with the current line of spells I can maby do a or 2 skeletons in karnor castle if root holds.<P>5. More dots vs undead.<P>reason: just more variety to play with in spells.  We can nuke but dotting would give us a 2nd spell to use against them.  Improves the clerics role if they want tobe offensive.<P>6.  Fix celestiel healing and elixer so they stack with dots. <P>reason: its annoying when I am waiting 14 seconds for my breastplate to cast celesteal elixer and then then spell doesn't take effect becuase th eperson gets dotted.  This can get very annoying wyen you are waiting 14 seconds for a breast plate effect to cast.<P>7.  Revamp the lvl 54 hammer spell.  Make it into a pet similar to the enchanters pet, or make it into a pet that heals a target that you select aka /pet jebber which would allow the pet to start healing a target and causing aggro to possibly pull a mob off someone and take it to itself.  Either way it helps in group situations to get a mob off the cleric and help them cure the group.<P>8.  Reduce the fizzling on 51+ healing spells.<P>reason: Its very annoying when you fizzle divine light 2 times in a row in an emergency and its a spell that you cast regurly.  Some of the spells just seem to have too high of a percentage to fizzle.<P>9.  Group ac buff.  <P>reason: save time and mana.  we already have group hp, and group symble, why not a group ac buff to save us time.<P>10.  Self only invisibility.  Not fully needed but very useful.<P>reason: simple for doing corpse recovry.<P>11.  Improve the rate of working on death pact<P>reason: for a 5pp reagant and an effect that seems to work only about 5% of the time its just not useful.<P>12.  Mass resist.  Give us a spell that casts resist fire, cold, magic, poison, and disease. for the cost of just 1 spell slot to cast.<P>reason: saves alot of time while buffing.<P>13.  A resist debuff.  This could be a line of spells that cover individual or all resists.  For example a magic debuff, or say one thats fire/cold/magic debuff<P>reason: Gives us more of a role than just healing and ressing.<P>14. Possible a lvl 60 res that is the same as lvl 56 only makes the person come back without res effects and with full mana if they are a mana using class.<P>reason: saves on down time.  woudl make people drool to have a lvl 60 cleric in their group vs having the backup healers instead.<P>Things we don't need:<P>1. auto med - thats what enchanters are for to clarity us<P>2. group temple.  our roll was never to be that of a teleporter/evacer.<P>3. better offensive combat skills.  as much as we want to melee we aren't needed for that specialy post 50.<P>4.  Better nukes vs non undead.  were not supposed to be efficent against these.  <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I really think Clerics should Get Invis, and See invis.  We are pretty much the only casters that cant invis. I mean, even a Shadowknight can invis themselves, and we cant. That really sucks. Invis wouldn't mess up any of the balancing. We could use another usefull spell, its not like we have any DoTs, Snares, Debuffs... nothing really good just Heals and Stuns. An Invis would be very useful, and would not ruin balancing. I would like to be able to go to pull spots in Dungeons without hoping my invis doesnt wear off. I'd like to be able to cast it myself.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Most of the posts here seem to be regarding the abilities of a High-level Cleric. I, for one, wish to make the following request for all the Mid-level Clerics.<P>For many months I attempted to obtain the Cleric Quest Armor. I don't mind that you have to run all over creation to find the pieces. I don't even mind that most of the pieces have an 8 hour spawn. What has always bothered me, is that many of the pieces are being camped/farmed by someone from some other class! Many of the pieces are much easier to collect if you have water breathing or tracking. While attempting to complete the quests most of the people that I met who were also working on the same quest, were not Clerics. This is wrong! <P>Having the icons and ingots be NoDrop is fine. I do not mind having most of the armor pieces being dropable (and thus saleable). But, if I could only ask for one thing, I would request that the quest only be completeable by Clerics. <P>The only reason other players are completing these quests are: 1.) to sell the armor on the open-market or 2.) to do the quest for a Cleric who can't otherwise do it. Both of these reasons are wrong. Clerics should not have to pay high prices for these farmed items. And Clerics who can't do the quests, don't deserve the armor.<P>Thanks for listening.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Now, I would like to start by saying that no matter what happens in this game. It is stil a big WOOOT from me to all that yall do.  That goes to PC's and GM's...guides...well. I would like to appologize also, I don't have a cleric. I tried...but, HATED IT.  I do have a suggestion. While playing my Wizard (PROVEN WARWIZZIE 34) I heard a cleric talking about Meditating.  This struck me as odd. Never thought about it, but in my D and D days...clerics didn't meditate for mana.  They PRAYED, they PRAYED all the time.  Being that you must have a diety to be a cleric, why do they MEDITATE when they need mana? Why is there not a line of spells (IE. Harvest for wizzies) that ask their diety for mana to continue the fight( LONG RECAST TIME please, not an unbalancer )?  Last item is simply this, as a worshiper of SOLUSEK RO, I have a spell that gives me the ability to imbue a fire emerald (don't quote me, never used it), Why is there not a DIETY based series of spells for Clerics?  I think this would add to game play since certain Diety's have certain inate ways of life.  This is all just my perspective.  I am a Wizard at heart, I always will be.  Just wanted to put in my 10cp.<P>Proven Warwizzie<BR>CULT OF NYARL<BR>INNORUUK</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Way back in the beginning of this thread, someone made a very good point regarding our abilities and how they're being portioned out to the "secondary" healers. The point he made wasn't obvious, but when I realized it, I was thunderstuck.<P>To wit... I'm sure everyone will agree that Clerics are a "group" class. They have to be, since they can't solo their way out of Crushbone at level 15. Hell, more than two orcs and a 15 cleric is probably a goner.  Shaman, and especially Druids, are *not* necessarily a group class. Shaman have a little more trouble soloing than a Druid, but not much.<P>Riddle me this: If the Vision™ for EverQuest is to encourage grouping, but the majority of Druids and Shaman play them for their solo ability, why are you giving them the abilities of a true GROUP-ONLY class? Clerics should be IMPROVED, not have their core abilities portioned out to another class. As it is, a Clerics life is sheer boredom, unless you're lucky enough to be in a group w/ two Clerics. Sure, a Druid or Shaman will never match a Cleric in pure healing ability, but why should they care? They can always go solo for a while if they need some excitement or activity. A Cleric is *forced* by the very nature of his class to sit on his duff and med, stand, heal, med, etc., etc., ad nauseum. Most of the Clerics who have posted here have little complaint with our lot in life. Most of us knew the job when we signed up for it. Those who didn't and got a rude surprise are now playing Druids or Shaman, I'm sure. Please do something to make the class a little less dull. Add some variety to our spells. Give us NEW ways to heal things. <P>Here's a couple ideas off the top of my head:<BR>1) In the “Find new ways to heal things Dept.” More HoT-type spells – (HoT = Heal over Time, if it didn’t hit you right away) Definitely in line w/ the class concept and easily scaled down from the high-level version(s). If we’re going to be the best healers, give us the variety that the other classes have in THEIR chosen professions. The variety you could add here could be staggering…<P>2) A Curse line - make'em DoTs, debuffs, whatever - A Cleric dedicates his life to smiting the enemies of his God. If you can bestow the blessing of your God on your friends via buffs, why can you not also reverse that blessing to curse your enemies? (This has boggled me since the beginning...)<P>3) Divine Sanctuary –  A solution to the Invis that everyone is asking for, without actually giving it to us. MOBs ignore you if they’re not aggro already, drops your hate to 0 for all aggro’d MOBs for the duration otherwise  - Shouldn't be hard to code, fits the concept and would be extremely useful. It fits the class better than Invis and basically gives us what we need to move about w/o getting killed trying to BE a Cleric. <P>4) Please do something about the weapon spells. Suggestions:<BR>a) If we can petition our God to provide us a weapon, why does it not at least give a bonus versus Undead, or some other property worthy of a gift from a God? We're not Magicians creating stuff out of thin air, we are the followers of a deity asking for his assistance. Give it a reagent, hell Clerics are broke already, what's one more sink? A chunk of Brellium ore for us Dwarves? Elegant fit, isn't it? About the right cost for a reagent at that level too, I would think. You’re not going to be summoning one of these every battle. Procs a weak Undead DD for the first one, a vs. Summoned DD for the next higher? Be creative here!<BR>b) If our God sees fit to give us an animated weapon, why would it be such a wuss? This is a gift from your God, for crying out loud. Has any Cleric ever cast UHoF in serious expectation of it giving worthwhile assistance? If you will not improve it for fear of poaching from the other pet casters, by all means, get rid of it. I would much rather have it replaced by something useful.<P>This is more of a rant than a suggestion 8-/<BR>	Imagine what Clerics could be, or what could be done with them if their power were based on their deity. The followers of Innouruuk would have powerful Curses, followers of Tunare, and probably Karana,  would actually BE Druids instead of a Druid class, worshippers of Erollisi would be almost Enchanter-like in their ability to charm. The Priests of Rallos would be war-priests, more concerned w/ dealing damage than healing it. Clerics of Brell Serillis would command the power of the Earth.  I’m sure you can imagine the rest. Absor, if one of your “secret projects” at VI needs an idea, consider this one. The variety and usefulness of the class would be enchanced, giving replayability not available w/ the current arrangement. If you really like the Cleric as a class, you could create one in every race and never tire of the options they gave, each being different at the edges, but the same at the core.<P>To all who slogged their way through this, I apologize for its length, but I hope some of the ideas fired your imagination. If VI needs us to provide new and fresh ideas for them to implement, then let’s oblige them. In the end, we’re only helping ourselves.<P>In sum Absor, please take a serious look at ALL the ideas suggested throughout this thread. As far as “balance” goes, unless VI suddenly changes its Vision™ and decides all classes should have the same relative “power”, dealing w/ nuisance issues like weird stacking should address all but the playability aspects of “balance”.  A person who has a Cleric as a prime, as I do, likes doing what we do, and hates it at the same time. I could have played a Druid, or a Shaman… or even an int caster. Well, maybe not the int caster. 8-P Instead, I chose a life of serving others. Please do something to acknowledge the sacrifice a Cleric has to make in order to be successful and give us some variety to spice things up.  Thanks…<P>	Plaeto<BR>	Priest of the Underfoot<BR>	Tallon Zek<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I really don't think medding while standing is going to help ballance us. Instead of sitting we will just stand there all the time. I think clerics do need a slight mana regen spell. Wizards have Harvest, Necros have liche, Mages have rods, Enchanters well this is obvious, Druids there skin spell and tree form at 50+, and Shaman have Cannabilize. Clerics are the only class with no sort of mana regen solo of all the spell casting classes not including hybrids. I think a prayer spell would be a good idea for this. It does not have to be a long spell make it like Harvest. Cast once regain mana cant cast again for a while.<P>Next FIX Celestial healing/alixir. I think I should be able to heal some one with rabies if they have it with this spell. This is kinda lame.<P>Fix Mark of Karn. I know you said you can not do that to the original effect thats fine but PLEASE do something to make it more then just a dispell.<BR>Make the resist rate a little higher fizzle rate a little lower. I don't know about other clerics but the dispell factor of it can be a bit annoying to any one wanting to debuff, or dot the creature.<P>Next get rid of the damn pet. Either that or make it worth using. I would much rather have a group ac buff then this gem of a spell. What a turd it turned out to be.<P>In the end I think clerics are one of the most ballanced classes. But I also and most agree as a game play stand point Shaman and Druids are 2 of the most powerfull so adding to them with out adding to others seems even more overpowerd. I think YES they do need better heals cause Superior heal sucks. BUT do not neglect everyone else.<P>I doubt there will be any changes made to us as a class and that to me is a shame. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This whole question has resurfaced many of the issues I had with my cleric. I created my cleric in the first week of EQ's release and have played him since. Originally one of the advantages of being a cleric over being any other priest class was the promise of better AC (via plate mail). As time has gone on Verant has continually diminished this benefit until the current state where it is no long even an issue. I agree with the previous posters who have said our offense and defense cap need to be raised. This would allow clerics to regain our uniqueness amongst the priest classes and would restore the original benefits. For those who say giving clerics higher offense will allow us to encroach on tank space haven't played a tank. Without things like dual wield, double attack, parry, and riposte plus with the generally low strengths of clerics, we will never encroach on their space.<P>My second concern is the notion that Absor keeps saying about it not being about classes being equal. He misses or ignores the point that when people make classes they do compare them. If I had known how things would turn out, long ago I would have chosen a druid or shaman. Why? Because they have the ability to solo where clerics (admittedly can solo) have a much more difficult time of it. I'm not saying we should be able to solo better...all I'm saying is that we need abilities to compensate for this. Otherwise the number of genuine clerics (nonpowered) will continue diminish...which is maybe what Verant wants *winks* I mean just think about...less clerics is less resurrections is more time played in EQ to advance *laughs*. <P>The pet we get is completely useless...I agree that it should either be improved in some way or should just be replaced with a useful spell.<P>The prayer idea is great. I think it should be a skill that, much like Hide, only works when a person is sitting still. It could work indefinately until you move or do any other action. And it could have a long recycle time (ie 15 or 20 minutes). The amount of mana returned could be based on skill at prayer. This skill fits within the roleplaying realm and also fits the bill for powergamers.<P>I am less worried about Mark of Karn. Admittedly it has been weakened but there are still occassions where I have used it to great effect.<P>If Verant doesn't do something for the class I will continue to use my cleric for the one enjoyable purpose...levelling up characters on the other account in the house  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> It is the one thing my cleric can do for me!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> And that's what it is all about isn't it?

</FONT><HR>I dont usualy post, but after reading alot of this thread I think some folks are missing something very obvious.  Clerics are one of the classes that make 50+ groups happen.  With out a cleric many dungeons in the game are just flat unplayable.  Unless of course you want to have downtime around 5min per fight that is.  Most of us who have played the game in the challengeing areas know this.  I am not saying that you have to have a cleric to go to these hard dunegons, but a cleric makes the group so much better it is not even funny.  <P>I have see a lot of folks complain about druid/shamen takeing over the clerics role.  Heh, it wont happen.  Withouth Complete Heal, no one can keep up with mana efficency like a cleric.  Druids and Shamen will be able to last a fight or 2, but will then need to med.  With a cleric you and a good balanced group you can fight nonstop deep in places like Seb and HS.  No one likes down time and thats basicly what everyone is fighting here.  About the only thing that druids/shamen got that was of any use is getting SH lowered to level 51.  Hopefuly they will be able to cast the spell now with out Fiz, and may be good for keeping casters alive or topping folks off after fighting and playing the back up healer, but SH just plain does not heal enough to keep a tank alive.  55 Remedy?  Lol... this is a bone.  The spell is nice to at times but also does not heal enough to make it a staple of Tank healing.  60 Version of Divine Light... LOL, how many 60 druids do you know?  Let me tell you about DL, I use it only when the crap has hit the fan and I cant CH my tanks.  At that point I start getting folks ready for evac or to run.  DL sucks way to much mana for healing just under 1k hps.  There is no faster way for a cleric to go OOM that to chain DL for about 6-7 times.  Rember for 50 more Mana you can CH that Tank and then have some time to med insead of having to chain a 350 mana spell just to keep folks alive.<P>What does this all mean?  It means clerics are the uber healers.  This will not change... unless they give druids and shamen CH.  At that point class distinction is blurred so badly that the game will be broken.  To all the folks who say they will not play clerics anymore, /boggle.  If you want to play the game at 50+ you have to have a cleric.  When I say play the game I mean crawl dungeons and kill dragons too, not quad kite raptors in Tims Deep.<P>Folks have a lot of ideas about what clerics should get to make up for everyone else being buffed up.  Most of what a cleric needs is more utility spells.  They have said they will not give us Diety specific spells (/cry).  That would be awesome.  Temple port (self or group) would rock, and infringe on druid abilities about as much as giving them their healing upgrades.  The scope of a temple port is extremly limited, and more in the nature of cool stuff and back up evac than anything else.

</FONT><HR>Okay, I am pleased to be able to post and have someone listen. Here we go, these are all suggestions with a little feedback. Pick and choose I like them all.<P>First off, while it is understood that clerics were given the role of healer, I am quite sure almost any out there will agree that boredom strikes after about 35th lvl. "To a lesser extent we may summon the wrath of our gods" We can? It seems to me that we dont have enough offense to kill anything that is worth killing. Yes in the lower levels we can kill an even or so. But we lose that power with each level and get to the point of inability. To a lesser extent means nothing post 40. In pvp we dont have enough fire power to kill anyone,and to top it all off, each DD spell requires you to cast a prep spell just so you will be able to cast that 6 second casting time without interuption.Our melee skills are suppose to be somewhat good, we turn out to be not much better than a strait caster.Now this is quite perplexing, the shaman has dots a pet, was just given new heals, has more and by far better buffs and they get better weapons (until epic)<P>What I propose:<P>Give us angel form, a copy to the druid spell wolf form. But give levitation, a slower form of SoW, add a few resistances (like DMF), and some attack bonus.<P>Possibly add a pet, it can be weaker like the shaman pet is. (At high levels we are not important enough to our gods to be given a servant of sorts?) Call it guardian angel and make it look like the enchanter pet if need be. I know you are trying to avoid new graphics. Make it availiable post 40 and weak as the shaman pet.<P>PLEASE give us slightly more melee skills. I have seen little need for defense upgrades, but offense is in severe need. If I cant kill them with my spells then what...not like I am any good with this hammer...please change that. Or atleast give us the previously mentioned pet.<P>Give us better DD or add in some type of DoT/Curse. I know we are mainly defense, but we cant kill anything with our offense...thats sad!<P>Take a look at how you are treating evil clerics, I am a dark elven cleric. I have to kill clerics of Innoruuk to get my planes armor. BAD INNORUUK FACTION? Make the armor questable for evil clerics. Look at what you are asking us to do for our cleric quest armor... Good deeds? why...im evil...<P>Possibly add in some diety specific spells, different for each god. Such as rodcet nife followers will recieve a UBER set of heals. Those of Quellios will recieve a type of mezz. Those of Innoruuk and Bertoxx a set of DoT type spells. Those of Marr can have better buffs. Those of the other Marr (love) can even have a type of charm. This may need a little work to not infringe on other classes, but it is a GREAT idea. And will make gods play a bigger role in the clerics life.<P>I like the idea of resistance spells. A such for resist blindness it will thwart the first 2 blind spells cast on you, more as you gain levels. Disease and poison the same. It is very nice. But needs to be used carefully.<P>These are all just suggestions, pick and choose please.<BR>Please save this class...boredom has long since struck in and my cleric is getting dusty in my character inventory.<P>Thank you for your time<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think that clerics should not be able to be stunned while under Divine Aura.  I consider that a bug.<P>IF you have a divine aura around you, in which nothing can hit you at all, how on earth can something stun you?  It makes no sense whatsoever.  Like I said, I consider it a bug that just hasn't been fixed yet (hey they've only had about 2½ years to debug EQ haha)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OK, First my apologies for mentioning anything thats been discussed before :-)<P>All try to make this as inclusive as possible and still mantain a since of brevity.<P>1) Lull should work like single target Harmony.  Nuff said.  That goes for all classes that can Lull.<P>2) Doesnt make since to me that Verant saw fit to increase the healing powers of the druid/shaman without bothering to look at any crossover traits the cleric would benefit from, i.e Regen, DoTs, other buff types.<P>3) Cost of mana for buff spells is out of line at the higher levels.  As a cleric you almost dread getting a new single target buff (especially the Sheild line) because the mana cost for casting on an entire party is too expensive.<P>4) Gem or money item loot drops should be spread evenly among all the high-level dungeons.  Why make sebelis have such a higher drop rate than any other dungeon in Kunark for example.<P>5) Don't think I have seen this one before, but introduction of Silence from the D&D upbringing you will not admit you garnished for developing this game.  Effect:  keeps casters from casting, could have varying degrees of duration/mana cost.<P>6) Do something with the hammer line to make it worthwhile.  Procs, charges of heals, stats, anything.<P>7) Probably lose the pet.. unless its changed to live past the first encounter.<P>8) Yaulp is a joke in its current form.<P>9) Deity specific spells would be cool, but somehow will probably be unbalancing :-)<P>10) Make MoK more effective.<P>11) Fizzle rates on high level spells are atrocious.  If anything the cleric should be the one class who doesnt EVER fizzle on a heal spell :-D<P>12) Increase the progression of diety specific quests for clerics.<P>13) Perhaps introduce Stun Command at an earlier lvl and then add a secondary version at the 55 location for cycling stuns.<P>Hmm, why that's all I will add.  All in all I like my cleric, and think the class should continue to remain defensive in nature.  But anything to help would be appreciated.<P>Kal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Sorry you are ALL being FAR too complacent about this issue!<P>If Verant wants to truly 'Balance' the classes then they should be completely willing to do so for the Cleric class.<P>Let's face it, Druids and Shammy's are great classes and can do so much more than Clerics - who are supposed to be the definitive healing class.<P>Traditionally, and in most games, Clerics are more than healers - they go into battle, standing alongside the other melee's.  Every other game, except EQ, treats Clerics in this manner.  Instead VI gives us pretty armor to sugar-coat a weak class and otherwise boring class! (and please don’t send me crap about Clerics not being boring…I’ve played 5 other classes past 40).<P>You want to be a REAL Cleric as it were intended to be - here's how to do it!<P>1)Clerics should regain mana - regardless whether they are sitting, standing or dancing.  Clerics receive their mana from the gods - not themselves.  Pure casters should sit, however by the divine nature of the Cleric they should just receive mana.  I have done nothing but sit since level 10 - the only thing I have looked forward to be the disappearance of that book - FUN WOW - now I get to see what’s going on.  Of course I can't do anything but sit - but at least VI was kind enough to let me watch the game - I'm so glad I pay them each month for that GREAT service.  (As a note, there are many new MMOPRG's that treat Clerics as such - in most of these games Clerics do not suffer from the same 'sit and med' penalties that VI has instilled upon us!<P>2) Up our attack and defense not through skill but through an immediate bonus at certain levels.  Let's face it, as a class we AVOID getting hit or hitting as much as possible.  If VI does, indeed, choose to up these skills then they must do it as a bonus - to be fair to all those who are 50+ and couldn’t possibly build up these skills without being pulverized. (Again this supports my first comments about Clerics being able to 'Stand and Regain Mana'.<P>3)Our Attack should be the least of melee classes - falling somewhere under the ranger!<P>4)I've heard that the cost of the reagent for 'Naltron' may be reduced to 5pp - that's NOT good enough! 2-3pp - that's it.  Most players past 49 demand to have Naltron, but very few pay - be fair to us and realize in the 'real EQ world' and not the 'gm test fantasy world' players can be downright RUDE!!!<P>5) If you refuse to make these changes then I WANT A PET.  I don't want a wimpy Enchanter pet - I want a PET THAT KICKS BUTT!  The Druid and Shammy classes are very powerful - you want balance then give us some power too -  a GOOD pet could balance that out. If we are to remain the wimpy, substandard melee/caster class that we are I WANT PROTECTION!!!<P>Clerics you must stand together.  You have had hard lives with by far the weakest, most boring class in EQ.  We choose this route for two reasons  a) to heal and b) to help other.  Now we are treated as a substandard class as we watch the other classes gain even more power to their great baselines.  This only makes Clerics bitter – very bitter! (I will admit I have become VERY BITTER since these discussions).  EQ is becoming a JOB for Clerics – where is the fun in THAT?<P>YOU ARE PAYING CUTOMERS.  Remember this. Your hard-earned money pays their salaries.  Think about that!  Think about how many times have you answered questionnaires in log-on in the past month – 5 maybe 6?  VI knows perfectly well that their customer service is appalling.  They are trying to make changes to correct this.  Unless you FIGHT for your class NOTHIGN will be done by these people!<P>I have spent 70+ days on my Cleric and I’m sure some of you have spent far more.  If they do not make changes to this class they we should hold them personally liable for 'time wasted'.<P>There is a LOT of MMORPG competition coming out VERY soon - VI knows this and so should you!<P>If they want to keep you as paying customers then THEY MUST BE WILLING TO MAKE THE CHANGES we demand!<P>Stop being a cleric for a moment and start being a customer!  VI is not a bunch of gods - they are a business that wants to see profit - THEY WILL make changes because they do not want to see attrition rates bottom out or customers move to other games. They also are creating a new MMOPRG ‘Star Wars Online’.  If they were smart they would treat their existing customers very well so they expect a high customer cross-over. <P>Gaming shouldn’t be about headaches, it should be about having fun.  Why is it that EQ has become SUCH a headache?  This is simple NOT right!  VI should be making players happy not causing them stress.  My husband and I own three accounts with EQ and I can honestly say I have no desire to try ANY of their future products unless I see some serious changes in the VI mindset – and I’m not alone!<P>Keep this in mind when you are writing these comments.  DEMAND these changes don't beg – it’s YOUR money!  You have the power over that ‘Cancel Account’ button and ultimately you have the power over them!<P>Band Trueheart<BR>52 Vicar of Tunare<P>*70 days of  Sit Band…Heal Band…. Fetch me a Buff Band*<BR>(Makes you wonder why they gave druids doggie form and not clerics!)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Well, here we go, another complaining session for another dissatisfied cleric.  <P>As everyone has previously stated at some point or another, clerics are healers.  And the second any cleric has complained about having a stagnant job, I am always given the same answer: "Clerics are healers, and should be content with their job."  <P>But are we JUST healers?  What about our other spells?  Does anyone remember our blind line of spells?  Perhaps making it a slight debuff would be nice.  Assume a mob is blind... how is it going to hit you?  Although I do understand the mob is a computer and computers know everything, a slight accuracy debuff would be nice just for effect.<P>While most other clerics are griping about they mana inefficient/low damage DD's, which is a problem to some extent, I find it more appaling that we go through so many levels of "A wan ghoul knight staggers."  My level 5 and level 44 spell give me the same effect.  OHH I MADE YOU STAGGER!  While a wizard has, soandso's skin has been frozen, ignites, bathed in fire, etc etc.  My personal favorite is Rend which says "Soandso screams as their flesh is rended by magic"  or something to that effect.  But no, when we fight we make people stagger.  <P>I did like however that Turning of the Unnatural gave the line "Soandso is crushed under the weight of Divine words".  I saw that and I was like "WOW!".  This is a text based game, if the text is boring, so is the game.  <P>So, in the end, I'd like to see some new text for each level of undead attack spells.  At least if we are ONLY going to attack undead, make it more interesting.  And guess what... this wouldn't even make it unbalanced =)<P>In regard to everyone's plea for self invis.  Although this would be a great skill, I don't think we really need it.  Paladins, warriors, monks- they don't have invis.  And its not far beyond us to ask the 99% of other players who have it. <P>What I would rather see done regarding invis is this- change improved invis to undead from self only to target.  When I bought this spell for 500p, I thought "YAY! now I can have a good invis to undead to use on people"  Well, nope.  Self only.  *shrug* I dont even use the spell mainly because then I'd have to invis myself, then invis someone else who needs it with regular ITU.  And if I am grouped, well, sunskin works MUCH better because I don't have to cast on group then myself.<BR>So maybe if we could get improved improved invis to undead for targets, that would be nice.<P>I read the posts about "Prayer."  I can't say I have heard of such a good idea.  Sure, we need enchanters to give us clarity, and necro's to mana pump, but here is the problem I face.  Enchanters are extremely difficult to find most of the time unless you are guilded with them.  And even still, almost as rare as clerics.  Necro's have been so driven out of grouping areas that its even hard to find one to join a group.  So most of the time, I do have no mana regen.  I will say that Celes heal and CH to give me more time to med, but that is what I get, more time to med.  Even if the spell restricts our actions, such that we can't attack or heal while doing it, it would still be an added  bonus because we could be stunning more, or gods forbid, meleeing.  I think a mana regen is important to our survival.  Last night I had to res 7 people.  That is 4900 mana.  It took me a very long time to med all that up even with clarity on.  Prayer doesn't have to be as good as clarity, but it would be nice that if it wasn't for it to stack.  And self only is very important.  I am praying, I am NOT making you pray. As it is stated in the strategy guides- "Clerics are not in your face about their religion.  They prefer to convert heathens by displaying their power and letting them chose."  I don't think this is a terrible issue of class balance either as long as it is a pre 50 spell, and you had a longer cast time on it, similar to the wizards harvest.  <P>Looking back at Turning of the Unnatural.  A 400 DoT is nice.  And it was put in at a good level.  My only qualm about it is that it takes over a minute to do the damage.  Well, by level 39, my battles tend not to last a minute unless I am running for my life.  So, I feel this spell was a flop.  Its easily remedied though, just make it faster.  At least then it might be useful.  <P>Why DO peridots need to cost 14pp?  Naltron is a great buff, but it isnt worth 14p.  <P>Death Pact- WHEN will it work? =)  I've never seen it work.  Do I really want to pay 5pp to see it not work?  Not really.  How about you switch the regent for that and Naltron ;)  <P>Shamans get a target yaulp type buff.  Why don't we get a target or a group one?  A blessing spell would be nice.  Why do we even need it?  We obviously can't melee at higher levels, and since we can't solo, its worthless.  It also doesn't stack with Armor of Protection.  I would rather have the extra hp than yaulp.  I don't think it would be that bad to have a group yaulp buff since  shamans never use theirs anyway.<P>As for cleric temple gate, I think its a great idea.  But, and there is always a but, I don't think it should replace evacs for group.  Or even for self.  What I think it should be is a way for us to get home.  Just a gate to a fixed point.  And make it a safe point.  DE clerics get Nek, HiE  Get Gfay, Dwarves get Butcher, etc etc.  Its not totally unreasonable if you made it level 39 perhaps.  By then wizards and druids have all of their group ports.  Just a nice single gate so we can go home and rest after a hard days work would be nice.<P>Pets pets.. hmm.  I do think rather than an attack type pet a healing pet would be useful.  I think a god should grant a cleric a little healing companion.  It would help share taunt, and it could do some healing.  Almost every class gets a pet now anyway.  But make this one relatively low, like 51-54 level spell, so at least its feasable to get, because if we don't start having more fun being a cleric, no one will see this pet.  Here is an idea.  Have the cleric cast a spell on a person that gives the cleric a little help that is set to  heal that person, ONLY while they are grouped.  This would prevent powerleveling.  Or at least make it a commandable pet if that is too hard.<P>Ah, FUN! I remember what that was.  It seems that after all this "balancing" has been going on, that all the classes are similar.  Well, why not make some classes different?  I'd like to beable to use my stuns at a high level.  Too bad that even with chanter MR debuffs they are still useless.  And even still, if I had a stun that worked when would I use it?  A group celestial healing would be nice for this.  At least then I can keep the group on check while I do something different.<P>Improving on spells we have would be a nice thing. <BR>Group AC buff.. where is that?  How about group resists.  Shaman's get it.  Why don't we?  At least for magic fire and ice?  Poison and disease too.  Maybe not for all, but some of those would be nice.  Making them a bit lower level wouldnt hurt either.  Realistically the only things that make us better than other classes is buffs and heals.  Why cant we go all the way with buffs for resists and ac?<P>Anyway, after all of this the MAIN issue with everyone is that we don't have fun being clerics anymore.  We have one job and only one job- heal.  The game could be made way more interesting for us with the addition of<P>-New spell messages<BR>-Improvement upon old spells.<BR>-Making new spells practicle.<BR>-Giving us a mana regen so that if we do get new abilities we will have mana to use them as well as heal.<BR>-Making prices for regent's reasonable.<BR>-Group buffs that are needed- ac and saves.  <BR>-An assitant healer or some sort of pet for variation.<BR>-A SAFE temple gate.  <BR>-Making the game fun for us instead of sit stand heal sit.<BR>-Surprise us with something NEW and Different. <P>Well, I know that I realistically will never see any of these, but maybe they'll one day, get done. <P>Alexandre Stromgold<BR>Vicar 51- almost 52<BR>Saryrn<BR>175 smith<BR>120 Brewer<BR>75 tailor <P>Have a nice day, and BOO JAH! =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Here is my take on clerics with respect to game balance:<BR>1-10 just as weak as everyone else at these levels.<P>11-35 underbalanced.  We have such a narrow focus.  We can do a few other things, buff (druid buffs are better, shaman's don't cost anything), stun, and hold our own against blue undead.  Necros get our undead line of DD and this is as it should be, Necros are, and should be, the masters of undead.  We heal slightly better than the other priestly classes, but 2 of them can out-heal us.<P>36-48 we are fairly balanced.  our abilities start to shine, we can finally heal better than 2 of the other priestly classes, we still have a very narrow focus of healing and res, as our nukes, even vs undead are less effecient though being the most effecient DD we have.<P>49+ we are still balanced.  The game at this level is very VERY unbalanced, esp Velious.  The resist rates of the mobs makes it such that the only effective method of killing mobs is Melee.  Every caster class has problems with fizzle rates, and with spells being resisted.  Velious is a hyperexample of this imbalance.  In an effort to give the 50+ crowd a challange by beefing up resistance and HP of the mobs, all classes save Warriors and Clerics are largely ineffectual, to the point of being neutered.<P>So, in my opinion, the only areas that need work are 11-34, and 49+.  Lets start with 49+.  When a Wiz can mana dump full DD nuke mode, and barely do a bubble of damage, things are imbalanced.  When magic based spells are rendered useless due to the high resitance of the mobs, Enchanters, Shaman, Druids, Magicians, and just about all other caster classes are a moot point and completly unnecessary.  So, what would bring these classes back in balance with Clerics and Warriors?  Lower fizzle rates, un-beef the HP of the mobs, and lower the resistances of mobs based on the area and type of mob.  There MUST be a way other than Melee to kill things at the end game other than melee, or War/Cle combo is the only effective method of hunting.<P>For the 11-34 area of the game, the limited role of clerics makes it difficult sometimes for them to compete for spots in groups.  For this range, i would think it wise to do a couple things.  I don't think that Clerics should have more abilities, anything done would probably blurr the class distinction boundaries, and that has gone far enough already.  Areas to think about would be a greater variety of healing abilties, add regen effects to the courage line, beginning at Daring 1hp per tick, and +1 hp per tick for each upgrade.  Or, this could be done to the Holy armor line beginning with Spirit Armor.  I see Clerics as being the opposite of Necromancers.  Whereas Necros focus on doing Damage over Time, it seems appropriate that Healing over Time would be a good addition to the Clerical arsenal.  <P>It would also be appropriate to either remove the component requirement of the Symbol line, or alter it such that the component costs more initially, but isn't consumed, similar to the Flame lick series.<P>Either make the Root and Lull series work, or just get rid of them.  I don't think it would be unbalancing to make the Lull Series AE the way Harmony is, and to keep the Enchanters advantage for this spell line, it could be that the cleric version is only castable indoors.  Root's resist rate is simply to high, and needs to be lowered dramatically.  Lull simply doesn't work.  When it fails to Lull them, you still get the message that they are less agressive.  Fix it or remove it.  I see that spell as being the stock and trade of Enchanters though, so I also think it would be fine to fix it and remove it from the Cleric class (i never could figure out why we got this line).<P>the summoned hammers past the level 9 version are rediculous.  Each upgrade (24 and 44) should give +2 damage and -2 delay from the previous spell (i.e. 24th would be 8dam, 30dly, 44th would be 10dam, 28 dly).  I could also see giving the 44 spell a small proc, but it should only be Ward Undead or other relativly small effect, but think it completely unnecessary.  Even given these changes, no cleric in their right mind would use these hammers on an ongoing basis as MUCH better weaps are available in the game at those levels, and would only be used to battle your way back to your corpse.  On this topic, can someone explain to me why a low level barb shaman quest results in an item who's effect is hammer of wrath?<P>I would really like a Prey or Bless ability, although i've not been able to think of what to make those abilities do that wouldn't be another class' ability.  Perhaps Bless could add 5 atk and 5 AC for every 50 skill points.  It would be nice if Prey doubled mana regen rate and could be used sitting or standing.  Standing it would be equal to med, sitting, it would be double the med rate.  Give it a 3-5 min duration, and 60-90 min re-use delay (similar to Lay on Hands delay).  I would love if you could train in these skills at level 20, but later would be ok too, past 40 would be to long though, in my opinion.<P>There also need to be several upgrades to Superior healing that do more hp but are not Complete healing and should be Cleric only.  I would also like to see, all along the line (from light healing on up), alternatives to the healing line that did less HP but were faster casting, and/or did more but had a longer cast time and longer delay.<P>I would like the Defence and Dodge cap to be 20 less than Paladins.  Not warriors, but Paladins.  We can wear full plate (even though Cleric FP items are lousy AC and way to heavy across the board), and our low HP would keep us from being able to tank, but we should at least have the AC and Skill to have a chance at dodging a blow or the mob missing us.  Our offensive melee abilities should not be touched.  <P>I think it appropriate that Shaman have the best cure poison and disease spells.  That makes perfect sense to me.  If you cave and give clerics abolosh, make it at least 5 levels after Shaman get it.  Alternatively, i think the Cleanse line would be a nice addition at the 29 level or so, with an upgrade at 39 and 49, rather than giving clerics abolish.<P>Remove our pet.  How the class blurr started at the 45+ level is beyond me, but fire the guy that said "hey, lets give all the non-pet classes pets!"  just can him, he's brain dead.  The same guy is probalby responsible for giving Wizards Invis to Undead, and Malosi to Mages.  Take him out back and smack him around some so he don't do it again, or just pink slip him.<P>While on the subject, you gotta do something to fix the class blurr thats been going on since the Kunark Expansion.  You've also gotta do something to fix the Mudflation that's been going on.  I know you wanna keep the game challenging for the Uberguilds, but you've made it such that parts of the game are restricted to everyone but Uberguilds.<P>Thats all i have time for right now, but that's my 2 coppers worth.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Greetings.<P>I see several distinct issues.  I'll try not to mix them  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>Defense - Clerics certainly deserve higher defensive skills and better armor than Shamen and especially Druids, which Clerics are lumped with in such matters.  Why?  The Cleric is more often closer to the fray.  We cannot do damage to our enemies while we move.  We can at best root, and that tactic by its nature leads to much more melee action than the other two classes have to see.  They are given the ability to largely avoid damage by way of not being swung at.  We need a commensurate ability to absorb the extra attacks we take, that we by design cannot avoid.  This needs to be balanced.<P>I suggest that a combination of Defense and Dodge increases, along with the Parry skill later in life, should be used.  There is no need for us to have such skills to the level of a Paladin, but there is need for us to have them at some level, more than we have now.  Some will disagree with the inclusion of Parry.  The needed changes could be made with Defense and Dodge by themselves I'm sure, adding Parry to the mix instead of a lot of Dodge would better fit my vision (:P) of a Cleric.  Too much of an inherent defense boost may be seen as unbalancing, but this might be handled with spells...<P>Combat Spells - <P>Yaulp is an interesting concept.  I'm not sure what Yaulp's intended purpose was, but I propose a variation.  When a cleric catches monster attention for what ever reason, it IS good to use a melee buff... but Yaulp's effect is inconsequential.  We need a spell that temporarily boosts ATK and AC, true, but it needs to be much stronger to justify its casting at later levels, and a slightly higher duration is also needed as the levels go by.  Because the effect would be more powerful than Yaulp, it should also be given a recast delay to prevent it being used multiple times in a single combat.  <P>I like the idea of curses.  It needs to affect something that won't interfere with an existing effect (Malosi comes to mind) and it needs to be worth casting.<P>Either of the above would make my combats more interesting.<P>Other spells/abilities - I read that Verant wanted to be careful with giving out abilities, because giving something to one class makes another want something to balance... etc.  Well, this is exactly what happened with the mana regen spells.  Since the other caster classes have now all gained such ability, it must be given to clerics also.  Please note that we clerics didn't create that situation :/<P>Terror Gate.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  I hope to see a quest for this appear so that I may teleport home and confer with the Masters in Paineel (at the Tabernacle of Terror, for those who are wondering).  If I sell/resupply while I'm there, why, so much the better!  Level 29 sounds about right.  I think we should have this ability through most of our careers.  I don't see that this ability should extend to my group.<P>Thank you for your attention.<P>All big words contained in the above were unintentional &lt;&lt;&lt; :P<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok your right clerics will still be able to get into groups after these new healing spells are added.  However, it will become a tidious fact like is right now for druids who are only taken for evac purposes if a wizard is not available.  Now druids will be able to get a group anytime they want cause you go from having your group of a Enchanter, Cleric, Shaman, Wizard(druid), Warrior, Rogue or Warrior....To having an enchanter, shaman, shaman, druid, warrior, warrior or rogue...shaman need no fixing they have no problem getting into groups as it is with slow spells and there stat adding spells, regen spells, dots and damage...druids do need some fixing but i cant really say how to do this besides to take away the kiting penalty necromancers can fear kite with no exp and its a lot easier to fear kite than it is to snare kite.<BR>As it stands now yaulp is worthless, atone is worthless, our area of effects are worthless and all of our right clickable items are worthless...CH once every ten minutes come on....and i remember you took the mana stone out of the game and said no item like it would ever be added again...baahhhhh....what you meant is that it made clerics too powerful......errr....i guess stopped dropping it....cause now freaking the mana robe off of trak...can be used by int classes....give this to a mage or necro oh my god...unstoppable....more powerful than a cleric could ever be.....what do clerics need...<P>well a group ac would be nice as well as maybe some new healing spell cause if you look at it now what makes a cleric is rez (cough paladins at 59 which there are a **** load) divine light well druids and shaman get regen series plus there own healing spell at 60, no one's considering giving clerics regen series even though as the best quote on quote healers in the game they should....<BR>and your going to say thats a different line of healing fine clerics should get there own line of healing that no other class should get...dont tell me group heal cause only word of vigor and restoration are even worth the mana...and really they need to be reduced....group complete heal doubt you'll ever see a cleric use that not only is it too exp all its good for is down time...how often do you see a chance to use this spell in battle.....i'm not saying that clerics need to be the most powerful class in the game but there defantly is a unbalance in the game....necros mages shaman and druid can all solo to 60<BR>warriors got reamed on the defense and offense ill give you that....but paladins and shadow knights are the former best of the best warriors in any freaking book you've read....they should be better rangers needed something to be done cause they had no possible way to get into a group....rogues really are pretty balanced they probably with the exception of monks should have the highest ac in the game cause they shouldn't get hit as much....freaking tumbling skills should be added for them. but any how many classes are unbalanced but mages and necros and warriors and shamans aren't.....clerics, druids, rangers, monks (no triple attack) and some others have taken the shaft for so long....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Balancing the Cleric. I am in a similar position to most other "old school" clerics...I am retiring  except for raids and guild rezing. why? one dimensional. Just about everything has been said here already but I wanted to post some ideas that I have that may in fact be possible and may change some of the dynamic of clerics.<P>New abilities. Treat these like you would like foraging/tracking/HT/LOH/disciplines or whatever.<P>divine might- get at level 30 and gives +1 strength per level and random proc one of our vs.undead spells. usable 1x per day for x duration. what will this do? This would add to a clerics attack rating. It really is depressing when I talk to my level 35 druid friend and he has the exact same attk rating as I do at 51. and he can buff his attack rating with two more spells. This gives us a few minutes/seconds where we can go forth and pound the wrath of god into a mob, at least slightly better than we could before. Gives us a reason to use a hammer instead of a pearl kedge totem or paw.<P>Divine Focus- like previously stated as a mana regen self only. Give it at 40. usable 1x per 12 ga me hours or something. x duration of fast mana regeneration. Think of it as a surge of power from the God you worship. good for emergency heal or bad situation but not overall unbalancing in a continual usage perspective.<P>Divine Rage- Self only damage shield. usable 1x per 12 game hours. give it at 50. x duration. good damage shield (35-50?). Why? good for soloing and combat situations. those times when you cannot get the damned mob off of you and cannot sit and med. use this and take a chunk out of the mob. sometimes you just have to stand there and take a beating after casting a heal or two on a bad pull, at least this way, combined with divine might you can damage a mob in some small way instead of standing there useless until someone can mez it or taunt it.<P>anyways, these are just basic ideas that add a little dynamic to the cleric class as a Holy Crusader (why else would we wear plate and carry a weapon). I am sure that much better ones can be thought of but this is just an idea. Other ideas like this would be like an Area Effect Aura of Power. kinda like the way some area bard songs work... when it is active it would be like divine inspiration or something. like a group damage shield vs undead that stacks with other damage shield. you just need to be in range of the cleric or something like that. A group Yaulp spell based on area would be good as a divine inspiration.<P>these ideas are just some basics for giving the cleric more to do, a little help with the combat usefulness, solo abilities, etc. No new spells. Just new abilities that are a clerics alone and are designed as divine powers. We do not worship animal spirits or nature or trees, we worship specific gods and get our powers from them. Ideas like this are not unbalancing and add some flavor.<P>take it as you will.<P>Vilaraa Innoruuk<BR>Vicar of Innoruuk<BR>Almost Retired Priestess on Innoruuk Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor:<BR>I believe I have a solution to this whole Backup Healer solution.  First, as a cleric I don't mind seeing Shamans and Druids be decent SECONDARY healers.  The changes done to Shamans and Druids are good in my opinion.  Perhaps even more healing power can be given to them, so they can be more effective backup healers.<P>To address the balance issue though, I submit to you that clerics have a problem with a line of spells that can be addressed in order to give clerics more variety, and make them useful for 1 more purpose over healing, and that would be the calm line of spells.  How about reducing resists so that they are basically unresistable against even and blue mobs, and resist less against yellows.  That would involve clerics more in breaking spawns, make them able to fill in as a "backup" harmony puller.  It would also allow us more options to get through dangerous areas to do rezzes for others.<P>Please respond if this might get on the list.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well I have read all four pages of this thread and given my class a lot of thought. I have played my cleric for 3 years now and whilst I get bored with the class, never have I played a game for 3 years before. I think ..<P>Clerics are pretty close to perfect.<P>Yes they need to tweak some of the spell fizzle rates and mana costs of some of our spells but my problem isnt "I dont have this spell or that spell", my problem is I am not efficient enough on big raids. <P>Lets face it pre-50 clerics rock, nothing can replace them in a group, and dont feed me crap about druids/shamans, yes they can fill in sometimes, but never replace the cleric as the primary healer. We get great heals, awesome stuns, Divine Aura (Gift of the gods) and the best buffs in the game. Pre-50 the perfect class.<P>For those of you who feel they have it hard at 15-29, hang in there, those classes like druids and necromancers have REAL problems post 50, go read their threads and realise the pay offs, we are slow starters but come home strong :)<P>Post 50 is where we have more problems, fizzle rates on spells are crap, we cannot afford to loose 350mana on fizzles in a bar of mana. Our Stuns suddenly become resisted like crap to the point were we mostly dont bother. My standard spell list is usually ;<P>heal - Remedy<BR>heal - Divine Light<BR>heal - Complete Heal<BR>stun - Depends on cast speed required<BR>root - Crowd control<BR>group heal - Usually Word of Vigour<BR>gate - Can we say RUN!<BR>DA 1 - My best friend<BR>DA 2 - If i have to use this were in trouble.<P>** Peridots **, please drop the cost of these, it really hurts to spend 4-6k on peridot per raid, with Dispells and 30-40 people to buff, peridots get chewed up real fast. I sell every bit of loot I get to cover the costs of raids, and now most of the SoV stuff is no drop and dont drop gems, im selling anything i can get hands on. <BR>You are forcing the high levels back into the low-mid dungeons to farm for PP items so we can aford to go the places were meant to be.<P>Please drop the cost of peridots or give us a decient HP buff that uses a cheaper reagent.<P>So in closing dont give us more, make what we have more effective by making it possable to do our job more efficently. <P>Domanic<BR>Cleric od Tarew Marr<BR>Clan of Shadows</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I note in the list you now give for clerics you left off bash, which you previously said you did have on the list.  Please re-add it.  It fits the class (shield-bearing and semi-melee), is not so powerful as to be unbalancing, but gives us something new and fun to do.<P>As for balance, you're not hearing much now, because we are currently balanced above 34th.  Up the healing of shamans and druids, though, and you *will* throw us out of balance.  Point: 2 shaman already both help a group (one slows, one heals/buffs/nukes), 2 druids already help a group (both heal/dot).  2 clerics--the 2nd cleric is no help to the group.  Give us something to add to the group as a 2nd cleric--*slightly* lower resists on our stuns--with 5 stun spells, we are the masters of stuns, whatever the other classes think.  Anything to make a 2nd cleric useful.<P>And for god's sake, address the issue of high level cleric item drops--I've been in KC for 4 months now, and I've seen armor/weapons drop for casters, shaman, druids, pallies, warriors, sk's, monks, and rangers--i.e., every class except cleric.  I'm a 54th cleric who's been in kc and os since level 46 and the last item I looted I could use was a mith bp in solb at 44th.  And for god's sake, also, consider in the future having the same mobs that tank stuff also drop healer/caster stuff--they pull and we don't, give them a reason to pull something we might get a drop off of, on the common mobs not just the uber ones.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I read a bunch of posts on what people want added to the cleric class and I got to say a lot of them are ludicrous and stupid.  Most of the suggestions would be really cool if implented but are not really needed.  Although there are a few things that I would really enjoy seeing.  I love playing the cleric class and it's the only character that I have that is above 20.  <P>As far as giving Druids/Shamans improved heals I say THANK BRISTLEBANE!  If I had a nickel for everytime I wanted to log and gotobed so badly but I didn't because I knew my leaving would be the end of a group and I didn't want to let down 5 other people.  Unless I have a tank with massive hps taking dmg at a slow pace I don't really use CH, instead I choose the remedy/divine light/celestial healing route.  Giving other classes this option lets me leave and not feel like a jerk.<P>Prayer - This sounds like an awesome addition only if it is used like the wizard harvest spell.  How great would it be to yell OOM and then 10 seconds later still be able to throw a few more heals.  If a druid or mage or something runs out of mana they can just sit back and watch but if a cleric runs out of mana people die.<P>Regeneration - Maybe it's just because I'm a manastone junky...but I would love to see clerics get some sort of regeneration.  I can give you back all of your hitpoints at once (well..10seconds) but I can't give em back realllly slow.  I think if we are the masters of healing we should be able heal at 10hps a tick or so.  <P>Group-AC buff - Group hero...group Naltron...group AC.  It just fits ya know?<P>Invis - This would be really nice but you know what it's not really needed.  If you give us invis then druids would complain that they need invis to undead.  I've gone 52 levels without it I don't really need it now.<P>Med while standing - I don't get it....at all.  Does this mean when someone gets hit I could immediately cast instead of the .3 seconds it takes to stand up?  Really I would much rather see Regen and Prayer go through before this.<P>Self-Port to Temple - Wow would it be great to be able to buy symbol regents and food/drink without having to bug a druid or a wizard. However....not needed.  If they give us this then everyone will start whining about some kind of way to RP a self port home.  I personally think every caster should get a level 50 self port back to hometown. IE halflings can port back to rivervale and etc.  Make it a quested item so it is not easily to get...and once you get the quest you can't do it again.  That way Half-Elves could do the quest once for whichever city they want to go back to.<P>Besides Regen/Prayer I think clerics are a great and balanced class.  I knew what I was getting into when I made it...clerics = heal. Gotcha.  I don't want to be able to nuke something to death....I'm not a wizard.  We have the undead handsdown which makes sense.  Our buffs are good I don't really see a need for change (besides the MoK issue...I'm not high enough to have it so I can't voice on it but the general consensus seems to be that it should be un-nerfed).  <P>P.S. Absor...I hope you don't look at all the silly postings (like asking for an ice-comet undead and be medding while running around or anything) and take the real ones into concideration.  I'm not going to drop the class entirely if we don't get regen or prayer 'cuz like I said I love it...it would just make me excited again about jumping online.<P>~Moffon Furryhealer...Halfling for Hire.<BR>52 Vicar  Rallos Zek (the only Real Server Boyee)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Clerics do need some tweaking to adjust there class, one of the big points is the low mid levels ie 9-13 19-23 29-33 at these various points it is better to have a druid or shaman with a group than a cleric for the simple flexability of there spell choices.  A cleric at these levels is using the same heal spells as the druid or shamn will have.  One option would be to give clerics their new heal spell the same level that the other class gets the old heal spell.<P>Second thing that needs to be considered is what is the point of Revive, after level 29 noone wants a no experiance res do to the experiance penalties after the first hell level, Revive should be a level 19 spell when people just want to get back to the group and are not worried about the lost experiance, by 29 the res should give some experiance back.<P>Third point is if a symbol spell has to have a componet, why does the componet have to be consumed? how about a quest for a permenant componet for each symbol? or if not that a reduction in the cost of the componets.  or another option is to triple the duration of the spells.<P>Fourth point the only useful spell in the hammer line was hammer of wrath because it allowed you to hunt wisps at 9th level, all of the later spells hammer of striking and hammer of requittel were just a waste of a spell slot.<P>Only other thing i can suggest is try to add something to clerics besides med heal, the idea of just having the mana come back at meditating rates for clerics due to there devotion to there god would at least allow clerics to join in the fight and help (lol), and would beat sit stand cast sit wash and repete</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Clerics are one of the better balanced classes in the game.  Only thing i can see improvement on is or group abilities.  As a Cleric we depend on groups for just about our whole carrer.  Our Group healing spells are a joke.  Too much mana to lil healing  to far apart to be useful.<P>By the time we get our first Group healing spell it barely does anything for the casters in the group.  It would help to get them earlier and spaced less far apart.  Maybe we should get a Group Celestial Heal  would be nice   cost about 700-800 mana to cast.  Group Conteract blindness, Poison, Disease  wouldnt hurt ethier<P>with these skills we could be better set apart from our healing counterparts and maybe it would make up for the lack of us not having a simple regen spell.<P>Dagna BattleHammer<BR>45th Cleric of Brell<BR>The Lush of Xegony, CLAW</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I played a Dwarven cleric on Prexus as my primary character from the time i started EQ till i quit.(my cleric reached 52 my next highest character was 12th) I just thought i'd leave my own 2 cents for the clerics continuing on. Here are a few things i always wanted to see Clerics be able to do...<P>1. Summon bandages: It just always seemed to me that this spell would have fit well in the clerics spell list at some point.<P>2. Divine Aura upgrades: If i remember correctly (BIG IF its been a while since i heard this) Bards get a group DA at 60th, so why not clerics too... also, what about a targetable DA at some point. Would give the clerics another option when it comes to saving the lives of the rest of the group.<P>3. New Class Ability TURN UNDEAD: This is a classic ability of clerics in the fantasy genre. While many will probably say that our fear undead line of spells replace this, i have always felt that its just not the same as having it as a class ability. Finding a good way to implement this ability is probably why Verant didn't include it in the first place, and the best I personally could come up with would be a PBAoE undead only Mez or Stun, or a fear and mindwipe effect (undead only of course). It would just be nice to have a class ability that has always seemed missing from the cleric class down there on the ol' skill bar.<P>4. Wisdom Buffs: Call it Divine Insight or something, but I don't see this spell being unbalancing or stealing from another class (chanters can do plenty and i am sure wouldn't mind us being able to Wis buff ourselves...)<P>5. Bash or Parry(call it shield parry if you think it matters) Skill: I always thought Clerics should put that shield on their arm to better use somehow.<P>6. Throwing(blunt) Skill: We can throw those rusty hammers we find laying around everywhere, so why not let us get some skill at it. Maybe even make our summoned hammers throwable (pointless but perhaps give an otherwise useless line of spells some token entertainment value).<BR>Nothing like goin to the noob zones and takin potshots at orc pawns while you buff/bind people. =)<P>7. See Invisible: Shamans get a spell called Spirit Sight(or something like that) that would be good for clerics too, being able to see ghosts helps to combat them imho. I dont think clerics should get invis personally, but i do like the idea of some non-combat spell that increases movement (like the Angel Form mentioned above) so not every res run, runs the risk of multiple resses (no pun intended).<P>Ok, that said I take my leave of the EQ world once again. I hope that the Clerics of Norrath that continue on after me get the balance and enjoyment they seek<P>Loknar Stonecrusher<BR>52nd Cleric of Brell<BR>Formerly of the Prexus Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055974-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055974.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055974-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055974-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055974-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055974&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055974&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
