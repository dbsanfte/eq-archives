</FONT><HR>Well I dont understand why people are posting who have not even tried the change.  This really hurts the rest of us.<P>Yes his change was huge.  Yes I am dying.  Do you need to change it back? No Actually I dont think you do.  However, going through the interesting days since the change I have come up with some ideas to help out us clerics (and im speaking for post 50 myself).<P>First off, increase our defense skill cap. Let us be able to stand up to the punishment we are taking.  A higher defense skill would help a ton.  One to obviously increase AC, but two to appease those of us that came from D&D and played clerics and thats why we do now.  Stepping closer to what a cleric should be in a way. Not the folding house of cards we are now.<P>Second add another DA spell to the line, the two I have isnt cutting it anymore... im regularly cycling through them both.  Or even cutting the cycle time on the spells down.  15 mins now is meaning death.<P>Third, atone.  This is a great time to make this spell shine for clerics (not just powering someone).  However the casting time on this spell is so high that it is not useful during battle.  Perhaps introduce a new spell (mem blur type) and make the casting time much faster.<P>All 3 of these changes, I think should only happen post 50.  The defense cap, the cycle time of the DA's and the new atone spell.<P>So I say, im enjoying what you threw at us verant.  Now lets see some changes to clerics that make us happy and keep this new challenge in game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I can't connect sometimes which is when I haunt these message boards and read the posts from all the classes not just my own (ranger). The warriors/enchanters/clerics in this thread say that everything was fine before the patch and the cleric being nerfed. They also mention Verant not taking any notice of their customers.<P>All i can say about this is that if you read the other class threads you would see ENDLESS complaints about how difficult finding groups is for the non-specialist classes past level 50.<P>This seems to me to be the problem Verant is trying to fix. None of this is relevant to my level but if the complaints in the other class threads about /ooc LFG for hours to no effect are right. (And all you 50+ clerics/warriors will know if you ignored certain classes when filling spots or not). If the complaints from the other classes are accurate then Verant had no option but to listen to the bulk of the players and try to change the tactics used 50+ to make other classes neccessary.<P>All i would say is that whether or not the patch change was a mistake a lot of the 50+ players with the non-specialist classes were complaining pretty strong about the way things were.<P>For example if the patch changes had made it neccessary for a backup healer who was not a cleric (druid/shaman) and also for backup tanks who were better at taunting than warriors (hybrids) then it would have pleased the other classes without hurting anybody else.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan,<P>Many thanks for proving me wrong with some of my comments (which I made very late at night), you made me smile, its nice to know that you are reading. I cannot deny that heal agro was a little low before on CH etc. I also do not envy you reading as many as you can Ive spent all morning working through this thread alone. Respect is due for that, and thanks for your efforts. I dont envy the position Verant is in with balancing EQ, I have discussed this with friends, and I would no struggle with finding the common ground with many issues EQ has. I digress.<P>I do think however that our ability to "adjust" to this very sudden change is limited by our related spell repetoire. Clerics main abilities in my view, are heals, buffs, stuns. <P>Enchanters now seem from experience compulsory for my survival, which I didnt believe was the desired goal of the team? There is also the problem of pulling other mobs even from other groups (some poor guy got accusedof kill stealing just by healing a group member in kunark recently). In Karnors in places, a CH seems to pull trains from floors below as well. Its these little oddities that make it so hard to work with, not the effect in an individual encounter. I havent tried an "uber" mob yet so I cant comment. I can almost see a situation where lots of clerics just CH each other to keep uber mobs ping ponging around between clerics whilst everyone else get stuck in with no risk.<P>Ok in an average encounter post change I see the following as my options.<P>I get agroed, I have very little time to react to this problem, and of course the resists in many place mean I cant often use my spells to get around this. I cant realistically hold out for long I dont really have the hps to do it nor the defensive capability.<P>My options how I see it are this<P>Tank and hope I get the mob pulled off, doesnt seem to happen since the change, once its on its seems stuck on until one of your dies.<P>Options to get away?<P>Flash of Light: Quick cast, Blind them, back off, they hit whoever it closest or run off randomly. Ok thats good, as long as its only 1 and it holds. With any cleric more than one spell, and its going to get interrupted. Im finding that now when I use a heal I get more than one on me, even pulling from other places. How can I deal with this? This is cheap and quick, prob one of the better options, unless you are in a tight space.<P>Root: Again can work, though I find without someone taunting off me I cant always get this one off. <P>Atone: Simply takes too long to cast, can be used with Root but of course as soon as more than 1 mob, interrupted. Also find past about level 40 that it takes upto 5 or more casts to get any effect from it. Not really an option then.<P>DA/DB: Good spells, I love them, but the 15 min recast time means this is the option first time around then for 15 mins its not an option. I think this also anti-taunt, though now mobs seem to continue beating even with the invuln going.<P>Stuns: Can give time to get that root off, although often by the time my spells have refreshed, and the next spell is cast Im already being interuppted again, even with chanelling in the region of 200.<P>Problem there is most of my spell slots would be gone and Id have very few left for heals. The group has always been responsible for keeping me safe.<P>What I mean by all this rambling is I would have no problem with the changes, if I had means of dealing within my grasp, without an enchanter, or using more of my mana on self preservation than healing. Of course then when I heal myself I get agroed more  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> I seem to have the potential means for sure, no doubt about it, but in practice they dont quite seem to work when Im being beaten, for me at least. Again I rely onthe party, and the way things work, they dont seem able to get the tenacious mobs off me. <P>I've just arrived in hate, I will be interested to see how this place changes with the new agro. Will I pull mobs from miles around with a CH like I seem to in Karnors? Will it not be a problem due to the way we pull? Ill wait and see and draw my conclusions then.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One of the things I don't understand about healing aggor, and all aggro in general, is why monsters of different intelligences react to aggro the exact same way.<P>For example, a wild animal should never chase somebody who is backing off if other people are beating on him.  An animal doesn't want to kill you, it wants to escape with it's life so if you back off it should attack the next guy.<P>I also think things like racial enmity should play a role too.  Darks elves should have natural mega aggro to High Elves and reverse.  They should have less aggro to other DEs.  It just seems to make sense.<P>Too much of the mob AI centers around 1 desire, the mob does not care if it dies.  The mob is not fighting to win or to get away.  The mob is figting to kill at least one guy in your group even at the cost of it's own life.  Have mobs that mega aggro on healing, medding, or low health is proof of this.<P>No sentient being would allow himself to be beat on for 3 minutes while he chased a 95% dead enemy trying to get a death blow.  It's damned silly.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"Having monsters nearly ignore the fact that there is a healer restoring the life to its enemies is wrong, both in terms of consistency within the game world and for the mechanics of the AI."<P>Yeah, because you know, overall, EQ is just SO CONSISTENT.  Having monsters not get stunned by getting kicked in the HEAD by a Monk's Flying Kick is wrong, having monsters that sure look like plants and trees invulnerable to DEFOLIATION is wrong, having monsters nearly ignore the fact that there is a Warrior TAUNTING them is wrong.

I dont understand why cleric's are getting nerfed so badly is it just to try and keep customers playing longer ?This new heal agro at 56 is such a joke . I can understand giving druids , and shamans better heals ,but then to nerf our compete heal like that .Try to remember clerics cant solo we dont have snare ,dots,or even slow .

</FONT><HR>Well I know I do not care for the new hate list.  I have had it get me killed several times already that I feel were not truly fair.  The first time I was in The Hole.  I was with about 20 people.  They pulled 5 of the rock golems.  The fight was proceeding well until I cast Remedy.  It was the only spell I cast and 3 of the 5 mobs agroed on me and I died fairly quick.  This isn't so bad since most everyone else was concentrating on one mob so I let it slide.  Then the other day I helped on a rogue epic quest, trying to kill the general in Kith.  They had beat down the general to just above half life when I cast my first spell of the combat.  I cast celestial healing on a monk in my group.  I was standing a ways back but the general charged me.  With how he hits there was no hope for me and I instantly died.  I felt that was a very unfair example of the new hate.  I waited until almost half way into the fight to cast one heal.  How am I suppose to do anything useful in combat if I have to wait even longer to cast one heal in raid situations just to keep myself alive?  I don't mind you upping agro but to me it seems you have gone a bit far.<P>Borenson Thesped<BR>51 cleric</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Give us a detailed blow by blow, click by click example of why the old mechanics are wrong and how the new method (again very detailed) fixes it.<P>This post reflects a general problem with Verants "Fixes" of EQ.  Often (almost always) is not made clear to us the player as to why certain changes must be implemented which weaken the PC or make playing more mechanically difficult.  This is why reaction to these changes are so negative.  To us it appears that these changes are made on the whim of the EQ staff sort of like "hey I think clercs dont get argoed enough when healing lets increase the argo." <BR> We would be much more confident if we were shown in deatail how an X level cleric using compleate heal teamed with an y level warrior and take daown boss z over anbd over for mad xp and power level themselves 1 level per hour- or somethin like that that would clearly make a better argument than-"we dindnt indend this, its not the vision, we took many things we are not telling you about into account etc.. "<P>In the end we all want changes that make us the PCs more powerful not weaker.  EQ PCs are pitifully weak as it is, It it wasnt for the online aspect of multiplayer EQ would simply be a hack and slash with weak PCs and pitiful loot (thats another issue very few if any item in the game actually make you powerful compared to mobs but we will put that aside for now)<BR>--------------------------------------<BR>Take home messege from this short post gone long.<P>If you want to nerf us -give us a  well stated, detailed and very specific set of reasons why. Support it with full battle screen shots and text logs of what is happening and why it is bad.

</FONT><HR>Well, we took on Overking Balthezed with the new aggro, and it definitely requires a change in the style of healing.  Our pull cleric probably died once to heal aggro, another cleric who does CH almost exclusively took it on the chin.  I was ressing him after pretty much every 4 or 5 pull.<P>I was lucky, i only aggroed the King late in the fights, after using Celestial Heal on the tanks for a start, and then following up with a CH later in the fight.  The tanks did a great job of sharing the aggro, but the king did summon me 3 times in that fight.<P>It was actually his cronies that took me out though  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>All in all, with some minor changes in tactics, and actually USING DA and DB instead of having them memmed and never needing them, a clerics lot in life is not too much worse than it was pre-patch.<P>All i ask is that they address the other issues in the forum.<P>Guidar<BR>56th Templar<BR>Companions of the Gate</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor said<P>"Actually, you are incorrect. The maximum healing of the spell is never looked at, only the points actually healed."<P>Hmm, I don't know about this one, I have many a time tossed a heal onto a perfectly healthy druid who was busy PLing me to taunt the mobs onto myself so the damage shield I'm wearing can kick their butt.  If the heal did little or nothing (as was the case, since the druid had gotten hit once for 20 damage) then my greater heal should not have acted like a taunt and pulled them off of him and onto me.<P>Ok, I didn't say that the best way, but end result is I think you are incorrect in how you are stating heal works.  I taunt mobs onto myself (purposely sometimes) by casting a greater heal onto the target of the mobs aggresion, even when that character is perfectly healthy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>IMHO (think thats in my honest opinion)<BR>If casters/healers (clerics and enchanters and the like) should get agroed/hated so easyly, then players should be able to employ defensive tactics. Such as 4 warriors or tanks should be able to soround or get in the way of a mob to protect their caster/healer. Today thats not possible cause the mobs just go thru you as you didnt even exist. If you soround (i know its misspelled) a mob he simply goes thru you like thin air and attacks the caster. No means of defending them. Well i guess we should be able how to use different tactics to defend our casters but there arent any, anyone who played RPG´s knows that usually the casters stays behind while the warriors and such are in the front like a wall to defend the casters. Hmm i prolly repeat myself a lot but thats because i have my skill in writing english is feeble =).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Regardless or whether these changes are major or minor nerfs according to what you are doing, they are still nerfs.  They are responses to what verant sees as the game becoming too 'easy'.  Of course, since not a single person involved in these decisions has the same emotional investment we, the Customers, have in our characters, they dont care that it upsets us.  They understand that we get upset, they just dont care.  <P>And for those that dont understand why they actually contrive of ways to make our in-game progress harder.........<BR>The reason for every last nerf put in by verant is to delay us, the Customer, from reaching whatever in-game goals we have.  The reasoning is: The longer verant can keep the Customer from reaching his goal ( and maybe quitting ) the more money they can make.  After all, its alot cheaper to just nerf players than it is to actually add content to keep them interested.  I'm sure it wasnt cheap to produce the 2 expansions.  Im sure it took about 1% of that expense to come up with every nerf they've ever done since the first beta.  <P>It's a business decision.  Every last thing they've done is a business decision.  verant is a BUSINESS.  I can respect that.  What I can't respect is the way they lie to us about what they do.  I find it insulting that they actually think I would believe the drivel they come up with to justify their nerfs. <P>All the hungry and ambitious MMORPG companies out there are probably watching and laughing at verant.  I also hope they're learning from verant's mistake.  <P>You, verant, wont be the only game in town forever......<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I play a 53 cleric, have played a lot since this change took effect and the only difference I see is that I wait a little longer before sitting down, I keep both DAs up, and maybe if room, Atone.  I've fought in icewell keep against the dorfs, and there has been times where we got 2 dorfs, and all that saved me after I healed was a DA.  But it's not a bad thing, keeps me on my toes a lot more than before.  The other day, I went to Velk's Lab and died once or twice, while my groupmates died like 4 or 5 times.. Not saying I'm a bad cleric, we were in a new area, and it took a few deaths to learn how to pull, learn what we could handle, etc.  But I didn't have a problem at all with the healing aggro.  Maybe the tank was really good at taunting...maybe I knew how long before I could sit down again.  Maybe other tanks aren't continously taunting and that's why the aggro switches to cleric and they get pounded..  I haven't had a problem with it yet.  And I've learned how to deal with it.  Course this does not include any boss mob encounters.  I'll have to wait and see how that goes when the time comes.<P>Kethryn e'Lanya<BR>53 Vicar of Mith Marr<BR>Mortis Consortium</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan,<BR>  ever since this patch went into effect it has been next to impossible for my group too keep the MOBs on us, even with a tank with maxed out taunt and a rogue backstabbing and not evading. Anything more than a double pull means certain death for our cleric, and that isnt fun for any of us.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't see why so many players are saying this change is bad.  When I play other games such as Chrono Trigger and the Final Fantasy series, I always go for the enemies with healing spells first.  I only change that strategy when killing the attacker first will shorten the battle.  Why should it be any different for EverQuest?<BR>The same thing goes for a war.  If you are fighting a large army, go for their supply lines first.  Again, why should it be different for EverQuest?<P>Instead of changing the healing/hate equation, I ask for Verant to listen to the requests of our tanks.  My cleric is a secondary, my warrior is my primary.  So many times, like many other warriors, I wish I could throw myself between the mob and my healer to literally become the "meat shield" that I am.  Can the physics of the game be changed to accomodate this?  When I stand between a mob and my healer, I want to be a literal shield:  The mob has to knock me down or go around me.  Right now the mob can run right through me, as if my character occupies extremely little volume in space.<P>Now expand this theory:  You have a line of tanks beating on the mob.  The mob would either have to beat down one of the tanks to go through the wall, or have to move around the whole wall to get to the healer.  This would change nothing as far as class balance.  This would simply be a revamp in the physics of how game objects occupy 3D space.<P>If the physics is too great of a project, please continue to look into improving the taunting and damage abilities of the warriors.  Of all the classes, we are the most dependent on our "supply lines": the healers.  Wouldn't it make sense that we would do everything in our power, including acts of desperation, to keep our healers alive?<P>I realize this is a cleric post, but I just thought of an idea for the warrior class balance.  Perhaps give warriors an innate skill - innate being defined as an "always on" skill such as Parry and Dodge - which increases the perceived threat we impose on mobs.  This wouldn't affect damage dealt in any way, but would increase the urgency the mob feels about killing the warrior first.<P>Am I alone on this opinion, or are others with me?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well I have some experiences I'd like to pass on while fighting in KC pre and post patch.<P>PRE:  Able to hold my own using celestial and complete as needed.  Had mobs agro me but after 50 levels I was used to this and handled it effectively.<P>POST:  I did not notice much of a change in the way mobs aggro using celestial heal.  HOWEVER, when using any direct heal spell the reaction was quite a bit different.  One superior heal got me aggro'd by a mob that was a bit stubborn about being taunted off.  Also whenever a mob was mezzed and I used a direct heal, when mez broke the enchanter was completely safe because I was the main focus of its ire.  <BR>It was posted somewhere that you should move away from mezzed mobs when healing.  I decided to try this tactic out.  It doesn't work.  Mobs still loved to come play tag-the-cleric with me.<P>I've also read that this fix only effects the TARGET if they are 51+.  Well I totally disagree with this.  While in KC we pulled the Knight of Sathir.  This is a level 51+ mob who loves to summon.  Our groups main puller was a level 50 warrior.  When he returned with this mob (and 2 of his buddies) I had no choice but to cast complete heal as he was almost dead.  This immediately sealed my doom.<BR>I was summoned as soon as the heal landed and all three mobs wanted my hide for their collection.  I attempted (key word) to cast my divine series but to no avail.  EVERYONE else was doing their jobs as well; enchanter tried to mez, warrior taunted, mage nuked but I still was reading "loading please wait..." in under 10 seconds.  <P>This change has made a huge impact on the way I play my main character now.  AND YES! my main character is my cleric and will continue to be so.  I'll just have to keep my eyes open to any new developments or try to group with another cleric from here on out.<P>Greywolffe<BR>(anxiously awaiting a change)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Playing in plane of growth last night with about 35 ppl...6 of which are cleric (one wasnt fighting was just there hanging out and chatting due to faction reasons), when all of a sudden we get a pretty big pull.  Well my guild is pretty good and not too affraid of big things.  This pull included about 6 wolves, a couple of ferals and sylvain prots.  We used to be able to handle this stuff no problem at all really because we have played with eachother for a long time and everyone knows their roles and what to do.  Needless to say...we lost 5 ppl on that pull.  <P>Those 5 ppl were the clerics.  Not the puller, not the enchanter, not the tanks taunting and kicking the crap out of the mob.  But the healers.  If we didnt have the one non-kos healer with us to res the dead clerics after the fight, we might have been in a bind for a while.  <P>Im not flaming Verant for screwing anything up or anything, im just bringing my experiences with the new hate changes to the table for everyone to see.  Maybe some tuning to the new hate changes should be looked into a little bit, because when all that dies are the clerics...and thats basically whats been changed with hate lists is agro from healing...then maybe something isnt quite working as intended.<P>Just my two coppers<P><BR>          Immortalis<BR>Warlord of the Coterie Nocturne<BR>           Ayonae Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 9 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=061314&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=061314&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
