</FONT><HR>Well, here's an issue that just popped up -- the nerfing of the HT refresh on PvP servers. Bind point rushing ONLY happens at low levels (mainly in Nektulos that I've seen). Besides, realistically, how many zones can SKs bind rush from? Maybe 6 or so. So this seems like more of a PvE change than a PvP one. If for some reason VI REALLY thinks that bind point rushing is an issue (and at higher levels, I have NEVER EVER seen a SK bind rush), MAYBE a 5 minute refresh after deaths would be more in line with what is needed. There have been more than a few times where I HTed a mob to save a caster, died, and needed to use HT again on my way to my body.<P>I also don't like the damage reduction much, but I saw it coming. I think 12% is a bit much, but maybe once all the classes are tuned, this will make more sense.<P>Other than that, I have the usual concerns -- naked gankers, portal campers, the uselessness of enchanters at high level, etc etc.<P>Baltiscan.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>To be honest Absor, you guys have done a great job with the balance of PvP.  The biggest problem now that I see is Looting.  I have played on Rallos since 3 weeks of its making and I ahve seen some big changes.  I like alot of the changes and I dislike alot of the changes, but over all things are going quit well as far as balance.  Looting on the other hand is out of control.  People zone camp, druid/wizard ring camp all the time taking valuable equipment.  People will tell me to switch server if I dont like the way the server is, but its not that I dont like the way the server is, its the way the people exploite and gang rape others for items.  The PvP part rules!  I feel if you take away looting, the exploits will stop and camping druid/wizard rings would stop as well.  Why?  Because they can gank an item, it would be pointless for them to wait on people to TP in or zone in to get a few copper.  If in fact people play on Rallos for PvP, they shouldnt give a rip if they cant loot something.  (Remember its about PvP not items)  I hope this help you guys at Verant.  I realy think you would not hear as many complants about PvP if people didnt loose the gear they worked so hard for.<P>Just my 2cp  <BR>(Bring on the Flames)  =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

If you slay your own kind make it so that there is a small faction hit to the point where you wont be invited in felwithe if you are a high elf who kills too many High Elves.<P>Magic Resistance.  Enchanters have a hard time trying to battle wizards who at lvl  52 eat your face off with those fast firebase spells.  I can have my fire vs up to 130 and still get hit for 300+ damage 3-5 times.  Give us a better tash spell lvl 51-52.

</FONT><HR>I have played on PvP since VZ came out, took a 7 month break after VI pissed me off w/ coin only, cancelling the server transfer, and then pumice nerf.<P>Ways to fix pvp are as follows:<BR>1) Give looting rights on corpses. If my group gets the kill, my group should get to loot the corpse. Ninjalooting was a big problem w/ item loot, and is still a problem with coin loot.<P>2) give faction hits to everyone who helps kill the person, wether its heals, buffs, or direct damage. At this point only the person who gets the final hit gets the faction hits, not everyoen else in the group, or the immortal healer. This will put immortal healing to a stand still, noone would want to interfere if they are gonna be taking faction hits.<P>3) Reduce the damage of HT in PvP.<P>4) Make it so that casters can't cast through walls in pvp.<P>5) NERF THE REGEN TUNIC'S IN PVP! Make the regen effect level based. A level 10 with a fungi tunic is unkillable by anything but an army.<P>6) Put fear and charm back in pvp and fix the bugs they caused.<P>7) Give lower casting time on egg shaped pumice or give pure melee's an ability to cast them so that only a bash would intterupt. A pure melee trying to cast egg shaped pumice can get intterupted when hit for 1 damage because they have no channeling skills whatsoever, give them equivalent channeling skills of hybrids so that this doesn't happen.<P>8) Fix faction in surefall glade. They are linked to half elves, although on team PvP server it is a purely human starting town.<P>9) Make counterbalances on the faction. Killing enemy teams should rasie faction with your team.<P>10) Give us solid pvp rules for everyone to follow, tired of having guides that don't know pvp rules. On VZ only 2-3 guides out of the whole program have any clue about pvp, and i've been told by a guide that he doesn't even like pvp. Guides on a pvp server should be players that PvP!<P>11) Reduce the amount that spells rely on levels and put more emphasis on resist gear. If the person is 8 levels above you, no matter how good your resists are, 90% of the time your not going to resist.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>/cheer Absor<P>Oh dear lord, where to start....<P>In my opinion there are three main areas of improvement that pvp players desire, BUGS/TWEAKS, BALANCE, and EXPLOITS, CUSTOMER SERVICE<P>All from the perspective of a Rallos Zek player.<P><BR>1.  BUGS / TWEAKS<P>AE Spells hit group members and / or pets.  This makes many AE spells effectively unuseable, despite the fact that many zones and encounters are tuned for the useage of such spells.<P>Uber Guards.  The buffed newbie guards kill the roleplaying enjoyment of city raids that used to occur.  (suggest restoring the guards to normal and removing experience gains for killing them)<P>Fear/Charm:  Enchanters would like a way for these spells to be restored, even at a much limited capacity  (ie. charmed players should not lose exp, and perhaps should react like an enchanter pet, only attacking who / what attacks the enchanter)<P><BR>BALANCE ISSUES<P>Item loot favors casters.  Item loot favors the opportunistic.  I love item loot, but only if it can be implemented fairly with equal risk to both parties...  Risk vs Reward.  Exploiters and opportunistic PKs risk nothing.<P>Newbie killing.  Its crazy and the number 1 reason why players who experiment on PVP quit within minutes.  On Rallos Zek PVP should not begin until level 5.  I have had a newbie killer slay a new character of mine before I had taken my FIRST NEWBIE STEP.  I entered the game for the first time on that character and saw Soandso has killed you, LOADING PLEASE WAIT...<P>Spells do lesser damage in pvp, 66% of the damage that they would do in pve.  This flat % for all levels does not solve the problem.  For example, a level 4 wizard is worthless at nuking in pvp, but a level 44 wizard can kill a level 40 enchanter in 2 spells.  The damage reduction should be on a SLIDING SCALE per LEVEL.<P>Spell Resistances.  Magic resistance items are a must have in pvp to prevent serious spells like blind, root, and mez.  As an enchanter, I am often faced with an even con opponent that none of my spells land on, even after I use my MR debuff.<P>Other spell resistances, like ice and fire, have a far less noticible effect on reducing the damage of those spells.<P>A deep look at how spells are resisted should be required.<P><BR>EXPLOITS<P>Deleveling.  This is an exploit achieved by melee characters.  A level 20+ melee character will get exp killed repeatedly until they are of a level to attack newbies with NO RISK to themselves.<P>Just 2 nights ago my level 8 Paladin was attacked by a Yellow con rogue who had a last name.  You can imagine how that battle went when I was being backstabbed for insane amounts of damage.<P>Customer service refuses to punish delevelers, even if they can observe someone purposefully taking advantage of this quirk in engine mechanics.<P>Exploit:  No line of sight required for pvp spells.  This causes many deaths in cities where a player has no hope of knowing where their opponent is casting from.<P>Level limit bypasses:  If you are invisible and someone out of range casts upon you, your invis will drop.<P>CUSTOMER SERVICE<P>The Rallos Zek rules posted on this website are outdated.  Many rules are enforced that appear nowhere in official documentation.  This also allows for an incredible amount of inconsistancy on rule enforcement.<P>There never are, nor can there ever be, enough guides and GMS on Rallos.  I've been exploited, trained, more times than I can count.  Never did a CS official arrive in time to help me with these issues.  Want to catch exploiters?  Put a newbie character in some armor and watch players use whatever means they can to kill that player.<P>Server moves?  In the past it was alluded that there might be server moves.  Abashi stated that there were enough players of each pvp type that there should be 2 coin only servers and 1 loot server.  However, none of the players on any of those servers were allowed to move.  Time invested in one's character is absolutely crucial, and people would not give this up even to protest not being allowed to move.<P>I'm sure I'll have more to add later...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I hope these points are concise enough.  The issues that I feel, from a Rallos Zek viewpoint, that should be dealt with follow.  I am trying to bring the problem up with possible solutions, but not knowing the full mechanics of the game, please treat my solutions as one possible suggestion.  Your creative people who have more inside knowledge know what is actually possible.<P>** General PvP problems on Rallos:<P>1.  Relentless player killing at newbie levels needs deterents or to be blocked.  Maybe a workable low-level limit for PvP to activate?<P>2.  Faction hits brought back in for PvP but make them locational so you only take faction hits for killing a race near its own city or zones with same-race guards.  There must be a penalty for murder, if no one is there (who cares) to witness it, you can however escape unnoticed.  In this scenario, when near your own city, and another race attacks you can freely defend yourself.  If your own race attacks escape or kill and take the faction hit.  In real life, even in self defense cases, you are looked upon dubiously by the authorities, in the EQ world that could mean death rather than a long trial.  If this solution doesn't work, there must be SOME faction system that will.<P>2b.  An alternative to point 2, would be to have guards agro zone wide for those that they would assist normally.  Prevents most from trying to PvP within a zone with guards.  Moves it out to the higher level areas and away from cities.  A duel could cloak this zone-wide agro so two consenting duelers wouldn't face the guards.<P>3.  PvP Looting.  Yes, Rallos has deteriated into two main groups of people.  Those who will work to get gear, and those that will gank someone to get it with little effort.  There is no risk vs. the reward in most PK cases.  Coin only loot?  Or some other solution as there are many cases where you can opporunistically kill someone with a single or dual cast and the steal what you may from their equiped items.<P>4.  Some classes have no PvP ability (enchanter or cleric vs. someone with high MR have no offensive ability minus the enchanter mana drain).  Some classes have uber PvP ability where 1 cast can kill.  Given that PvP situations are not something you always go into expectedly, classes should have at least reasonable defenses or slowed down so that escape is reasonable.  For example, a wizard can cast ice comet from max range where it hits as a suprise to the target (no "Fred begins casting..." message).  Then within 4 seconds a draught of fire will hit and kill the player.  So they have overall &lt; 4 seconds of reaction time from the first warning to go from full health to dead.  That's too fast to be called a PvP battle.  Maybe a different way to look at this is that PvP is too fast at high levels.<P>5.  Teleport and zone camping.  Again the 1 cast kills happen mostly at TP areas or zone boundaries.  Make these non PvP areas.<P>6.  Delevelling, this mostly effects the lower levels and setting a low level PvP embargo might make this moot anyway.  Otherwise it does have impact on the lower level PvP to offset the balance.<P>7.  Guild tags, make them stay up.  At higher levels the unguilded are more suspect.  And guilds at higher levels are known as to which are PvP, PK, Role play, etc.  So an indication of who the person is can be a big helper in preventing unwanted deaths.  If someone wants to be a murdering scum, them let their intent be known.  <P>8.  Rain spells.  Can't use them in most PvE cases either due to pets agro-ing, or players being hit.  <P>9.  Charming.  There should be a way to fix charm spells to bring them back into PvP.  Charming a pet, a player, etc.  Prior problems involved someone charming a player and sending them to their exp death.  Possible fix to bring it back:  Can a charmed player never attack mobs but only other players?<P>10.  Fear.  Fearing players and pets is a reasonable PvP tool.  Prior problems were using fear to exp kill players.  Someone creative can fix the possibilities and allow fear back in either on players, pets or both.<P>11.  Should the alternate Planes be PvP Safe?  A general question to throw out there.  They are tough, hard to monitor unexpected visitors, and places where you tend to be low health a lot and targets for the unscrupilous.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Easy to code ideas:<P>* AOE spells should never effect your pet, groupmates, or groupmate's pets.  Duh.<P>* A long time ago Abashi justified his nerfing of egg-shaped pumice by saying that they would still drop from certain mobs.  This is not true - egg-shaped pumice is completely unabtainable other than players who hoarded them pre-nerf.  Please make egg-shaped drop off mobs as promised.<P>* On the (riskless, twinkfilled) TZ and VZ servers enforce LnS by having a one-hour time limit in which a player can not enter a zone he/she was pk'd in.  Player corpses should appear at their feet at their bind spot.  If someone's bind is inside a zone they were pk'd in it should revert to their original bind point.  Yeah some people may use this to get free teleports, big deal.<P>* An easy way to increase the number of players on PvP servers is to make it so that level 4 and lower players can not be PvP attacked.  Level 1s and 2s are totally defenseless.  People might be more apt to try out PvP servers if they weren't slaughtered for their 5 silver on sight.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Rallos right now is plagued by a bunch of grief pk'ers that stoop to incredibly low levels just to get an item, without any item loss people who truly enjoyed pvping would stay, people who just want to pvp for the amazing items will leave which is good.<P>Rallos has the worst equipped tanks in the game, and 99% of the kills in the server are poor sport kills (5 on 1 ganks, killing right after someone zones out of a dungeon, picking people at low health off etch...).  Without the incentive of the loot, people will stop doing those stupid things and actually pvp will become enjoyable to teh majority of the server, not just the people who need to steal items from players.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree Snotz. Except on the balance part. PvP is not balanced when it comes to fighting. Maybe if you have a higher lvl that you can twink a lower lvl to balance out, then yes. <P>Anyway, loot is the problem. I hate to say this, but PvP should cause EXPERIENCE loss. I know exploits would be the first concern, but I honestly think with a feew weeks or maybe months that a system could be implemented to actually balance PvP through experience loss. I know most people will disagree. Try to keep an open mind about it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I do have a few pressing issues I would like addressed if possible. First I don't believe that the pvp servers will ever be truly fair or even really playable. When this game came out I wanted that extra element so I decided to set up shop on Rallos Zek. But with the amount of time and energy required obtain good gear and such to just lose it while in a major fight to an op-pk just makes the whole pursuit futile. Balancing will never happen because there will always be those who just want to exploit others and those who want to pvp in a roleplay setting. The two will always cosexist in a have and have-not relationship on pvp servers. That is the nature of the beast though and so this is not what I want changed.<P>What I would like... neigh, beg for... is some sort of opportunity for server splits on these servers. I know this has been addressed in the past as unbalancing but please hear me out. All of my friends from a few years of playing are on Rallos. All of my time and energy was spent there before I knew how bad it was. There's really no looking back now. I think that's the same for many of us. I know it would make me incredibly happy to have the opportunity to split either to a new server or to the coin-only loot teams server. If I had known there would be a pvp opportunity that didn't involve risking days of work for one item (coin only loot) I certainly would have taken it. Rallos was not given that opportunity. I don't see how moving those of us who wanted to another pvp server or a fresh server would be unbalancing. Please consider it.<P>Also as far as the recent changes go from todays patch (which is what I originally came to these boards to complain about) I think we need to reexamine the usefulness of some of the pvp changes made. This is especielly pertaining to the changes in harm touch. While I see how this can be abused I think the flip side of the coin should be looked at. I am one of the Rallos breed that doesn't go around murdering people all hours of the day for no better reason than to take their things and piss them off. So when I hear that harm touch was made unrechargable after death and lowered in effectiveness I just had to shake my head. I just started a sk that is level 20. He gets murdered. Over and over. I can't wear armor or jewelry. I can't turn my back ever. That's the way it is, but now you just took away my only defense. The only thing making that annoyance of a random newbie pk think twice. The only thing standing betweem continuing hunting and enjorying myself and losing a piece of armor with a 20 minute walk back to my corpse. This change has left me defenseless as a lower level shadow knight and left me throwing up my hands at my, now total, lack of any kind of ability to play unmolested for more than ten minutes at a time. This is not exaggeration. <P>So please, please consider making changes that would help those of us who want to pvp in a roleplaying setting able to play with those who just want to kill people over and over. I think that these would be welcome changes to all but the most obnoxious on our server. My thanks to you.<P><BR>Pathogen of Rallos Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Thank you for your effort on this.  Please keep in mind that we have gone through this process very extensively before, and as far as Rallos was concerned - nothing came of it.  If you have read any of my posts - you would know that I am quite bitter because of this previous lack of follow through. <P>As a Rallos player, the single most important thing that I feel requires attention is the lack of any in-game repercussions or balancing for PKing.  This was something we were told to expect in the form of factions, but that never happened and nothing was done to make up for the lack of factions.  I don't think there is much value in attempting to balance all of the classes for PvP - as PvP will never be fair. <P>As I am sure the designers know, allowing PvP to have such a high level of reward with virtually NO repercussions, is a fundementally flawed approach.  I assume this is why it was never the intention to do so, but for whatever reason - this is precisely what was done.  <P>Ask Brad what the original intentions were in regards to consequences for PK type behaviour, and see if perhaps the development team is able to re-evaluate the addition of those elements into the game.  I recall what he said, and it was clear to me at the time that he understood what was required.<P>Ask Brad, ask Raph. Both of them should be well aware of what PvP needs in terms of game design. It is not so much the lack of ideas on how to fix these problems that has hindered change as much as the lack of follow through on those ideas.<P>and BHehe - I have to disagree.  PvP players also pay the monthly fee, and seeing as PvP servers are offered - it would seem reasonable to me that Verant make an effort to fix the flaws on those servers.  How much sense would it make for Verant to not fix a hardware issue that only impacted one of their servers? I see this in very much the same light.<P>I will also refrain from making any additional posts - as it has been pointed out that my input usually hurts more than it helps. As I said - all this has been covered before, I have a hard time believing that anything of value will come from this attempt, no matter how sincere Absor's intent may be. <P>thanks,<BR>-tera<BR>the angry bitter gnome.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>PvP fixes:<P>No cross team beneficial casting on Tallon / Vallon. ie - no healing, buffing, rez, port NADA if they are not on your team. They are your enemies, you should not be able to help them fight/travel.<P>Safety blanket. You need 45 seconds after zoning where NO player can affect you in ANY way. This is to prevent getting nuked by a ganker after zoning away from danger.<P>Fair play. You MUST do 51% of the damage to a player to claim looting rights, not just the killing blow. Just like how it is with players and NPCs now. No more ganking someone who is almost dead from fighting an NPC.<P>I was very glad to see your change to shadowknight harm touch, both in damage and the no-xp-loss death refresh exploit.

</FONT><HR>Ghoul-Arch-Magus  you posted some things you would like to see to make PvP good... <P>1) No level loss on death. You can lose down to and empty bar on current level, but NEVER below.<P>You don't lose XP on PvP death, you don't lose xp on falling, drowning, dots, pets, lava, bleeding, or any other enviornment type death on a PvP server (least on VZ and TZ not sure on RZ)<P>2) No EXP loss EVER from a PvP death.<P>See above<P>3) Wizard roots with about 25% or less resist rate, but break on one DD cast if rooting another player.<P>At higher levels it is almost impossible to land a root on someone in PvP.. one time I stood there and casted root on a friend that was the same level as me.. I got the 25th one to land.<P>4) Spells hit for FULL damage.<P>The reason spells only hit for 63% is the fact that how would you like to take a full damage Ice Comet when you're a lvl 41-50 caster.. can you say very good chance of death.<P>5) You have a "PvP" bind as well as your normal bind. When you die to PvP, you go to your "PvP" bind spot which is ONLY in towns regardless of class, and your corpse is right beside you with ALL your money, items, and equipment on it. Only thing is you respawn there at 50% health, 50% mana, and 50% stamina.<P>I personally don't like this point, but that is just me... oh and so you know.. if you die to PvP you start with 0 mana once you finish loading at your bind point.<P>6) To qualify as a "PvP" death, at least 50% of your health must have been taken due to aggregate player damage. (Meaning if a NPC takes 90% of your health, your buddy can't kill you as an exploit)<P>This would cause way too much problems with Grief players.. oh look that guy is running from a mob and he is almost dead.. bume nuke woo caused him xp loss.  We have enough trouble with mobs involved in PvP to make it even easier for grief players to cause xp loss.<P>7) Players should face some kind of consequences from the NPCs in the world due to PKing. My idea is that if a person attacks you first, then you can kill them with no penalty. If you kill someone unprovoked, then you take a faction hit if they are on the same alignment as you. If you kill the same person 3 times in a certain time limit UNPROVOKED, then you are flagged as a murderer for a certain time limit, and are KOS to NPCs aligned with the victim.<P>On VZ and TZ you kill a player you get a faction hit.. as a high elf.. I killed 2 humans, can't buy/sell in HH, HK, FP, Qeynos.. a few more humans dead at my hands.. well I'm KoS to almost all human NPC's.<P>8) AE spells cast on NPCs would NEVER hit other players, but AE spells cast on a player would hit that player and any other player who has attacked you, and is in range.<P>I like the cast on NPC would never hit another player... would make using AE in PvE play an option.. but there is nothing like coming up on a group of darkies (DE, Trolls, Ogres, Iksar) and dropping an AE rain on them.. the way you say it this wouldn't be possible 'cause they haven't attacked me.<P><BR>9) If you are killed by a PKer, you could hire a NPC "assassin" to get revenge for you. The "assassin" would be of equal level to the person who killed you for fairness.<P>God you want to send a lvl 60 mob after a lvl 60 player?  I'd like to see any one person that would have a remote chance at lvl 60 against a lvl 60 mob 1 on 1.  Bad idea in my opinion.<P><BR>Zalendar Fairthane<BR>Defiant<BR>Vallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I play on vallon zek, i've several characters my main being a druid.<P>The main problem that needs addressing is immortal healers and OOR healing.<P>To seperate the 2.<BR>Out Of Range healing is just that take to ppl lvl 20, person A is fighting person B, person A has a lvl 60 cleric friend Cleric heals person A during the fighting and there is nothing, absolutely nothing the lvl 20 player can do.<P>I don't know if its possible to tell if a player is in pvp combat rather than pve combat, if it is it would be an idea to prevent OOR healing for this duration (and likewise buffs etc).<P>Immortal healing<BR>Player A is a dark elf, and player B is a wood elf. Player B has a dark elf cleric friend, during the fighting dark elf heals the wood elf, and regardless of their level (because the cleric and Player A are both of the same team), there is nothing player A can do to harm the cleric.<P>Reducing the lvl cap to 4 levels would be a tragedy on the PvP servers and would only add to the out of range healing issue - especially at high lvls where you have guildmates who are say lvl 52-60, in a large battle if the ranges are reduced all kinds of OOR healing will be a problem.<P>To stop the problem of immortal healing - i suggest that anyone healing a member of a different race has a 'traitor' tag set so that for a period of 10 minutes after casting a healing, buff damage shield etc... on a different race member, thet can be attacked by any race, even there own. There should be NO faction loss for killing ppl who have a 'traitor' tag set.<P>To be honest Teams servers have been GvE servers for the large majority - mainly because at the servers birth the ratio of darkies was much higher than any other team. Perhaps making one of the Teams servers a GvE server (based on religion), would be something worth consideration. When this happens make it hard coded that ppl on the good team can't cast any beneficial spells on Evil members and visa versa.<BR>A neutral alignment could possibly be implemented where agnostics and neutrally aligned worshippers are placed. They could choose a team to join and until then can attack any other neutral/good or evil player and be attacked back by them (within the 8 lvl limit).<P>Another reason why lighties might band together is that the shortie and elf team lack classes that are incrediably beneficial to a PvE situation (Shamans and monks), elves also lack anyway of summoning their corpses when a raid goes wrong...<P>Specific class PvP issues i'm sure you'll here all kinds of arguments, but to be honest i really don't think these are the main problem on VZ and TZ. <P>Be very careful before you consider nerfing any spells, at high level this could destroy classes easily as ppl have such high resists (170+) MR for example, with kunark/velious weapons and disciplines, tanks are already a very formidable opponent if used in the right hands. Some classes nukes are already easily resisted because of this, to weaken spell lines more would make them pointless in pvp.<P>Peoni Greenleaf<BR>Naturewalker of Tunare<BR>Vallon Zek<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Thanks for some attention to the pvp server Absor. I must say however you can dig up 5 threads that were split and left to rot ages ago that were mostly ignored that sum up a great deal of problems in pvp.<P>1)Crossteam healing/buffing on pvp teams servers. This needs to end... Yes Im sure some crossteaming uber tz/vz guilds will be upset.. oh well.. you signed up for racewar when you started on tz/vz.<P>2)AoE Spells on red servers.. there are about a gajillion threads about this recently.. so I wont go into detail =P<P>3)Make EGG SHAPED PUMICE available again on RED servers please.. it is very necessary as a melee player to keep the playing field level.<P>4)A way to soulbind those "uber" precious things "rbb/cof" available to epic/event type item rewards so that they can not be looted by a pvp death. I think pvp needs some kind of penalty for death.. Im not a big coin only fan.. but in the absence of some way to soulbind(some VERY VERY expensive or consuming quest) endgame items that are not no drop then thought should be given at least towards coin only.(losing a fbss might ruin my day.. losing a cof would make me cry rofl)<P>5)Pets in pvp.. come on now.. have you seen a warrior try and fight a pet at most level ranges? Why WHY is a pet a caster can summon*a PET* have more hps.. more ac and more atk and more haste then your average ACTUAL TANK? Even pvp nerfed as pets are on RED servers they are still too strong pvp wise.<P>6)Not really a pvp concern.. but STOP nerfing warriors by association. You give all other plate classes our defence cap.. and state we will still have more ac.. without mentioning that warrior armor is *uber* rare compared to the hybrid armor lol.

</FONT><HR>You want to talk about PvP?<P>WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THE REAL VERANT?!?<P>Ok, all better.<P>Ach-hem.<P>Item 1)  Z-axis poofing.<BR>This is an Everquest issue in general, but it adversely effects PvP.  Simply, when a player is too much higher or lower than you (frequently as little as about 6 feet), they can simply vanish.  The server stops sending you information about them, even if you have them targeted, even after the recent improvements to update rate.<P>The simple fix, IMO, is if you have someone targeted, the server should send you information about them no matter where they are, what altitude, etc.<P>(I frequently wonder if it's just a bug with the Z-axis, where it miscalculates, thinking that 5' above = 500' above, so it decides the target is out of range and stops sending information, even though they should be in plain sight.)<P>Item 2) "Immortal buffing".<BR>I call it immortal buffing, because 'healing' is only part of it.  This is on Team-PvP where a dark elf heals a human who is killing another dark elf.  The dark elf being killed cannot defend himself from the immortal buffer, because they are on the same team.  The most reasonable "fix" for this that I've heard is to implement PvP flags -- normally you can crossbuff and heal all you want, but if you are damaged by another player, then for a certain period of time, only people from your team can heal and buff you.<P>There is also an "out of range" componet to this, but in my opinion as a player who has been on Vallon Zek full time since it opened, OOR buffing is not worth addressing.  Same-team buffing is the main problem and the main source of grief players.<P>Item 3) Guides showing up on ShowEQ.<BR>Not technically a PvP issue, but it's a griefer issue, and griefers like PvP servers.  Simply, a guide entering a zone invisibly to scout for exploiters will show up on ShowEQ.  The grief players know when to stop causing trains, etc, because of this.  Fix this, catch the griefers, everyone is happy.<P>Item 4) PvP death penalty.<BR>Simply put, there isn't one.  Making harm touch not recycle when killed is a good start, but in addition, mana regeneration should be crippled and melee attack speed should be lowered via an un-dispellable "rez effect".  Exact details can be debated, but there needs to be SOME death penalty.  On VZ/TZ, where items cannot be looted, griefplay is simply out of hand, partially because there is no penalty for dying a PvP death.<P>Item 5) Unresistable DOT's.<BR>These need to be addressed for PvP.  Winged Death, Drifting Death, Splurt, etc, are all 99% unresistable DOT's that do ridiculous amounts of damage for their mana cost/cast time.  This wasn't a big deal until Egg Shaped Pumice was removed.  Warriors, rogues and monks cannot dispell themselves with the new Crystallized Pumice because they have no channeling skill.  A 1 damage hit from a druid will interrupt them 100% of the time.<P>Item 6) Twinkage.<BR>This is really a consequence of removing item loot from VZ/TZ.  Level 20's in fungal regrowth tunics, wielding weapons that are near epic quality with full sets of diamond/blue diamond resist gear.  That's just not fun for anyone, and when you do finally kill them, they're back in action 30 seconds later because there's no PvP death penalty.  Low levels are completely in favor of melee twinks these days.

Currently, a player cannot cast on an NPC through a wall.  You CAN cast on another player through a wall, though.

</FONT><HR>I am going to make this repost again, in light of the Pandemonium problem (4 team guild that is actively PVPing against all races).<P>Make all the PVP Players happy and not use additional servers? Heres how: <BR> <BR>This solves the issues of long time Rallos players who want to move / change to coin only loot, keeps a server item loot for those that want it, gives 3 distinct PVP options for players to choose from, solves the X-Teaming issues on Tallon Zek and does not need additional server resources. <BR> <BR>1. Open up moves between all three servers. <BR> <BR>2. Modify the Red Discord (i.e.: Turning in the Book) flag on the Tallon Zek Teams server thusly: <BR>Players who turn in the book are: <BR> <BR>A) Able to attack / be attacked by anyone in their level range, despite Racial Team. <BR> <BR>B) Be able to Heal / Buff anyone on any team. <BR> <BR>C) Players who do _NOT_ turn in their book can only heal / buff those on their own racial team. <BR> <BR>D) Change or remove faction hits. Either remove faction hits entirely from Tallon Zek PVP or make those players who turned in their book (Red) not cause faction hits if killed, but do take racial faction hits for killing non red characters. <BR> <BR>E) Make it a petitionable offense to aggressively heal / buff a Red character of your own racial team who is attacking members of your team while you are not set Red yourself.  The penalty for being observed doing this would be to have the GMs set you Red.<BR> <BR>3. Any characters moving from Rallos Zek to the Tallon Zek server are automatically set Red as they were on Rallos with the rulesets above applied to them. <BR> <BR>4. Any characters moving from Rallos Zek to the Vallon Zek server are automatically set to the default PVP settings of their racial team with the standard server rulesets applied to them. <BR> <BR>5. Characters moving from either of the Teams Servers to Rallos would be automatically set Red and have the Rallos Zek standard rulesets apply to them. <BR> <BR>6. Redesignate the servers as follows: <BR>------] Rallos Zek (Open PVP)<BR>------] Tallon Zek (Open War / Roleplay PVP)<BR>------] Vallon Zek (PVP Teams) <BR> <BR>How is this unworkable? Wont this satisfy all your concerns with retaining PVP options for all players and solve the invulnerable healer syndrome caused by crossteaming ? <BR> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>  #1 - NO CROSSTEAM BENEFICIAL SPELLS.   They are the enemy, and it takes away from the servers when you allow it.   VZ and TZ are RACEWAR servers, you should not be benefited by having immortal healers and the like when you choose to crossteam.  It should be a HINDRANCE to crossteam, not a benefit.<P>  #2 - Dont allow members of different teams to be in the same guild.<P>  #3 - I think it would be the benefit to VZ and TZ for them to be made into a GvE environment, with the elf, human and short teams combined.  Separate, they arent a match for the evil team.  Combined, they outnumber the evil team, but at least its a more fair fight than the first choice.  The servers evolved into Good vs Evil basically because of the unevenness of the numbers of players that wanted to be dark, vs the numbers that wanted to join any of the individual lightie teams.   Doing it GvE would let these guilds continue to exist, but not allow the 4team guilds that are basically the bane of our servers to exist.<P>  <P>  Please, do something to stop the 4team guilds that take SO MUCh away from the VZ and TZ atmosphere.

</FONT><HR>Uh... seriously now. We've done without coin only for two years... do NOT make the mistake of resorting to such a drastic change this late in the game. This is one of the features that makes RZ closer to any form of real PVP... even though it's still a gigantic stretch. No one, and I mean no one, walks around with an amount of money worth crap on RZ. Unless you want to spawn a new form of "let's pk people getting tinker bag" pking... then coin-only should be the LAST thing on your minds.<P>Also, when you are in full nodrop, or fully naked... the excitement of the fight is so drastically reduced that a kill/death becomes nothing more than "well, I'll be back in 30 seconds anyway"...<P>We know the risks of wearing gear on RZ. If I wear my resist gear and get pked, well I lose a peice of resist gear. If I wear something else and get pked... well I lose that too. I understand and accept this fact as well as anyone else playing on Rallos Zek.<P>Rallos Zek is Rallos Zek because it ISN'T Vallon / Tallon Zek. We have a PVP LOOT Server, and PVP Team COIN server. If you want to incorperate coin-only, then you should make a new server... PVP No-Team COIN server... and allow people to /move (or whatever the command was for the blue server people to move to a "new" fresh server).<P>I think if such a change was even being remotely considered, this would be the ONLY fair option to the 2 year+ veterans of Rallos Zek.<P>In fact, I think Rallos Zek should be made the hardcore pvp server... and you should open another "toned down" pvp server for the people that choose not to participate. For example: lootable bags is a great idea (one item, same restrictions as any other items). Or, perhaps create a new "type" of effect or something... for items recently "PK'ed". Example "Special Rent" or something. Once taken from another players corpse (from a pvp death), this item CANNOT be placed in a bag OR the bank for a certain period of time. That way people have a chance to get it back. I dunno, something along those lines...<P>The "***** gankers" problem needs to be fixed. As adressed before... if NPCs do 51%, a ***** ganker can't loot you if they kill you.<P>I don't have any problems with delevelers. If they spend the time to level to 50 and get uber gear, then delevel wasting all that time... why is that a problem? Yeah they become great pking characters... so? They spent the time to do it, why is that wrong? As long as they don't harrass people (ie: bind point kill, repetetive killing, talk ****, exploit) like anyone else... where is the problem?<P>The AE spells definitely need to be fixed. Your pet and your groups pets should not be hittable with AE spells cast within that group. At the worst case, they shouldn't hit your group members. That shoulda been obvious.<P>Well anyway... be reasonable and DO NOT change to coin-only loot on RZ. It's been this way for 2 years and there is no reason to screw the people that have played here under these rules for that long... or anyone else that has chosen to remain here after learning of the rules. Make a new server. Change Rallos Zek to: Rallos Zek (PVP Hardcore). We don't need you to make the game even MORE like EverQuake. Load... kill... load... kill... load... kill. At least it requires some thinging... what items to wear, what you can afford to take into battle and possibly lose... blah blah blah. I'm sure you have hear it 100 times.<P>Well whatever, I'm probably not being very coherent right now. Been up all night. Suck.<P>Don't make a drastic change to RZ this late in the game... though (PVP) pales in comparison to the amount of (BLUE) servers... we still pay, we still play, and we know what we are getting into when start chars on this server. Anyone who doesn't know needs to do a little more research.<P>Later...<P>xein the green<BR>rallos zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Is it because 99% of the server enjoys being able to wear their good item without fear of ganking?

</FONT><HR>Hi Absor,<P>Glad to see some thought being applied to EQ PvP. I've played on Rallos since June of 1999 and continue to play on that server exclusively.<P>I hope you even get to read any of the posts in this thread that contain valuable content and you skim past the "EQ is not meant to be PvP" and other whines. I think there is tremendous potential for an enjoyable PvP environment in the game.<P>Having said that, I don't think you'll get anywhere without setting some sort of framework for discussion. Somethine like you did for the class balancing. Just an open thread about PvP is likely to send you right off the wagon, if you're not there already.<P>One last note. IMHO, although there are 3 PvP servers, I feel that the two environments -- teams and individual -- are vastly different and have vastly different issues. As such, what might be suitable on one might be devasting on the other.<P>Hope this helps.<P>Dagny Stout<BR>47 Priestess of Tunare<BR>Drunkards of Rallos</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Its very reassuring to see Verant actually acknowledge the pvp servers.<P>In the last month you've made alot of fixes, which improves gameplay ALOT.<P>-bard song no longer cancels other movement spells<BR>-no more HT rushing (please Lay on Hands to this nerf also, granted it isnt instant respawn dmg it can still be abused)<BR>-HT pvp dmg nerf<P>We've seen progress in the last month, now to some other stuff we need fixed<P>Bind rushing by casters was fixed some time back by pvp death - no mana respawn.  Well something needs to be done to melees also.  Ever try to take control of highpass or other zones that melees are bound in?  You kill them then BAM they run up and loot gear and attack you again.  I suggest res effects for ALL players in PVP death.  This will at least allow the pvp victor a chance to rest up from waves of bind rushers.  Since there is no item loot on the team servers it might add some penatly for death besides a slight 30 second inconvience.  It would cut down on the wasted time EQCSR waste investigating bind rushers etc.<P>Someone else mentioned this eariler.  Qeynos and Surefall guards are associating halfelves on their faction.  If I'm a human and kill 100 halfelves I'm now KOS to 2 human cities.  Doesnt make much sense to me, please fix halfelf pvp faction hits.<P>Change the con system for pvp.  At high levels you cant hit some blues, at low levels you find green cons and figure an easy kill.  Please make all players in your attack range WHITE/EVEN con.  Out of range (too low) green and out of range (too high) red.  It would add some realism and mystery..or something heh.<P>Lower the casting time for cystallized pumice to 2/3 seconds and/or give pure melees some channeling ability. <P>Apply the pvp dmg nerf to damage shields.  They do insane amounts of damage at mid level and/or when a high level player buffs newbies.  Dont know if it has been fixed, but I believe you still get hit by dmg shields when using ranged weapons also.<P>Fix illusions.  Perma-mez still around if you mez someone in non-race illusions (skeleton, elementals, wolf etc).  Also you cannot use ranged weapons on someone that illusioned as your team. (IE I am a barbarian, I cannot hit a gnome with my bow when he is illusioned as a human)<P>Immortal and Out of Range Healing(THe BIG issue for TZ/VZ)<P>When Verant Interactive designed the pvp system they made 4 teams.  Many players chose to team up with players from differing teams.  There is nothing inherently wrong with this, except that pure team pvp players have no recourse.  In the case of immortal healing, a player of the same race heals an aggressors target, the aggressor cannot do anything but call in help from other teams, which isnt exactly pure teaming.  In out-of-range healing, obviously the person healing or buffing against the aggressor is out of the 8 level range.<P>Please make some sort of pvp tag for when someone is attacked.  Once this flag is on a player it stays there until they zone.  With a pvp flag on someone, no one from opposing teams or +/- 8 levels (or possibly anyone that would get exp in a group with them.  IE+/- 12 levels for higher levels) can heal or buff them.  Using this system the majority of grief pvp and lame immortal/OOR would be solved...while still letting guilds crossteam for pve purposes.<P><BR>Thanks in advance.<BR>Diggles Darkreign<BR>Da Bashin' Iggles - Vallon Zek<BR>GM wannabe<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I play a 45th level paladin on vallon zek.  Seriously, the only thing that can be done to fix the servers is letting people /movelog over to a blue server.  Any change other than that will drive away most of the server away.  Atleast if you /movelog them to a blue server the hardcore pvp people will stay, and if a good amount of the people leave you can combine tallon and vallon.  I have been playing on vallon zek since 2 months after it formed, which is when I bought your game.  The way vallon (and tallon I suspect) is light vs dark, not 4 teams, the only real users of the 4 teams rule are roleplaying guilds/newbies.  If you for example changed the way people can be buffed or healed people of the other races you would RUIN the server.  People would either move to a different server or just quit the game.  The best course of action for everyone is to give tallon and vallon players the chance to /movelog to a blue server new or old, and combine the remaining people on both servers into one.    Both tallon and vallon at peak times have as much players as normal servers do at the lowest playing hours.  That seems to me like a waste of power,bandwith, computers, and money if you ask me.<BR>My views are probably pretty out there, but think about them, they just might make sense to you.  <BR>Let the flaming of my views begin   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Another thing, I am heart broken about these shadow knight changes and wish to destroy rallos, so here it goes. Enchanters can Theft of Thought pure melees in pvp, allowing them to have more mana than pve players are allowed. Necromancers can cast a spell that heals more hps than they have while taking them away from you at the same time, not to mention the damage they do is enough to kill a small army of players. Wizards can hide behind a wall and kill you with magic before you can find them or get out of range. Pet classes do more damage with pets in pvp than most pure melees. Bards can snare,fear,dot, and outright kill players in pvp. Nope they didnt fix that with bards. Trolls start out with a base of 5 fire resist, maybe this should be fixed for pvp since it doesnt allow players to play the race they would wish. Paladins can still die to refresh their instant casting complete heal but a shadow knight cant die to refresh his instant casting ice comet...thats real fair and balanced. When shadow knights are suppose to be the death knights and paladins are suppose to be the life knights, this nerf seems to have unbalanced a good balance between them. I guess our sucky dots in comparison to their superior heal,1000+ hps buffs, and stuns make up for that though huh? Bleh Bleh Bleh I hate you </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor. I have a 51 wizard on Rallos. What I do not like about pvp is that I hate getting my items taken. Any good item you get in EQ has to be camped, and when you put in time and some jerk just kills you and takes it it sucks. Most of the time I never even know what hit me. I see my buffs disappear and im dead by the time I turn around. Just allow moves to the blue servers and keep the pvp how it is.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059914-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059914.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059914-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059914-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059914-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059914-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059914-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=059914&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=059914&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
