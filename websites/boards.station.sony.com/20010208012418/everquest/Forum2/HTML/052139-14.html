</FONT><HR>Can you add the ability to unscribe spells from the spell book?<P>I play a level 60 enchanter and 98% of my pets I will never scribe again. I will never scribe Gift of magic or insight again since Gift of Brilliance is an upgrade that renders them useless.<P>Can you make Root or upgraded versions of Root more useful?<P>Since the release of SoV our crowd control abilities have went to the birds. 50% of mobs in PoG cant be mesmerized. Giants cant be mesmerized. Dragons cant be mezmerized. <P>Dictate while a good spell and useful I wish the duration lasted just alittle longer seeing that we cant mezmerize 75% of SoV population.<P>The hole has limitations making it so we cant mezmerize mobs 50+, makes for some exciting adventures and probably explains why people dont venture deep into the hole often.<P>It seems to me that verant caters to the level 30-50 enchanters giving them spells galore. When you hit 60 you role is almost 90% buffing. If that case will remain I would like to see our buffs have a longer duration...perhaps buffs could last longer per level you are. I mean if clarity at 29 lasts 27minutes then why couldnt it last 55.86minutes at 60?<P>I like your mask faith illusion idea, I hope it could be level 60. Giving the newb chanters something to shoot for.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Quite honestly, I, like many other post 50 enchanters, have felt myself slipping increasingly into the auxilary buffing role that so many others have talked about.  On single uber-spawns I, like other tashers, enjoy the excitement of being the first person summoned (Lady Vox/Lord Nagefen/Generic Fear or Hate Spawn_00/Froglock/Other Horrible Monster_01 says, "You will not evade me Maldisdain") and the first person dead.<P>Most enchanters don't mind it so much, actually.  We do our job, get killed and get ressurected.<P>The problem here is that, with the exception of Lady Vox, there is no use for more than one enchanter in these circumstances.<P>Maybe that's not so bad, either.<P>Other high-end encounters have increasingly similar results... mobs become untouchable with mezes or charm or roots... or maybe they can be rooted if they are tashania(n)ed... in which case... <P>Generic High Level Velious Spawn_00 glances about nervously.<BR>Generic High Level Velious Spawn_00 says, "You will not evade me Maldisdain."<BR>Generic High Level Velious Spawn_00 hits YOU for 405 damage.<BR>Generic High Level Velious Spawn_00 bashes YOU for 200 damage.<BR>YOU are stunned.<BR>Generic High Level Velious Spawn_00's feet adhere to the ground.<BR>You tell your group, "backing off... atone please."<BR>Generic High Level Velious Spawn_00 says, "You will not evade me Maldisdain."<P>You get the idea.<P>The alternative is really mobs so easily controlled (by a good enchanter) that we are relegated to a very tedious buffing role.  Swapping 3-5 spells out every 2 minutes is very aggravating... and with the demand for Boon Of the Garou (which isn't a particularly productive spell, truth be told), one more spell slot is gone.<P>On the plus side, with the way that our Memory Blur series fails consistently on high level spawns, it's relegated to the unmemorized page.<P>Though if Reoccurring Amnesia actually REOCCURRED, we wouldn't have the instant tashaniaing death scenarios that occur above.  Just a thought.  Fix that, if you could.<P>Additionally, I'm of the school that if a monster can do something, there should be a player class that can do it as well.  Similarly, that if a player class can do something, an NPC class should be able to do it.  (A good example is the MOBs that now cast Gate... a great addition.)<P>SO... <BR>1. SUMMON.  Not Magician summons... I don't want to step on their toes and make the poor class even less desireable (sorry, guys, I still like you).  But an ENCHANTMENT type of summon... thus...<P>A Froglock Ilis Wizard begins to cast the Gate spell.<BR>The_Group_Cleric tells the group, "dammit. he gated, sorry.  zone."<BR>You begin to cast Summons of Will.<BR>Maldisdain says, "You will not evade me, A Froglock Ilis Wizard."<BR>&lt;Battle spam&gt;<BR>The_Group_Warrior_With_Epic_Weapons_CoF_and_Haste has slain A Froglock Ilis Wizard.<P>In short, here is the idea: a single target spell that, maybe, costs a lot of mana, has a long recast time, or just a huge aggro (Of these, I recommend a HUGE aggro and low mana cost & casting time.  It makes the game much more epic when classes put their lives on the line for the group.) and that summons a monster back in the same way that high level mobs can summon people to them.<P>It makes chanters MUCH more useful in high-level single mob situations (such as when a camp has already been broken) and it adds a real FEEL of excitement... like we characters are beginning to become *truly powerful* and not just low-budget would-be mobs.<P>2. Group Dispel Magic.<BR>I know someone else has already brought this up, but I thought I'd reiterate it because I think it continues in the vein of giving PCs some of the same abilities of high level mobs.  Will anyone ever use this spell?  I don't know.  Perhaps.  But, again, it will do a lot to foster feelings of contentment if it's added.<P>SUMMARY:<BR>1. Add a spell "Summons of Will" that calls back a fleeing mob to the enchanter's feet and makes the mob aggro HARD on the chanter.  Make it fairly low mana cost and quick cast/recast time.<BR>2. Add an area of effect dispel magic (that would only affect mobs).<P>If nothing else, these changes will make me feel more useful.<P> Maldisdain Atheist<BR>*** Illusionist ***<BR>    Cazic-Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have a level 60 Enchanter on 7th hammer. I have 133 days played so far. I have mostly made most of my exp and have my exp playing in groups. I've learned quite a bit over my play time and i'm sure i'll learn more. I'll do my best below to point out some things that need to be changed in terms of "balance", and I'll try to steer clear of the wish list type stuff except for a few things I need to say just so i'm added to the many who want the same thing. <P>I've read over alot of the post to the point that many are repeating themselves. I'm not a writer, and I have poor grammer, but i'm good at math, hehe. Please forgive me if I don't write fancy.<P>Ok, first I'd like to say thank you for taking the time to look over all the classes like your doing.<P>Armor Class (AC): AC is out of balance with all casters at higher levels compared with levels 1-50 Before level 51-60 came along AC was fairly balanced among mele and casters. Chanters had anywhere from 50-75 ac more than a wizard, necro or magi, but thats cause they tank more. Overall at level 50 Casters had a couple hundred AC less than mele. Now though, a level 60 mele on average might have 1100-1150 or more ac while the caster still have less than 700 (chanter's have close to 700 or more, other casters have less). At 50, it was about 900-950 for mele. The gap isn't the same at 60 as it is at 50. Something ain't right. When Kunark came out there wasn't any new armor with more ac for casters yet the mobs hit much harder. Why is that? What happens is this: Chanter gets resisted, chanter gets hit for full damage most of the hits, cleric chain cast heal to keep the chanter healed till he can manage to get mob mezed, cleric is 20 mana. My ac is only a few points higher now than it was at level 50 yet the mele classes have much higher AC. Something in the AC needs to be changed, either in the new armor or in how AC is raised as we level. Please look at AC, its possible that it was overlooked for caster clases when Kunark was made and the new levels added.<P>Mana Pool: The mana pool of casters is unbalanced compared with the ability of the mele class. I have only a couple hundred more mana now than when I had at level 50. Many of my spells cost a lot of mana. If the mele classes can have increased damage weapons which do more damage for the amount of hits they give then casters should have more mana to give more damage or in the chanters case control more. When having to use the high level mez's that require 275 mana and the other is 425 (i think its 425) I can only keep a mob mezed for a couple minutes before I'm OOM. It seems the higher level i've become and the more new and high mana spells i've gained i've become lower and lower on mana. I'm not sure how well i've said the mana pool argument but I hope you can see what i'm trying to say. Please look into the mana-pool of all clases, including clerics and any class that uses mana. It seems much lower than it should be compared with the cost of the spells. If the mana pool can't be increased then please look at the mana-cost of the spells.<P>WereWolf Form: I'm not sure if this is a balance issue but the WW form is or should be unique to Enchanters. The unique to a class argument has been used for many clases from SoW to the Spectre form for Necros. Anyhow, I think it was a mistake to give Bards the WW illusion in some flute that drops in Veliuos. Please remove this from the game. You guys have disrespected Enchanters on the illusion issue enough and to give WW illusion to a class is just another slap in the face of Enchanters. We put up with alot of stuff. The class is very hard to play we have to put up with alot of stuff when playing and take care of alot of peoples buffs. Please remove the Bard Flute with WW form and keep the WW form unique to the Enchanter class.<P>Giant Control: Again, not sure if this is a balance issue but it is an issue of class happiness. It is always a challenge to go to Kael for me. I have fun there but I also feel very useless. I can do one of two things to help with crowd control there. Root, or charm. I can think of a few things to help in Kael. 1. Make a new "Giant Mez" spell thats about 250 mana and can mez giants for about 45 seconds. 2. Make the "lull" line of spells less resistable so we can help the puller pull only one mob. If it is resisted then it shouldn't be agro and make a train.<P>Thats all i can think of that fall under "balance". AC and mana-pool is the main thing that is making us unbalanced. Please look into these.<P>Spells and possible bugs:<P>Level 54 Mez Glamour of Kintaz: This is a helpful mez for 56-57 mobs but it is resisted to much for the mana cost. It only last around 30 seconds for 275 mana it shouldn't be resisted as much as it is. Only with gaining levels have I had a few less resist.<P>Level 59 Rapture: 425 mana it to much for only a 24 or so second mez. I know, the spell is nearly unresistable. It still is to much mana for only 24 seconds when comparing with my mana pool at level 60 and compared with my level 50 mana pool. Please lower the mana cost or increase the length to 30 or 40 seconds.<P>Level 60 Dictate: This is the 48 second charm spell thats nearly unresistable unless the mob is taged uncharmable. 48 seconds isn't enough time to kill the first mob. Usually when this spell is used its because the mobs can't be mezed with any spells (unmezable tags). So, if the mobs can't be mezed, charm em, but what happens is the other mobs are only charmable with this spell and it only last 48 seconds. Well, the first mob usually don't die in 48 seconds (unless we have a small army). What happens is after 48 seconds I have to die, or manage to stay alive while the cleric dumps all his mana into me for heals while the other mob is being finished off. One of two things can be done to change this situation. 1. Make the charm last a bit longer. 90 seconds would prolly be just right. Possibly even 75 seconds. 2. Make the spell not agro after it drops. The spell is very powerful the way it is, but it seems to need some adjustment since it is depended on more and more in Velious zones.<P>Gift of Brilliance: Nice spell, I like it, but it cost alot of mana. At first the 1.5 hours seemed long but now it seems short. Please lower the mana cost of this spell (compared with my mana pool being so low, hehe). I can cast this spell about 6 times with full mana, maybe 7. If i'm the only chanter thats level 60 on a raid with 30 people, and half of them want GoB then that can be very time consuming. Then I have to speed the other 15 with a 275 mana spell not to mention C2 and any that want a wis/int buff. Again, this is all going back to how the mana pool of casters is to low, OR the spells cost to much to cast.<P>THE HOLE: GRRR, I hate this zone and so does 99.9% of all enchanters. The Hole is hardly used, ya know why? Cause the lower part of the zone isn't doable unless you have a druid of a wizard to warp you out. There is NO easy way to get to the exit zone. Once you drop down off that upper area down to the castle area you can't get back up unless you gate, or group evac. I do think you can fight your way to the locked door and I think a rogue can open to get out but thats another class you'd need. The reason the Hole isn't used deep is cause all the mobs that are 54+ are TOTALLY unmezable. Even with Rapture. If I remember right, they are also uncharmable. Please either lower the level of the mobs to 53 or under, or make the mobs in the Hole have the same Mez/Charm rules as Velious.<P>Equipment: I agree with all the other posters that the Armor from Velious with the effects needs to be looked at. I was LMAO when I got my Bracer with the Effect: Recalim Energy. I never even bought that spell, haha. I have it on the bracer now though. Enchanters aren't pet classes, even Verant guys say this yet they have the nerve to give us Reclaim Energy as a spell on some armor. That is just an insult to us. It should have been an AE stun or Group RM. Something useful, not Reclaim Energy ROFLMAO *points at the designer and says shame on you for making this*. The Robe is nice, but i'll never, never, never, ever, use the effect Rune4. I very rarely used rune4 when I got it and I sure won't stand still for 28 seconds to cast a spell with the robe and still use a peridot. Please change the robe's effect. Make it rune5 or make the robe not require a peridot. I think if it didn't use a peridot that wouldn't be as bad. <P>Casting times: Please change the casting time on armor. This is silly. 20-30 seconds to cast spells, come on guys your ruining the game. Make it so the armor has a "recast" time, NOT a casting time. If there is a "recast" time, and the casting time is left the same then it is useful but not abusable. Think about it. Everytime you guys change something like this that makes the game fun for us you make it unfun. Why in the hell do you give us an effect on some armor then put a 30 second cast time plus make it us a component? For example: Cleric BP with CH: Its a 30 second cast now. Why not make it where it is a 10 second cast (what clerics timing is used to) and have a 2 minute recast time? That would be a good solution.<P>Level 55 Chanter Pet: Please be fair and make the 55 pet be summoned with 2 swords so that it duel wields. You made all the other pets be able to duel wield automatically but left out enchanters. If I want to make a pet I still have to carry around a dagger or a 1H sword. Please change this, make us happy like you did the other clases that can make pets.<P>Visions of Grandeur: 15 second recast time: Why? Why does this spell have a 15 second recast time? Do you know how annoying it is to wait 15 seconds between cast when you have 10 or so mele waiting for you to buff em? This is so annoying I wish I didn't have the spell now. Please remove the recast time or lower it to only a second or two. have a little mercy for the BuffWhores of Norrath.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>NEW SPELL!: Absor's Gift of Pure Thought. 1 second cast and recast time. Effect: Clarity-3<P>If you read this far, thank you. Please look at AC and ManaPools of casters. Those seem to be a balance issue that will help the game be more fun. The rest is rehash.<P><BR>While i'm typing . . <P>Make a thing that you can stack ring jewelry on, one for bracers, one for earrings. Many player have 2-3 bags full of resist gear, one tiny ring takes up a whole slot. If you can't make jewelry stackable somehow then make some 12-14 slot backpacks available. <P>More Buff Slots on the screen. Its limited to 15 now. It needs to be more, maybe 23.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>PvP Issue (I know that you don't specifically want these but it is a VERY big issue)<P>in PvP enchanters are quite litereally helpless if someone is able to get ohhhh 100MR or so with their equipment, which is very common on the PvP server.  Granted that if they are vunerable to even one enchaner spell they are totally skrewed.  but that doesn't help when the majority of high level players are untouchable by enchanters.  My 51 'chanter can't kill any of her enemies because they just have too much MR.  At level 50 we should get a massive, quick casting, and high mana-costing (unresistable) tashan spell, which kills a LOT of MR... hell make it take a reg.<P>Speaking of regs I would also like to bring up the issue with the Rune line of spells.  Personally, I am poor.  I am a 200 skill jewelcrafter but there really isn't a large market for jewelery other than for diamond and above stuff... and I can do that, but you don't make very much money on it, and it is rare (most of the time it if for guildmates and lets face it - most guilds help each other out, I'm not gunna charge a friend a large price for combineing 2 items they have).  Which means I quite simply can't afford a 10pp reg for the rune IV and higher spells.. I just can't.  Especially considering these wear out quickly and are not 'renuable' like the cleric reg-buffs are (they add to your HP, meaning it can be restored, the spell doens't drop when the damage is done)<P>I think that you should re-evaluate the component for this spell and make it a less costly one.<P>so in summary:  <P>(1) enchanters at high levels in PvP are helpless both in offense and defense (can't mez, believe me (defense)... and my nukes get resisted(offense)  I'm lucky if I get a gate off.<P>(2) Components for the RUNE series of spells are too expensive (i'm talkin post-jasper which is Rune III)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"The primary focus... or magically enhance the capabilities of their allies..."<P>In the realm of buffs I feel the enchanters are fine, we have haste/mana regen and a few decent melee buffs.  No real need to infringe on the other classes such as clerics/shaman in this realm.<P>Crowd control still remains our main focus and with the recent root "fixes" and velious mez problems we seem to be getting the shaft.  A possible fix for this might be to make mezzing velious mobs more charisma based, hard for those without maxed charisma but normal for those with high charisma, this would still allow us to be good crowd control but we might just have to work a little harder on it.<P>Also, someone mentioned enchanters overpowered at low levels, I find this insane, pre-20 enchanters are very weak, our pets and damage spells are very poor and other spells such as charm are much less powerful.  Even through mid-lvl we aren't as powerful as many other classes such as druids, mages, necros, etc in the realm of soloing, our main strength seems to be getting out of trouble if we get overwhelmed.  I don't feel any change to low-mid levels is warranted. <P>To me fighting for illusions is useless.  The effort to make illusions last on zoning doesn't seem altogether plausible since some illusions do not work in all zones.  Lasting through linkdeath would be nice but I'm sure its connected to the way eq removes illusion upon zoning.  Gender illusion and possibly a zone-specific illusion would be a nice touch I think.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>High level/Giant model encounters make enchanters feel pretty useless as you may already know.  Instead of a powerful spell that affects the mob why not give enchanters some sort of super buffs that are only applicable in big encounters. <P>For example:<BR>A short duration (30 seconds?) haste spell that casts quickly, refreshes quickly, stacks with all haste, and adds 100% haste (And uses a ton of mana). (Or a 150-200% haste spell that overwrites others and lasts about a minute).<P>This would allow enchanters to manadump on big raids and tough fights, making a significant but not overpowering difference via melee buffing.<P>Also: GROUP RUNE SPELLS!<P>Just my two cents.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Greetings, i want to thank you for taking the time to do this to enchanters. we've needed this done for a while.<P>ok i know this has nothing to do with anything but i just thought i'd being it up. in duels or competitions or pvp enchanters are kinda screwd due to Magic resistance. if anyone has semi-decent MR like say 50+ then our spells bounce off them and it no longer becomes a duel. its "hi will you beat me up?"<P>anyway on to the idea/fixes.<P>Whirl till you Hurl spins the mob on PC's but not Npcs.. one of the main reasons i bought this spell was to see mobs spin.<P>Gravity flux 2, Please bring it back  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>we need another Mana drain spell at higher levels. and our Mana seive should steal mana as well.<P><BR>Fear - All mobs receleive ultra super fantastic haste when Feared and not snared.<P>Pets. ok this i will have to explain. Enchanters do not receive pets, we get "animations" wich is why we cannot control them, however as a bonus for Not being able to control them, sence they dont have a soul or feel pain, they are essentually BERZERK, wich means they can go "Balls out" so to speak, as it is enchanter animations have INCREDIBLY low Hp making them almost non usable. any enchanter worth his or her salt solos without pets. so i would suggest drasticly incresing their average hit sence they Cannot feel pain and essentually are Spinning Dishes and daggers. i watched my 49 pet fight a Spiroc to half life. out of 100 attacks. 70+ of them were either Misses or 10 damage - 39 damage. only 30 or so of them were hitting for 52. sence it cannot feel pain and has no mind is why i suggest this. not to mention we cant controll it.<P>also as for 49+ pets, i think there needs to be More of them. necros get pets every couple levels. our 1 pet before 60 is pretty much the same with a Small ammount of hp differance... that needs to be fixxed.<P>also high level enchanters in RP, are not going to want to Protect themselfs with "Tiny daggerS" they would use Mithril Daggers or want to enchant a Spinning dual edeged axe or something, i think personally speaking of corse, when i started playing everquest. i looked forward to being able to pick up a weapon from the ground.. casting Enchant weapon. and have it float next to me this aside from illusions was the reason i started one. so we should beable to enchant weapons from our INV and use them 1 or 2 at a time.  for balance issue they can have the Same delay as they would normally.almost any other online RPG has a class that enchantes weapons from inventory. most of us grew up playing MUDS and this is what people want. I.E. Weigted axe.. its what we do. and who we are  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> every class has an area of expertiese. necros dot like MAD, mages have insane pets with one katrilion HP and nice rain spells. we enchant things. its all in how you use it. so i suggest either enchanting weapons or new pet componants for better pets. our buyable Focus items if you will..<P>Effects - one thing this game needs is effect eye candy. its hard to get "lost" in everquest because there arent many more newbies left. part of bringing the Splendor back into everquest is turning BACK on my spell effects and watching the magic fly. <P>Bla bla is surrounded by a shield of words,<BR>Show the shield of words  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> if i was any level and i saw a guy run by me with a bunch of words id be SO happy i bought this game and my friends watching me play would probably want to give you their money as well<P>a lot of people dont say it but there are Certin things that turn people on to the game. Werewolf form, weapon Procs.. dragons etc.<P>Spell effects would be a Great investment in time <P>maby enchanters should be the first to experiment with these? for example to see what i mean. Cast Sentinal on yourself and hit F9 a few times. You are surrounded by a Sphere of Light. very very pleasing to MYSELf.. sad to say no one else can see it i learned. i was running around Felwithe in werewolf form with sentinal on and i thought id be a Comet. none of the newbies could see the light hheh<P>this is the kind of thing im talking about. sorry if im ranting but these things ive been wanting somone to see for a while.<P><BR>Illusions. DEFINANTLy more illusions after 44.<P>Sarnak, Frogs etc. Popular races are a must.<P>im all for Major illusion being any mob in the zone. weather its a coding problem or not. problems are esally solved once you apply yourself  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>the question is how much longer can you keep us happy? <P>Root - No matter what root we get its always the same. it breaks WAY too esally. serves absolutely no purpose after the spell "Root" itself. enchanters are using Mez in place of root. i've watched necros put 4000 damage worth of dots on a mob while it sits there and is rooted. i hit my mob with a 500+ DD and it comes after me.<BR> i suggest something at 49 maby like Feet of Stone wich is a FIXED duration root  1 minute or 2 minutes or whatever. by the time we cast Tashxxx we are ALLREADY on its "People to kill today" list.<P>Your spell effects: <P>Sometimes your spells get debuffed from people and you have no idea.like if you cast aug on a tank and a mage type dispells it. it would be Cool from a RP point of view AND an eye candy point of view if some parts of their body could Glow. maby their feet, muscles could look like they have glowing arm bands.<BR>sorry but for new ideas. this looks like the place. might as well get my moneys worth and toss em out  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Charm:<P>ok this has bugged me for a Long time.<P>i have 200+ int and my mobs never stay charmmed for more than 5 minutes. 5 minutes is decent. but for 200 int ive had specters guard me for 10 minutes or so. a high level enchanter would have learned how to Keep mobs in Check. Random duation effects on spells is NOT the way to go all the time. this 48 seconds Fixed duration is emberassing. at high levels we need a Fixed duration of like 8 - 15 minutes our RANDOM charm with 200+ int is almost 99% of the time GUARENTEED to be more than 48 seconds. the mana cost for the assurance of 48 seconds is not worth it.<P>Summoning:<P>Mobs summoning me should have mana instead of "This mob has no mana to take" msg.<P>Memorize Location:<P>Enchanters are Mental masters. Psionists if you will<BR>we should beable to Commit a Location to memory and Beable to Gate back to that spot. it has a Spell effect duration like any other spell. Valor or clarity etc.. goes away in maby 10 minutes. so have that spell "Recall location" Ready to cast. i can see people abusing this but yet you wont have to look for for people abusing it.. is it really abuse? or people using their skills to the Utmost..dont hate me because im Gooooood.<P>Memorize Creature. this can be tossed around by anyone but ill throw it out there. <P>say your fighting the Ghoul Arch Magi. if you Memorize him he dissapears. you have a spell effect on you called Project mind or some such thing. lasts 5 - 10 minutes or something.<P>later you can project your mental Image of that mob in a Long duration charm. sence its your Mental image theres no chance of charm breaking.. its like an animation accept of corse it may or may not drop items.  you should be able to memorize anything you can charm regularly. <BR>this would obviously be a high level spell. and no i dont mean 60. by 50 &lt;what used to be the top&gt; you've pretty much Established your mastery of your art unless of corse you got power leveld the entire way.. but it would be fun. to whoever reads this i thank you.<P>Banisher of Edgedhonor<P>-=The Rathe=-</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Most of my concerns have been covered already. A few I'd like to make though:<P>1) /target range is too short. This affects us because we (and shamans) are the two classes most commonly using it to buff other groups. I know you feel there is a possible PvP issue here, but increasing it to at least the same range as Speed of the Shissar (which is pretty pathetic as well) would be nice.<P>2) /target can't target people who are invisible, even if you have see invis. Bug. It will also occasionally not target people using an illusion or rogues that hid and then broke hide via attacking.<P>3) Only gem vendor in all of Velious is in Thurgadin. Only place to buy velium bars is in Thurgadin. So we can't decide to kill dwarves without overly harsh penalties if a jeweler (no, I cannot reasonably mule 6000 plat to buy bars every week).<P>4) Gift of Brilliance is NOT any good as it is currently. Yes, it has use, but the mana cost is too high for the entire line. All three of these spells should be 1/3 to 1/2 their current cost. Alternately, make them a group spell. A third option (and not one I really support, as it dilutes necros) is to make it instant mana - Gift of Mana would instantly give 50 mana, Insight would give 100 mana (plus a 1 mana/tick effect), Brilliance would instantly give 150 plus the 2 mana/tick.<P>I would still very much like to see these spells revised to be better. Toss the +mana effect and give an improved clarity effect. The +mana is really quite useless.<P>5) Equipment. We need AC, as so many others have said. Why is it that the Velious quest armor is the same AC (or only a slight improvement) over planar armor. The Kunark armor for melees and healers was a VAST ac improvement. Seems odd. And while the Velious loot in general is better for casters than the Kunark loot was, it's still considerably less. <P>Also the effects we do get are very weak. The robe casts Rune4 which takes a peridot and 25 seconds to cast. This absorbs 400 damage. Clerics get a 2400 hp DOT (their L59 spell), shaman get their L54 stamina buff. It wouldn't seem unreasonable to get Rune5 at 18 seconds, or a stone-less Rune4 at 12. The aggro from rune is so absurdly high anyway that we're not going to be chain casting this. The legs cast Clarity, but take 15 seconds to do so. It's not a horrible effect - it would be useful for buffing newbies or quick starting mana regen after death except for this. Why not make it 7 seconds, the same cast time as on the rod of infinite thought from Innoruuk? As it is, I can med up the mana to cast a clarity in 18 seconds (if not 12). The items that cast stun (both from Velketor, helm and rod) have cast times so long they're totally useless. Change the effect to something else - you can't make an item with a right click stun that has a reasonable cast time and still prevents chain stunning.<P>The robe from Veeshan's Peak still has the useless L49 DOT on it. Change it to Group Resist Magic and you'd make a lot of people happier.<P>Llarn, Officer of Prophecy<BR>L59 Enchanter, Bertoxxulous</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>While I love working with Enchanters, and have never had any problems with it, I do question the thinking that their Clarity (or if it is called something else at higher levels) makes the Mana recouperation so high, that it renders a Bard un-needed, even for that, in the higher ends.<P>I really would like to find a way that all classes are needed at all levels, and not just a hand full at level 60. While I realize that some Enchanters here might not like this statement, I am only thinking of other players, not just myself. In intergroup mechanics, we should find a way to add everyone's abilities, not otherwise. Any decision in regards Enchanters, should not 'bring down" the Bard, and it's ability to even "help" the Enchanter at high levels.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Forgot to mention this earlier.<P>Please fix the "this spell is not ready message" on our quick cast spells. What happens is after casting a spell, and when our spell icons come back up if we try to cast a fast spell (stun or tash) we get a message saying the spell is not ready, when in fact it IS ready. I believe this was done to offset some sort of exploit in PvP, but is there anyway this can be fixed because it is super annoying and effectively is adding 1 second to recast time of these spells (double casting time often). I seem to remember once that VI was going to fix it so this would not happen with tash at least, but hopefully it can be fixed for the stuns too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>So far a lot of good suggestions. <P>1.  Make debuffs actually work on mobs.  Curse of the simple mind was the only one I ever used and that was only for Clerics of Innoruk in Hate.  That combined with Mana Sieve and ToT actually worked.  The whole Weakness line is useless on mobs. <P>2.  This is a bug more than a balance issue, make higher level mez spells overwrite lower level ones... make the Enthrall/Dazzle line overwrite Mesmerization.  <P>3.  Put the Tashan line back to the way it was originally.  By 44th level it's basically the same spell over and over.  It never seems to get above a 34 or 35 point debuff on magic resistance.  The Malosi line does much more than this.  At level 50 and above, I as an enchanter should be able to drop MR by 50 to 60 points since most mobs at those levels have insane resist rates as it is.  Not to mention that since Velious, enchanters can't duel anyone.  All the new gear has given players such high resists that you will be lucky if one spell sticks.  <P>4.  Absor, please explain to us how having illusions wiping religion AND faction would unbalance anything?  So what if I can walk thru a city completely safe... I still can't do anything.  If I attack a guard or NPC, I'm still going to get smoked by all the other guards.  If I go illusion troll and my name is bob... guards aren't going to look at me and automatically assume I'm bob the high elf in disguise.  Let us have a doppleganger illusion, so we can take the form of some random mob in a zone.  So I could go to Veeshan's peak... exactly what am I going to do there alone?  Nothing...   You've already implemented the corpse dragging hate list thing... so enchanters walking around with neutral faction/religion really wouldn't unbalance the game.  So please.... tell me how this would unbalance the game...  <P>5.  Make it so we can Mez giants.  I don't care about dragons because you wouldn't mez a single dragon anyway.  Keep the color line like it is so it won't work on giant mobs but make Mesmerize, and Dazzle work on them.  Those break the moment you do anything to the mob anyway.  <P>Fix the illusion bug.  On PvP is must really be killer.  You zone in and see a gnome that's 3 times the size of other gnomes... you know right away it's an enchanter.. and he's dead meat cuz h e can't do jack.   <P>The main problems with enchanters is insane resists at higher levels which makes them just buffers in big fights.  Debuffs that don't do anything ie the Weakness lines.  Mez spells that don't overwrite the lower level ones.  And Illusions that just don't work right and never have.. ie faction/religion.   Also, make illusions carry over from zone to zone and stay after LD.  Nothing sucks more than going LD in the middle of Neriak using Illusion Dark Elf then coming back to be beat into a pulp and do a corpse run.  <P>I'd also like to add that cultural armor is not even worth the effort to make.  The stats on it aren't even as good as Crafted Armor yet it costs several thousand plat to make some pieces.  Blue diamonds, Jacinth and the like are not easy to come by and once you enchant the ore with them, you have so many chances to fail in smithing that it's not worth doing.  Now if the armor had stats comparable to Planar gear.. maybe... since most of the gems you need drop either in the planes, Old Sebilis, or other 50+ level zones.  Besides, the enchant spells are 49th level.  All that just to make armor that is barely better than what a level 24 warrior can get from a quest.  <P><BR>Enchanters as they are can be the most powerful class in the game under certain conditions... but they can also be useless in others.. as with any class.  Just tweak some of our spell lines so they are more effective at higher levels.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ENCHANTERs AND MANA DUMP<BR>I would just like to comment on enchanter's inability to donate their mana to other players.  Its very strange that necromancers should get this ability while enchanters do not.  Alan said himself that he is against dispersing spells or abilities over classes.. This makes each class less unique.<BR>Necromancers have the lifetap line and at an early level are able to pact life to other players.  Enchanters now have the mana theft ability(Theft of thought and wandering mind), but are UNable to donate mana to other players.  We are allowed to cast clarity on other characters (whose message is "a cool breeze slips through your mind), but are unable to actually donate mana to them. We also have other mana buffing spells, but can do nothing to do the best mana buff in the game --&gt; give more mana.  Enchanters are masters of this field, and necromancers honestly have no business getting a mana dump spell.  I realize that this spell was added to necromancers in an attempt to make them more "group friendly" ..  Fine then, make them group friendly, but give us the spell too because it's unreasonable that we shouldnt have it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>     I would just like to say that most of my concerns about enchanters have been touched in the posts I read, but here are a few of my ideas.<P>1)I do feel that tashan has to much of a taunt. Personally I do not feel It should have a taunt at all. In and of itself it does not damage the mob(although it does set them up for more dangerous spells). Perhaps of course to some more "intelligent" (such as casters) mobs they would know what is happening to them a could react as such. <P>2)As far as the illusions go I think it would be cool to have a copy cat illusion. I do not understand why it would be so unbalanced. So we would be able to go to some places without being aggroed on. This is not much different from invisiblity. I would also prefer if illusions did not drop on zoning. The primary reason would be to be able to make people truly think you are a gnome, or dark elf , or whatever else you like. I also understand that you do not like the Idea of illusion spirit wolf giving Spirit of the Wolf, but to be honest I do not see the reason for concern. What is the big deal about enchanters having a self only sow at mid levels? This would not cause druids or shamans to be any less needed. They would still need to sow the group,heal,and provide DD. All it does is to help the enchanter get around a bit faster when they are alone. I also agree that illusions can and should be used as tools, so please do not had new illusions just for the hell of it if they dont do anything. Some new illusions with bonuses would be nice as well as maybe some illusions that could target others. Also if enchanters are to be the illusionist of Norrath then I do not see why they should be limited in what they can mimic. Not that others should not be able to "change shape", but  I do not feel that any illusion should be off limits to the "illusionist" of the world. Keep in mind that does not mean in my mind that the enchanter should get all the abilties that come with a form another class gets.(if any)55 <P>3) Finally I have some questions about bards and enchanters. I have no problem with bards getting many of the same spells enchanters do. My question is why do the rules seem to change for them. For instance they get invisiblity. However unlike most other caster's invisibilty, theirs last for as long as they sing it with no chance of them becoming visible again with little or no warning. Thus no risk for them. Chanters dont get a set invisibilty spell until somewhere in there 50's. Also they recieve a charm spell that has a set duration with no mana cost. This allows a bard to charm a mob stand clear wait for it to break with safety (since they know when this will happen) then charm that target agin. Since bards do not have to worry about spell disruption it appears to be far safer than an enchanter's charm.<BR>Bards also recieve an area mez a level before enchanters do. While I do understand that it does have a high resist, it still is free of mana and in a fight they could easily use this even if they only get one or two mobs it seems worth it.<P>     Well just some food for thought hope it helps with some of your choices.<P>P.S.<BR>Many people say that enchanters are overpowered, well I'm still waiting to see this (granted I am only 25th lvl). So plse dont "nerf" things yet. Wait till I hit 60, then I will send you an email and you can nerf away : ).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My suggestion to balance the enchanter class is to decrease the magic resist of all spells.  For example why do we have to over come the magic resistance of a creature and the plus you put on all the spells.  Lowering it by say 15 points for all spells would be a start.  The only other thing that comes to mind is to lower the aggro of our spells.  It is to high.  I cast spells and they are resisted and the mob comes straight at me and forgets that the other people are the ones that have almost killed him when I have done no damage to him.  Just thought of one more change lower the casting time on some spells.  I hate casting 3 spells on a yellow mob and the battle is over (everyone else is a lower level than me in the group).  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hey I wanted to post a couple things, even though it is late in the discussion.<P>On unmezzable creatures:<BR>It is wrong to make the game harder by arbitrrily denying a class's base attributes.  The 'Giant' flag is a huge example of this, aimed directly at enchanters.  I think that in the name of balance enchanters should get an enhanced root to use in these situations.  This would allow us to maintain the role as crowd control in unmez situations without too strongly disrupting the existing game mechanic.<P>On stuns:<BR>If a creatue is unstunnable, it should resist the stun.  This doesn't happen for giant types--it says they are stunned but they just keep pounding. In the spirit of the above paragraph unstunnability shouldn't be an absolute, but howerver it is implemented, the notification should be consistent with the actuality.<P><BR>On memory blur:<BR>Either make it work consistently or give an indicator of failure.  The 55 one doesn't work any better than the low level one on creatures over level 50, which is to say it hardly works at all.  I was in summon/blur loops 3 or more recasts long ten times tonight, which is pretty often for &lt; 53 mobs.  Fixing the recurring mez would go a long way towards this, and save a few ranger lives as well.<P>On charm:<BR>The whole game needs a 'this creature is charmed' message when it happens.  No reason it couldn't be the same 'who is your leader' emote, just server triggered when charm takes hold.<P>On minimum durations:<BR>Fear, Root, and Charm need minimum durations of as least one tick.  In velious they often wear off before the cast is complete at the client end, leaving the enchanter with no clickable command input while he is pounded to death.<P>On debuffs:<BR>Many have complained that melee debuffs have no effect. That's incorrect, because I've seen thier effect.  The problem is that they peter out on creatures at about level 55. Enchanters don't have any melee debuffs above level 53,  and debuffs are sorely needed for higher encounters.  Since shamen have better spells in the same debuff lines (slow, magic debuff) this places the enchanter is the position of either doing nothing because a shamen is there or doing little because a shaman isn't there.  This needs to be balanced by providing enchanters only with a melee debuff spell (a Cripple upgrade, basically) at level 56 or 57. We need to see a melee buff that has a visible effect on a 6 member level 58 party's survivability againt level 53 to 60 melee creatures. The enchanter is the best place to put it, because enchanters start becoming fifth wheels jsut when this would be useful.  I wouldn't have any problems with a minimum level limit on this spell--say it doesn't affect creatures under level 54.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I had thought once i got my epic a little bit of the hassle of buffing would be reduced but noooo now its even worse EVERYONE wants shissar and they think because my weapon casts it I should hand it out like popcorn. This item has a 7 second cast time during which i cant do anything else and its annoying. All the other classes epic effects are useful for the character that has em. Tell me what use is speed of the shissar for me? Am I now gonna go melee some fire beetles? Since it seems ive been relegated to the role of "shudder" a buffer can you atleast make this an instant cast or make the effect last a lot longer? Considering that besides thw stats on this item, which are no better than any other epic It isnt a very useful item(to me personally).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One thing that I would like to have looked at is the lower level DD's.  They have a stun factor added to them that stuns a mob only for a brief second, and while this would disrupt casting, very few people under level 30 fight alot of casters.  Because of the coding for the DD/Stun combo, however, the spell is an "all or nothing" spell.  It is either resisted, or it isn't.  I personally would prefer not to have the stun component in favor of having partial resists.<P>Graack, Shaman of Xegony<BR>Aariakus, Enchanter of 7th Hammer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First of all, I'd like to point out that I'm only level 51. So if I talk about post 50, know that I have little experience in that field myself. Regardless, I've talked to other people, read comments on spells, and just spent silly amounts of time getting to 51, so what I write is not complete nonsense. *smile*<P>Enchanters in the old world were maybe a bit too powerfull. Not in a sense that we could kill monsters easily without any danger, because we can't. But because we made it possible for a single group to go nearly everywhere, do their thing and get back out again. In fact, without enchanters, a fair number of places in the old world would need more than one group do be 'done' successfully with people of lvl50 or less.<BR>Now while there's nothing wrong with being able to do crowd control, Enchanters were just too good at it. At 50, you could easily keep 3 to 4 monsters mesmerized without ever going out of mana. In a game where the toughness of an encounter is based on the number of opponents and not their intelligence, this isn't a good thing.<P>And then there was Kunark and another 10 levels. The new spells Enchanters got, certainly pleased a lot of non-enchanters. Clarity 2, Haste upgrades, and an Augmentation upgrade. Everything we used to give to others, we could now give more. But in the field of crowd control, I can't help thinking we didn't gain much, if anything at all. And from overpowered, we became balanced I think. Not because monsters were much harder to mez by themselves. Being able to mezmerize still had a lot to do with levels, but because Kunark monsters hit very hard. And that's very important. In the old world, it wasn't so bad if you got resisted and took a few hits before you could give it another try. In Kunark that was no longer the case. If you get hit, you can die in seconds as an (unbuffed) enchanter. It was something I, and I think Enchanters in general, had to get used to. Not being able to 'tank' for even 10 seconds untill your mez gets through. I can still do crowd control well in places but it's never as safe as it was in the Old World. I'm not longer the pause-button that works 99.9% of the time.<P>And then there was Scars of Velious.<BR>There are several ways of looking at Velious. For me, Velious is a continent geared towards people who have done everything else already. Twice. It's got the dragons, it's got the high level monsters, it's got the shiny new loot, it's got the quests (rewards) everybody wants to do, it's got all that, and probably more. It's a continent for raids as far as I'm concerned. And raids aren't done with a single group, the place where enchanters shine.<BR>But on the other hand, Velious was sold as a continent for level 35+ people on these very boards. And it's true that there are several places where you could go with a single group. And I've tried that a few times. But I ran into so many creatures I could hardly cast a spell on, so many creatures who kept resisted spells they shoudn't, and so many creatures who could kill me in mere seconds without any chance of defending myself that I gave up on Velious.<BR>So I have a problem. I find Enchanters a bit too powerfull in the old lands, balanced in Kunark, and unplayable in Velious. Same enchanter with the same spells. I'm not sure how you could fix them in Velious without 'breaking' them in the old lands and Kunark.<P>Fact is, being an Enchanter in Velious isn't any fun. It's so bad, that I more or less gave up on him and started a warrior. For a character that I've played since May 1999 that's a sad thing really.<P>Kind Regards,<P>Cixi Evenstar,<BR>51 Illusionist,<BR>Adventurer of Fervir,<BR>Rodcet Nife.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>After reading through six pages of posts (sorry, all I had time for)....I have noticed that certain things are mentioned repeatedly, and thus I have some hope that these will be addressed.  However, the many of these problems are the way the are because the alternatives were seen as overbalancing.  With this in mind, even though some parts of this post may seem redundant, I will address these issues once again for two reasons:  1)  Repetition stresses the importance.  If the majority of those who play the class agree that a spell is useless as written (i.e. Lull), then perhaps it truly does merit change.  2) Although we most of us agree about what the problems are, a nearly endless variety of solutions have been proposed.  Hopefully, in the morass of possible fixes for the problems will be one solution that will both satisfy those who play the class and those whose job it is to keep the various classes balanced.<P>Prior to proposing any changes, I wish to make a brief comment about class balance and enchanters.  The statement that they are overstrong at low levels concerns me.  This is NOT the case.  Granted, under certain circumstances (multi-mob pulls in dungeons) they are indespensible and can make an otherwise disastrous pull survivable.  Does this make them overly powerful? NO.  It makes them a specialist class.  They solo less effectively than most mobs, and if you are NOT in an area where multi-mob pulls are commonplace, you are relegated to you _secondary_ role of buffer/ debuffer.  Thus, rather than being overly powerful, they are simply very good at one thing..crowd control.  <P>That being said, the pre-50 levels do not need any major changes to achieve balance.  Sure, we cant solo, but that doesnt mean we need better pets, better DD or snare.  That is simply the penalty we pay to be so valuable in crowd control (again, we are _specialists_).  As I have not played the post-50 game yet, I cannot directly address their issues, but I am concerned that those who have post here believe that our class defining abilities of crowd control have been completely eliminated.  In my opinion, this is the equivelent of making warriors unable to hit any of these mobs.  Sure, they would still have the secondary abilities of taunting mobs off of the casters and absorbing damage while the wizards kill them, but they would no longer be able to perform one of their primary functions.  <P>The changes I would like to see (roughly in order of priority) are:<P><BR>Lull:  This spell is useless in almost all conditions (the only exception being breaking up a pair of low resistance mobs - and there are other ways of dealing with that situation).  The biggest problem is that it is single target, highly resisted and aggro.  Of these, the fact that it is aggro is the biggest problem.  Keeping it a single target, non-aggro spell with a fairly short duration (say one min, or even random with a check once a tick) would make it useful, but NOT overly powerful, as you try to get the spell cast on all of the mobs in the camp before the first one wears off so that the party can break the camp.  Outdoors, you are still much better off with a single casting of  Harmony and indoors the spell becomes useful, but still dangerous to use (as the lull wears off of one mob while you are standing in the middle of the camp casting lull on another mob) and limited.<P><BR>Illusions and Religion:  As did many of us, I chose to worship a god before I found out how limiting that would be (I foolishly believed that the illusion spells would still work to allow travel).  However, given the mechanics of the game, I do believe that actions should have consequences, and I do not believe that casting a dark elf illusion should necessarily allow one to completely negate ones previous actions.  However, the illusions should 'obscure' ones choice of religion.  In other words...Casting an illusion should carry with it an emulation of agnosticism.  Since I dont know how faction information is stored, I dont know how difficult this is.  If faction is stored as a base value (race+religion) modified by subsequent actions, then modification of the religion value is no more difficult than is the modification of the race value.  If, on the other hand, the original starting number is lost, and your faction versus any group is stored as a single number (the combined sum of starting faction, including religion, as modified by actions), this is more difficult.<BR>	If this is the case, than a more difficult solution may be necessary.  One possible solution (which has been suggested before, such as the faith mask (god) suggested yiktopo, which will give the player the starting faction of a newbie character of that religion.  To make this spell a little less powerful, I would give it two important weaknesses:  1) It is of random duration (like invis) and 2) it breaks if the caster performs certain activities (like scale of wolf).  This spell should be of high enough level that it comes after all of the standard illusions, but NOT post 50.<P>Copy cat illusions :  There are two reasons why enchanters want to have more interesting and varied illusions.   The reasons can be summoned up as entertainment and security.  Those who want these illusions for entertainment purposes simply want the ability to assume the form and dont care if they remain KOS to the mob and get no benefits from the form.  Those who want security want the ability to assume the form of the mob and would like some added benefit, either in the form of benefits (i.e. resistence, str, etc) or faction (no longer KOS to that type of mob).  Both of these are legitimate desires, and both can be answered, by providing two spells:<P>Illusion: Minor Monster (49th).  This spell gives the caster the shape and appearance of a randomly chosen mob already present in the zone.  As is the case for the magician summon monster spell, the illusion is tinted differently than the mobs already present and thus can readily be distinguished from the native mobs, both by players (thus allowing targeting) and by the mobs (thus giving no faction benefit).  This spell neither adds to the global file requirements (or no more so than does the monster summoning spell) nor does it add to the enchanters ability to travel with impunity.  This spell would be a logical progression at approx 49th level.<P>Illusion: Major Monster (55th+).  This spell also gives the caster the shape and appearance of a mob already present in the zone.  However, it also makes the caster indifferent to mobs of this type.  Because coding specific benefits for each illusion type is prohibitive, no other benefits are given.  The benefit of this spell (the ability to travel around other mobs of a specific type) is outweighed by the following requirements: 1)  The type of mob to be 'copied' must be targeted.  2) The spell has a short range and is actually cast upon the targeted mob (the mob is copied).  Although this spell is unresistable and non-aggro, it does have a long casting time (10+ sec). 3) This spell _Does not_ wipe aggro lists..any mob already aggro will remain so, as will any mob whose 'hate list' has picked up your name.  The combination of these limits will effectively limit its usefulness to mobs that are low enough in level that you can walk up to spell range and cast the spell, without having them attack you and thus disrupting its casting.  <BR>	<P>Pets:  I can accept the fact that our pets are weak and that we have little control over them.  However, I find it ironic that the masters of crowd control have the only pets that CANNOT be prevented from breaking their own mezzes and enthralls.  Because they are supposed to be purely defensive, it makes sense that they only come into play when we are attacked, however a way to make them stop attacking mezzed and enthralled mobs would be very useful.  The ideal would be for our pets to be unlike every other pet in the game and recognize when a mob is mezzed and NOT ATTACK THEM.  However, I find it unlikely that you would give us this.  Instead, I would like the abilty to order our pets to back off.  No other commands, just this one.  Or, as an alternative command, which wipes its aggro list, causing it to forget which mobs have attacked you in the melee (returning it to non-attacking status if neither you nor it take any damage after it is cast).<P><BR>FInally:  Although I know the primary focus of these threads is to balance already existing abilties, rather than to consider whole new abilities which would require a new round of balancing, I would like to propose the following:<P>Single target invis:   A high level invis spell that only affects a single mob.  It is cast upon the mob (and thus can be resisted) and prevents that mob from seeing the enchanter.  This spell should have a long duration (in line with the benevolence spells) and NOT break when the enchanter casts spells, loots corpses etc.  However, this spell will NOT make the enchanter immune to hate lists, etc.  Thus, any attack against the mob or any nearby mob will result in the enchanter 'coming to the mobs attention'.   Off the top of my head, I would make this a 50th+ level spell.<P>Mirror Image:  This spell is designed to solve the high aggro problems of the enchanter.  It is a varient of a pet, and as such you can either have an image or a pet, but not both.  It looks like a ghostly (or in some way different) copy of the caster (naked caster look).  However, the advantage of this mob is that all spell effects cast by the enchanter appear to have emerged from the mirror image and thus when the mega-taunt spells go off and enrage the mobs, they will attack the mirror image, and not the actual enchanter.  This image should have hp approx identical to the enchanter and be buffable, but NOT have any attacks.  The marginally higher hp of the mob would be offset by its lack of attacks.  An alternative, if readily codable, would be for DD spells to originate from the enchanter, but for the more subtle spells, suchas mez, tash, etc to appear to come from the image.  <P>Magic Items:  Many have suggested that the viscous, etc mana line should be more useful, and I suspect that it will become more so as designers find time.  However, one idea that has not been used to date, and which has been dismissed as unbalancing and 'making certain classes unncessary' is the creation of items (ideally rings or some such) which can cast effects.  The solution I would like to propose is as follows:  A magical item can be made which is lore (thus you can never have more  than one of a type) and can cast a single effect.  To make such an item, you need:  enchanted metal, gem, scroll of spell, viscous mana line spell, imbued gem, looted component.  Each of these items is there for a specific reason:  <BR>	The enchanted metal and gem will determine what is made (i.e. ring, etc), as well as adding a specific cost to the item. <BR>	The scroll of the spell provides the magic behind the effect.  <BR>	The viscous mana line spell is to require the involvement of an enchanter of a specific level - in other words, the higher level the effect (or the less available you want the effect to be), the higher level of mana spell needed.<BR>	The Imbued or enchanted gem (using the currently implemented spells) is to require the involvement of a caster capable of casting the given spell....In other words, a recipe for a shaman spell, such as sow, would require a shaman to cooperate in the creation of the item by providing the imbued gem.<BR>	Looted component:  This is simply to reduce the availability of the item.   These components can either be common (such as wolf pelt) for some spells, such as a sow or very rare for spells which are more powerful (such as gate).  By carefully chosing the component, the availability of these items can be regulated.<BR>	The end result of this is the ability to make single use magic items which are lore.  Thus, althogh it is still better to have a caster inthe party to actually cast the spell, you have the ability to cast a given spell ONE TIME.  This is not unbalancing and will be difficult to exploit, but will result in the creation of a number of useful items.  Note:  Other items besides jewelry can also be created in a similar fashion, such as bracers with a single charge of a spell.  Obviously, any given spell effect will require a specific recipe and you can implement as many or as few recipes as you wish...For example, as a test implementation...You can create five items (for five slots), for some useful, but not overpowering spells (i.e. Invis (silver), Sow (electrum), Clarity (gold), Superior Healing (platinum), and Gate (velium).  If this is implemented, some attention should be paid to cost, as few of these spells are going to be worth more than twenty or thirty plat..a fact which currently invalidates the majority of the already implemented alchemy potions...as such, given the presence of a multiple gems, means that silver, electrum and gold are the only metals  which can be used (with the possible exception of gates).<P>Syrtalis Syrsuro, E.

</FONT><HR>Back for seconds....<P>This one jumped out at me too....<P>&lt;Absor-<BR>Keep in mind that there is nobody that knows anything about EverQuest that doesn't worry that enchanters are already overpowered, even those that play enchanters. This applies to a few other classes as well. So keep in mind that by taking a careful look at this class, I may very well be prompted to suggest a reduction in the power of something. This is just as important as the increase in power of things to maintain a balance. I'm not telling you that this is my intent, just letting you know that it could happen.&gt;<P>That, and the later comment about altering the copurse of the battles in velius buy wanting to use the mez line, tend to give me the impresion that YOU think mez is overpowered.  That may be the quick and easy way to look at it....<P>If you want to change it, go for it.  Hybrids had a 40% adjustment to their exp needs... guess what, chanters (and close behind bards) have upwards of a 100% penalty in exp.  Chanters die.... we die more than any other class.  While we can control the battle sometimes, and yes, make it easier for our group... when the least thing goes wrong... we DIE.  Change mez... then you better look into our exp penalty.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;On the illusions dropping at zone thing. Please leave that as is. As a bard with my illusion masks, there are times I need to zone to drop em. I can't really walk around FV as an iksar...&lt;&lt;<P>Absor&gt;&gt;Educate me on this. Can't you just click the illusion off? &lt;&lt;<P>You can tell it's a bard sticking his nose in an't you :-) Bah ghetto-chanters.<P>Absor&gt;&gt;Normally I would pass this one. But you got me thinking. You see, I'm perfectly fine with enchanter suffering like everyone else with their religious choices&lt;&lt;<P>Well that would be ok if there was a balancing advantage. I chose Innorukk for role-playing reasons, but even that has no benefit to either game-play or my enjoyment (if anything quite the opposite).<P>&gt;&gt;To be honest, I feel that the enchanter class is a little overpowered in the early levels.&lt;&lt;<P>Absor&gt;&gt;This is something that seems to be true.&lt;&lt;<P>I think you're wrong here. I do not think Enchanters are overpowered. Here's my reasoning:<P>1) At low levels they're basically mages with worse damage spells and a near worthless pets.<P>2) At mid-levels they are powerful. BUT the balancing factor, and I am sure anyone who plays or has played with, an enchanter would agree - IS THE RISK. Playing an enchanter has got to be the riskiest class. You play badly - you die. Your team plays badly - you die. Your team gets unlucky - you die. Enchanters are FAR more likely to be the only casualty in the group than any other class. I think you need to take that into account more when you're looking at balance.<P>3) High-level. Hmm. Well I'm "only" 43 so can't comment on the Uber-game above 50 (although frankly I think *FAR* to much attention is paid to those levels which MOST of your paying, and according to John most profitable, customers will never achieve - but that's another rant). That said - am I overpowered ? Two comments. Well I think I play my 'chanter pretty well. Don't I deserve to be powerful when I play a class well that's hard to play well (where is the skill in necro or druid kiting their way to 50 ?), and is risky to play ? Enchanters played badly don't generally get too far - they die to much. Second, if I am so powerful why do I have so much hassle getting into a pick-up group with strangers ?<P>&gt;&gt;Boon of the Garou - I'm assuming this spell was meant to only be cast on one person at a time since you can't have it on 2 people constantly. Is there a way of making the spell last 30 minutes but making it so you can only have it on one target?&lt;&lt;<P>Absor&gt;&gt;I see. So if the intent was to only have it work on one person, then raise the duration and the recast time to match (along with the mana cost), so that it's not as annoying to keep it up on that one person. Ok, that makes sense. &lt;&lt;<P>Two comments, with a 6 minute duration and a 3 minute re-cast time a skilled enchanter can maintain this on TWO people. Second, I would suggest part of the cost of this spell is that to keep it on two people you have to keep a spell slot committed to it. Seems perfectly reasonable to me.<P>&gt;&gt;Mez is currently fine as is in most areas, but I agree with whoever it was that said targeted mez should simply not be allowed like anti-undead DD so mana is not wasted on targets that can't be effected. &lt;&lt;<P>Absor&gt;&gt;I, actually, disagree with this. Partially due to the mechanics of it. The undead only spells have to check to see if the target is undead to see if it works at all. This is easy to report back. If I'm correct on how mez works (and you all know I might not be), there are just some monsters with a really high resist to it. So it's not checking the same way as a undead only spell (though, somehow, that doesn't sound right, and I'll look into it). But, mostly, I always thought that it was good that the enchanter had to know what he was doing. Making the class hard to play by forcing the player to actually know what the heck he or she is doing has always made the good enchanter player much better than the bad enchanter player. With enchanters more so than nearly any other class (though it could be said of bards too). &lt;&lt;<P><BR>Err I don't care about mechanics. If it's ok for clerics to be prevented from wasting mana by the system why is it ok for enchanters ? Either mezz and stuns and anti-undead DD's should all check - or none of them should. Or is it your intention that clerics should be playable with zero skill ?<P><BR> <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 16 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-11.html">11</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-12.html">12</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-13.html">13</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;14&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-15.html">15</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-16.html">16</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052139&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052139&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
