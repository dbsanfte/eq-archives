</FONT><HR>Ok, i'm going to bed soon  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>- The whole group friendly thing....sure we can dish out damage...but unless we significantly belt out dmg over every other class...we aren't gonna add to a group what another class that can "do things for the group" will end up doing.  I think we need something extra to bring to the table to be group friendly.  I suggested a skill that inherently lowers resists, increases mana efficiency, speed of casting, and ups dmg of all the spells of the ppl grouped w/ the wizard.  It's not a buff...and by the wizard imparting his knowledge to the group, they learn better ways of using magic.  &lt;--- maybe a bad or non-possible example, but group friendly skills we need.  Unless of course, we add positively destructive magicial dmg...but we all know that that's impossible because of how Agro works.<P><BR>- Also, I didn't see the inherent drop in magicial resistance mentioned.  Wizards feel that being our only type of dmg, we should have a lot lower resistances on our spells.<P>- Another thing...having defensive spells added to our list for us to survive an accidental overtaunt...you know, having a spell taunt for like 1,000,000,000 dmg to the monster just because it has a useless interupt cast added to it.  A defensive line to allow mobs to be pulled off u.<P>- What about the mentioning of the spells that cause overtaunt?  There's sometimes WAY too much taunt added to a spell just because it's "viewed good"....for example...any magicial based spell w/ an interupt casting tacked on has SUCH a high taunt rate.  U can blast once deep in a battle and do like 150dmg to someone else doing alot more, and u still get turned on due to the extra agro.  Wizards think that that should be lowered.<P>- Also, when we get full/parital resistance...the dmg agro registered to the monster should be partial dmg or no dmg if it was resisted partially or all together.  Why should the wizard get a full penalty of: Wasting mana on a resist, and getting the agro added up even though no dmg was done.  It's like having all the negative sides of casting a spell w/o any of the positive benefit of hurting it.  Some ppl even mentioned not having resisted spells cost mana (and partially resisted spells costing only partial mana.)<P><BR>Krytal.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Erf *gives up on bed now*<P><BR>- What about our sight lines that were to be improved ?  I didnt' see any mention of them in the post.  I remember reading about Shadow Step and the like TPing vertically up...but what about how bind sight sticks?  There were also suggestions to make the Shadow Step line of spells TP in the direction you are looking in so u know where u end up, the biggest question would be how far u traveled in that direction....also, ideas were given to deal w/ TPing into Agro camps/ranges...maybe a 5 second invis added after u rematerialize after Shadow stepping...maybe the Shadow step would detect and push you past the agro range of a monster.<P><BR>Krytal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>THANK YOU so much! I know it is just a list of concerns. I am saying thank you for listening. Course you didn't catch everything but since our thread was like 14 parts!!! ...I truly understand. Couple quick things cuz I am tired (rather late, looks like u should sleep too ...workin' ya late i see)...<P><BR>#1. Remove Item: Blink<BR>#2. Add Item: Look at Resists for ALL levels and spells!<P><BR>Reasoning:<BR>#1 - Blink<BR>============<BR> - This is really only gonna help in the solo realm outdoors<BR> - Groups would not want this b/c then people are randomly TPing all over place. Tanks running every which way. Clerics can't heal b/c now someone is outta range.<BR> - Would be plain suicidal in dungeons<P><BR>#2 - Resists<BR>=============<BR>I was goofin 'round tonight in Qeynos Hills doin' a quick run to see if the lil gnome necro was runnin' 'round. I got attacked by a Putrid Skeleton (level 8-10 mob maybe). I am level 36. I casted my level 34 Ice Spell - RESIST 3 times in a row. I switch to fire, resist ! I had my level 8 pillar AoE spell up (like I said, goofin' 'round a bit) and threw that down. Supposed to hit in 30s. Guess what it hit for? 5pts of damage!!!<P>Level 36 Wizard vs a Level 8 Putrid Skeleton. I have hunted these things before as a younger wizard and I do not remember this much problem w/ them. I thought at level 35 we were supposed to get an innate magic resist debuff w/ our spells!?<P><BR>That is just plain nuts! I have a REAL HARD time believing that I just got unlucky rolls. I mean completely RESISTED 5 times in a row w/ different elements against a mob 28 levels LOWER than me!<P><BR>Where is the reasoning behind this?<P>** Lures should be 100% UNresistable. They have poor mana/dmg ratios to begin w/ so the balance is already there if you make them UNresistable.<P><BR>WE NEED better resist charts b/c we are completely dependent on resists. Missing w/ a weapon 5 times is completely different than missing 5 times w/ a spell.<P>Thanks for reading (if you still are),<P><BR>Shenlung Tianzhu<BR>Level 36 Wizard of Brell who can't slay a Putrid Skele w/ his resisted spells</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi, throwing in my two cents.<BR>Iäm trying to polite, altought it's rather hard after this one. There is but few ideas, all from the player posts. And you either did miss the whole point, or ignored it, which i hope isn't the case. WE ARE NOT WHAT WE SHOULD BE. WE MAKE NO BEST DAMAGE IN ANY RESPECT. Sorry about the caps but seems like there's hearing problem at verants end. May you please look into it, not into some secondary spices. Mana regeneration isn't the answer in any way, it just let us little shorter down time, which i appreciate of course. <P>One post earlier you said there is lot of people from live team playing the game. How about taking pencil, paper and clock. Take time how long does it take to wizard burn his mana, how much damage he does and then compare it to other classes, especially to melee. This is the problem, we should be doing like double than them, but we are making half or one third. This is by your eyes master of fast damage ? Would nice to gain some of your real insights instead of those endless lists, so we would know if there would even point to complain, or do something else for while. You might also want to look into taunting that wizard spells do, they DO prevent us doing fast damage.<P>Let us be what you have promised, no less or no more. Hope you can take some criticism.<P>One pissed off Gnomish manabag without use.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

We ALL believe quite a significant overhaul is needed (and has been needed) for the wizard class to be fixed.  <P><BR>It isn't gonna be like the Paladin/SK adding a few spells from their parent class...moving them to lower lvls....and raising the caps on some abilities they already have.

</FONT><HR>I wanted to mention, a BIG POSITIVE step in the right direction was mentioned when I read in the enchanter thread that increasing natural meditation and making mana regen spells less effective (so as to not make an Enchanter NECESSARY to do dmg) is right on.  (I don't believe the rate at which clarity regens has to be changed at all actually...it'd basically be raising the meditation rate for everyone....and then clarity would do what it always did.)<P><BR>Also ANOTHER innovative idea:  Letting the Clerics be able to med while standing and possibly fighting.  YES, this is a great idea...no one wants to sit down and stay stationary, it's a game afterall...how much dmg will the cleric really add to the battle?  But it's much more satisfying than sitting there watching the battle and not being able to stand unless 2 heal someone.  I personally already had this idea for all casters....make it a 35+ thing....and maybe move the ability to med w/o a book to lvl 20.<P><BR>Look at tanks, they don't have sit and med especially at higher lvls.  We're going for a fun factor here, not an "unbalancing" power given to a class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan, thank you for your work.  This is a note to the entire Verant team.  I know that you are working hard to change things.  I am a lvl 32 Wizard and have never had another type of character.  I used to buy FPS games about every two weeks (yes, about $6-700 per year) and am a serious and avid gamer of every genre (FPS, RTS, SIM, MMOG, etc.).<P>I am already committed to the idea that if the Wizard community doesn't enjoy the results of this "balancing", then I am going to end my account entirely with Verant (possibly including avoiding PlanetSide).<P>I think you should probably realize that if I'm saying this out loud, there are at least a percentage of other people who are considering the same things.<P>I know that this is a serious issue for you, but please keep one VERY important thing in all of your heads at all times while you repair this class: This is a GAME, GAMES are meant to be FUN.<P>Thank you for all of your hard work, past, present and future.  <P>Good luck.<P>PS - please don't think that giving people of ALL classes a little too much firepower is going to adversely affect your game (please note the industry ripping successes of "BFG" based games).  Challenge/reward paradigms are important in game theory, but only if the reward is satisfying to the player, in subjective terms, not according to ANY preconceived game economy (e.g. if winning a chess game isn't satisfying to a person, that person stops playing chess, regardless of IOC rating -- the SUBJECTIVE surpasses the OBJECTIVE)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello, all. I am a Mage on Rodcet Nife. I don't want to Troll your Talk Thread--so please take my comments in context of a fellow caster. I wouldn't be commenting in your thread if Absor hadn't almost completely ignored the items we discussed in our own Magician Talk. Another point is I see where he suggests that Magicians are, in the overwhelming majority of Wizzie Opinion, too close in damage effectiveness to your Class.<P>Now, my fellow masters of the Arcane Arts, I ask you to examine this closely if you can. Many of you probably have never played a Mage--so you cannot empathize with our shocked response to the above opinion.<P>Yes, yes--a thousand times yes, Mages put out some serious damage. We shall never attempt to deny this. But I ask you to see that we pay a heavy price for this throughout our careers.<P>We pay the price for this damage by:<P>limitation in the kinds of damage we do<BR>lack of new or better spells each circle<BR>extreme casting time and mana costs<BR>lack of Mage specific items (or a great variety such as your class enjoys)<BR>many useless summoning spell series<BR>many a nerf to our pets again and again<BR>theft of our magick--given to meleers on their armor<BR>post 50 spells that can only be called twisted jokes: how would you like some summoned cake?<BR>no escape or travel magick of any kind<BR>no spells beneficial to a group (Coth notwithstanding) Damage shields, yes...but Druid version is superior<P>etc and so on. I don't want to turn this into a Mage Issue thread. My point is, the limitations to our class are so extreme I find it hard to appreciate your view that we do damage too close to your own. I know you believe our pets are the answer to everything, but you should realize that they are also the primary reason we are not wanted in a group. Absor's erroneous commentary to the contrary reveals he is clueless about Magician Issues and our experiences in the Game.<P>So, anyway...I'll disappear back into the Mage Thread.

</FONT><HR>First, I don't want a different character, I want to be a wizard.  Not a mage, not a druid, A WIZARD.  If I wanted to be something else, I'd play something else (I so have an alt warrior, monk, and enchanter, but I love my wizard).<P>Second, dont nerf bonds of force.  I always have someone to group with.  I don't solo, I only kite if it gets hairy.  BUT, if we have to run because of multiple mobs, I can BOF them and we have a chance (sorry, haven't evaced yet).  For me, it's a "oh oh, we aren't going to live, RUN".  If you're far from a port spot, evac is worse than dieing (kunark at around 30).

</FONT><HR>Seems a fairly comprehensive list.<P>A lot of the items were addressing the fact that wizards are rather bad at sustained damage output. This is good. Considering that the pure meleers are the kings of long-term damage, and they get too close to our short-term damage for comfort, any way to increase our spell-slinging stamina would be good in my book.<P>Here's some interesting numbers concerning mana efficiencies. Consider the lead clerics have over shamen and druids with Complete Heal (potentially over 10:1) over Superior Heal (about 2.3:1), and then consider the lead wizards (4:1) have over magicians or druids (3.2:1) in direct damage. <P>I also approve of adding more variety in spell damage types at each level. GZ used to say we had more direct damage types at our disposal than any other class, but this is no longer true. Druids have unrestricted-target cold, fire, and magic DDs, just like wizards do. Necromancers, of all classes, have poison, fire, and cold DDs. It seems only fair that wizards get a better selection of level-appropriate nukes. In this vein, why don't wizards get a magic-based nuke at level 60 to go with Sunstrike and Ice Spear of Solist?<P>Al'Kabor spells really do need something more. As it happens, 3 of the 8 Al'Kabor spells *do* already have an interrupt component, and it doesn't get them more use. Unless you mean adding an actual stun with a duration.<P>I like having AE snare just fine. I hope that doesn't get changed.<P>Someone else mentioned this, but I'll add it too. IMO, there needs to be more usable AE damage spells between levels 34 and 51. At 39, we just get an Al'Kabor spell, and at 44, we just get Gravity Flux, which is more a fun special-purpose spell than anything else. At 49 we get another Al'Kabor spell and Supernova, which is rather expensive. A mana-efficient pillar spell at 44 would be nice.<P>And as one minor addition, since enchanters get to have silly little items like changing the spell gem for Mircyl's Animation... well, I have a couple issues like that too. =)<P>ITEM: The level 4 spell Icestrike is a rain spell, but its spell gem has a green background instead of an orange one like every other rain spell in the game. Please correct this. Also, the level 50 Translocate has a yellow background. It should have a red one, since it is targetable. This might require a new icon to be drawn, since there doesn't seem to be a red gate icon yet.<P>If only all the other wizard issues were as easy to correct as this. =P<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Let me follow up on that request for bonds of force not to be nerfed.  First, from what I've read, no one wants to solo.  They want to group.  I don't want to solo.  I've tried it, it's dull.  BOF is a nice addition for groups.   Mass snare.  It's nice if you don't have anything resembling an enchanter.  You're hunting, you get too big of a pull.  The cleric is oom.  root wont hold.  Then nearest port is an hour run away.  What are you gonna do?  Snare them all, run, pray.  BOF doesn't cause quad kiting.  Lack of groups causes quad kiting.  Sorry for the rant, but I just used it and it saved our party.  Dont nerf BOF!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just as way of clarification. The Harvest icon bug for me occurs when I use an "click activation item" such as jboots, or temparate flux staff, or potions, etc. When doing this it causes the spell gem to pop back up from it's grayed state but I am still unable to recast it. Others don't have this problem so it likely has something to do with specific hardware/driver configuration (happens in all screen resolutions for me). My systems on which it occurs are both Athlon based CPUs, nVidia video cards, and DirectX8 (problem occurred on 7a as well). Hope this helps.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>nice list there.<P>About eye of zombie and the upgrade, i think that eye of zombie should last 1 min 30 sec's and the upgrad 2 min 30 sec, this would make the use of these spells alot better.<P>I think bind sight should be added in also, give the spell a range of the whole zone.<P>About nukes at higher lvl's with mobs that have 100k hp. At lvl 60 i have about 3000 mana and can only do a lil over 12000 damage.  Now 12000 is alot of damages yes but when a mob has over 100k hp 12000 is a joke, i would like to see a spell for all the spell bases that cost 100 mana and does about 700 mana, starting at lvl 58 or 59.<P>harvest should be 5 min pause till able to cast again, and no stun, but keep the 10 or even 15 sec cast time, and give no less then 900 mana.<P>Imbue Fire Opal Scroll is not somthing we should be talking about sence it does not have anything to do with ALL wizards.<P>Melee-proof NPCs, i donot think we need this, you guys will get hell from all the tanks, and i dont want to be drug along in a group just to kill one mob.<P><BR>Evacs and Abscond. If your not going to make these spells fizzal less, i would make the mana cost on these spell half of what they are now, nothing like lossing 300 mana on a fizzal.<P>Invisibility to Undead. not a bad spell but sence its self only make it last 10 min.<P><BR>Flaming Sword of Xuzl. This spell is a joke, it should be named Sword of Xuzl not flaming sence it does not flame. I think you should give it unlimited hp BUT only last for like 2 or 5 min on one mob then poof, aka wizzy dot but looks better.<BR>700 mana on somthing what will die in one hit from a green and not even do 100 damages SUCKS.<P>Al'Kabor line of spells. these spells totaly suck, i only memmed them to see what they looked like and never memmed again. the mana should be over half less then what they have now.<P><BR>Level Cap on spells. Wizards should not have any type of lcl cap on there spell, if a lvl 1 want to go up to a lvl 50 and nuke it, let them go, they wont kill it but atleast there spell will hit. Or take off the lvl cap after lvl 50, kind of a bonuse for playing a wiz.<P><BR>Percentage Damage Spells. i like this. there sould be a line of spells for this though with a max of 15 or 20% of there hp in one blast at a higher lvl type for the spell with a recast time of 5 min. OR make it a ABILITY kinda like harmtouch, starts outa at 5% and ends at lvl 60 at 15 or 20% of the mobs hp with a recast time of 1 eq day. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; DROOLS&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<P><BR>Increased mana regeneration. a idea here.. A spell line kinda like clarity but not as good.<BR>Players will get the first spell at lets say lvl 20 thats self-only that has 3 mana regen. Next second spell at lvl 34 giving them 6 mana regen. Last spell would be givin lvl 55 with 10 mana regen. The spell would last untill dead or you zone, and would cost 1 mana like harvest and able to stack with all claritys and manaskin+fa regen.<BR>Or not make it a spell but a ability sence, with the same upgrades as the spell part would have, we can pull blue mana from the air this fits nicely<P><BR>I think what be need to give the wizards the edge we need is to lower all Nuke type spells by 5 to 10% of total mana cost and add 10 to 20% damages to all.<P><BR>Blink Spell. i'm kinda lost on this one... Will the mob or the player poof away? if the mob that would make a train in some areas, and if player poof oh i fell in the lava,water,trap ect... <BR>  The spell does sound kinda neat though, if when cast upon you anything green would not atk you even if you set infront of it. now that would be sweet.<P>Well i'm pooped.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think that still some issues were left behind:<P>Group Desirability: Wizards won't be addressed in this issue? If the class is currently designed to solo so some other changes are needed:<BR>-- Either DoTs (that are the most mana efficient spells) or extremely high mana regen rate (or mana leach spell usable very often like a DD)<BR>-- Improved Snare like spells (or speed increasing spells)<BR>Again I urge you reread the discussions pages and see that this is the issue that is concerning many players. It is simple if you have guildmates to conduct you through the levels and only open your eyes to spell damage. Many proposals in this issue were made but none of them appeared on the list.<P>Useless spells: some sight spells, okeils' spells (a lvl 34 spell exactly the same lvl 8 mage spell that just costs way more mana?), some teleport spells due to locations (WKarana, Cazic, Skyfire)<P>Wizard and Druid compensation for having so little teleport locations on Velious and Kunark: before the expansions wizard and druids teleport spells had good coverage so that VI considered an advantage to these classes. The classes were designed forfeiting some of their power in a trade off for this advantage (which is not since everyone take advantages of it). But with the expansions these classes lost good coverage and therefore, accordingly to VI point of view, lost some advantages but received nothing to compensate it. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Perhaps they should have a spell of each damage type at every level."<P>Hope this will take into consideration our pillar/PB lines as well.<P>"lack of Mage specific items (or a great variety such as your class enjoys)" <P>the lack of wizard only items has been stated many times. i believe even mages have more items then us wizards<P>" Lack of groups causes quad kiting. Sorry for the rant, but I just used it and it saved our party. Dont nerf BOF!"<P>proven by the fact that druids are quad kiting as well. We need to gather the mobs all together then hit them all in one shot (this can get very expensive, mana wise.) a resist means you need to snare the resisted mob, get him in in with the others and resnare the bunch cause BoF is a short duration. druids snare last what, 4 mins? they can pull with snare and find more, gather them and kite them all with 1 snare. BoF doesn't make quad kiting any easier, just different. only time its easier is when there are 3-4 mobs all together to start with, and how often does that happen in a kiting area/outdoors</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>-Enstill with minimum duration is a wonderful idea, would help deal with multiple mobs, make it mez-like so a single point of damage breaks the Enstill. It wouldn't be preferable to mez simply because rooted mobs can still fight and cast.<BR>-Reducing Bonds of Force to a single target snare is an awful idea, many wizards use it to snare entire trains and make a hasty retreat as opposed to hitting evac. Leave BoF as an AoE and add a single target snare at level 20 or 24.<BR>-Paralyzing Earth...this is a wish list item for me but any chance it could be made into an AoE root-type spell for purposes of limited crowd control.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Thank you for the work, the post and the compilation.<P>I did want to say that getting rid of Bonds of Force is a BAD, BAD idea. Even if any other changes you give to us are everything we could ever dream of, quad kiting isnt THAT incredible, but wizards consider it one of their prides that, with skill and Jboots or Sow potions, they *can* at least do it.<P>Also, wizards need it for stopping trains, helping newbies, etc.<P>Finally, most wizards are sensitive and weary now. We have been patient for 4 years. No matter what "fixes" we get, it will be a while before we are confident again (if indeed the fixes really help). We are going to want to have Bonds of Force unless and until we feel we could lose it.<P>And anyway we DONT want to lose it at all. Its a great spell, and believe me, it does not overpower us.<P>Also, our rep with other classes and groups is bad now, real bad. Wizards need this for the times they are /shouting "Wizard 48 lfg" or whatever, when they have to wait for 2 hours. And with our rep being pretty bad, even if we got every fix in the world, it *will* take a long time to repair our reputation.<P>So, please leave Bonds of Force untouched. I dont know WHY any wizard would have brought its oddity in the spell line to your attention as a problem. I could understand if they brought it to you hoping for a lower level single target version.<P>Anyway, thank you again Absor, thanks for the work and the patience.<P>Animated</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't see anything on the list that really addresses the MAIN concern of wizards. Our primary concern, as a question of BALANCE, is damage output over time in a group. I know you said you don't want to make major changes to any class or introduce whole new spell lines but this is the only way you will be able to save the wizard class. Either reduce the mana costs on current spells or add a new line of VERY efficent DDs.<P>Teleport points are NOT a BALANCE issue<BR>Al'kabor spells are NOT a BALANCE issue<BR>Other spells not working well is NOT a BALANCE issue<P>Many wizards have already suggested the needed spells should also have a long cast time or recast time because we know you don't want to improve our ability to solo. We agree, most of don't want to solo anyway. Please look at Solist's Ice Spear, it has a 4:1 ratio and a long recast time. This is the kind of spell we need for our entire carreer. In fact at level 60 the ratio should be at least 6:1. They should be close to TWICE as efficient as our existing spells at various spell levels.<P>Please take this seriously, wizards are not asking to be made uber powerful we are asking to be saved from extinction!<P>Aiyane N'Farre<BR>Retired Wizard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok....there are only a few thing's i would like to add.<P>1)  The invisibility to undead....dont nerf this PLEASE. It is one of the spells we actually have that helps in the GREEN MOB defense. Being a Seeker of Knowledge....least it helps us explore and seek for our knowledge  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>2) Why not make us a spell that is a aoe with dd and impending root that has very little resist to it. That way we can compliment the chanters and work together better. Least if we break thier mez's we could leave em rooted for a re-mez.<P>3)Make our roots last longer....tired of hitting mob once and it breaking. Or trying to med up for one more dd to kill it and having to go through a cycle of root-med's just to get enough mana to nuke it once. or finally giving up and runing after expending all my mana on the mob and not being able to med cause of resists....not to mention another 20 mins of no xp ....ever try to root a HG? or even run unsowed from one? <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You forgot one very important issue in your list, Absor:<P>Z-axis problems.<P>You listed them for the Shadow Step series of spells, but I am talking about Z-axis problems with our rain spells and our snare spells.<P>With both lines of spells, you have to be at an almost identical vertical height as your target or you simply cannot hit them -- much like the line of sight that bows/arrows use.  The only difference is that we just get the message "Your target is out of range" instead of the "Your target is too far above/below you" that you get with a bow/arrow.<P>This is extremely messed up.  No other classes have snares or damage spells that have a Z-axis limitation built into them, to my knowlege.<P>So to sum it all up in case you skipped to the last paragraph:  <P>Wizards have Z-axis problems with the rain and snare spells.
