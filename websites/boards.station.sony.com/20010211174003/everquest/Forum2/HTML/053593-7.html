</FONT><HR>What exactly is the vision for monks?<P>I always though the vision for monks was a warrior type who used diffrent avenues than the normal one. <P>They made the huge tradeout of no armor for a much better dodging and it cost them the ability to carry anything other than the LIGHT clothing on their back.<P>They traded away defense in a MUCH lower amount of health for a much higher offense.<P>I think monks would be happy if ther offensive advantage equaled the defensive disadvantage they have .I think their extra skill set is properly balanced by their very low weight tolerance.<P>I think that the only thing monks need is a increase in dammage . They need to be rebalanced against kunark weapons. When kunark weapons came out every weapon user got an instant 50% increase in dammage dealt . The monk got left out in the cold unless he also uses weapons and doing so gives him equal dammage to others not the superior dammage he paid for with all the restrictions placed on him.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Is it just me or is Verant now hopefully going to realise how broken and obsolete they made monks by buffing all the other meless way past them in usefulness and power?<P><BR>I remember in the old days. Warriors accepted that monks outdamaged them monks best weapons where 14/30 14/28 14/26 or somthing like that and warriors best were Yaks (7/24+proc?). Any way the point is ..warriors could outtank monks and monks always outdamaged warriors.<P>Now monks barely outdamage a warrior with anything less than the rarest of their weapons and even then by a small margin. Yet warriors tanking was also increased by such a degree it made SKs and Paladins toy tanks compared to them too.<P>Now:<BR>Best equipped monk  &lt;= tanking to avarage warrior<BR>Average monk         = damage to average warrior<P>Balanced:<BR>Best equipped monk    &lt;= tanking to avarage warrior<BR>Best equipped warrior &lt;= damage to avarage monk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There are some changes that would benefit the monk class without unbalancing them.<P>1) Make our quests better. All monks quests seem to be is CAMPING ultra rare spawns. Few examples: ROTLC, Treant fist, headbands, ROTWF. Make the mobs needed for these quest either: A- Spawn much more often in their present state. B- Make the mobs able to spawn in mulitple spots around the zone. The Drolvarg Pawduster in Karnor's should be able to spawn at any spot a drolvarg spawns in the Live Captain OR the Warlord room.<P>2) Our discipline reuse time on 90% of the disciplines is ridiculous. As a 54 monk, the ONLY discipline i even consider using is stonestance, thunderkick is pointless and should be upgraded, whirlwind and voiddance reuse times are much too high for the tiny increment of time they last. Another idea is to discard thunderkick entirely, and make every flying kick at 52 have a 50% chance of landing a thunderkick like the disciple is now. I don't know any monks that actually waste their discipline on thunderkick when they can use stonestance.<P>3) Give us a better selection of weapons and armor. If we HAVE to use weapons to keep up with warrior damage, then how about a wide variety?<BR>Or, make our fists hit faster in the 50's so we don't NEED a weapon till we get our epic. Our armor selection is also VERY limited. Crescent armor is rare and low AC, Shiverback is nearly the same as Crescent, and most other available armors are too heavy or too rare for the average monk to obtain. Tranquil staff is nice, but the weight is 10 and that hurts our AC very badly. One could say that is the penalty for using a good weapon, but i don't see warriors getting penalized for using any weapons.........<P>4) If monks are supposed to be the masters of damage, then why do warriors the same level do the same damage as us or more? An upgrade in overall damage with either weapon or fist use would be nice, as well as a minimum damage for flying kick.<P>5) Feign death is a great skill, but the chance a high level mob will forget you when you fail seems very small. If that mob you feigned from walks into a group of other mobs and you stand up, you get trained. Then you are forced to get a mage to cast call of hero on you or run for the zone with your train. A greater chance to clear aggro on a successful feign would greatly improve this skill.<P>These changes overall would make the class more desirable by groups, and fix several problems in the process.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Man, i just read like all these posts, and i'm scared. I just wanted to comment on the ideas i thought would make a monk good again.<P>First of all, the reason i started a monk, way back in october of '99, was to deal Uber Damage. I was under the impression, at the time, that monks could do ALL their special attacks per battle. IE, Tiger claw, dragon punch, eagle strike, kick, round kick, flying kick, ALL IN ONE BATTLE. when i found out this was not so, i ALMOST quit my monk. Then i realized how unbalanced that would be. However, as i was reading some posts, i saw a post i really agreed with. Some dude commented that monks should be able to make combos. This is like the best suggestion (IMHO) that i have seen yet. Make it so when monks land a flying kick, they have a 50% chance at landing a dragon/tail rake, then 25 for eagle strike, 12 percent for round kick, and it could stop there, or keep going, whatever. Also, thunder kick simply sux. I myself am only level 41, but a lot of 50-60 monk friends continually gripe at the succkage of thunder kick. Perhaps, in addition to that combo, 5% of the time that first flying kick could be a thunder kick.<BR>    Last, i agree that monks should NOT be so equipment based. Why not making a quest that gave us like, "Skill of the Stones," and upped our AC for 30 for the rest of the game? And there could be more quests...something to up our offense too, maybe, and we could have lots, and they could be ungodly hard. Two last things. TREANT FISTS. The second reason i wanted to be a monk  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> that complete heal thing, which was later taken out. Well, i STILL wanted treant fists, and spent 80 hours getting them, was KSed 3 times. i found out that these fists aren't good for anything! I mean, ulthork gloves give same AC, weigh less!!!<BR>***! They aren't even used in the freaking epic quest! I DEFINATELY think these puppies should be upgraded, as they are one of the longest monk quests in the game. Well, thats about all  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alan, <P>First, I'd like to apologize if I am repeating what my fellow brothers and sisters in the Art are mentioning to you, but my gripes with the monk class are few.<P>Please understand that I have a 21 monk, and a 22 druid.  These are my highest characters, so I can not realate to my brothers and sisters who are significantly higher than myself.<P>My first and largest complaint about the monk class is the lack of stun and/or critical attack for the monk class.  Monks are the masters of hand to hand combat.  We have trained all of our lives to perfect this art, even though we know that there is no such thing as perfection.  I also study Tang Soo Do, so I believe that I have apoint of reference when addressing this point.<P>How can the Masters of Martial Arts not be able to stun  an opponent, or land a critical strike?  This is one of the most ludicrous things I have ever heard.  Part of martial arts training is learning the body: its hard spots, its soft spots, where can I strike an opponent to inflict the most possible damage?<P>Now I understand that a possible arguement is that we train and learn on humans.  Quite frankly, it is a valid argument.  Using bare nuckles, am I going to land a critical strike on Lady Vox.  Nope, I won't.  Will I land one on an orc, gnoll or goblin?  I believe so.  They are humaniod creatures, and all of them need to breathe, rite?  I stike a trachia, they are more worried about breathing than about hitting me.  Hence a stun attack.  All humaniod creatures have knee caps, correct?  I attack an opponent and land a strike on their knee, that is a critical attack, or at least a stun, cuz the opponent isn't moving very far.  Please understand that these references are for justifying the addittion of a stun/crit attack for the monk.  I don't expect Verant to give the Monk a Knee Strike ability to cripple the opponent.  It would be nice  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">, but not an expectation.<P>Also, if I read your previous posts correctly, the Monk is to be self sufficient.  Only allowed to carry as much as is necessary for survival.  A couple of stacks of food and water, a lil plat for spending money for ports, etc.  and that's it.  If this is the case, then why are u giving us new toys?  If your vision of the monk is to be self sufficient, then the abilities and skills of the monk should be reflected by his/her seasons of hard work by the abilities that she/he earns;  the seasons of discipline and dedication to our Art.  A true Martial Artist has no desire for worldy possessions.  A true Martial Artists seeks knowledge, and a true Martial Artist know that the true power lies in his/her knowledge.<P>Maybe because I study Martial Arts in RL, I am looking for a stronger correlation to the game.  As to the final decisions, or how you choose to implement these ideas, I leave to you.  I do not pretend to know your game system inside and out, I'm just looking for a fun time in an environment I enjoy, and that being a fantasy world for magic and steel and fists.<P>Overall, I really believe that you folks at SOE and Verant have a good product.  I believe that what most people do not realize is that Norrath is your world, your concept, and it is your version of AD&D, a game that I have loved playing for years.  You folks have brought this big thing to life and it really is amazing when I sit back and try to imagine all the work that goes into EQ. I'm in the IT field, so I believe that I have a slightly better perspective than most as to what it takes to keep Norrath from going 'nova.<P>Thanks for hearing me rant a bit, and thanks to you and your team for kepping Norrath up and running and full of baddies for us to kill!<P>Anacondaur Draganfist of Tarew Marr<BR>or <BR>Ainolas Wyndwalkr of Tarew Marr<BR>or <BR>Joe of Earth  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Firstly, thank you for all your hard work with EQ, it remains a superb game.<P>Okies, the problem... When I took a monk it was on the understanding that I got something special in the damage department. That is what it said on the wrapper. I gave up armour and expected to dodge and dive instead of stand and tank. I took on board a SERIOUS weight restriction that fitted with this ethos. I expected to get hurt when I got hit as I didnt get huge hit points. I took on board a 20% experience penalty because I get special moves. I am a monk, I use my body, I dont want Uber weapons, I dont want superb armour and I dont want awsome quests. I cant carry money so I can't super loot so I can't buy cracking gear. I am 30th level, things should be happening here so that I can compliment a group of adventurers in my guild. It is not. Items wont fix things unless you give then to all and monks, who, by definition, (yours) travel light. Very simply, I want to do more damage with my hand, you can see the code, I cant. Fix it however you can. Please dont dump items into the equasion and also, just as importantly, fix it for those of us who are playing to play. You can check the stats, how many of the monks in game are 50+, few I'll bet. So fix it for the rest of us please or there will be alot less!<P>Just as an aside, your own State Law prohibits you from getting money out of me by telling me my class in your game does the most damage and not delivering. Did you know that? <P>Thank you very much for taking the time to read this. Many of my collegues here have put the essence of this much better than I but I have to say it because I care. As long as we care the game will grow  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> and that is very important.<P>Fredburt<BR>Monk of the 7th Hammer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have some suggestions that are not attack skill related. some things id like to see.<P>increase our cap for safe fall, swimming, mend, disarm and Instill doubt ect to something higher like 225 like others are already. currently at 50 its 200 we monk are supposed to be masters at avoiding damage and dealing damage and mastering our bodies to do more then what others are able to do and this would give us some seperation in abilities from rogues which I currently feel if we didn't have FD we would just be another rogue and FD is the only thing that we as monks really have that give us individuality. <P>the only class that I see might have a problem with this is of course rogue's but they have there own things and some of these suggestions can be crossed over to rogue's also for balancing issues. What id like to see a skill cap 51+ for these to be in the range of 225 or higher. Some information for you from casters realm on current caps i assume which is currently 51+<P>Combat Skills<P>Level 1: 1 Hand Blunt (252)<BR>Level 1: 2 Hand Blunt (252)<BR>Level 1: Bind Wound (210) &lt;-- would like this 225 or higher since we are like ive said supposed to be the masters at martial arts and our bodies.<BR>Level 1: Defense (252)<BR>Level 1: Dodge (230)<BR>Level 1: Dual Wield (252)<BR>Level 1: Hand to Hand (245)<BR>Level 1: Kick (250)<BR>Level 1: Mend (200) &lt;-- would like this 210 or 225 and give it a reason to be that high. like it heals more life then pre 200 number.<BR>Level 1: Offense (252)<BR>Level 1: Throwing (200) &lt;-- don't matter eather way. most of us monks don't really use throwing that much. some do but some don't. I can see a rogue getting this increased more then a monk.<BR>Level 5: Round Kick (225)<BR>Level 10: Tiger Claw (225)<BR>Level 12: Block (225)<BR>Level 15: Double Attack (250)<BR>Level 17: Feign Death (225)<BR>Level 18: Instill Doubt (200) &lt;-- i can see a point from a rogue getting this increased for them also. of course this could be 225 to match the majoraty of other skills.<BR>Level 20: Eagle Strike (225)<BR>Level 25: Dragon Punch (225)<BR>Level 27: Disarm (200) &lt;--would like this higher also. this could be somehting that also happens for all classes that have disarm cap of 200 already. I know SK's have a lower cap then that since they are hybrids and it shouldn't apply to them since that is the case.<BR>Level 30: Flying Kick (225)<BR>Level 35: Riposte (225)<P>General Skills<P>Level 1: Alcohol Tolerance (200) &lt;-- just for giggles. no real reason to raise this except for the fun of it.<BR>Level 3: Safe Fall (200)&lt;-- very important to me. id really want this to have a increase post 50. upto as high as 255 even.<BR>Level 8: Sneak (113) &lt;-- i feel this is fine where it is.<P>These are things that would be nice for monks 50+. What I would also like too see is not just give these to us. make quests for us that we have to do in order for us to get trained in them. Making us go find a grandmaster of sorts to learn above what we now know. Once we do the quest then the skills can advance with use. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My thoughts:<P>Last night I went on a dungeon raid, into a Kunark dungeon.  Because I am lower-level compared to some of the people going, I was not the puller.  My only job in that group was damage.  Guess what? I could have been easily replaced to improve the group with either another warrior or another rogue.<P>For your consideration:<BR>Last night, rogue with epic, monk with epic.<BR>NOTE:  This is theoretical maximums, based on the hardest hits I saw last night with the same buffs.<P>Rogue's POTENTIAL max damage:<BR>Dual-90 hits from Ragebringer<BR>Dual-50 hits from his off-hand (sorry, don't recall name<BR>Dual-509 Backstabs<BR>Total (grouped) damage: 1298.<P>Monk's POTENTIAL max damage:<BR>Quad-60 punches with Celestial Fists<BR>Flying Kick for 149<BR>Total (grouped) damage: 389.<P>It's very rare to see a maximum damage round -- nearly impossible I would say (I, for one, have never hit anywhere near a full-quad for 60).  But when a rogue is grouped, his damage FAR outshines my puny contribution.  Is the rogue broken or imbalanced? Hell no.  He is well-balanced and ready for the challenge of Velious.  Is the monk broken or imbalanced?  Hell yes.  We're still stagnating at the point where we were when Kunark came out.<P>It's a shame I believed my guildmaster when he told me that "One day, your fists will become more powerful than any weapon."<P>Monks need a damage increase.

</FONT><HR>Monk VS Rogue<P>Thus far in the Monk discussions, the main comparisons have been Monks to Warriors and Monks to Rogues. The propensity so far has been to mainly compare Monks to Warriors, from what I have observed, and to point out that a Warrior’s damage output is only ever so slightly less than what a Monk can do, yet Monks are at a gargantuan defensive disadvantage compared to Warriors. All good points, and true that Monks should out-damage Warriors by a large margin due to the defensive penalties paid by Monks and due to the “vision” of Monks as the premier toe-to-toe damage dealers.<P>However, I think really that Monks are far more comparable to Rogues. Let’s have a look:<P>Main Defensive Skills:<P>Monk – 				Rogue –<P>Dodge				Dodge<BR>Block				Parry<BR>Riposte				Riposte<BR>Disarm				Disarm<BR>Instill Doubt			Instill Doubt<BR>Feign Death			Evade<P>This list is virtually identical, with the notable exception of Feign Death and Evade. Now I admit that I have never played a Rogue so you Rogues correct me if I’m wrong here, but I would venture to say that these two skills are somewhat comparable. The difference being that Feign is better in solo situations, and Evade being better in group situations. I do perceive Feign to be the more useful skill, giving Monks a bit of an advantage there. However, I would also point out that Rogues don’t suffer from the weight limitations that Monks do, which I see largely as the Monk’s penalty for receiving the FD skill.<P>Other Useful Skills:<P>Monk – 				Rogue – <P>Bandaging			Bandaging<BR>Safe Fall			Safe Fall<BR>Sneak 				Sneak<BR>Mend				Hide<BR>				Pick Locks<BR>				Pick Pockets<BR>				Sense Traps<BR>				Disarm Traps<BR>				Poison<P>Rogues get more skills here, but Monk’s Mend is a great skill. However, Mend is really mainly applicable if soloing, when grouped you probably have a healer and it’s a mute point. Also note here that the Rogue’s Sneak/Hide combo provides awesome stealth to the Rogues, this helps make up even more ground on the Feign Death skill; and remember that Rogues don’t pay that weight limitation penalty.<P>All in all, I’d say that Monks and Rogues are pretty darn balanced and equal to this point.

How is it that Monks, the class which is supposed to be the premier offensive melee class, put out so much less damage than Rogues?<P>Most people have proposed placing Monk damage output somewhere between that of a Warrior and that of a Rogue, I disagree. Monks and Rogues are highly comparable classes with the exception of damage. Their damage output should be relatively equal.<P>Now I can just see the little wheels turning in VI’s collective mind right now… “Hmmm we should just nerf Rogues.” NOT! Both Rogues and Monks pay gargantuan defensive penalties compared to the “base class”, the Warrior, for the benefit of being highly offensive classes.

</FONT><HR>For the most part im happy and people have some very valied points so i just want to add to the point on armor....<P>Every melee class has many sets of "pride" armor to collect depending on their level. Most all long time monks have no pride in collecting the garbage sets of monk armor out there for us. Why? As its been stated many things offer something better then the junk that comes from the "planes".<P>Throughout a monks career we have sat and number crunched,research web sites for the best possible items for each slot. Why? Are we a bunch of elite power gamers? NO. The reason we do this is because of the monk weight limit. The weight limit has backed us into a corner of number crunching for the best possible item for the given slot.<P>That said please take a look at the AC of some of these sets and increase them to what we are already wearing or bump them up some. Azure sleeves ac 12 and Tranix Crown ac 13 nothing from the planes comes close in AC and these 2 items have a great weight. I believe the PoG headband has a pathetic ac 8. <P>We monks realize we arent supposed to have items with AC like other melee classes but bring the armor sets up to par with what we are already wearing please. If not consider adding HP and better resists to the existing sets. As a final note change the looks of some of this stuff, the graphic designer for the monk gear has got to go. 8o)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi Absor....let's see, what do I think should be changed with monks?<P>Well, first I'd like to talk about what I believe that Verant has in mind for the monk class:<P>We are to be the 'light tanks with nuclear damage'.  Our weapons are some of the best in the game, and monks should be able to out-damage every other melee class.  Monks should be the masters of bandaging, not throwing.  Strong weight restrictions and limited AC gear means that we don't last long when the dragon is hitting us for 225s.  <P>So, what do you do to balance the monk class?<P>1) Minimum damage for ALL monk offensive skills after Tiger Claw.  I know Verant doesn't want to give us the rogue minimum damage of their level, but how about 1/2 our level?  I would be happy to flying kick for 26 minimum.  <P>2) Revise bandaging?   I know you don't think of bandaging as a 'trade skill', but could you tie it in with tailoring (players can already make bandages) so that we get bandaids that do something besides heal?  Such as combining a bandage with a ball of ice from Velious for an Icy Bandage, which heals less and raises CR a few points?  &lt;shrug&gt; We're the masters of bandaging, now make bandaging worth being the master of for us..   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>3)  I don't have a problem with my inability to take a hit.  Group with clerics, and you'll feel like a warrior, I always say...I know monks are supposed to be offensive, so don't mess around with our defensive skills too much.  <P>4)  There's really no way you can make monks the masters of melee damage again, because you can't take the rogue/warrior weapons away from them.  You can't give us anything better than those Celestial Fists, and if you did they'd be too rare to be worth anything.  Every high level warrior has a Wurmslayer/Lamentation.  Now you can talk about damage tests, but we aren't the masters we were.  Hah, if you made it to where we never missed another hit, we probably still would just barely pass the rogues.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  <P>Thunder Kick IS a joke, btw.  8 minutes or not, I could save the cleric some mana by using stone stance instead.  If you want that discipline used for reasons other than dueling newbies, then make it last longer.  5 kicks, 10 kicks?  Warriors get that crippling blow/crit thing, and it lasts more than one hit.  Have you seen them use that with enchanter haste?  It's insane with a high dmg weapon.  <P>Overall, I'm happy with being a monk, even if I feel completely useless sometimes.  Rogues brag about 220 backstabs, Warriors talk about their 4000hp, and I talk about how I got so lucky that one time that feign worked, that I had to wait 30 minutes to mend back up to full so I could try to get away.&lt;shrug&gt;<P>Please help our class out a little.  I know that you don't want to do sweeping changes, but at least throw us a bone with minimum damage skills and a thunder kick upgrade.<P><BR>Merrik Stormhawk<BR>Level 52 Disciple of Quellious<BR>Lanys T'vyl<P>**The tree with the deepest roots, can survive any storm**</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>  Please pardon me for posting twice, but I've just read over two pages of posts, and I've got monks on my mind.<BR>  First off, I'm assuming that my understanding of the monk class is correct:  that we are lightly armored, and capable of doing extreme damage, preferably with our fists and feet.<BR>  Having said that, our class has been seriously messed up.  I've only played for a year, so I don't know what things were like pre-Kunark, but the post Kunark monk world bears VERY LITTLE resemblance to the concept of a monk introduced in the manual.  You people have (presuming that things were different at some point) SERIOUSLY messed things up.  By making our skill caps virtually the same as warriors, by giving the meele classes better weapons, and my making us relaible on high-end, expensive, rare weapons, you have ERASED much of the differences between monks and warriors.<BR>  Do I know what the correction should be?  No, I'm not a programmer.  Should I have to come up with a correction?  No, I didn't mess things up in the first place.  Can this be corrected?  I dunno, you've dug yourselves quite a hole, here.  The quick fix would be to introduce some more weapons, and while that might fix the immediate problem, you'd just be compromising the monk concept again.  Do I honestly expect this issue to be addressed correctly, and dealt with?  Unfortunately, no:  this is supposed to be 'final balancing,' not 'major corrections' and you yourself have stated something to the effect that you don't know much about monks and are relying upon us to educate you.  Nah, I don't think we're going to be taken seriously, here.  I don't see us getting a fair shake.<BR>  As a lvl 30, I can't comment on the usefulness of thunderkick or feign death at higher lvls.  But I definitely encourage you to take the post from Monkly-Business seriously, as it speaks for much of the monk community.<BR>  Thanks again.<P>Oust Ralia<P>P.S.  Sometimes when I join a group, I ask "What classes are you guys?" 'cause I can't tell a mage from a wizard.  But I always know who the monks are, because we ALL LOOK THE SAME!  That's not right, either.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There are a lot of useful posts here, and some not so useful, but most of them seem to focus on two things.  The first is increased damage output, and the second is some method of staying in the combat longer (More HPs, better AC, etc.)  <P>There should be no doubt that monks were intended to do the most toe-to-toe melee damage of any class.  In the first release of EQ, monks dual wield, and I believe even their double attack, capped much higher than any other class, which gave us more strikes per combat cycle, thus more damage.  Our dual wield skill is also provided starting at level one, and advances to a maximum of (Level+1) *7, which again increases the number of strikes that we get, even when compared at lower levels.  With the release of Kunark, other classes were given improvements to these abilities, but monks were not, because our dual wield was already capped at 252.  Warriors grew closer in damage output to monks, but according to tests done by Abashi, monks were still better at causing damage, even with the weapons that Kunark introduced.  With the advent of Velious, weapons have become more powerful, and the results of Abashi’s previous tests no longer apply.<P>Why should Monks do more damage than warriors?  Because we are strapped with plenty of restrictions in order to be able to have that ability.  We have a fourteen-pound weight limit that not only dictates our choice of equipment, but also lessens the amount of loot that we can carry.  We require more time to level up, because we are making more banking runs, and having to save longer to buy better armor and weapons.  Finally, we wear lighter armor, giving up between 33% to 75% of the AC that comparable warrior AC items provide.  <P>What I propose should be done to restore the damage is to give monks an innate modifier to their damage, by fist or weapon.  As a suggestion, add one point to our BASE damage at level fifty-one, and an additional point for every two levels thereafter.  At fifty-ninth level, a monk would have a total of five points of additional base damage, so a weapon like the Cane of the Tranquil would be a 16/25 base weapon instead of an 11/25.  <P>This change would be neither over powering nor out of character for what one would expect for a monk.  Additional damage would make up for the lost advantage in the number of strikes a monk enjoyed before the release of Kunark.  A hard cap on skills due to a programming oversight shouldn’t cause a class’s growth and progression to stagnate.  In addition, a monk (Martial artist) should be more efficient with a weapon than the hack-and-slash plate wearer.  <P>As for increases to our damage absorbing ability, I think the biggest/most logical improvement would be to increase the skill caps for riposte/dodge/block to 252.  Monks aren’t supposed to allow someone to beat them into hamburger, they are supposed to be quick enough to evade the majority of harm directed at them.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The Only question that I feel necessary to ask is What is a monk? I think the general defintion in the EQ pamphlet was correct but very far from a functioning class in comparison to the image. A monk is one who seeks mastery of his mind in stillness claims his inner power.<BR>A) Monks are aware of the inner 'flame' of all things and yet cannot see at night(through darkness) to any degree.<BR>B) Monks perfect thier bodies, shun the use of weapons. This vision got vastly distorted!! Fists should be heavily increased whether it be dmg, dly or a combination. Monks get outdamaged by rogues and often warriors!<BR>c) Monks were originally created as a class that carried nothing more then what was needed, that their skills defined them, not their loot. I would be happier wearing cured silk if my 'skills' were not so dependednt on stats of loot which just puts yet another class in the face greed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>you guys are so clouted you BELIEVE your damage output is that is warriors? are you stupid or soemthing lol.  HMM CELESTIAL FISTS 9/9 with haste bonuses PLUS flying kick.  HMM WARRIOR EPICS ummm 14/24, with haste about ... 14/18 or something like that.  WAR AVERAGE DAMAGE, about 40.  MONK AVERAGE DAMAGE 30.  UHH is there something wrong here, heh, it takes 2 seconds for the war to swing his wep once (assuming no double attack etc, triple attack barely ever works either eg. not viable for comparison) and uhh monk damage = 30 every second.  not to mention jump kicks every 10 seconds or so .  I dont get how you guys think your so far below rogues either SIMPLY NOT THE CASE, rogues can output diddly jack in melee (it adds up, but not like monk damage) and umm they backstab for like 450-500 average, every 10 seconds.  just for a second we will say that rogues do 40 DPS at like 18 delay ,, in 10 secs assuming all rounds are quads a monk would do 1200 w/out misses (30 dmg x4 attacks x 10 rounds) and a rogue would do about 40 primary, 30 or so offhand ((40x2)+(30x2) *5 (half as many attacks in timeframe) which is *about* 700 damage before you add in misses realistically you miss at least 35-40% of the time, so real calculations are:<BR>monks = 720-780 in 10 secs (or 10 rounds **)<BR>rogues = 420-455 in 10 secs (or 5 rounds **)<BR>now lets add your specials, which are like 100 dly before haste, which is what we will use (even though kick is way faster than backstab from my experiences with my low level characters) kicks do about 100, while backstabs do about 500<BR>so in a minute (misses calculated):<BR>monks 360-390<BR>rogues 1800-1950, actually i am not sure how *double backstabs work, but we will assume this works every round so double damage* <BR>rogues x2 = 3600-3900<BR>ok now we will find fighting damage in a minute (prev value x 6)<BR>monks = 4320-4680<BR>rogues = 2520-2730<BR>so what is min and max damage each class can do in a minute?<BR>monk = 4680-5070<BR>rogue = 6120-6630<BR>these are pretty much exactly the numbers i expected to get out of this.  How much of a margin is this folks?<BR>  about 24% margin, meaning monks do 75% as much damage as a rogue, is this reasonable, my answer is YES.  There are a few things that must go into reasonable consideration with these numbers too, mainly is the fact that these are absolutely ideal conditions (ex mob never moves, / turns around and attacks rogue, and mob has approx 0 ac (which they never do heh, so the damage is really 33% less than that at least i am guessing).  You also have to consider the fact that monks ac is WAY higher than rogues, iksars often have 1100 ac at 60 esp after buffs, dunno bout rogues, but from what i here, its way wimpier than that.<BR>ALSO ? can you backstab dragons?, especially when blinded or something.  Exactly my point, a monk ia VERY VERY VIABLE DAMAGE SOURCE against dragons, and im willing to wager taht there tranquil staff is a sort of damage prevention on non dragon mobs that easily balances out everything heh.  Feign death is also a TOOL... contrary to belief.  So before you go on saying man, we do jack for damage, think twice, yes i realize that not everyone has uber equip and is level 60.  Just remember the same goes for rogues also...<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Most people here are posting about very high end or semi high monks. One major change i see that is needed is at my level of 16. I have mainly cured silk, its all i can wear, nothing else fits into my weight limit. Fists are pointless against warriors weapons. My current view on things is that you have monks at lower levels geared to the majority who are super twinked. I swore not to twink but after i couldnt get into a group cause a pally was outdamaging me i got a lvl 60 friend to gimme some more fine silk and traq cane. What non twinked monks need at low lvls are a quest, maybe lvl 5 to 10 for a light 1h and 2h blunt weapon that can compete with warriors. Or, gloves like the epic that alter our dam/delay of fists so they are usable and let us maintain h2h until then. I hope you consider low lvls a little in this post too.<P><BR>Spekter, 16monk<BR>Boogg, 6warrior-bertox</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Pure_Evil, <P>If you're going to post, at least know the subject matter. Saying that monks are balanced because of CF's is ridiculous.  Most monks don't even have CF's, and if they did, a single weapon shouldn't be considered the "Balancing" factor for that class.<P>From REAL parsed logs, not made up numbers, the figures have shown that after a rogue gets double backstab, his damage is 75% higher than monks, not 24%, meaning we do -&gt; 57% &lt;- of the rogues damage, and that was with both classes having their Epics.  <P>You also assume that monks attack much faster than rogues or warriors, for what reason I don't know.  The fact is that there are a lot of rogue weapons that are low delay, and there are new warrior/rogue weapons that have excellent ratios (Willsapper 13/20).  To compare Epics, WITH full haste, a monks is 9/9, a rogue is 15/14, and (assuming your figure is correct) a warrior is 14/14.  Damage-wise, the monk Epic ISN'T their best off hand weapon, warriors Epics ARENT their best weapon for EITHER hand, and a rogue has weapons with better damage ratios than their Epic.  A fully hasted warrior or rogue using a Willsapper would be at 13/11, which makes the CF's look fairly stupid doesn't it?<P>This statement I rather liked too: <P>"while backstabs do about 500 so in a minute (misses calculated)"<P>I have seen rogues double BS for a total of almost 750 damage so I don't think that 500 a minute is at all accurate.<P>"You also have to consider the fact that monks ac is WAY higher than rogues"<P>Evade means that it doesn't matter what their AC is, they won't be hit for very long.  In case you are interested though, I have heard of Rogues with over 1K AC.<P>"Can you backstab dragons?" <P>In a word, YES!  I have seen an 1100 point backstab on Trak.  Sounds like it hurts plenty to me.<P>Basically what I'm saying is don't muddy the water with supposition and created "Facts".  Absor is looking for real data from people that play the classes in question so he can make an informed decision. <P>(By the way, I left out info about the warrior results from logging, but in multiple logs from unrelated people, monks and warriors were a dead heat, with warriors sometimes even coming out on top!) *Gasp, say it ain't so.*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

This takes care of the timing issue ive had when only trying to 2 corpses.<P>Granted, I agree with you on the command you state but the origianal intention of /corpse wasn't to drag a corpse across a zone and was just a unintended benaficial side effect.
