</FONT><HR>Most of these ideas aren't summons, but hey, how can you blame me  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>-----------------------------------<P>An item that is NORENT, LORE, weighs 10 pounds, and has one charge of Bind Affinity.  However, just like melee binding works now, you would only be able to use this item in a place that a melee class could normally bind.  The spell would be called Summon: Bind Stone, and would cost 300 mana to cast, with a casting time of say 6 seconds, and a recast time of something around 10 seconds.<P>Example:<P>Teramenor, a level 49 mage, casts Summon: Bind Stone, and produces a Stone of Binding.  He gives it to Thargor the barbarian warrior.  They are standing outside, in the Frontier Mountains.  Thargor right-clicks the stone, and he is NOT BOUND because he is not in a city zone.  (The charge is used up and the stone is now useless.)  Teramenor curses Thargor for wasting his mana, and summons another stone.  This time Thargor runs to the Firiona Vie docks, and right-clicks the stone.  It binds him to the point he is standing on.<P>This helps reduce the "it's 3am and I can't get a bind" problem, as well as giving mages a new summon.<P>-------------------------------<P>(This isn't strictly speaking a "new summon" we'd get, but it would be a nice modification.)<P>Dimensional Pockets and Dimensional Holes (and in fact, all of our summoned weightless bags) should not be *deleted* when we log out.  They should instead be converted to a heavy, NON-weightless, NODROP, non-NORENT bag of the same holding size.  Let's say 1/2 pound of weight per slot in the bag, so a Dimensional Pocket (4 slots) would weigh 2 pounds (PLUS the weight of the contents of the bag!), and a Hole would weigh 3 pounds.<P>This solves the linkdeath problem; you don't lose the stuff in the bag, but now it's weighing you down.<P>The "unbalancing" downside to this is that you can now go to a newbie area and summon 50 bags, give them to all the newbies, and now the noobs basically have all gotten free containers to hold stuff with.  Yeah, I know this isn't major, but it's still worth considering as a factor in changing dimensional bags this way.<P>-------------------------------<P>Some UI commands and key combinations that would help mages (and necros and enchanters and shamen and...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">).<P>You know how %t inserts the name of the target?  Something like %p (or any %-letter combo hasn't been used) that inserts the name of our pet.  This way, I can make custom emotes that do things like:<P>/em tells %p to kill %t.<P>This way, if I have a bixie targeted, and my pet's name is Jobaner, people nearby see:<P>"Teramenor tells Jobaner to kill a bixie."<P>This is obviously in the "fun" category but it would certainly be nice.<P>-------------------------------<P>Something that would make our lives easier when enchanters are mezzing things would be a command like "/pet sleep", which would make our pet *ignore* being attacked, or when we get attacked.  i.e. no matter what happened, the pet would not add anything to its own hatelist, nor would it attack or fight anything.<P>This obviously might make dealing with enchanter situations TOO easy, so it's understandable why you might not want to do it.  On second thought, even I think this would make things too easy, but at least the idea's out there in case Verant thinks it's a good plan.<P>-------------------------------<P>PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE give us Voice Graft, BUT ONLY FOR OUR PETS!!!  I would give anything to be able to have Jobaner speak!  Imagine the humor!  Such a voice graft doesn't even need to be able to interface with NPCs; anything Jobaner says can be ignored by the game.<P>-------------------------------<P>That's all for now.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>- Teramenor</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>   Good summons are actually one of the hardest things to design for mages, IMO.  It's tough to strike a balance between being good, but not overwhelming.  I'm also not that keen on summoning things just to cast spells on them.  (Storing the spell, as with waterstones, is fine.  Just an awkward way to cast, as with See Invis on a staff, is fairly pointless.) That said:<P>   Bags that survive random linkdeath.  I've had these spurned even for containing summoned items, just because they were feared and hated so!<P>   A low-level 1hb.  <P>   In fact, I'd revise the existing three summoned staves, which just aren't useful as is, even with the added spells, something along these lines:<P>Level 8: Staff of Tracing.  <BR>Currently 2hb, 7.5lb, 7/40, 2 charges of Flare.  New Rod of Tracing: 1hb, 6/32 (one point better than a Cracked Staff off any newbie monster), 5 charges of Locate Corpse (so there's something worth "tracing" with it).<P>Level 16: Staff of Warding (2hb, 8/38, 5 charges of glimpse)<BR>New: 2hb, 9/36 (like Runed Totem Staff, once reasonable loot at this level, now trash even newbies won't touch), proc Ward Undead.<P>Level 24: Staff of Runes (2hb, 9/36, 1 charge of Cancel Magic)  <BR>New: Rod of Runes, 1hb, 5/28 (same as most mid-level loot 1hb staves), give it about 4 charges of Cancel.<P>Level 34: Staff of Symbols (2hb, 10/34, 4 charges of See Invis)<BR>New: Not too bad, as an awkward way to cast See Invis.  At this level, you're not holding weapons anyway.  Make it 6 charges, just so you can do let the whole party see your air pet before destroying the staff.<P>Level 44: Mod Rod (1hb, 8/26, 1 charge of modulation)  Good for groups with a cleric, useless solo.<P>A level 8 1hs sword (consult a melee class for stats  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">, average combat stats, but able to hit magic weapons.  It'd be useful at that level (for non-twinks, anyway).  Five levels later, everyone's got magic or combine anyway.<P>High-level 1hs and piercers that melee classes might actually like to hold.<P>   Lower the level of the Kunark "fun" spells.<BR>Gift of Xev (ration kit, or the "Happy Meal" as we used to call it) should be about level 29, not 51.  (You can already summon the food and bags by 20.)  Bristlebane's Bundle (beer and cake) about 34.  Quiver of Marr, 39.  Bandoleer of Luclin (3 stacks of knives), 39.  Pouch of Quellious (shurikens, which might themselves be tweaked a bit), 49.<BR> <BR>   Lower the level of Ring of Flight (2 charges levitate, level 39).  This is about 20-25 levels past the time all other casters get lev.  Originally, as I understand it, it was supposed to be an always-on item, which might justify level 39.  As it's just a roundabout way to cast lev, knock it back down to about level 24.<P>   Make the Shard of the Core tradable.  As a nodrop, it's fairly pointless.  Tradable, it'd only be a mostly-pointless buff.  Allow it to be used in range and ammo slots -- typically the only slots you have any chance of beating out the phat lewts people already have occupying the thing.<P>   Remove the in-zone restriction on CotH.  The melees will like it better if they don't have to run back to the dungeon.  The in-group restriction keeps it from being a teleport.<P>--<BR>   New things:<P>  I'd like to be able to summon all sorts of food, ideally by choice.  A zillion spells would clutter up the book; maybe some sort of popup menu so I can summon meat pies or fish fillets or whatever?<P>   The ATM Machine: summon from the bank.  An item with a right-click effect that basically lets you access your bank, just as though you had clicked on a banker.  Say level 39.  Level 60, an item that when equipped lets you act like a banker, so all your group can bank.  Now that, they'll love you for  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Throw in the "merchant stone" so they can sell loot before banking while in the dungeon, and mages become group gods  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>   Spell storage crystal: hold it on the cursor, cast a spell, that spell gets sucked into the crystal and becomes a charge on it, to be cast later by the holder at will.  (One charge only).  Might need to be LORE for balance.  Sort of like a general-purpose waterstone.  Say level 39.<P>   Summoned armor.  Again, I don't really want one spell for each piece and type of armor cluttering up the spell book.  Maybe we can reuse that popup window technology.  More likely, just make it an AC buff castable on others.  I'd suggest just making the Phantom Armor line not self only, and stackable with other buffs.  Plus, stop calling it "phantom" armor -- because it's theoretically conjured, not an illusion.  And just for the sake of coolness, combine it with a character graphic of the appropriate type of armor, so the wearer looks like they're in leather/chain/plate.<P>   Money changing.  Maybe a weightless money purse.  Or, a spell that changes money.  Summon Platinum produces 1 pp, requires 10 gp as a reagent.  (Scale it by the money present!)  About level 24, because you're not going to need it once you get the ATM Machine spell.<P>   A summon-by-name spell, sort of a reverse teleport.  Probably requires a confirmation dialog, if not /consent, to avoid annoying players.  Bring anyone to your location from anywhere in the world.  Upgrade to CotH, which doesn't leave us much of a level range.<P>   A quick-cast uninterruptable travel/escape pet.  It's simply not practical to have a pet up while you travel due to bad pathing.  It's not practical to summon one every time you zone without carrying around three thousand malachite.  (What other class has to have a reagent to zone?)  Fix the decoy pet, and make it available at lower levels with about a 2 second cast time.  It aggros on the pets onto itself, and lets you run away.  Give it enough hitpoints for the mage to have a decent head start.<P>   I'm also trying to avoid making up summons to try to solve mage problems in general, so I'll leave it at this, and go think about it some more.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1) Summon Mana Rock.  No drop.  Right click the effect and your pet just got whacked for 300HP while you converted that magical energy into 50 mana.  <P>~or~<P>2) Summon Helm of Meditation.  No drop.  Zero AC  and no stats.  Effect: Meditation.  When worn, allows user to absorb 5 or 7 or 10 or whatever number more mana per tick while meditating.  Or allows wearer to regain mana at meditation rate while standing.  Level 39 spell or something.<P>3) Upgrade "Summon Arrows" spell (or impliment another) to summon arrows with 100 range or more. I would much rather summon 1dmg 100range arrows than 3dmg 50range arrows.  As some of my other characters, I would not use the current mage summoned arrows unless I was out.  50 range arrows only ensure you get one shot off before you are in melee range.  Make the spell a benefit to archers, not a last resort ditch v/s merchant run.  <P>4) Summon Staff of the Elements: 1h blunt with crappy stats like all the rest of our summons, but with the right-clickable effect: Renew Elements, 5 charges.

Currently it uses cats eye agate, and with each phantom spell upgrade it requires an additional agate, currently I'm using 3 agates per cast.  I would much prefer using a more costly gem per spell if it meant I only used one gem per cast.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My Wish-List (may not be balanced, but don't hink it is totally out of the question...)<P><BR>1) How about an anti-summon spell ....<BR>Effect: Percentage chance to cancel anyone summon against the character by a summoning mob....  (sort of like the death intervention spells ..  somebody tries to summon the character, the spell ends and has a chance (should be reasonably high) of blocking the summons<P>2) They should be able to summon at least a weapon of each type for each class.  Myabe not the best but something to give a buddy to practice a new weapon type with or so...<P>3)  Summon Rabbit :-)<P>4) Summon Flowers :-)<P>5) 'Call of the wanted'  Basically the Mobs ability to summon players.  IF the Mage has the mob targeted the spell attempts to pull the mob to the mage....  (usefull for those gating mobs) needless to say it should be a very very high taunt to the mage, but useful<P>6) How about at high levels (perhaps even with regents) the ability to summon rentable items.. (along the lines of food,water, bandages, etc....  if need be balance it out with the cost of the reagents (although I would prefer to see only one regeant for the line), this way the mage could provide for a party what they need and not have to worry about going LD...  THe cost of bandages at high level is nothing, but the pain of running to the store is a pain...  If the mage could summon rentable bandages (even if they cost the same or more) this would get a lot of use.<P>7) (may be overpowered) Summon GM  :-) for all those times you need a GM and none are on this would page them at home :-)<P>PS just for those of you humor dead, the only ones I really care about are # 1,2,5, & 6 ..

It would have a fixed duration of 8 hours (regardless of LD) and can only be seen by its owner.<P>Summon Robe of Elemental Protection:  Summons a robe with a modest AC and good resists to cold and fire.<P>Summon Elemental Totem:  This would summon a totem that would infer fire/cold resistance to anyone near it (say 20 feet).

A modulating rod that costs more mana then you get back, has one charge, and takes life is kinda lame.  Give this thing 1 more charge after level 52 or so.<P>Gift of xev rocks:  give it 100 bandages total and it would be REALY useful.  Also, make it a package deal and add a coldstone to this bundle.  If i could summon food, water, bandages, and a coldstone in one go, i'd be the happiest cat in norath.  This is not a spell cast under presure, it's a utilitarian spell that is there to save us a little time when we are starting out our day.  Make it truely utilitarian.<P>Give us better summoned arrows every 10 levels or so, add 50 range to them and people will actualy want to use them.  As is, they kinda blow.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think the reason you don't see a ton of ideas here is that most Magician's are more interested in seeing fixes or improvements to the things we already have.  I don't want a staff with Clarity charges or Teleport charges (Ok, I lied, I really do but know you won't give them to me  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ). <P>To me fixing the atrocious pathing in some zones, addressing the problems with our post 50 fire pets, finding out why Vocerate Water is by far the rarest level 54 spell drop in the game and providing a meaningful pet healing spell for the post 50 world are far more important issues than giving me new toys to play with. That said, everybody loves new toys so here are the things I would like that aren't outrageous.<P>Pet weapons that are useful<P>Summoned Armor for CR's<P>Bags that don't poof on LD - Hell, make it only 50% weight reduction and it would still be more useful than our current bags in many situations.<P>Summon corpse - Had to ask, sorry my Necro brothers.<P>Gatestone - Lore, No Drop, No Rent, 15 second cast time, uninterruptable.  <P>Summon Pet - I can summon a group member but not my own pet. Seems odd especially since my group members are usually smart enough to find me whereas my pet often is not.<P>Rod of Recall - No Drop, Lore, No Rent, 1 Charge Rod that allows you to suck your pet back into your mana pool regardless of where he is in the zone.  <P>I am sure there are others but it is time ot head to Norrath and leave the rest of the ideas to my Magician brethren.<P>Thanks for asking Absor.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
