</FONT><HR>  I play a warrior and love the class. Only have a few suggestions:<BR>          -Make Taunt better/more effective at the high end game<BR>          -Remove or move up the ac softcap<BR>          -Increase warrior hp in the last few levels(this is needed becuse of the way things hit in Velious)<BR>          -Please either increase the reward of the epic quest or increase the drop rates. I don't mind going through hell to get the swords IF they were on par with the high end epics(RageBringer, RezStick, MagePet, SoS) something that actually increases your usefulness on a raid significantly. Do the warrior epics do this? No. They dont even taunt that well and thats our main job. If you are going to give us one of the hardest quests(top 2) please make the reward better.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Regarding balance vs hybrids:<P>I think the problem here is that you keep trying to inch hybrids towards the warrior specialty: tanking.  I believe you are taking the wrong approach.  The problem is that their spellcasting abilities are lacking.  Hybrids are partially casters, they are not full blown warriors with spells thrown in.<P>For example, give the paladin stronger healing spells, perhaps even a useful buff like group Hero.  Would any clerics be upset that they don't have to cast group hero all the time?  I doubt it.  Paladins would appreciate having their spellcasting side be worth something for a change.  Similarly, the SK's I know frequently have full mana.  They have very little to cast that's at all useful.  Give them a couple of the more useful necro spells -- perhaps the entire mana transfer line (which would obviously not be infringing on necro abilities).<P>Stop making hybrids more like warriors and consider making their spellcasting side more worthwhile instead.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, since apparently You aren't really interested in what we have to say, I'll stop posting here now.  You obviously have no interest in improving Warriors at all and have already decided that you will do nothing.  We say taunt is not effective, you say 'half the Warriors don't seem to have a problem with it'.  I'd like to know where you came up with that figure.  Sure, twinked Warriors at pre-50 have no problem, is that how Warriors are supposed to be?  Secondary characters twinked to a good level of effectiveness?  Several SPECIFIC equipment problems WERE mentioned and yet you completely ignored them.  You made no mention of the AE taunt, or any other new ideas.<P>And to say that improving Warriors would cause imbalances in Hybrids is BS, too.  You don't seem to have a problem improving the caster classes that the Hybrids are based on.  Warriors are SUPPOSED to be better tanks than Hybrids.  I have yet to see where I'm any better at tanking than any other Hybrid in the game (No, I haven't hit level 40 yet, so AC and HPs are still extremely close).  I'm actually worse than most Hybrids because they all have spells that will out-taunt me.  I love playing a Warrior, but I have learned that the only time I will actually be needed will be at Uber-MOB raids in my later levels.  I've never been left out of a group because I was a Warrior, but I've even had a Rogue tanking instead of me because they didn't have to heal him as much and he had a better taunt than me.<P>So next time you want to balance 'all' the classes, just skip the dangling Carrot thing and don't bother asking and wasting my time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Slamz,<P>End game Monks and Rogues are much closer to the damage taking ability of a Warrior than any end game Hybrid. In the 1-50 game Hybrids were much closer to the tanking of a Warrior. It's not inching closer, its that they were thrown away, and are still a long way from their original ratios, end game Rogues and Monks, and a huge leap from Warriors. <P>As to making hybrids more specialized at casting. How much int or wis would you suppose a hybrid has? How much mana? You do know that they pay a penalty for casting in that each spell costs more mana than it does when cast by the parent class, right? They can't specialize also. <P>Hybrids are, primarily, fighters.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>All,<P>Travel issue suggestion that makes sense for a warrior.  Each of my ideas involves the need for a shield as well.<P>RETREAT -- for low level warriors.  The warrior can turn this on ONLY IF HE HAS A SHIELD EQUIPPED and get a small burst of speed until his stamina wears out.  During this time, AC is lowered but the ability to outrun the opponent is increased.<P>CHARGE -- High level warrior attack.  I like to think that a warrior should have a great opening attack.  This skill would charge the warrior's stamina as well (as it could be used to run a ways through a zone) but would also serve as a bash with a running start, maybe making this a cross between bash and taunt would work to solve the high level taunt problem.<P>Both of these skills would need a check to succeed if the warrior is hit before he is out of the mob's range.<P>Both these skills would also force the warrior to give up the 2h or offhand weapon so that the skill may be performed ....

</FONT><HR>Well after reading “some” of the posts I saw some things that I feel are not good ideas such as…..<P>Removing Disarm.<BR>Having Taunt changed to an automatic ability.<BR>Berserker as a LoH type ability.<P>Disarm, “I” don’t feel does what it proclaims it will do (in the higher lvl areas) “Disarm” a NPC, but it is a form of taunt.  Maybe instead of removing disarm how about making it a better taunt?  Or possibly allowing it to Disarm magic items and slow the attack speed of the NPC.<P>Taunt, in my opinion, should be a click able ability.  There are times where you want 1 tank to take all the DMG from a given NPC, if it was Automatic that would be “BAD”.<P>The berserker issue I don’t know about, seems fine as it is, I mean all it is, is eye candy.<P>Criticals are just eye candy and most of the time, are lower DMG than a normal swing, but it is kind of cool to see.  I wouldn’t mind seeing a minimum DMG on a Critical/Crippling blow, Backstab has a minimum amount of DMG based off lvl (at least that’s what I have heard, don’t know though never played a rogue).<P>Disciplines – The only Discipline I use is the lvl 55 one, the others are useless for the most part.  The re-use time on the others make them Useless, and what they do is pretty useless as well.  I think one thing that pissed a lot of warriors off was giving “Hybrids” disciplines.  With Kunark all Hybrids got new more useful spells, and skill increases.  The warriors got a much needed skill increase and Disciplines.  With SoV, the warriors got almost nothing, yet “Hybrids” got disciplines and more spells.  That’s balance?<P>I can understand the AC issue with warriors, because after 1100AC anything more doesn’t seem to do much of anything.  Hybrids with the correct gear can hit this mark, it’s not as easy as the warriors can but they still can reach it.  The HP issue people are complaining about is because of the NPC’s in VoS hit for an insane amount of DMG.  But when you are hit for quad 600+’s what is a couple 100 HP going to do? Nadda, so that is not worth messing with.  I think maybe making AC over 1100 have a greater effect on the DMG taken by the warrior/hybrid.  By doing this hybrids will stay where they are inline with the warrior and it would help both types of characters.<P>The Epic, can say from experience because I don’t have it yet, but from the stats it doesn’t seem that effective, but again I don’t have it so really cant say much on it.<P>I guess that’s about it.<P>Kona<BR>Wood Elf Warrior (57)<BR>Morell-Thule<P>Henil<BR>Barbarian Warrior (52)<BR>Veeshan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><P>1) I _do_ think that warriors should be the weapons masters with top skills in all weapons types.  (This does not mean they necessarily do the most damage!) I think of the pure melee types (monks/rogues) Warriors get the worst deal.  the Damage/defense tradeoffs are perhaps right with the monks and rogues, except they both get great special abilities and the warrior gets none.<P>And all are more or less equally needed now.  Monks for pulling, warriors for traditional tank duties (which they can share with the hybrids), and rogues to access several key dungeons.<P>2) As others have said, the disciplines are a little screwy, take a look at them again.<P>3) The warrior epic is notably harder than other tank/melee class epics which does create a problem at the top end of the game.

</FONT><HR>I play a paladin most of the time. I have a Fiery Defender. If I choose to, especially if I have clarity 2, so can use my mana, I can taunt off of almost any warrior, and given the mob lives long enough, I think off any warrior. I think this is as it should be.<P>However, there are times when I am not chosing to be the main tank, but still the warrior cannot taunt off of me. If I back off a sec, turn off attack, and let him build some agro, that usually works. <P>I'm not sure if this is how it should be or not, but in my experience, it is completely the skill of the other people to stay OFF the agro list more than it is the skill of the warrior to stay at the top. Taunt as a skill can be effective at certain times, but usually only when the people you are taunting off of are working with you and know what they are doing. Taunt works amazingly well if timed to hit right after a caster nukes. Wait too long and its nearly useless.<P>As a paladin, I can move myself to the top of the agro list at will. I take a beating for it, but I can do it. I dont use taunt for this, using the taunt skill takes more timing and finess, its spells that move you to the list fast.<P>The few times I have played a warrior (mostly for the old world dragons), I am always dismayed by how little I can do. Warriors just dont have many options. Taunt does NOT work well enough to get something on you when everyone else is not cooperating. Taunt is NOT effective in getting something off a caster that is badly agroed (you need to time it to hit JUST as he gets agroed, not after hes taking hits).<P>As a paladin I have a great deal more control over these situations than a warrior could ever hope to have.<P>Whether this is balenced or not, I could not say. I do know its damn frustrating playing a warrior with so little control over the flow of the battle. On the other hand, its damn frustrating playing a paladin knowing I am not allowed to try to tank certain mobs, as that is the one thing paladins have always tried to do, to tank, not to do damage. Without defensive, hits for 500+ just are not survivable.<P>I for one would rather play a paladin, as warriors, as they now stand, are just to damn boring and dependant. Perhaps that is how it should be.<P>-Iustus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Really just covering the points made by all the others, taunt needs to be made better if it is to be worthwhile, disarm has little or no effect when it is successful, against the general flow of argument a warriors hp/ac could be upped a little without seriously unbalencing the hp of other classes, especially when considering mobs like Venril Sathir, i mean does it matter a lot if warriors have an extra few hundred hp than a rogue when you are fighting against something that procs a 1500 pt direct dmg?   NO! <P>so what is the point then?<P>Oh yeah and the 2hs policy is a j/k, i mean you are an Ry'Gorr orc.....do you notice the ranger draw two lines of blood with his claws and sabre or do you notice the fact that a 10' ogre has just removed a portion of your anatomy with a large axe? Think about it.<P>Oh and last point, a critical hit should make some difference to a fight, if you land a kick that does twice the standard dmg then whats the point?  Disable kick/slam crits PLZ!<P>P.S blues slaughter us, i am against soloing in general but i dont want to need a healer with me every time i walk through a zone with something nastier than the average denizen of the greater faydark.<P>Thankyou for your efforts, Thrug, ogre warrior, Cazic Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Yes, I agree taunt needs to be looked at.  I have Typhoon and I taunt better using lamentations.  Something is wrong with that picture.<P>Epic:<BR>I love the fact we have to kill badass mobs to get the epic.  It fits the name "epic".  However making the quest pieces rare is absurd.  I am under the impression that this is a role playing game and it seems in a true role playing environment you should have to kill the appropriate mob once to get the item.  Look at the other royals in Chardok- they drop their epic stuff every time AND they are easier to kill.  Not to mention the Spiroc Lord and Maestro.  Sheesh, to me it looks like Maestro has two hands every time he is alive- how else would he play that organ.  So when he dies he should have a hand as part of his corpse every time.  <P>Also, if you plan to keep the rarity of the epic drops as they are now at least add haste or reduce the delay so the weapon can taunt.  Make it worth our effort.<P>Thanks for your time and I really hope you give these two items serious consideration.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I understand the need at the highest level but it's gotten ridiculous seeing lvl 4 warriors looking for crafted armor and lvl 7 warriors wearing cobalt and wielding things like a jagged blade of war or a Wurmslayer. I understand when you get a char. to a high level it becomes your right to "twink" characters if you want but maybe there need to put lvl limitations on using certain equipment. It is a bit unbalancing because these people are so twinked out they can easily solo yellows and reds or can step up a group and make it possible to fight where you shouldn't be able to yet. I guess I'm just a purist and although I think some amount of twinking is ok I think it's gotten out of control.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am wondering if poor Absor has made it this far down...<P>Hopefully you will here me out.  My suggest for balancing within the warrior devisions themselves is to give higher taunts to the little people.  If given the choice, what would you rather have in your group?  A gnome/halfling warrior or a troll/ogre warrior of the same level in the same armour.  I beleive most people would go for the troll/ogre.  In the spirit of kender and balance, I beleive that the smart little people with their smart little mouths  should receive a taunt bonus that marganally gives them a better chance of taunting over their less intelegent, larger classmates.  Considering that iksar  in genral have more issues with armour and the such, I beleive they should get a good taunt just because they are so damn ugly.<P>Grumbler_Mt<BR>Dwarf and damn proud.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have only played a warrior up to lvl8 but have grouped with many. The most outstanding downside I have seen is that they have absolutely no way to attempt an escape of a bad situation or to help the group escape. The AE taunt idea might help this because a warrior could taunt the train to himself buying casters time to evac the group. My idea is more along the lines of a "Blitz" skill. It would work something like this... <P>Warrior hits the Blitz key and for XX seconds any mob that hits him is stunned for a very short duration. This basically allows the warrior to make a break for the zone line and the group to follow behind kinda like a football blocker running in front of the guy with the ball to the goal line. Some variations may be to give the mobs a small chance at a save roll for the stun and possibly if the mob is stunned not add the warrior to his agro. To explain why you wouldn't add the warrior doing this to the mob(s) agro list just picture a mob flat on his back rubbing his head asking "anyone get the license plate on that truck that just hit me?"  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR> <BR>This would also cut down on the size of trains to the zone because the warrior would not be dragging every mob he passes to the zone line which is what currently happens.<P>Bobdobtwo "just call me Bob" Soulsukker<BR>55 Defiler - Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I, personally, like the idea of taunt having a duration for all classes that have it.  Giving taunt a duration (as well as increasing its chances to work) would fix ranger defense problems, monk problems with the warrior damage output, and many other melee problems all in one fell swoop by allowing the tank classes to tank and the damage classes to do damage.  Maybe those Ogre warriors will actually start putting those high AC/HP sheilds to use if they don't HAVE to do the most damage in order to keep a mob on them anymore....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>a_burly_gnoll<P>the 75% offense/defense was not applicable - it was just an example as to how percentages work *IF* they were the same thing.<P>Defense is made up of MANY variables. You say offense and defense are apples and oranges. You are correct.<P>But what I listed in my first post were all elements that contribute to Defense ability *as a whole*.  Hit Points, Defense skill, AC on armor, Dodge, Parry, Riposte all contribute to defense and are all related to one another - they are ALL APPLES - or parts of apples.  Of course my calculations had some assumptions (which I DID say) - for instance - we know that Riposte does not contribute to defence as much as AC on armor, but my first calculation ASSUMED it contributed just as much. <P>Think about this: if I have 75% of the ac of a warrior (the warrior has 133% of my AC), and 75% of their hit points (ASSUMING hit points and AC contribute equally to defense), I do NOT tank 75% as well.  For me to tank 75% as well as a warrior I would have to have 75% of their hit points and 100% of their AC, or vice versa. They are multiplicative.<P>Lets assume 4 melee hits attempt to hit a warrior and a paladin.<BR>Lets be simple and say each 'check' has a 50% chance of working for the warrior.<BR>Warrior:<BR>hit 1: passes AC check, misses warrior entirely (Miss)<BR>hit 2: AC check fails, then dodge check fails, passes parry check, misses warrior entirely(Parried)<BR>hit 3: AC check fails, dodge fails, parry fails, riposte passes, misses warrior and he hits in return(Ripostes)<BR>hit 4: all checks fail, warrior is hit (lets ignore how much he is hit for based on AC for this)<BR>50% chance of AC check passing<BR>IF that fails, 50% chance of dodge<BR>IF that fails, 50% chance to parry<BR>IF that fails, 50% chance to riposte<BR>Now, 50% chance for each is silly, but if these numbers were true - what is the chance the warrior would get hit?<BR>ANS: the warrior would get hit 6.25% of the time.  Figure it out.<BR>Now, I dont' know exactly how the combat system works in EQ - but if things are checked sequentially like that- that is what it would look like. (the percent chance of dodge, parry, riposte - which are really quite low passing percentages - are probably set independently and should be added together in that case - I dont' know though)<P>OK Paladin has 75% of the warrior skills - 75% of 50 is 37.5% chance of the check for each passing: <P>Same as above as warrior, but each skill has only a 37.5% chance of working, instead of 50%.<BR>What is the chance the paladin will get hit?<BR>100-(100* 0.375) = 62.5% chance the paladin would fail the AC check<BR>62.5 - (62.5*0.375) = 62.5 - 23.4 = 39.1% chance the paladin would fail both AC and dodge check.<BR>39.1 - (39.1*0.375) = 39.1 - 14.7 = 24.4% chance the paladin would fail AC, dodge, parry.<BR>24.4 - (24.4*0.375) = 24.4 - 9.15 = 15.25% chance would fail all 4 checks.<BR>Therefore the paladin would get hit 15.25% of the time.<BR>But, the warrior would get hit only 6.25% of the time.<BR>Strange isn't it? The paladin gets HIT more than TWICE the amount the warrior does.  The warrior takes LESS THAN HALF the damage the paladin does.<P>Obviously - if these numbers were true, the paladin under 50% as good at tanking as the warrior.<P>Capiche?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alan mentioned being leery of the 'respect' concept because it was a form of invisibility for warriors (and that he was pushing to remove invis from warrior armor.)<P>So the question is this:  from an "in-game" or from a "gameplay" perspective, what exactly is the meaning of a 'green' monster that aggroes, especially one that gives no exp (at all).  I've always thought that was a strange way to 'make an area harder'.  Regardless of where it occurs, wide ranges of monsters makes the area mostly unplayable for low levels (because unless you have an extremely coordinate party, high reds are difficult to impossible to kill).  It also makes it an annoyance for higher levels as they 'wade through' the green.<P>Both contribute to downtime and high green concentrations seem meant mainly to annoy.

</FONT><HR>One thing I would like to see improve is skill gaining. Since we dont get spells while leveling, would be nice to have some new skills. Or maybe have more skills points than other classes and uncap trade skills (21 trainer cap) like fletching, smithing and brewing for warriors so we can actualy look forward to new stuff when we level. Someone also suggested a skill like AoE taunt, that would be nice. Maybe a skill like a "rage attack" that gives free critical/crippling hit, with a reusable time similar to monk's mend.<P>I don't want to see anything major, just some new stuff to look forward too when we level. You added the disciplines past lvl 50 which are good. But some warriors are not lvl 50. I does seems that anytime a class is "balanced", its always on the lvl 45+ side. Would be nice to get some lvl 20 and 30 changes some time. After level 20, warriors get only 2 new skills and for velious players, 2 disciplines. Not much for 30 level of gameplay.<P>Else of that, warriors are perfect.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I tried to read through all the posts, but unfortunately, I don't have the time. Please forgive me if this is a repeat. I read as much as I could.<P>Item #1 - Increase HP<BR>I don't feel there is a need to increase HP. I have more HP of most the people I group with. If you look at the base numbers for each class, I don't think we have any right to complain.<P><BR>Item #2 - Increase AC<BR>This is a hard subject to approach because AC is relative to your equipment, but that is part of the problem. I am level 53 and have decent equipment for my level. I rarely make the attempt to buy equipment because I feel it is more rewarding to loot it. I am also not guilded so I have limited access to planar armor(i have legs). So I don't have the best stuff but it's pretty good. <P>With that said I'll throw out some numbers. My AC fully buffed last night was 918. A 54 monk(iksar) I was grouped with had 1048 and another monk(56 human) that he knew and was talking to us had 1050. Another monk(47 iksar) with us had almost the exact same AC as myself.<P>Is this a problem? I think so. You stated that a warriors extra HP make up for the fact that hybrids, etc have almost the AC that the warrior has; however, this only applies when a cleric is in the group. With the exception of complete heal, HP do not really increase the effectiveness of a tank given that all the tanks have the same AC. <P>For this discussion, I'll assume that I'm right and offer solutions to what I percieve as a problem.<P>1)Increase the availability of armor. I haven't gotten a chance to camp for the dreaded helm and wrist yet but it took me 2 levels to get my cobalt gauntlets(51 and 52). Crafted armor quests are considerably easier than other armor quests. This gives the warrior the edge they need without taking away the eventual AC for the other classes. After crafted however, we(tanks) are all pretty much on the same level as far as ease of getting armor.<BR>2)Increase natural AC. I do not favor this option. I think that this is a monk area and would not like to step on their toes.<P>AC conclusion: Melee classes are only as good as their equipment(except maybe for monks). If you attempt to remove items and their drop rates from the discussion, you will perhaps overpower the class by mistake.<P>Item #3 - Increase taunt. I don't feel that this is in desperate need of attention as people make it out to be. I can't taunt everything all the time off of everyone, but I don't think I should be able to.<P>This is long so I'll wrap up.<BR>Overall I am happy with my class. If nothing was changed, I would still continue to play it.<P>That's it, thanks for your time.<P>Steddron<BR>53 Champion of Luclin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>i have been playing a warrior since everquest was first released, and from what i have read hear, the only think i disagree with is taunt not working. taunt works just fine, i can almost always taunt the mob. sure a caster will get smacked around alittle with those high aggro spells of theirs, but not for long. <P>the cobalt drops are just ridicuous. all the cobalt i have i either bought from casters (big surprise, thanks for the no drop warrior only armor) or recieved as a gift. <P>epic sword? hahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahaha. <P>attainable by ubers ONLY (along with my BP and legs, even if my guild could kill that, it isnt like the ubers would let us, dragons on the rathe live for about 1 minute)<P>keep making all this stuff harder and harder so the ubers dont get it as easily, and next thing you know, the only people playing this game will be the uber guilds. <P>i can only hope we dont get nerfed. before kunark it was next to impossible to get a group, everyone wanted SK's and pally's. now at least we get groups. dont know if this is the "vision" but we are nothing more than shields. period. we might as well lose the weapons and just hang a porkchop around our necks.<P>i know quite a few warriors on the server, and i can tell you that anymore nerfs and you are going to see ALOT less warriors walking around. <P>Armsmasters......hahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahha........whew, thats a good one</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Warning, possible spoilers below. Skip this post if you care about them.<P>When you say that warriors are the baseline of everything else, are you taking into account self-buffs?<P>Fixing the disparity between 1H and 2H would not radically change our power in relation to the other classes, as one can get the damage output and taunting ability needed already with several 1H combos, such as Wurmslayer/CSS, or Lammy/CSS. The only real change that beefing 2H up a bit would bring is that you'd see more warriors opting to use nice good looking 2H weapons instead of all using the exact same combination of 1H (when they can get them).<P>You said long ago that we'd never, ever get the ability to dual wield 2H weapons, but then you made the Wurmslayer, and effectively let us. The two are not balanced, and someone needs to do some extensive testing to prove it.<P>On item graphics: Please change the Tantor Tusk (50/60 warrior usable piercer) to use a better graphic than the bard mino horn. The animation with it makes no sense, and it just looks stupid. That 23/38ish lance thing would be a nice graphic that would make SENSE.<P>On epic quest difficulty:<P>We need:<P>Rare off Maestro:     3 groups min, pref 4-5.<BR>Rare off Spiroc Lord: 3 groups min, pref 4-5.<BR>Kill Severilous:      4 groups min, pref 6.<BR>Kill Nagafen/Ragefire/Talendor:<BR>                      4 groups min, pref 6+.<BR>Rare off chardok Queen: 5 groups min, pref 6+.<P>Comparison:<P>Rogues:<P>Collection quests can be done with 2 groups or less for the nodrop pieces, can buy the others.<P>Renux can be done with 1 group.<P>General can be done with 3 groups.<P>Rest can be solod.<P>Monk:<P>I believe all fights can be done with 1 group.<P>Cleric:<P>Ragefire is easy, due to him being about as mean as Nagafen minus the 53+ portout.<P>Chardok Overking is easier than the queen, he doesn't have near as many guards, nor does he AE.<P>Ixiblat Fer is not as difficult as a dragon.<P>Cleric in the temple of ro is a wuss.<P><BR>Magician: items can be acquired while doing other epics. Neh'Ashiir can be done with 2 groups.<P><BR>Shaman:  mistmoore fight isn't difficult. Lords in CoM are not dragon scale fights, and can be done with one group each if you are good.<P><BR>Wizard: don't know this one.<P><BR>Bard: drops off 3 named wurms/drakes, 3 groups each, not as rare as dragons. Half the collection fights are easy, kedge isn't too difficult, and there are plenty of amy whips out to multiquest.<BR>Nagafen and Vox are not all that difficult. Trakanon is about equal or easier than Severilous.<P><BR>Enchanter: number of parts can be done solo due to the mob normally being camped. Others can be done with 2-3 groups no problem. Prince of chardok dies on the way to the king. Monkey in FoB is not difficult, other mobs are in the hole, misc ones that die in dozens in PoH, and the one that spawns after Cazic Thule dies. That one is only as rare as Cazic Thule, and is not dependent on drops.<P><BR>Shadow Knights: Most fights need fewer than 3 groups, ones that need more are not as difficult as a dragon. Soul Leeches can be multi'd, and there are a number of them in game already.<P><BR>I'm tired of typing the same stuff repeatedly, but when you get down to it, the main one harder than the warrior one is the necromancer one, and only because you saw fit to require a very rare drop off of Innoruuk, rare enough that there are about 5 on my server since the quests went in, with Inny dying within a day of spawning. Of the epics, the warrior and necro ones are almost a joke. Risk/reward is backwards for the epics: easier the epic, better the reward.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan, I disagree with you asking to take Effect: Invisibility away from Warriors. This effect is only on Cobalt Greaves (i think only them, right?), and im sure you know how rare they are. They are a RARE off of Venril Sathir, and will NEVER become as common.. as say a BIBS has. They will always be very rare to see. A warrior that wins this item SHOULD be able to have the privelige to cast Invisibility on himself. Please think about it..<P>-MR</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, as a monk, I support the idea that warriors should be improved instead of remaining stagnant or nerfed while the hybrids are improved (or maybe even improved in abundance).<P>Still...tis kinda disturbing to see warriors complain about their damage in comparison to the monk and their ac and hp to a monk, and say the monk is nearly equal in the ac and hp department but blow the warrior away in damage.  This may be the case at certain levels: high 30s, the 40s, and low 50s. But...RoK improvements to warriors is seen as the warrior progresses through the 50s. <P>In the low 50s, I saw that my AC was above the warriors, and there was no way he could outdamage me.  But things change quickly.  Those same warriors from the low 50s, skyrocketed past me.<P>At lvl 56 my HP is around 1300 and with all my hp gear (and there's a lot of it...I go all out for AC and HP) I'm at 1700.  My AC is around 1020.  I am also self buffed with Major Shielding and Monk song buffs.  Now, what are warrior stats at this lvl?  The warriors I hang around with have far more than 1300 hp and if they have the hp gear i have, they'll have much more than 1700 hp.  All the warriors I know have more AC than me.  Though I had a good advantage over these warriors in this department at the low 50s, these same warriors flew past me in the next 4 or 5 lvls.  Why?  The warriors defensive skills went up while mines barely changed and then the warriors started getting more planar and cobalt armor.  And to say that cobalt is rare and can't be expected that warriors have them...i just want to say I'm comparing that to my stats where i use rare monk stuff like quest items that cast a song and a staff of shielding which greatly improves my ac and hp.<P>As for damage dealing.  In the low 50s I'd destroy warriors in this department.  Monk songs, awesome weaps, higher skillz...I just blew warriors away.  Five levels later, the warrior gets his sebilis weapons and his skill improves. Now solo, I'll still greatly outdamage him since my haste is better due to song.  But skillz and weapon wise...he's almost right behind me.  In a group...we have same haste if ench is present...and my advantage dwindles greatly.  My advantage becomes the 2 point skill difference and btw, the warriors strength is far greater than mine.<P>So, I'd just like to say, to the warriors not at endgame yet...you guys improve a lot in the 50s...take that into consideration.  <P>As for balance issues, verant peeps, plz take note that you may have to look into balancing end game between these classes, but also look back some levels and balance these classes in their 30s, 40s, etc.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I had this idea last night while thinking over the thread.  I think it could make the warrior class more entertaining to play and more capable of meeting their potential, without unbalancing the game.<BR>There would be a new warrior only trade skill called Armoury, or something along those lines.  It would be a lot like smithing, but using strength as it's primary attribute (it makes a lot more sense for smithing to require brawn over brains anyway).  It would allow warriors to make armor and equipment for themselves out of items that would drop randomly, much as research components drop for intelligence casters.  Purely as an example, the cobalt bracer might involve combining a brick of cobalt ore (an uncommon drop in Kunark zones), a 10 charge shrink potion (assuming shamans can make such a thing... don't know alchemy all too well), a vial of viscious(sp) mana from an enchanter (or similar item), a bracer mold, and perhaps some other items.  They would be combined in special forges kept in warrior guilds across Norrath.  Items meant to be rarer, along the lines of a cobalt breastplate, might require several cobalt blocks, gems, and a not terribly rare drop off of a major mob like Trakanon.  Weapons could be created in a similar way.<BR>There would be several purposes behind the addition of this skill.  First of all, to give warriors a skill they can use outside of combat.  Warriors currently have nothing they can do outside of combat on their own that is not time prohibitive.  Secondly, warriors would be able to create some of the items, both weapons and armor, that define their class, much as intelligence casters must research many of their spells.  Third, warriors would be more capable of actually attaining the equipment they need to be effective in their class's role, instead of it being restricted to warriors who belong to uber guilds or who have other characters that are casters and can afford to buy or camp it.<BR>Other classes would benefit from having more effective warriors in their group, and several classes could benefit by being able to sell warriors trade skill items needed to make their items.  They only people that wouldn't benefit would be those people that currently make an outrageous amount of money camping warrior items they don't need.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have warrior characters on several servers and quite frankly, I like playing a warrior better than any other class I have played thus far (and that is quite a few.)  My one suggestion would be to change the way crits and crippling blows are handled to more like a monks mend.  That way we could use them when neccessary, but not ALL the time.  The gods only know how many times a warrior has prayed for a critical hit when it was really neccessary... only to never have it come and end up running (again) back to there body.  I absolutely hate it when I feel like slamming on some greenie and end up wasting a crit that I REALLY needed somewhere else.  <P>Other than that I agree that warriors are very well balanced... and the downtime for me is well, the only chance I get to eat. =) <P>Just my 2cp. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The one portion of the warrior epic that seems rediculous to me is the blade being an 'uncommon drop' on the Sarnak Queen in Chardok.  As far as I know for the difficulty involved in killing the mob the Sarnak Queen is the only one that takes 3-4 hours to get to with a group of at least 24 and then she may not even drop it.  Compare this to the Ghost of Kindle in the hole, a lower level of effort but always drops.  Keeper of the Tombs, a lower level of effort again, but always drops.<P>The warrior epic is not easy to get, aside from the queen you have to have a force be able to get to the Spiroc Isle in Sky, kill one of the level 60 dragons in Kunark, requires around 10,000pp for items (three gems, 2 rebreathers).<P>Now some may compare this with Cazic Thule not dropping the item for the Wizard epic, we also have this same issue with Maestro of Rancor in hate not always dropping his hand.  However, people are doing the planes all the time and killing these mobs is not very difficult.  <P>The queen in Chardok is very high risk, very low return.  You are required to make a very difficult raid to end up empty handed and plan it again another time or hang out for the queen to respawn again...<P>Just something I think should be looked at...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hey, first off I'd like to say I'm VERY glad the team is looking into things like this, and this very well may be the beginning of me coming BACK to eq. I left because of major problems with the customer service (specifically based on or towards the rallos zek server). Anyways, the ONE THING THAT WARRIORS NEED IS.....<P>a longer melee range. Granted, the PvE (i spent nearly 3 years now, w/o knowing what that E stands for, enemies? i dunno..) specifics are fairly moot. We all hate when it's laggy and a mob manages to run just ahead of you and you can't hit it. it's lame, we all know that. THE MAJOR USE IS...<BR> PvP. <BR> OMG PVP DEAR GOD THAT WORD AGAIN! can't they just leave us alone they have their own server what more could they want!<P> A melee class, ANY melee class, i repeat EVERY CLASS needs this. Everyone pvps melee. i dont care what people think, we do. I quit for a little while and i'm most certain they still do. As a warrior, i was useless. the lag prevented me from engaging enemies. they would just run aroudn in little circles or around the zone, and i couldnt touch them. Solely because of lag. I have offered this opinion MANY times thus far, but never have been acknowledged by a blue name. I really Absor takes another look at this post and sees my input. Thanks everyone, hope you agree. ( I know the blue server warriors dont care, but trust me, next duel or guildwar, you will thank me if it gets changed.)<BR>              The ever loving, never playing, pvp attempting, missing the addiction for nearly half a year warrior,<BR>                Achazael Hammerfall the 54th level Champ<P>p.s.
