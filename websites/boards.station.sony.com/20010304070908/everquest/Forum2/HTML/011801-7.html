</FONT><HR>Wow Tiger, next time you see that Bard tell him he's goooooood.  Our AE damage songs have a VERY small range, so if he can manage to stay just out of melee range and get that song to hit them, he is very skilled.  I'd say the margin of error is like one step forward or back (forward out of range, back in melee range).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Feaglund, yes, of course I went about killing placeholders, it wasn't JUST my group and this bard, there were other groups.  But taking out two hg's at a time all by herself with no downtime really reduced what was available to the rest of us.  Is that ok with you?  <P>And class envy?  What is there in my post that is class envy?  If anything, this entire thread is nothing but one MASSIVE enchanter-envy sit in.  <P>Your post was insulting and inflammatory, my posts have not, sir.  I find it appalling that you would say -I- am the one with class envy here.  If so, please address the same statement to every bard here that says that it's not fair that enchanters have it and they don't.  Which is most of the posts here.<P>Not that I -minded- that, mind you.  I only bring up class envy because YOU did.<P>As for the other bard who just stated that bards are supposed to be part enchanters.... well, 1) I never heard that, where did it say that anywhere? and 2) even if it's true, well, you have charm, you have mana song, I believe you have haste songs... the only thing left of real value that an enchanter could have that you don't would be a powerful mez.  So it does sound to me like, yes, you are part enchanter.  You certainly have most of their truly valued skills.  So mez is the only thing you're lacking, really.   Well, that I can think of, anyway.<P>Qwinn Windfletcher<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I will if I see him again.  I don't know what ranges bards songs are, but I did see him get hit occasionally, however he just kept on trucking.  I do know that the giant races have quite a bit of attack range, so I would have to agree he walked a fine line.   But I wouldn't base my judgement of a class on what 1 person can do.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

WHY are the animations not in, and more importantly, WHEN will the animations be in? Please don't tell me you guys don't have a picture of a drum so you can't add it.  You added 10 or so new animations last year, and you just did 2 expansions.  I know you have a graphical artist SOMEWHERE at VI that can draw a picture of a bard playing a drum.  Over a year ago Brad said on Usenet that bard animations would be fixed with the next art patch, and they weren't.<P>"I've not personally looked at the appearence in game to see."<P>You've never seen a bard with selos on?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I do not think the majority of bards want a song that makes them as effective as an Enchanter; merely a song that WORKS.<P>We've now been informed that:<P>"Lullabye is working as we intended. The song was not meant to work well on mobs over level 30. The upgrade is the Pixie strike, and then again Twilight. However, even the upgrages were never meant to be as effective as the Enchanter's spells."<P>Let me take out the sentence I am having a problem with:<P>"The song was not meant to work well on mobs over level 30."<P>The problem I have with this sentence is this: It is not necessarily mobs over level 30 which are the problem. The resists are absurd on mobs *UNDER* level 30. Hell, the resists are absurd on mobs *UNDER* level 10.<P>Now, if the song was not meant to work well on mobs over level 30, am I to assume that it is NOT MEANT TO WORK NEARLY AT ALL on mobs UNDER level 30?<P>The last time I used Lullaby was sometime between levels 29 and 34; I was using it in Highpass, to try to distract the hordes of orcs (all of which conned "easy green") from over-running a small group of teenagers.<P>I certainly did distract the orcs.  However, rather than the Song Soothing the Savage Beast, all 6 of the Savage Beasts regularly resisted the Lullaby.  All 6 of the "easy green" con Savage Beasts beat the unfortunate bard down to less than a dozen hit points. (I only saw the success message three times amidst the scrolling spam of resist messages before I decided the hell with it and ran to the zone.)  <P>I am, of course, beating a dead horse.  The Powers That Be have decided that the song is working as intended:  The song is intended to get the bard killed as quickly as possible.<P>However, since playing a bard is an exercise in flogging dead horses, if that wasn't the intention of the song, might someone be able to explain WHY there's ANY problem with this song being close to useless against mobs UNDER 30th level?<P>Now we are also told this:<BR>"Bards ... are a class all to their own. If I had to name something, I'd call them part warrior, part rogue, part enchanter, part druid, and part shaman."<P>Mr. Abashi, I disagree with this assessment.  Please do your employers and the users of your product a great favor.  Take some time away from reading through this hell, and create yourself a little bard. Hell, twink yourself to high heaven, it won't make a difference.  And PLAY that bard.  For more than ten minutes.  On a live server.<P>LEARN what a bard CAN and CANNOT do; what skills ARE and ARE not used; what songs WILL or WILL NOT save your group or make you useful.<P>Then you won't ever, ever have to embarass us by asking a question like why we can't twist other songs with our invisibility song, or by making a statement like "Evidently the drum animations aren't in, or perhaps we don't have anything that looks like a drum when held."  <P>Hello! Of COURSE the drum animations aren't in! They haven't been in since I started playing! I've even seen posts which say they'll NEVER be in because no new animations will be added! <P>Are we to infer that you've NEVER SEEN A BARD STRUMMING A FLUTE WHEN THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE HITTING A DRUM? Dear gods, man, have you even *seen* a bard in game?<P>It is patently obvious that you're woefully uninformed; the statement is not meant to be insulting, nor a flame - merely a statement to be taken at face value.  I encourage you to educate yourself on the capabilities of the bardic class.<P>I take umbrage with this remark:<P>"Why are dozens of high level bards quitting over this issue? Dozens of high-level players quit over every issue imaginable. Often I think that in cases like this, the player is burnt out and is looking for a reason to bail out or start a new class."<P>That, Mr. Abashi, is somehow insulting, and were this other than a forum for a bit of entertainment, I'd ask an apology.  I'd wager your thoughts are no where near reality.<P>I'm not a high level player. My highest-level character is a 35th level bard, and I've been playing since a month after the game was released. I'm not burnt out; there are still many zones in the game I've not explored and sights to be seen.  And I'm not looking to start a new class, for I also play a cleric, necromancer, magician, warrior, rogue, and shaman. <P>I believe that people are quitting their bards and cancelling their accounts because they are disgusted with the apparent ignorance and haphazard lack of attention to detail given to the problems with the bardic class.  <P>At least, that's why I am.<P>Lilithiel, 35th Bard, Retired</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Qwinn-<P>Ive agreed with you many a time, but you are way off here.  <P>1.Lullaby does not make our OVERALL POWER too great.  No one ever claimed it did before it was nerfed, except Verant.  There were never any threads that said, "OMG, Bards mez better (or even equal or near equal) than Chanters! Nerf this!"  It was simply one more song among many that bards can perform at a lesser rate than the main class who has the ability.  Now we cant use it at all, because its a death trap.<P>2. Every group i run across takes me for my "crack" and nothing else.  I used to remember a time when i was wanted for snaring or mezzing in the absence of chanter or druid/ranger, now if you cant get a chanter, the group says "Oh okay, we'll have to try to pull singles."  Even they know we cant mez worth a darn.<P>3. Yes there are some bards (a small percentage) that can solo HG's.  Most dont or cant.  Just because a few talented people can do something doesnt mean its doable by all, or easy.  It takes a huge amount of time to solo a HG, and frankly its boring and not worth the effort associated with the risk.  Our songs still resist, and a HG can bash us into eternity rather quickly if the fear/charm/snare songs resist just a few times.<P>4. You said that our mez song DOES work.  Technically true.  But most bards dont use it, because when it DOESNT work (which is a really high percantage of the time) we are simply d -e -a-d.   Pounded into corpse retrieval.  If youve ever seen a mez fail against a mob of three and start bashing the bard, youd know that sometimes we dont even get a chance at healing, the life goes down within 10 seconds.  Clerics have to really keep an eye on us.<P> You kept bringing up the Hill Giant issue.  I have seen almost every class solo a HG at some point in time, yes including a ranger.  Maybe they were good...maybe they were lucky, maybe they were twinked, maybe they were superbuffed, but they did it.  It doesnt mean that everyone can do it.  When, as a class, anyone can perform a certain action with a good chance of suceeding, THEN you can say it is an inherent ability of the class.  Not just because you saw ONE or TWO people do it once.<P>Besides, all we are asking is for something that is important to the class be restored to what it was.

</FONT><HR>Personally, actually, I wouldn't mind at all if you guys got the type of mez spell that Karlee describes (tho, again, don't you guys still have a single-mez song?  Pixie or something?  I generally hear that that one works ok)<P>My only reason for being here is that you guys are whipping yourselves into a freaking frenzy over a nerf that happened months ago.  And the Verant bashing a couple of pages ago was getting ridiculous.  It just seemed to me you guys needed someone different to bash, so I figured I'd take the heat for a while while engaging in a good discussion  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>You've made it clear what you guys -want-.  And sure, it's a good wish.  But you've been told no.  And now you're saying bards will quit in droves.  I really just don't understand that.<P>By the way, you guys said that hg's max out at 37, which is the limit of the song, and that's why it works.  (and by the way, if I recall correctly, the way she was killing 3 hg's as opposed to 2 was by either charming one and getting two uncharmed ones to engage it, or having 2 fight while she AOE ran in circles with another... and yes, she did, by running in circles, seem to stay in range pretty consistently.  Took a couple hits but the hg was taking more).<P>At level 45, I cannot solo one hg.  I am told that I won't be able to at 50 either.<P>You guys aren't giving one thought to balance.  You say it's unfair to portray you based on that one ability, and maybe that's true... but A) most classes NEVER get to have that ability, I would -drool- for just being able to do that one night, you oughta have seen how DELIGHTED I was to find out that I could solo a dog in FV at level 41 at -all-, never mind the downtime.  B)  I simply have never, ever, ever seen someone say we don't want a bard in a group even if the group has an enchanter.  Honest.  C)  Your heal songs rock, take MASSIVE pressure off clerics.  D)  I'd rather have a charmed mob than a mezzed mob any day of the week.  E)  It must be nice to be the fastest thing in the universe.  F)  You say that Verant hasn't done -anything- for bards - wasn't that drop confirmation box put in -specifically- for you guys so that you wouldn't drop stuff accidentally while switching between instruments and weapons?<P>Eh, I have to go home.  See ya guys.  I hope no one's offended cause I participated in the conversation, and quite frankly, you DON'T want to convince everyone that you suck.  I don't think rangers actually make a group less effective, but according to a lot of rangers whining on these boards they do, and now it's tough to find a group.  Don't do the same to yourselves.  Take it from me.<P>Elraent:<P>"Qwinn, play a bard up to level 50, then come back here and tell us how satisfied we should be. Until then go back to the ranger whines."<P>The only other thing I've read here (besides Feaglund's remark earlier) that pissed me off.  A more hypocritical statement, I have -never- heard.  Funny how only your class problems matter, eh?  Bah.  And oh yeah, by the way, seeing how highly desired they are in groups, I -do- think my next character will be a bard.<P><BR> <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Abashi, please answer the one question that bards continue to ask over and over and over and have not gotten an answer for yet.  Why does lullaby from a level 60 bard, not work as well on creatures under 30 from a level 20 bard?  I can "understand" you saying that the song is not intended to work on mobs over level 30.  OUR POINT, is that the songs decreases in effectiveness as you get higher in level.  There is absolutely no reason why my level 54 bard should get 6 straight resists on 6 level 4 and under mobs. You are just plain wrong in your testing that as you get higher in level, the song continues to work as it did when you first got it.  When I first got the song, I had a LOT more success mezzing things than I do now at 54, and I am trying it against the SAME mobs.  <P>People have tested this song over and over, IT IS BROKEN.<P>Face it, at higher levels, the song basically is not effective against any mob, regardless of whether the mob is level 1 or level 30.  <P>Also, don't try t tell us that it is too powerful, when it lasts for about 8 seconds, and you have to use a stringed instrument to play it.  This makes bard have to get rid of their weapons in a fight, and basically do nothing but mez the mobs.  I hardly call 1 player handling crowd control during the entire fight overpowered.  I would understand your logic if you could play the song once and then go back to fighting but you can't.  <P>It's my opinion that no one at Verant knows anything about bards, certainly not the people who tested the song.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Regardless of the balance issues surrounding this particular song, I think this debate has shown how crucial an issue crowd control is. Look at the number of "hot topics" that are directly related:<P>* Feign-death pulling<BR>* Camping-and-pulling instead of dungeon crawling<BR>* Snaring (another bard issue)<BR>* Mesmerising<P>Maybe there's some fundamental problem with mob population density or aggro tendencies at the core of this, but what it all boils down to is this:<P>* A group must find a campsite relatively free of wandering mobs.<BR>* The group must pull a number of mobs not exceeding a certain limit, which depends mainly on the relative strength of the mobs to the party, and the presence or absence of an enchanter in the group. Classes that can FD are good at accomplishing this.<BR>* The group must prevent injured mobs from running away and pulling more mobs back with it. Classes that can snare or root are needed for this.<P>Dubious strategies (such as kiting) aside, the above is the sine qua non of adventuring in EQ. Either you do this successfully or you die. Therefore, your group must consist of a combination that can perform these functions. Once you've got that covered, then you shoot for things such as:<P>* Reducing downtime so that you can pull more often and thereby gain more loot and XP. Bards are famous for this, and many other support classes contribute significantly.<BR>* Increasing the number of mobs you can handle, both for safety's sake and for more loot and XP. Enchanters are the strongest here because of their mes abilities, but all classes, of course, contribute.<P>I think bards are upset because we've recently learned of significant problems with our ability to contribute in two of these key areas: the number of mobs a group can handle (lullaby) and our ability to help prevent runners (chains). We're increasingly dependent on our ability to reduce downtime to provide value to a group. Of course, we can still increase a groups combat effectiveness significantly, but it feels like our overall value has decreased.<P>When asked about "the Vision" for bards, Abashi said, "That's for you to figure out and establish given the tools that we've provided." Personally, the issues with chains and lullaby have forced me to narrow my vision a bit. I used to think of bards as "jacks of all trades" that could compensate somewhat for the absence of a specialist in any key area. I'm seeing bards in a much more limited support role now.<P>Food for thought...thanks for listening.<P>[39 Bard] Mannerism Dirgesinger (Half-Elf) &lt;Intrepid Spirit&gt; SERVER: The Rathe<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>OK Verant, from what I can tell, you have 2 arguments as to why Lullaby isn't broken.<P>1)You say it is a low level spell and low level spells can't be used on high level mobs.<P>2)You say a bard will be able to keep mez going until eternity(unlike an enchanter?) with no risk to himself because it uses no mana.<P><BR>Attempt to refute argument 1)<BR>It just doesn't make sense that when a bard needs this spell the most, is when they can no longer cast it.  At the levels that it does work, a group can actually get away with not having an enchanter.  But at higher levels, when having a mezzer in your group becomes an absolute necessity, it no longer works.  <P>There are no enchanter mez spells that don't work on mobs higher than 30(except at really high levels).  The enchanter AoE mez(a level 16 spell) still works at higher levels just about as good as it does at lower levels(the resists just hurt a lot more).<P>So unless you give the bard a new song to replace this spell(which makes no sense given how songs work), you should make lullaby work as it once did.<P>Attempt to refute argument 2)<BR>As far as a bard being able to mez forever with this spell(as opposed to an enchanter) this isn't true.  In many instances, enchanters can med back all the mana they used to mez in between refreshing it.  And if an enchanter uses the mem blur spells(which the bard mez doesn't do), they may not even have to keep mezzing it; just leave it off in a corner away from the action to get back to later.<P>A bard has to keep the mez going, taking away any of his other group functions while enchanters *can* do other things in between refreshing mez if necessary.  If this isn't a big enough cost to use this spell, I don't know what is.<P>At high levels, mez resists are going to do as much damage to the bard as the enchanter(since there ain't much difference between crappy defense and really crappy defense), but at least the enchanter has a fast casting stun spell, to get thing off him to give him the opportunity to re-mez.  The bard has to wait 3 LONG seconds for the mob to *maybe* get re-mezzed.<P>Even with the bard mez working just as good as the enchanter mez as far as resists go, there will still be a mana limit to how long he can keep the mez going.  the mana being used just won't be the Bard's mana, it will be the healer's mana trying to keep him alive through the mez resists.<P><BR>In summary: Bard's have the ONLY mez spell that has a level cap(just when it is needed the most), and even it was brought back to the way it was, it would not be a manaless spell as the healers would still run out of mana keeping him alive.<P>One more thing.  What up with this huge concern about manaless casting.  All this kunark armor out there has manaless casting by the boat load.  Manaless heals, manaless buffs, manaless DD(better than bard songs!!!).  And all this Kunark armor spells are of the "set it and forget it" variety.  While a bard has to keep playing the damn song over and over again.  Sheesh!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I started a bard because it seemed like a fun and useful grouping class, which it still is albiet in a diminished capacity since our mez and snare songs have been woefully nerfed.  I have actually soloed most of the way from 27 when i got Charm to 47 which is my current level.  Alot of HG's in rathe mountains.  When i fought HG's there i always cleaned massive amounts of trash, i would routinely get 12 HG's on track when i did this, so if you were getting squeezed out on spawns it was because this one bard wasn't doing the work of clearing trash, not because bards "hog spawns" or some such.<P>&gt;&gt;Curious - asking honestly - what level range is &gt;&gt;it that that trick works? And why doesn't it &gt;&gt;work on any other mob in any other location?<BR> <BR>This "trick" works from level 27 to about 45, when level 37 mobs start going green.  It can be done in any area devoid of agro wanderers, Frontier Mountains and Dreadlands are both good for this and I spent a lot of time there charming mobs.  I made my way through level 46 in Emerald Jungle using the higher level charm, and i could get about a half a bubble with a full bar of mana, after which i would have to find a quiet spot to sit for about an hour while i went afk to play Chrono Trigger or read a book or something.<P>The point of all this bardic uproar is that most of us don't want to solo HG's, we want to be a valuable group member who can contribute in more ways than mana and HP regen (forget that most of the time healers immediately heal everyone after a battle so our HP regen songs are useless).<P>&gt;&gt;Just checking, theirs [necros'] works on undead &gt;&gt;only, right?<P>Wrong, Necromancers' spell Screaming Terror is a single target 18 second duration mez, appliable to all mezable mobs.<P>&gt;&gt;I believe you do have a working single mob mez, &gt;&gt;don't you?<P>Again not correct, our single target mez level 28 Pixie Strike is useful but it has the same horrible secondary resist rate as Lullaby.  It is possible to maybe keep two mobs locked down with a flute (the song also debuffs magic resist).  I can accomplish the same with less trouble charming.  The higher level single target mez i don't have yet, but from what i've read it shares the same problems.<P>&gt;&gt;HAHAHAHAAH. You are SO wrong. Bards are now &gt;&gt;defensively FAR SUPERIOR to rangers. <P>Sorry you are wrong again, we got Parry and Riposte at high level (53 and 58 respectively i believe), and they have very low caps (75 i think, our Dodge skill is capped at 120, the same as pure casters).  The only thing making Rangers "poor" tanks is lower ac, up to level 50 your defensive skills cap at the same as paladins and SK's, and either the same or 5 points lower than pure meele classes (can't find a site with exact formulas).  Post level 50 the addition of Disciplines to pure meele's increases their defensive abilities in some situations, so Rangers and the other hybrids become worse tanks in comparison.  So we can wear plate whoopee, we won't be dodging, parrying or ripposting with anywhere near the frequency that a Ranger will.<P>But that is all neither here nor there, this isn't a Ranger thread, but you brought these points up I thought I'd address them.<P>Takeshi</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hi All, <P>i Feel i have to mention something in relation to spells that reduce mevement.<P>The ranger spell Snare. this spell also reduces movement. However when a mob is "fleeing" it's mobement can be reduced to zero. At this point, it should according to the guidelines posted by Abashi turn and attack.<P>Indeed "Grasping Roots" when cast on a fleeing mob causes the mob to "turn and attack" no longer fleeing.<P>however, in the case of the rangers "snare" spell the mob just stands there and lets you beat the living doodah out of them.<P>Now i myself play a ranger, and rely on this fact heavily, so i may be shooting myslef (and fellow rangers) in the foot here, for wich i appologise most fervantly. But what we appear to have heer is "one rule for rangers and another for bards"<P>In general i have no problems with my class, nothing i feel MUST be changed, a large number of things i "would like" to see changed.<P>WW</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I'm burying this... way deep in this thread.<P>I'm a bard.  I believe lullaby shouldn't be effective past 30.  Why? Because we get two upgrades, Crisson's and Twilight.  <P>Ester is testing those now.  The determination here will decide if I will continue playing this game or not, because I honestly do believe these are ineffective and should be effective, whereas lullaby is AoE...  There would be no reason to give us single target upgrades if an AoE song was intended to work in this situation.<P>But... this does not mean that Verant handles this situation appropriately.  Information was not forthcoming, test cases were not developed.. Ester had no idea how the song was supposed to work because noone had indicated exactly what she was supposed to be getting.<P>I truly hope that someone says "Ester, the bard mez resists on Crissons and Twilight should be for charisma A thus at mob levels a through b and thus at levels b through c etc." and then that number is the number that must be demonstrated.<P>It is not testing's fault if they are not given clear designs of what to test against.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Greetings!  <BR>Just thought I would bounce my 2 copper in here. <P>First off I am a bard, level 43.  <BR>Seeing as how the afore mentioned changes affect me directly, I would like to make a statement here.   <P>Having played most of the classes in EQ to level 30 or so,  I would have to say that the bard class is one of the best balanced classes in the game, not to mention the most entertaining. No other class can do the range of things a bard can do.  Our songs allow us to defend, to snare, and to attack all while running and cost us little to NO MANA.. <BR>No other class can do that.<BR>None.<BR>This simple ability gives the bard an incredible advantage in combat.  The down side is that you need to be awake and thinking the entire time, as you cannot take a beating as some other classes can. <BR>The mod of the chains hardly affected me.  I simply needed to change the way I dealt with MOBs that ran.  Chains in the current configuration is an excellent addition to my songs.  I have songs that allow me to attack from afar, doing substantial damage and enabling other group members to take down the Mob faster. When it bolts, chains slows its flight down. That is does not stop is inconsequential to me.  I can hit it with song at the same time I can reapply the chains. <P>While I tended to agree that songs such as Pixy Strike are very limited do to the rate that they are resisted, it is not and insurmountable issue.  You can run a resist instead of Pixy and resist the magical attack of the mob.  ( saves you from having to switch instruments while fighting too ) <P>AOE mezs are the domain of the enchanters and frankly should stay there.  Personally I dont like to have a room full of MOBs come after ME when they wake up  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>So far, nothing I have experienced modification to bards has really been negative.<BR>In fact the increased range of Selos and the Invis / see Invis mod was a big improvement.  ( THANKS for that  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"> ) <P>Just my 2 copper. <P>Munkustrap <BR>Bard of Karana <BR>ECIs  Lords of Light  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Explain to me again, just for the sake of clarity, why necromancers, masters of the undead, get a better mez than bards, the jack-of-all-trades. I guess I'm a little slow, but I just don't understand. Hmmm. I can understand enchanters being better at it than us, but necromancers? Oh well. I'm just another dumb bard that didn't know that things got a 25% chance to resist our mez song, and then a 35% chance to resist again if they missed the first one. Hmm, why not make it fair then. Give us a natural 35% chance to resist anything that can be resisted, in addition to our normal resists. Please help me understand. I like my bard. No, I love my bard. I wish it was the jack-of-all-trades I was misinformed that it was. VI, you say that we are NOT mana batteries, that we have other songs that do things. Try telling that to everyone else. I have been getting requests from my group members for "the manasong" since level 6. I am not kidding. Another thing about saying we are NOT mana batteries, that we CAN do other things. That is like telling warriors that they are NOT tanks, that they have other skills, like bind wound. Yeah! Hey warriors, you're not tanks anymore. You can heal others. That means you are a hybrid. Here, have an exp penelty. I mean no offense to warriors, just using the class as an example. Now, I know that I was exagurating a bit, but that is what it seems like to us bards, VI. I have had numerous invitations to groups, that once they find out I don't have the mana song, I am kicked out of in favor of a "better class." <P>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX<P>"Hi there.

</FONT><HR>Wow, that camelot game looks like it has promise Nayami.  I will look for a game that has a good Bard, and EQ2 having the Bard fixed or not will not be the game I play.<P>Honestly, absolutely honestly, the only reason I haven't canceled my account is that there is nothing out there right now to migrate to.  Verant is making a huge mistake on the Bard class.  They may see it is not worth the effort to fix what they should fix, with 2nd generation Online RPG's around the corner.  But the amazing fact they fail to take into account is that as the competition opens, they will have a HUGE and SERIOUS strike against them from the legacy of their attitude and position to fix what they should be fixing instead of giving lame excuses and using copouts like "vision" and "works as intended" junk when it is obviously lies.  There own words would condemn them in any jury of their peers.  The logs, chat files, etc. are there as irrefutable evidence on this matter.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
