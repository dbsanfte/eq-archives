</FONT><HR>I quit EQ back in May sometime, with well over 100 days played across a few characters, 90 or so on my primary, in less than a year.<P>I do believe cold-turkey is the only way to go, if at least for a limited time. I was also playing with my girlfriend (in the same room, at least) for the most part. After a couple months of cold turkey, I returned to the game to start new characters with my girlfriend. Even with our supertwinked druid/ranger combo the game quickly lost our interest.<P>The primary thing that addicts you, in my opinion, is the interpersonal network, and severing that network of people is required to take an objective look at the game. You quickly realize how empty these in-game relationships and friendships were when you reforge you real-live friend and family ties. If you return to the game fresh (perhaps on a new server, or as new characters) you realize how empty and dull the game is without these pseudo-friendships.<P>Please don't argue with me that you have great, lifelong friends made through the game. I'm sure some people did, and my strongest friendship to date I met on a local chat BBS when we were in our teens. What really killed these in-game friendships for me was my eventual disgust at the amount of time and effort they put into the world of Norrath. You really have nothing more in common with most EQ people, and once that's taken away, things disintegrate. Furthermore, they often do nothing but serve as reminders for wasted time you wish you could have back.<P>At any rate, I must agree that the above is correct when saying that it's not Verant's fault. Consider the glurge on the back of the Kunark CD-ROM:<P>"Welcome to the most immersive online 3D fantasy world ever created. Join more than a thousand people online and experience a never-ending quest so addictive and dynamic, you'll never want to return to the real world again."<P>They're very clear up front. Kind of scary, isn't it?<P>If you're interested in my help or experience in this endeavour, send me an email at kallista@project420.com. Best of luck.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>*Stands up and raises hand*<BR>I am an Everquest Addict.<P>Everyone in life has crutches.  For some it's drugs and alchohol, others it's material possesions.  For me, and seems like quite a few others it's video games.  It has been for 15 years when I got my first NES and Tecmo Bowl =P<P>No game has engulfed my life to the extent Everquest has though.  I started playing this game a little over a year ago, at the time I had a great job working as a VB programmer at a major airline, was going to nightschool for my MCSD and and a great relationship with my family.  As of today I'm unemployed, my marriage is on the rocks and I haven't left my home for close to a month.  Sad..pathetic even...sure, flame me if you will but it's a trap that is very easily fallen into if you allow yourself to be taken by EQ.  It's something that just kinda sneaks up on you and before you realize what's going on you've put this game before everything else that is important in your life.  I've quit EQ a multitude of times, manage to get my life back on track for awhile..then get drawn back in.  I did cancel my account a few hours ago..and look at me..it's 7 in the morning and I'm checking out the boards...addiction is a powerful thing.  If you do manage to get this site up and running, or need some help with it email me, I think it's a great thing and something that is greatly needed.<P>Coair@hotmail.com</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I know that EQ addiction is real, and I also know that it doesn't affect everyone that plays it. The only reason I play the game at all sometimes is to talk to my friends and my boyfriend. I happen to be looking around on www.webmd.com and found a message board where a woman was talking about her husband of 8 years and his addiction. That's when I realized that I was actually afraid that my boyfriend would turn into this man. He was neglecting his children and responsibilities. People with addictive personalities love to play this game, and also those who are trying to escape their lives. I notice that when I don't want to deal with the day I turn on my computer and start in, but I always find something in real life that I like more and turn it off. I think it's time for people to realize that ANYTHING can be done too much including this game. Also, there needs to be a place where people can get help <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi. I find this site/forum idea very good. I've had online addiction problems myself. Played a MUD for a year and half... (I live in Estonia (a bit south from Finland)) End was awful : lived a straight month in universities computer center. every night went to local 24h shop and bought a coca-cola and a bread. slept on days in in next class on a table with my soft coat under and over me because during daytime connection was poor. i went there on january 3rd and first time i saw daylight again was january 28th as i called my parents and told them i dropped out of school. six weeks later went to army as volounteer... it was a yearlong service. after that my life turned, for better. have a very good relationship, full time job and i'm also a student in local college. few evenings on a week i play everquest for couple of hours. but i'm not very OK. i think that i have to take a weekend off of other things and play 36 hours straight to be peaceful and happy for next few months. it works, i know.. has worked before for CIV, CIV2, MOO, MOO2, Starcraft, Brood wars, Quake3, AOE2 and others... <BR>BIG overdose lets you see that it's all a game.<BR>I'm ready to help with your website/forums and be one of those listeners who has firsthand experience. Good luck.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Darlinisme please try to see that he wasn't generalizing every EQ player but the ones who think of this game as something more. It seems you may have some sort of hostility toward psychologists to warrant such an attack.<P>I BTW was very addicted. THen one day I died, and punched my monitor. Since I'm a bit of a small guy it did nothing to my monitor, and hurt my hand alot. I realized that it had gotten TOO serious for me. I quit, uninstalled it, and started playing something else. BUt I realized it wasn't the game. It was I played to seriously. Now I take my bard around with his drum, breaking up trains for newbies, traveling. Trying really dangerous things without any fear of losing my "phat lewt" (ie: screenshots of Grimfeather [lv 17]). I know play lots less, and I enjoy it lots more. Its a game, it shouldn't be an excuse.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Secias.<P>Bravo  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.  Very nice idea.  I would like to put in my own two cents.......that a lot of the people who play EQ are the same ones who went through D&D, Magic the Gathering, multiple RPG games and finally online gaming.  It's a yearning to be somewhere other than this crappy life we lead, and I for one wouldn't mind kissing this earth goodbye and living somewhere like Aber-Toril or Norrath.  Yes, perhaps it is an addiction.....but I'd go looney without it.  <P>A side comment.......Bloodsage, SHUT THE HELL UP.  You are always expounding on the virtues of Verant, and flaming threads that even threaten their sovereignty.  Get a damn life, or at least get some tissue to clean the crap off your nose.<P>Thank you.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>For what it's worth...<P>I, maybe like others, came to this forum because I was unable to log on for a recent patch.  If I'm not playing the game, I doing and thinking about something that relates directly to it.  As I sat here reading these posts, as trite as this sounds, addiction to EQ became very real.  I found myself nodding way too much at other posts.  I've been reluctant up to this point to call myself an addict, now I'll let you decide..<P>Then,<BR>I started playing over a year ago.   Seemed fun.  RL friends played.  Back then I had a job, not a great job, but I did it well, made ok money.  My GF had just moved up to live with me.  I interacted on a semi-regular basis with friends and family.  I paid bills on time, and generally kept up with day to day stuff.<P>Now, <BR>I've been fired from 2 jobs, abandoned the third.  I play at least 50-60 hours a week.  I go out only when aboslutely required for food.  My GF for some reason is still with me, although she no longer lives with me.  My room is a mess.  I haven't paid bills in months.   Haven't done laundry in 1 month.  Havent spoken with my father in 6 months.  Everything outside EQ is quite unimportant.  And when I'm forced to interact with other, all the while I'm only wondering what I'll do when I get to play again.<P>I certainly don't blame or even think Verrant is responsible for my addiction.  I've always been looking for escapes, EQ was just the next stop.<BR>I wrote this not looking for pity, but perhaps so someone else can identify.  I'm sure I'll get flamed, but oh well.   <P>As I write this, I'm still addicted, still out of work.  I'm not sure where this ends.  The idea not playing EQ scares the crap out of me.  But I suppose this is some kind start.<P>On topic, I think the support group idea is great one.  Anything I can do to help please let me know.<P><BR>Tuaro@hotmail.com</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There is a thing that I call an "addictive" gene in some people.  Some people can gamble, drink, smoke, watch TV, whatever........and quit.  Then there are those who do those compulsively.  They don't do it due to weak will, or because they are idiots......they do it because it identifies with their need to be addicted to SOMETHING.  To belittle it due to your lack of understanding shows a shallowness that is really not nice.  <P>Armster.......your comment is akin to "Fat boy, quit being a wimp and just go on a diet" or "Geez, you must be a real wuss if you can't just quit smoking".

</FONT><HR>Hello Folks..!<P>I too can attest to the addictive qualities of EQ, back around Sept 1st I finally got up enough courage to quit the game. Seeing that I suffer from the effects of clinical depression,cerebral<BR>palsy and spina bifida, EQ provided me with a "way out" to a world were pain didn't exist and I could walk without the aide of my crutches.<P>Even though I only played for 4 months it became clear that I had to stop, there were times when I couldn't get out of my chair do to the fact that my muscles would become rigid like stone due inpart by my disability.<P>I guess I was lucky really because I spent agreat deal of my play time looking up facts and maps for the various zones in the game, I also helped people ingame with quests,giving out free money and items plus advising people over at the newbie zone.. <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>In closing I feel for those that are addicted to EQ, it took me a month to get my life back the way it was before the game and thats after suffering 2 1/2 weeks of withdrawl.. <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/eek.gif"> .<P>Good luck for those that in need/seeking  help I hope you recieve it..!<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A lot of people will post on the boards that they are leaving and never do. A lot of people consider themselves "EQ Addicts" and claim they will play, no matter how much fun that game is (or isn't), until another game of this nature comes along.<BR>I recently quit EQ a few weeks ago (for about the 2nd or 3rd time). The previous times were just a week or so breaks, but so far this break has been final. Canceled my account, uninstalled the game, and haven't been back on.<BR>One thing that make it hard to quit is friends, friends online still ask when I'm coming back, even though I really don't want to. Work has been slow so that doesn't help, but I refuse to play again. I read posts that remind me how tedious and boring the game generally is.<BR>I kind of see EQ like a person who has passed away. Once they are gone, you remember only the good things and filter out any of the bad things. I think playing EQ is sort of the same way, sure anyone can name 10 or more reasons why the game really sucks, and probably 1/2 that of why it's good but you pass off the bad things (prime example is to tell a friend about it, 'sure there aren't a lot of quests, but you can do a bunch!', when we all know the quests are few and far between and 95% not worth doing).<P>Things to help quit:<BR>get out more, and don't even log on for a minute (we have all been there when you want to play for 10 minutes and end up camping a few hours later). when kids leave home they are supposed to move so many miles from their parents as to 'break free', if they move close by, chances are they will still rely on them more then they should. when you quit EQ, it's too hard to wane off it, you just have to quit. delete the game off your hard drive (that way if you start to reinstall, you may quit before it finishes). you'll find the longer you are away the less and less you miss the game, unlike yearning to play it more and more as time goes on (as most enjoyable things actually work..i.e. can't wait to go snowboardin).<BR>when friends talk about the game, just remember the bad factors of the game and point it out to them (kind of funny how they'll deny most bad facets of the game even when they know they're wrong :)<BR>The way I see it, a lot of people playing EQ really don't want to play, but it's become a habit and they continue to play. The game has a life spawn of about 6-8 months (which is incredible for a game), most everyone I know past that has lost a great amount of interest in the game, yet they continue to play (for whatever reason).<P>One final note that the game itself does encourage a lack of real life (no wonder the people who make it, don't play it). To get most desired items in the game, it requires one to sit at one spot for up to over 12 hours at a time, chances are it taking a few chances to get it. If one works for 12 hours and comes away completely empty handed, that means something is wrong :) This is all in a game where you can't really leave your computer and end up passing by 20 minute spawn times by doing absolutely nothing, but I guess 3 kills an hour is lots o' fun (this is normal decent spawn but we all know of some that are much, much longer)...<P>just EQuit<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Verant constantly says that they do not have anything to do with the addictions.  In a sense, that is true.  Yet they also constantly say how that the game requires much time and effort to get the "best" items in the game.  (Not in those exact words, however, they speak of how they must make items "not easy" to obtain, or everyone will have them)<P>Once you do this, you are basically ASKING for people to be addicted.  If Verant's consumers weren't addicted, they wouldn't be making enough cash to keep the servers running and would have to dump EQ in hopes of making a better, more addictive game.  MMORPG's have ALWAYS been run on this ever since MUD's.  The idea is to make the consumer spend as much time as possible in order for them to be a decent character.<P>You CANNOT go to places like Veeshan's Peak right now and whatnot without being an addict.  It's not possible.  I have nearly 55 days gametime on my main character and he's only level 46 (an Enchanter, which requires much grouping). You can't blame it on Verant, though.  <P>Summary:<BR>It's not Verant's fault that so many are addicted (including me): It's MMORPG's in general.  They have to be addictive, or they they just become another console game that's beaten in a few weeks.  If you want to be good, you have to become an addict.  If you don't want to be an addict, quit the game.  There is no other alternative.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This will likely be the only time I post to this thread, but after reading a recent article on the subject I felt compelled to say something somewhere.  I don't know that I ever reached addict status but I played a lot for several months and know a few people that could be considered such.  I haven't played now in a couple of months because I thought I was spending too much time on it, but will probably get back into it to a lesser degree sometime soon.  I read a recent article about the group known as "EQ Wid's" and about a statement made by one of it's members indicating the consideration of legal action against Verant for the addictive nature of their game.  I recognize that gaming can be very addictive and that such an addiction is a serious problem, but to blame others for a personal addiction is irresponsible.  What good comes from recognizing that you have a problem if you are unwilling to take steps to correct such a problem?  We cannot hold a company responsible for other peoples actions.  If we start doing this you might as well right off the idea of responsibility entirely.  Sorry, but things like this really get me riled.  This is not intended as a flame, but rather to cause people to honestly consider their problem and to realize that while EQ may be the focus of their addiction the cause lies within themselves.  Like many things created for the purpose of entertainment and recreation EQ can be abused.  EQ is simply one of the many paths a person can take to avoid dealing with the issues of life.  Again, my purpose is not to antagonize, but to elicit thoughtful consideration.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

With both types of addiction, it is a matter of degree.<P>And if you think EQ is addictive, just wait.

</FONT><HR>I also think the idea of a website to help people with thier EverQuest addiction(s) and real life problems associated with them is a great, no a wonderful idea.  Though I would like to add-- those who say you can only play and be addicted (as in there is no casual play) are in fact very, very wrong.  Also, not everyone who plays are so into it that their lives are ruined.  In my case, I have had my primary character for over a year now.  When I first got the game I casually played... then it DID become a terrible addiction.   I would only sometimes have plans with friends, family was seen during lunch and dinner, and I would spen countless hours every day and night playing.  Luckily at the start of this school year I noticed something was very wrong with how I played.  The whole past summer I spent every goddamn day on this game, wasting over 60 days total of my life on pixels and a database.  The game was still installed... yet I stopped playing for over a month.  When I came back, I only casually played... I still talked to my online friends outside of EQ, and now when I play its only for a 1-3 hours at a time.  The game is NOT boring if you decide to do stuff besides endless camping with a group.  I enjoy very much helping my friends, n00bies, and exploring.  It does pay off in the long run... even with this casual play I have made it 3 levels (now level 45).  Also, I started a Monk who I refuse to twink, and I play him casually too... it opens a lot into the game. <P>My message really is to get the point across that you do NOT have to quit "cold turkey" to overcome this addiction.  You either quit, or recognize this is only a damn game, and real life is more important than a computer screen.<P>Flame me if you want (though there really isnt much to do so), but I am now an ex-EQ Addict and just a Gamer =)<P>Omnigear Vendetta<BR>Ryosetzu<BR>Druid and Monk of the Tribunal<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I too am addicted.  Don't know how to stop.  Wife left me a year ago due to online addiction on my part and this was before I started EQ.<P>I will disagree with not placing blame on Verant.  Sure we have addictive personalities, BUT it is verant that created quests and dungeons that take 6+ hours to do.  You can't be a casual player and participate in EQ fully.<P>I played a game called Nexus: Kingdom of the Winds and the dungeons were laid out so that it only took a few minutes to get to the deepest parts.  "Bosses" as they are called there (the highest level MoB's) could spawn anywhere inside so it reduced camping.  <P>I'm not saying it was a better game, all I am saying is it reduced the need to play for hours upon hours at a time.  To absolve VI or Sony of all responsibility is neither prudent nor fair.<P>Do I need help?  yes.  Does EQ control my life?  yes.  Just when I planned to walk away, SoV comes out.

</FONT><HR>No offense to you at all, but you really do not need the "phat l3wt" to enjoy this game.  Sure, the really incredible stuff is found off of monsters that take forever to spawn, but why are you sitting around waiting for them?  Why dont you just happen to pass by one by chance? And if a group is wasting their life camping one, just dont join and find something else to do.  You do not need incredible equipment to be successful in EverQuest (since there is no winning, who cares). I do admit I have some very nice stuff as a Druid, as I was once a huge addict (I did camp the Testament and was KSed, so I spend another 8 hours waiting for the guard to pop again... I also did the Paw of Opolla quest by taking 15 hours of my life sitting on my ass for a gold ring), but now when I started my new outlook, and started my Monkie, I noticed items and camping are not the most important thing, but just exploring, doing quests that do NOT require camping (there may not be a lot, but there are fun ones, such as the sash quests for the Monks).  Whats funny is I was playing Ryosetzu, my Monk, just a few days ago, and he is level 8.  Some guy asked me why I was wearing my Yellow Sash of Order because it has no AC and is deemed to "suck."  I simply replied that I felt good that I earned it and it was fun to get... and he just laughed.  I laughed right back because he bases his gameplay over having the best l3wt... whereas I just try to have fun roleplaying my character.  Oh well, play how you want... just trying to say that you CAN casually play this game if you finally notice your "items" are really small pixels and data on a big central computer.  Have a good life, and hope to see you in Norrath =)<P>Omnigear Vendetta<BR>Ryosetzu<BR>Druid and Monk of The Tribunal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I know I am going to get flamed for this one, but I gotta say it.<P>I applaud the people who are helping those (or want to help) people who are addicted to EQ, and possibly the Net in general.<P>But, in regards to such garbage as this group, EQ-Wids, thinking they have the right to go and file a class-action lawsuit because of this, I gotta say, you people are out of your freaking minds!<P>People who do things like this are as bad as the lady who spills McDonalds coffee on herself, knowing it's hot, and gets $10 million for something SHE did.<P>Because, once you go after EQ, then, it will snowball.  They will go after ALL online gaming.<P>Of course, someone is going to come along and say, "Boy, you must be addicted as he11!"  Wanna know something?  I'm not.<P>I play, when I can, about 10-15 hours in an entire week..not a day, in a week.<P>I have a good job, great kids, and a wonderful wife.<P>Plus, I have attention deficit disorder, and if that wouldn't make me the ULTIMATE EQ addict, I don't know what would.  If you doubt me, go ask some of your doctor friends, or try looking up anything about it online.<P>All I'm trying to say is, ok, fine, again I applaud those who wish to help others with addictions.  But to those who feel that Verant has made them victims to their addiction, I gotta say, go up, quit the stinking game, and GET PROFESSIONAL HELP!  I mean that!  If it has gone that far for you that you are losing your jobs, spouses, homes, etc., then get off your butts and go see a professional who will get you through this!<P>We now return you to your rant-free channel<P>Aurizen_Darkstar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ummm  Sorry I couldnt really bring myself to read past the first couple posts  Is this serious?  Are there really that many people out there who claim to be Hopelessly Addicted to EQ?  Are there really people out there who have neglected their families, their jobs, and their education to play EQ for 13 hours a day as one post suggests???  You have GOT TO BE KIDDING!!!  I love Ever Quest!  It has to be the best Online game I have EVER played, and Ive been playing them since the old Mud Matches!  But why in the world would someone neglect their children, their spouse, their Jobs, or their Education, and then Blame Verrant???????  Again, You HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING!!!  Its only a game!  It is the best Game I have ever seen YES!  But it is ONLY A GAME!!!  Geesh!!!!  If you dont have the capacity to restrain yourself from neglecting your family just to play EQ THEN STOP PLAYING!!!!!  Please!!!!!  For all of our sakes!  Your giving Gamers like me a Bad Name!!!  Great Companies like Verrant a Bad Name!!!  Your giving Ever Quest a Bad Name!!!  STOP PLAYING NOW!!!  For all of us who are sane enough to take Ever Quest as a Game, PLEASE!!!  I beg of you!  Go back to your families!  Continue your Education!   Go back to Work!   At least until you can come back to EQ when you have finally realized ITS JUST A GAME!!!  <P>Safe travels Everyone!<P>Stryffe Sylverfyre<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok I just read DrogonMistmaker's post, and I have to say something.  You said your own wife left you because of your Internet Disorder???  YOUR WIFE???  OMG!  I'm really sorry for the flames on this  Board, I Rarely post anything at all on these boards, but this, THIS is out of control!!!  Your saying we should blame Verant???  Verants responsible for Your Insane Actions???  Your quote un-quote, need to play for hours upon hours. Is Verants fault?  OMG!  I really wish people like yourselves would just WAKE UP!!!  ITS  A GAME!!!  The only reason you play for Hours and Hours, is because you want to level quickly!!!  So what if it takes a year to get to Level 50???  Ive been playing since Week One, and Im only Level 30!!!  AND I LOVE THIS GAME!!!  But not to the extent of Neglecting my Family!!!!  DrogonMistmaker, I must say this for your own good, GET A LIFE!!!  Go crawling back to your friends and family that you neglected!  Forget your Insane notions that Verant Made You Do IT!  Take responsibility for your own actions!!!  And quit trying to place the blame of your short comings on others, or companies!!!  GOD HELP US!

I guess the reason no-one else has posted here in a while is because they are all on EQ, continuing to ignore thier families, friends, educations, and jobs, while at the same time screaming, "IT'S NOT MY FAULT!!!

</FONT><HR>I think that anyone who's reading this board knows that feeling of I "need" to play.  As if everything else in their life is getting in the way of playing.<P>As a suggestion, it's important to remember that if you cancel your account and even delete EQ from your computer that your characters are still kept on the server for at least 3 months. So anyone can quit playing, pay bills, study for finals, pay attention to their kids, etc. and when time allows later on you can resubscribe and resume playing. Of course you might find you don't have time to play anymore.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I did not know the existance of EQ Wid's until I saw the gamers.com article.  The site I've helped create (possibly subject to a name change) is Avatars Anonymous.  We are completely not related to EQ Wid's<P>pub37.ezboard.com/bavatarsanonymous<P>And, in no way shape or form are we professing blame or action against Verant.  Maybe MMOG companies should recognize some level of responsibility in creating mentally addictive environments.... but our focus is just on helping people.<P>We also don't work in absolutes.  We don't say everyone has to quit cold turkey, and we don't say every gamer has a problem.  We advocate that gamers take a look at their gaming occasionally to make sure they are still leading a healthy and active "real" life.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Heya,<P>I've been playing EQ since BETA.... I would play non-stop and my grades in school began to slip.  Over the Xmas break, I went on a 2 week vacation (EQless).  When I got back, everyone had gained like 5-10 levels, and I felt like I could never catch up... So I quit.<P>Quit, started life back up, went back to single player games, Half-Life, AD&D etc... I did a little better... but then, In May, I turned on EQ and decided to start over.  New server, new race/class, total newbie.<P>Then I got my girlfriend in on it, and the game has gotten us into fights.  When we stay at one another's house, there's only 1 computer, meaning only 1 can go on at a time.... This leads to a problem because we both want to be online for awhile and then we both want to go somewhere else (like a movie).... it usually ends up that we argue that we never do anything anymore.<P>It sounds pathetic, and it is.  However, it's STILL NOT VERANT'S FAULT FOR THIS.  Anyway, feel free to contact me about EQ addictions - I'm always up for mail.  Rasplorien@hotmail.com is my address.<P>PS:  I thought you'd all find this interesting.  On the Ruins of Kunark box, one of the reviews says something like this:<BR>"Buy this game for a loved one that you never want to see again.  This game is more addicting than all other online games combined.  It's that good!"<P>That's kinda sick, I'm sorry, it is.<P>Rasplorien of Luclin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/031570-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/031570.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/031570-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=031570&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=031570&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
