</FONT><HR>1.  To do anything that would increase their base damage, (sweep attacks, minimum damage hits, etc) would imbalance them in regards to their designed role of being a tank.  They are not supposed to be the best damage dealers in the game, they are supposed to be the best endurance fighters.<P>2.  The triple attack they gain at level 60, basically a natural 50% haste bonus, is incredibly imbalancing in regards to their role as an endurance fighter.  Per the vision, monks are the best damage dealers.  Warriors are the best endurance fighters.  This haste bonus, which stacks with everything else, gives them the best of both worlds and should either be nerfed, or given to monks to place each class back in to their original roles.<P>3.  Since they already have considerably more hit points than other classes, to raise theirs, and not give an equal percentage raise to every other class, would be imbalancing and unfair to everyone else.  The solution here is to tone down mobs a little, not beef up the warriors.<P>4.  Increasing drop rates on cobalt armor is a rediculous.  They should be content that they even have it, as other classes do not have kunark armor, like monks and intell casters.  The low drop rate is associated with the infrequency of farming the area it drops in, not the drop rate itself.<P>5.  The ability to walk through greens would be unbalancing if given to warriors and not other classes.  The intent of greens attacking people is to generate downtime, which means people encounter more risk and ultimately play the game longer.  The faction system is supposed to address this issue.  Good faction means they wont attack.  What I would suggest is provide ways to improve every faction that can worsen, and maybe even receive experience for anything that outright attacks you without provocation.  Even if is a very small amount, is still a reward attached to the associated risk.  If I want to kill orc pawns all day for 5exp a pop, and need 30 million to get out of level, then it really shouldnt matter since I'd be playing the game a lot longer in real time played hours, and associated skills wouldn't increase which might hinder me later.  It will also spread people out too.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I need to start this post with some apologies:<P>1)I'm sorry that real life issues have made it impossible for me to read the class threads in detail (particularly since I play almost all of the classes), so I'm not certain this hasn't been discussed.<BR>2) I'm sorry that a large part of this is based on conjecture about how the "hate list" works. I don't have access to the EQ code to confirm the basis for this post.<BR>3) I'm sorry I have not done complete homework on all the weapons available to Warriors.<P>Throughout the time I have played this game, I have seen many discussions about problems with the hate list. I thought about one that particularly affects Warriors on my way home from work tonight. Many players have commented that fast attacks appear to have a higher "taunt factor" than slow attacks, even when they deal less total damage. If true, this poses a special strategic dilemma for a group's primary tank : in order to maximize his taunting he needs to Dual Wield, but in order to survive his role he needs to maximize his AC by wearing a shield. Perhaps this is what Verant intended, but many players have complained about the ineffectiveness of taunt at high levels.<P>I suspect that fixing the hate list is beyond your current project. If this is the case, then the only thought I have for fixing this is to add a new weapon to the game (and I'm not fond of fixing class balance issues with items) that:<P>a) has a moderate damage/delay rating<BR>b) maximizes the other "taunt factors"<BR>c) can be wielded in either hand<BR>d) is NOT LORE, so a player can wield 2<BR>e) gives a moderate AC bonus, such that wielding 2 is equivalent to a decent shield<BR>f) the weapon should only be usable by the class(es) deemed as the ultimate defensive tanks ( be careful with Paladins and Shadow Knights here)<P>The idea is to give Warriors the benefit of both high "taunt factor" and the AC of a shield, without altering the damage-dealing balance with other classes. I have seen some 2-handed weapons that give AC bonuses, but have yet to come across any 1-handed ones (please see my apology #3 above).<P>Thanks for your time.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

You might also notice that your weapon procs before you swing."&lt;<P>Ok, it seems that I was misinformed.  The message is displayed, just not in the right order.  I'll take that off the list.<P>Archie00 wrote:<P>&gt;"You know what I'm not going to even bother continuing this post, you're balancing the game to level 30s and 40s who will quit in 10 levels. You're going to off balance the upper level game. I can't wait for 6 months to come that warriors will be underbalanced and you will be posting 'class changes are done even if they're under balanced. YOU WILL NEVER ACHIEVE CLASS BALANCE WITH CLASS ENVY AROUND ABSOR. ACEEPT IT"&lt;<P>Well, oddly enough, I also see a lot of posts from people that think we are balancing the game to match the needs of those over 50th level.  Those people also claim that we will never achieve balance by catering to those that have reached the top levels and have become jaded.<P>In reality, neither view is correct.  There is no reason that we can't balance all portions of the game.  Making it 'balanced' for the 50+ level characters does not mean that the game must suddenly become 'unbalanced' for those under 40th level.  That's an absurd claim.<P>And we are perfectly aware of the way that class envy works.  And it has nothing to do with class balance.  The classes can be well balanced and there will still be such a thing as class envy.  In fact, I would think that class envy might be a sign of a good healthy class balance.  If there was no such thing as class envy, then that might indicate that the classes were too much alike.  Not balanced, but homogenized.<P>EvantineEssidel wrote:<P>&gt;"If you have a warrior on the ground poking at you , proding you and teasing your weak spots with their swords, shoving them under your dragonscales and uprooting them and whatnot, nicking and cutting up your sides, or scratching up your beautiful face, thats just plain annoying. Are you going to deal with him or where you feel the sudden, overwhelming shards of ice are coming from? After all, after you deal with that bothering thorn in your side, you can just kill the wizard (me)."&lt;<P>Ah, yes.  But how about looking at it the other way.  After all, once I deal with the soft and mushy wizard I can get down to dealing with that annoying  thorn in my side.  Because the caster is easier to get rid of, get rid of him first.<P>Isn’t that what players do?   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Lemme spend a moment to talk about taunt.<P>The hate list is, at least in part, one of the ways that the NPC AI determines what it's going to do.  Setting it up so that a warrior, with the push of a button, can determine how the NPC is going to act in a fight would be silly.  The more powerful the NPC, the less we want him to be controlled by the desires of the players.  After all, the higher level the monster is the more intelligent (or experienced) it is supposed to be.  What we really want is for the NPCs to act as much like PCs as they can.  How many times to you, as a player character, turn away from the caster that you are destroying just because a warrior type NPC comes up behind you and calls you names (or stick sharp things into your behind, for that matter)?  Unless he's going to kill you, you probably don't.  Killing the caster is more important.<P>So giving complete control to the warrior to decide who the NPCs attack would be a bad thing for the game.<P>There is a delicate balance to maintain, though.  And we are aware of it.  But you also need to be aware that controlling the actions of the NPCs is always going to be a group activity.  If your group works at it they can, for the most part, convince the NPC to attack the target you choose.  It requires that, for example, your casters watch how much damage they do and when they do it.  Just because they can chain cast direct damage spells does not mean that they should.  The same applies to fighter types.  It's up to the group to control aggro, not just the warrior.<P>Corrann wrote:<P>&gt;"I think what Absor is afraid of the most is if we become too good no one will want to be paly's or SK's or rangers. Don't count on it. Give them better defense, fine. Just allow our AC to matter, and fix whatever is not working in regards to AGI. I don't care if I have only 200hp's more, but I better have 150 to 200 aC more at 60, and it better matter. that's the issue it sounds like."&lt;<P>Exactly.  And those things do matter.  Warriors have more AC on their equipment, more hit points, more stamina (were a hybrid gets either Int or Wis).  And in all cases a similarly leveled warrior will have better defensive skills.  Just looking at hit points is very much underestimating the whole warrior package.<P>To put it plainly; no, we're not going to explain the AC mechanics in extreme detail.  If you observe you should see that the warrior has the advantage in all cases.  Don't focus on hit points, as they are only part of the equation.<P>&gt;"Someone else made a point about my specialization idea. knocked it because of the issue of what about when I get a better weapon? ok, I'll answer that."&lt;<P>I've been thinking about this whole specialization thing.  At first I kinda skipped it because it would require some serious time and effort to make it work.  It's certainly not something that would happen any time soon.  And, well, think about it.  Warriors that are 'specialized' in a weapon are going to be noticeably better using it.  Right now, warriors do just about the right amount of damage (again, that's kind of the problem when you're the 'base' class for something).  So we wouldn't want to increase the effectiveness of warrior damage.  So we'd have to make it so that warriors with specialization do about the same damage that they do now, and we'd have to make it so that they would do less damage than they do now with their non-specialized weapons.<P>That was my first thought on it, so I skipped it.<P>But I'll add it to the list.  It's still a good idea, in principle.  It would allow for warriors to be a little more diverse.  Though it would also favor the 'power gamer' that knows which weapons are the best to specialize in when they are given the choice.  I would hate to think that some warrior that specialized in one-handed blunt would feel unhappy about his choice later on if he couldn't keep up with other warriors that were using whatever the best option is.  That's not a major concern, but it's there.<P>So I'll add it, as a wish-list kind of item.<P>On Disarm…  well, basically, I see no way to make this skill more viable without making it far too viable.  I'll add this to the list, but I don't know that it can be made more useful.  No, I will not advocate removing the skill.  Remember, taking it out will not automatically entitle warriors to some other skill to replace it, that's not how this works.<P>Kalkorac wrote:<P>&gt;"Bind?? You guys promised more bind spots. Yes Promised. Where are they? Please??"&lt;<P>Separate issue, but still in the works.  We'll make an announcement on this when it happens.  It has not been forgotten.  But understand that we're not talking about a whole lot of new bind spots.  We're talking about a few, perhaps a couple.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>i'll admit i haven't read every post in this thread so forgive me if this idea has alread been stated.<P>about disarm, i personally don't think it should be removed but rather made more effective. my idea and this goes for all who get the skill -  <P>first increase it's effectiveness. i have maxed skill in disarm (skill of 200)and don't think it should take me 10+ tries to disarm anyone. at least not on average. sure everyone hits bad streaks but currently disarm doesn't work very well. <P>second make it actually have an effect on the dmg output of a mob. for example, if a mobs max hit is 125 with a weapon then it's max once disarmed would be 100 ( a decrease of 20% in dmg output). which is a noticeable difference. but not so much that it can't kill you or still put up a real good fight. also have this not only effect max but the average dmg it does.<P>and last, consider making a disarmed weapon not drop on the ground from a mob but go into it's inventory.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>alan, though i appreciate the fact that you don't want to talk about the mechanichs and mathematics behind the game, at this point, i personally feel that you need to. knowing how a mob is aggroed and why it chooses the target it does is slightly overbalanced. <P>things that will happen if the hate list, taunt, and aggro are properly explained:<BR>a) the whining about not knowing what ac does will stop. <BR>b) discussion about the way hybrids might be improved without "nerfing" warriors.<BR>c) warriors might be able to do their jobs better, without any improvments / nerfs being perpetrated on the class.<P>just to point out - if a warrior were given the taunt factor of a ranger, but without jolt, armor class and hit points would make the differnce. i'm not suggesting a damage output that equals a ranger's, but a taunt factor.<P>as it exists, casters have ways of figuring out apporximatly how much mana they have. warriors have no way of knowing what our taunt factor or how our ac works.<P>please - if nothing else, get taunt fixed. i don't want AoE taunt, i don't want new disciplines, i don't want ANY of the other suggestions that have presented themselves in this disucssion. i wouldn't mind two of them, but that's beside the point. <P>the PRIMARY and as far as i'm concerned, ONLY real issue with warriors is our taunt factor, or lack thereof.<P>respectfully,<BR>Siacay, Warrioress on Cazic-Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Warriors are doing the right amount of damage?  Against what?  Green mobs?<P>Here is something that can put alot of this into perspective because it needs to be done.<P>I was fighting tonite with my guild.  The group consisted of 40 cleric, 40 enchanter, 40 paladin, 40 shaman, and myself, 45 warrior.<P>We were fighting Frost Giants, in this case an Elite.  Now this mob conned even to my group and blue to me.<P>I did have a little trouble taunting him at first but later got him on me but not until he took some very good whacks at the others.  Now you have the shaman and chanter poundin this guy with spells, the pally and I are smackin and cleric watchin hp just like any plan.<P>Needless to say, the cleric CH'ed 4 times on me, the chanter and shammy were very LOM as with cleric and this guy was still at near half health.  We fought berserkers before with not near the problems.  Now I am hitting this guy and I should have taken a screenshot, with a Wurmslayer and Yak and not once hit over 35 with the WS and maybe max 20 with Yak.  The majority of the blows were below 20, including crits and crips.  Okay, his AC is up there.  Then why in the heck is he a blue smackin me for 150+ and I am maxing 35 on mine?  After a while, everyone was OOM and now he was down to maybe a quarter left, I am out of stamina by this point, the pally had to LoH to help take hits cuz the cleric was tryin to muster up some mana for heals but during all that time I was NOT doing sufficient damage even with Celerity.  Where do you guys come up with that we do the amount of damage we are supposed to?  Stats, numbers, or hardcore playtime?  If a mob that cons lower to me can smack me around like a ragdoll then somethin is wrong here.<P>What did this story all boil down to?  When the nukers and healers in the group go OOM and the counterpart on the other side can't tank or dish out enough then they are HOPING the tank can take out the mob.  I'm not going to go run around and try to find a monk or rogue or ranger.  That is when we need to be the damage dealers is when all else fails.  We do not do sufficient damage.  I have no idea where you get that from.  If I barely graze a mob and hit for 3 hp then I just want to miss because it means nothing against a mob that is conning blue with mega HP and smacking me for 150+ (not every hit mind you but far more than I).<P>I, and I think others included, do not want to be the damage dealers but at least a warrior that can deal some kind of respectable damage.<P>Or fix the cons in Velious to mean what they are.  If I can't handle a blue mob with a cleric then he should not be blue.<P>Thank You</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I just think its unfair that a good deal of casters can heal themselves to full hp as a skill or spell and its free, and we warriors not only have to pay for bandages to get out hp back, but we can only bandage up to 50%. If a caster can heal himself to full strength why cant we bandage to full strength? This is ridiculus actually. I mean at 50% bandages just stop working...Why? Its not fair to us why want to solo or duo, and have to wait forever to heal. I would be willing to deal with the fact that I have to pay for my healing ability every time by investing in bandages just to cut down on the wait time.<BR>Anyone else agree?<BR>Just my 2 cp.<P>Matrumlus DeValor<BR>Warrior 20 <BR>Cold Moon Clan<BR>Thouelles Paells<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan,<BR>if i understand your post, warriors are designed to be the main tank, while paladins and shadow knights are designed to be secondary, with a better taunt than us in case of an emergency...<P>Now if you plan on making paladins and shadow knights able to play the main tank role with the defense increase, they will be prefered in a one tank group situation (and it's often the case) because of their far better taunt.<P>Think about it: they taunt far better, hence casters can nuke really harder, therefore they don't have to tank as long as a warrior would have to because of his crappy taunt (which forces casters to nuke really slow).<P>Overall, the mob will be killed in both case, only faster with hybrids. If we don't get a better taunt, we won't be the best tanks anymore. Sure we'll take the damage better, but we have to take more of it than the others.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>to Absor:<P>Since the first offical Release i play a Barb Warrior - i got a played of around 120 days now and i quitted for some month because i felt i was left in the dust with my warrior (i never wanted to play another class, because the straight way of a warrior fits my style best. Neither do i have a Twink or Mule on my account.) <P>Now my question: HOW you balance a warrior? You staff them with all the uber gear one can get, with best weapons one can get? - Than i agree, we pretty balanced.<P>BUT right now its kind of different: I play a 54 Warrior, dressed in CRAFTED - i participated in 3 Hate raids and had NO CHANCE to get a hand on the armor there, call it bad luck or whatever, but thats the fact. Couldnt there be a way, that there are some relative easy high lvl quest that give us a LITTLE better armor and / or weapons?<P>I am kinda sick to see all those casters warrior twinks in FAR better armor than i could ever get a hand on, its kinda frustrating like hell, and i am not the only one.<P>Could you please explain me, how it is possible that SOME classes can make TONS of money and stuff i would REALLY NEED to do my job regardless if they are in an ueber guild or solo?<P>And could you please explain me, how you see a ranger wield a weapon a warrior is not allowed to equiped? In my eyes it makes no sense, that "the masters of armed combat" is unable to use a dagger or a sword or whatever (beside deity restrictions). Why aint there FAR BETTER weapons WAR only in the game - aint it the way that the parrent class should have SPECIAL WEAPONS that are so hard to control (mighty 2handers) that only a warrior can handle them (i only ask because i would love to see more weapons WAR only like the old Painbringer - sure they rotted a lot but it was POSSIBLE to get one in the old days) these days i have to ROLL against multiple classes to get an item i depent on  - and i am a looser at rolling  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>The one thing i would love to see is that you consider to give us the possibility to get a hand on the stuff you use to balance us with. Thats all.<P>E.G. it took me 96 hours to get that stupit FBSS i roled for 13 sahes, 10 of them where won by casters just to sell them or turn them in for SMR´s, STUPID isn´t it? I got my FBSS at lvl 50 and only because we did a 28 hour camp with set loot orders.<P>We are far away from the first manual explaination of a warrior - just to bring it to your mind again:<P>"Warriors are the masters of armed combat, in all its many forms. They are at home on the battlefield, and are trained to take punishment as much as dole it out, so their Hit Points are the highest of any class"<P>If i would be able to dole out the dmg i do - THAT would be my view of a warrior - but that you call unbalancing.<P>I dont see a "you are stupid helpless meatballs while not grouped, designed to get killed by greenies and left out in the dust just to beg for binds, ports, sows aso." there, but thats how i feel sometimes when i die by green mobs or been outdmged by 200% by a necro pet.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>What you think of Class Specific Armor, bought or quested but only wearable at a given lvl? Like starting at 40 you turn in your crafted with a small easy quest given from our Warrior Trainers with a little better Armor as result? Then another quest at 45 at another Trainer with another better item ... aso<P>I dont want to whine here, i only ask you to have a TRUE view on what a warrior IS and what he should be.<P>We should be the BEST class when it comes to take punishement and on par with a monk when it comes to doal out. Compare the Warrior naked with a pally naked - where is the benefit of the WAR? <P>I invite you to come over to Bertox and talk to some Warriors - you will see that the ones with the "BALANCED" gear are either in a strong guild or caster twinks. Try to find the PURE warriors (and i mean those who ONLY got a warrior on their accounts like i do)<P>Blackhunt Adbertos, 54 Champion on Bertoxx<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sorry I don't keep up with this board too often or I would have posted sooner....I'm not going to write a novel on each of the ideas so I'll just give my opinion as a person who as played a warrior since release.<P>"ITEM: AoE Taunt.<P>DESCRIPTION: The ability to 'taunt' all of the creatures in your combat range. This would have to be a high level ability, most likely a discipline.<P>STATUS: None"<P>Nice, but not very realistic in the fact that it will be a very valuable skill...especially if made a discipline with the long recycle time...I'd much rather have a few of these other ideas over this. I mean you're going to use this if a train comes along to wipe out your group...You use the AoE taunt & with the way taunt is right now, it will last all of 5 seconds...&  you are either going to die from 10 mobs beating on you, or they will just turn on the rest of the party.<P>"ITEM: Increased Hit Points:<P>DESCRIPTION: Some warriors feel that their hit points are too low, at least at the high levels.<P>STATUS: None"<P>Love this idea, sure, we have alot of hp, but it's not really that much more than the average high level player. Lots of other classes when fully buffed can easily match our hp. I think a good hp boost would be an awesome addition.<P>"ITEM: Bind Wound Improvement.<P>DESCRIPTION: An increase in the ability to bind wounds would reduce downtime for a warrior when not grouped with a healer. Of course this would also reduce their downtime when fighting solo.<P>STATUS: None"<P>Once again, it's nice, but not something I would want to replace any of these other ideas.....we don't use bind wound enough to make a difference. We already have the ability to wind up to 75%, I think that's enough. I mean really, how many warriors do you see soloing without somebody standing around to heal them. Not enough to require a bind wound buff.<P>"ITEM: Two-Handed weapons and taunt.<P>DESCRIPTION: The consensus is that slower weapons taunt less, no matter the damage level generated. If this is the case, perhaps finding some way to make these weapons taunt more would make them more popular.<P>STATUS: None"<P>LOVE this idea, I think this really needs to be looked at. We've been screamin about this for a while now. If you could fix the 2hander taunt value, it would make alot of weapons more viable, including the 2h version of the epic.<P>"ITEM: Furious discipline is bugged.<P>DESCRIPTION: Furious, the level 56 discipline, appears to be broken. It seems that it allows ripostes on all attacks, even those that come from the rear. Against attacks from the back, it prevents the attack and the damage, but then reports the 'you can't see your target' message, and fails to deliver damage to the attacker.<P>STATUS: None"<P>I think it's already been mentioned, but it's not really bugged. I mean if you're getting attacked from the back you really can't expect to riposte & hit the mob....deffinitely not something I want brough before the dev team to take the place of some of these other suggestions.<P>"ITEM: Cobalt Helm and Bracer.<P>DESCRIPTION: Players feel that the drop rate on these two items is far lower than it is on the rest of the Cobalt armor, and they would like it increased.<P>STATUS: None"<P>Yes, please for the love of all that is holy fix this. We've been posting & bumping about this for months now....Cobalt bracer & helm are FAR too rare & require a kings ransom to be able to aqcuire one from the lucky soul who ended up with it. Yes, it's alot more rare that the other cobalt pieces....but more inportantly it's FAR more rare that all the other class armor pieces & on mobs that are a hel of a lot harder as well.<P>"ITEM: Critical hits for low damage.<P>DESCRIPTION: When a warrior gets a critical hit, having it hit for less than a normal hit can be distressing. Perhaps putting a minimum damage on a crit (or raise it if there is one now) to be close to their normal maximum damage would be a good idea. So, if the damage generated is less than their normal maximum, raise it to that maximum.<P>STATUS: None"<P>Like this idea, I could deffinitely go on a damage cap on crits like rogues got for backstab....tired of seeing a crit for 50 when I can hit for over 200 normaly.<P>"ITEM: Better Taunt.<P>DESCRIPTION: Warriors want to be able to taunt more effectively at the higher levels. It may be, though, that the problem isn't with their ability to taunt, but with the taunting of other classes. Also, players are not supposed to be able to dictate the actions of higher level monsters. They are supposed to be smart enough to kill who they think needs killing, and they are not supposed to be tricked by simple name calling… But this should be looked at along with the big picture, perhaps warriors should have a greater ability to taunt.<P>STATUS: None"<P><BR>PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, enough said =)<P>"ITEM: Piercing skill cap.<P>DESCRIPTION: As the masters of all weapons, do they not deserve the highest cap on all weapon skills?<P>STATUS: None"<P>I won't argue with this one...I don't see the harm it putting our piercing cap the same as the rest of our weapons....not like we are going to start backstabbing for 500.<P>"ITEM: Berserker Frenzy as a skill.<P>DESCRIPTION: This has the potential to be significantly overpowering, but it's certainly interesting. The idea is to turn berserking into a skill or discipline with a recycle time and a duration that balances out the fact that they can do this at will. This might also mean the removal of the berserk code for low health. Perhaps the berserk skill would drain stamina and then, when stamina was gone, hit points.<P>STATUS: None"<P>Nooooonononononono, I like the way it is now, it keeps us from that slow deathmarch when you are low hp & it works beautifully in conjunction with Mightystrike discipline....if you changed this to a skill or /disc, alot of high level warriors would be *very* upset.<P>"ITEM: Iksar Planar armor.<P>DESCRIPTION: It seems there isn't any.<P>STATUS: None"<P>I'm not really up to par on my iksar stats, but they have pretty good ac with thier ac bonus do they not....not to mention they can wear PoG & Champions armor effectively giving them the highest ac of any warrior class.<P>"ITEM: Respect.<P>DESCRIPTION: The idea here would be that a deadly warrior shouldn't be jumped on by little green beetles when wandering back to his corpse. They should fear his dangerous fighting power. The gameplay point here is that warriors have no way of travelling safely among otherwise annoying greens. Where a caster would go invisible, a warrior has to fight off hordes of weak enemies.<P>STATUS: None"<P>Not a real important issue, but deffinitely something I wouldn't mind seeing....like having anything 10-20 levels lower NOT attack us or con apprehensive. I mean seriously, *WE* wouldn't attack anything 10-20 levels above us...<P>"ITEM: Nothing to look forward to from 35th to 50th.<P>DESCRIPTION: There are no skills for a warrior to gain in this level range. One suggestion about what could be added is some sort of sweeping blow skill that would allow a warrior to hit multiple targets within his combat range. This should probably only work with a two-handed weapon. The skill would be linked to the Bash and Kick timers, and would probably not do full damage to each creature, perhaps only doing a comparable amount of damage with Bash.<P>STATUS: None"<P>Yes I agree we should get something within that level range, but the sweepong blow is a bad idea....it's one of the reasons AoE weapons are a bad idea....most groups have enchanters & if we get some AoE attack that we never use, well I'd just be sad =).<P>"ITEM: Equiping shields on the back.<P>DESCRIPTION: Allowing shields to be used in back slots. A popular idea, and it makes some sense, assuming the shield only gave an armor class bonus from the back.<P>STATUS: None"<P>LOVE THE IDEA....that's all I'm gonna say about that.<P>"ITEM: Riposte damage report.<P>DESCRIPTION: Some would like to have the damage they do with a riposte reported to them.<P>STATUS: None"<P>It's already reported, it just doesn't say "You riposte for 60dmg" it just happens and you hit the mob.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ayw Well there are to things i need to respond to in this thread.<P>1 AE "Swinging Blow"<P>This (as the idea is now)is not a good one, for the shear fact that it would kill your group at higer level. I.E. being that if you pulled lets say the whole lord rom to your group you chanter (and you dam better have one, that or a good cleric friend to come donw ther and res your arse) can handle the pull because of mes.  The AE swing would, if used break all the meses on all the mobs forceing th cahnter to try to get off a second mes while 5 froglock + the lord tounge her to death!  If this would be added to the game it should not break meses kinda like a de-buff.<P>2 Cobalt and Uber War only Weapons being no drop.<P>I was in a group camping some cobalt , which i thought would be lottoed off betwen the 3 warriors in the group.  To my dismay, the group lottoed it between the whole group and a druid one the lotto and promptly looted and left the group to go sell the armor!!!!  (BTW to thoes that say the spells on the cobalt are useless...well not to be an arse but we are not spell casters and don't have mana so if nothing we have thoses "spells" on are armor to help us on when soloing...hahahhaahhahahahhahahah...hehe a soloing warrior...lol!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I have an idea about critical hits and weapon specialization. I am thinking along the lines of AD&D which this game is based on. I know this game is not AD&D, but the basic concept of similarity between the two games is important.<P>Critical hits - You would never see a critical hit in AD&D do 12 dmg when your top amount of dmg is 120 dmg with a particular weapon. In my opinion, a critical hit shoud ALWAYS do at LEAST as much damage as the highest amount of damage that particular weapon can do. It is a criitcal hit - it should do damage accordingly. You don't put someone in the hospital and list them in critical condition when all they have done is stub their toe. A fair trade off to ensure the crit hit did at least the maximum dmg of a particular weapon is to reduce the frequency of them. Same for crippling blows...but make them at minimum twice the maximum dmg of the weapon and reduce their frequency as well. A crippling blow should mean just that - MASSIVE damage that cripples or severely damages the opponent. <P>Weapon Specialization - My idea for that, though it may sound too powerful, is to make the chosen weapon do at least half the dmg it does for a maximum hit. That is hard to follow, I know, so I will give an example. With my Wurmslayer I can do a maximum of 120 dmg in one blow (and those hits are VERY RARE). If 1HS is my specialization then I should never hit for below 60 dmg with that weapon. All too often I see the numbers 3, 5 and 12 coming up for dmg...with a Wurmslayer...a huge deadly polearm. That is so weak. While you might call this a balance issue I call it overlooking the obvious. I, for instance, am an Ogre Warrior with 218 strength unbuffed. If a weak little Halfling Druid can hit for up to 40 dmg with a 20 dmg staff, does it not make sense that I should ALWAYS be hitting for more damage with a silimar weapon than a weak little Hobbit?<P>I think Verant is doing a good job by looking at the class issues. I am not trying to suggest that Warriors become all powerful gods with the ability to solo dragons. I am suggesting a more realistic approach to the melee system as far as damage and weapon usage is concerned. Thanks for listening. =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>JEEEEZUS Verant!<P>*** are you guys trying to do to warriors?<P>Warrior Nerfs<P>--- Aggressive and Defensive disciplines have been fixed. Before they would only affect damage taken and not affect damage dealt out. Now they affect both as designed.<BR> <BR>--- We reduced the amount of hate that can be caused by a proc. Due to the high proc rates at upper levels, the amount of hate generated from procs, and the spells that were selected for those procs, made keeping the attention of the creature much too easy a task for the tank. Simply, it nearly eliminated the challenge of keeping a foes attention at levels above 50.<P>--- We've redressed the amount of hate generated by heal spells. Previously, and *partly* due to a bug, the high level heal spells such as superior heal or complete heal would generate no more hate than greater heal. In fact, so little hate was generated by these spells that it made controlling NPC aggression trivial. Heal spells will now generate an amount of hate more in line with the number of hitpoints actually healed. Due to our desire to leave the lower level game more or less untouched, two separate caps have been placed for targets level 50 or below, and 51 or above. Heal spells will generate significantly less hate for targets below level 51 than those at or above that level.<P>--- Paladins, Bards and SK's given same defensive Skill caps as warriors<P>--- Rangers given identical offense and weapons skills as warriors<P>Warrior Fixes<P>--- Increased the pre-50 bind-wounds cap for rogues and warriors. <P>--- The Wurmslayer will now fit in a bag.<P>So basicaly what we have here, is VI took our two best disciplines and made them worthless.  We can use defensive now, but we won't be able to deal out enough damage while using it to taunt a mob onto us.  I guess its now just a discipline we can use when its time to run away.<P>They reduced the hate generated from procing weapons, which really screws over warriors who used weapons like bloodpoints, Kunzars, Snare Whips and other things to help in our taunting ability which is extremely underpowered right now.<P>They nerfed clerics now, so that its gonna be even HARDER than it already was to keep the mobs off of them when they cast their high level healing spells.  I have a feeling this is gonna make those clerics a little scared to use their complete heals on tanks in general now, resulting in lots more death and heartache.<P>And the real kicker... is that hybrids now get all the skills that used to be advantages for warriors.  We gave all types of useful abilities such as casting spells, tracking, being self sufficient and the like just to have an edge in melee combat and they go and strip it away just like that.  I'm glad for the hybrids, but what makes warriors worth having around now?<P>They did give us a couple fixes... bind wound, and our wurmslayers go in bags now.  *Emphatic Cheer*  Ya know what... I'm gonna stick my Wurmslayer in a bag... wrap it up in bandages... turn the sucker sideways and stick it straight up Verant's CANDY @$$!<P>If you want to find me in-game from now on, just /tell Vaugn.  He's my 19th level Half-Elf Ranger.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>COMMENTS<BR>AoE taunt discipline once every 60 minute, good idea, let it replace Riposte. hihi<P>Increased Hit Points? all tanks should have more HP. caster maybe got half the HP of a tank but they got self buffs that give them almost the same HP as a tank. seriously..<P>Bind wound improvement? This will mean you can solo to good and then we have to nerf your combat skills to balance the game.<P>Furious discipline is bugged.. mobs can be hit in the butt when they Enrage, so it must be a bug that your not.<P>Better Taunt. Stand closer to the mob or bonk the wizard.<P>ITEM: Respect.(green mobs chasing naked warrior) Free lunch, if you want invis we have to nerf even more of your combat skills.<P>Iksar planar armor. Plane of growth<P>ITEM: Nothing to look forward to from 35th to 50th. Sweeping attack, people will only say it do to little damage and that warriors got screwed again.<P>LAZY SPOILED KIDS<BR>You stupid people want warriors to level fast, tank twice as good as a hybrid, do much more damage, use bandages that heal better then a cleric and not getting hit by mobs when you recover your corpse. <P>So why didnt you make a hybrid then? they can do alot of the stuff your asking for. But no, you want to level fast and have their abilities BUT not the drawbacks of a hybrid.<P>FACT<BR>Stop being so stupid, defence skill only add more ac, ac do next to nothing in this game, the most important skill that make a warrior so much better at tanking is Dodge, Riposte<BR>and Parry. All these skills eliminate one full attack that a hybrid would get on his forehead.<P>QUESTION<BR>Give me one good reason to play a hybrid if a warrior would be twice as good at tanking and get all the hybrid abilities? Sure, let verant change all hybrid players to warriors because they suck so hard anyways.<P>FINAL THOUGHTS<BR>I would be amazed if the hard work that I have had to put in my character because of hybrid penalties actually would mean that Im better then the warrior that took the easy way. Whats the point of taking exp penalty AND then being useless at what I do? you cant be punished twice for the same crime. AND why does it upset a warrior so much when a hybrid finally get a group then if a fellow warrior get one? what kind of %&¤#¤ are you anyway? Theres like 10 warriors for every hybrid because they suck and you get mad because they get alittle better chances at finding a group?

</FONT><HR>Absor.  Please please please I'm begging you to listen here.<P>The statement that Warriors will have better AC and HPs than other classes is not really accurate.

And yes we will have maybe 300 or 400 more hps than Hybrids at higher levels.<P>BUT.  ALL high end warrior armor is SUPER rare and even if it drops you have a very small chance of getting it. And even with it hybribs can come close to us in AC.  If my AC is 1080 and a pally's is 1060 honestly its not that big of a difference.  (and if the AC soft cap is really 1100 then there is no difference at all)  And the HP difference is laughable.  A MOB in Sebilis or any high end Velious zone can do that much damage in one round or less.<P>So what I am saying is that in LITERAL terms you are correct.

Hybrids will now have close to or better AC than us due to the new changes and come very close to us in HPs.

</FONT><HR>Yes AC can make some difference, but in the long run if you get 3 hits in a round because you are a hybrid with no fighting skills and a warrior get just one hit, that means he can fight 3 times as long as the sucky hybrid. Right now hybrids have less skills AND crappier equipment then a warrior. To balance things out, Shadowknights and paladins should have had bigger armor the warriors since they get hit 3 times as much, rangers should have had higher dodge skill. Hybrids arent in the game because the warriors have to be better then another class. They are a class that should be just as good as any other.<P>And that nonsense about "have you heared about stuns". Well have you heared about Mana? using stuns everytime you fight means that you have to sit down with the casters instead of pulling and killing more mobs. And please dont say "hybrids can solo" soloing is as time effective as killing orcs in Crushbone, you get crap exp and even crappier thanks to exp penalty. I get exp penalty because I have some extra spells to play around with, they arent as good as you think.<P>If you do wanna nag on some class trying to take your job, look at the new mage spell, Fearless pets spell. Hooray, now the pets do 5x60dmg/ round. cant be feared/backstabb/drains/taunts like a god and got twice the hp of a small army. Imagine how mana effective a CH on a pet with 5000hp is. And if the mage gets in trouble, he run away and CoH himself in a corner, bye aggro no need to gate or die. who need a tank anyway.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sigh Now that I'm nearing 40 and Will be going to the Kunark type Dungeons it does seem that I'll have a lot more trouble finding groups. Right now when I ooc 37 WAR LFG it takes me a while to find a group but once I get one they like me well enough. I do the meat shield thing well. I don't run, I don't cry for heal when I get to 2 bubs and start running and I stand there and take it like a good lizard till the group is safe or the mob is dead. I stay on target and let the crowd control/ healers do their job unless we have a secondary tank to peel adds of the casters and a backup healer to keep the secondary tank healed. In short I do my best to be the meat shield I die so the rest of the group lives . Then I get a res and fight again. Sure I lose some xp but if the group lives then they don't break up and I get the xp back pretty quick. I don't cry about all the twinks outdamaging me or when the ranger/SK/Pally is out taunting me. I live with it because I know I'll still be up when they fall, at least at this level. But now that the hybrids get the same defence as me I can't say that. They are now even more attractive as a main tank. They taunt better hit as well and cast, heal, DoT, whatever . <BR>Bravo to them for all the fixes they recieved, they needed many of them . I don't care that some of them can now hit just as well as me, let them. But if they can take damage just as well as me then I lose my whole identity. As many people have said, If it's a choice between an sk and a warrior the sk wins hands down in a group and since they got rid of the penalties as far as making a new character goes they will be more popular there to, I suspect there will be a flood of SKs over the next 6 months and fewer and fewer high level warriors as the newbies discover the limitations of our class. But I'm to far into this one to start over and my other main character is a 30 mage that will also be undesirable at higher levels . So it seems that I can look forward to playing Starwars when it comes out because there is little reason to take either of my best characters past 50.<BR>I do appreciate the raise in BW skill . It's only useful as a mana saver for the healers between fights, who in my experience love when the tanks bind wound to 50 after a fight although so few tanks bother learning this skill, and for the rare occasion that I solo which is usually just to farm not for xp. The AC issue does need some looking into just to keep warriors above the other tank classes in that department, again an identity issue. More HPs ? yeah I'd like that, at 37 I have 1262 but at 50 + people only have about 2k ? Should be more per level or at least give us more of a stm bonus. I an AoE taunt ? nah don't want it  . A better taunt 2HS? want that a lot. A better taunt all around ? yeah could use that too. <BR>Many of the issues raised I wont see for another 10-15 levels but they seem valid in most respects . My big disapointment is the huge advantage of sks/pally/rangers in groupability now. Every group should want a warrior at it's core, I always thought this was a basic tenent of roleplaying in general and EQ in particular. The other tank classes used to be good backup tanks/caster/healers and filled their roles well. Now they fill my role and have added functionality  in a group setting as well as an ability I'll never have , the ability to solo while waiting on a group. When I log on and LFG all I can do is sit at safe point and wait. The hybrids can at least kill some blues while LFG and get some xp. At my level most blues kill me or take me so low in HP that I get killed by the first train past me. Now I'm not saying this out of class envy . I LOVE being a tank I LOVE standing there calling the mob names and getting spanked and not falling over dead in 3 hits like my mage does . I love playing my war but the higher I get in levels and the more Verant "fixes" class balance the less I get to do my job because I can't find a group and can't solo so I can't play. I don't want to solo, I hate soloing, I love the group dynamic it's why I play EQ. But often I find I sit for hours trying to get a group doing nothing but chatting in Guildsay. Now I guess I'll have to get even better at typing for the increased guild chat time I'll have or play my Mage ( solo since even now at 30 mages are unwanted in groups ). And all I can see is more of the same for both my characters. Sometimes I wish I'd have stayed on AC instead of letting my freinds talk me into playing this . I left a perfectly good archmage at level 18 there heck I'd be in the 60's by now if I'd stayed.\<BR>oh well at least i get a minor pet sow for my mage now.

</FONT><HR>well don't say we chose the easy way, we can do only ONE thing in this game, and it's tanking.<BR>An hybrid's life is way easier, and that's why you had exp penalties.<BR>I agree that we can still take punishment a little better than hybrids, BUT we can't taunt, and it won't get any better with this patch. I could have twice my hp and ac, it would be useless if i can't taunt.<BR>Give it a try, go to lower sebilis and try to taunt a myconid using ONLY your taunt button... <P>reminds me i have to make my "i see dead people" social</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have yet to meet a Warrior that cant taunt. I usually aggro the mob on me and then back up alittle so that I can pass it on to the Warrior. The trick is to get in really close. Thats one thing I hate about Rogues and Monks. They usually get in really really close and giggles when they get hit and say "cant you taunt it please".

</FONT><HR>Here's my thoughts<P>1) AC & HP's<BR>   Warriors should DEFINITELY have greater AC and MUCH greater HP's.  I'm talking about perhaps 25% more hp's over hybrids and maybe removing the AC cap for warriors only.<P>2) Disarm<BR>   As we all know it's basically useless except in PVP.  I really don't care if it's fixed or not as it neither adds nor detracts from gameplay.<P>3) Shield on back<BR>   Sure, this would be a nice thing.  However, unless the AC cap is raise/removed it is useless at higher levels.<P>4) HP regeneration<BR>   I do like the idea of having a discipline or a meditation-like skill to increase HP regeneration.<BR>Or, if HP's would not be raised perhaps warriors could be made to regenerate HP's faster than other classes.<P>5) Specialize weapons<BR>   A good idea, but you screw yourself with the slash only epic weapons if you choose any other skill. <P>6) Critical Hit damage<BR>   Yes, it's irrating to get small critical hits.  Someone had posted an interesting idea of adding a stun to any crit/crip hits.  That would make good sense as any "critical" hit would stun a creature.<P>7) Pierce cap<BR>   It is ridiculous to have pierce capped as it is.  Rogues will out damage warriors with their backstab ability always and some weapons are warrior only piercers.  <P>8) Stats discussion<BR>   People talk about uselessness of AGI.  All I have to say is that if you want to tinker with how stats effect play at this point, you better be able to let characters reallocate their extra points.  People allocate those points according to current coding.  To change that coding would REALLY upset a lot of high level people.<P>9) Sweeping Blow<BR>   While this is nice in concept, there is one HUGE problem.  No, it's not hitting mez'd MOB's.  If you do that you're a fool for using the ability around them.  The problem is on any PVP servers it will be an almost useless skill.  It's bad enough we have to deal with AE stuns affecting party members.  I know the majority of the players are on PVE severs, but please stop to think of the thousands playing on your PVP servers.<P>Thanks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000458-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000458.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000458-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000458-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000458-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum13&number=13&thisthread=000458&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum13&number=13&thisthread=000458&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
