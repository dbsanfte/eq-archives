</FONT><HR>You can read the previous discussion here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/039117.html<P>And here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/040527.html<P>Silh<BR>Station Member posted 12-08-2000 11:55 AM <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>(Disclaimer: I'm a french player, please excuse my english)<BR>The enchanter has been my primary and favorite class since day one. I've played EQ since his launch and I am now after all this time a level 42 enchantress. I enjoy playing EQ every day and it's surely the best game I have ever played. My post is not to tell you how weak my class is, or how you should nerf another one. I know very well how powerful enchanters are. It's not a post about power. I like our mind controler aspect. I have one of the best group in Norrath (having a well trained group is a requisite for an enchanter) and have done the hardest dungeons at the right levels everywhere on Odus, Antonica, Faydwer and Kunark (not Velious since I'm a euro player ). My point here is: I really love this game, and would never have had the idea of writing this post if you hadn't extinguish lately with Velious my latest hopes concerning one important part of my enchanter's enjoyment : illusions. Sure there has been some nerfs in the past but nothing that was enough disturbing to force me to take my computer and write a letter.<P>To be totally honest I have not chosen the enchanter class for the illusions. It was a nice bonus...no it was a VERY nice bonus to my gaming enjoyment. I'm more the roleplayer type, and being able to change form in a game where customization of my character is not the major feature was a blast. A breeze of fresh air in all the fights in dungeons .<BR>However I think you have been very unfair to us in your decisions on the subject of illusions so far. And lately you have crossed the line for me. <P>Let me first summarize the history of illusions for enchanters. Please note how things have happened and the feeling the average EQ enchanter player can have in front of Verant attitude.<P>Like many enchanters I was surprised to discover that we do not have illusions past the level 44 (and only one at 44). When enchanters asked for finishing the spell line we were told that there was technical issues that stopped you adding new illusions in the game: The character global files (a name like that), which contains all the models that should appear in all zones (players and pets) had a size limited by the old 3D cards. EQ had to be compatible for people with those devices. <BR>Fine. Something I can fully understand.<P>Enchanters have then proposed to Verant many ideas to go around this limitation. For example: illusion gender, illusion copycat : copy living creature (like minor illusion with living things), illusion animation (our pet). I dont know why they were discarded. For me it was a positive thing that players suggest ideas to you, and ideas that can work and are not unbalancing in any way. <P>With the first expansion (Kunark) we were all waiting for the new illusions. Post 50 spells for enchanters meant some illusions for us ? Nothing. Except illusion iksar. What a surprise to discover that there was indeed some room inside this global file. Ok, you were keeping the room for the new iksar race. Again I can understand, except I do not like very much the fact that you didnt tell us the truth at first.<P>The first disatisfaction for me came with illusion spectre given to necros. After telling us there was no room for a new model, you change your mind... and obviously not for the one that were asking for it. Let me tell you I felt bad : a pet was most important in your eyes than a player. Ok, ok, I know there is a player behind every pet, but that's the way i felt at this time. Again, I can understand that you chose to give some of this precious room in the global file to necros instead of us (it's your game after all), although i felt a little betrayed. <P>At this point, we, enchanters were quite confident over the fact that you were giving us in the near future a spectre illusion. There was this time no technical issues, since the model was already in the global file. Second big surprise : you chose NOT to give us the illusion. Reason behind ? You told us there was another technical issue (sigh) : the spectre model has too many polygons and enchanters running everywhere in spectre illusion could create lag. <BR>Even today it's something I simply dont believe. It was blatantly not the true reason, but you didnt want to tell us the real one.<BR>And with Velious Necros got illusion spectre. Hmmm. And you deny it to enchanters again. Hmmm.<BR>Again: Ok, I could try to forget that necros are the only one to get a new model. I will insert here what I think is the true reason, which I can almost accept : A lich/spectre form for necros as the supreme spell of their spellbook should have no rival or else you would lose the really cool and unique aspect of this power. Even if it's only an illusion for enchanters, with no bonuses at all, the fact that another class have it would take a part of the "coolness factor". (please remember this argument when you'll come to the last section of my post)<P>What irritated me the most on this subject was that you never answered clearly. Abashi said, if I remember correctly that the spell had a "high level of coolness". Sure it had. At the same time you were telling shamen that their shrink spell could not be used outdoor because It would have been purely a fun spell with no purpose and you didnt want that. I simply dont understand this double-reasonning (and I've never played a shaman in my life). We have entertaining-only illusions (all the undead ones which let me KOS with skeletons !). Fun is obviously a good reason for the existence of a spell. Why necros can have fun spells and not shamans ? Little disturbing to me.<P>Back to our enchanter point of view. Ok so you gave necros a spectre pet, then a pet illusion, everything that was asked by enchanters to have their last illusions has been discarded. Ok.<P>Now Velious. We were (at least I was) hoping that something would come from this frozen continent. After all the previous requests for completing the illusion line of spell, and the necro issue, I was sure you would do something. Let me tell you that it was a big disillusion.<P>In velious Druids get a bear pet. Chamans get a bear illusion. No bear illusion for enchanter. Indeed: no illusion at all. Once again you told us that you have found new room in the global file for the bear model. Not for us. I felt very bitter at this point. I had the feeling you were giving purposely the new illusions to all classes except the one that was asking for. But since it's not a reasonnable attitude for a company I think now it's not the case.<P>All these changes have contributed to a vast disatisfaction concerning the illusion issue. However it's true I was stil the master of illusions. Other classes got new changeform spells ? Good for them. I have no upgrade on this topic ? That's your right to not improve my class. But the last and most important change that came with Velious has simply destroy my last hopes and my actual enjoyment on illusions. You have given the summon monster line of spell to the mages.<BR>This one change has vastly change the way norrath will look like and my illusionnist role in the world. How is it you gave to mages our old proposition of copycat spell for their pet ? How do you expect me not to see this as the ultimate betrayal ? After all this unclear attitude and answers on the illusion issue, I hope you understand how betrayed I can feel. I was -really- having faith in you Verant. I really thought that with Velious we would gain new illusions. We have seen other classes getting illusions with spells, items and so on. But after 2 years I was still hoping for something to come. And you gave more illusions to the mages pet that I could possibly mimic with all my spell line !<BR>This is disheartening.<BR>I have lost the faith. <BR>And it's not the usual complaint: "someone is getting what i wanted yada yada yada". I will explain why I feel the mage spell was a terrible blow to my illusionist aspect. It's absolutely not the same as the previous spells given to other classes. You have given mages a way to create and control virtually all creature types (not stats but appearance) of the world. I know it's not an illusion, but for me really the distinction here is very small. They have access to more appearance than me, the enchantress, will ever be able to imitate, even in my wildest dreams. I feel as if I am not anymore the master of illusions. I know it's a pet but that's how I feel. <BR>And it's worse than that. <BR>You know, there was something "magic" with my class. I could surprise people. You know the feeling it is to be "special" in a world where everyone looks the same ? I know that very soon, due to the number of mages in the game, everyone seeing two monsters fighting again each other wont be stunned anymore. "Oh that's just a mage pet" will be the standard reaction. I used to amaze myself each time I saw my charmed mob fighting another mob. A mob fighting a mob is a terrible sight . Think of Hill giants ! Now it will rapidly become -trivial-. All the mages going across Norrath with giant, spider, gnoll, froglock, griffon pets will trivialized what was something unique and rare. <BR>You have taken this little magic aspect of my class, the "wow" factor that I was so proud about. <BR>And for THAT Verant I blame you so much. <P>I know many people who chose to start an enchanter for these illusion tricks. With the illusions, ALL the possibly imaginable illusions, given to the pet of a mage, I'm now a second-class illusionist. Not even that. In the game there are NPC enchanters who can turn into aviaks, Sarnaks, gnome robots. I'm limited to a poor set of illusions. I'm ashamed to see what mages can do in comparison. <BR>I know perfectly that you wont change anything. I'm not even asking for it. Mages deserve a good spell like that. But the right move was certainly not giving away all the illusionnist aspect of my class to them. I feel very sad about all this stuff.<BR>You know I have come to the explanation of all of this after some reflexion. I see the big picture now. Look at all the new spells introduced in this game after the initial release, especially the expansion ones: VERY few new spells. What you see is : <BR>- upgrades to old spells<BR>- Spells from one class given to another one<BR>Not new spells.<P>That's a tendency that I really dont like in EQ. You are overlapping what all classes are able to do. Although it seems good at first sight, I think it's not the right decision. I'm not the integrist enchanter type which think he should be the only one to cast mez: I was very happy that bards get after such a long waiting a correct mez song. Giving mez to necros was however totally inconsistent with the class. You shouldnt blur the frontier between the classes. There is always a roleplay explanation to give something to someone. But you have to draw a line and dont mix everything. Else you are destroying the reason why someone want to play a specific class. <BR>How about giving feign death to enchanters ? It makes sense, it's just an illusion corpse, right ? NO. Because feign death should not be given to everyone. I know it's easy and tempting to get the code of one spell and give it to another class under a new name and hop voila, a new spell is born. You are killing class diversity. Think again at the UO "tank mage" stereotype. We are far away from it in EQ but you are leaning this way. Really it's not the right direction. Please please respect the class specialities. There's no mystery why everyone plays a druid in EQ: they can do every little thing the other classes can, even sometimes better than the specialist classes ! The diversity and a sense of distinction between the classes is -necessary-. <BR>I know it's too late for the summon mob spell. But please acknowledge it was a very bad decision. You didnt had to take a code obviously targeted at the enchanter class (2years waiting...) and give it to the mages. <P>My fear actually is that the spell design team has moved on EQ2, err... "another project" as you name it. You are not creating new (=potentially unbalancing) spells for the game anymore, but simply moving spells between classes. If it's a design choice, you have to know that this choice for me has been the worse nerf to my enjoyment in the game to date. EQ is not about hack and slash only. I used to love my "surprise them" abilities. They are dead. Charm and illusions in one single move are going to be trivialized. Enchanters were few and their capacities so surprising. Now all the mages out there will make their visual effects common place. End of the "magic feeling" to be a little "special". <BR>Now I know that no new illusions will ever come. Sorry, but I have lost my faith in you. I believe the "no upgrade policy" about enchanters is due to our reputation on the boards to be crucial to all high level expeditions, to be god-like and so on. It was more simple and honest to tell us the truth you know. <BR>Even if new illusions were to come, now that mages have all the possible illusions in a spell line, how could I rival ? I'm not the master of illusion anymore. In my eyes at least.<P>Thanks for reading me. (and I hope you did)<P>Silh, a disillusionned enchantress<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Totally, off topic, but I have to respond to this, because it typifies everything that is wrong with Verant and EQ.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, you've kinda got that backward. First, there has to be a company to make decisions and create the game. THEN comes the market to drive the game's success.<P>Nobody in their right mind creates a game they don't think has a market.  And even if somebody DID want to create a game with no market, nobody would pay for it.  Sorry, but the 'market' is out there.  You didn't create it.  Verant didn't create the market.<P>Now go back into your delusional little world where you're all gods, and everquest is a perfect game.<P>All along, I've wanted this game to be the game it could be, the game it wants to be, the game it PRETENDS to be.  And all along, it's been the ego of the developers that holds it back.<P>Because obviously, you created the market for rpgs.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am not an illusionist but I have an opinion (and a somewhat unbiased one) so hey.. what the heck.<P>What this long (very long) string of posts boils down to is this:<P>1) Enchanters want more illusions.<BR>2) Many Enchanters want Spectre and bear.<P>Thats mainly (aside from flames and a few off the wall posts) that these threads boil down to.<P>1)  Its perfectly reasonable that Enchanters would continue to want more illusions.  As the game progresses and more spells are added there would certainly be an expectation of more illusions.  Verrant has said that they will add more so arguing for more is a pointless.  The only bone of contention is what they will add.<P>2)  There are three potential bonuses for an illusion, appearance, faction, and (at higher levels) stat bonuses.  The only concern to Verrant should be if a potential illusion is game unbalancing.<P>-Spectre<BR>   -appearance: spectre-not a game mechanic issue<BR>   -faction: undead-not a game mechanic issue, enchanters can already get this with other spells.<BR>   -stat bonus: +20 desease protection? (just a guess), levitation-not a game mechanic issue, enchanters can already get this with other spells.<P>I don't see any reason why Verrant would not give enchanters this.  It has minimal game impact and would please alot of players.  The argument that enchanters should not have any undead spells is a moot point and a waste of discussion.<P>-bear<BR>    -appearance: bear-not a game mechanic issue<BR>    -faction: bear-similar to druids and rangers?-this could be a game mechanic issue-Verrant might not want to give a faction base that is presently held exclusively by rangers and druids<BR>    -stat bonus: none-this would be a low level spell and would have no stat bonus (Its a BEAR)<P>Only thing that would hold this up would be the faction bonus impact on game balance.<P>A more profitable discussion might be suggestions offered to Verrant about other.. potential illusions.<P>Just my 2 cents.<P>Morgan.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Two things. First, a recap of a few points that may have been missed:<P>Verant currently restricts Bear and Spectre form to Shaman and Necros respectively.<P>Absor has mentioned he personally thinks this is to allow them a unique appearance to set them apart a bit from the enchanter (not above, apart).<P>Despite his personal feelings Absor *WILL STILL BRING THESE REQUESTS TO THE DESIGN TEAM*.<P>Further, Absor has been in full support of more illusions for Enchanters that are unique to them, rather then give them Bear and Spectre.  He has even mentioned on other threads where illusion type effects were asked for that he felt enchanters were up for that first.<P>Currently, as far as he knew, the old graphics card limit is still in effect for more illusions.  They have been able to squeeze some in before however, and maybe they will again.<P>Second thing:<P>For a while, enchanters have asked for group illusions.  <BR>Notably, group illusion Werewolf.  <P>Velious gave Enchanters a targetable illusion werewolf.<P>Some Enchanters then complained that being able to turn others into werwolves made enchanters less unique.<P>Now some enchanters are asking for more group illusions.<P>You folks might want to talk amonst yourselves and see which you really prefer.<P>Mike</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think what finally did it for me was the explanation from Absor (I believe) that bears were *added* to the global file to give shamans/druids their new spells.<P>Since Kunark came out, there has been no room in the global file for any new illusions (or so the answer has been).  Since then, they've added at least two new images to the global file (spectre and bear) all the while saying that Enchanters can't get new spells because there's no room in the global file.<P>Verant, please *make* some room for post 44 illusions.  Take some creatures that are common to multiple zones (aviaks, orcs, gnolls, kobolds, shadowmen) and *put* them in the global files so we can have them.<P>Please stop with the 'no room' excuse.  It's getting old and tired and totally un-believable considering that you clearly can make room for other classes.<P>The easiest answer, of course, would be to give spectre and bear to the enchanter simply because you can't use the 'no room' excuse on those.  Instead we get all new different excuses about polygons and such.<P>SG</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I was so irritated when I saw the new velious spells I have given up on leveling my enchanter completely.  Here's a suggestion if you won't give enchanters anything that supports their illusionist title...then give them a title more fitting what you're making them into like Grand Mana Battery.  It's obvious to me verant doesn't want to go to any "trouble" to make the enchanter class any more unique or useful.  <P>At 50th I awaited Velious praying as well for verant interactive to give me something decent since my post 50 spells looked like the same darn spells I had before just more mana costly.  After running around looking I found that lower level spell "gift of magic".  I was floored cause I couldn't figure out what it did at first.. and when I did...Damn was I mad...great now i can give some one else more mana...god that's what I wanted for christmas.<P>After all the hype I find out that the illusion ww was single target and at most can be given to 2 maybe 3 party members...great...and being a 44th level MOB DROP spell I was again irritated out of my mind...goody <P>You want ideas verant here you go....<P>Group Illusions for every one of our spells that give the EXACT same faction and bonuses that we get...yep that's for starters.<P>Hey why not this for a no brainer...Improve the old ones...omg it's revolutionary isn't it.  You've already given us abilities so our illusions are not truly illusions...If you don't think they should have bonuses well darn well take them all off and make them what they should be.  If you don't wish to have illusions get bonuses then make it so religion and give base faction with no modifications to it.  <P>Do these situations make any sense at all read below.<P>An enchanter cleverly casts Illusion human  and walks into town only to die because she had "Innoruk Rulez!!!!" still tatood on her arm.<P>A corrupt queynos guard says "Y'know bob...that human over there really looks like that dark elf that was killing off our brothers in arms last week."<P>Ok I'm done but guess what my enchanter is shelved and i'm fiddling around with a mage...they actually seem to get improvements and I can actually solo with him.<P>Unomee Donchoo 50th enchantress and mana battery it would seem</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've been playing since beta2.  I've brought well over 500 people to EQ through my occupation and other hobbies.  EQ was what I'd been waiting for my whole life.  D&D with visuals!  With Kunark and Velious the visuals have become breathtaking.  <P>It seems that with better graphics come horrible policies and environment changes.  The community of people in EQ are in large a mindless majority that wouldn't role-play with dice if they COULD read a Dungeon Masters Guide.  This, I believe, is because VI has reversed the attribute of EQ that made it stand out originally; it's not easy, you have to think.  This has brought a different class of gamers our way.  <P>“Newbie: HEY!  I want to change form that’s cool..   but Enchanters are too hard to play!  Why can’t my druid do it?!?”<P>“Verant customer service on phone:  DEV TEAM?!?  We have an equality issue.  The Norrathian NAACP may picket!  Change it all!”<P>I've been handling it though, I've continued to role-play in a sea of people who belong on a Quake3 server.<P>Last Straw:  My Enchanter is no longer Enchanting to me.  There is nothing mystical about him.  As he grows older he becomes LESS capable.  More powerful by contrast, but not by effect.  Today’s EQ is reminiscent of our Public Education system; bring the bright kids down, the challenged children up, and let them meet at a middle ground so no one will feel LEFT OUT.  Everyone gets their warm fuzzy feeling for forcing equality (listen to “The Trees”, by the band Rush).  Enchanters are a challenge to play, if others can’t manage to play the class, so be it if they can’t jewel craft or change form.<P>I don’t like the direction VI is taking this, and don’t appreciate the lies to the enchanter community.  Betrayal is the correct word Verant, no matter how politically incorrect you feel it is.  You have stopped caring what the people loyal to you think, and considered marketing strategies to increase your player base.  It will backfire.<P>My three accounts and any people I may have referred to you in the future are canceled.  The loss of one person will not be a problem for you, but trust me, I will be one of many. <P>Ninety-nine percent of the failures come from people who have the habit of making excuses<BR>--George Washington<P>Honesty is for the most part less profitable than <BR>dishonesty.  <BR>--Plato <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Reading this continued thread I am reminded of that most basic fact of communications... perception is everything.  Whether you really intended to betray players expectations or not is immaterial... whether players see The Vision (tm) or not is unimportant... what IS important is that a significant number of intelligent, thoughtful, and normally supportive players are very angry about the boilerplate responses of late to this thread.<P>Absor... a word of advice for you... take it or leave it as you wish.  Don't get up here and tell people why they are wrong... instead hear what they are saying, and take that information back into the development team.  In the final analysis, you may elect not to do anything to please the angry elements in question... but telling them why they are wrong and why they shouldn't feel betrayed is... well... silly.<P>Frankly, I think the original post, though perhaps overly emotional, is still correct.  An opportunity for a significant amount of fun was overlooked... and that same specific fun factor (which used to be exclusively a property of the enchanter class) was distributed to others (Shaman, Mage).  So, while diffusing the fun toy that enchanters got that helped make them feel unique, their own pleas for more illusions (which are some of the most innocuous requests you've seen up here, unlike melee binding and the like) have been utterly ignored... and when brought up here, generated a semantics game to dodge the basic issue.<P>I'm disappointed in Absor and VI on this issue... which is becoming a sadly common state of affairs.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OTHER POTENTIAL ILLUSIONS<P>If we are moving on with the discussion of other potential illusions I think I have a few ideas.<P>Currently Enchanters can turn into Any playable race, any elemental, two skeletons, a tree, and a werewolf. Most of the more intelligent races are playable until Velious came out. <P>What about the following Illusions:<P>Illusion Drake<BR>Used for Dragon areas, to keep it unballancing it would probably have very little faction adjustment, sorta like Illusion Iksar in Cabilis. <P>Illusion Giant<BR>Not going to happen but again, another intelligent race with a bank and all.<P>Illusion Coldain<BR>I think we are begining to see a pattern here.<P>Illusion Froglok<BR>Many enchanters have asked for this one.<P>Illusion Spider<BR>Don't know what use this one would have, I'd probably get squished if I was using it. <P>Illusion Gender<BR>Someone said something about Gender affecting reaction? This doesn't make any sense to me unless we are talking about reaction other players have. This would be a fun illusion but nothing more. <P>Illusion Target<BR>This one has already been dismissed, but it would be fun and useful. <P>Illusion Bear<BR>I don't see any reason not to give this to enchanters, It makes a lot more sense not to give us spectre than bear, although I could make a point for spectre as well. <P>Illusion - Major<BR>Perhaps the ability to turn into larger man made objects. This would be mostly for fun. Things like Docks, Houses, Bridges, Spires. Perhaps a list to choose from when we cast?<P><BR>I was disappointed to hear that 2 other classes were getting illusion type spells especially after all we heard before about why certian illusions were not being granted. Hopefully we can move on to the more important issue of these new illusions.<P><BR>One final thing that might be really interesting what if the illusions had a negative aspect to them? Bind Sight for example drains Stamina and Minor Illusion and Tree remove SOW. Perhaps Illusions that were considered very powerful would have continual mana drain or stamina drain or hitpoint drain. Something that requries intense concentration of the Enchanter but keeps him alive for the short time that the enemy is near?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

We will not be getting anymore illusions... with the possibility of gender or some other such nonesense.<P>I am also heartened that VI has made many creatures in Velios extremely resistant to the enchater mainstay.  <P>IMHO VI nerfed the heck out of 'chanters with the introduction of Velios.  Was it intentional?  More than likely not as Verant has some of the worst QA in the gaming industry.  If that offends you sorry.  It also could be that the creatures are set up intentionally that way.  I have no clue.  I would like to believe VI was attempting some cool new spiffiness and they just failed to consider the implications.<P>I hope VI takes a look at the policies they are using to slam the best class in the game (IMHO - I like 'chanters).  <P>Absor, I am sorry if you don't like this bit of my opinion.  No offense to you in any regard.  After all you are doing your job and I am sure you are doing admirably at VI.

</FONT><HR>No Alan, you haven't.<P>Explain this:  With the knowledge that VI couldn't add more illusions due to restrictions of the original system requirements, why did you give the last few remaining models (including spectre which you've previously said wasn't possible) to other classes?  You said in your post that you know a lot of people won't be happy about the fact that Enchanters won't have new illusions.  We've been disappointed in the past, it's nothing new, it's been going on since beta.  What's different this time is that you've given the ability to other classes at the height of our disappointment.  Acknowledge the fact that other classes were given ILLUSIONS at the same point that it would be apparent to Enchanters that there would be none available to us in the future.<P>HOW ABOUT THIS?!<BR>"This action was not thought out with the Enchanter community in mind, and for that we apologize.  I think however, that you'll be pleased with the enhancements we make to the Enchanter class in the future.  We're working on it."<P>That's not going to happen though.  Enhancements go to areas that might create revenue, such as making the game easier for the market you haven't captured yet.

</FONT><HR>To me this seems just plain childish whining.. class uniqueness? When has this problem become serious enough to warrant new spells and spell tweaks? I play a necro. Happily. I don't whine and moan when we get nerfed, because it's a class I enjoy. I don't even solo that much- why play an online game to solo? I enjoy being a necromancer for RP value and for tha sheer coolness of the spells. Now tell me one Necro ability that isn't duplicated in many other classes? Our defining qualities, DOTs, pets, and fear, are done elsewhere, and for the most part, done better. Shamans can DOT better than us at several points in our career, and we only narrowly edge them out in later levels. Mages, enchanters, shamen, and to some extent wizards, clerics, and druids all get pets. Ours only beat the mage pets by a narrow margin. And fear? Enchanters and Clerics do it just as well. But when was the last time you saw a Necromancer throw a fit about "class uniqueness"? Be grateful that Enchanters have what they have- what other class is as sought after for raids? When was the last time you saw a shout: "RAID FORMING, DESPERATELY NEED NECRO TO DOT NAGGY"? <P>In short, quit *****ing.<P>Just my 2 cp.        <BR>                   -A Satisfied Necromancer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I rather suspect their code IS object-oriented. However, some code is just not that easily swapped out. Consider the following scenario, which is completely HYPOTHETICAL and, although it represents the actual effect seen in-game, probably bears no relationship to the actual code.<P>Let's say that all reaction code is inside the monsters. Reason: Players choose their own reactions to monsters and players, so its really part of NPC AI. Now, we know that reaction is based on race, religion, and history with a faction. Let's suppose that each monster has a list of reaction modifiers applied to the first two. A sample: a sarnak recruit in the Lake of Ill Omen. Let's say it is -1000 (used to represent KOS) to all PC races and also to goblins and 0(neutral) to everything else. Thus it attacks all PCs and goblins it sees, and ignores all other NPCs. (I've never seen a Sarnak fight an Iksar NPC, but either I may have just never seen the circumstance, or NPC iksar may be a seperate race). Just for the heck of it, it could also be +100 to worshippers of Cazic-Thule and -100 to everyone else. Now, this information is all in the monster object, not the player object. Illusions work (in this scenario) by temporarily changing the race of the character, and thus whenever monsters "query" the race, they get the new value and react to it. In addition, race is probably bound somehow to how the character looks. I.e. you can't just have a "General Race" that looks like a bunch of different stuff depending on circumstance. Absor stated special coding was required to make the two undead illusions. The special coding was probably to make two races (or maybe one if they look exactly the same) just for the illusions, and include reaction variables for monsters for them. The reason you couldn't (in this scenario) make a copycat illusion that didn't alter faction is because to change the way a character is displayed, you'd have to change its race, and now all NPCs would treat it as that race. Thus no Sarnak would attack someone changed to a Sarnak by a spell, because Sarnak don't kill each other. You couldn't work around this by adding new "illusion races" like for the Drybone illusion because you'd have to have an extra illusionary race for every single real race, and even then it would be unclear as to how to get the illusionary race from the value of the copied monster's race. Also, in this case, I can't conceive of a change to only one object that would fix the problem. Actually, you COULD do it by changing the player object... but it would require adding variables for storage of temporary values for race. In this case you could change the client code so the graphic used to display the player was the "apparent" race value, while reaction code continued to use the "real" race. Then Illusion:Copycat could make it you an "apparent" Sarnak (that is, displayed as a Sarnak) without making you a "real" Sarnak (to the reaction code, you are still a human/elf/gnome/erudite/whatever). The problem with this scenario is.... Abashi already said (in regards to keeping track of whether people had already completed a quest) that they CANNOT add new variables to the player code without doing a player wipe. So if they don't have the variable free, and can't add it, they can't do this. I can't really think of any other way to have racial faction modifiers, and display tied to race, and have a copycat illusion under this THEORETICAL construct. So in this sample case, even with well organized object-based code, you are faced with a change you can't make without wiping the player population, something roughly equivalent to dynamiting all the server machines as far as the game goes  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">. It's a shame, actually, that they CAN'T add new variables over the run of the game, because here and especially in quests and in LORE drops there are some variables they really COULD use.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Truth is the weapon you wield.<P>Truth 1. you as the consumer have total power in this game.<P>truth 2. If you do not like what is happeneing in the game you can, by canceling your account, bend Verant or Sony to your will.<P>Truth 3. If enough Enchanters Said change it or I cancel my account on January 1, 2001 (and mean't it) They would change the game to whatever you wished whether it met their view of Norrath or not.  If enough Monks said give me teleportation abilities or I cancel my account, Verant would make the change.  Sure they would explain it away by saying you've gained the ability to trans meditate your self away.  It does not matter how they explain it away they would make the change because it is the dollar that drives this game and the dollar they would bend to. The dollar they make today that lets them pay for programmers to make Everquest 2 and Star Wars, so they can make more dollars.<P>Truth 4. If you are not willing to go to those extremes then you do not really want the changes that badly so let it drop.  Make your requests all you want it will not change their stance on what they want, and what they see the game to be (regardless of your begging, pleading or questioning, as long as the power goes unchecked they are in the drivers seat, and your just along for the ride)<P>You could put it this way "Enchanters of Norrath UNITE you have nothing to lose but your illusions."<P>I play an enchnater on Quellious I hate the way our class has been neutered.  A group oriented class that has been made obsolete.  A class given the distinction Illusionist where the only illusion is that we still count on Verant to be fair and just and take our requests seriously.  Instead of reading them and laughing at what we the mere people paying their paychecks would like. Talking with many of my friends they are beginning to think it is a waste of time.  Reading these discussions it seems that way as well.<BR> <BR>I will wait a little longer to see if any sort of effort will be made to satisfy those that are upset.  Rather than give more excuses.  Excuses that are refuted by their own words constantly. <P>Truth 5.

</FONT><HR>You know it's ironic. Enchanters never really complain. You don't see them whining over mana, hp, pets, etc. often. (yeah there are some that do there always will be) But as a genral rule very little. Then we ask for something that is more for fun than to alter gameplay and we can't even get that. I just find it curious. Personally I don't agree with the whole idea for enchanters. I think that if you want a crowd control, illusion class it should be call illusionists, or charmers. I always though enchanters made magical items or enchanted current items. However that's not they way things are. The fact is we are there for crowed control, mana, and illusions (look at the post 50 titles if you don't get it yet) I just think most enchanters feel like we aren't needed for these purposes anymore.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
