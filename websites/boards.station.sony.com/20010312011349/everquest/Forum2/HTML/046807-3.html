</FONT><HR>Lyrical,<P>It is funny. You make the argument (paraphrased)<P>"If they can't hear bards on test for a week, how are they going to hear us here?"<P>Easy they are not.  There is no need to listen to bards here.  They have already told you that it has been fixed and will be implemented in the NEXT patch.  No amount of discourse with you is going to change that.  You are not going to convince them that it is more severe than already perceived because it is not.<P>As someone else said there are other fixes that need to be implemented from the last patch.  It makes no sense to do a patch for one fix, especially if they are still working on others that need to go in as well.<P>Unfortunately Bards get more than their fair share of "breaks" when it comes to patches.  It is almost comical how bard's seem to get something broken in a large majority of patches.  However this has to do more with the unique nature of the Bard class than any kind of Verant vendetta.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I don't care what group I get in, I can make a difference in the groups performance outside of feeding mana to the casters.<P>In fact, the only time I just play manasong is when I am in a caster heavy group, or my hand hurts from hours of twisting in Hate, Sebilis, etc.<P>As far as Selo's goes, last night in Fear was a perfect example.  We were pulling the temple to get to Cazic and some of us were kiting the Amygdalans and other mobs around while the camp picked them off one by one.  I had to rely on SoW, which is now faster than Selo's, contrary to what Absor stated.  Because of this, I could not distance myself from the Summoning mobs quickly enough and died a few times as a result, hey it's Fear, I expect to die a lot, and I did.  We didn't get to Cazic (pathing problems with dracoliche caused us to waste a lot of time), but in the end, we just couldn't kite the Temple mobs long enough and base camp by the fright finger house was trained a few times as a result.<P>Now, tell me this is just an inconvience.<P>I know that Absor is being fed a line of crap from the programmers/testers, and I feel bad for him cause he is taking the heat for it.<P>Absor:  You need to get on their butts about this issue, I know it's not your fault, but those guys make you look bad.<P>I said it earlier I'll say it again.  Selo's with a drum is well more than twice the speed of SoW.  If druids SoW speed increase was cut in half (which would SUCK), I guarandamntee you that it would have been patched within an hour.  <P>The biggest problems I have is that one, this bug has been known and reported for WEEKS!!!!!!<P>Second, In a matter of hours after the servers came back up and the whining began (yes I was a whiner too), you said that the problem was already identified and the code was ready for the next patch.  ***?!?  Why not just say hey, lets bump the patch back a day so we can get it right the first time instead of following the typical policy of, oh, lets just do it and &lt;insert class here&gt; can suffer till we feel like doing another patch.<P>I'm ranting now, but it's directed at you Absor, your just the guy stuck taking the heat.<P>Zurin Cosmosis<BR>52 bard forever<BR>Officer of Last Hope<BR>Proud wielder of absolutely nothing.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

This is a minor inconvenience, as agreed to by a number of bards and stated by Verant.  It does not warrant shutting the servers down for 10 hours, when another patch is imminent due to the other bugs.<P>In any event, knowing what the song does is irrelevant to disagreeing with the childish behaviour you and others have demonstrated.  The bug could have made you unable to sing a single song, and it still would not have justified your activities.

</FONT><HR>Phelan, you just proved your ignorance of the class.  As Lyrical is a good, high level bard, I am sure he plays the game with his instruments equipped more often than weapons or anything else.  When I see my bard with weapons in hand, I think it kind of looks funny, as I am used to seeing him with a drum or lute equipped.  So, by saying the song works fine, you just can't enhance it, you are so dead wrong, you made me laugh for the last 5 minutes.  The song is completely broken, for I never use it without a durm, in fact I was still equipping a drum last night even tho I knew it was broken.<P>I noticed someone pointed out fear.  I have always been the temple trainer for my guild because I am the only person that can distance myself from mobs and move them correctly with my speed while healing myself at the same time to allow quick destruction of the temple.  Without my drums working for Selo's, I would probably die 10 times even making the attempt when I usually die at most once.<P>The song is severely broken, not just crippled a little.  Bard speed is relied on by any good raiding party, and I am sorry you haven't been with a good raid.  The thing that is most bothersome is the fact that Verant breaks the class a lot when changing spells and never listens to people on test about problems that come up.  They let them go live then let bards complain about them for 2-3 months and then decide to stop toying and fix the issue.  So please stop trolling these threads while you still think that Selo's is just a glorified sow, because it is nothing of the sort for any bard that understands how to play his/her class to their fullest extent.<P>Dolphin Oceansinger</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think the combat and soloing aspects have been well described here - it isn't if you can run away, it is how fast you can get away, especially if you start out in bash range.<P>Plus I know I use some solo tactics that involve running backwards -that would get me pasted at SoW speed.<P>However, Selo's is how I keep my travel down time to levels that I can stand.  Without it, my bard will not be travelling much at all in the near future.<P>Do I think the servers should come down right now for an emergency patch? Not really.<P>For me, waiting a week for a patch would be fine. If we are without this ability for much more than that - especially if it gets to a month - my respect for Verant will plummet.<P>I am also curious to see if a DD-breaks-snare buff bug will warrant an emergency patch.  Since this bug only seems to happen when you have root+snare, and since root+snare wasn't possible until this patch, I don't see how that would warrant an emergency fix if Selo's didn't.<P>Mike</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It does not warrant shutting the servers down for 10 hours, when another patch is imminent due to the other bugs.<BR>In any event, knowing what the song does is irrelevant to disagreeing with the childish behaviour you and others have demonstrated.

Or your spells only do 20% of what damage they used to do.

</FONT><HR>So what you are telling me is that if SoW all of a sudden was only working at 10% of the normal speed increase, you would be happy with it to wait for a week or two to be fixed because it still works???  What I am saying is no drum = no song, as Olaaf so simply pointed out.  I use Selo's more than 50% of my time online, and use it without a drum about 0.5% of the time I play it.  So you just ruined about 50% of the game for me and ruined it for a couple weeks.  I have been watching your trolling in other threads and you have brought me to the conclusion that you do not understand the mechanics of bards, as most people don't.  I usually don't condemn people for it, I simply point out their errors, as many bards here have done for you, yet you refuse to understand.  No, the song does not work without drums, simple enough.  It is our number 1 defense while traveling, much like the buffs, roots, and gating abilities of other classes.<P>Dolphin Oceansinger</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Personally, when one death carries the risk of lossing days of effort and exp. you don't even really feel like logging on. A key tool you use to save your neck and the neck of your group is not working. Playing up to lvl 51+ you learn to rely on your skills, and when one key element in those skills is questionable, you loss a step and then you and your team may die. Bards don't just use this song to get thru a zone fast. We use it to pull, we use it for CC, we use it soloing, and we use it for evac. There is a reason every bard from as soon as they get acel. until when they stop playing the game keep this song memmed. It's just that good. By reducing the effectiveness of this song you are not just making us eat up more time getting around, you are reducing or effectiveness when we get to where we are going. Do we want to make the whole EQ community suffer from doing a patch. No. But, in the long run they will be suffering. Because the bards they team with will not be as effective and with each day this fix is not put into the game the disatisfaction of the bards grows. You won't loss all bards over this but you will loss a number of them. There are too few good ones to risk lossing any. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1158:<P>The fear part wasn't meant about the group balance issue, that was just to point out that the selo's bug was more than an inconvience:  to answer your questions<P>what songs do you use when on a team with:<BR>a) enchanter<BR>b) enchanter and shamman<BR>c) enchanter, shamman, and druid<P>A lot of this depends on where I am fighting.  But for the average pickup group in say, Karnors Castle (gawd i hate that place) where adds can be numerous.<P>a) enchanter.  lots of adds typically in karnors, so i leave the messing up to the enchanter.  I play Verses of Victory (haste eats up a chanters mana), Niv's (regen + str), and the level 51 slow/snare song.  Keep in mind that my charm is always ready.  <P>b) With a chanter and shaman (or necro) i definately twist the cantana for regen and mana, and i discuss with them what they want to do.  Shamans are typically the best at slowing, so I nix that.  If they don't want to haste, I take care of that and maybe twist a Tuyen's chant in there (136 dmg over 9 seconds with Nostrolo's tamborine with a 210 percussion skill) which makes a pretty decent combo.  Also instead of the dot i might throw in a snare unless we have a ranger or melee with a snare proccing weapon.<P>c)Enchanter, Shaman, and Druid.  Now we are starting to get caster heavy.  Twist in the cantana for mana and regen, again i will haste (if the shaman or chanter throws aug its ok cause they stack) and maybe Nillipus's march of the wee for the agi bonus.<P>In all of these situations when my chanter is trying to get a mob mezzed and gets knocked to half life, that mob is getting charmed.  Yeah, it might waste some mana, but I would rather have the chanter alive to mez it off me wearing plate mail than to die.<P>The socials hotkeys work great here ie, /g I am charming a %T.  /cast 8.<P><BR>These are just some examples off the top of my head.<P>Also understand that I do not do a whole lot of grouping outside of my guild, so i know who is doing what and what my job needs to be, which makes it a lot easier.<P><BR>I wasn't meaning to flame you or anything, its just that being a mana battery is a common misconception about bards.<P>Hell, Ihave gone into howling Stones as *the* enchanter and we crawled all the way through virtually unscathed.  Bard CC is great in groups because typically the mezzes/charms don't need to last all that long in because the mobs drop quickly.<P>There are a lot more combos than this that can be used, but like i said, that is what i find myself doing the most of sim[ply because that's the style of play that me and my guildies use.<P>Good luck to ya!<P>Zurin Cosmosis<BR>52 bard forever trying to find his home in the Plane of Mischief.<P>There must be a sign somewhere ....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Juts to be fair, why dont we nerf ShadowKnight MOB's Harm Touch.<P>After all, such a temporary removing of an ability would only be an inconvience, dont you agree?<P>Too bad, if those same SK mobs somehow had their HT nerfed, that there would be an emergency patch within the hour to fix it.<P>Wouldn't it be great if players got the same treatment?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A question back to Alan.  I know this is low in the thread and has a huge pile of flaming ... um, flames, above it, but I just got here.<P>"Does fixing a bug that affects two songs warrant taking the servers down for several hours for our entire customer base?"<P>Depends on if that's true or not.  I assume the two songs you are referring to are Selo's Accelerando and Selo's Song of Travel.  But there are a lot of other songs that get enhanced by Percussion instruments, too, most notably the three Chant DoTs.<P>Do we know for a fact (and by "we" I mean "you") that all other Percussion-based songs are not equally hampered by this bug?  It's hard for us in the Bard community to know this, as we don't numerically see how much damage our DoTs do.  So I'm depending on you, Alan, to ask the people who _can_ see these numbers whether other songs have been affected or not.<P>If only the Selo's songs are affected, fine, I guess I'll go play one of my alternate characters until the next patch.  But if it is all Percussion songs, then we need an emergency patch ASAP!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OMG phelan.<BR>You know how many 55+ bards solo?<BR>None. Its not feasable at 55+ selos or no selos.<BR>Thats more for the 27-54 crowd.<BR>Its going to impact them the most. (Not to mention the PvP folks)<P>For the 55+ crowd it will affect pulling and hate list manipulation mainly.<P>Its plainly clear you know as much about bards as ABsor and verant does. They think its minor.<BR>Try telling that to a PoG or PoF pulling bard.<BR>Or bards pulling in traks teeth.<BR>Or to the soloing 27-54 bunch. Or the PvP.<BR>It affects so much that you all think is 'minor'.<P>Just because fellow bards tell me to shut up once in a while doesnt mean what Im saying isnt still valid. I've never been accused of not knowing what im talking about when it comes to bards, just emphasizing it too much.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
