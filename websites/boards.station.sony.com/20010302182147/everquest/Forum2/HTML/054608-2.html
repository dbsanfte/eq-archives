&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I have been partnered with a Druid for almost 50 levels on and off.<P>I can break and hold down rooms like the Assassin / Supplier room in Lower Guk by myself, thanks to the seconds to cast that my pet buys me and root-park / DOT spacing tactics and slows.  He is amazed and claims that he would run out of mana and die trying to get them all down, but my furry DOT keeps working even when my Mana is getting low.  I have a clear advantage here, I admit that freely.  When we want HQ Bear Pelts, he tracks, my pet kills and we can clear West Karana of wandering trash without ever having to stop to med.<P>He starts soloing almost any mob 3 to 5 levels before I could even try it.  His ability to snare and his Harmony powers allow him to access many camps (such as the Brownies in Fay) that I could never touch, assuming I could even just 'poof' drop everything and get to Fay in less than an hour of dodging guards in KOS towns and waiting on boats.  He has the clear advantage here, both in power and mobility.<P>He tanked guards in the Karanas for 15 levels thanks to his damage shield and unresistable DoTs and Harmony-pulls, I never could since they resisted most of my spells, I couldn't split them and they and hit *far* harder than I did, so paradoxically, my Ogre has better faction in Qeynos than his Halfling...<P>'Poof' now he ports off to Cobalt Scar to kill Wyverns or Bulthars (he doesn't *like* quad-kiting).  I trundle off to see if Cyndreela, who is already green to him, is camped.  It will take me the same time to get to this camp that is just across zone from my *starting city* as it takes him to get to his camp in Cobalt Scar, 11 zones and a boat ride from Rivervale.  By the time I am past the Spectres and summoning a pet, he is already full mana from the teleport cost and good to go.<P>If Cyndreela is camped?  I have to leave and see if anything is open in Lower Guk.  If lots of Druids are running around Cobalt Scar and nothing is free?  In the time it takes me to run through Feerrott, Innothule and Upper Guk, he has already killed his second Brownie Guard and working on his master Baking in the downtime between spawns (which lacking Foraging, I will never be able to learn except by his generosity in handing me scraps).<P>Brownies are camped?  Poof, he is in Skyfire root-dotting Mature Wurms in the time it takes me to get to the Raster / Mino Elder area.  I stick my head in the pit on the way by to see if the Elder is up while he checks Track and sorts mobs in a couple hundred yards by what will give him the best exp and loot.<P>So, to hold greenie camps and farm gear for your twinks, go with the Shaman.  You'll end up doing it anyway, since after 50th, our upgrade spells are rarer and worth more platinum than a Cloak of Flames off of Nagafen, so there is really not much reason to ever go beyond 51st level, other than to stick spells on bigger mobs.  But look, all the new Velious mobs are uber-resistant, so really, there is no reason at all to gain levels to try futily to stick a spell to them.  I guess we were meant to stick to Kunark and never go to the new expansion.<P>To get experience, know instantly if a named mob is up and be able to race over and get the loot  and / or fly through the levels with your choice of a dozen instantly accessible zones (some of which non-teleporters have no real chance of getting to or adventuring in within a single evening) and spawns that practically require Harmony to break and are considered to be 'druid camps' (like the Millers, Chief Goonda or the Brownies), play a Druid.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hmm.this is gonna make me unpopular with some...<P>OK, I wanna suggest a new look at the whole class balance issue.  There is a statement you hear over and over..."We dont want to cut into the role of X as primary X (cleric = healer, warrior = tank, etc).  I want to reconsider this issue.<P>1) It has been amply stated that at high levels, clerics and warriors (and in non-vel zones, enchanters) are assured a place in every group and that the other slots are fought over by the remaining classes.<P>2) People are spending a lot of time trying to make minor adjustments to the other classes to make them useful enough to be considered as group members,..BUT THEY ARE OPERATING FROM THE ASSUMPTION THAT THEY SHOULD NOT DISPLACE ANY OF THE CORE (WARRIOR, CLERIC, ENCHANTER) MEMBERS.<P>I believe this approach is in error.  If true class balance were to occur, a group would need to be made up of healers, tanks and casters.  BUT Rangers and Paladins should be able to fill in for warriors, perhaps at lesser efficiency..with rangers doing more damage, but tanking less well (but NOT so much less well that an increase in healing could not compensate), or paladins tanking as well, but doing less damage (but not so much less that a caster couldnt compensate with nukes or dots).  Or the shamans and druids could fill in for the cleric, with INCREASED DOWNTIME, but NOT a complete inability of the group to operate.  <P>In other words...WHY ARE THE CLERICS AND WARRIORS ROLE IN A GROUP CONSIDERED TO BE SACRED AND UNREPLACABLE?  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hmm….this is going to make me unpopular with some...<P>I would like to propose that certain ‘sacred cows’ of class balance be reconsidered.  There is a statement you hear over and over..."We don’t want to cut into the role of X as primary X (cleric = healer, warrior = tank, etc).  I want to reconsider this issue.<P>1)	It has been amply stated that at high levels, clerics and warriors (and in non-Velious zones, enchanters) are assured a place in every group and that the other slots are fought over by the remaining classes.  The perception that is created is that The Vision™ only has a place for clerics and warriors at the high levels, and the other classes were just added as an afterthought to pacify those who found the ‘true classes’ too restrictive.<BR>2)	A lot of time is being put into discussing minor adjustments to the other classes, so as to make them useful enough to be considered for groups,..BUT THEY ARE OPERATING FROM THE ASSUMPTION THAT THESE CHANGES SHOULD NOT ALLOW THEM TO DISPLACE ANY OF THE CORE (WARRIOR, CLERIC, ENCHANTER) MEMBERS.  The operating assumption here is that warriors and clerics are guaranteed a place in a group, but that the other classes are optional and can be dispensed with.<P>I believe this approach is in error.  If true class balance were to occur, a group would need to be made up of healers, tanks and casters.  BUT Rangers and Paladins should be able to fill in for warriors, perhaps at lesser efficiency (with rangers maybe doing more damage, but tanking less well or paladins tanking as well, but doing less damage).  Or the shamans and druids could fill in for the cleric, with INCREASED DOWNTIME, but NOT a complete inability of the group to operate.  This reduced efficiency SHOULD be able to be compensated for by a good group (as is true at lower levels). <P>In other words...WHY ARE THE CLERICS AND WARRIORS ROLE IN A GROUP CONSIDERED TO BE SACRED AND UNREPLACABLE?  <P><BR>The obvious (knee-jerk) response is...We don’t want to cut down on their usefulness to a group.<P>But this response only makes sense if there is something special about clerics and warriors that makes them MORE DESERVING of being in a group (aside from the skills they bring to the group).   And I don’t see why that should be so.    YOU CANNOT HAVE A SITUATION WHERE ALL CLASSES ARE EQUALLY DESIRABLE, AS LONG AS YOU HAVE CLASSES WITH A PROTECTED STATUS THAT CANNOT BE REDUCED.   As long as every group must have one of each of a few classes, the remaining classes, BY DEFINITION, must be less desirable to the groups.  To make ALL the classes balanced (and not just the less desirable ones) requires either increasing the abilities of the ‘secondary classes’ (EVEN IF THAT MEANS THEY MAY ECLIPSE THOSE OF THE SACRED CLASSES) or nerfing the core classes (which is neither my intent, nor is it feasible, as the mobs are balanced to groups containing these classes, at their current ability levels).<P><BR>Or, to put it another way..<P>Goal:  Each class should be as close to equally valuable to a large raiding party.  The decision of which class to take (as long as the essential roles of tank, healer and caster are filled) should have MORE to do with HOW WELL THE PLAYER PLAYS HIS CLASS, then with the specific class of healer, tank or caster.<P>Current Situation:  Certain classes are essential (warrior, cleric, enchanter (some areas)), other classes are useful (Shaman, Bard, Rogue) and others have little to add (Necro).  If you need a healer (at high levels), you are VASTLY better off with a cleric played by some barely adequate E-bayer, then you are with two shamans played by the best players to ever play a shaman.  <P>Fix:  Stop ‘protecting’ the status of the essential classes by making sure that the classes with secondary abilities are useless at the highest levels.  Sure…Clerics should always be better healers, but shamans and druids SHOULD be able to do it in a pinch (and a slow heal spell that heals the equivalent of ONE hit by the mob is NOT adequate, and neither is one that significantly reduces the tanks effectiveness (torpor).  Warriors will always be better healers, but Rangers and Paladins SHOULD be able to stand up to the highest level mobs, with the party changing tactics some to compensate (more healing needed or more caster damage needed).  <P>{Ducking and Running for Cover as all the warriors and clerics who are afraid their ‘hard-earned’ guaranteed spots on raids might be threatened start to give chase}<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
