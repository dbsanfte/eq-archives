</FONT><HR>Greetings all,<BR>I read all the previous talks and read most of the replies to this item list. <BR>We all want to have more fun, standing med, gate to home temple, bashing, and so on. We do not need these if we are dying before the tanks do and with most of our mana still intact. <P>What we need is a higher dodge cap, and new and higher defensive skills. It is literally meaningless to dodge 1 in 10 attacks while the mob hits for double 100+. We can use armor and the very best of them, but what good would an armor do if you do not know how to benefit from it to the max? I should be able to cast one more heal on a target before I die when all the mob aggroes on me of a complete heal, or live enough to root and run backwards from the mob, or have the tanks taunt it off me.<P>so here is the item :<P>--------------<BR>ITEM: Defense skills.<P>DESCRIPTION: Higher dodge and defense skills. This, in conjunction with giving the cleric bash, might allow them to get into the fight more often. If so, it seems more appropriate to raise parry than dodge.<P>STATUS: None<BR>----------------<P>WRONG... <BR>it should look like this:<P>ITEM: Defense skills.<P>DESCRIPTION: Higher dodge and defense skills. This may let them live some more seconds and save the day and let continue the FUN.<P>STATUS : is a must, cause these guys either sit and med or stand and die.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Okay, as to the meding while standing idea, I like it but right there is the downside of other classes wanting it.  To promote class balance I would sugest a diciplne with like a 2 hour reuse time.  Over the course of its use say 30 seconds, the cleric regenrates back to full mana, however, they recieve NO information while in this deep contact with their god.  No chat no group no shouts no ooc, perhaps not even information on the life bars of their group members.  The cleric would be usless for these 30 seconds and only a mob hitting you would interupt it.<P>I would think that this would be a fairly balanced sugestion.  After all meditation was supose to orginaly be that way.  So I would think that the teams could figure out some way to impliment it.<P>Zachton Soulstrker<BR>55 Templar of the Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Some thoughts on a few of the items...<P>---<P>Defense skills:  I'm 110% for raising these.  Would rather have a high level dodge than a low level parry.<P>---<P>Aegolism: Please please please please do NOT make this a group buff for a huge amount of mana.  As it is, it takes over 20% of my mana to cast, any more would be horrible.  Why?  Because while it does indeed take a lot of mana currently, I can space out the mana cost of buffing the group by medding in between casts.  Think about it, clerics!  You are going to have to rebuff when it drops - if you are deep in a dungeon with your mana staying at about 60-70% from healing, do you really want to have to spend nearly *all* of that when group aego falls?  This would not only create downtime for the group while they wait for you to med, it creates a dangerous situation if you are attacked by a random wandering mob.  LEARN TO SPACE BUFFS.  You should never have to redo more than one Aego at a time, and you should have the time to med back the mana for the next one by the time it falls, so that you never have more than one person unbuffed.<P>Now, as for the Aegolism spell itself, I personally was disappointed with it and would like to see it give more hp/ac than it currently does.  It's not an upgrade - and I think that clerics are due for a real upgrade to their buff line at level 60, as opposed to an all in one what we already did buff.<P>Please don't make this a group buff for 2000 mana.<BR>/begs<P>---<P>Shield of Words:  Absor, this spell only follows the pattern of the spell line in an artificial sense.  Let's say that you go to the store and buy 6 books.  They cost you $120.  Then you decide you want to get 6 more.  The price for 12 books is $240, double the original.  Great.  Now you want to get 18 books.  Following the pattern, the cost for 6 more books is double - $480.  Hrm.  That doesn't seem right, does it?  If we only get 6 books they are $20 each, but if we get 18 they are over $26 each.  Are those extra 6 books really good enough to warrant that?<P>The problem here is not the mana cost itself, it is the mana spent per minute of duration per ac point gained.  Armor of Faith takes .09 mana/minute/ac, if you extrapolate it.  Shield of words is .13 mana/minute/ac - that's a HUGE difference.  Bulwark of faith is a little better, .11 - but clerics don't really get another mana efficient ac buff until Aegis, at .08 mana/minute/ac.<P>Shield of words is a mana hog; the few extra ac you get are not worth the inflated cost.  I consistently used Armor of Faith even though I had SoW.  Likewise, I never cast Bulwark of Faith, using Aegis exclusively.<P>---<P>Mark of Karn:  Along with the pet, this falls into the category of spells that I don't bother casting anymore because they aren't worth the mana cost.  Nor do many (if any) other clerics I know cast them.  I think that says something.<P>---<P>Heroic Bond:  When cast by the same cleric, this spell DOES overwrite itself, but will not overwrite Heroism.  A level 60 cleric will be able to overwrite a level 59 cleric's Heroism/Heroic Bond, but the reverse is not true.  Personally, before I got Aego, if someone joined the group late they got Fortitude - which *is* overwritten, since it has insignificantly less hp/ac than Heroism.<P>---<P>Fortitude:  I kinda like Fortitude, but only for the reason that I just mentioned above.  It is only mana efficient in a group situation for the late comer, or if your group consists of two people.  It's great to cast on someone who doesn't have a cleric in their group or who is solo.  If the benefits of this spell were upped, then it would replace Heroic Bond.  Clerics, do you really want that?  I wouldn't.<P>---<P>Invisibility: I'd like to see this added to an item.  I think putting it on the Donal's bracer is a great idea.  You gave warriors invis and shrink, why not give us invis?<P>---<P>Clicking off spells: Note that the Armor of Protection line is overwritten by the upper level Talisman line as well, nor does it stack with Yaulp (which is really just silly).<P>---<P>A few people have mentioned a group AC buff, I think this would be a great idea...  but worry that it would cost too much mana.  Personally I think that any spell that takes over 30% of my mana at level 60 is too much.<P><BR>~Morniel Everhate, Teir'dal Cleric of the 60th Circle<BR>Mana Economist</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Giving clerics bash!?  If that goes through, then they better give the Iksar SLAM.  I've been fighting iksar skeletons, marauders, manslayers, etc.  And even the iksar SHAMAN SLAM with their TAILS!  Don't give me this whole large races size thing either.  Barbarian's are medium and large, and still get slam.  It's not a matter of size for the iksar, it's the fact they have a TAIL and all Iksar should be able to USE it.  Make it like slam, or just CALL it slam.  Because it's BLATENTLY obvious fighting a freaking NORMAL skeleton that SLAMS you with it's tail that the iksar were MEANT to have it.  Now they're suggesting giving Cleric's bash, which means they CAN add those abilities after the class is already well integrated.<P>It's not a demand or rant.  I just think that if Clerics now get bash, then fix this age old Iksar issue.  It's not at all hard to see or any more overpowering them Barbarian's having slam.  if you don't have the bash skill, just like any other slamming species, your skill doesn't go up.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, please add something about the Yaulp line.  I had suggested that perhaps the Cleric should get X amount of HP (or mana) back when they attack in melee with this spell on.  Each hit would yield X amount of hit points healed to the Cleric.<P>Also, I think Banishment of Shadows should do two things.  1) Out right kill undead critters level 45 or less like it does now and 2) do MASSIVE damage to undead critters over level 45.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Other people have already adequately dissected Absor's list, so I won't belabor those points.  However, what struck me about Absor's list was what was totally missing -- the imbalance between clerics and the other healing classes prior to level 39 (or at least prior to level 34).  Shaman get SoW at level 9, druids get it at level 14.  Druids then get individual TP at 19 and group TP at 29.  Clerics, on the other hand, don't get anything that really distinguishes them, except for Revive at level 29.  And frankly, no one gets too excited about Revive because it doesn't restore any experience.  The reaction tends to be,"That's all you have?  Hmm, let me look for a level 39 cleric."<P>So let me make a proposal, which would address this problem without having any effect whatsoever on the 50+ game.  In fact, this proposal does not nerf any other class, and in fact would benefit every non-cleric in the game.<P>1. Make Revive a level 19 spell.  That is when druids get TP, so why not give clerics Revive?  This would make clerics more popular in groups, especially dungeon groups.  Because it would be easier to complete CRs in dungeons, it might make some of the underused dungeons more popular, too.  This would be a win-win scenario for everyone in the game, and it would not imbalance clerics.<P>2. Create a new level 29 rez spell that restores 30% experience.  At level 29, druids and shamans get GH, and druids get group TP.  This would give clerics a little something extra to make them more desirable in a group.  Druids and shamans are still rocking at this level, but this would give clerics something that put them in demand.<P>3. Increase the experience restoration of the level 39 spell, Resuscitate, to 60%.  This is really optional, but I like a 30-60-90 progression.  That way, there is more separation from the level 29 spell.<P>4. Leave Resurrection and Revivescence alone.  The level 49 spell stays 90%, and the level 56 spell stays 96%.  Clerics don't need help competing in the 50+ game, as long as we don't get nerfed on what we already have.<P>The only real objection to this proposal would be that there would be less experience loss in the the level 29-39 game.  Compared to the elimination of the class experience penalties, the reduction in experience loss would be trivial.  Furthermore, this proposal would make the game more fun for everyone.  Even the most violently anti-cleric druid dies from time to time.  If a level 22 cleric could give that druid a Revive somewhere out in the boondocks or on the bottom level of a dungeon, the druid won't complain one bit.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I would happily live with only two changes to clerics.<P>1) The defensive is about time.  I have always found it sad that shamans were as good or better than clerics at tanking when we are the plate wearing class.<P>2) Now then for the BIG DADDY of requests.  Make our invuln spells a mem blur also.  We would have a feign death that gave us 10 or 15 seconds to clear the area before it ran out.  When the game came out only clerics had an invuln.  Now pallys and necros have it also.  Make cleric invuln unique again.  A feign death type of spell with a 15 minute recast time is hardly overpowering.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alot of points have allready been made so i'll just point out a few ones that didnt make it and stress the ones that need to be made.<P>#1 MoK, I like the explenation that the other person made about how this benifitis the classes (except warrior) who often dont get Chealed, rangers, monks, and rogues, because of there low HP and high agro. It should be changed back to its original state.<P>#2 self invis... Either REMOVE IT FROM THE WARRIOR ARMOR or GIVE IT TO US! Its down right pathetic and insulting that you guys stuck this in a frekin piece of warrior armor (Its also on the indarcine (spelling may be wrong) breastplate) when  PURE CASTING class dosnt get this. <P>Especialy at higher levels.. at 50+ normal invis is still very much usefull.. invis undead how ever has become very much useLESS! I swear to god the only time ive used invis undead since I kunark came out was to camp for my howling stones key in keasora.. a 20-30 lvl dungion.<P>#3 Caps... its pretty obviuse verrant downright forgot they should have upped MANY caps when kunark and sov came out. Deffense increase is a must, we are after all a plate class, dodge also needs an increase. Parry on the other hand..dosnt that require a sword in one hand? we cant wield swords. Offense.. true we are not a melee class and I dont wanna turn us into a paliden, but I think 1hb/2hb skill should atleast be increased... The damage outpute im not worried about.. its the fact we miss so damn often.<P>#4 the unswirving hammer, ALOT of things need to be checked on it, simply makeing it immune to ae and ripo isnt gona work.. this thing thakes 600 mana! has 90hp... and has a HIGH taunt factor.. <P>5. Gate to ones own temple, I dont really care for this and may find some problems with it, for starters.. if your say..a cazic thule follower.. which temple would you go to, neriak? or Paineel? Also what if your (like me) an erudite cleric? Our city is on an island in the middle of no where, a gate to our city wouldnt put us any closer to most places, worse yet.. if your a cleric from paineel.. you have that one problem of getting PAST erudin city to the docks with NO self invis...<P>6. Ability to med while standing... I kind of like this idea.. and while straigt out ability to med while standing would be imbalencing (One of the burdens of a cleric is the fact he DOES agro sometimes and this makes him unable ot sit without getting pounded). On the other hand if it was made a spell somewhat like LICH is, give it a 10 or 15 second cast time, add a 1 point damage shield component to it, so if the cleric gets hit AT ALL it would wear off, that might be a good idea. the 15 second casting time would make a clr think twice in a fight situation about recasting it. Also if you guys havnt noticed.. where now the only casting class who hasnt gotten some form of self mana regen. (necro lich, enchanter clarity, wizard harvest, mage modrod, druid form of the howler, shaman bear form)<P>7. Group buffs.. We need more of these imo... we are the only class that buffs EVERYONE.. shaman are buffers of melee only, clr buff melee, casters, everyone. There is no doubt WE ARE the master buffers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Great post Alan, <BR>just one thing<P>"ITEM: Healing Over Time.<P>DESCRIPTION: It seems that the healing over time spells do not stack with poisons or diseases (one player also noted that Celestial Healing does not stack with Regrowth). This would seem to be the kind of things that these spells are designed to work against. Is this intentional? Also, if the shadow knight epic weapon proc (Soul Consumption) is on a target, the healing over time spells won’t stick. But if the healing over time spells are on, Soul Consumption will stick. This seems like a bug.<P>STATUS: None"<P>What about necro lich? Originally after the patch to fix stacking issues with regular regens it was stated that the spell would OVERWRITE lich but instead it doesn't hold, do you think you could get it to work as was stated in that patch. Overwrite lich or just plain ol' stack with it. Is it that hard to make a new spell line... I mean it wasn't hard to make donal's bp have its on spell line that stacks with everything(suposedly after nerf).<P>Thanks,<BR>Bamur <BR>Dwarven Templar<BR>Prexus &lt;KTF&gt;<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>STANDING MEDITATION II<P>Well I wanted to post on this, and a few other topics  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Again I'd like to stress that Standing meditation would honestly make me question my faith in Everquest.  I see a weak tie in their gods being on earth, but eventually all gods will be... or so it seems. Strap on them JBoots, Nuke a summoned creature... run run run run (full mana) nuke again and again and again... OOM run run run run run (full mana).  And the cycle continues, thus making clerics the best solo class availible  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  I wish that this would have been omitted from the list and more benificial spells or additions would have been added.  I don't see how it relates to balance or story line.  I think it was just a filler because Clerics didn't have anything else to be put on the list.(?)<P>To the poster of Clerics wanting to be druids.<P>Have you ever seen nature? It grows and heals.  Such as the reason why druids get heals.   Clerics are benifical because their buffs are superior and their heals are superior.  Druids want heals so they might be allowed to get into a group.  Druids are not group friendly, because a shaman can SoW, a Cleric can heal and buff, and a magician can DMG shield.  Druids are pretty much your last resort fellas.   In my opinion Clerics are healers, Clergy men etc.  I didn't understand why they could wear plate in the first place when I bought the game, but never decided to argue it.  I wish verant would make a single post somewhere following this template:<P>Our Vison of the Cleric is...<P>Our Vision of the Druid is...<P>Our vision of the Necromancer is...<P>We keep getting asked to give examples, definitions on why we need this, but we all see the classes in different ways.  I would like to know what The EQ team thinks of each class, with some examples!<P>Just my two and a half coppers.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>If we're going to give clerics standing meditation and justify it as a gift from the gods (despite the fact that most prayer is generally done while KNEELING) then lets give Shamans a cool mana regen based on their real world counterparts. I think that shamans should be able to summon magical mushrooms, gulp 'em down and get instantly drunk. Then, whenever drunk, shamans gain mana back at twice the normal rate. This is just like in the real world, where the shamans used to get really ****ed up on hash or peyote and commune with the spirits.<P>Similarly, druids should be able to gain back mana quicker while having sex with goats and eating babies, just like the real world druids.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I posted this in previous threads which haven't really been read but i'll state it again.<P>One thing I would really like to see is the ability for a cleric to summon a holy symbol for their respective deity it would be no rent/lore/no drop/magic and it would take a lot of mana to cast. It would be good if it had different effects depending on the deity or that we need this symbol to cast certain spells (may be an invis?), I mean if we're so religious and we derive our powers from our god wouldn't it make sense to have a holy symbol?<P>just a small rant<P> -Jaldaeus Faithbringer<BR>lvl 24 Dwarf Cleric ~ Tarew Marr<BR>"My Cleric is My Main!"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Divine Aura needs to be changed so that bemificial spells can still be cast on the cleric while he is invunrable. If the gods granted me this spell to protect me from an untimly death, I'm sure they didnt intend for me to have to watch all of my friends get evaced out leaving me to fight all of the mobs myself because I was "immune" from the evac. I cant remember how many times I have cast this in the nic of time while the mobs keep beating on me, and the secondary healers are all trying desperatly to heal me. I end up cursing this spell as much as I am thankful for it, and am often afraid to cast it, even if I have it up. Why would the gods want to make a spell that makes a cleric that is temporarily invunrable, but doomed to die because none of his friends are able to help him. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ranjer, you are obviusly a noob.. because you know nothing. eq is not as simple as nuke.. run run run run.. nuke.. unless your are a druid or a necro.. why? because past level 35 most nukes have a sizeable time cast on them and unless you have a snare of some sort, the mob will be all over you before you finish. <P>And after 50 you can pretty much forget it. Your pretty much limited to zones like trak's teeth and bw and skyfire right? those zones you cant run 30 feet (remember your both running full speed now) without hitting another mob, and you can forget circles.. so you still have to run through the mob back and forth. <P>Then theres the large drawback with cleric nukes overall.. there slow.. retrobution is 6 seconds, reckoning is 7 seconds, its a scientific FACT as soon as you start casting when the mob comes in to casting range, the mob WILL hit you well before you finish, and since most mobs will have a nice BASH ready to use, your spell will be interupted (On trak raids, even big mobs like sebelite jugs died so fast, clerics who nuked because they had no healing to do, would laugh that they could only get 1 nuke in on the mob before it died, sometimes not even that, many instead used the fast casting 220 damage stun). Theres also the little annoying part of ALL our damage dealing spells, they are magic based, and if every mob has a high resistance to anything.. it will be magic first. soloing at 55 and up is downright impossible using this method except on maybe a few rare low blue mobs some peeps might find, but theres allways some mobs for all classes that would be easy to solo. <P>In conclusion, id of course only recommend such a spell/ability be high level because of the exploits that could happen in the lower levels. And as I mentioned in my post, the spell would have some safty checks that would tie directly into avoiding things like soloing, like the added damage shield that would make the abilitie poof as soon as the cleric got hit and the damage shield was used up.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>About the whole "click off an effect" thing, wouldn't a good rule of thumb be that if you cast a self targeted buff spell it should always overwrite any similar buff (take precedence). I mean the player is essentially saying "No, I want THIS buff" and since I don't think there is any reason for buffs to prevent "hostile takeovers" I think that makes sense.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Uh, shamans HAVE a form of mana regenration, all casting classes do but clerics, thats kind of the point of the discussion.  However all forms of mana regenration have a cost, be it HP or lack of movement.  The cleric one I sugested with a dicipline that gives the cleric mana but keeps them from moving or hearing anything is simular to the druid treeform spell in that clerics can't move but even harsher on the cleric by not alowing any comunication.  And NOT imbalancing.<P>PLEASE don't make it a spell, we have a VERY limited number of spell slots as it is.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Another idea that's been broached was the ability for a cleric to have a spell called angelform, similar to the necro skeleton illusion and the druids wolf form, no special abilites were listed for form because the form it self would be cool but what about a small mana regen boost when in this form or failing that may be a low grade levitate. I'd be happy with just the illusion.

</FONT><HR>Everything sounds great - there's just one issue I wanted to bring up and that is Aegolism.<P>1) 750 mana per cast is too high. Reagant wise, it is fine and I don't think the cost needs to be adjusted.<P>2) This is our mega cool L60 buff - but it doesn't stack with the mega cool L60 druid buff, which is better because of the clarity effect. So basically, the spell will get shelved. It seems a pity that something designed to make a cleric's life easier (one spell for all three buffs) becomes useless. Why not make this a combined group AC/symbol without the heroism component. If we have no druid in the group, we just cast two buffs - group hero and this. If we do have a druid, we just cast the one.<P>I don't want to shelf my spell - it means going back to casting six symbols (group symbol being the lower level one) and six AC buffs. I also fail to understand why we are suppose to be the best hp/ac buffers, but are top line spells are repeatedly made worthless. It was the same with Reso, pre-Kunark.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Standing Meditation: Good Idea, maybe give it to all priest classes as they are alot more likely to get in and take a few swings than those robe wearing panzies *cough*casters*cough*. You could make this weapon based so they return mana you would get for sitting and medding each time you swing your weapon (based on how fast the weapon is the slower you swing the more mana you regain per swing, the faster you swing the slower you regain mana per swing so it equals the ammount you would have gotten when sitting yes very complicated mathimatically but overall it all adds up).<P>Bash: Nice... Might want to give this to Shamans as well as all shamans (cept Iksar) can SLAM naturally. It would be lovely to see them hit for more than 1 point of damage. Perhaps even give it to us Druids, it would encourage the use of shields over the use of other stuff (Paw of Opalla, Testament of Vaneer). Maybe Clerics get it at 20, Shaman at 30 and Druids at 35.<P>Stun: I agree Level 58 stun should be a lure type spell but then enchanters need a lure type mezmerize as well.<P>Bind Wounds: Just give everyone the max possible bind wounds and leave it at that. Not like bandaging 60 or so HP every 12 seconds is too unbalancing at the 40+ game.<P>Death Pact/Divine Intervention: Why not make this an entirely new line.<BR>Level 29 - Chance of Working (10-20%). Health Returned (20%). 1pp Reagent<BR>Level 39 - Chance of Working (20-30%). Health Returned (30%). 2pp Reagent<BR>Level 49 - Chance of Working (30-40%). Health Returned (40%). 3pp Reagent<BR>Level 59 - Chance of Working (50%). Health Returned (50%). 5pp Reagent<P>Heal over Time - All Clerical spells should stack with the Regen/Chloro/Regrowth lines as well as any sort of Druid/Shaman Heal over Time spells that come out (Tropor or whatever its called)<P>Mark of Karn - How about turning this into its own line as well? A lower level version would be fun to play with (isnt it a 6hp healing shield that strips damage shields off the target?)<P>Poison/Disease Curing - Give Clerics Abolish Disease and Abolish Poison. Shaman have Abolish Disease and Counteract Poison. Give Druids Abolish Poison at 49 and then everything will be balanced as 1 Druid + 1 Shaman = 1 Cleric in this department.<P>Self Invis - Make a CLR/PAL only item that gives a self invis. As it stands these two classes are the only classes who dont have it and its almost essential for every class to have.<P>Gate to Temple - GREAT idea! Make it a Self Only Level 39 spell (possibly GROUP at 49). But the only problem is when you deal with deities who have multiple temples it could get messy. Ofcourse you have the means to restrict the scrolls to specific races/classes. Thus a GNOME and a DWARF would have different spells that would bring them to their own temples. It could get confusing tho.<P>Lull Spells - This is a ENC/PAL problem as well. Make this line check like LIFETAP/STINGING SWARM LINE series does. Almost unresistable unless the mob is seriously out of your level range or 100% MR<P>Banishment of Shadows - I think this is also a druid concern as they have a spell line like this too and get an instant kill/poof of a summoned creature. Hows about making it an instant cast and use something like Star Rose Quartz or something.<P>Group Resists - Another thing that I want to look across the board. Druids get Group Fire/Cold, Shaman get Group Disease/Cold, Cleric get Group Poison/Disease and Enchanters get Group Magic.<P>Root/Mez undead - Nice! Unless the Root undead checks like a lure it wont be useful tho. The MEZ undead would help alot though.<P>Deity Specific Items - This isnt a CLERIC only thing. What about those warriors who chose Rallos Zek or others who chose unfavorable race/deity combinations (Erudite Necro/SK who worships Cazic, ect...)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I enjoyed reading this post. I have an idea to add. I would like to to see a diety specific symbol/item that is revered bythat diety. a "Holy" symbol, for lackof a better word. Should be worn/held. (Necklace, bracers, hand item...etc)And It should be an epic quest that spans many levels starting at 9 or lower. It should gain abilities and bonus things as you go up in strength, all the way to 60. One for example should be a mana regen. either a clickable time delay effect, or an effect likea bard song, but at clarity2 levels at higher levels. Or, a divine aura that is group affecting and is an evac, to the temple of the diety. (This would be fun with a Dark Elf cleric in a group of Paladin's... <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">...) I would also like to see a Wisdom bonus added to the Cleric Quest armor. I think this should be in addition to what they currently have. I must also say I am very impressed with the group exp bonus. I have had more fun playing my cleric lately than ever before. I am kind of still an EQ virgin. I have no characters near 60, nor do i have the time t invest, if I want my marrige and job to continue. These recent exp point bonuses have made the casual gaming time I do have so much more enjoyable. Thank you Absor!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I just want to add a couple comments regarding the request for Invisibility.  This is not just for getting to resses.  If you are a cleric who spends most or all of your time grouped in dungeons or raids, you probably don't need invis much ... there is always someone around to invis you.  But for those of us who operate on more limited time schedules, the post 50 game often does not allow us to do those activities that much of the time.  Invis would allow me more options during limited time periods: exploration, soloing, working on quests, obtaining items for tradeskills, and frankly, just going and getting some items all by my lonesome.  In short, it would add more pure FUN in the post 50 game for people who can't often play long time periods.<P>OTOH, it does not unbalance the game in the slightest.  No class profits at all from invising others.  No one would be harmed or slighted in the least.  It's a simple step that would just inject more enjoyment for a lot of us.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>STANDING MEDITATION III<BR>-----------------------<P>Ranjar, you are entirely correct.<P>To all of you who say "no, we should have it" I wholly disagree and ask that you consider EVERY possible thing you have to stand up to do, and that sitting down makes either impossible or dangerous.<P>Aggro and medding in a fight is one prime example.  When the cleric has reached a point from healing in a fight that he cannot sit down to meditate without drawing the mob, (which is a problem suffered by EVERY CASTER when they draw taunt) then they have to remain standing or simply get hit for the max damage that creature can pump out in one of its combat 'rounds'.  That could mean a quad of max damage (dual wield, double attack) from that nasty mob if you sat down at the wrong time!  Giving clerics the ability to simply IGNORE this problem is by far an unbalancing proposal.<P>What does the cleric do to avoid this?  Well, for starters, don't taunt that much.  This sounds so simple it's stupid (if it hurts, don't do it) but it's true - just like Rangers who do so much damage in a short amount of time that they complain even Jolt won't save them... why didn't they just turn off autoattack for a second when it started getting bad?  A Ranger who lived and did less damage is more useful than one who died.  So the cleric learns to use root, enstill, stuns, even Atone to make up for the times that they blundered, or they stand there and take a few hits until someone can taunt the mob off, and wait a long while to sit back down.  They screwed up building too much taunt, so they don't get the mana from meditating.  If that changes for Clerics, then Druids and Shamans (who have DoTs and debuffs that build taunt even more than cleric healing) are being spit upon.<P>What about visibility?  In the pre-34 EQ, meditation is a complete visibility blind.  For those people who are going to turn on attacker chat filters (who really wants to see exactly how often the two group rogues, the group bard, and the group ranger hit, miss, or sing songs? especially when an important 'ADD!' or 'RUN FOR IT' might be groupsaid...) they're even more required to just watch the HP bars and stand up occasionally to get an eye of what's going on.  In a mana sense, unless they're casting when they stand up, they wasted mana (could have been meditating) by hopping to their feet.  So if "standing meditation" is implemented, why wouldn't a cleric simply turn on their wide-view third-person perspective and monitor everyone and everything around them while healing?  I know I would.  Again, completely unfair to everyone else to give this to the cleric.<P>What about those who say "ah, but the pre-34 EQ doesn't matter, this should only be a high level skill!" too, hmm?  Double standard.  Complain about the 'fun' of being a cleric, but forget entirely that the moment they get Greater Healing, the cleric better darn well have their rear on the ground and nose in a book.  What happens to everyone between 19 and 34?  It wasn't important for playing a cleric to be 'fun' then, but it is after that?  No way in Norrath will I accept that as the answer, even if the game gets three times more fun past that point it still isn't worth it for those who have NEVER GOTTEN THERE.  The guy who plays a cleric up to 30 and stops, even though it's his highest level guy, because it "just wasn't fun" compared to any of his alts, isn't going to care whether or not 50+ clerics got something to make it 'fun' for them.<P>Clerics have fewer spells than others.  Many of them are completely ineffectual (lull, soothe, calm) because of their lack of reliability.  Many are simply restricted to functionality in certain areas of EQ, or are better done by other classes (flash of light, fear, root) because the cleric's mana is ultimately THE best at handling the heal, hands down.  Clerics are incredibly group-reliant.  They do not melee well, they do not take damage well, although they generally have a higher AC than the four pure casters.<P>What does this higher AC boil down to?  It's not important that higher AC (higher defense skill, etc.) be upped for the purposes of melee, because melee requires offense skill, a well-suited weapon, and lots of practice.  What group-suited cleric actually has a lot of time to spend swinging a weapon that simply won't connect very often, and when it does will likely result in minimal damage? (Strength sacrificed for wisdom: we aren't Paladins.) Adding Bash doesn't fix this, as we shouldn't be up there meleeing in the first place.<P>The SOLE reason I see to up defense skills at all is merely to give that cleric who got jumped and attacked a chance to take a few more hits than the pure casters would before -requiring- a rescue.  Yes, channeling might mean the cleric can heal themselves if they really need it, but it's more important to everyone else that the cleric live so he can keep THEM alive, and self-healing only builds that taunt factor.  Root might get it off the cleric long enough to re-taunt, but even during that time it's important to have had the defense skill.  Not so the cleric could swing their mace better.  Not so they can mix it up next to the Paladin, the Ranger, the Warrior, or by the gods - the Shaman!<P>What is an EQ Shaman?  A ritualist, barbaric, spiritualist "priest".  Who do they serve?  Justice. Hate. Fear. The Glory of War.  These are ideals of which great personal strength and combat ability IS an important part.<P>What is an EQ Cleric?  A holy man/woman, one closer to the God of their people, the speaker of the words of their gods and teacher of those truths.  A healer, and in many cases the hand that walks forth to do battle with the scourge that MUST be cleansed, but always with their guard at their arm and men of devotion at their side! (Paladin or Shadowknight) The cleric is NOT the hand that strikes down that scourge themselves, ideally.  They are the force of will behind the cleansing, the purification, the Jihad, but they support the arms of devoted warriors who stand to fight.  Who do they serve?  Love. Life. Truth. Community. Peace. Protection of the weak. Balance.  And yes, evil deities: Hate, Fear and Pain, and Death and Decay.  But the cleric's role in even these forms of evil worship are not those ultimate hands that strike down the 'good' themselves, but the mouth that speaks the words of Hate, or Fear, or Death, to the true followers who draw their power from it and go out to spread their stain of evil across the land.<P>I play a Human Cleric of Bertoxxulus.  I roleplay him as a Prophet.  I try to teach others the truth of their mortality.  The phrase most commonly heard by me is this: "There is but one ultimate truth in Norrath, one ultimate truth of the Plaguebringer, and it is this: all things must die."  Does that mean I'm going to stand there and kill them with my mace?  NO!  Does that mean I'm going to smite them with holy-granted power?  NO!  That DOES mean I'll refute their foolish ways with words, and intelligence, and if they choose to attack I can stun, cancel their magics, heal myself, root, them, and get away long enough to call my fellow faithful to arms.  And those who dared attack the Prophet of the Plaguebringer will shiver as the scourge of the Shadowknights of Bertoxxulus strip their very flesh from their bones.<P>I don't want invisibility as a spell.  Put it on my armor, sure.  That's an enchanted item that I can seek to aid my calling.  I don't have time to learn the spells of invisibility, regardless of what people say about "everyone else gets it"... if that's the case, talk to "everyone" and have them cast it on you.  Invis to undead is appropriate, as undeath is a scourge to be cleansed/appropriated and some power over THEM makes sense.  I'll not fool mens' minds with invisibility, only to have them distrust the true words I speak about my god as if they were ranting from a deceitful trickster!<P>I don't want higher offense skills.  What cleric stands before their foe and strikes them with the mace or staff to kill them?  Clerics are given the ability to kill when needed, and sparingly... (mana expensive) their power is in healing.<P>I don't want a self-gate to my temple!  If you, a cleric, need THAT then you haven't been spreading the word to enough Wizards (or Druids, in the case of Karana and Tunare) yet.  Any faithful Wizard/Druid who is a member of your temple should be willing to assist the chosen priests of their order.  Gating back to the Temple is not a power given to those who go out into the world and tell - it's given to those who cower within their ivory towers.  That is not the Priest!<P>Yes, I can shove something with my shield.  Who can't?  But Bash is an offensive skill.  Just like I never learned to parry with my mace (Turn aside a blade with a blunt weapon?  They'll sever my hand first!) or attack with a staff in each hand, I never learned the proper way to get past a dangerous foe's guard with my shield to strike them.  Any fool can run headlong, shield held before them, and any fool can be surprised when the warrior they fight merely side-steps and heaves a foot of steel through one's gut.  No bash for clerics.<P>Why would I bind wounds with a bandage when my god gives me their blessed power of healing?  To refrain from its use on the faithful is to spurn such a gift, and even binding the wounds of my god's foes is sacrilige.  I have my prayers.  Bandages are for the less devout - to spurn my healing ability in favor of a bandage is to call into question my very faith in that which sustains me.<P>I am the holy speaker of the words of my god.  I tell my comrades what the god has decreed, I interpret his wishes in every circumstance.  I bless, I provide for, and I defend the swords and arms of the faithful and valiant with my prayers.  Praying for each, in turn, is a blessed act - but not all situations allow for this individual attention.  A greater prayer, calling for the favor of the divine one upon us all in a group blessing of protection, seems entirely in order; it would, however, be less effective than individually ministering to the needs of my comrades.  I would hope that the particular prayers themselves for the many are not commonly known: quests to recover group prayers would be the only way that these should be provided.<P>Just as the faithful Wizards will port, so too will the faithful enchanters mesmerize my foes.  I will smite when I must smite, and I will dismiss the undead when I am called to dismiss: but the enchanter is relied upon for their abilities and I will not ask them to be relied upon for mine.  I have no need of mesmerization or root of undead, when my root will suffice for all, and the enchanters' mesmerize will do the same.  If there are no faithful amongst the enchanters, perhaps they too are a scourge waiting to be cleansed?<P>What deity is more divine than my own?  I know the spells he provides me, and I believe wholly that they will sustain me.  If my god sees fit to reveal a greater mystery and a greater power to mine eyes, then so be it: but what deity is able to reveal to its chosen a mystery that no other deity can pierce?  Just as Tunare created the elves, so too was Innoruuk able to warp them into his image.  Solusek Ro was able to blast life into a searing death, and even to this day the Sands of Ro yet smolder in their heat.  Why should Prexus be the only lord to fathom a secret of the deep, when Karana's continual rains draw from the deep itself?  Deity-specific prayers and spells, while possible, open a huge Pandora's Box of problems that only (message-board) Jihad would resolve.  Let the faithful chosen bear their Symbols of Faith with pride.  Let us earn the station of Regent and beyond with our toils and our faith, and let our god's unique touch reach us through his markers.  Is the symbol not enough?  Then perhaps a scepter or signet is an appropriate chalice to fill with holy power... but these are but ramblings.  I would not dare to be wiser than my god and say 'this, this is where you must bless me'.<P>I am the Prophet Wascen Witherfist.  I am the tainted tongue of the Plaguebringer, but I speak the truth: you and I are mortal.  Do not dare redefine me as a loathed Paladin, nor force me to strike out alongside the Shadowknights rather than behind them, for I have chosen my own path.<P>I am the Cleric.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
