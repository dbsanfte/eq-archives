</FONT><HR>Fear is not where shaman/druid healing is deficient.  Fear is a pre-RoK zone, the mobs don't hit particularly hard, especially if the players have RoK/SoV gear.  Go to Icewell Keep and tell me how well a shaman heals.  Go fight Juggers in Seb and tell me how well a shaman heals.  Most fear stuff is pathetically weak to a group of mid-50s players.<P>Alchemy and armour are trivial items.  There are no earthshattering problems here, just little things that if fixed would make you go, "ooh, that is sort of nice."  The things that need addressing with shaman are huge things that affect the viability and desireability of the class at the higher end of the game.  Changing the effect on a piece of JB or Spiritweaver's armor isn't going to matter much compared to being able to heal or debuff against raid level mobs in SoV.<P>Dwilgar<BR>Luminary of Rallos Zek<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Those who think shaman/druid healing can cope are obviously either pre-50th or playing in old world zones. I play a 55th shaman - I never had any real complaints about my healing ability until 51st+. From the 30s to 50th it is less than a clerics - but I could cope with slow/regen. <P>Now it is ridiculous - Kunark/Velious/Hole mobs all hit much harder, faster and have nastier resists than anything from Fear or Hate. There is a reason most 50th+ guilds only "farm" fear/hate -thats because the zones are a joke once you are high enough and equipped in kunark/velious's finest. <P>Tell me again how exactly my superior heal that heals 650pts (and fizzles half the time or more) is supposed to cope with a mob that easily does 800+ pts in the time it takes me to cast it??</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>TOPIC: CANNIBALIZE<P>Because so many of us have aching fingers...<P>I would suggest all cannibalize spells be made 5 times more potent and tack on a 30 second recast delay.<P> - This maintains the same Mana/HP ratio but gives our fingers a break.<P> - The long recast delay prevents the spell from being chain cast so the mana return is no greater over time than it is currently.<P>Name:  Cannibalize <BR>Level:  24 <BR>Mana:  0 <BR>Type:  Self Only Instant Mana Increase <BR>Actual Effects: Self: Decrease HP (250), Self Increase Mana (140)<BR>Ratio: 0.56 mana per HP.<P>Name:  Cannibalize II <BR>Level:  39 <BR>Mana:  0 <BR>Type:  Self Only Instant Mana Increase <BR>Actual Effects: Self: Decrease HP (335), Self Increase Mana (165)<BR>Ratio: 0.49 mana per HP.<P>Name:  Cannibalize III <BR>Level:  54 <BR>Mana:  0 <BR>Type:  Area Effect Hate List Reduction <BR>Actual Effects: Actual Effects: Self: Decrease HP (375), Self Increase Mana (190)<BR>Ratio: 0.50 mana per HP.<P>Q: Why would a shaman cast anything but Cannibalize 1 with this new scheme?

If anything is needed to balance a shaman it's making our buffs mean something. <P>I understand that changing the effect stats have would imbalance the game. That's not what we're asking for. <P>Let me repeat that, that's not what we're asking for. <P>What we would like is for "The Masters of Buffing" to be given buffs that are more useful than the ones we have.

</FONT><HR>EvilChu,<P>1) Iksar shaman do not need JB armor. Again, I can achieve a better ac/wis rating with seb scale armor than the other races in full hate gear. How do I know this? Because again, I am in a uber-guild with shamans that have had full RE armor BEFORE Kunark came out.<P>2) How do I know I am blowing away other shamans stats? Again, I have the other shaman in my guild to pull my information from. 2 pieces of SW armor(arms and BP) with a Spear of Fate and various other pieces of equipment vs. the shaman in my guild with full JB armor. At currect I have a 200 wis(swapped out a Tobrin's Mystic Eyepatch for a Bone Mask of the Jarsanth last night TO BURN EXCESS wis I had. Was at 211 before doing so) and a 1010 ac SELF BUFFED. Not full cleric/enchanter buffs, but SELF buffed with only 2, yes 2, pieces of SW armor compared to FULL JB armored shamans. One of the shamans in my guild with FULL JB armor has a 1029 ac(yes higher than mine) but only has a 189 wis(lower than mine) when doing so. He is a barbarian(the second highest starting wis base shaman) so he comes no where near competeing with 48 hp per tick regen(natural regen + fungis tunic + bearform + regrowth) that I can obtain when sitting. Yes, I lose 14 points of wis when wearing the tunic as well as some ac, but so does my guildmate when he puts on his tunic to regen faster also.<P>Zukaril Dreadfire &lt;The Harmonium&gt;<BR>level 58 Iksar Luminary of Xev.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I like the Cannibalize suggestion EvilChu - it was something I was hoping for prior to RoK being released.  I wouldn't consider it a priority item that greatly effects the balance of shaman (i.e. doesn't need immediate attention), but it would be something I wouldn't mind seeing changed down the road.

</FONT><HR>  Deadpool, I don't understand you bro. The post is about the balance between the caster melee utility balance.  Where does my post say fix the wizard and the shaman will be okay.<P>Its about balance.  If you are capable ask your self is a shaman both a caster of damage and utility class as well??? HuH??? Its you, me,and everyone on the caster side I am talking about.<BR>I must not be clear.<P>I should not have posted that whole wizard post and am sorry i was lazy the only part relating to shaman has to do wiht the caster and caster/utility class imbalance exsisting vs the melee side of that equation.<P>You dont have to agree just dont quote me as saying something I did not. If the basic game balance is not restablished first, these fourteen different class needs will only serve to make it worse.  Thats the point and it has to do with shaman casters as well as all the other casters.<P>Just an opinion.  Study the issue a little bit and you might not agree but it does seem logical.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am posting this for a follow Shaman from my Guild(he is unable to get to the board):<BR>----<BR>Although you covered some areas of  shaman that needed fixing, you<BR>FAILED to see two<BR>of the major issues concerning Shaman!!!  Also are a few other things<BR>that need<BR>correcting.<P>1- Power post 50, including sov.  As you know, we get one new dd in the<BR>50’s, which is<BR>basically useless against mobs in sov.  We are in turn forced to use a<BR>44 dd which against<BR>high lvl sov mobs isn’t quite damaging.  We also get 2 new dots which<BR>are bascially non<BR>existant the server.  With our long casting time and low damage dd, it<BR>obvious shaman are<BR>not supposed to be a short term damage impact upon a battle.  This is<BR>fine.  We should be<BR>able to do ALOT of damage over time.  We should have spells that work<BR>like splurt that<BR>take twice the time and do three times the damage.  Let us be important<BR>for the long term<BR>battles, as most battles are over before our poison dot can even<BR>complete itself, when it<BR>comes to damage.  Our spells are nothing impressive post 50, and the<BR>following changes<BR>should be made.<BR>a- at 56+ we should receive an unresistable 66% slow spell.  (its not<BR>very effective<BR>burning half your mana just trying to slow a mob that has been malo’d<BR>already)<BR>b- a very high damage, very long to finish dot like splurt. (length of<BR>disease dot)<BR>c- more stackable dots<BR>d- a spell that covers in one spell our best str/dex/agi/sta/talisman in<BR>one shot.  Make it<BR>the same mana as casting all individualy is fine.<BR>e- We should receive an upgrade to Regrowth in high 50’s.  We get these<BR>spells first<BR>always, and should have the best single as we will never have the group<BR>version.<P>2- Abilities in regards to shaman.  Here is one area where we are<BR>greatly lacking.  Shaman<BR>should have some special ablities to increase the fun and enjoyment of<BR>the game.<BR>a- Shaman should be able to track  mobs with spirits (non undead, maybe<BR>that can be<BR>given to cleric or necro).  This should be given 50+.<BR>b- Shaman should be able to learn 1 self teleport per contenent,<BR>including one to go home.<BR>c- Shaman click an INCREDIBLE amount more with canabalize, and its just<BR>no fun when<BR>your finger hurt from doing so.  We should have something similar to<BR>lich form in effect<BR>only.  Even if its the same ratio as can3, it will save us a thousand<BR>clicks a night. Try<BR>spending 4 hours being the only healer doing stand/can/sit over and over<BR>and over.<BR>d- Shaman should get spells that are an offshoot of canabalize, meaning<BR>a dot on a mob<BR>that regens our mana for their decline in health. (natural continuing of<BR>shaman power.)<BR>e- if there is any sow2, shaman should get this as we get all sow spells<BR>first.  Personally, I<BR>would like to see a self only sow2 for shamans with spirit of cheetah<BR>speed.<P>re: spear of fate<BR>There should be no casting time associated with this.  Rapid clicks<BR>obvously would not<BR>assist in any damage whatsover, as its not like a dot that does damage<BR>up front.  The range<BR>also needs to be greatly extended, as you have to basically be in melle<BR>range of alot of<BR>mobs to cast.. they hit you during current long cast time.. spell<BR>fizzles.. redo and hope for<BR>the best.<P>I hope you will look at these suggestions, and the power involved of<BR>shaman post 50, as<BR>well as our ability and spells.  Your list is a step in the right<BR>dirction, I hope you will take<BR>it further.<P>If you have any questions, please contact me ingame.<BR>Toggo<BR>56 troll shaman Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Good, I'm rather happy with the list of stuff to look at, I think that will help a lot!<P>A couple of quick asides as well...<P>Alchemy: I'd love to get the potion costs down to something more reasonable...  If a person on your design team plays a shaman who can do so, go make some Potions of Power and try to sell them.  At ANY price.  I'd love the vendor buyback prices to get closer toward 80% like the other trade skills seem to be.  6p2g to make a SoW, I'm offered 9g4s by a vendor.  940/6200=0.151, or 15.1% at 103 CHA.  Making it profitable only by selling to a player is fine, but this hurts too much.  My 35th Shaman has hung up his medicine bag for now.  I'll make SoW potions by request, but that's about it.<P>Pets:  My 34 pet and I were in Mistmoore last night.  He hit most times for somewhere between 1 and 7 dmg.  Basically he was an elaborate and not horribly effective meat shield.  He beats the heck out of nothing I suppose.<P>Gate potions only for the iksar?  Why?  Why can't all shamen buy or make potions to let them gate themselves home?  I run it most times, and it's nothing more than an annoyance.  With SoW there's nothing on the Old Continent that can't be easily avoided that can catch me with SoW or Scale of Wolf on.  Making a nodrop potion with a low component cost would be very nice.  Remember, I can get a port to North Karana for a usual max of 10pp, so if the potion costs 20pp or more to make, I'd probably rather just run!<P>Even if you gave us potions to allow us to port to everywhere the druids can (and I do think a limited subset of the port spells would not be out of line), as long as they cost 20pp or more to make (making them 30-50pp to sell to cover losses) people would use them as needed, but only if other methods weren't available.  I think it'd maintain the balance if the potions ONLY worked within the same area as a druid ring maybe, or if that's too hard to implement(from a technical standpoint), what about at least making a 'can teleport potion' flag on a zone like the 'is a dungeon' and 'is outside' flag?<P>Looks like you've hit the majority of the biggest, ugliest concerns in that list at least.<P>I think there may be hope for my shaman after all!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree 100% Dwilgar.  We will only have a few things upgraded (and I am sceptical of that).  Lets get the most bang for the buck.  We need to forget about racial, alchemy or minor issues relating to shaman.  Lets get the big ones fixed first and fore most.<P>1)  Fizzles on spells - We know which ones they are.  I think someone had a list generated.  IMO, no spell should fizzle more than any other.  Period.  Very, very poor way of balancing classes.<P>2)  Spell drops - Take a look at the spell drops to make sure that everyone has a chance at obtaining their spells.  I think this goes for every class in EQ, not just shaman.<P>3)  Healing - I think Dwilgar got this correct.  I think there is an added bonus to shamans and druids getting additional healing powers.  Clerics have long complained, rightfully so, that they do nothing by heal, sit and med.  By giving shaman and druids extra healing, clerics may be able to use their mana for other spells, spells which shaman or druids dont get.  Like stuns.  Kill 2 birds with one stone.  Note:  This does not solve cleric, shaman or druid concerns by itself.  BTW, ever try to heal a tank rich party in DN after your cleric goes LD.  Get my point.<P>Last but not least......<BR>**************************************************<BR>4)  Roles of Shaman - Ok Verant, what do we do?  You dont really know do you.  I am sure that the class discussions opened your eyes to a LOT of things that you did not know.  Shaman, can do a lot of things.  We can:<P>Buff<BR>De-buff<BR>Dot<BR>DD<BR>Cast utility spells like lev, invis<BR>Create potions<BR>Solo<BR>Add significatly to groups<BR>etc.....<P>The list goes on.  We are fortunate in that regard.  However, due to the nature of the EverQuest environment, we are by nature DE-BUFFERS.  That is our strongest line of spells IMO.  Slow line and resistance de-buff lines are the bread and butter of 39+ shaman.  This is where we have the greatest impact to the game.  To that end items and spells should have highlighted that aspect.  This has not been the case to up to this date.  I think by your ignorance of what shaman really do, you have caused a significant problems on Shamans with the 2 expansions to date, Kunark and Velious.<P>I hope that something comes out of this.  I have serious reservations though.  Your track record is poor at best.  IMO, you are only doing this because you see a bunch of people in your rear view mirror.<P>Hemdall Spiritguide<BR>Rodcet Nife<BR>57th level</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Someone suggested an unresistable 66% slow spell.  This is way unbalancing, no matter what mana cost you put on it.  As is, slow is already incredibly good, making an unresistable version which is nearly as good as the resistable versio n is asking way too much.  A 25% lure resist slow is a much more reasonable request.<P>Some more minor items to consider:<P>* Fizzles<P>The biggest two I see (this assumes the test fixes to sup healing) are cannibalize 3 and the rage line.  Really depressing to chain fizzle a level 49 spell.<P>* Damage level on DoTs<P>This isn't a huge item persay, just something to consider in light of the changes made to other classes.  Shaman DoTs prior to RoK were fairly well balanced compared to top end wizard spells.  Our DoTs did a bit more efficient damage, but were disadvantaged in that it took time to realize the damage and the lack of stackability.  Given the huge hit points on a lot of SoV mobs, it might be worth looking at the damage levels on the 2 shaman DoTs received post level 50.<P>* Spell drops<P>This isn't necessarily shaman unique, but it really would be nice is some of the more important shaman spells were actually obtainable.  Noteably, tigir's insects, bane of nife, and pox of bert.<P>I don't consider any of the above 3 items to be of the magnitude of the 5 key items I identified earlier, but they are all areas that could use minor improvements.<P>Dwilgar<BR>Luminary of Rallos Zek<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Class defining is something you bring to a group that changes what the outcome would have been.<P>The ones that do this best are Tanks, Clerics, Enchanters.

They will not change the outcome of an encounter.  I mean you can call the ability to add to strength better than any other class a class defining ability but I do not.  If you believe teleports, potion making, tinkering, the best dd spell in the game, buffs,  etc.. are all class defining abilities then you will never balance that poor class.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>Balductum... ¥</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Short of rewritting tons of underlying code and rebalancing every item in the game that has a +STAT on it, there is no way to make shaman stat buffs more relevant.  Yeah, it would be great if a buff to a given stat made a tank 20 to 50% more efficient, but it isn't going to happen.  Actually, given the mana costs and durations of the level 51+ buffs, it is probably unrealistic to even think they should increase tanking efficiency by more than 10% (which they generally don't).  I really don't know what shaman are expecting for a 100-150 mana spell that lasts more than 1 hour.  Certainly someone expecting results on par with a haste spell is have a hard time grasping basic concept of game balance.  I think I did a basic calculation on page 2 of this thread; to be efficiency equivalent to celerity, manical strength only needs to increase melee damage by 5.4%.  Does it actually do this?  Sometimes, not always - depends on what you are fighting and what class/race you give the buff to.  But that is part of the challenging of being a shaman, learning when to use each of our many tools.<P>Some shaman seem to come slow to the realization that short of an incredible line of attack speed slow down spells, a shaman's strength is in his/her ability to do a broad range of things rather well.  Unfortunately, in the post 50 game, we basically do most everything poorly and that is why changes are needed.<P>Dwilgar<BR>Luminary of Rallos Zek<BR>Rodcet Nife<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>From Dirk_Tuggler_KTF<P>"ITEM: Jaundiced Armor.<P>Addendum: While I don't want to take anything from our Iksar cousins, please consider the only balancing points of Iksar Shaman vs. Old world Shaman are: lack of slam and inability to wear Jaundiced (eg, no bracer nukes). If Iksar gain the larger of these 2 abilities, there will be no real point to playing an old-world Shaman. They will have the best everything: Best regen, Best night sight, best armor, best innate AC bonus, best newbie areas, best central location in Kunark, etc. All for the same XP penalty a Troll pays now."<P>Take if from a Iksar Shaman level 54. First of All Ogre gets more hp than a iksar could achieve.. therefore the regen effect compensates for lack of hitpoints between the 2 races.<P>At lower levels regen is nice yes. Level faster.. but wait.. iksar got xp penalty! Woot Even the Score! Its actually a major hinderance at higher levels.. a few hp regen at level 54 means nothing when getting hit for 139+ dmg doubles.<P>An ogre doesn't have to worry about a strength spell all the time. As shaman we wearing chain type weight armor, iksar got the lowest str , lowest stamina, but the highest wis by 5 and good agi start stats. I have 95 str with about the best gear an iksar can get in the game.. I am almost encumbered and have to use a str spell / sow to not be hindered. Best armor? Get real.. look at the ac bonus of JB and effects. About the Best an Iksar Shaman can achieve be the Sebilite Armor until recently the release of Velious. By far Barbie/Troll/Ogre get a better broad of items usable by them. Iksar are strongly lackin in the item catagory. JB BRacer is the prized 1 item a shaman gets everyone wants a free nuke and a 200+ one is a good one. Even Barbarians get special shaman only weapons (spiritist shield/spiritist hammer) along with troll and ogres (totem of windenshears) for example. Iksar shaman only item? Never heard of one yet. Also iksar got the worst faction in the game. Try wanting to bank in another town before velious came out or buy supplies. Faction building is the worst. Also Iksar shaman to get alchemy sow potions need to build faction up coz you can't buy supplies for sow potions in cabilis.<P>Don't forget though we got a forage ability that if ya lucky in 1 hr of time you get 1 water / 1 food but spend using up 2 water/ 2 food. <BR>- Worthless ability - used for mundane not even worth the time quests. Skill never goes up.<P>With a bonus of 5 wis.. getting to 200 wis can be done.. but maintaing a good ac that we need as well for shamans is more difficult with the lack of good wis+ ac items that iksar shamans can use (before velious).<P>Hope getting a view point from yer cousin eyes might change your thoughts that Iksar are best shamans to be.. imho we be the worst and if I choose to play a shaman again.. it wouldn't be iksar with what I know now about the differences that you see at high levels between the races of this class.<P>Fahrn the Tight Wad Mad Trader of Ec on Bertox!<BR>who got more loot to know what to do with coz his shaman can't use hardly anything he gets lucky  on loot drops.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif"> !!<P>P.s.

These suggestions generally rely on adding "special effects" to the stat buff spells. The magnitude of these effects could be based on the total stat value, but the effects themselves would only occur while the buff was in place. If the mana cost for such a buff has to go up, so be it. But I don't want a bevy of next to useless spells sitting in my book. That's just stupid. This is particularly bad when you have tanks in your group who don't know that stats are almost useless and want you to waste your mana on them. To avoid the argument I always throw them when asked for but I know it just amounts to a mana drain.

</FONT><HR>My biggest concern is having our core abilities pimped to other classes.  One by one as new items and armor are discovered we are at less and less of an advantage.  What really got me was when I was not needed to join groups on a raid because the warrior was shrinking everyone.  Or someone not needing a dex buff because the enchanter can buff their dexterity better than me.<P>Stat buffs, as mentioned in the previous 500 pages of 500 discussions, need to make a difference.  I still try to keep them on a group because I am of the belief that 'every little bit helps', but I would like to see a warrior that I have buffed to 255 strength get a critical hit fifteen times base damage once in a blue moon.<P>As for infringing on a ranger's territory if we get a pure attack buff, since when did a RANGER become a better buffer than us?  If the Vision says we are to be masters of buffing, we need to get a pure attack buff line early, and have it increase throughout our career.  Why a druid can buff attack and we cannot is beyond me.<P>I support the idea that Torpor makes you FD for its duration.  I also support the idea that we receive a heal in line with the proposed druid heal at level 60, while moving Superior heal and Chloroblast to earlier levels.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Item: group buffs.<P>One thing that stands out to me for a reason that the group spells are less effective than the new buff spells for level 51-60 is the proximity of the level that the group buff is obtained to the level the single target buff is obtained.  (level 57 - single target str buff.  level 58 - group str buff).  It would seem that Verant was forced to make the group buff less effective since only one level seperates the two spells.  The same can be said for the dex buff.  The single target charisma buff actually is higher level than the group buff.  So If the true intentions of group buffs were to make them as effective as the original buff but less duration then why didnt the progression of spells for Kunark simply follow a more realistic pattern?  (level 51 - agi.  level 52 - stam.  level 53 - ac.  level 54 - str.  level 55 dex and cha.  level 56 - group agi.  level 57 - group stam.  level 58 - group str.  level 59 - group dex and cha.) <P>Item: Healing<P>"Shamans are supposed to be secondary healers"<BR>When I look at that statement I consider that if only the following races (ogre, barbarian, troll, and iksar) existed then shaman would be the primary healers!<BR>In the past shaman were always the best (simply due to the level shaman get the spell) at the single target heal over time -- regen and chloroplast.  When Kunark came out shaman recieved more nice heals over time - regrowth and Torpor.  These two spells kept shaman the masters of healing over time.  I would suggest that instead of moving Sup heal to 51, give shaman a spell akin to celestial healing/elixr (torpor spells without the negative effects) at level 51 then another at level 56 and upgrading Torpor a small amount.  This would keep the shamans roll as the master of the Heal over time cemented while keeping the cleric as the master of the "Instant immediate life saving Heal".<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am very disapointed with this list.<P>There were three things I really wanted to see addressed, and not just post 50.  The problems with the Shaman class exist from level 1 and just become more apparent as you go up in level.<P>1.  Stat Buffs.  Please make them work.  I and many others posted on this.  It was one of the most common posts and its not on your list.<P>You have a ton of suggestions from many customers on how to fix this without making a huge change to game dynamics.  Procs and static effects on each buff are the most common and best suggestions.<P>2. Desease DOTs, and the increase in dot power in the post 50 range.  Desease dots work to slowly, and post 50 many clases catch/pass our dot capabilities.<P>3. Alchemy is broken.  It cost a ton to do with little return.  No one can make money developing there skill to any level in this trade skill.  It needs a serious look.<P>Problem with the list:  It does nothing to address these issues.<P>Problem with the Shaman:  We are around for one purpose.  Our buffs are not requested by smart players, we can not heal worth anything.  Our DD damage is pathetic, our DoTs take to long to be used in a group.  We have one defining ability that makes us worth while.  We slow a mob down, and in velious we become poor healers.<P>Please add in buffs that are worth having.  This would make us work, and be worthwhile.<P>Based on your list, I will spend more time on my Necro, Enchanter, and Warrior.  The Necro for soloing, when I dont feel like taking the time to find a group, and the Enchanter and Warrior for the group.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>All I have to say is:<P>I am glad I stoped playing my Shaman in favor of a Warrior.<P>The shamans buff spells dont do jack, and thats 20% of what they get.  Fixing the buff spells (low level to high) was not even on the list.<P>Hopefully you guys wont create any other classes that have 20% of (and what you consider the defining ability of) there spells have so little to effect as to need a statistical analist to find the tiny benefit they offer.<P>I would like to play a shaman.  Its fun for roleplaying, but you make it a poor choice and show no sign of changing this. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What Shaman needs to be. We are yes primarily a slower to help enchanters/clerics due their job better in a group. We are a jack of many trades just really only master of the slow line of spells and master of the dot spell. <P>I think in general the shaman class needs to have a bit better impact when in groups is the following. We are basically a mix of many classes yet master of no specific trait except slow/dot. <BR>If able just improve these areas to a slightly higher degree of usefulness we be the ideal middle person in a standard group 1 warrior 1 cleric 1 enchanter 1 spellcaster 1 other class (shaman ideal spot for he can do a bit of everything that all these classes can do).<P>If possible to have all the stats and everything that goes with it.. a group of 6 shamans should be a very effective group on its own and balanced enough to take on most things.<P>Melee dmg - possible double hits at high level<BR>Pet       - just make them have a lot more hp.<BR>          - 59 pet spell as our last pet spell <BR>          - with a good ending (example Dire Wolf)<BR>Spells    - better post 50 group spells<BR>          - Healing spell that does 1k hp would<BR>            be very nice set back good aggro    <BR>            since we can actually tank something <BR>            with a slow spell.<BR>Tracking  - Would like to see shamans have a minor<BR>            form of tracking ability. But have <BR>            rangers/druids still outshine us. ? <BR>            why would a bard get this ability? <BR>Alchemy   - Needs major improvement u already know<P>Anybody else agree with my line of thinking or disagree?<P>Fahrn the Tight Wad Mad Trader of Ec on Bertox!<BR>who got more loot to know what to do with coz his iksar shaman can't use hardly anything he gets lucky on loot drops.  :rollseyes:!!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
