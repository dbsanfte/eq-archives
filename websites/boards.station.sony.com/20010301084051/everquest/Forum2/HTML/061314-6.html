</FONT><HR>If I understand the effect of the new taunt change for healing it has helped me quite a bit in the last few days.    I mostly hunt outside with a partner.    Before, the mob stuck pretty well to the tank.    Now I am able to peal the mob off and make it chase me with a Sup Heal.  The Tank then follows behind hitting the mob for a while till he gets it's attention again.  I let it damage him for a little while then heal again and repeat.     Though this method does not completely prevent damage to the tank it has been eliminating maybe half of the damage and lets me kite the mob with my 'pet'    <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>In my case it was a lower level tank (pre-50) and a higher level healer (post-50).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor:  Let me get this straight.<P>You consider this a challenge to work around for clerics, right?  What about all the abilities and removal of hinderances for hybrids?  Weren't those "challenges to be worked around"?  You whack clerics repeatedly with a nerf-stick and call it a "challenge"?  What kind of answer is that?   You offer the fact that we figure out ways around the nerfs, but is that what most people here would consider "fun"?  I don't find dying multiple times in a session in order to find out how to work around this problem "fun".  I don't think many others do either.  What if you took away all duel-wielding ability and told the melee classes it was a "challenge to overcome"?  I don't think it would fly with them and this issue sure hasn't flown with the one class it affects.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, this is nuts.  How can this be as intended?<P>A casual "just wants to play" char---  I spent the majority of my weekend playing my 27 chanter and ended up spending my time mezzing the mobs cranking our cleric.  Heals must be done!  It is ridiculous that every mob we fought went straight at the cleric the moment they healed someone.  An Enchanter should not be required for all groups to justify this change in healing aggro.<P>With my 45 character, I have seen much of the same.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The cleric class is a lost cause. Forced to group until 50 with absolutely no variation, forced to die after 50 because our one one class defining spell is like an AoE ice comet. No, its worse. I know wizzies that can get a COUPLE of ice comets off in a raid encounter, yet a cleric does (actually is forced to) a CH to save someone else and dies.<P>A lot is broken here. You have one class that can do three things, buff, heal and rez period. That is broken before you start. Then you "fix" the healing aggro on top of that and its even more broken. Give their skills to others who have more versatility, you get the drift, most clerics would agree that it is good that other priests got better healing, but clerics should have got at least a little something to compensation. Cleric quests are ridiculously time consuming, rewards are crap and much better stuff can be had for far less effort. Seems everything associated with clerics MUST have a dire downside to fit into The Vision (tm). Gloom and doom  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>Would anyone start a character in a class that has the rep of being boring as hell knowing that when they get to the more powerful levels there really isn't too much for them to look forward to except death or rezzing????<P>wotalotihaventgot</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OK, I did as requested by Absor and logged in quite a few hours with my level 53 cleric. I did both raid and exp grouping. About 10+ hours of each this weekend.<P>First my feelings on his request. I do not personally beleive I should test the results of the patch more throughly then they did before they made it live. I think that is irresponsible as all hell on verant's behalf. From now on I expect to see freaking patch changes on the test server 2 or more days before the patch. Or they better bend over and take it like (insert something here) when we get all pissy because they did it to themselves. Don't try and spin it off...you didn't test it, expect complaints.<P>That being said...<BR>1. I found myself using celestial healing ALOT. I think that if I must use heal over times to do my job properly then.<BR> a.) It should drop like candy or be purchasable. I spent 3 dasys in freeport trying to buy celestial healing for 1500pp and ended up having to camp it. Camping was a major hassle and the number of player hours involved was inappropriate.<BR> b.) We should have a spell between it and the celestial elixer.<P>2. On non-mezzable mobs the clerics were raped. I used my DA and DB often. Sometimes I couldn't cast under multiple mob pressure to get the spell off. I don't think healing should agro the mobs not fighting the guy you healed. That is a bit excessive when you have clerics tanking all the non-mezable adds. Possibly add a 3rd in the DA line, but problem is under DA I can not do my job and once DA is unable to be cast under pressure I get a rez...and unless I can survive 15mins I am EXTREMELY vulnerable ona raid.<P>3. On uber mobs I am scared to heal now. I managed fine...but my group was not taking much damage so I was not healing really fast like the other clerics were (if my tanks aren't taking the damage some other clerics tanks are).<P>4. I have too many heals to memorize now. I am unable to stun. Mobs are gating or running.<P>5. My mana efficency has gone to hell. Simply put 5 celestial heals is quite a bit more mana then one complete heal.<P>Recommendation?<BR>1. Move celestial elixer to 52<P>2. Add in a Complete heal over time spell at 56. Keep in mind you can't stack this so you can't really abuse it on uber mobs. Maybe cap it at 5k hp instead of 10k.<P>3. Make my spell not cast if they are already celestial elixered rather then saying it does not hold make it say "it would not hold" and have it do that before my casting time begins...you made clerics stack poorly now that we are all using heal DoT's....sigh. I want to know to either move to another tank or click remedy instead because the other clerics celestial spell is not keeping up with the damage. If I wait until it casts to find out I wasted mana and now the player is very low on HP...then that player is screwed. But there should maybe be a timing mechanism because we need to allow timed refreshes still. I don't want a 3 second pause after it runs out before I can refresh. Basically how many offensive DoT's stack? Why? So you can work with eachother? How many defensive dot's stack?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>i posted my observations on the patch and waited for a response...non came.  I re-read what the blue names had said, and i have this comment to make.<P>Someone said they bought the game for an everchanging world.  So did I.  I however see an everchanging world as new quests...storylines...a new long lost relic.  I see changes as those made in Kithicor and Split Paw as GOOD changes.  Storyline changes.  I see velious and Kunark as good.  So the mobs there are harder...big deal, thats waht those zones are for.  I bought the game because people were telling me that things were changing all the time..zones being added, zones being changed etc.  What hooked me on the game was several things.  When i first started playing people were still trying to figure out the majority of the quests...the majority of the items hadnt been found.  verant kept very quiet and didnt spill the beans as to where such and such an item was.  It was awesome.  I envisioned communities such as everlore and allakhzam...where people got together and helped each other...and poured over the facts of the quests etc.<P>I do not see changing AI as an "everchanging world" i do not see making old mobs act differently as an "everchanging world".  I see them as laziness.  If you dont like the way players have found to deal with a situation, make EVERY zone that comes out after that have the new rules in it.  Theres alot of zones that i have heard of that arent in the game but that could be made.  I have heard rumors of an "innoruuk's temple", and of a "warrens", and of a "highkeep cave" or some such zones.  Where are they?  You want to keep yourselves busy?  I see tons of gods that dont have planes of existance.  Work on it.  I see a repition of "kill this, get xp, kill it more".  For a RPG that REALLY sucks.  This IS a role playing game...remember?  Make quests more difficult (some of them), make them less kill oriented.  Make more storyline. That'll keep you guys busy for a while.  If you need people to help with quests, or to help make new zones, you know all of our email addresses.  Send out mail.  I for one would be more than willing to help.  Out of your 80,000 plus subscribers, im sure there are more that are willing to help.  This is my leisure time activity.  I want to make it the best it can be.<P>I see nerfing stuff as a cop out.  I understand that you must keep things new and exciting, and difficult to keep your players happy.  I understand that the day one single character gets so powerful they can do everything easily is the day you have failed.  I dont understand why you have to nerf already existing things when you can just make new content.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Most of the posters explaining the problems have been talking about 55+ mobs and raid scenarios.  It's nice to know if you stick with easy experience camps, you can find a way to survive as a healer.  <P>Please take a moment next time to try and understand the real problem before you post comments totally unrelated to the real issues.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

We always had the chance of the monster aggroing on us during a heal, but they just made it much worse now.<P>Any cleric in his right mind who thinks this change is ok either is an idiot, or is extremely fortunate and has jboots to do the normal Druid Kiting routine.<P>There has to be a 100 to 1 ratio of people who hate this Nerf.

The point here is not that we are absolutely right, but that we don't think it's completely wrong.  There might need to be some tuning done to this change.  But the change itself isn't wrong.  Having monsters nearly ignore the fact that there is a healer restoring the life to its enemies is wrong, both in terms of consistency within the game world and for the mechanics of the AI.<P>Suro wrote:<P>&gt;"1) Encounters involving one or two mobs that are below the 50th level cap."&lt;<P>I just wanted to clear this up.  The 51st level thing is based on the person being healed, it has nothing to do with the level of the NPC.  I just wanted to point this out because so many people have been getting this wrong.<P>Tfodthog Tmfof wrote:<P>&gt;"CH is a 10k heal it doesnt check the amount of points the target needs and only send that.

So the logic posted on your "PATCH" is broken. Is the logic in your Code?"&lt;<P>Actually, you are incorrect.  The maximum healing of the spell is never looked at, only the points actually healed.<P>LetoII wrote:<P>&gt;"Absor, this is just sad. You've stated that the change was made because clerics were bored with the old heal/med routine."&lt;<P>No, I didn't.  This change was made because healing was being almost ignored by the NPCs.  The mechanic was broken.  I've never said anything about this being done as something to make a cleric's life more interesting.<P>Renic_TdS wrote:<P>&gt;"I think the main problem we have is that the Verant of today seems very reluctant to say: <BR>"We made a mistake" <BR>or <BR>"Hmm maybe the change isnt in the interest of those who pay our wages" <BR>They are terrified of saying anything like: <BR>"We are going to changes things back to the way we were because we were wrong, and its what our customers want" &lt;<P>Not at all.  If we make a mistake we are not afraid to apologize for it.  And we are always looking out for the game as a whole.  But we are not in the position where we can just respond to every customer request by doing as asked.  What we do for one customer has the potential to affect all customers.  So, unfortunately, we have to say no to some customers, especially when their request would adversely affect other customers.<P>Making the game the better is in the best interest of all customers.  When making changes to game mechanics that don't work properly, that's what we have to consider as out first priority.  The only thing that I can tell you right now is that we are looking at the effects of this change.  If something needs to be changed to make the game better, we'll do it.<P>&gt;"Im quite passionate about this, and normally I jus sit and read quietly and dont get involved.

Pathing being one of the major ones that comes to mind. Now with that statement I'm positive you're all going to put your little heads together and fix them ALL yes? But I pray when you do it you actually do a thorough test and determine exactly how the fixes will affect all aspects of the game and take those into consideration cause you failed miserable at doing that on this 'fix'."&lt;<P>Well, there is a difference between a broken game mechanic and a technological problem.  Bad pathing is not a problem with the game mechanic, it's a problem with the execution of that mechanic.  That doesn't mean that such things shouldn't be fixed, I just wanted to be as clear as possible on my point.<P>As for not seeing all of the long range repercussions of this change, that's always possible.  In a way, it's not being able to see far enough out that probably caused healing aggro to be way too low for all this time.<P>ciberido wrote:<P>&gt;"To claim that the whole issue is merely people overreacting, and thus to dismiss so high-handedly the claims made by people who have played their clerics and have died because of the nerf, however, is a slap in the face."&lt;<P>That isn't my claim.  As I have said, there may indeed be an issue in certain situations, and we are looking at that.  But there is an undeniable affect that happens with things like this.  There is a snowball thing, one person claims that something has been done to make something really bad and before others have even tried it out, they are agreeing and insisting that it be 'fixed'.  This becomes a problem for us.  We need feedback on the game.  This sort of thing, however, is not feedback, it is misinformation.<P>All I was saying was that if people want to provide feedback, please do so.  We're reading as many of these posts as we can.  But posting something that basically says, 'I haven't even played since the change, but the change is bad', isn't very convincing as feedback.<P>Keep posting your experiences, we are reading them.  And we are certainly aware of your concerns.  We are looking at all of this keeping your responses in mind.  I'll keep you informed about any decisions we make.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have only been playing my cleric a short time but lately have noticed every time i am ina group the mob will attack me first =). for it second it puts the monster on my hate list cuase nowhe has pissed me off. But then i get to thinking about it man this guy is smart. When we attack a monster that has healers as his back up what do we do get rid of his healers first so now we have a better chance of killing it. In this case the mob is doing the same thing he wants to kill us first since he knows we will heal the guy and the monster will never hurt our tank. If it is a fairly good group the warrior or tank will hit him so much to where the mob will think geez i cant kill the healer if this tank is hiting me i should kill him first maybe then i can kill the healer. well he gets the tank almost dead and we go in a cheal the tank now we really pissed him off cuase now he thinks *** i almost friggin had that dude and this friggin cleric had to go and heal him now i am really pissed at him so i should kill him but then the tank is still there taunting and kicking the crap out of him to where he is almost dead and the monster says crud i am really messsed over not only can i not kill the tank i cant kill the healer either i better flee maybe i can get away. To sum it up nicely this was a move to more roleplaying i have played many classes in this game and understand pretty darn good how things agro and as long as you dont do things to piss him off you wont be agrod. but when you go and heal and nuke and hit the guy expect to be hit and expect to be on your toes I mean come on now do you really just wanna sit and med the whole time. I like being hit it makes me feel like i am helping true when i get hit for 200 or so i dont like it have to da or db but hell thats why i have them =) thats why i have ac buffs and good ac i am ment to take a few hits =)<BR>geez <BR>Brendyen <BR>Battle cleric of Cazic- thule<BR>officer Guardians of Darkness<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, the post is hopelessly buried somewhere now, but either you or Abashi mentioned a discussion with a high level cleric at a fan faire who was bored with the sit/med routine.  That was mentioned in the context of one of the many protest threads against the healing aggro change.  That's where I got the idea that one of the reasons for the change was to somehow make a cleric's life more interesting, which obviously it doesn't do unless death is more interesting. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>While I respect your global desire to improve the product and trust that, in your heart of hearts, that is where you wanted to go... this change was dramatic in effect and modifies a fundamental element of the game.  I hope you will agree that it is rather late in the process to make sweeping changes to the game... and this is a sweeping change.<P>You have stated clearly that you felt the hate from healing was "broken" before.  Well, I'm intrigued by this implication.  If this is true, then most healers should not have experienced agro-ing from healing... yet I can state unequivocably that EVERY healer I know has experienced agro from healing, of varying degrees.  They way it was working before, hate list management was a skill all clerics learned and, by their later levels, had largely mastered.  This meant that it was less of an issue for their mental game since it became almost second nature.  To replace it, mana and timing management became the order of the day.  Now, the job of a cleric has become dramatically more complex by virtue of having to not only relearn the hate management, but to apply this knowledge constantly as it is a much more difficult juggling act.<P>Perhaps you don't actually perceive the magnitude of this change, but for comparison it is roughly equivalent to, in a game like Quake, suddenly tripling all movement speed of all players (let's ignore the frame rate limitation for sake of this analogy).  The result, of course, would be to greatly widen the gap between the average player and the expert player.  A very few could handle the extreme speed and would become gods... while the great bulk of the rest of us would find the game much harder because of the increased speed.  The hate-list change is similar... now you've made it so the best clerics will be able to overcome the added obstacles, and the rest will be forced to deal with perhaps too many things to juggle.  The result will be some clerics leaving, and some players in general leaving... while a select few are excited by the new challenge.<P>I put it to you that, regardless of the legitimacy of the "fix" on the grounds of repairing a broken mechanic, it does not add to the fun of the game for many players.  For that reason alone, it should be removed.  You have, in this case, made the game more fun for a handful, and a great deal less fun for many.<P>I'm glad you're reading the posts... now, I can only hope you actually listen and think about them.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Who would have thought.<P>Ok...edited to correct the small error he pointed out..<BR>(excerpted from an earlier post in this thread)<P>1) Encounters involving one or two mobs with players that are below the 50th level cap.<BR>The new aggro rules work fine here. This is undoubtably the situation that was being considered when the new rules were designed and 'tested' and they make sense here. Aggro is higher, but manageable amd the encounters are not super deadly.<BR>Solution: None needed, although fixes applied to the following solutions will affect this situation as well.<P>2) Encounters involving many mobs with players that are below the 50th level cap. Note: there are many areas in the world where this situation is unavoidable. Single and double pulling is NOT possible in all areas.<P>The new aggro rules DO NOT work under these conditions. The problem is that a 1000 point heal generates MANY TIMES more aggro than does a 1000 point nuke or 1000 pts of damage. Scenario: Party beats on mob 1, while mobs 2-5 are mezzed, rooted or allowed to beat on tanks. After a while, someone needs a heal (could be the tank, could be the chanter,doesnt really matter). Cleric heals injured person. Mob 1 has cleric elevated to a higher aggro, but this is offset by previous damage. Mob1 _might_ aggro on cleric, but can be taunted/ damaged off. Mobs2-5 ALSO aggro on cleric, but have no offsetting hate list and thus cleric shoots to the top. If they are free to attack, they do so and the party has NO WAY to get them all off. And, even if they do (re-mez, for example)...As they beat on Mob2, a new heal is necessary. But not mobs3-5 have twice the heal aggro they did earlier...Etc. By the time you get to that last mob, it has the cleric on a hate list equivelent to ALL THE DAMAGE THAT THE PREVIOUS MOBS DID (because all that damage had to be healed at some point). This hate list cannot be offset by simple damage or taunting, and can only be offset by mem blur or Atone (and may require MANY atones, as the mobs dont always cooperate in their positioning). Thus, this situation CAN be managed with great difficulty...and if the cleric has to cast several atones, he isnt healing or medding and may not be able to get off the next heal when it is needed. <BR>Essential problem: HEALS ADD TO THE HATE LISTS OF ALL MOBS HAVING RECIPIENT ON THEIR HATE LIST, BUT DAMAGE AND TAUNTS ONLY APPLIES TO THE ONE BEING HIT.<BR>Proposed Solution: Heal adds to aggro, but at a 1:3 ratio. Under this rule, although each heal will add less aggro, as the cleric casts several heals, his aggro on the unengaged mobs will still be going up, resulting in a more dangerous situation for him (which was your goal, no?) while not inflating his aggro as currently occurs.<P><BR>Note:  Changing the post to refer to PLAYERS below 50 from referring to MOBS below 50 did not IN ANY WAY change the significance of the problem.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have tried and tested this issue. Im not a cleric but im am the class that is the only class that can keep in touch with the heat of battle, Warrior. <P>Before the nerf, you actually saw roles in place. Melee'ers were able to take the hit for caster types. Now, you have made it so hard that the majority of the time my cleric goes down i dont even notice it, its almost instantly in the beginning of battle. <P>You talk about tactics to get around this. You say let clerics nuke more or be more offensive. I noticed in the patch that you gave better healing to other classes, good idea. You want the other classes to suck up a little of the healing. But see, thats where you dont get it. There's never enough healing to go around when you need it. It dosent matter if you give everyone a healing spell. Its either going to be moderate where as the clerics can hold the load or, its going to be in the heat of battle and every class sticks to their role...<P>Warriors - Tank and keep aggro<BR>Rangers - Help apply damage and park<BR>Clerics - Heal your ass off<BR>Enchanters - Mez<BR>Necromancers - Feed clerics<BR>Shaman - DoT (usually ends in death anyhow)<BR>Paladins - Help tank and apply stun<BR>Shadow Knights - Back up tank and damage<BR>Druids - Root, charm, DD, AE, Snare, etc.<P>When the sheit hits the fan, you have approximatly 10 seconds to get into role, if you dont your dead, everyones dead. It's like clockwork. You cant nerf clerics healing. You would have to be a moron to consider that. Heres a situation in raids which is common.<P>-L60_mob incomming with puller. <BR>-Puller FD's<BR>-L60_mob goes strait for clerics (why?)<BR>-Cleric gets off invuln and lives for now<BR>-Taunt gets off and mob gets under control<BR>-Massive_dmg_dealer that got taunt is now uber aggroed and is taking fatal dmg.<BR>-Cleric casts CH<BR>-L60_mob bolts for cleric<BR>-Downtime for tanks to locate mob again<BR>-Cleric's start healing the cleric or cleric trys healing himself, in turn, gaining more aggro<BR>-L60_mob bounces around to another cleric or stays on one... either way the next occurs.<BR>-Cleric gets Loading Please Wait message<P>This is a common occurance after the patch. I have witnessed this and raid sized CR's occuring much more often because of the patch. It's over done and needs to be fixed. Either that or you change the tauting for melee back the way it was. Jacking melee'ers ability to gain aggro from procs or the slowness of 2h weapons will not do. It makes the game uncontrolable. To substitute one cleric you will need 3 druid/shaman to make up and that takes 3 key people away from battle. Clerics are vital members. You couldnt even do a raid before without 3 clerics as a minimum. Now your upping the ante to 4-5 minimum. Theres no tactics to solve this less... you just start letting people die.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;Making the game the better is in the best<BR>&gt;&gt;interest of all customers. When making changes<BR>&gt;&gt;to game mechanics that don't work properly,<BR>&gt;&gt;that's what we have to consider as out first<BR>&gt;&gt;priority. The only thing that I can tell you<BR>&gt;&gt;right now is that we are looking at the<BR>&gt;&gt;effects of this change. If something needs to<BR>&gt;&gt;be changed to make the game better, we'll do it.<P>&gt;&gt;And we appreciate your passion, we share it.<BR>&gt;&gt;I would, obviously, prefer to have you stick<BR>&gt;&gt;with us and trust us to do what is best for the game. <BR>                     <P>I have to ask how making encounters that were possible with a well oiled group (or groups) prior to this change no longer feasible makes this game better for its customers.<P>Example:<BR>Velketor the Sorcerer (locacted in Velketors Labrynth (sp?)<P>prior to patch:<BR>group of 36 people (that is before the Linkdeaths -- another issue that can be disccussed elsewhere) go to fight this mob...  the tatic that was used was to have 1 warrior primarily aggro Velk for a good minute before others engaged (thus assuring that even though warrior taunting ability is horrid,  he would still remain the most hated) the 5 clerics we had there rotate heals on the main warrior and its left up to the other people to not aggro (or they die).  there is more to our tactics then this that I will not go into because it doesnt much pretain to this issue.<P>post patch:  (you did ask for examples didn't you?)<P>warrior engages -- gets good and beat down but still gets pretty well hated... this time we try using your new super druid-as-healer strategy that you were so sure would solve everything, anyways druids healed the warrior for just a bit to let him build even more aggro before cleric spells hit.  Cleric casts CH and &lt;splat&gt; cleric dies.  well we had a backup plan in case CH wasn't a valid spell any more.  Next our clerics cast the "lesser" heals while others engage - and lo and behold, the clerics aren't aggrod but soon are out of mana from the constant mana dumping into the tanks. <P>I realize that this is only one example,  but it pretty well describes most (if not all) the high level encounters I have been on since the patch.  What you are calling "new and better" tatics amounts to bigger and lamer lemming rushes to kill mobs.  <P>It would seem that actually coming up with ways to kill mobs using 2 or 3 (or even 5) groups goes against the vision... instead you must just throw 100 people and pray to the connection gods that enough stay connected to overwhelm your opponent.<P>I didn't play for 2 years to be reduced to a lemming tank -- which in the so called "epic" fights is all I am now.  Rather then just healing me its now faster to start the fight -- get 1 heal,  die and be ressed back out of the way - healed again and re-engage then it is to Complete heal me (thus splatting the clerics).  I ask how this fits in the "vision(tm)" . . .<P>if you respond by saying "well Laodorf you just need to get more clerics to accompany you" I will respond to that ahead of time:<BR>most of the high level clerics are or have already quit.<P>and even if we have more there -- then more die or we can res people in faster to continue the fight of attrition rather then tatics.<P>I have to say that this patch was the most unjustified, game ruining patch that you have all put in yet.  I know I (and hundreds of others on my server alone) will be leaving EQ as soon as another title hits the shelves... up until this point I was planning on staying on as a loyal Everquest player long after your competition realeased new titles and such.. just because there were still things to kill and things to see for me in this game.  Now there isn't, killing the high-end mobs is just stupid (if I wanted to just hit stuff and die alot I would play quake) and without those at level 60 your game is lame.<P>Was "fixing" somthing that you have left in game for 2 years just so that a tiny percentage of folks at the highest levels of gameplay can't kill 1 or 2 mobs the way they have been (because when it comes down to it.. thats what you are reacting too...) worth making the game hugely less enjoyable for the rest of your customer base?<P>Or why don't you actually hire the folks in Da`kor and Fires of Heaven to do your testing for you to save all the rest of us the headache of learning a new game when they outsmart your designers.  /boggle<P>-Laodorf, 60th warlord<BR>170 playing days<BR>&lt;Storm's Fury&gt;<BR>Erollisi marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I run 2 accounts at the same time, Shaman, and Cleric, since it is difficult to find a Cleric to group with depending on what area you are in. Mostly in DL around Karnors Castle now. Don't have Uber equipment, haven't done any Uber MOBS. But have played my Cleric every night since "fix", luckily I have a regular friend who plays a Druid, and have noticed if my Cleric casts anything over Greater Healing, he's been getting jumped more, hehe, my Shaman, and Druid friend spend time having to heal Cleric in order to keep him alive. His defensive and offensive skills are weak at best, heck, he's a Cleric, not meant to take a whole lot of damage, and far from being a Tank. I mostly play EQ for fun, not to get the best equipment, or to kill the baddest MOBS in game, just to have "FUN" I think thats what most of us pay for. Now that things will be more aggro on the Cleric, do we also need to raise our defensive skill cap? Or count on DA to save us every 15 minutes? I love EQ because of the friends i've made, and not claiming i'm going to quit, not going to flame a soul. But I can see both viewpoints in this issue. But I think as some others that have posted here is, all these changes, and more changes, as we are just getting used to last changes? Hehe, my late Father told me, you can always count on Death, Taxes, and Change. But this is a game that 90 percent of us play for fun, not for anyone elses "Vision" that we players are footing the bill to do so. All i'm saying is maybe some change may be good, but too much change, is just getting to be something we "HAVE" to get used to in EQ.

</FONT><HR>Alan, I would like to respond to your earlier reply to my comment.<P>You indicate that you do in fact realize the problems this has created for the high-end encounters. With all due respect, let me strongly suggest that in the future Verant should get extensive player input before any modification so wide in its scope is made to the game. Much of the product I have bought is now unplayable because of this change - and I have a character of ideal class and level for these top encounters. For those with less ideal characters the situation is much worse.<P>You should also be aware that the current state of many mobs is as it is because of the limitations of the AI. Now that you have improved the AI you must re-examine the power levels of the mobs since they were tuned to a poorer AI. Specifically the things you should be looking at are the magic resistance levels that restrict strategies to melee only, the damage output of mobs that forced players to rely on complete heal, and the hitpoints and regeneration of mobs, especially but not only boss mobs. Velious in particular is inflated in these respects, and this is a prime opportunity to reverse the trend of mudflation by toning this expansion down. <P>Another point I would like to bring to your attention is the trend I see of catering to level 60 players. For level 60 areas this is fine. For areas which previously catered to the level 50 crowd this is not fine. I am referring here to the changes on Test that reportedly increase the difficulty of the planes of Hate and Fear. The 47-53 crowd is severely restricted in the number of places they can adventure, and Karnor's Castle gets boring after a while.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I can't say I have read EVERY post on this subject and all I can say is this.<P>Everytime I go away for a few weeks, I come back and they have moved my desk and changed my job.<P>I have played 1 hour since the patch (and I don't even know when that accually was) and found no real problems, but that does not matter, cause where I was fighting was not an area that seems to be affected.<P>I am going to be terrified to go on any raids now, thanks Verant.  As for your excuses for why this kind of change (provided it is all true, can't say as I have been away for the last 2-3 weeks) is a good thing, all I can say is "go **** yourselves".  Never have a heard more full of it excuses for totally ******* an entire class.<P>I am a 55 cleric, I HATE dieing, almost as much as I hate watching somebody die.

Boom, we get a shock one day on login after a patch. <P>I just don't get you guys.

</FONT><HR>Absor, you focused on my example (which may or may not have been a bad one) and not on my point.  But that's fine.  My point was that if you are so concerned about broken mechanics then I would hope you now have a pretty hefty list of other things to fix within your game that have also been there and broken since beta.  But honestly I don't think that's the case.  <P>For whatever reason Verant choose to focus on this one issue and insisted it absolutely had to be 'fixed'.  And honestly I fail to see it being that much of a problem simply because you have proceeded to design around how cheal/agro _was_ with no apparent hesitation at all.<P>And in applying this 'fix' Verant neglects to retune areas that where designed with you knowing what the status of cheal/agro was... <P>Now tell me truthfully do you not see the folly in that approach and the potential for players to react negatively which is exactly what we have now?<P>And honestly with all the very informative recounts of ingame experiences behind this 'fix' I can't help but wonder why in the world aren't you guys taking more of a positive stance on correcting this issue or at least in saying wait maybe we should test it more?  Why not reverse this part of the patch and take it to Test with some pet testers and do a more thorough evaluation of it's affects?  When you finish you can post the results and implement what is necessary.  That would go a long long way towards showing your customers that yes you admit something could be wrong and you are listening and you do want to make sure what you put on the live servers will not adversely affect the game.<P>Instead you're doing... what?  Letting your players on the live servers do your testing for you while you run interference on the boards.<P>real nice...<P>Just my opinion<P>Morgian<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&lt;&lt;There is a snowball thing, one person claims that something has been done to make something really bad and before others have even tried it out, they are agreeing and insisting that it be 'fixed'. This becomes a problem for us. We need feedback on the game. This sort of thing, however, is not feedback, it is misinformation.&gt;&gt;<P>So it's the ones who have repeatedly said that they've tried it and it sucks that are providing misinformation?  Define misinformation.  I've read post from a whole lot of Clerics and even other classes that have repeatedly provided specific problems with this change.  I've also seen numerous posts from Clerics who have said that this change did not effect thier specific circunstances.  Could it possibly be that both are right?  Ya think?  I pretty sure that any change made to the game isn't going to effect EVERY circumstance, but it seems that this particular change has caused problems with some of the game and you seem to be completely ignoring that fact.<P>So what I'm getting here is that as long as we go along with what you've already decided is the correct response (i.e. Hail Verant, thay can do no wrong!) we are providing misinformation and not actually trying this stuff in-game.  According to your statement, only the minority on these issues would be correct in thier findings.  All the other opinions are incorrect because of the 'snowball effect'.  That's a pretty convenient theory to dismiss all the people here who are telling you that this change has caused some major problems in some areas of the game.<P>I'm sure there are alot of people, just like me, who don't actually play this game at all.  We just come here and post because we have nothing better to do.  We really don't know anything about this game.  As a matter of fact, I don't even have a computer.  Don't ask me how I'm posting here.<P>Like I said before, why bother asking for feedback if you're just going to ignore it?  This board is a huge waste of time anymore.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Why are you nerfing the clerics ability to heal us? do you (verant) think that clerics are overpowered omopared to other classes? I have yet to meet someone who would say that clerics should be nerfed of anything. I have always been grateful to all the clerics (except those special few jerks) I have ever met and had dealings with. As a matter of fact i think you should buff the clerics up a bit and give them new interesting spells. I have never felt envious of the clerics and the job they do, I couldn't do it. I think it's hard enough trying to keep whole party of warriors alive without this neat little added effect of having the mobs ftrenzy on them evertime they cast a spell. Now there's going to be scores of people who die for the single fact that the cleric is afraid to heal them. Also think about this, when a cleric dies....who ressurrects the cleric?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

There was already a hate heal on clerics and all healing class's And they just made it Worse then ever. Before we could take 40-50 no guilded people walk into VoX and slay. Now it takes about 70+ because why? Clerics die almost right away. Tanks cannot dish out enough damage in time to get cleric off hate list and the first thing a cleric has to cast is CH on a tank. Me being a warrior with over 4k in hp and godly stats that can dish out thousands of dmg on a dragon can in no way keep up with this lame ass thing verant has added.

</FONT><HR>I play a 43 cleric (now 44).  I spent about 10 hours in Dreadlands after the patch.<P>My observations so far:<BR>If I could get our warrior buffed enough (by either myself or others), he would have enough time (live long enough) to obtain sufficient aggro on the mob so that if I needed to CH, it wasn't too bad.<P>Certain lower AC tanks (eg, rangers, rogues) were harder, and caused me many problems.  So I went back to SH but that wasn't enough in some cases vs. Drolvargs.  The result was I got aggro'd like an over-zealous nuker, taking the tanks 3 good taunts to get the mob off me.  I nearly died a couple of times if not for Divine Aura.<P>Once I hit 44 and loaded up Celestial Healing it was much easier (it seemed), but not every cleric has access to that spell.<P>So, I think if you lowered the hate *slightly* it would be a good balance.  If one half-dead Drolvarg is enough to rip through me after one CH, something seems wrong.<P>Kosa</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 9 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061314-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=061314&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=061314&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
