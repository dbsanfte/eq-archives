</FONT><HR>Absor, I believe the main problem with the Magician balance, is that Verant does not listen.<BR>Mages have many complaints, listed over and over on these boards, yet you come back to us saying we are balanced. <BR>Here are a couple of examples of how little the "team" at verant pays attention to the Magician.<P>1) We are the main pet class. The pet class, supposedly with the toughest pets. Pets are supposed to be our defining power. Yet more classes than not have pets now, including some tough ones, that you just added to the druid and shaman classes. <P>2) You have problems with spreading powers from one class to another, yet other classes get our high level spells built into their armors. Thieves summon throwing knives, and Monks get a 55 spell for summoning shuriken. When was the last time you gave a level 55 Necro DoT to a monk?<P>3)You protect druids by giving them illusion:wolf, protect necros by giving them illusion:spectre, saying that those illusions are the domain of those classes, yet Magicians don't get illusion:elemental, instead you say those are the domain of the enchanter. When was the last time you saw an enchanter summon an elemental, or cast an elemental nuke?<P>4) Our items are pretty lame. Look at all the posts about multiple high level items having "reclaim energy" as their effect, or look at one of our high level boots, it summons bandages. Come on, bandages are a 15 mana spell, why would a magician want boots that summon that?<P>The prime example of Verant not caring about Magicians is the Epic quest. For months Magicians complained about the Pegasus Cloak being no drop. When we finally got a response, it was from a guy who didn't care enough to read the posts, since he told us to "buy a cloak".<P>Magicians have concerns, please care enough to protect our class in the same way you have protected others. Give our class upgrades where we need them, stop giving our class defining abilities to other classes. Do not think that when you fix a DD or Rain spell effect for wizards, that you have also taken care of the Magician problems. We have our own problems. Stop thinking that you need to balance the Magician class by not changing us, when you give all of our capabilities ot other classes.<P>Do not think that when you are balancing the classes, that you don't need to have a Magician thread, like you do for EVERY OTHER CLASS. And then add our thread as an afterthought, right before the deadline to finish the threads up.<P>Care about us, the same way you care about druids or necros or enchanters.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, <P>I hope you read this far and read this post for the honest attempt it is.<P>I know that Most of VI will balk as giving Mages some sore of mana regen.  But here's an idea that may make mages more Group frienly, and actually have something good to trade for Sow, CLarity etc...<P><BR>lvl 16 Summon Channel shard<P>200 mana, 8.0 casting time, 10.0 recovers<P>Summons a lore  item that has 2 charges of  Minor channeling.<P>Minor channeling Does this.  recudes casting time on any spell by 10 to 16%  or 10% + 1 % for every 10 levels.<P>1% per every 10 level mana reduction on any spell cast so at 60 there is a mana reduction is 6% on all spells cast.  i.e.  a 500 mana spell would then take 470 mana<P>Duration same a breeze<P>Level 29<P>Summon Stone of channeling<P>has 2 + 1 charge for ever 20 levels. so at 60 will have 5 charges. lore tradable. <P>Charges are of channeling channeling Does this.  recudes casting time on any spell by 10 to 22%  or 10% + 2 % for every 10 levels.<P>2% per every 10 level mana reduction on any spell cast so at 60 there is a mana reduction is 12% on all spells cast.  i.e.  a 500 mana spell would then take 440 mana<P>Duration same a Clarity<P>Last one  <P>summon orb of channeling<P>has 2 + 1 charge for ever 20 levels. so at 60 will have 5 charges. lore tradable. <P>Charges are of  Greater channeling. <BR>Greater channeling Does this.  recudes casting time on any spell by 10 to 30%  or 10% + 2 % for every 6 levels.<P>2% per every 6 level mana reduction on any spell cast so at 60 there is a mana reduction is 20% on all spells cast.  i.e.  a 500 mana spell would then take 400 mana<P>Duration and level same a Clarity II<P>I don't think this would be any more overpowering than clarity  instead of increasing mana regeneration, it increases mana efficiency (sp), and would be a great compliment to the enchanters clarity line in groups and on raids.  I also do not think it would be anymore overpowering than the clarity line.  If need be make all of the summoned item no drop so the mage has to either summon one or carry it in his inventory to use on other players.<P>anyway its just an idea.  Hope you get something useful out of it.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR> One thing I'd really like to see(and I know it's possible) that doesn't affect the balance at all, but would make the class more interesting is to make the following improvement to the Phantom series of spells:<P>-Give the Phantom Spells an illusion effect to make the mage look as if he's wearing a full suit of the armor in question. There's no race that can be a magician that doesn't have leather, plate, and chain textures.. Maybe tint it so you can tell it's summoned or some such.. Granted, maybe this effect should be optional, because from what I know, phantom spells are very often used, and this would change the whole look of the class.. some people would want to show off their cool robe but not want to forsake the AC bonus, etc. A solution to changing the look of the class would be for the armor to overwrite everything but the robe graphic, so it'd look like you were wearing full plate under a robe(very neat looking I think), or full plate completely if not wearing a robe(most people do, so it wouldn't drastically change the look of the class). You may or may not want to include a helm graphic.<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, I apologize if i repeat something, I have very little time to post to these boards and less time to thouroghly read them (maybe if -I- got paid to read..) Anyway, I have a few short ideas.<BR>1) Would love to see some new summoned items with target specific procs.<BR>2)Pets do not back off fast enough. They usually get hit again while they are attempting to back off resulting in their re-engaging the mob.<BR>3)A command to make the pet not help you -even- if you are getting hit. This is helpful if your pet is resting and you get hit randomly in the melee. The enchanter can then mez the guy that hit you but not if your pet shouts out "Here I come to save the day Master!"<BR>4)Pets have a set delay, yet still auto-equip the weapon with the lowest delay. Can you fix it so that pets just take whatever the most recent item you gave them even if it has a higher delay than one you previously gave them? Example: Say im level 4 and i give my pet a rusty long sword with a base damage of 6 and delay of 35 (making up numbers) This would cause the pet to hit for a max of 14.  Later on I pick up a rusty scythe from a orc pawn. It has a damage of 8 and a delay of 46.  It would let my pet hit for a maximum of 18 (alot of damage at level 4), however, if I give him the weapon, he eats it because the delay on the rusty long sword is faster. If I want him to use the scythe I have to make a new pet, which is quite expensive for a newbie magician with no rich friends (resulting in all the newbie beggers) Also, to expand the current example, if somebody else walks along they can ruin my nice scythe wielding pet by handing him a rusty dagger with a damage of 3 and a delay of 23. Now my pet has a wimpy dagger that I didnt even want him to have and he hits for some wimpy amount like 6 or maybe 8 if his natural damage for that level pet is higher (i cant remember what a level 4 pet hits for). Please do something about this.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>well heres my 2 cents.( hopefully verant listens )<P>pre 50 i feel magi's are just about perfect.  fix a few pet issues and i don't see any problems.<P><BR>where you get a magi as being a solo machine is beyond me but hey if you like killing then sitting for 10mins be my guest.<P><BR>the problem with magis is post 50.  post 50 the power of NPCs and all other classes go way up. Except for the magicians.  <P>my pet is barely stronger than the 49 pet.  <P>my spells do barely anymore dmg.  <P>i thought the magi was supposed to be pure offense.  where is my offense. <P>i thought that verants whole reason for not giving magis defense was there above par offense.<BR>with velious and kunark mobs being as strong as they are i'm not even an annoyance to most of them.<P>if you don't believe me i'll let you play my 57 magi for a few nights just to see how bad it gets.<P>how bout giving my pets more hps, and more dmg.<BR>hell at 57 if my pet hit for 100 everytime most of the mobs i fight would still tear me a new one.<BR>i'm not asking to wipe warriors with my pet alone i'm just asking to atleast be on par with warriors, imean just like a warrior our only job in life is to make stuff dead, yet i'm at best mediocre at it.<P>oky back to those spells. come on Verant. give me some punch.<P>my 52/58 pets not only hit like school children but cast wimpy spells which because of the rotation of the spells don't really interrupt.  <P>rage of zomm, i like the idea of the pet but it dies almost as soon as i cast it.<P>decoy -- weak meelee and doesn't decoy anything.<P>54 water pet well uhmm hehe where is it.<BR>muzzle of mardu, velocity couple others same problem<P>the elemental illusion suggestion is kinda cool. would be nice if we got the pets abilities and could meelee like them.<P>summoned items hmm well they've been pretty useless so far no reason to change. keep em give me some offense.<P>how bout making coh interzone. or giving us an upgrade.<P>voice graft would be cool for the fun effect.<P>/pet ignore attack -- please put that in. can't tell you how many times i've had to apoligize for getting a group wiped because the mob Goes after the pet.  and don't think i haven't noticed the code making mobs attack pets so they can't be mez'd.<P>group dmg shield -- hello my group is me, my pet then those other 5 ppl. i am a magician don't you think i'd prob think of my pet before i think of the others.<P>hey another thing bind wound, you ever wonder why the class that can make infinite bandages can bind wounds better.<P>well theres my 2 cents. hope someone listens<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Here are some of my ideas (new and old), which I feel are well balanced and would make wonderful additions to the game:<P>-----------<BR>NEW SPELLS (Item summons and others)<BR>-----------<BR>1- Wand of Capture: Summons a wand that when held (with mouse, just like identify) and a spell is cast it will absorb that spell into itself with 1 charge. It would allow up to 5 charges after which it says "This item is not capable of absorbing anymore charges". This therefore would allow the preservation of mana and allow others (like enchanters) to loan out their spells. From a technical standpoint this is alright because the enchanter has "imbued" this wand with his mana and his knowledge, which would otherwise have been used on a player. The spell that has been attached to the wand may be cast now without eating mana but it would still take just as long to cast as if it were coming straight from Imbuer of the item. Best implementable as LORE, level 51-56. Afterwards there would be a possible upgrade, which allows for storage of up to 10 charges. Would also need to be made not to absorb Epic Spells or spells 55 and up do to the sheer strength of the magic involved.<P>Hand of the Forager- Works like Forage and uses Conjuration skill as the limiting factor. Summons items available to Forage depending on the zone. Might cost 5 mana per cast and a recast time same as Forage. Ideal for level 34 or 39.<P>Rod of Modulation- Currently this spell is useful but it isn't very efficient for the magician. It can't be fobbed off as a means of instant mana because it costs more mana than it gives back so my idea is to toss another charge (so it would have 2 charges) where it's use would be much greater in groups and allow the mage to sacrifice health for mana and actually get something out of it for themself.<P>Wand of Far Sight- Summons a wand that offers a bonus of +35 mana and only wieldable by pure casters (Mag, Enc, Nec, Wiz) and would allow a spells distance modifier to be boosted by 10-20 feet. *I’m not sure if this is possible, but I’ve NEVER seen this idea suggested.. may just be my failure to see, but I think this would be a decent effect. It’s not asking for a spell haste.. just the ability to cast a little bit further as long as you hold it either of your melee slots.*<P>Bristlebane’s Bundle- The Spinning Bottle needs to be EXPENDABLE as do Fireworks. Instant-destroy them once they are used. They are already NO RENT, it’s not like you can hold onto them forever.<BR>--<BR>Essence of Stone- summons a stone that when held in range slot or melee slots forms the wielder into an earth elemental. (Mage-only NO DROP) the stone grants all the benefits so the form being taken as well as +4 int, +5 sta, and +15 sv poison and disease and is activated when worn.<BR>-This is one of my old ideas and there is one for each element. The form is permanent as long as this is worn around the neck or held in a hand or something. We would receive these at the same level we receive our Greater Voceration pets. (so this would be scribable at 57).<P>Greater Ring of Flight- Summons a ring that when worn provides Levitation. Effect is broken when the ring is removed or when the player logs. (This would be a possible solution to the Ring of Flight we get at 39 having only 2 charges). Alternatively the ring would have around 10 charges.<P>Eye of the Elements- Summons a range slot item that offers +2 to all stats, +5 to all resistances, and has a See invis/Ultravision combo that is activated by wearing (there has to be some sort of spell like that, and if there is not then there needs to be one).<P>Claw of the Elements- Summons a claw of around 7 dmg/22 delay that procs something like Shock of Blades (35 dmg) and offers +10 sv magic. None/None (pet-only)<P>Shard of the Core- please remove the NO DROP component of this item so that it’s useable by everyone. It’s just not fair that we have this useful item (though it’s RANGE slot instead of AMMO) and not be able to share it.<P>Call of the Hero- I would like to see this useable from any zone based on group target.<P>Gathering of the Heroes- This would be attainable at level 60 and would summon the entire party from any zone. If you don’t make CotH summon from any zone it is imperative that if you would please consider this idea, that you make it summon from any zone. Wizards are able to send their group back to their bind spots and magicians should be able to summon them back. At level 60 this would be highly useful and make raids much easier to organize and get started.. not necessarily make the raid easier to run though. It would use a Black Pearl as a component)<P>These are types of spells that I would like to see added/changed in the mage class. I feel that all of these spells are balanceable and if they aren't used as is, then hopefully they can invoke some ideas for spells along the same lines.<P>Spell Bolt pathing could use a bit of work. If you gave it a fixed height above the surface then it wouldn’t smash into hills or be caught by bugs where physical terrain that is not in the way somehow absorb the bolt (for example looking over the hill top but the bolt vanishes even though it’s cast higher then the top) It’s also be nice if it had a little bit smarter pathing so that it would move somewhat if there is a player or other NPC in the way (but the move would be slight) so that it can reach it’s intended target. This pathing has been ignored for sometime and forgotten but I feel that it needs to be looked into.<P>Mages are forced to choose between Conjuration (pets and DDs) and Evocation (DDs) and it’s not very fair for us to have to choose. We are not Evoking flame, we are Conjuring flame. It might be fire and would generally be tossed under the Evocation category but it’s equally feasible for a magician to summon fire or ice or wind and send it forth in an offensive manner..<P>Which moves me to ask why we are called the “Masters of the Elements” when we don’t even control Earth, Ice, or Air other than in the form of pets. I would like to see some of these spell types added, if even just a few because it would open doors for mages, which are at the moment closed.. They would be no more efficient in dmg or mana cost than our existing spells but they would allow us more leeway when it comes to raids and such and it would help establish that we truly are masters over the elements because as of now we are only masters of fire.<P>-----------<BR>PETS<BR>-----------<BR>First off, you say that the 53 and 59 pets are Monks? If they are then why is it that the 53 version has a capped hit of around 56 (where earth was 58) and chances for summoning higher-level pets is rather low? The biggest killer for me about these "monks" is that they do not have any monk-specific moves (kicks or punches.. not even low ones) and so this pet is pretty much a weaker version of the 51 earth pet that casts Stun instead of Root.<BR>(It's not a BAD pet like the post 50 fire pets, but it's just bad enough that I prefer to use another pet over it.. and frankly I think that the master of the pet should always be able to see the pet if it is invisible) If you give it the role of the monk like it was announced (I do believe everyone assumes this to be a monk based off a statement from Verant) so it can do some of the minor kicking/punching special moves then I think I'd be more moved to use this pet.)<P>Pet commands do not work on the Z-axis like they do on the X and Y-axis. If you would please up the distance on the Z-axis so that pets respond the same as they would if you were on the same level with them that'd be wonderful.<P>Here is a new idea that would be really sweet:<BR>/pet defensive<BR>/pet offensive<BR>/pet normal<P>If you tell the pet to go defensive it's ac jumps up massively and damage output goes down accordingly. It would be useful for situations where the mob the mage is fighting is a high-dmg hitter but has a weakness for the mages spells. Turning on defensive would allow the pet to last longer, allowing the mage to cast longer and possibly do more damage over time if a dmg shield is on the pet. It's usefulness for grouping would be astounding if the magician is the only tank in the group (meaning the pet is the acting tank and you have a group of healers and casters) where the casters and healers can do their job and a low dmg, high ac pet is tanking.<P>On the other side of the spectrum telling the pet to be offensive would raise the dmg output and lower the ac causing much more dmg to be taken in but also have a lot more dmg put out. This would be useful for when the mage has exhausted his mana supply and needs a last ditch effort to try to take the mob down. <P>The usefulness of this idea to the mage class would be IMMENSE and amazing. It would not overpower our class in general aspects unless having a choice in the way our pets fight gives us more power than intended (I suggest testing this idea out and seeing if it’s really overpowering or not because if it’s a feasible idea then not only would this be an incredible new addition to the game but it would give pet casters a whole new means of strategizing the uses of their pets.<P>Also pets gobble up our exp in solo and in groups however they are not recognized as actual members of the group. They cannot be targeted using group commands nor can they be buffed using group buffs so why would they be eating our exp if they are not an actual member of the party. To be fair I think that one of the two should happen:<P>1)	Allow pets to be buffed by group spells and add the double-f# key feature for targeting group members to allow for targeting pets.<BR>2)	Remove the exp penalty from pets.. if they cannot benefit from the group in ways of spells they should not benefit from exp.<P>Monster Summoning Line: This line is pretty much based on the concept of “My pet looks cooler than yours” because it has the same functionality as other pets just random. So it’d be nicer if as you progressed from 1 to 2 the better models that appear on the stronger mobs appear more often than the low ones (spiders, rats, etc..) And when you reach the peak of monster summoning (MS3) you should rarely have to deal with the simple spider and rat models and see more of the Cyclops, Griffin, and Golem type models.. because they simply are more fun to have as pets than a tiny mouse. A possible alternative is to target a mob and by studying it you can create a replica of it. That gives us more control over the spell and saves a ton on malachite casting so I would rather see it this way than the random way, but I’ll be happy with either.<BR>Another thing with Monster Summoning 2 (not sure about three yet) is that it should not be summoning tiny versions of the monsters it summons anymore. They need to be at least equal with the size used in that zone.. and Monster Summoning 3 should make them a tad bit larger than they are (unless it’s a giant model in which case it’s already at it’s max)<P>Epic Pets, people want them to look unique. I agree that the nasty air pet look is already OLD and annoying. A golem look would be nice or something new.. something different.. like the Skyplane pets.. Something that screams “I am unique.. I am powerful.. I am of EPIC quality not only in stats but also in appearance.. please.. no more applause”<BR>Heh if you can visualize something that is like that then YES! You have already begun on making the Epic pet not only sweet to use but also sweet to look at. (let me help you a bit by directing you towards the golems of Chardok, the golems found in the Hole, Nektulos, etc.. when designing/remodeling a model for this pet if you choose to do so.. and mages are praying that you do)<P>-----------<BR>EQUIPMENT<BR>-----------<BR>Mostly the complaints amongst mages about equipment are regarding Planes armor and our Epic Quest. Here are my ideas for solving them in a balanced manner:<P>Firstly Planes Equipment.. this would be an AMAZING feature if added to the magician epic quest:<P>Okay let’s say you are an unlucky magician and you have all the pieces to your epic quest but you cannot obtain the Staffs or Crown in order to obtain your epic. So let’s say you want the “Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth”. You would go the Master of the Earth and you tell him “I would like to challenge the Champion of Earth” he would laugh and tell you how foolish you are but tell you the pieces he needs to construct the champion. He would send you forth to obtain 4 pieces (this part shouldn’t be too hard.. the fight ahead will be hard enough but difficulty should stay around the harder of the sub-quests). When you return the 4 pieces he needs to construct the champion of earth he tells you again that you are a fool but he honors you for trying. He then despawns and in his place spawns the Champion of Earth (Level 60 NPC that uses EARTH-based spells only.. so roots, snares, earthquakes.. no heals, no DDs, but he would hit for the same as Innoruuk) The Champion would spawn indifferent so that he’s not a death trap for lowbies and would await his challenger’s force to take him down. When killed he would drop the Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth thus proving your mastery over Earth by defeating its champion and allowing you to finish your sub-quest with the Master of Earth.<BR>You would have similar quests with the Air and Water masters in order to obtain your crown and staff of elemental mastery: water where the NPCs would cast only spells of their element and would be the same level as the mob that drops the item they bear. It would be nice if you tossed some extra items on these NPCs if you like this idea because if you gather this army to take down this Champion it would be nice if they could get some strong Earth based armor or whatever element it is you slay.<BR>This alone would remedy the problems we mages have with our Epics and would make it easier to obtain.. but only in the ways of time, not in the ways of power.. takes the same force to obtain these as it does from where they currently spawn… you just have control over when you get it.. or when you can try.<P>This is the BEST idea I have ever had and I’ve always hated how I “STEAL” the staffs and crown from other creatures.. they proved their mastery somehow now I want to prove mine.. defeating another master does not prove I’m a master of an element.. You should have to defeat the actual element to honorably obtain your rewards of Elemental Mastery and this idea precisely does that.<P>Velious Planes Armors<BR>Robe of Conjuration and it’s quest versions we would like to have Cadeau of Flame.. Absor shows his agreement but for completeness reasons I say it again.<BR>Pantaloons of Conjuration have Burnout 3.. would it be possible to toss Burnout 4 on them? These armors are obviously aimed at the higher level crowd and if Burnout 4 is available at those levels then mages will end up casting Burnout 4 and never use the Burnout 3 effect unless low on mana or they don’t care about their pet.<BR>The Wristband of Conjuration I believe has Reclaim Energy.. we have a TON of items now that have this effect. PLEASE reconsider replacing the effect on this item with a spell such as “Summon Ring of Flight” “Gift of Xev” “Velocity” or some other USEFUL spell that mages will all find useful.<BR>There are other “focus” items that have Reclaim Energy on them.. if you would please consider upping the power of these items or tone down the sheer amount of these items by replacing the effects.<P>Also I have heard Staffs of Elemental Mastery do not affect pets post 50.. if that’s true then please enable them to work on post 50 pets.. if this is false then let us know J<BR>-----------<P>I haven’t listed everything I’ve found that I agree with and if I repeated something I told why I supported it at least.. I hope that my idea for the Epic Quest is, if everything else is rejected, that it may be talked about and considered very highly because it would resolve the issues mages have with the difficulty of obtaining the Orb of the Elements J<P>Btw mages who feel our quest is too hard as is.. it is very hard but you also need to keep in mind that ours in unique.. if you die and cannot recover your corpse.. if you were any other class you would lose your epic and have to do the quest again.. however we are in the lucky standpoint where we can just summon a whole new epic and forget about the old one.. heh that would leave you to be more concerned with your lost armor because you don’t even need to worry about your epic… but hopefully they will like my idea so it will give us all the opportunity to obtain our epic.. not just those lucky enough to be on the raid that slays Inny or gets to the 7th isle of Sky (which can takes DAYS of constant killing)<P>Anyways thanks for reading this major long post but it outlines EVERYTHING I can think of that is an issue to me about my class.. I just hope that some of it helps and reaffirm what others have said and to invoke new ideas where they haven’t before been touched.<P>Argaile Talismar<BR>54 Elementalist of Xev</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Have to say i see alot of negativity on this thread... Thing is I agree with most of it. Of all the classes I play my mage is the highest, but cuases the most resentment towards VI. Mages have been posting suggestions for a long time on whineplay and now that we have own thread you will notice not many responces. Reason is you made alot people mad.<P>Anyways enough complaining...my 2cp  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>1)We need way to regen mana PERIOD.<BR>2)AE spell affecting pet needs fixing please. We only get nuke spells every 10levels in bewteen we get AE. These are worthless unless fighting giants.<BR>3)How about group dmg shields before we so high lev? I like to ds tanks but it takes way to long to do more than one.<BR>4)Are we the masters of elements or conjuration? If its elements, we should get some other forms of DDs. I mean the master of elements wouldnt just use fire. He would use air, water, and earth too. <P>I love my mage but i find myself playing other chars more and more everyday. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One other thing i forgot, Mages really need Root.  I could care less about the upgraded versions, but i dont see why mages have to be the only casting class (not sure abou SKs or rangers) that cant root.  I find it very annoying to have to constantly travel in Kunark with a pet because if something sees through invis jboots are not fast enough to out run and everyone knows a mage without his pet is the weakest class in the game, we are practically defenseless without a pet.  Its kind of pathetic.  So i dont think it would be unbalancing if mages just got root.  I mean necros can snare fear and root.  Whats the harm of just giving mages root.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I think that all the ideas are wonderful and I hope some get implemented...(im sure some will).  But this is my concern as the only reason I really play my mage anymore is for the epic quest and it is nearly complete except, soo..heres my only gripe <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>This is going to be mainly about the mage epic piece staff or elemental mastery earth off of Inny but can be applied to any pieces off and planar god for any class.<P>Here are the problems I see that make the epic quest not "fun" in order of occurance.<P>#1) The gods are on a plane which in itself is not bad but the problems that arise from this are. Getting to a plane is not easy. For example on E'ci each day there is a hate raid (fear is now camped 24/7) and the same people go up on every weeks on their respective days. For person who is not one of these guild/clics it is EXTREMELY difficult to get in. Being reduced to begging raid leaders or their group leaders to fill an empty spot in their limited number of slots is not my idea of epic questing. Now simply planning a raid for hate or fear yourself is possible and is done with "permission" from the usual raid leader for a respective night IF they are taking the night off. So getting up is tough.<P>#2) Inny is up about 70-80 times a year counting weekly spawns and patches. The staff drops about 1/8 times meaning only 10-12 drops a year can be expected. This means only 12 mages a year can complete their epic quest. Now verant wants the quest to be hard so not everyone has the epic. But this is insane when you look at the numbers. At peak time about 50 mages are on E'ci who are 50+ So it is safe to assume at least 150 mages exist on the server who are 50+. This means that LESS than 10% of mages CAN complete their epic. This is not to say actually complete it, they only CAN if they want to spend the time doing the rest. I would say talking to others that the majority (70%) are actively working on the epic. This is totally unfair. This is in no way fun for any mage to have to compete with fellow mages for this extremely limitied item. It is not even fun to see other people get the piece as it is when you see a cleric get his or a rogue get his pieces. Simply because the piece is so rare you feel sorry for the other mages EVEN if you get the item. Getting the staff off of inny is a sad thing! <P>#3) Verant says time+risk=reward. If this is the case then we need some serious adjustments. For example plane raid takes 6-10 hours for hate or fear (maybe more). Now that is ALOT of time and ALOT of risk to get all the way to get all the way to Inny then kill him and get NOTHING. Some mages have done 10+ inny kills first on the list and have not recieved the staff yet. So 80 hours in hate for once piece (won't even mention SK). Going to hate over and over (even with full planar items) just is not fun and not only that it is making the game LESS fun for others.<P>#4) Again each raid bring a limited number of people. On a number of occasions I have seen raids where all the mages going into hate have FULL apothic armor. These mages are taking spaces that others could use to "fun" even if theya re not working on their epics. But instead they have to wait until so and so gets his epic piece so a more spots can open up so they in turn can go. So now not only are YOU waiting for your piece but OTHERS are now waiting as well...and they dont even know you.<P>Solution: It's simple. You MUST increase drop rates to 100% or even better (and still fair) 2 drops per kill per epic. With one drop a kill that is 70 drops a year, which is much more fair to EVERYONE. This would solve all the problems above as people would move on to other things making the planes a better place for everyone.<BR>The mage epic is Still extremely difficult with this adjustment (again SK) where lots and lots of time is invested. Quests should be fun, not down-heartening, and not only fun but POSSIBLE for everyone who is willing to spend the time and risk to do it. Limiting the items is not the way to make happy questers. Making the mobs more difficult to kill or even a longer camp IHMO is fair. But to make a piece SO rare and SO dependent on many different things is not fair.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I've only played a Magician up to 45, so I can't speak very much about the post-50 problems personally.  Still, I think there exist pre-50 problems which need addressing as well.<P>Pet Heal - I usually have this memmed at 45 out of habit, but probably haven't cast it since 35 or so.  It doesn't do anything.  I'm lucky to be at the point where I can still heal about 10% of the pet's health, and THAT'S pretty useless.  Once SoRs was "fixed", mobs started lasting a lot longer and heals were needed.  Overnuking just leads to dead Mages.  Our pets can't live that long hitting for 46 while the bad guys have more hitpoints and hit for 100.  So, soloing at this point is getting to the point of impossible unless I've going against mobs which are BARELY blue (while my Necro friends laugh at me and Fear/Snare yellows and reds).  I need a way to keep the pet alive!<P>Defense - After 45 levels, you get used to having to cast Gate to live.  It's just a fact of Magician life.  Still, that doesn't mean it's RIGHT or BALANCED.  If we have no way to heal the pet and we can't overnuke, we're going to have to get out of there to survive and sometimes JBoots and a zone aren't available.  So, what do we do?  We need a Root/Snare/Fear/ANYTHING spell here.  If you don't want to give us one, give us a way to kill the thing fast!<P>Pets - I don't know how many times I've had Enchanters yell at me for my pet breaking a mezz.  It's not like I TOLD him to attack that thing!  It just so happened that the mob attacked me 5 minutes ago or just then and the pet won't listen to back off.  We need a /pet stop command that stops the pet from doing ANYTHING.  Why can't it take a beating and not fight back?  I do it all the time.  Considering I'm its MASTER, it should probably listen to me.  Furthermore, why do I have to be in hearing range for this thing?  Shouldn't I have some sort of psychic link with MY creation?  I can talk to everyone else in the world from one point (yes, I know this is a functionality point), why not the thing which is CREATED BY my psychic energies?<P>Shard of the Core - it's a nice spell.  It's got +sd and +sp which nothing else we have does.  And it's Ultravision.  BUT, why not AMMO slot?  I don't care so much about the NO DROP part of it, but why not AMMO slot?  Coldstones are AMMO slot and I always have one.  If this is Ultravision and NO DROP, it's basically a self-only upgrade to a Coldstone, so let us put it in the AMMO slot.  I saw someone selling this in EC cheap and didn't bother because I know I'll rarely ever summon one and needn't waste my hard-earned money.<P>LD - Absor, I LOVE the suggestion you put in about making NO RENT items poof on log-IN.  It's genius and saves TONS of time and mana.  Question: would this apply to pets?  I kind of doubt it, but do seem to remember a time when I kept my pet after going LD (though this may be an error on my part).<P>DoTs - When I saw these come out, I thought, "What fun!  Magic-based DoTs!"  Then I learned the truth: there's no real reason to cast it.  I thought that DoTs were supposed to be a trade-off for mana and time for damage over DDs.  This hits for, at tops, as much as SoS, does the same damage approximately, and is an extra second casting time.  Basically, it's a slow-acting SoS.  What's the point?  It's fun to have; that's about it (like most high-level Mage spells apparently).  Shouldn't the DoT have a higher mana cost and a higher damage?<P>Thanks for taking your time to address these things Absor.  We all really appreciate the hard work and research you put into this (as well as the patience).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Currently mages have a very high death rate.  This is in stark contrast to their nearest kin the necromancer class which has an extremely low death rate due to an abundance of defensive spells.<P>Necros also seem to be much more versatile, able to solo with much greater ease than mages in areas with wandering mobs or groups of mobs while also providing more group friendly abilities.  Few people realize how many things necros can do to aid their group, from mezzing mobs to mana transfer and weak healing.  Mages can cast DS and one debuff.<P>Why do mages die so much more than necro? Pets can only taunt one mob at a time.  Once the pet is occupied there is a very high chance that the additional mob will agro on the caster.  Necros deal with this by using harmshield, shadowstep, fear, screaming terror, lifetaps that restore hps, snares that allow them to escape mobs, and finally a fiegn death spell.  When an additional mob attacks a mage while pet is occupied we are limmited to trying to nuke one of the mobs to death before we die, or running around till our pet finishes the first mob, or gating.<P>The problem with the first two options is that your pet may die while you nuke or run around leaving you with two angry mobs and no taunter, you may perma agro a mob so that it wont leave you alone even when pet comes to taunt, or most probably you will just get your ass kicked first.<P>If you gate you end up abandoning the battle, thus losing experience you spent time/health/mana on and lose your pet.  You also potentially gate far from your hunting group and waste a lot of time getting back to fighting.<P>Many necro options allow the necro to finish the battle or escape from the battle with minimal downtime.  Screaming terror or fear can be used to put the additional mob on hold, or the mob can be snared while the necro runs ahead of it with no fear of taking damage.  Because necros use DoTs they dont have to be constantly casting DDs to help their pet win battles.  While they are running around DoTs and the pet are quickly taking down the first mob.  The necro can even use harmshield to go invulnerable for a time while pet finishes the first mob.  If the necro FDs they are at least still in the same area.<P>Basically I am trying to illustrate that necros are certainly on par with mages in terms of soloing an grouping abilities.  I would even say necros have a pretty good edge on mages.  Why then is is balanced for mages to experience a death rate 4-5 times higher than necros?<P>Please either figure out how to cut our death rate or make our abilties and pets badass enough to warrant such a severe indirect experience penalty.<P>By the way...  mod rods kinda suck...  I know they are useful if you make them before a battle but give me a break.  There is no reason for them to cost so much mana and health.  Enchanters, Necros, and Wizards all have mana regen abilities while we only have a costly mana storage ability.<P>Thanks for your time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yes you clearly have read the arguments in favour of pet upgrades and of the sort.. i generally agree with them.  i wld like to add the fact that the mage is pet centered.  and a petless mage is useless in the higher levels where their nukes are pathetic.  ( no lures, no damage to high resist ton of hp mobs)  im ok with that.. so what we sacrifice DD's sigh... but then our pets shd still be a viable solution to dmg.   We are our pets... let me repeat we ARE our pets... im fairly content with mages pre 50 no large problems.. im thankful for the petjboot upgrade if it goes live.  that something the younger mages will appreciate and deserve.  for us high level mages frustrated with high level play.... we need better pets !!  i like earth for example... ample hps  decent damage..  in groups... not too useful as its taunt doest do diddly.  same goes for all pets... no taunt... very little to no defensive abilities.  So ok, sigh we have no defense in group.  how about offense.  well earth does decent punching power, water is fine  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  ( if im ever lucky enough to get a drop ill be even happier)  fire, well um.. casts spells that um do a bit less than expected... and well its melee is er  kinda weak... look into that pls  +)   air is nice, no complaints there.   i wld like to upgrade their abilites to haveing an *UBERTAUNT* ability for pet... hmm relate this to a warrior dicipline if  u can... some sort of time delayed special ability saved for those urgent situations when the warrior must stay alive and no heals can be given.   ubertaunt on !! and the mob jumps to the pet as long as no one else is taunting.  for 20 seconds if u will.  just give us some sort of dmg absorption in groups.    decoy pet u say?   uh if we have an enchanter among us we wld hang.  dispelling mezzes is baaad.   decoy for non chanter crowd control u say?... um no  they die fast... earth is better for that   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  ive saved quite a few peeps by DS ing my earthie and sending him into the train .  then wait as long as i can before zoneing.   pet CH is an awesome idea.... situational of course....  my vote goes YES for personal pet names too  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">))<P>the best thing i cld say to "whom this may concern" is to think like a mage.....  we want to be able to walk into a high level zone,  /ooc mage lfg.  and have somebody actually want us for something other than "well we need one more and its been hours since an  XXXX hasnt shown up..."<BR>i like mages... i only play my main mage.   i like grouping too.  ive never really been a soloing mage before.. this is something ive had to learn in my 48 + levels because of general disintrest in mages.   i wld like to get back to grouping and chatting while we slaughter those nasties !!  pls give us hope.  thank u for ur time and attention.<P>    -Yahve, Tarrew Marr Elementalist</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am a level 53 mage, here are some problems I have with my mage when comparing my power to other classes power, which is class balance.<P>As mentioned before, from other posts, mages are great pre-50; we can solo most blue stuff till around level 39+, when things get a little to hard for it to be worthwhile because of 5-10min downtime meding. Absor you seem to think that mages can solo really well, but we can't, and it only gets worse as we get higher in level. I'll explain a little... <P>I wanted to try soloing in Burningwood so I got my earth pet out(lvl 51 pet spell), got full mana, and then pulled a blue skeleton(forget which kind)... I sent my pet in, malosied, then chain nuked with CHAR (lvl 52 nuke, fire based, 670dmg, 260mana at lvl 53) and at the end of the battle I had half a bub left of mana, and my pet at 10% hp! Now just think if my one or two of my nukes had been resisted... my pet would have died, then I would have died unless I gated because mages have NO escape except for gate.  I dont care so much that I could not solo this mob easily, but the fact that I would have been dead if I had not killed it with the pet alive.<P>This is another problem mages have, we have no escape spells (besides gate) like other caster classes. Here are a few escape spells I can think of from the other classes:<P>Necromance: Fear, Root, Snare(darken), mez, FD, Shadowstep type spells, gate. (7)<BR>Enchanter: Root, Mez, Fear, Gate. (4)<BR>Wizard: Shadowstep type spells, gate, snare, root. (3)<BR>Shaman: Root, Gate. (2)<BR>Druid: Root, Snare, Gate. (3)<BR>Paladin: Root, Lay on Hands. (2)<BR>Ranger: Root, Snare (2)<BR>Shadow Knight: Snare, FD. (2) <BR>Mage: Gate, I do not consider any of our pets escape spells because they have 10sec cast time and require reagents. (1)<P>Now how on gods earth is this considered balance? The HYBRIDS have more escape spells than the mage, a pure caster! The jboot speed spell you added to the test server is a start... I mean, if we can keep our pets to stay up with us, then we can actually use them as an escape, but.. only in OUTDOOR zones.. /sigh. I really see nothing wrong with giving mages the root series. <P>I would just like to compare mages solo power to necros solo power for a second:<BR>I was grouping with my 53 necro friend in BW. He would pull a mob, send pet in, snare, fear, then cast his life tap spell that gives him 700hp over time. He would remain skelly form the whole time, even when pulling. I would send my pet in, malosi, nuke w/ char twice. After the mob died he would go pull another blue, and by the time he got back with another mob I was NOT even full mana! Heres my point - A necro can not only solo almost any blue mob with incredible ease but also do it without even having to med after battles. The only time my necro friend meds is between fear casts. Now come on verant! How can you be allowing this? <P>Ok now that I told you our ability to solo post-50 is almost impossible your probably thinking.. just go group level 50-60. This is a great idea, I love grouping.. only one problem, mages are one of the least picked classes to join a group in ANY indoor place(pre-55 w/ coh); outdoor is a different story.  The main reason I can think of why this is true is the PETS.. sometimes they are more of a hastle than they are worth. A mage pet is almost not even part of the group, which it should be. It should have its own health bar, be effected by group spells, and have commands to make it not 'attack back' when attacked so the enchanter can mez, etc, etc. If you promote grouping VI, then why do you make pets so non-group friendly, which directly effects the mage and other pet classes.<P>Let me tell you my experiances in finding groups so far post-50. So far I have been looking for groups in karnors (why? only place I could get a group within 30min of /ooc 53 mage lfg - Im serious). While in karnors I noticed im almost always the last person to join a group, which to me, means that I am NOT needed and im only joining for 'extra damage'. So basicly after all the neccesary classes (enchanter, cleric, warrior) have joined, I have a chance of getting into the group. I also NEVER see a group shouting for a mage. The truth is, mages are NOT needed for ANY group in karnors or other dungeons for that matter untill we get CoH, at level 55. I really wish VI would move CoH to a lower level because it is very hard for me to get exp because of the time I have to play and my lack of soloing ability. If I had CoH I would be able to get into dungeon groups alot easier, making me much happier.<P>I really think mages need major balance fixes. I have not even mentioned all the things that other players have mentioned on these boards which also need to be addressed. These are just a few of the serious problems I have, and I would really like for them to be looked at.<P><BR>Talidar<BR>-53 Gnome Mage.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

This holds true for melee classes and clerics, but is NOT the case for mage pets!  In fact, as the numbers show, Mage's power grows less between 50 and 60 than it does between 40 and 50!<P>40-50, mage pets increase over 100% in Hitpoints, and 40% in damage potential.  50-60 the increase is 20% in hitpoints, and a paltry 7% in damage potential!<P>The post-50 pets are pathetic.  All of them, not just fire.  The only one that is reasonably in line with the pre-50 pets is the Level 51 Earth pet.  The rest need to be looked at.<P>Not to mention our post-50 nukes are barely upgrades from those we used before Kunark, if at all.<P>A level 60 mage should be every bit as powerful in relation to a level 50 mage as a level 50 mage is in relation to a level 40 mage.  This is nowhere close to being true.

</FONT><HR>Well, in an effort to make sure the horse is completely dead and no longer suffering I would like to chime in with the following.<P>Quote<BR>"It's very hard to find anything wrong with the overall balance of this class. They can solo for their entire career fairly well."<P>This is true only in so much as Everquest has pushed mages into retirement a little after level 50. <P>Quote<BR>"Because of their pets, they are welcome enough in any group, and at higher levels they get the Malo spell line that makes them even more welcome."<P>Not true at higher levels.<BR>A pet is so dangerous to a group on a raid that only the Village Idiot would cast one and risking destroying the raid party. While I hear rumors of a spell on the Test server that will summon a pet back to you, that will only help the situation slightly. What we need is a way to call the pet back and clear the agro list instantaneously, make it Dungeon only if you are worried about exploitation. The reasons are much more than Area Effect spells such as Fear and bad pathing, the most dangerous thing that I have found with a pet getting loose is the lag that accompanies most multi group raids. If you have lag + runner or gater, it = death to the group. There will be no way to cast a spell in time to save the raid unless it is very fast casting and clears the agrro list. Malo is a great line of spells, it is a shame the resist is so great in Velious and on other high level mobs. <P>All the Mag are become relatively weak as you  progress thru you fifties. Both the mobs and the melee classes are considerable more powerful as you move thru the fifities. ( Okay well I don’t know about Water because I have only seen the Water pet drop once in at least 90 hours played in Sebilis and Skyfire and lost the random.)  Don’t get me wrong, I think that the Melee Classes should see significant improvement, To understand how much better the pets should be, take a level 49 Warrior and  a 49 Summoned  Pet, The pets ability to deliver and take damage should change the same percentages as the Warrior changes as his levels increases. This lack of a pets relative increase and the associated disappointment that I have felt is compounded by the fact that the whole post 50 game is basically a Warrior, Cleric, Enchanter type of game. To replace any of them with any other class will reduce the effectiveness of the group.    <P>While on the topic of Pets, I claim post 50 fire pets are totally useless. If you can show me one legitimate instance where a post 50 fire pet provides more advantages than a level 34 Fire pet, I will publicly eat the fire pet along with this post. Just one, and I will lend you my Mag because I feel certain that Verant does not have post 50 mag's.<P>Spell drops, lord do they stink after the 54th level. I have seen it argued that this was fair to do because other Classes have to get there armor via drops.  I say to that these are not comparable and that to do a fair comparison, you would have to ask the question “ What if  all post 50 melee classes had to have a scroll drop and learned before the could improve any of their disciplines.”<P>I spent a lot of time and money to become good at research, what a waste, then you  go and put so many core spells out of reach or make them so rare is unbelievable (yes pets are core spells) . ( This was the preverbal straw that caused me to retire my  nearly level 56 Mag.). You have to make the spells for all Classes much more common.<P>Although I no longer play my Mag, the most unconscionable acts that I have seen you guys do was to give so many other classes a Improved Invisibility spell and not give one to the Mag’s.  Of all the classes that are totally helpless when they are invisible the Mag without a pet, a root, a snare, a mezz….. is by far the most vulnerable. Shame on you guys, no wonder Mags feel persecuted.<P>Last of all I would like to take a second to discuss No Rent items.  We should get rid of them completely. There is nothing that this game should do to keep people from logging out to take care RL obligations and commitments. This includes not only Mag summoned items but also other items that are dropped in the game. This is a no brainer. If you feel that some Mag item is overpowering if it is no rent then get rid of the damn thing. I can’t even begin to guess how much people have lost due to LD using the Summoned Fool’s bag. ( Including this fool.) Certainly those items that are consumable should last until you use them.  <P>Your opening comments leading into this discussion may be valid for Mages up to about the 50ish level but they are totally off base for higher levels. I really think that it demonstrates Verant’s lack of understanding the class. <P>Thanks for taking the time to read this.<BR>55 Magician ( retired )<BR>46 Enchanter<BR>40 Cleric<BR>5 Warrior<BR>  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>(The bugged version of Part Two has disappeared, along with my post within it.  I'm not sure just what happened, so here it is again, just incase the first one was well and truely lost. )<P>I'm trying to keep it brief, so I'm going right to my topics.<P>-Elemental Illusions: first, a couple of quotes from the Enchanter thread:<BR>"Undead Illusions: I, frankly, feel that enchanters shouldn’t have these spells. I will ask that we look at them, and consider that they are the territory of the necromancer." <BR>"Illusion, Wolf: There has been a call to have this spell grant Spirit of Wolf. If it gets no Spirit of Wolf component, then perhaps it could work indoors. I’ll have it on the list. I am very much against such homogenization of the classes. In fact, so much so that I don’t really think that enchanters should even be allowed to transform into wolves at all." <P>I can't help but feel that such logic would lead to a problem with the fact that enchanters get to become Elementals, but Mages can't, despite the fact that Elementals are the territory of the Mage.  My suggestion would be to give Elemental form spells to Mages, and to add class faction to the Enchanter illusions (ie. Undead illusions make them regester as Necromancers instead of Enchanters).  I doubt that we will get these spells, but I feel that I have to at least ask.<P>-The Power of Summoned Items: It may be best to address the power of summoned items be comparing them to the buffs that other spell casting classes can give.  While more powerful summons will allow the twinking of lower level characters with summoned weapons and items, this is really no worse than what a high level shaman or cleric can do.  The only real differences are in stacking effects (summoned weapons don't stack with non-summoned ones and 2 summoned items can't stack if they both go in the Ammo slot), and "buff" duration.  So please, don't be afraid to give us some real power in this area.  I have faith that the  Live Team can reach a good balance in this area.  <P>-Summoned Weapon Effects: Is it possable to give summoned weapons non-standard procs?  A sword that procs only against Gnolls, or a spear that only procs agains giants would be a change from the normal weapon procs.  If not that, is it possable to have weapons that proc only in certan zones?  A "Maul of the Mountains" (procs only in mountain type zones) or "Trident of the Waves" (procs only in ocean/lake zones) create situational variety with the summoned weapons.<P>-The Flare Spell: Make this into three different spells: Red Flare, Blue Flare, and Yellow Flare.  Have a text message for when you are hit (ie. You shine with a blue light.) or when someone near you is hit (ie. Furball Miller glows with a yellow light).  This would give mages a chance to find new uses for this spell, including using it for "fun factor".  If nothing else, this could improve its usability as a visual signal.<P>-The Fun of Summoned Items: To improve the player appeal of the class without making another change in its power, Mages need more "fun" summons.  Items that carry charges of the three different bolt spells I mentioned above, summoned champagne, summoned pastries, ect.  Everything that's needed for a fun party, or minor guild event, let them summon it.  You can even include the fun factor into some of the "utility" summons (ie. putting the charges of Flare into 1hb staves).<P>Just remember to make them LOW LEVEL!  People playing at the lower end of the game are the ones most likely to have the time to enjoy the "just for fun" spells.  You should not have to get all the way to level 50+ to summon party supplies and toys.  <P>-Pet EXP: If having and using a pet is considered a class ability, then they should not, under ANY conditions, take EXP from the summoner.  If it does, then it becomes a conditional class EXP penalty, and the pet classes are suddenly on the short end of the "Experience stick".<P>-Petless Mages: Many are asking for some kind of defensive spell to help when the mage is attacked while petless.  Root and snare have obvious problems in this area.  My suggestion would be to allow mages to summon an Expendable, Lore item that gives Spirit of Cheetah.  That would allow mages to make a quick escape and buy them time to try something else to survive, without giving them alot of extra power in combat.<P>-Eye of Zomm: The Eye of Zomm is a sadly underused spell. To use it, a mage can have no other pets out at that time. The eye can aggro a KOS MOB back onto the mage, and has little to no combat vaue. These problems make it a spell most mages use only as a fun way to pass time. However, it has a very short duration, making it fall somewhat short of its amusement potental. I suggest that the duration of this spell be increased. I would also suggest that the Zomm's Eye be removed from the global file, and replaced with a rat. The spell could be reset to use a small rat as the POV pet, adding to the fun factor. This change would also allow the "mouse form illusion" that some enchanters have asked for. (I have no idea how this would affect the Rage of Zomm spell or the ideas for that spell.  Sorry.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> )<P>-Research: Chain research is evil.  There needs to be a way to bypass this problem, without simply putting the spells on a vendor (unfair to the other Int casters).  My suggestion would be to place four books on some vendors, and allow the books to be used in place of the spell scrolls.  Make one book for each element (Tome of Earth, Tome of Air, ect), and feel free to not have any one vendor sell all four books.<P>I also feel that the Practice Runes quests are (when not bugged) simply not worth the cost.  The practice runes carry a high price in time and/or plat for many Mages, making guild practice points the only real way to improve this skill.  Is there any chance that this could be looked into soon, to see if it might need rebalancing?<P>-The Mage Epic Quest: To the list of complaints about the quest I have another to add.  The cloak from Quillmane is highly sought after by many mid level characters.  Now, Mages seeking their Epic Weapon are directly competing for a spawn with an entire zone full of lower level characters.  The chances of a nasty conflict over this No Drop item are too great to be ignored.<P>While I have more to say on several other issues, I feel that others have allready said it well enough.  I won't bore you with it yet again.<P>Thank you,<BR>ChibiDragon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I tend to think they were, but the balance has shifted WAY too far in the opposite direction.  <P>The only casters that scaled properly post-50 were the Cleric (CHeal) and the Enchanter (Who uses spells to mitigate damage through crowd control, and does his damage by buffing the tanks with haste).  <P>Pre-50, your ability to succeed in a group scenario was determined by the entire group's collective mana pool.  Post-50, it's determined on your tank's equipment and your cleric/chanter's mana pools.<P>Is this balanced?  One can make an argument that it is.

Then create the line of spells back along the mage's spell line. This gives both a purpose, and a use to our dots. This also makes more sense for the mage's point of view, that of being 'elemental masters.'<P>Example Spell:<P>Level 12 Spell<P>Creeping Ice<BR>Mana: 50<BR>Casting Time: 3.5 sec<BR>Recast: Instant<BR>Effect: A 25 pt initial damage hit, and 30pts over 30 seconds. Ice based Damage<P>Conclusion Spell.<P>Flash Freeze<BR>(exact copy of the level 55 dot, but ice in nature)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well most of my concerns have been addressed in the previous posts. I have read a good 80% to 90% of them so forgive me if this one issue has been brought up.<P>Right before the sword of runes fix/nerf our pets were procing far less than they used to. I think that I read a post saying that their dex was lowered far below than what they were at. If you intend to fix our summoned weapons and give us some that are actualy usefull then please address this dex issue with pets. What good will it be if you put time and effort into making weapons with nice procs if our pets are only able to make them proc once every 2 or 3 battles. Our pets are our life and they should have the dex of a tank class that is around the same level as the pet spell. Also pets do not wear armor and have equipment like tanks do so please give them the base dex of a moderatly equiped tank.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'll voice the same opinion several other posters did so far. <P>post 50 pets: Pre kunark they used to be better than melees both in tanking and damage dealing. The difference was probably too wide, but keep in mind that pets cause problems. A group lose flexibility when a pet class join because the pet aggro more, break mezz sometimes, can cause trains (a very rare event though), so they have to provide something to make up for all of this, and post 50 mage pets don't outdamage melees anymore, and this is why mages are having a hard time finding groups - because their advantages (damage) no longer offset their disadvantages (pets cause problems).<P>Mages are mostly pets. The rest of their spells pale in comparison with all other casters. It's harder to decide my spell line up with my level 29 CLERIC than it is with my level 53 magician. My level 55 enchanter has 19 pages of useful spells, my mage has 8... <P>Now about mages being balanced... they are defintely not!!! I retired my mage at level 53 after many weeks of frustration - I felt I wasn't holding my weight anymore. I switched to an enchanter, and since he reached level 48, guess how many times my mage has been preferred over my enchanter for raids and xp groups when I gave people a choice? 3 times... twice for rakashiir raids because of the fire pet immunity to the fire AOE and ONCE for an xp group. And my enchanter is level 55 now. That's months of playing. Now my enchanter is my primary and will stay my primary, but I'd like to play my mage from time to time, and right now there's no compelling reasons for me to do so, or for people to ask me to do so.<P>There's not many solutions to fix mages, in fact they are pretty obvious.<BR>1) Give them more utility, but if you do that, you blur the distinction between classes, and I don't think it's a good idea<BR>2) Upgrade pet damage to make magicians the #1 damage dealing class again.<BR>3) Merge the magician and wizard classes together (basically give wizard mage pets...) - that would fix both classes problems in one shot (won't happen).<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am not going to repeat what all the other mages have explained as to the major problems with mages post-50.  I agree wholeheartedly.<P>Just a quick comment as to specialization. I have specialized in evoker (and have maxed it) but would like to see our DD line changed to conjurors since that is what we are.  I would only ask that the quest to reset the specialization set the current specialization back to 50 instead of setting all back to 0.  This would mean that I would only have to re-work my new  main specialization.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Too be honest I don't have many issues with the Class, but I would rather see us in the role you painted long ago, Master of Summoning.<P>I look at Mages as Elementalists.. well we summon them.<P>First off we should have spells that deal with the elements.<P>Endure fire / cold lines<P>Our damage spells should reflect this as well.. as well as our summoned items. For every Fire DD or Bolt spell we should have an equal in Cold. Give Wizards the Magic based spells like the shocks. The spells on our items should also deal with the elements.<P>Lastly for Mages, Master of Pets.. I want Buffs for pets only.<P>Pet Regen<BR>More pet heals<BR>Pet stat increases (Str, Sta, Dex, Agi)<BR>Pet haste spells<BR>Pet AC and HP increases<BR>Get rid of the burnout line and break it up<P>This won't mix with other classes.. because it for pets only and our pets only. I would rather be actively suporting my pet in battle then casting DD spells like a weak wizard. I also think this will add to the grouping of Mages.. by reducing their solo ability. But in the same light we have to be able to be valuable in a group. With the reduce DD output give our Pets the increase. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Greetings, Absor.<P>This is my first post ever on this board, since I hate whinethreads.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I have only a couple of comments about Magicians - my primary is a Mage (only 35), and I enjoy the class more than any other.<P>Things I would very much like to see:<P>1. Bind Wounds boosted somewhat. Whether it's increasing the upper limit or allowing us to practise it way up high, this is pretty much the only way of getting health back for us and other non-healing classes (I mean, without relying on others). I don't really understand why I'm *still* rubbish at it at level 35.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>2. Can we have a *decent* firework effect?! I've had fireworks once, handed to me by another Mage, and I thought they were rubbish. You're better off casting Sentinel or Flare. How about a flare-style firework, with a little 'boom' at the end of its flight? Or a 'Column of fire' style effect (smaller, though)? THEN they'd be great!!<P>3. Summonings: Food and water - a stack is great, thank you. Coldstones are cool. Waterstones are vunderbar. But the weapons really are awful. I mean, I don't want to summon a Wyrmslayer (well, if you *really* want to add it...), but something *useful* would be good.<P>4. Trade skills. I raised this yonks ago - I still feel we're pretty much the only class without a tradable trade skill. Warriors are smiths, Enchanters are jewellers, Druids and Shamans cast SoW, Necros and Bards can corpse hunt, etc. etc. We have no real way of making money. (And before you say 'sell your summoned stuff', don't be silly. No one wants to pay for them, except for things like 200 bandages. The *only* time these can be sold is waaaaaaay out in the wilderness, and even then for rubbish money.) It would be nice to have something to sell, maybe a long-lasting damage shield (the one I'm currently using lasts an astounding, incredibly useful 2 minutes. Gosh.).<P>Other than that, I like my Mage.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Freem Sancesse<BR>The Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First thing I would like to say is our new DOT's ROCK and are far from useless! My fellow Mags that don't get this need to reaserch a bit more how our DoT's work. Each wave of our DoT that hits will interupt any mobs casting and it helps to keep a mob from argoing on to us. These are very usefull spells and I for one feel it is about time we have them.<P>I don't really agree with the idea that we Mag's are a very balanced class but I will say we are not on the bottom of the food chain either. Some of the changes mentioned will help in bringing Mags to becomming more balanced but I feel there a couple things that have been missed and are not huge but would go a long way to helping balance out our class.<P>Root is a spell that all pure casters get except for we Mags. I can already here the response comming that,"your pet roots so you do have that spell". Our earth pet being able to root does not give us Mags the ability to park a mob which in the higher lvls is what the spell is really used for. And we can only hope to root a mob that our earth pet is fighting, cant have our pet turn to an add on mob in the middle of a fight and have him root it, just doesnt work that way. Also what happens when we want to use another pet besides Earth? I dont see any reason at all why we Mag's should not get this spell as it has been give to just about ever other casting class out there.<P>When I am apart of a group why cant my pet be apart of the group too, after all the damage he puts out is counted towrds the group? He doesnt have to count as a group member as far as taking up one of the PC spots but why cant he count as a member when Group only buff spells are cast? Or hey even just for when I cast my group DS spell? This just doesn't make much sense to me and I think many Mag's if not all would agree! <P>We are the Masters of the Elements that can never cast cold or air spells? Does anyone else just find this really odd or is just me? We dont have to have better Air and Cold spells than the other classes but come on we should have some.<P>How about being able to tell my pet not to cast? In groups I get asked all the time not to make my Earth pet cause of his random root spell that he casts all the time. He is my strongest pet and the best tank and I cant use him many times in group cause I can't command him to stop casting. This would be an awesome change and one that would benifit Necros as well.<P>Ok now with that out of the way I wanted to comment on the changes real fast that have been brought up by Absor. Think they are all pretty good except I can give a rats...., well I wont use that word, about pet names, but other than that I would agree with all the changes mentioned. I was very glad to see the Robe of Conjuration brought up. Necros have their very powerfull summon corpse up grade attached to their robe, a lvl 59 spell and very sought after, and we Mags get our lvl 49 Lava Shield spell as our effect? LOL this really does need to be changed. The lvl 56 DS is a good idea for the effect but I think a better one would be to have the robe cast COTH, after all it would fall right in line with the Necro Robe effect.<P>Talic Mightyheart <BR>LVL 55 Conjurer<BR>Sol Ro Server<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have been playing Everquest since a couple weeks after release and always as a magician. The following is centered around the high level magician.<P><BR>Epic encounters and the pets.<P>Making the pets immune to fear is great and will make the magician useful for the epic encounters in RoK. However I would also like to see an additional spell or spells that will improve situationally the pets power versus the epic SoV encounters. Even the epic quest pet do miss a LOT versus red to a level 60 mobs and subsequently the magician has a very low damage output in these long fights since the DD’s we get are useless in these encounters. Solution would be a very costly and time limited pet buff making it increase its damage output versus mobs way over its level. It would need to be high cost in terms of mana, and have a long recast time so that it basically would be very inefficient in solo fights versus other mobs, where the pet does good damage anyway. <P><BR>The rains<P>When using a pet you will almost never see a magician use his rain spell AND it blocks the other classes with rains from using them too, which means it hurts the casters in general and not only the magician. Making the rain ignore the pet(s) will be a good thing and with its current resist rates will in no way overpower the class. Our spells damage output takes a nosedive post 50, make rains viable and it will help that situation.<P><BR>The solo magician<P>The magician can solo, no doubt, but he cannot solo well when compared to other classes. The main reason for this is that the pet hug 50% of the experience if it does more than half the damage. Recently you basically took away the hybrid exp penalty because as you said, the game was not balanced with that exp penalty in mind. I doubt the magician is balanced so that you expect him to kill twice as many mobs as other classes to get the same experience gain.<P>Why not improve on the pet healing capabilities of the magician, make it a viable alternative to chaincasting pets. This is something I would love to see, and it would make soloing post 50 a tiny bit better.<P><BR>Spells:<P>SoV spells comments: Why don’t magicians get improved invisibility? Apart from the Burnout IV, our SoV spells are virtually useless. Monster summoning line is cool, but not really useful. Shard of the core: Make this tradeable please, why is it no drop anyway? DoT’s: Never use them, never will. If you want us to use them, they would have to be improved significantly, which I doubt will happen.<P>I think the Shard of the Core type spell can be expanded and be made a really useful, group friendly and raid friendly but not overpowering line of summons. The current version has 2 resists, make similar versions covering double resists of all types and a special HP+AC summon, or sta+ac, all for the range slot.<P>Magicians never have great versatility in DD’s, which is perhaps why we see the level 52 Char spell quite often being the best spells versus a high level mob.  Maybe this can be improved, I don’t know, and really think improvements to the class should be centered around the pet and our summons. The summons in general are too weak, and about the only one I get requests for are food and water, and a +poison dagger for Trak kills.

</FONT><HR>is there a way the summon monster spell could be "adjusted" to act more like a single target dot than a pet. its a non persistant summoned critter that poofs when it's target dies (or it dies) that we can call up in conjunction with a pet if need beI understand that this could be really unbalancing, so I would suggest multiplying the mana cost by 1.5 (or double) and upping  the spell component to a more expensive gemstone and reduce the casting down so it "can" be an escape spell for mages.  upping the cost of the spell so its NOT usable for general play could help in preventing abuse, having it for emergencies would be helpful.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have been playing this game for way over a year now, and through out the whole time being a Magician is what I focused on.  Throughout months and going from one spell ring to the next (1 to 49lvl) I saw my pets become stronger.  My burnout line got better (and a regen effect was later put on).  The Magician class was fun, since I've always like the fact of having something else do the fighting.<P>Now that I am 54 I haven't seen that much of an improvement from 49 pets.  I know VI doesn't want to give our pets more HP's, but what about more offense skills for them.  The whole thing about being a Magician is being able to solo, this is a fact just be the way we have been designed.  We have 1 group spell, and our Malise lines, this right here I believe proves we were never really meant to be grouped 100% of the time.  On this notion I really believe our pets should be looked at (50 to 60).<P>My focus has changed a lot since I started to play.  I was all about soloing, but since the release of Kunark/Velious I am more compelled to group just for the simple fact I can't go toe to toe with a lot of the mobs, unless they are lower con blues.  Now I really like grouping, it helps to cut down times and it allows me to meet a few new people.  But when it comes down to who gets into a sebilis group or any other group it boils down to a few things; Damage Output, Healing, Hit points, Taunting.  Yes we have all of these within our pets, but when pathing and being able to control our pets come into play, we loose all of them within a matter of seconds.<P>So to kind of finalize my thoughts VI should ask a question.  What is the magi class?  Is it a solo class or is it a group class, perhaps both.<P>If a solo class I think these things should be looked at.<P>1. Our pets power either in the way of defense, hit points or damage output.  One thing that I know is a counter to this is if more Hit points are given or damage output is increased then the high level encounters will be done in far less time, or made to easy.  Now with defense (talking about pet) in the group setting, I know for a fact it won't mean a thing; since just about all magi's turn off taunts to allow the damage to be done on one target and allow the cleric to concentrate on one or two PC’s instead of a bunch.<P>2. Some type of fail safe to allow us to better escape the grasps of death when our pet dies.  Comparing to a Necro they have 4 things.  Roots, Snares, Fear, Feign Death.  Just one of these things would be indeed a good bonus to us.  Root probably being the better pick, since our earth can root already.  Or a quicker gate (I would be happy with that)<P>If you are to say as a grouper then take a look at these things<P>1. More group shared spells.  Maybe the shield of the magi, or phantom armor, or even elemental armor. All of these spells could be shared.  I know for a fact the shield of spells can be shared since there is a staff that procs this.<P>2. A more wanted damage shield. I know 33 points is a lot, even 25 points.  But what about a single target high-level damage shield that is something along the lines of 1 point per level. Only castable on 44 plus players.  Since our fire pet damage shield was taken away (kind of) then why not return the spell back to the mage to allow them to give to a player?<P>3. More control over pets.  High-level raids often involve multiple encounters.  I would think once a mage got to a certain level they would be masters of there pets.  I often see when doing raids in shouts "kill your pets" this is because our pets will switch targets on a whim (since they got hit by something else) This then makes them break mezzes and get the chanters killed, which then gets the clerics killed because they are healing the chanter, and so on.  After that we look like we can't control our pets.  The only thing I ask for is a simple command or a upgrade to a existing command.<P>/pet single attack - tells the pet to only attack 1 target and then come back to you after the target is dead.<P>/pet taunt - the same thing as above, but would probably give other pet controlled classes the option to use this command as well.<P>Either way will work, but we now make the pet better in groups because it will no longer break mezzes.  The question is should other pet classes get this command.  I would have to say no, since other classes have more viable options than pets.  This type of command should only be after level 50.<P>The call of pet spell is a nice idea, but not really good enough, except when you pet decides to roam off.  This spell is useless for the most part when the magi learns that they can use /pet guard here or /pet sit down.. 9 times out of 10 this keeps the pet from roaming.  Also if the call of pet spell doesn't clear agro's then what really does this spell achieve?  Truly a good idea to combat pathing, but I would rather have more control over the pet, then being able to call it back... and here is how this spell will be used..<P>We get immunity to fear spell.. we get call of the pet spell. The immune to fear spell wares off we call pet.. reapply immune to fear spell, and send pet back in.  Do you want this? If so that is fine by me.  But I would almost be willing to trade in both spells just to have more control over pet.<P>Well I know I am long winded, but I hope you read my posts with a open mind and see that I have tried my best to address what I believe is more important aspects of being a mage.  All of these ideas are for the most part centered around being in a group setting, I know you want people to group, which only explains why things have gotten so hard.  I only ask that the tools for us to be more group friendly be added to the magi class.<P>Thank you for the time.<P>Skyspark Evermen<BR>54th Magi of Prexus<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>all of these idea's or most of them are good one's.  But the part he posted about, blah blah mages are balanced blah blah can Solo.<P>I'm sorry but 50+ we cannot solo. Necromancers, druids THEY can solo.  Kunark creatures hit Far to hard and are pets simply do not do enough damage or do not have enough hp's or ac, or a bit of all of the above. And Since we are not necro's we dont have darkness/fear, we dont have a big enough heal spell to even bother healing the pet, Burnout 4 no one can find heck most of are 55+ spells no one has.  <P>DOT spells for magicians LOLROF its obvious no one at EQ plays a magician. Take away are dots and give us better nukes, prefurably one's with a low cast time since we have to pause to remake pets when we try to solo b/c they are dead. Oh and are 57 dd add a 2 second stun effect on this spell. Why? b/c most other class's have a spell with a stun, it takes forever to cast it and when it finally goes off for a whopping 50? more damage then are 51dd char, it seams to really make the creatures mad. <P>Why cast phantom armor? almost every other class buff in the game removes it and wont stack with it. including a necromancers Death pact (there heal)<P>elemental armor... an upgrade would be nice. why? Well are AC in crap are health is weak, we cant take a hit worth anything, if we are going to be good at anything getting hit with ice/fire spells and resisting them or they not doing full damage would be nice. Also when you cast it, if it would actually stay on you for a longer time period that would be nice. <P>Group call of the hero, or a call of the hero that would work regardless of zone barriers would be VERY nice. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056270-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056270.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056270-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056270-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056270-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056270-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056270&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056270&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
