</FONT><HR>Ok I play a level 54 bard and have posted this about 2 other times but havent really gotten any reasponse, so here we go again.<P>Bards are given rogue skills, yet some are compleatly useless and all have such extremley low caps that they are more and more useless.  My main complaint is that when Rogues were remebersed for verant deciding not to implement traps, bards were some how forgotten.<P>Bards have disarm trap and such which were made useless skills so long ago.<P>Solution:  Since one of our skills was made useless make one of our skills more useful.  How about lock picking?  As it is right now their is not a single lock in all of kunark that we can pick.  I have capped my lockpicking(100) and the only locks that i can pick are beffallen and najena and the entrence to the hole.  The only usefullness to the skill at all for us is opening that entrence to the hole.  Why dont you (verant) lower maybe a third to a half of the locks in kunark to where they can be picked at 100?  This would still make it so rogues have a large advantage to groups but would also make this skill slightly useful to bards<P>-Arieck Kethyl'ir<BR>- 54 bard Cazic-Thule<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

We just want the songs to freakin' work like we were told.<P>If you were high enough level you would understand why Bard's need some kind of crowd control capability.

</FONT><HR>I had to stop reading partway through the thread, I do have real work to do today...<P>But here's the problem as I see it.<P>The song works with the percentage effectiveness that Verant wants it to.  And I think I understand why.  You just can't have a no mana, continuous mez with a good chance of success.  It's too powerful.<P>On the other hand, players are saying that even as is, one break of the spell leads to a bard beating, which in turn causes the song to drop and an even bigger beating to occur.  This makes singing this song a surefire taunt, and a certain death sentence to the bard.<P>Howsabout this as a solution.<P>Add a component to the song that will clear the bard from the hate list (or clear the whole hate list, if that's how those things work).  So, yes, if the song fails the bard will get beat.  But the ones that he successfully mezzed will not necessarily join the beating.  This might fix the problem all around.  It won't make the bard too powerful by being able to free mez the world, and it might keep the bard from getting beat to death every time.  It's also fairly consistant with the song effect.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Verant says, "Song is too powerful since it requires no mana"<P>Bards say, "Secondary resists make songs not work for all mez songs."<P>Solution:  Get rid of the secondary resist.  Make the song require mana.<P>You now have a functioning song at any level that can't be used indefinitely.  Only person this hurts is the programmer who gets stuck doing the code.  <P>Also, I'm a lvl 16 bard.  Lullaby ends up with me running to the zone against any group of mobs larger than 2.  An AE mez that only works 50% of the time against whites and is checked every 5 seconds means 1 of them is beating on me continuously.  Without that second resist, this song can work.  <P>Can we fix this please?

</FONT><HR>How does this announcement make me feel? it makes me feel sad, and angry, and above anything else, tired. Tired that one class, my class (and I do feel it is my class...I chose to be a bard long before I ever played the game...it is the first and only class I *ever* levelled up past 5) has been so battered, abused, and broken to relegate it to 1, maybe 2 roles. We are supposed to swallow willingly our weak song effects and ridiculous resists because of two , much vaunted "positives"<BR>#1 "Bards can melee"<BR>Quite frankly bards melee like a shaman or a druid...and in the 35+ game, to suggest that we melee *at all* would be dangerous because we might get the mobs attention, and that equals death, and wasteful, because to get the best out if this class, I need to be using an instrument.<P>#2 "songs are mana-less so we must make the weaker"<BR>The fact of the matter is, most songs are so pathetically, laughably weak compared to other class equivalents, whether or not they require mana is a moot point. <BR>Direct damages are about 1/10th or 1/20th compared to others. <BR>DoT's are similarly weakened, never mind that once a DoT is cast, it stays there for a duration...not me I must continue singing. <BR>Buffs are something often shouted at us to be a "strong point"....our haste songs, which btw are very few and fare between, are only really worth using in a melee-orientated party, which in case you hadnt realised is incredibly unlikely and suicidal at higher levels. And the haste sucks beyond beleif anyway. The stat buffs are worthless too, not only because they raise them by a pitiful amount (even with instrument) , but also because stats have very little noticable effect. Apart from wis/int which has a *direct and immediately positive effect* on mana...yay for casters! boo for melee-ers. So when looked at closely..the only buffs we do well are the resistances. With a hard to get magic drum. At very high levels. yay?<BR>Debuffs are very hard to use too. Snare is broken, and I mean BROKEN because when you look at it in total, its effect is so much less than other snares, as to make it worthless. In fact seeing as snare is a big recent issue, lets do an in-depth analysis;<BR>Bard snare must be re-applied every 5sec or so, less even when it has a randomly short duration. The resists are higher than normal snare. The effect is now weaker. If a &lt;insert name of any snare-capable class&gt; casts a snare, it will be resisted less, last about 3 minutes or longer, and have a sronger effect. Once it is cast , the player can forget about it, go back to nuking, or buffing...the mana can be easily regained before the snare wears off...so how is our snare balanced?<BR>Other debuffs are similarly worthless, like largos. Should ac debuff and slow. High resists and the need to refresh makes this a total pain in the ass to use, ever. Any other class with a slow spell can cast it, have less resists, and never worry about it again, until it wears off in several minutes time. Is this balance? IS IT???<BR>Finally, utility songs. This is something we do quite well actually...never mind our invis needs an instrument at all times so is useless for CR.<BR>Never mind the range on the lev/water breathing songs is so short as to make them really really hard to use in most situations. Oh and we run fast. hoorah :/<BR>And finally lullaby...didnt know where to put this, so why not here. Even if we assume that the resist on pre-30 mobs is 20-40% (depending on Cha, mobs MR, etc...), which it isnt. And bearing in mind that it doesnt work on 30+ mobs by verants own admission, and neither do the other mezz songs. The minimum duration a bard can keep any number of mobs mezzed is the time it takes for 1 to resist. 1 resist will usually meane the mob wakes up and bashes the bard, stopping his song, causing the others to wake up. so if resists are 30%, and using it against , say, 3 mobs (not a large number really), the chance the bard can keep those 3 mezzed for any amount of time is rather slim. 6sec between every resist check, every 6 seconds every mob will have another chance to resist. This means this song will never be of any use, even pre 30!!<BR>So there you have it. If you wrote down every ability the bard has , they would seem overpowered. Especially when you sau "no mana" and "cast while moving". Well most of our songs are so weak as to be useless. Taking no mana to do something useless doesnt make it worthwhile. To be honest, im seriously considering selling it all up and playing a druid. Becuase they have all our abilities, but hey! They work, and they do something. Right now the only thing stopping me is my pride, and the fact my server needs another druid like bards need another area effect damage song.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Two things- I'll attempt to be brief- I play a wizard as my primary so I do understand having class limitations (in my opinion, my class is very limited) but I play an alt bard but havent picked him up in quite a while due to the inherent problems related to the class as a whole, which from reading this post, appears to get even worse at higher levels.  My questions are thus":<P>1.  If the class was unbalanced , why don't I see other classes complaining about bards?  I have yet to see an enchanter on this thread or any other complaint that the bard mez would take their job away.  Why? Because bards cant be primary enchanters anyway- songs aren't strong enough to do so and bards wont want to twist anyway if there is an enchanter in the group.  As most people know, if there is a disparity amongst the classes in the minds of the player, this board will let Verant know (see the current complaints about druids and wizards quad kiting).   So my main question is this- Is Verant the ONLY entity who wishes the bard class nerfed.  I have a feeling that is the case, as reading back over this threat, I see a large amount of support from non-bard classes and players that dont play bards.  Why nerf something if its not broken.  Why take something away from players when no one asked you to. Enchanters do you folks really care if you are not the only party member in the group with an effective mez?  Do you folks think you cant get into a group if there is a bard already in said group? (I use enchanters as an example b/c the bard class clearly is inferior to warriors, druids and rogues, its "parent" class and and I think bard players have come to accept that).<P>2. <P>&lt;&lt;Most spells work as intended until someone finds a way to make it work in a way that wasn't intended. People think that new way they've discovered is the way it is supposed to work, so when we make changes so that it only works as intended, it's perceived as a nerf.&gt;&gt;<P>That is an interesting statement made by here by Gordon- why does Verant dictate what is intended versus the circumstances?  I saw someone say it was "verant's game" - well, it is only to the point where they keep it up and running- I plunk down 10 bucks a month so my opinion is worth as much as any other player OR verant employee.    Why penalize a player for taking what limited resources given to them and make them work for the class.  Its unbelievable that when an "unintended effect" is discovered ("unintended" basically means that a really good player found a way to do something new and diffent through lots of practice and intiative) that discovery is nerfed.  WHY? Who complains?  The Vision? I doubt it.  Dont penalize players who are already playing what I considered a gimped class (though bards, please dont take offense- I think the theory behhind the bard class is extremely appealing but many times you are regulated to mana battery)by nerfing ways they have found to increase their power and abilities.<P>Folks at Verant- I've seen almost no complaints prior to these threads and the offical announcment that a bard is in any way overpowered-thusly, why depower bards?  I worry that Verant's solutions to classing problems usually ends with a nerf and nothing i nreturn.  I see gameplay as a losely based contract- if something is to occur, there needs to be consideration to the other party.  Instead of just insisting on nerfing bards, why dont you compensate them in some other way for the nerf.<P>Verant please dont take away something without giving something back- in balancing the classes, if you take something from one end of the scale, the only way to actually have balance is to remove something from the other end of the scale, so remove a limitation on another song to make bards more effective.<P>For my two coppers, I will always invite a bard into my group.  The truly skilled are an asset, even nerfed buts it seems unfair to frustrate such a wide variety of people without a real explanation for why.<P>SkyStreak Cloudrider<BR>Wizard of the 51st Circle<BR>Bard lover<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well, I find this absolutely amazing, even before level 30 this song was useless after the secondary resists where added.  I just really hope they don't say Pixie Strike / Twilight is working as intended as well.  Twilight is a 51 song so I would think this is supposed to work after level 30  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">, as of right now I can't keep 1 easy blue mezzed for very long.  Another thing I find ironic is why is that charm is less resisted than Twilight? heh, you would think that a MOB would be more easily tricked into just staying out of combat then fighting for you!! Jeesh..<P>So I'm wondering where it says Lullaby is only supposed to be effective up to Level 30, I must have missed the documentation on that.  I'm sure its there, the song has been there since the begining of the game right? Verant, could you point me to that info? This song seems to be the exception to the rule in that all other songs improve with level, why where we not told this? Wait nevermind, never worked to start, why do I care.  <P>Sorry if I'm rambling, I'm just so amazed over this whole issue.  If Pixie/Twilight are treated the same way then I'm curious how much it would cost to file a suit against Verant for delivering a product that does not work as intended, or at the very least try to explain this thouroughly to the Better Business Bureau.  Anyone have any legal experience or have a friend that does? I would love to see how many people would band together on these issues, not only the Bard Class, but any class that has a legitimate complaint.  This is nuts, I've put 85 days X 24 hours into my Bard, and this is what I get.<P>I'll stop now, we need to organize, and do a bit more than just talk to Verant. Anyway, I'm going to look into what I can do, be posting again soon  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>To those who say lullabye needs to use mana in return for a lower resist rate.<P>Lullabye lasts 1 tick. You must continuosly sing this song to the exclusion of all other to keep stuff mezzed.<P>A bard has already sacrificed all the other things they could be doing in order to ae mezz (haste, reists buff, debuffs, dots). <P>If all an enchanter with clarity did was ae mezz/med they would gain mana. Then they would also be able to toss in a tash or maybe a slow. And the enchanter would've already had augment (haste and stat buff) on all the tanks, maybe even their AC and magic resist buffs as well. <P>Having lullabye work in it's original version (no secondary resist) would in no way make bards as good as enchanters. Either one could keep stuff mezzed indefinately. And enchanters could have buffed the tanks pre-fight whereas a bard would be unable to buff anyone. Enchanters could also throw in a few debuffs as well, while a bard could not.<P>All verant sees is 'no mana' and then does a half-assed balancing job without looking at the big picture.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>&gt; The song works with the percentage effectiveness that Verant wants it to.<P>That is debatable.  I cannot conceive how any sane person would consider a 70%-90% resist rate on blues to be acceptable.<P>&gt; And I think I understand why. You just can't have a no mana, continuous<BR>&gt; mez with a good chance of success. It's too powerful.<P>Yet that's exactly what enchanters can do, not with just 1-3 mobs, but 4-5 dependon on their level.<P>The whole mana/no-mana thing is a red herring kept alive by people who just don't understand the effect mana has on your ability to "cast" spells/songs.  It's a time-limit, that's all it is.  If you want to do comparisons, you need to do it in the time-domain, not the mana-domain.  The equivalent time-limit for bard songs is song duration/"cast" time.  We can only practically keep 3 songs up at once.  That's equivalent to an enchanter staying even on mana while keeping 3 mobs mezzed and doing NOTHING else (no buffs, no debuffs, no clarity, no haste, no damage).  Since they can already do this with 4+ mobs, the point is moot.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>For anyone new to the issue that doesn't understand what is going on, let me give you the rundown:<P>- The level 15 Bard song, called Lullabye, is an AE Mez.<P>- It is not as powerful as the level 16 Enchanter spell, Mesmerize, because it only lasts 3 seconds (all other songs last 9). This means the Bard playing it can do NOTHING else while playing it, and it has a chance to be resisted every 3 seconds, making it very dangerous to use.<P>- The Enchanter's Mesmerize costs so little mana that meditating while mes'ing will actually INCREASE their mana if they've casted Clarity on themselves. Bard's Lullabye costs 0 mana.<P>- In a patch last year, an unannounced nerf was made to all Bard mez songs.<P>- Bards suddenly noticed that their song SAID it was working but the mobs kept hitting them. After several months, they finally convinced GZ to do a public test in January 2000 to see what the problem was.<P>- This chat is available at http://www.eqsongs.com/NewsArchive/GZ_LullabyLog.htm<P>- During the chat GZ said that a secondary resist rate had been added to the song.<P>- The secondary resist rate had no message for it, so the song gave a successful message even when it failed. Upon discovering this, GZ figured that was the whole problem and had the message added 2 weeks later. The song STILL says it is successful, however, it ALSO says it has failed at the same time.<P>- During the chat, people asked GZ what the resist rate should be. GZ said about 25% on low cons (blue/green) and 35% on white cons. He didn't mention yellow/red.<P>- GZ also said CHA should lower this resist rate.<P>- Level 50 Bards ran tests and found that the resist rate against a level 1 mob was 35% and completely unaffected by high CHA<P>- They also discovered that the resist rate got worse as they tried against higher and higher mobs. The resist rate against exp-giving (blue con) mobs was about 70%.<P>- 70% resist rate checked every 3 seconds was fatal to the Bard.<P>- Bards complained until last month, Ester The Tester was set to test the song and find what was wrong with it.<P>- Ester admitted she was clueless on Bards and didn't know much about the issue.<P>- Ester later said she thought that since the song was level 15 it shouldn't still be effective against high level mobs.<P>- Bards explained that ALL spells and songs in the game have their resistance rates dependant on the level of the caster versus the level of the mob and the spell level was irrelevant.<P>- Case in point, Enchanters use their level 16 AE mez all the way up to 50 with consistent resist rates against blues. Same with Druids and their level 1 Snare.<P>- Ester never acknowledged these responses so Bards didn't know if she had heard.<P>- The next day, it was announced that the song was working as intended.<P>- Having already been told recently that the admittedly accidental nerf to Bard snare song would not be fixed, and having been looked over when the enhancements to the other Hybrids were made recently, the Bards were outraged.<P>- Many Bards quit EQ that day.<P>- Other classes agreed that the Bard Lullabye should be functional as Enchanters now have an unbalancing monopoly on Crowd Control. Even Enchanters showed their support, saying that they feel the Bard AE mez should work again.<P>- When asked why GZ would say one thing and then go back and say something else, Gordon replied that the snippets of chat log that he had been shown did not explicitly state which resistance GZ was referring too. The whole chat log does, of course, but Gordon had not read it.<P>- Gordon/Ester claimed that the song was not supposed to be effective above level 30 and that the Bard's single-target mez was the "upgrade" to the song. However, it is even weaker because it is single-target only and has the SAME high resist rate as Lullabye.<P>- Every other Bard song in our arsenal gets MORE powerful as we level, even our level 1 song is used by level 50 Bards, and this was the first time we had been told that one of our songs was supposed to be worthless post 30.<P>- The song is also worthless pre-30 because of the resist rates, but not as horribly.<P>- There is no other AE mez songs for Bards, so nothing to truly replace it post 30.  There is, however, a blank spot at level 49 that we have no song for.<P>- It has been suggested that since Verant's main concern is that the song doesn't use mana that mana use be added to it similar to the second Bard Charm song.  There has been no answer on this yet.<P>- The fact that CHA does nothing for the resistance rate at ANY level has not yet been addressed.<P>Zanen<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I feel special: Both my one-line replies were responded to in the Abashi mega-reply.  However, Abashi has always shown a great willingness to respond to one-line questions: They are easy.  Will he reply to gargantuan posts like the following though?<P>Abashi: &gt;&gt;&gt; In both cases I was able to mez the level one creatures a good percentage of the time. &lt;&lt;&lt;<P>What is "a good percentage"? Alot of bards in various posts spent a great amount of time posting data is precise form, including levels, trials, resists rates, charisma gear included, variables changed.  Please post your results in a similar amount of detail.  Give them the precise rates you were seeing and were content with.  The stats-happy bards want to be able to reproduce what you are seeing, and point out discrepancies - like CHA having an inverse effect from what is intended might be something you missed, for instance.  Tell them your vision of what rate is acceptable.  Tell them if and why that vision doesn't correlate to the oft-quoted GZ-snippet about 25/35.<P>Abashi: &gt;&gt;&gt; There is no way that we can make a no-mana song as powerful as a mez as good as a spell that uses mana, which is the reason that it was changed to its current state last August or so. &lt;&lt;&lt;<P>This statement seems incredibly out of tune with the other bard threads in the past.  I hate to reiterate work that was so well done by Kaearia at http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009372.html and other studious bards, but it is a fundamental misconception that "no mana" is equivalent to "no cost therefore unbalancing".  Bards have no mana, but they are just as limited as casters by how much they can cast and how often.  It's mathematically shown elsewhere that bards are the least efficient class in terms of mez_effect_output/player_time_input (given meditating and clarity).  The necessity of refreshes which cause additional resistance checks, the lack of a minimum duration, being locked out of performing any other actions, inability to "meditate up" a storage capacity of singing ability: All of these conspire against bards to such a great extent in terms of effectiveness that a secondary resist, especially one of such magnitude, does not have the effect of "reigning in the power of the song", rather it simply kills its usefulness entirely.<P>Abashi: &gt;&gt;&gt; I think that I've effectively addressed these issues above, but I'll elaborate. The original implementation of the song made it much too powerful considering its lack of a mana control. &lt;&lt;&lt;<P>Ouch, there you go again.  This is the reason I've harped in the past about wanting to know about the "Whys" that makes Verant come to decisions.  Your underlying theory here is broken.  The ONLY acceptable answer to "why do bards mezzes suck?" is: Bards' versatility requires them to be less powerful at some abilities, and significantly less powerful at other abilities: crowd control is the ability we decided to super-debuff.  Quoting "lack of mana is unbalancing" is a great, great disservice to bards.  BTW, why are we still allowed to run faster than SOW if that is your underlying philosiphy?<P>Abashi: &gt;&gt;&gt; What is at your disposal? What can you do? Where can you excel? That is our vision for the bard class. &lt;&lt;&lt;<P>What ever happened to "music soothes the savage beast"?  Thinking about my perception of the history of bards and what they have meant to role-playing games in the past, i.e., my "vision" of bards, I keep coming to the conclusion that Lullaby should be our best song!  Certainly not Clarity.  If you want to nerf something, nerf clarity; and take away the secondary resists on these songs that soothe the savage beast.  Crowd-control is a such a much more rewarding play experience than being a mana battery: Ask any enchanter.<P>Abashi: &gt;&gt;&gt; They are difficult to play well, and their name doesn't scream offensive power like some other classes.<P>Bards are difficult to play well, that is true, but so are enchanters, and because lots of people understand the power of enchanters many have chosen to play them.  The name comment hardly seems worth responding to; I don't think you really think that's a reason.  It should be obvious by now that people aren't so shallow as to ignore a class that has value, despite an unpowerful-sounding name.  "Druid" hardly screams offensive power, but people play the druid class in droves because it is slightly on the 'too good' side.<P>Abashi: &gt;&gt;&gt; Evidently the drum animations aren't in, or perhaps we don't have anything that looks like a drum when held. I've not personally looked at the appearance in game to see. &lt;&lt;&lt;<P>It's clear from this comment you've never played a bard.  Maybe you should try it.  Seriously, I'm not trying to zinger you here - it is a fun class.  1) You get great opportunities for role-playing, and 2) you reduce some of the minor frustrations people complain about in the game: travel time (selos) and downtime (hymn/clarity).  Personally, I could care less about the drum issue, I just want the songs bards get, especially since there are so few, to be at least mildly effective.<P>Abashi: &gt;&gt;&gt; Chains had the power to reduce the effective movement of a fleeing NPC to zero, causing it to be an effective root. However, were an actual root spell used, the NPC would have fought having no other option available (fight or flight). It had fleeing mobs at a dead stop, yet not fighting back. &lt;&lt;&lt;<P>Many players feel it's limited duration, its necessity of being refreshed, the refreshes leading to more resists, and the opportunity cost of casting it over something else, all adequately balanced out the fact that it had a few features over Snare.  This nerf has removed the decision-making process whereby groups that had both a Bard and a Snarer had to decide which one to us.  Now groups can unequivocally choose the Snarer without any qualms.  It also reduced some of the things a skillful bard could do to make his group more effective.  This unintentional nerf, later labeled as-intended, removed some of the gameplay of Everquest.<P>BTW, you are aware that fleeing MOBs still come to a stop at a certain percentage of health from other Snares, right?  So this "stopped un-fighting MOB is a fundamentally broken mechanic" can't really be your sole argument, can it?<P>Many bards: &gt;&gt;&gt; Song is useless. &lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>Abashi:  &gt;&gt;&gt; Is not! &lt;&lt;&lt;<P>Back it up please.  Play a bard, find a use for Lullaby that's better than any other option available (with any reasonable variant of group composition), and report back to us your findings.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>If you get this far down.<P>Mez can't be as powerful because it is mana-less..... ALL BARD SONGS ARE (minus 1 or 2...).  The whole idea is that a bard can only sing a few songs at a time, and he has to stop or he will die in combat (aggro).  But you can't use that as an excuse.<P>what you are saying is that since we don't have mana we cant mez a few creature.  I think this is a little rediculus.  If you didn't want us to use it the why give it to us.  <P>You are dropping our power consistantly over time.  The only things you aren't, is our buffing power.  This is the main complaint.  <P>Look at the spells as it goes up.  Then look at what we can do in combat.<P>How about instead making it un-twistable.  So when we use it we cna't stop (pretty much what it was).  Or maybe that we cant attack... but currently you have just removed a spell from us.  Thats it.  Its unusable in its current configuration in any realy way.  No tactics just a last ditch effort before a run.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Oh my goodness we have a number posted.<BR>From Ester over on QA<P>&gt;&gt;And you are absolutely correct under normal circumstances. However this spell was designed to NOT work on mobs over level 30. The resist rates on mobs under level 30 are around the 40% range.<BR>&gt;&gt;<P>Speaking as a bard under level 30, I would like to say that a 40% resist rate tested every tick is quite high.  Especially since this seems to be relative to blue/green MOB's.  You can't even whip this out vs. whites.  <P>3 MOBS:  6% chance of mezzing all 3<P>So I"m getting beating on 94% of the time?  And this is expected?  And this is useful?  <P>What happens when they land the bash?  Then I've got 3 beating on me. <P>I'm no enchanter, but if they get bashed while mezzing, their mobs don't wake up.  They have to beat a resist rate once per mob.  That's it.  <P>This is ridiculous VI.  Please get rid of that second resist. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

They<BR>                         then promise to fix the brake lights, since the car isn't stopping fast enough. 8 Months after<BR>                         that they say "oh yeah, yer brakes are working as intended" to which you respond "but I can<BR>                         only stop in time 1 out of every 3 times, I always get in an accident and injured or dead the<BR>                         other 2 times" and of course their response would be "Have an enchanter drive you around, their<BR>                         brakes work better"<P>                         Hard work is 400 times more effective when preceeded by intelligent, coherent thought.

</FONT><HR>There's nothing in the rules of conduct for the web site that says anything about flames.  Sorry, but flamming is open to interpretation as to what is and is not.<P>I think much of what Abashi says is assanine.  It shows his total lack of knowledge about the game.  It belittles the knowledge of the players.  Is this a flame?  Of course not, it is my opinion.<P>Now if I said Abashi was a stupid f'ing jerk (whether I really feel that way for not) is considered a flame and a personal attack and an insult.<P>But to say what I think of his comments as being assanine isn't, any more then saying that I think his comments are exceptionally on point or wonderful.  The point is that it is simply my opinion of what he has to say.<P>Now as for what I feel about Abashi in truth.  I really do feel that he's closer to the first description I gave then anything else.  He doesn't understand the game, the classes, nor the players.  What he says, especially on the subject of class balance and class envy is in itself inflammatory.<P>When he says that most fo the problems are class envy and not balance is an inflamming statement in my opinion.<P>Take it from someone that has a 43 bard, 38 warrior, 54 wizard, 51 ranger, and 55 necro.  Most of the issues put forth by the rangers are not class envy but true balance issues that make them less then desirable in groups and in general, play.<P>I play a bard and I think that the bard mez song is a non functional piece of junk.

</FONT><HR>Not sure if it is possible but some thought from reading through here...<P>Verrant's view of the situation is:<P>All mobs get a normal save, which is influenced by level (so the 50 vs. 1 should work almost all the time)<P>All mobs get a second save that is a much flatter 25-35% range depending on level & cha.<P>Players claim much higher resists (whether 1st or second not clear).  They also claim that in combat it is effectively useless.<P><BR>My view of the problem:<P>While the extra save is may be needed for game balance for the enchanter, all bardic opponents effectively get an extra save every 3-6 (depends whether bard tries twisting in another song) seconds.  <P>Solution #1:<BR>Perhaps the second save is needed for Bard's (since the creature will get another save much sooner than the enchanted creature would).  If need be raise the primary (or only) resist chance a little (may not be the best...)<P>Solution #2 (my preferred) Would it be possible to make it so that a resisted songs does not wipe the previous.  This would mean a bard NOT twisting would have two chances to keep the mob out of combat.  This would one greatly limit the effect (since you would not twist the song) while giving a fairer chance to keep three mobs out of combat (which an enchanter can do very easily and can surpass the bard by taking full trains out of combat), while still allowing a reasonable change for the bard to keep a few people quite.<P>Detailed analysis of problem:<BR>Not sure the length of an Enchanter Mez (haven't played one :-) lets be conservative (i hope) and say 30 seconds. So to keep (to my knowledge) an unlimited number of Mobs in an area quite the enchanter needs each creature to fail two saving throws over a period of 30(+) seconds.  The ones that make their save the enchanter will very easily be able to hit with individual mezs between the recast time, so the enchanter should be able to take out 5-6+ mobs until they run out of mana (if they would run out of mana if this is all the were doing with clarity up :-)<P>Now lets look at the bard.  The bard can play Lullaby (and I presume the rest though dont know from personal knowledge) and have a chance to take out up to four (never more) creature, with a theoretical 25% (at the 50-1 level difference) chance of each one resisting.  So far this is only slightly worse than the enchanter (who can supposedly take out unlimited if the are in range).  OK that sounds like a fair difference for the Masters and the secondary abilities.  However, it gets worse.  While the enchanter's mobs are out for 30+ seconds the poor bard is out for only 6 seconds (maybe a little more but less than 9).  So right off to keep the creatures quite the poor bard has to make at least 5 'casts' so their is a total of 10 saves for the mobs to resist  clearly the bard is going to be taking a lot more hits than the chanter.<P>So the Enchanter can keep multiple mobs out of combat for extended periods with about 25% of them getting a chance to hit the enchanter, but the enchanter will get chance to take them out individually.<P>The bard can try to keep a maximum of 4 creatures out of combat (but most likely) 1 (and any mobs over 4 in the group) will be attacking the bard...  The bard has no real chance to take the individual mobs out of the fight and can only make another overall attempt, which if the percentages are correct will result in 1+(every mob in group past the fourth) to attack the bard.<P>So even if the percentages are correct the bard is limited by:<BR>a) can't control as many as the enchanter (fine limiting balance), <BR>b) Has no option to remove the ones that make their saves like the enchanter.<BR>c) Really can do nothing else while holding the creatures off (unlike chanter who should be able to make casts in between refresh (or re-med to keep it up for ever)) (acceptable limitation for the secondary class)<P>'a' & 'c' seem like very decent limitation for a class that is the secondary class at crowd control surely nobody that has an enchanter would what to live with the limits so it is not a threat towards the enchanter<P>'b' Seems to make it near useless to a group even without an enchanter.  Sure you expect to get hit some (risk) but the enchanter will get hit for a round or two by some of the mobs and then have several that they are free of threats to be healed, buff, or even fall back so it is more likely when the spell breaks the creature attack the tanks :-)  The bard on the other hand is going to get hit each and every round (unless there is a MEGA-taunter in the group) by at least one of the mobs (presuming less than 4) and if there are more than 4 by 1 + the number over 4.  This will not be for a round or two while the quite the resistant ones, but until they are all killed or the bard is removed from the scene (dead or zoned).<P><BR>Anaylsis of solutions:<P>1) This would take the songs back to their old status (of which nobody seems to have had major problems), if it is seen that this would be unbalancing with the lessened enchanter songs, than raise the single resist a little to offset.  This would mean in a chance wear there were less than 4 mobs the bard would be about the same as the enchanter IF the bard did nothing else, while the enchanter could still have time to do other things.  That would still seem to be a fair balance for the secondary class, a limited number effected and the only thing the bard can do.<P>2) This would be my personal favorite.  It would still make it very likely the bard is going to take hits, just not EVERY round.  If the bard was doing nothing else he should be able to keep 4 mobs out of the fight with only taking a hit every few rounds.  The enchanter would be in much the same situation with the bonus of the fact the could keep more than 4 mobs out of the fight and they could do other things in between recasts.<P><BR>As a low level bard I think I would more than be satisfied with either of these two solutions (even if neither was quite as good as it was before).  What do the rest of you think?<P>Gordon (and any other that wish to speak from VI) would these go against the vision?  Would either of these be possible from a coding standpoint?<P><BR>Thanks (and sorry for the length :-)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

And even if we had the same ability to brake as<BR>                         them, ours would still be less effective.<P>                         In the car analogy you can assume that Enchanters have anti-lock brakes, as they can just push<BR>                         the pedal and stop as fast as possible. Bards however do not have anti lock brakes, if they<BR>                         want to stop fast, they have to pump the brakes, once every tick. This makes it harder to stop<BR>                         the car (mez something), and is in line with Abashi's statement that bards should have to rely<BR>                         on their dexterity on the keyboard to be more effective.<P>                         However, not only do bards not have anti lock brakes, they have worn pads, rotors that are<BR>                         ground way past the safe point and about half the required brake fluid.<BR>                         I used the brakes for the analogy as they are one of the most important parts of any car, the<BR>                         same as mez is one of the most important bard songs.<P>                         So for the love of god, give us new pads, rotors, calipers and a full tank of brake fluid, hell<BR>                         even an off brand, just so that when we "pump" the brakes we have a chance to stop. The<BR>                         enchater will still "stop" faster and easier. But at least every attempt at driving won't end<BR>                         embedded in a brick wall when a bard is at the wheel.<P>                         I hope this has cleared up the reasons why we think you are insanse for claiming "working as<BR>                         intended".

He/She is mainly there to get<BR>                         orc pawn pics for the Guard Valon quest in west commons. The bard see's a newbie running to the<BR>                         guards with 2 or more orc pawns, some of them holding pics. So the bard runs over and<BR>                         intercepts the mobs by playing lullaby. Whether or not they get mezzed (the numbers say 2 of 6<BR>                         will, maybe) they will aggro on the bard. He can now kill them and harvest the orc pawn pics,<BR>                         rather than have them lost forever to the hand of a guard. YAY!! Thank god we got this song or<BR>                         we might have to wait for more pawns to spawn so we can get their pics.<P>                         Yes, I have riddled these posts with sarcasm, but I am also dead serious about the analogy,<BR>                         people with any amount of brain cells numbering 2 or more just cannot understand how the<BR>                         intended effect of a song is to fail 40+% of the time from the day we get it. On top of that<BR>                         because of the nature of the song, any mob level 5+ that is not mezzed on the first try will<BR>                         bash us and the rest will wake up.. So unless all get mezzed the first tick, there is added<BR>                         probability that we won't be able to re-mez the others on the next try as we'll be stunned.<P>                         Remember the big post we had on possibility vs. probability? I know you know how to do the<BR>                         math, please consider the blatantly ignored factors of this song, I.E. the effects it gives to<BR>                         future attempts when it fails once.<P>                         There is only one thing that needs to be done to this song.

</FONT><HR>SammyUK-Bristlebane: I disagree with most of your points about the bard's usefulness.  The wide variety of tricks are great, because when I'm in a group with a bard, we can cover for each other--I like that.  The bards I've grouped with who have droned the manasong drove me insane.  Woo, I had more mana to recast chloro and alacrity on everyone over and over.  Blah.<P>Some (many?) of a bards tricks are inferior to other classes' versions of them, such as snare.  But bards get ALL the tricks--I wish I had a half-assed snare, but I'm stuck with only root, for example.  The problem I see is that claiming necromancers fill the "secondary enchanter" role because of a single spell is very silly indeed.  Multiple classes can fulfill the healing role in place of a cleric, all casting classes have some form of direct damage which is to a large or small degree worse than a wizard's, several classes can tank when there's no warrior around, etc.  The bard mez songs were already worse than enchanters, but at least they existed.  In their current form, they are not worth scribing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>hey abashi, (sorry not good at spelling) All i've seemed to notice here is a constant thread among almost all classes that they can not go out and power level themselves.  I know i haven't been playing really long (only about 2-3 months) but i've worked my wizard up to almost 16, and am working on other classes, i have learned the intracate art of self leveling, but what the bards and others fail to relise is the fact not EVERYthing can be done by yourself, if your group can't take on those 6 mobs, then try ot pull a little safer, or go find that missing part to your group so you can take on those 6 mobs. I for one understand what VI is trying to acomplish and i suport it fully i wanted to say keep up the good work, because if it had been easy for me to play this game and to level i never would have stayed on with the game past the first month.<P>sorry i know i'm long winded  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Finien 16th Wizard &lt;forever untamed&gt;<BR>Uern 5th Enchanter<BR>Fanyan 3rd Paladin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>"Working as intended"... what a classic (I don't have a clue) response. If it's not supposed to work on things over 30th, then why don't we have a new song that does exactly the same thing at 31st? Songs are supposed to retain their usefulness, no matter how old they are. How many bards out there still use the 1st level Chant of Battle sometimes? (sees a few hands go up) What about 6th level Hymn of Restoration? (all hands go up) 5th level Accelerando? (hands stay up, except a few 51st+ bards)<P>The point to this is, all of our songs should have a function no matter what level we are. I can put to good use nearly every single song in my book, save Mellifluous Motion and this pathetic mez line. Just imagine if all of our songs were useful for a few levels, then they stopped working. We'd be a bunch of slow, useless lumps of flesh with a small handful of neat party tricks.<P>Maybe after a song is 10 or 15 levels old, it should just erase itself from our book, huh Verant?? At least then we wouldn't have to flip pages or stare at that icon that reminds us of a nice ability we used to have, or still can as long as we're not gaining xp.<P>What should the bards level 32-52 do? I suppose we should just avoid dungeon groups unless we have an enchanter or good monk puller with us. Bottom line: if these songs work "as intended" then they SUCK. I wouldn't even recommend a young bard to waste his platinum on them.<P>Angry as hell,<P>------------------<BR>Nexroth, student of the Victorious Verse<BR>Senior Senator of the Oracle of Virtue<BR>Cazic-Thule server<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>  They are going to still be looking into Pixie and Twilight? Well bah! You all knew lullaby would never be fixed these are where our hope lies.  Lets get these working like a standard enchanter enthrall...10%ish resist rate lasts guarenteed 18 seconds.  That means we can do 3 max, get hit (and bashed) 10% of the time, take some more damage, then get them back under control.  Thats still worse than an enchanter, but acceptable.<P>  Secondly, you can't give "mana requirement" as a reason to do anything involving bards.  The reason is, bards have been balanced on a seperate scale from everyone else.  Same abilities (or should be, designed to be, but don't actually HAVE those abilities) but different limitations.  There's no "saving up" for a bad pull.  We are as effective during a 10-mob fight as in a single mob fight, we can't mana burn or evac, or chain heal the dying ranger.  We have DOWNSIDES aside from a mana requirement, that being a constant refreshing of our songs vs a mana requirement.  A limit of 3 per once vs a limit of one bar of mana at once.<P>  Trilian Soulwind</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Zanen,  good points. Not sure if you were expecting a response from Verant but it won't happen.  It might require insightful thinking and so far that hasn't been done.  In my opinion Abashi has been flippant in the handling of this matter.  I'd hazard to guess that he wants it to go away.<P>-Elendel</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Actually I quit playing my bard a few months ago, and just picked him back up.  I dual play currently a 40 bard or a mage and a 49 cleric, and the bard is great for a space filler in the group.  However I can't get him close to mobs or he gets instadeath since he is made out of glass.  Even if I throw naltron, resolution, and shield of words he is still a pansie.  I'm pretty much leveling him now just to help with resists on dragons etc because he is useless otherwise except for selos and clarity.  I imagine I'll level him to 46 or so then just pull him out for big raid resists.  No big deal, but I'm a cleric and after 45 it's not even worth wasting heals on a bard in a serious encounter because they will drain me faster than a rogue whithout a good taunter on the other side.  I'll just res my bard after the fight is over and save mana.  I feel sorry for real bards because they miss so much fun stuff because they get killed so fast.<BR>(my cleric takes a LOT better beating than a bard)<P><BR>This isn't meant for a flame, I just understand the role of a bard is to be a gimp and a soso support role.  They are great to have for a few things such as dragon raids, but their clarity really doesn't do that great unless you stack it on enchanter clarity.  Anyways they make a great space filler if you absolutely can't find another class to go into thier spot.<P>Oh and as to what a true bard is.  I would suggest someone from VI read a very very very good book about a bard, written by Hans Beeman.  It's called The Stone and the Flute.  A true bard as far as epic storytelling is concerned is just about nothing BUT an enchanter.  The same thing in folklore as in RP etc is that music much like in real life magically makes people feel different.  The songs that have always annoyed me were the DD songs and dot songs etc.  Bards should be kept to fear, speed, mesmirize etc songs if they are to be kept true to what a bard is supposed to be.  However I am sure that bards were put in as kind of an afterthought and the testing of bards must be a very hard chore, since it doesn't seem they know much about this class at VI.  I only say this because of things like the flute graphic instead of the drum graphic that people have been making fun of since I started this game.  Now they say they didn't notice this????? LOL.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Abashi wrote:<P>&gt;&gt;There is no way that we can make a no-mana song &gt;&gt;as powerful as a mez as good as a spell that &gt;&gt;uses mana, which is the reason that it was &gt;&gt;changed to its current state last August or so.<P>&gt;&gt;I think that I've effectively addressed these &gt;&gt;issues above, but I'll elaborate. The original &gt;&gt;implementation of the song made it much too &gt;&gt;powerful considering its lack of a mana &gt;&gt;control.<P>Well here is the crux of the issue i think, Verant doesn't know how to balance a no-mana spell.  It seems like the person who designed bard songs (GZ i assume) did understand it at one time, for example stating that keeping multiple song effects up at once was an intended ability.<P>What is mana for?  It is there to limit the number of effects a caster can keep going in any period of time.  For example, a shaman can keep all their stat buffs up but at the expense of their offensive/healing abilities.  Over time a caster can only expend as much mana as they med back.  The limit on Bard songs is the duration and casting time, as mentioned previously on this thread.<P>Addressing Lullaby, i will run through some numbers using a hypothetical situation.  Suppose a group pulls 4 creatures and proceeds to fight one while the bard uses Lullaby to mez three of them.  This song lasts for such a short time that it must be the ONLY song sung (this is the proper trade off for no mana cost, not increased resists).  With a primary resist rate of ~5% and secondary resist rate of ~35%, as per the testing done by Kaearia and other bards, you could expect to successfuly mez a mob .95*.65 or ~61% of the time.  So, for 3 mobs you could expect to mez all three on one pulse of the song .61^3 or 23% of the time.  Now, suppose it takes your group 30 seconds to kill that fourth mob they have engaged, this means Lullaby will pulse 5 times (every 6 seconds), so your chance of keeping all 3 mobs mezd for the entire time is .23^5 = .0007, or .07%!  So in this case the song will work less than one-tenth of one percent of the time.  <P>The reason I used an example of a four mob pull in the above is because a level 27+ bard can crowd control with charm in the case of a 2-3 mob pull.  Why did i work through all those numbers?  To demonstrate that the song is indeed broken.  The equivalent Enchanter spell, Enthrall (a level 16 spell which is useful to level 50 and beyond, whereas our level 15 song is only intended to work up to level 30 *boggle*), has a maximum duration of 48 seconds.  So to get an ACCURATE comparison of enchanter and bard resists the resist rate of *one* cast of Enthrall should be compared to *eight* casts of Lullaby, since that's how many casts it would take to keep a mob mezd for the same period of time (works out to 99.999%, seriously).  Even if Lullaby only had it's 5% primary resist rate, to keep 3 mobs mezd for 48 seconds the overall success rate would only be ~30%.  Can you understand now why the secondary resists on bard mez songs make them entirely useless?<P>&gt;&gt;Chains had the power to reduce the effective &gt;&gt;movement of a fleeing NPC to zero, causing it &gt;&gt;to be an effective root. However, were an &gt;&gt;actual root spell used, the NPC would have &gt;&gt;fought having no other option available (fight &gt;&gt;or flight). It had fleeing mobs at a dead stop, &gt;&gt;yet not fighting back.<P>I had to throw in a comment on this, even though it is off the topic.  Do you *really* play a necro, Abashi?  If you did then surely you would have known that ALL spells with a movement reduction effect cause a fleeing NPC to stop and not fight back at some point.  Snare-type spells have *always* been considered more useful than root for this very reason.  Chains was a bit more effective in that at level 38 and above, the point at which a mob would stop fleeing was at half HP.  This effectiveness was offset by the need to cast it repeatedly.  It is now nearly useless as both a movement and attack speed slowdown, since it overwrites other classes snares.    Not only that, but we have to wait till level 23 to gain the ability to snare, whereas other snare classes get this ability earlier (Necro + Druid at level 1, Ranger level 9, Shadow Knight level 15, Wizards being the exception getting Bonds of Force at level 29).<P>Well, I hope someone out there finds this post to be useful.<P>Takeshi</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>PEOPLE!  Calm down!<P>So lullaby isn't too hot after 30.  How many casters out there still use spells they got at a level as low as mez song.  <P>Learn adapt live and have fun.<P>  Pixie strike is such a better spell in many ways.  Most people don't like it because it requires a little more thought and &gt;work&lt; to use.. however it is one powerful song, that if worked correctly can keep mobs mezzed for an almost indefinate ammount of time, all with zero mana.
