I know this isn't that good of a weapon anymore, but this is what monks are suppose to be known for.  The fist need to be worked on tremendously.  they need to get better damage\delay ratio.  Also a monk shouldn't be worrying about weapons.  A monk is known for fist.  This should be brought back to the game.  YEs there is many other areas that need to be fixed in a monk but this is a very important one.  A monks fist should be one of the most important things, some way they need to be made better.<BR>lvl 25 monk<BR>Tallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'd just like to give an anecdote that describes the "frenzy" problem with FD, describing what happened my last trip to the fire giants:<P>Wandering fire giant got away, pathed weird and brought back a few friends, including Skarlon and Tranix:<P>Puller tries to FD, "has fallen to the ground", tries again, "has fallen to the ground", becomes an integral part of the floor as he's stomped into the ground and dies.<P>We realize that there's no way to beat this, the clerics camp out, I try to FD right after, "has fallen to the ground", again, "has fallen to the ground", again, "has fallen to the ground", the mangled mess that used to be a monk dies.<P>So far, no problem with this. Except a general suspicion that the random number generator might need some work, but that's about it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>So we tried again, and ran into the same problem, and right after the puller dies, some people camp out, but I figure I can FD so I try and tank the mobs while they're camping, I turn autoattack off, wait a second, FD, at which point I'm at 50% health or so. Ooh, success! Or so I thought, since I didn't "fall to the ground", but Tranix and Skarlon were still beating on me. Turn autoattack on, wait for 8 seconds or so, turn autoattack off, wait a second, FD. Ooh, only 8 hps left, but at least I've succeeded! LOADING, PLEASE WAIT....<P>My network connection is quite good, I don't really need to wait as long as I do after turning attack off before FDing (I've tested this before), so it wasn't the network delay that causes this.<P>AoE spells break FD, resisted spells break FD, FD doesn't work unless you turn autoattack off, FD on level 32+ wanderers doesn't memblur most of the time, FD doesn't successfully lower you on the hate list most of the time, you can't FD successfully even when the skill check succeeds... the monk class isn't exactly uber to start out with, especially given the severe weight limit up to 55 and relatively low hps. Obviously FD could easily be made into an overpowering ability, but at the present time it seems like it's a little in the opposite direction especially for 50+ mobs.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am concerned about the few loud people who dislike monks using weapons.  I think their ideas mainly stem from old DnD rules.  In the old DnD rules monks were mainly hand to hand fighters.  What I see in film and books, however, is that monks almost always had some sort of staff or club that they used.  So I think that their ideas of what monks should be and are, are biased.  <BR>    Personally I think that monks do not have enough good items to quest after.  The good weapons that are offered monks give them something to do other than leveling.  <BR>    If we make weapons better than fists, then no one will use fists.  If you make fists better than weapons, no one will use weapons.  Either way will limit the diversity of the game.  The best way to handle this issue is to make the damage dealt by fists roughly equal to that dealt by weapons.  <P>    It would be great if gloves modified the damage that monks did.  This could really help balance the damage diffrence between fists and weapons, and it would make monks a more questable class.  If we need a real life situation for this to make sence, think of a pair of gloves with brass knuckes sown in.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have seen countless posts comparing Monk offense/damage and Warrior offense/damage.  Monks and Warriors are comparable on their current offensive skills.  The biggest point of difference comes from their defensive abilities.  Warriors are built to absorb a great deal of damage (highest hit points).  Monks *should* be built to avoid a great deal of damage (improved dodge, improved block, etc).  FD doesn't avoid damage ... it avoids combat all together.<P>The problem is that Warriors and Monks seem to have nearly the same defensive skills (Defense, Dodge, Parry/Block, Riposte, etc.) throughout their entire lives.  The monk has a *natural* boost to AC when using almost no armor and carrying no equipment, the warrior is more than able to compensate for this by using massive amounts of armor without the carrying capacity restrictions.<P>Since the focus always seems to be increasing the damage output for monks, they will also be greatly increasing their taunt factor.  The Warriors are built to deal with a MOB swinging at them for extended periods of time ... Monks are not.<P>There should be more focus placed on the avoidance of damage for Monks.  They would be able to fill their *nich* by avoiding being hit more often, while the Warrior would continue to fill their *nich* by absorbing damage.<P>If you want to balance Monks and allow them to be a viable Melee class, look at improving their defensive abilities.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Just a few comments, please read them.<P>Absor, you're doing a great job. I just have a few comments. Please do try to understand our concerns, you've done a much better job so far than I'd given you credit for. The list as it stands is fine, but there are four things I want to point out in particular.<P>1) I agree with Chickenleg's suggestion about scaling up the damage tables for Monks. That is a very good idea, and it solves our problem without causing 50 more farther down the road. Please look into that.<P>2) You missed some of the point about Feign Death. We MUST be able to use it to drop aggro. A small fixed amount doesn't sound like a good idea, and it's too close to rogues. Our solution should be unique. Also FDing 30 times a fight is a pain... I have a better idea.<P>  For every X seconds you spend FD, you lose Y amount of aggro/hate. If you stay down for an extended period of time, say 3 minutes for example, you get a complete and TOTAL, no failure memory wipe on all mobs, except perhaps God level MoBs... they are gods after all. This should still leave us our current chances that a MoB will completely forget us, just add this feature on top of it.<P>This solves the problem of /quitting out of the game, now we can just stay down to do it. It also lets us avoid getting our butts kicked hard in combat... just go down and stay down for a bit and the MoB will get off you... then you can get up, back out of the fight and recover.<P>Unfortunately it doesn't help us to stay in the fight, but seriously isn't this just an aggro management problem? Verant wants us to learn to manage aggro... after all, what happens to a wizzy that unloads his whole mana bar on a MoB? It comes after him, and only him. If we don't back out of a fight for a bit, is it so surprising that the MoB comes after us?<P>Also, please fix the big FD bug for us. I have 3 MoBs chasing me, I FD and watch them run in and start beating on me. No failure message. If I see no failure message, then those MoBs leave. Period, end of story. Either add a message saying they didn't buy it or make it work properly so that they DO buy it.<P>3) This one is only indirectly related to Monks. The Pantherskin armor is very tough to make. That's fine, it is very good armor, even if it is too heavy :P. The problem that I found is that, as a human, I have NOTHING to practice my tailoring on from 115 (quivers are trivial) except for items like the Pantherskin that don't trivial until somewhere around 200. Would you please look into adding just a few items for tailoring that would help us practice our way up to 200? Items that everyone can make, preferably. It's a bit like climbing a ladder only to find out that the top half of the ladder doesn't have any rungs on it at all.<P>4) In my opinion, you are being a bit elitist about only giving the weight bonus to 50+ Monks. I'll be joining their ranks soon enough, but even so I wish you would really give the lower level Monks a break. Throw them a bone here. Have the weight limit go up by 0.2 stone per level, and spread that out over the whole game. 1 stone every 5 levels is not that much of a change, and it would end with us having a 26 stone limit at 60th. If you want to give out larger bonuses after 50th that's fine too, but I'd personally prefer that the weight changes be spread out and very gradual.<P>I like the idea of giving a Monk a bonus if he is at extremely low weight, for one good reason: It almost totally frees us from having to worry about gear. Throw on a set of cured silk and you're good to go until 40th or so. That, combined with incresed fist damage (scale the tables) would make a monk free from worry about gear and loot.<P>Thanks again Absor.<BR>Raviel Darkfyre<BR>Servant of the Tranquil<BR>46 Monk, Luclin<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have read most of these posts, and one thing that I have not seen addressed is the "vision" for monks.  I think it would be very helpful for you (Absor) to tell us what the "vision" is (not only for monks but for all classes).<P>I know that when I first started playing EQ the "vision" for the monk was the master of melee damage.  Not only were we to be the masters of melee damage, but we were supposed to be able to do this with our bodies.  Please let us know what the "new vision" of monks is.  Also let us know if this is going to be the final vision of monks.  I get tired of trying to "hit a moving target".  If you will tell us what monks are supposed to be, we can decide if we want to continue to play them.  <P>In the beginning I thought the visions (melee only) were as follows:<BR>1.  Warrior - most hit points (basically a punching bag with average defense and damage)<BR>2.  Paladins - high hit points (not as high as warriros) but with better defense than a warrior's defense and average damage.<BR>3.  SK - high hit points (about same as Pally) but with better damage output than warrior and average defense.<BR>4.  Ranger - Medium hitpoints (less than Pally) but with better defense and damage.<BR>5.  Monk - Medium hitpoints (a little less than Ranger) but with better defense and best damage.<BR>6.  Rogue - They were just messed up.<P>Am I wrong in my estimation of how Verant perceived the classes?  If so, what was the original vision?<P>When Kunark came out, I think you all lost sight of the various visions.  The various melee classes should have been given equipment which emphasized their defining traits with marginal enhancements to their deficiencies.  What you all did for Warriors is to make them the end all and be all of the melee class.  They have the highest Hitpoints yet their defense and damage is only marginally less than THE BEST!  Monks now have marginally less than the best damage and nowhere near THE BEST defense and nowhere near the THE BEST hitpoints.  I truely believe you need to come up with a clear vision of what each class is supposed to be and then LET US KNOW!<P>One other point.  From all that I have read so far, there is a real danger of having only 4 viable classes in the "end game" (these classes being Warrior, Cleric, Enchanter, and Rogue).  If possible, I would like for you to address this issue.  In particular I want to know how Verant sees a monk's role in the "end game" and how it is viewed as "balanced" to a Warriors.<P>If you will address the core issue, "visions" for each class, I think your balancing issues will become self evident.  Your remedies may not be popular, but at least people will know what their characters' roles are.  Much better to get this out into the open.<P><BR>Govols <BR>Monk level 24<BR>Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>here is a paste from an EXCELLENT article about TAUNTING and HATE LISTS and why monks need much more damage output to make up for their lack of TAUNT skill<P>remember... im not asking for a TAUNT skill... im simply pointing out the fact that it is a DEFICIENCY for our class that makes us less desirable for grouping<P>if you dont believe me please read carefully:<P>---------------------<P>How Hate is calculated:<BR>                            This is something most tanks and casters understand. Hate for melee is generally based on two variables, the<BR>                            speed of the weapon and the potential damage of the weapon (This is why quad misses taunt just as well as<BR>                            quad max's). Casters also deal with this in the form of spells in addition to worrying about effects that create<BR>                            extra hate. Snare, stun, debuffs, etc.<P>                            How Taunt works:<BR>                            Taunt (when successful) seems to have a few rules binding it. It will either take the taunter to just beyond<BR>                            the current highest person on the hate list, or if the difference is too great, will increase their position on the<BR>                            hate list a certain number of points. This is just speculation based on observation of playing this game since<BR>                            launch. It may be inaccurate, but observations seem to fit with taunt working in this manner.<P>                            Taunting off of another melee'r:<BR>                            In this scenario, lets assume that only two tanks are in the fight. No other casters will make an appearance.<BR>                            (This isn't all that uncommon in exp fighting since no in combat heals will be needed). Tank one is the<BR>                            designated meat shield. Tank two is not taunting (or can't), but his/her weapon configuration is such that<BR>                            he/she will generate more hate over time than tank one. The fight starts, assuming tank one pulled (I've<BR>                            observed that the first one on the hate list seems to get a hate bonus, this may be false), tank one will be<BR>                            taking the hits. Eventually however, tank two will surpass tank one on the hate list. The mob switches over to<BR>                            tank two. At this point, tank one taunts the mob. But the difference in hate between the two tanks is fairly<BR>                            small, therefor taunt doesn't increase tank one's hate very much. Very soon after, the mob switches back to<BR>                            tank two, where it will stay until taunt ungreys. Repeat until tank two or the mob is dead.<P>                            Taunting off of a Caster:<BR>                            While casters do get added to the hate list in pretty much the same way melee's do, the pattern of those<BR>                            hate increases is vastly different. Melee adds hate steadily in small chunks, casting adds occasionally in large<BR>                            chunks. Lets assume the same scenario above, but substitute tank two for a caster. The tank has just<BR>                            engaged in combat. The caster being an overzealous wizard lets say, casts a fairly big nuke. The wizard has<BR>                            just surpassed the warrior in the hate list by a big margin. Luckily, the warrior taunts successfully, bringing him<BR>                            past the wizards position in the hate list by increasing his hate rating by a significant amount. The wizard isn't<BR>                            likely to be stupid enough to cast another nuke right away, so it is likely that taunt will be available for the<BR>                            next time the wizard surpasses the hate of the warrior.<P>                            Taunting in a party situation:<BR>                            Lets bring tank two from the first situation and add him into the second. Tank one pulls, Tank two surpasses<BR>                            tank one. Tank one doesn't taunt because he knows that the wizard will probably nuke early again. True to his<BR>                            nature, the wizard pops in a big nuke, surpassing even tank two by a large margin. Tank one now taunts, and<BR>                            surpasses the wizard by a small margin and tank two by a large margin. Tank two will be fairly safe from<BR>                            attack until the difference in hate generation between his/herself and tank one accumulates enough to<BR>                            surpass tank one's hate.<P>                            Party without Taunts:<BR>                            This is what monks are worried about. Monks don't have a way to jump up the hate scale rapidly since they<BR>                            do not have taunt. If the wizard were to cast early with only a monk around to pull it off, that monk can only<BR>                            get the agro back if his/her potential damage surpasses the amount of potential damage that nuke had. Now<BR>                            lets plop in say 1500 hate points that complete heal would generate on a monk (assuming 1hp - 1 hatepoint).<BR>                            Will the monk be able to generate that much hate fast enough? Hopefully the monk was already at 1200 hate<BR>                            before that cast, otherwise the cleric may be dead.<P><BR>                            Taunting is so much more than playing whack-a-mole with the taunt key. Taunting involves knowing what the<BR>                            wield and when to push that taunt button. Getting the mob back off a secondary tank with taunt right when<BR>                            you see A_Wizard_24 casting ice comet in the first 30 seconds of the fight isn't a good use for it. Know that<BR>                            when you're the only warrior in a group, putting away your wurmslayer and grabbing that SSoY will make you<BR>                            a better asset to your group.<P>                            Pardon my grammar and spelling.<P><BR>-----------------------<P>this person has much more patience to detail it out than i ever will, but it is essentially the same argument<P>im too abrasive to sugar-coat my responses for you candy-azzes</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

To fix the problem, you can make all mobs walk back at the same time from a dead(or supposively dead) person (making it impossible to feign pull).

</FONT><HR>I agree with everything chickenlegs says except for one thing, rogues do not get the taunt skill, although poking something in the back for several hundred damage at a time without evading has roughly the same effect as a powerful taunt.. they don't actually have taunt skills.<P>Monks used to be the #1 skill based melee, meaning their skills far surpassed any other melee, while other melees depended on weapons and armor to excel, monks depended on skills, and the game was balanced, although at that time monks held the #1 toe to toe damage dealer position.  Kunark came out and the skill levels of the other melees grew, as did the weapon choices, while monks stagnated, although monks got a few weapons, most of which the other melee classes could use, meaning monks are no better than a warrior, damage or skill wise. However warriors, have more hit points, more armor and better a selection of weapons.  This is why monks need a change.  There is NO reason to take a monk over a second warrior or a 2nd rogue, aside from friendships.  Monks need to shine as much as any other class does, the need for naked low hit point warriors without taunt just isn't out there.<P>First look at the "Vision" for monks, find out what it is, then tell us what it is.  Most of the monks would certainly like to know what it is.<P>Next take chickenleg's post to heart about damage tables for monks, if it is possible, significantly boost the damage for monks via this table, if that isn't possible, then look at some of the various monk options such as off hand damage bonus.<P>Also I get a bit confused when i read warriors stating they are they masters of melee and monks stating they are.  What does the "Vision" say about this?  I think it is clear that currently, monks are not the master of melee, are they suposed to be?  If not, what are they sposed to be the masters of.<P>Absor said that there were reasons the fd code was changed to put in the level 32 mob forgetting thing in.  Well my return statement is, a LOT has changed since that was implimented, warriors have armor that far surpasses any monk's skill bonuses at lower levels, what used to be the best 1hs weapon available can now easily be afforded by any level 20 non-twink, rogues have cheap weapons and armor that far surpass what was previously available.  Every class can achieve 10 more levels above what was then possible, rangers bard, shadowknights all have spells that make them shine in light of their parent classes.  Monsters now can have a million hit points!  Norath is a dynamic world and many changes in the world have taken place since that non-dynamic change was made and while it might have been fitting then (though i don't think it was then either), there are so many reasons why it should be re-evaluated.<P>As for one feign death note, about it dropping 50 points of agro on feign.  Please consider that that is 1 round of attacks by a monk or less, this would do next to nothing for the monk, thats like expecting to balance the monk damage wise by expecting to uncouple the foot and hand special attacks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>BALANCING THE MONK CLASS<P>I have been reading though a lot of these posts and decided to list here some of my favorite points and some of my own suggestions.  This would make it easier for Absor to read as well (although he may not read it at all, considering its on page 5 or something like that).  I will however, post it on other forums to hopefully get them across to the Verant team.<P>POINT I-damage output<BR>I agree with chickenlegs on his damage table idea.  It will be one of the easiest ways to keep the classes balanced.  A new warrior weapon comes out with an insane dmg/delay ratio?...Just make it all/all or create a similar monk weap..as long as they are the samd dmg/delay, the monk will always come out on top.  Another way, perhaps even easier to balance would be to give monks a stackable natural haste on weapons as well as fists. If we have a 50 percent stackable natural haste, we will always be doing at least 50 percent more dmg then the warrior as long as the weapons are similar.  I also agree that the monk should do at least 50 percent more dmg then the warrior.  At this point, we are at least 50 percent weaker then warriors in defense..maybe even weaker...that includes hit points.  A 50 percent defense deficiency should warrant a 50 percent offence superiority.  (Not to mention that the speed boosts would make us look damn cool! hehe)<P>POINT II-fd rediscovered<BR>Now with the higher dmg, we will be getting hit a lot more, to lower ourselves in the hate list, why not just return fd to its original glory?  When every monk was proud to have it as their greatest skill.  Let FD completely erase the hate list.  I believe the reason why this was even changed was because Verant did not want us feign pulling (I may be wrong but I am pretty sure), but didnt Verant recently change the MOBs so that they will walk back in groups?  If they didnt they should.  Wouldnt this by itself rid us of feign pulling?  Returning FD to its original state would satisfy half the monks who post on these boards complaining how there is no way for them to lower aggro.  It would also make the game more fun for us monks...who enjoys fding 20 times just to lose aggro on a mob?  Or /q and reloging?  Or even taking a fd nap while waiting for another group member to rise above us in the hate list?  This just plain takes away from the fun of the game, not to mention the fact that without something similar to this, our dmg changes will make no sense,we will be forced to keep our dmg output low anyway just to reduce aggro.  <BR>-Also FD is currently horribly bugged, beneath 2 bubs of health, and while party members are attacking a mob, there seems to be almost no capability for a succesful fd.  I have also read of other instances of it failing...the code needs to be looked at.<BR>-Please give us a message to let us know that fd has failed.  I know it may not seem realistic for us to automatically know if the mob is fooled.  But because of us remaining on standing view we can not see the mobs attacking us...so this does lead to a need for a message such as this.  Sure we can switch camera views...but it takes too long and it would be easier to just wait until we take that first hit.  The XXXX has fallen to the ground message is just not cutting it anymore.<P><BR>POINT III-armor<BR>Please look at the monk only armor pieces and make them worth getting over all/all armor.  Or at least make them equal to them.  Also please give us some new looks on our armors, perhaps even something like a ninja suit...just a suggestion.<P>POINT IV-Resistances<BR>Every monk that has gone toe to toe with a caster mob would agree that we are just insects to them, pests that they can easily dispose of.  Even low green casters can do extreme amounts of dmg to us.  Blue casters can just decimate us.  Please look at either adding more resistances to monk armors, or even better, providing the monk with natural resistances.  <P>Well its all i can do for now, please take a look at it.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Getting shredded by casters is a good concern.  Consider a warrior's defense against casters: HP to withstand the nukes and damage shields, higher natural magic resistance, and the ability to stun a caster.  The monk has none of the above.<P>Again, make sure the designers really look into how an off-hand damage bonus will affect the game and how monks view their weapon choice if such a change occurred.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>In response to an earlier post.  It's my choice to be a bare fisted fighter and monks are supposed to be able to fulfill that role in a viable manner from what I've read in the officially sanctioned printed materals available.  If you want to play a primarily weapon wielding class, then don't play a monk.<P>Now to continue.<P>I noticed that today's patch had nothing in it to fix ANY problems or improve the monk comunity in any way.  That's not good.<P>FD needs to be put back the way it was.  As it stands now, after the MoB is lvl 32+ or 34+ or we are in a group, FD is just a skill that give's MoBs free damage on us.  Either put it back or remove it.<P>As for our damage?  Our fists should be comparable to the weapons we have available.  Monk weapons should only be needed to gain different affects.  Like sais would add considerably to the dissarm skill, Nunchaku would add an effect much like alacrity, three sectional staff would give an awesome defense bonus.  Weapons should enhance different skills and abilities, not necessarily damage.<P>Taunt.  I don't want taunt, we shouldn't need taunt.  That's something that should be left to the armor wearing class.<P>If our AC and hit points are to remain around half that of the warrior's, then our damage and defensive abilities should be twice that of the warrior's.<P>Speed and movement bonuses would be a great help too as well as our own damage tables.<P>Gotta go get my daughter from school now.<BR>Malkith</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Monks main weapons should be the fist.  That is what monks are known for now they are apperaing to be weak warriors.  A monks h2h needs to get a better ratio.  A monk lately has been jiped on this patching process and class upgrades, monks need to get better h2h and many other things.  In the way i look at it the h2h is very important as of now.<BR>Have a nice day  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You are paying to play, not create.  Deal with what you get.  I have few problems with my monk.  If you need taunt, get a better group.  It's a group game, and if you're group doesn't know what to expect when certain things are done or not done then teach them.  I can outdamage a warrior and a rogue, though outdamaging rogues are a bit rare, but I've done some calculations to where I have.. me 57 and rogue 59 fyi.  I enjoy FD, and only rarely do I have buggy problems, though they do happen.  Tag a hotkey so that it turns auto-attack off before you FD...helps alot.  I can't count the number of times I've recovered corpses in dungeons like sebilis because a rogue couldn't, all because of FD.  I enjoy FD pulling because for one it's more interesting than sitting there waiting for the warrior to pull, and for two, it eliminates the NEED of an enchanter.  I truly do not understand why Verant does not like FD pulling.  <P>Why are people complaining about weapons and monks.  Before Kunark came out I never even cared about weapons.  Only time I cared about taunting was when I was a young monk in my stupidity not knowing the full potential of every class.  I have a t-staff, KD's and CF.. I use it all.  I even on occassion take off my CF and use my old shivergloves.  I use the effect on my CF as a taunt on it's own if for some odd reason I need it.  It may not be meant to be a taunt, but casting the song on the gloves is a small taunt which I've used on some occasions to get the attention of multiple mobs attacking my groups.  It worked.. imagine that.. a monk with taunting cabability, and no multiple boring posts on the same subject saying we need more taunting ability.  <P>Monks damage output and armor is about the only thing that needs some work, and not even that much work.  Some of you people are amazing in the things you don't know at the level you are.  It's like you're asking to be a warrior, but don't want to waste the time to start a warrior from scratch.  Warriors have taunt, monks have FD, rogues have evade. Which would you prefer to have? I myself prefer FD thank you.  I get hit enough as it is, I don't need anymore taunting ability.  You're life exists at the ability of you AND your group. <P>I agree that it would be to our benefit to know what the vision of the monk is in relation to this game, but until we know that how can we demand anything else and say that Absor or Verant isn't giving us what we're supposedly entitled to? Maybe Verant doesn't have a vision for every class and that's the reason for what unbalancing there is.  Perhaps the question we should be asking is for a vision on all classes because as it stands, the majority of the posts on here are based on the vision of the user, and the user is not the one creating this game.    </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hey, I was thinking, we monks are supposed to be able to deal out alot of damage really fast, right? But if you think about that, it would be kinda hard to keep that up for too long. What I was thinking is why not cut a bunch of delay out of our hand to hand and give us some more nice fast weapons but have our stamina bar go down a bit faster than every ones elses to balance things out. Any ways, it's just an Idea.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Greetings. I've read through most of the postings here, and would like to add a few comments of my own:<P>1) Before all of us really can give Verant meaning, we need to understant not only Verant's vision FOR the monk, but we also need to understand Verant's CURRENT definition of a monk. Without these two blocks of information, all of us will only really be shooting in the dark with our suggestions, and not bringing too much good to the balancing issues. PLEASE, if this is meant to be a discussion, please give us a posting with Verant's current definition of the monk, and the vision of the monk. This is imperative for the monk talk forum, and cannot be dismissed.<P>2)(General for all classes) please alter the consider system. The phrase "you might win" just seems a direct lie when, for instance I'm in Karnor's (I'm a level 52 monk). Just put back the red and yellow colors, or add more levels of consideration. The ones we have now are worth little to us. I was killed by a blue giant in EK the other night. He conned blue to me, yet I was dead long before I'd even scratched his health, and I do not see myself as an inexperienced player<P>3) Why do pets of mages that are lesser in level than myself (Mage 50, for example) always score a perfect quad hit, whilst I have to live with punches for less than 20 in almost every round? Am I less than the pet of a player that is lower than me in level?<P>4) I agree upon all the FD issues.<P>5) I have never used a weapon. In fact, I have free training points for both 1HB and 2HB at the clan house, since I've never used them. Why am I being punished for this? I can accept the fact that a weapon will hurt more than a fist (comparing a fist blow to the nose with that of a steel hammer makes the choise easy), but the fists are part of me, alive. I should at least miss much much less than the weapon wielding brother.<P>6) Minimum damage: Yes. Please. There is no thunder in a kick for 24. At least, remove the "thunderous kick" message if it does less damage than the max damage of a flying kick, because it's not a thunderous kick unless it does more damage than I would do at my best with a normal flying kick<P>7) Offhand = primary hand damage: Yes! Thank you!<P>8) Disarm: Add the ability to knock weapons from offhand too please. We're masters of melee, and we should hate weapons so much that we, as monk only, should be able to disarm completely<P>9) Mend: Something added post 200?<P>Hope this helps )=<P><BR>Patife Kaivalya<BR>52d disciple, Mithaniel Marr<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>Was reflecting on the cleric hate changes and had a thought. Does any self heal including mend count as an aggro gain?  <P>Maybe this is one of the reasons we get aggro so high on a mob? if we are well buffed in hitpoints we are could be upward of 3k+ hps, giving us about 800 aggro points on a full mend.  If this is the case, and hopfully it may not be too late, maybe we should request to absor that he make mend a non-aggro heal?  This might help us reduce aggro a bit.  But only if im right in assuming it does affect hate.<P>Azith</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Patife, I may be too low of level to know much but I think your post was right on.<P><BR>One minor point tho, I know some people that you would wish they hit you w/ a hammer instead of their fist. But these are people that most martial artists will never be equal too. Kinda like a grandmaster ...mmmm. =)<P>I say again, make our hands more deadly. Maybe around 55+ our hands begin to outdamage even the really good weapons. Than at grandmaster level you gain a significant increase in the damage/delay of your hand to hand. I may not know the vision, but that was the vision pre-kunark and i see no reason for it to change.<P><BR>I think being able to play 'round w/ weapons is great, BUT i do not want to feel obligated to do so ...so that I can do the damage output people would expect of me. If wanted that, than i woulda been a rogue or warrior.<P><BR>Sorry to be re-postin' this ...guess I talk w/ Wizards too much (gab, gab, gab  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">)<P><BR>Chuka<BR>Level 13 Monk<P>and...<P>Shenlung Tianzhu<BR>Level 37 Wizard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
