</FONT><HR>Absor, ok I dusted off my shaman and took another look at the "new and improved" Frenzy line. &lt;Sigh&gt;, I think a great majority of the shamans here really appreciate your continued responsiveness to this thread but the statement you just made of:<P>"I don't know if I would call it drastically reduced in usefulness. It still works as it did, except it won't work once the caster is out of mana. Now the way people were using it before (cast down to nearly no mana, then wade in and fight) really won't work anymore. And as it is players haven't found a lot of uses for it in its new form. But that doesn't make it worthless."<P>makes it seem like you don't see how useless this spell line really is now. I would ask how exactly this spell "works as it did", but yet "won't work when the caster is out of mana". What everyone here is trying to say is that the whole _point_ of the spell was that it was to be used "when the caster was out of mana". If it runs out when the caster is out of mana, then it isn't doing what it was supposed to do. But I guess that is where the players and seemingly Verant are differing here. To pretty much all of the posters here the spell line doesn't make sense _unless_ it worked like it did before. I won't rehash the 3 scenarios this spell would be used in, sorry I mean "used less in", because they have been brought up so many times, so much more eloquently by other posters and it's already been stated that this spell line won't remain line it is now thankfully. I'll just add that if you look at the increased stats/affects that the spell gives for a minute tops after draining ALL of your mana, why in the world wouldn't a shaman just use their buff spells which give MUCH higher stats and are MUCH more efficient with mana?<P>No rational person on here would blame you for the time it's going to take for Verant to look into this spell line, find possible fixes, and finally patch it in. From the looks of it, it will probably take a while. However we will keep trying to stress to you how important this is to the shaman community so that you will hopefully convey this sense of urgency to the coding team(s). The sad part of this is that in all the constant gripes from various classes about broken spells and etc, some with basis and many without, I believe this is the first time a WHOLE SPELL LINE has been _utterly_ negated in usefulness and by a unintentional fix. Another fustrating thing is that noone else from Verant has commented on this. "Luckily", this only happened to a spell line marginally used within a class anyway. I can only imagine the uproar if it had been a truly useful spell line for a more widely played class. Anyway, I thank you for the open dialogue and hope it continues.<P>Ourang U'tahn<BR>Dishevelled Hairy Medicine Man of Druzzil Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>For some reason I continue to see my fellow shaman suggesting that the new version of this spell disallow casting, or that it go away when a spell is cast.<P>For the third time. The original spell would allow you to cast after a 30 second delay. That is in fact how it works now.

</FONT><HR>I'm going to go out on a limb here and go through what I think are some fundamental game mechanics involving healers in EQ.<P>Healers get hated by lots of critters in EQ, very quickly.  When the chips are down, the critters will go for someone.  When the healer helps out, the critter typically switches to the healer.<P>When the healer gets mobbed, what happens next?<P>Cleric: Divine Aura to buy time while critters get taunted off or the cleric runs for it.<P>Druid: rather than going crazy with heals, simply evacuate the entire party.<P>Shaman: (pre-nerf) Rage and wade in with the tanks.<P>This spell seems obviously intended as a last-ditch defense spell.  The duration on it exceeds any possible mana total found in EQ, and by quite a margin.  Gordon, I think your observation about the usefulness of the Rage series after the nerf is seriously off base, and I think that the class will be seriously hindered to no good end if the spell series is left as-is.<P>Please consider changing the spell to immediately drain all the shaman's mana and remove the mana per tick component.  I believe this will allow the spell to be used in the capacity that originally seems intended.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, you are just so wrong. Geoff Zatkin designed the Rage line. Geoff Zatkin knew it would continue after mana ran out. Geoff Zatkin did not feel it was a bug.<P>IT WAS NOT A BUG. IT WAS NOT BAD GAME MECHANICS.<P>Look, someone in the live team has retroactively introduced a seemingly interesting concept, and they trashed 5 Shaman spells because of it. Nothing you can say will ever change that.<P>Have you ever actually looked at the Rage mana drain rate? Pop on over and pick up the spell description. You will see, just from a mere glance, that if the spell were to wear out when mana was gone no one would ever cast the spell under any reason.<P>Tell whoever is feeding you this line of bull to give Geoff a call, would you please? Obviously you've got major miscommunication going on.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"Yes, I think you can expect some sort of change."<P>Thank you, that's what we were waiting to hear.<P>"How soon is up to circumstance and timing and all sorts of other things. Hopefully soon."<P>Well, obviously we're all hoping it's sooner rather than later, but I understand that there's a lot going on at the moment. Just keep us in the loop, like you're doing, that's all we ask.<P>"I don't know if I would call it drastically reduced in usefulness. It still works as it did, except it won't work once the caster is out of mana."<P>It's hard to argue against this without making the kind of "Verant knows nothing about &lt;insert class here&gt;" accusations that I prefer to avoid. All I can say is that it was a marginally useful spell before, used by those shamans who preferred to risk fighting rather than fleeing when a fight wasn't going there way. I don't feel that it was at all unbalancing in its previous form, and neither, it would seem, did Verant. In fact I haven't used it myself in around 20 levels. But it was very useful in getting past that difficult hump for shamans, around the teen levels.<P>"Now the way people were using it before (cast down to nearly no mana, then wade in and fight) really won't work anymore. And as it is players haven't found a lot of uses for it in its new form. But that doesn't make it worthless.<BR>Less effective, and not useful in the way it was before, absolutely."<P>I think it's worth pointing out that I still used to die after casting it. It didn't guarantee success, and a more cautious player would have rooted and run instead of using this line. But some of us like to tank a little, even though we're not very good at it.<P>I'm going to try it in it's new form later today, and see what happens. I'll try to do so near a zone, because I'm pretty sure it'll all end in tears, but I feel I have to know what I'm complaining about. I have experience of the spell line pre-change, but not post. However I do clearly recall that I used to be at zero mana very quickly - I have a high bind wounds skill because if I survived after using Rage, I'd do so at very low health, and obviously had no way of healing.<P>Please, if you can, try it for yourself if you haven't already done so. And if you have tried it, please tell us what you thought so we can understand why you think it's still useful when we're claiming it isn't. We need to understand what you think the spell line's usefulness is.<P>Thanks again for staying with us in this discussion,<P>Adran Windrunner, barbarian shaman of 43 winters<BR>Sundered Heart, Erollisi Marr server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just popping over to bump the thread and to let absor in on a little secret.<P>Shamans are EQ's hyrbid caster class. Necros DOT's, mages summon/pet line, enchanters speed/slow line, druids sow, wizards nukes, and clerics heals.<P>This does not make us as powerful as it sounds, all these abilities are much less powerful than the parent classes, like rangers and druids.<P>But this also means that we get more nerfs than all other classes. examples...<P>Druids dot nerf... i dont have snare, but my dot's were cut by 33%. <P>Enchanters pet/invis nerf. I cant charm sand giants and leave them invisible in oasis to kill newbies, but i cant cast invis on my pet anymore. (my green pet attracts green mobs)<P>Scale of wolf nerf. Again, i dont have snare. But now a traveling spell designed for me (no teleports) poofs when i am attacked or have a spell cast at me.<P>And now it looks like i have to share a nerf with paladins too? I guess the reason that we are upset about it is that yer stripping our spell line (and some are very high level) to give paladins an ability that they never had, never asked for and likely will never use.<P>Shamans get the shaft all too often in many different ways with little to no enhancements to show for all the nerfs. There is a whole can of worms i wont open regarding how all other classes post-kunark progressed while shamans floundered in a backwater eddy. After seeing the velious spells we know this wont change.<P>ye gods man, dont go drilling holes in a sinking ship. Too many shamans have left already, we dont need more to go. Take a look around the servers one night and see how few shamans there are cruising around. Most people who pick shaman do not make it to 25 before quitting.<P>Those who do, persevere because that they enjoy helping others. Being a support class sucks, ask any cleric. Dont make it worse.<P>Elof Valantor, 56th Luminary of Quellious<P>P.S. i've played on pvp servers also.

</FONT><HR>Absor, you say the spell is still useful, but just can't be used when the caster was very low on mana. Unfortunately, the ONLY time this spell was of any use at all was when we were very low on mana. Meleeing just isn't more effective than casting for a shaman at any time. If we cast a Rage spell, it was because we were very low on mana and needed it just to survive. So the spell is indeed completely useless now, not just less useful.<BR>Personally, I would like to see the line completely revamped as a targetable melee buff with a regen component that stacks with other regens as well as strength and stamina buffs that stack with other spells. <BR>Either this or make it a lesser version of Torpor. Being as no one at Verant plays a high level shaman, I'll explain what Torpor is. Torpor is a 1200 hp regen type heal that lasts for 24 seconds. It also slows attack speed and snares the target for those 24 seconds. How about a 44 or 49 Torpor style spell that heals 800 hp for 130 mana and lasts 30 seconds, with the same snare and slowdown effect. Also add weaker versions of this at 34, 24 and 14 maybe to complete the line.<P>Jing<BR>56 Luminary of Drinal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I have not used the rage spell line in so long I almost forgot about it untill I saw this posting  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> . <P>Alen ? the spell at 20th lvl was great it sometimes saved my life, most of the time I died cause it was a cool spell to have, and IF I was lucky and happen to kill it before it killed me it was great to pertend I was a fighter, no way I could out damage a fighter or to hit as often but it was a life save at times. Now its effect is usless cause if I am oom I am going to be medding not fighting with me being the only healer, and with my fighting skill caps as low as they are. At lease with the spell I could fight back or I could fight with the tanks once I was out of mana If there was a cleric in the party. <P>Now I can see IF the new spells the Paladins are getting have a mana drain and C2 on it may not drain there mana as fast so you would have to code it so if the drain reached 0 the spell would be done with I am sure at the mana drain is not that bad for the paladins or it would be usless for them to cast now that they get Great Heal the mana drain spells would not go good with there class maybe for for the Shadow Knights the mana drain spells would be great for them. <P>Another thing aswell not to far off the subject the best way for shaman to heal is to cast regen but If you are doted you can cast the regen and losse the mana AND the spell does not land can you fix this or look in too it thanks ....<P>Now the spells maybe better IF the spell does no not have a mana drain but wont let you cast any spells untell you cansel the spell effect or it fades. <P>Or we could just make up a NEW line of spells  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ... A low level Haste would be cool, well we do get the heste line or even a Mez line would be cool or even a better mana regen spells well better then Cannibalize for I hate the sound the spell makes very time I hit that button!!! <P>Or maybe even something new all together? make these are double buffing spells Str/Stam Agi/Dex line of spells or a group line WE are the buff Master why wait untill 57-59 level to get Group buff spells that are weeker then are single buffs when the Druid gets pack Chloroplast when we get Chloroplast a level be for they even see Chloroplast? (Is this to make them more group friendly?)<P>Or how about more Innerfire line of spells? Or maybe a damage shield line of spells? or or or....  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>To many to choose from just stay with the Rage line of spells and fix it so that you keep lossing mana because we are getting mana back even if you are not medding and even if you are Cannibalizing you are not making mana with the spell up.<P>Maulsan 52nd lvl Troll Shaman<BR>ps a damage shield would be alsome  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

That would bump it up into usefull spells for me.

</FONT><HR>I don't get the point of this nerf.<P>All spells are "powered by no mana" once the mana is expended at the time of casting. If I cast Talisman of Kragg it uses the mana and then the buff stays active for it's duration until it wears off, gets dispelled, or I die.<P>Is there some reason why the Rage line can't act the same way? Cast it, it consumes mana, then prevents mana regeneration until the user clicks it off, dispells it, or it wears out.<P>As an example:<P>Voice of the Berserker, L59<P>Self Only<BR>Mana: To be decided (50? it DOES prevent mana regen)<BR>+74-75 to Strength<BR>+28-29 to AC<BR>+34-35 HP regeneration<P>Voice of the Berserker consumes the mana required at the time of casting. It then bestows the effects upon the target; +75 max str, +29 max AC, +35 hp/tick regen. It also prevents any mana regeneration until it wears off, gets dispelled, or the target dies. Manasong, Clarity, Meditation, Natural regeneration of mana(standing), and Cannibilize as well as items (manastone, modulating rods) will not provide extra mana. Additionally, you will not be able to cast other spells while this is in effect. But it would leave existing mana alone. Eg, If I have 2000 mana before I cast this spell, it uses 50 mana, leaving me with 1750. However, I can not regenerate back any more mana  above  1950 and I can not cast any spells to use  the 1950 mana until this spell is no longer in effect.  This is why I recommend a low mana  usage, there are many drawbacks.  <P>Tugg Twotimah<BR>L59 Ogre Luminary, Prexus<BR>Keepers of the Faith<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Someone asked earlier if the Cripple line did anything. I have to ask the same thing of Incapaciate and earlier. All they seem to do is cheese off the MOB.<P>As far as this discussion. I rarely used this Rage line of spell through to 52. I hope it is fixed but am concerned that the user community will be so focused on this near trivial issue that we will lose sight of the fact that .. post 50 .. the Shaman is a marginalized class and is now doomed to be the "filler" slots in groups since we can't bring anything unique and necessary to the mix. Unless something is done to fix these problems I just can't justify wasting my time and money playing a game that I am losing interest in due to shoddy design, implementation, testing and above all "customer service" that VI is imposing on us.<P>Cheers <BR>Ouchless Bandayde 52 Mystic - Erollisi Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I play a shaman, and I really enjoy being able to melee when I get the chance, therefore I am a big fan of this line of spells.  Absor asked for our help in determining how to make this spell work again.  Here is my idea.  There already exist numerous spells with fixed durations.  When you cast that spell, it lasts an exact amount of time and it always lasts that amount of time.  Make the Rage line have a fixed duration.  For example purposes, lets just say five minutes.  During these five minutes all the spell gems will stay gray and you will be unable to regen mana, like before.  If the technology does not currently exist to let you drain all a characters mana for a fixed duration spell, don't drain all their mana.  These spells are not used by every shaman and I can't think of them ever being abused by any shaman.  If you have some mana left after the spell ends I don't think that is too unbalancing or unfair becuase you still can't use it while Rage is on. I think this is trade off enough because a shaman can hurt somebody a lot more with their mana than they can with their spear or their hammer, but it allows those shaman who like a little melee from timt to time to step in and enjoy themselves.  This just a suggestion and I hope it will get all you other shamen thinking on a good way to repair a line of spells that I think really gives a lot of character to the shaman class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Yes, I do remember Arkand DID have a conversation with GZ about this on the Crucible long ago.)<P>--<P>C. Repost of previous plus new ideas:<P>My goal here is that the new spell should be as useful as the old one *IN IT'S ORIGINAL CAPACITY*. <P>That is to say:<BR>* emergency type situation<BR>* caster is low mana ("1/2 bub left")<BR>* effects are the same (buffs + duration)<BR>* occasional use (used to have to med to full after casting) <P>So, can you do this, Verant? <P># 1. NO MANA REGEN. This is a biggie, as it prevents a lot of exploits. Meditation, Clarity, all those are effectively "off" for the duration.<P># 2. DRAIN ALL REMAINING MANA. Either this or #1 is required for balance I think.  Both would be fine. <P># 3. VERY SMALL MANA DRAIN. It must be small to allow someone who is low mana on mana to cast this spell and keep it active for a reasonable period of time. I mean like 1-2 points per tick for the level 19 (rank 5?) spell. Tricky to get this right.<P># 4. LONG RECAST DELAY. Simulates medding to full before using again. Because as shaman increase in levels, we get slightly better at regenerating mana, and the chance that some one nice has cast Clarity, Breeze, etc. on us increases,  the recast delay should be less as the spell rank increases.  For example: Frenzy (Rank 5) recast delay 2 1/2 min.  Fury (Rank 8) rd = 2 min. Rage (Rank 11) rd = 1 3/4 min.  Voice of Berzerker (Rank 21-level59) rd = 1 1/2 min.<P># 5. NO SPELL CASTING WHILE ACTIVE and/or SPELL CASTING CANCELS EFFECT. Simulates having no mana for the duration. <P>Let me explain my test case. Some of you shaman are asking for Torpor type spells at 34 as a replacement (or a better pet at 55). I think you've all forgotten how evil the hump is for shaman 19-24. That's when I used this spell the most. I needed anything I could get. <P>TEST CASE: <BR>Level 19 shaman<BR>Normal (&lt;100 Wis) mana pool<BR>1/2 bub of mana left <P>She casts Frenzy and what happens? It should be roughly the same as before the "fix". I'm especially worried about duration here. <P>According to the Casters Realm site, this shaman above has about 361 points of mana at full.  At 1/2 bub, she has 36.  The casting cost for Frenzy is about 25, plus mana drain.  36 - 25 = 11 points of mana.  At even 1 point of net mana drain per tick, this spell won't last more than 66 seconds, which I think most shaman would be unhappy with.  (I'd be mad as heck actually.)  The spell needs to actually run AT LEAST 2 - 3 min, and closer to its original duration would be much better.<P>The way to do this, as I see it, is to use #1 (no mana regen) and/or #2 (drain mana pool) above, and leave off #3 (the man drain per tick) entirely. Adding in #4 and #5 along with #1 and #2 bring the spell close to it's original intent without nerfing too much.<P>Thanks for consdering this,<BR>NCD<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan:<P>The mage pet proc'ing and the rage series changes are generally unjustifiable.   Instead of fixing the whole thing, you guys FIRST introduce the nerf and then MUCH MUCH later fix the whole thing.<P>It is a pattern and it stinks.  Rogue poisons were handled precisely the same way--first they were made them have a "casting time" (mid-January 2000 if I recall the precise time frame) and then 3 or 4 months later (April?  May?) you added the new poison-making capabilities.  In addition, stupid stupid things like interrupting poisoning has yet to be fixed or addressed as far as I know.<P>It's frustrating for you guys to defend clear nerfs without providing the whole solution.  It's dumb to infuriate your customer base at a whim.<P>What more do you really need to know from us than my last paragraph???</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor:<P>I am glad to hear you say that the spell line was working as intended prior to the change recently made.  I am a bit confused how you intend to make the spell work as intended, i.e. as it was before, without making it work exactly as it was before.  I am hoping you are saying that you plan to have the spell returned to it's exact same effect, using a different mechanism.  Are you asking us to offer up mechanisms that would meet this objective?<P>My perception of how the spell used to work was that it's ongoing mana cost was paid by sucking up any mana we regenerated while the effect is active.  That doesn't sound like the spell is using mana that doesn't exist, but rather that it is using all the mana that is regenerated.<P>  How about calculating the mana being regenerated in a tick, and applying that mana cost to the spells usage for that tick?  <BR>  How about graying out our spell gems while the effect is active?  <P>Without knowing more specificly how the spell mechanics work, we as players aren't really going to be able to offer up much more creative resolutions.<P>If I am misunderstanding you, and you intend to have the spell changed to another effect, because you don't want to specially reimplement the spell to it's original effect, please let us know now. <P> Some of us really do use this line.  Not everyday, but it has saved my tail more than a time or two.<P>Dagor Twiceborn<BR>In Service of the Tribunal<BR>Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"Yes, I think you can expect some sort of change. How soon is up to circumstance and timing and all sorts of other things. Hopefully soon. I don't know if I would call it drastically reduced in usefulness. It still works as it did, except it won't work once the caster is out of mana. Now the way people were using it before (cast down to nearly no mana, then wade in and fight) really won't work anymore. And as it is players haven't found a lot of uses for it in its new form. But that doesn't make it worthless.<P>Less effective, and not useful in the way it was before, absolutely."<P><BR>Please stop posting this highly spun garbage...<P>Unless you have something of substance to say then dont post anything at all.  This kind of message from Verant boils my blood.  It's like you are debating a topic and just trying your hardest to prove you are right just to be the devils advocate.  I cannot believe you post this kinda garbage.<P>How in the world is this spell not worthless now?  Please tell me and the rest of the Shaman community when you would use this spell now?  Keep in mind if there are clearly more effective ways to accomplish the same thing then you havent given a valuable use.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>     Absor, many of the Shaman community noticed this afternoon that Rage has now been altered (again).  I personally am very impressed with the fast response on Verant's part, but I had a few questions regarding the change.  <BR>1.  Has the entire line been changed (from Frenzy to VoB), or merely Rage at this point?  <BR>2.  Most Shaman seem very happy with the change, with the exception of the removal of the regen component.  Would it be possible to add some sort of regeneration back into the spell (perhaps at the cost of one of the stat bonuses)?<BR>3.  Is this merely a trail of a new version of Rage, and we can expect it to be altered again, or is version set in stone?<BR>     Thank you for your time, and for responding to the concerns of the Shaman community so quickly.  Also, not to keep harping on it, but has anyone considered the duel wield possibility our 55 pet (I know, I know, kvetch, kvetch, kvetch)?<P>                        Thantu Frostwalker<BR>                  http://www.shamanscrucible.com</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034888-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034888.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034888-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034888-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034888-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=034888&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=034888&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
