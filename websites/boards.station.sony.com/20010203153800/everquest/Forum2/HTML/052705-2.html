</FONT><HR>Ok.  I THINK I have managed to make it through all the posts.  The one thing that I see missing that really annoys me is regents (i.e. peridots).<P>Clerics get a spell at 58 called Mark of Naltron, which uses 1 peridot to buff their entire group.  So, at level 58, their expenses are cut to 1/6th.<P>Enchanters use peridots as well.  Many times, I have to Rune my entire group.  In order to do so, I have to use 6 peridots.  I will have to do that all through my levels.  Is it not possible to cut our expenses the same as you did clerics?  Give us a 58th level spell that is group Rune?  I don't think this would cause us to be any more overpowered.  And it would save us some money, money that I have difficulty replacing on raids.<P>-Shelaria Rivermist<BR>51 Enchanter<BR>Tunare Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A few things I haven't seen brought up much in the last thread (I've managed to keep up with about 75% of the posts).<P>*Reducing Tedium*<BR>Two basic ways to reduce tedium:<BR>-Increase duration of our most common buffs (clarity, haste, magic resist) and increase mana cost accordingly.<BR>-Make more of our spells available in group versions.  I'd second the moving of group clarity to a lower level to allow it more use, but why not group augmentation, group invis/see invis, group gift? These don't have to be more mana efficient, just allow us to reduce our time spent mindlessly selecting group member1, cast, group member2, cast.. ect.  These are downtime / travel spells, I'd rather be spending my downtime chatting with group mates or talking about how we're going to take the next mob, not buffing.<P>Do group spells or longer durations have balance implications?  We're casting these spells anyway, why not give us an easier means to do so.  Set the mana cost so the only benefit is reducing tedium and mindless repetition.  <P>I think too often Verant offers the removal of an annoyance (group buffing, longer buff durations, meditating without spell books <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> as the reward for leveling, rather than a positive reward.  <P>The next suggestion definitely has balance implications so I'm not holding my breath, but what the hell.<P>*Charm Casting Time*<BR>A while back the casting times and recast times of the higher level mesmerize spells underwent a reduction to encourage their use, since enchanters as a whole were sticking with lower level spells exclusively.  I wonder if a re-evaluation of the higher level charm spells would also be possible.  Charm and Beguile are great, but Cajoling Whispers and Allure have a casting time just long enough to discourage their use (5.5 and 6 seconds respectively). Things get better again with our lvl 53 charm at 4 seconds.  <P>These have very little implication on an intial charm, but faster casting times make re-charming possible in conjunction with our stuns (albeit difficult).  Again this is wishlist area, but I don't understand why the increase in diffulculty for 39-53, and then remove it again.  Also I'd gladly give up dictate for a general purpose charm spell that affects 53+ but I suspect I'm in the minority on that.<P>Last topic is a repeat but I thought I'd second it.<P>*Targeting*<BR>Targeting is difficult due to many reasons: mobs stack, frame rate slow downs, lag spikes, and most annoying - mobs who's bounding boxes seem to extend far beyond what is visible.  I'll second two suggestions I've seen earlier in the thread as ways to help.<BR>- Cycle nearest target - pressing the button multiple times cycles from nearest to furthest and back again, within a set radius.<BR>- Anti-assist - works as above but excludes what your main tank (or whatever) has targeted.<P>That's all I have at the moment.  In closing let me say I think overall Verant has done a great job with enchanters and I love playing them. Great work.<P>-Finias<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>All good enchanters know how to keep track of who needs buffs and when, what you do is cast the buff on yourself first, as<BR>                                                   soon as you see it fading it will be fading on others as well in a matter of seconds.<P>                                                   Good luck in the fight friend.<P>                                                   Nirran Perfection<BR>                                                   Lvl 38 Chanter - Tunare<P>no worries about offending my friend I see your point and while casting clarity on my party I can see when it runs out because it's a spell I would use on myself. However Alacrity and Augmentation are not spells I would cast on myself, because they are mana intensive and the mana I used to cast it on myself could have been used for something elses like mezzes or debuffs or even the ocasional nuke. If you've ever had to buff 4 tanks you know you don't have that much mana left and you would like to keep what you have for emergencys.<P><BR>"Imagine if you would the amount of spam you would get after casting clarity or celerity on a newbie zone or for a Druid<BR>                                                   that casts SoW. You would get a note on every persons buff droping.

It makes it much easier when they do.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>/em cheer Ramon  <P>Thanks for summing up the thoughts I was having on Absor's post.  How utterly ridiculous.  Alan may have just waved the nerf stick in our face, I don't know.<P>I personally cant understand even saying a statement like that.  It does nothing but enflame us, or at least makes me mad.<P>Maybe all us enchanters writing extremely long posts are just a bunch of whiners but so far I have seen extremely well thought out posts.<P>In Alan's early response he failed miserably to recognize the strength debuffing components of our weaken line and the further subtractive component to strength of our dots.  Personally I would really like those fixed in some manner.<P>I hate to say it but it appears that whomever holds this post of pr guy or whatever you want to call them always ends up saying something utterly ridiculous.  No offense intended Absor... I am aware you are human and make mistakes too  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I simply wish that for all these thread talks would yield one result.  Absor compiles all the stuff and takes it to the dev team.  Absor DOES NOT offer us opinion or say he is or is not adding it to the list.  My personal view is that it should all be on the list.  Every time I see something like him adding his personal views or what he will put on the list or not I cringe.  Are you our representative or not sir?  You are one man deciding the fate of thousands of players.  I would prefer you say .. ok thanks guys I got all the requests... time to hand it over to the dev team and let them decide.  I really think that is much better than you debating with an entire group of people that run the class on a regular basis.  You are one man and you admittedly don't have a clue about enchanters.  Please do not take this as a critisism on you.  I just ask that you think about it before condemning things that we as a class fully appreciate and understand.  I do also want to thank you very very much for these threads on class talk because it has been a genuine pleasure seeing all the class communities come together and try and make for a better game.  You were right on in doing this Absor.  <P>Good day.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Enchanters are a blast to play, a lot of our spells are messed up tho.  We have most useless lines in our spells than I care to think of.  What is surprizing is that enchanters still manage to do there jobs and have great impact.<P>Before we hit Velious...  after that were buff-o-matic 2000's, cause we can't touch the mobs.  As a 57th lvl chanter why my guild raids there in any area that a 57th lvl chanter would actually be, I'm basically a right click item.  C2/speed, its sad, I don't even keep my stuns loaded after 30 mins in PoG, cause all the mobs after that are imune to it.  With all our spells being magic based were just around for the ride.  Shamans do slow, I tried to slow a mob in PoG once...  died right after and I had *4* clerics on me!!  And was resisted to boot.<P>I liked having the *option* to charm as a matter of CC... now we have to use lvl 60 charm on lots of stuff to take it out of the picture for *50* seconds..  we try to pull stuff off to the side to root park it.. you have any idea how lame it is for a 57th lvl chanter to be root parking mobs?  Or how much damage we take trying to root park a 56th lvl mob?  I do my group better by *not* trying..  I have a spam msg setup now.. "right click me for C2/Speed" when I'm in PoG cause thats all I'm good for.  And thats not the only zones that Enchanters, somebody that has done CC for *55* levels, is turned into this right click item.<P>Aside from that, some of the spells just don't make sense.  Umbra is *pointless*, Gift was a *good idea* .. but does *far* to little for the mana.  I agree that GoB should do more mana.. more mana regen.  Druids (no, don't nerf druids) get a level 60 spell that makes ours look like a joke.  We have more page 50 spells than most other clases as well.<P>I won't even *start* on how much of a joke our PoG robe is...  what moron thought that enchanters would like a 30 sec right click rune *4* that still takes a peridot would be helping is beyond me.  You can't *abort* that spell... I watched helplessly as people died as the time for those spells to cast was done.<P>Whats sad is I truly think in the end of this 'class balancing' were just going to get nerfed in the old world/kunark and even more helpless in Vel  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">  I know of 15+ high level enchanters that *quit* due to the insame high magic resists of Vel mobs at this point.<P>Songwind k'Treva<BR>57th lvl Enchanter<BR>Club Fu - Bristlebane<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My enchanter is now level 53.  I HAVE read the above posts and think they are all very valid.  There is one thing that is not posted yet and that is....<BR>I have used pets since day one.  At level 53, I have dumped 3/4 of my mana trying to summon a pet due to fizzles.  I can not explain how frustrating that is.  I would have to think the 55 pet will cost me 2-3 full mana loads to get off if I am fizzling this much on a 49 spell.<BR>The other thing is, in Velious, I have started playing mister Wizard (I am nuking).  The recast times on our spells are insane!!<BR>If I am to be useless in crowd control in Velious, can I at least try to support the group by dealing a little damage?  I don't think the 528 I am currently doing (when not resisted by blues) is going to drastically change the balance if the recast time were dropped by 2-4 seconds.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>At level 51, Theft of Thought is quite the uber spell, allowing me to remain fm virtually at will. I also realize that this spell will be needed at higher level to compensate for the insane costs of mezzes.<P>Gift of magic lines of spells improve the mana base for a person. What I'm thinking is a change that will allow the enchanter to transfer mana to other people.<P>With the spells that I have memmed, I do crowd control and buffs, never nuke.. so I actually keep my mana rather high as it is  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

It seems to me that the spells I need don't drop from the level of mob that I can fight.  And I don't want to camp for spells.  Spells from merchants cost, what, maybe 25pp?  You can bet I'll be paying much more than that for Fascination or Wind of Tishani.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>Jolla<BR>52 Enchanter<BR>E'Ci</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi Absor, and the rest of Verant Interactive.<P>First of all, I'd like to say that most of us Enchanters must be quite glad that you've created this discussion, so that we have an almost sure-fire way of being heard about our ideas and discontentments.<P>Now to my idea... I've read many posts on mezzing the currently un-mezzable mobs, charming the currently uncharmable mobs, and all that good stuff. I agree that there should be some way we could control even those, at a penalty.<P>There would be a charm/mez/stun/whatchahave that CAN mez/stun/charm/whatchahave giants, for example, but the Enchanter would be completely unable to cast spells (or maybe even move?) during the duration of the spell.<P>An example is...<P>Raid Leader (RL): buffs all up? ready, set... PULL THE UBERSOANDSOWHATEVERTHINGIE!!!<P>*Monk/tank/whatever runs out...<P>Monk/tank/whatever: WHOOPS!!! His guardians came as well.<P>Enchanter1&2: No problem; we'll take care of them!<P>Enchanter1 begins to cast a spell.<BR>Enchanter2 begins to cast a spell.<P>Guardianmob1 has been mesmerized.<P>Enchanter1 is absorbed in concentration in overwhelming the monster's psyche, and is therefore unable to provide any further assistance until the connection is broken.<P>Guardianmob2 has been charmed by Enchanter2.<P>Enchanter2 is absorbed in concentration in overwhelming the monster's psyche, and is therefore unable to provide any further assistance until the connection is broken.<P>End Scenario<P>In this case, we see that the Enchanter is actually DOING something; and when he is charming/mezzing, he STILL has to be ever-vigilant to make sure that when the mez/charm breaks, he will be sought after.<P>The 0-casting for the duration of the charm/mez is a significant penalty, and very in-tune with gameplay and a realizable phenomenon, as well. Maybe the Enchanter could even be forced to move at a walk speed for the duration of the spell?<P>I think this solution would work very well because in the midst of an epic fight like that, Enchanters (like my other colleagues have said) don't do much except cast Clarity, and speed. By this high a level, both spells last a while, and Enchanters are left with nothing to do, practically. Thus, my solution would not only give the Enchanter something to do, but also compensate for the immense CC'ing power very well.<P>Well, that's my two copper.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The greatest Illusion enchanters comes at level 50. This is the GOD illusion. Other classes think enchanters are a GOD class because they see all the rolls go the right way and enchanters control an impossible pull. When one or two things go wrong, the 50+ enchanter then uses Illusion corpse well not an actual illusion  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Enchanter is a pretty ballanced class. <P>They only speed up or delay things for the most part. They are not in the damage buisness, or the healing business.<P>Thier main issues are Velious, and broken spells.<P>Please address the str debuff, and the str and other debuff spells. They currently have absolutly no effect on mobs damage or movement. Maybe make it a %Str reduction, or a %hit reduction. This would meen a creature hitting for 120 might only quad hit for 100 or 90.  Many classes have this, so it would not create class ballance.<P>Whirl till hurl has uses, but the upgrade (Dyn's Dizzying Draught) does not.<P>Give the enchanter some reason to go to velious. <P>Note to other enchanters, drop the werewolf flute thing, almost all enchanter forms are now available to other classes, mismore even has a werewolf item for multiple classes. Elemental forms of earth and water are now available to others, wolf, skelly, tree, ect are others, the enchanter class has been diluted.<P>Level 51 enraged wolf Illusion:<BR>Illusion spirit wolf<BR>Jboot speed increase<BR>Attack +20<P>Just a reminder, breaze is 16th level, sow is 14 or 9. High level druids get mana regen, Shamens get mana regen at much lower level. Speed increase in spirit wolf form is self only.<P>52nd Illusion corpse:<BR>Cast time 10 sec.<BR>recast time 1 min<BR>This would not hurt other class ability due to extreme cast time and recast time.<P>Velious suggestions:<BR>Lower the agro on tash line. Currently tash will agro the creature more than a warrior can taunt. Using tash on velious creatures is the only way to get a chance of any enchanter spell from hitting.<P>52nd or 53rd level pet charm spell. <BR>Replace Wake of Tranquility (currently uselss)<BR>Target: (pet only)<BR>Min durration 1 sec- max durration 5 min.<BR>Wipe hate list (after pet breaks charm)<BR>This is a way for the enchanter to engage thier pet on an mob. The pet is then used as a dot on the high mr mobs. <P>52nd or 53rd level pet attack spell. <BR>Target: mob<BR>Effect spell casted on mob causes mob to cast an 1point damage spell on the enchanter, thus engaging the pet if the pet is not already agroed on something else. This allows the frail enchanter to give up one spell slot in order to a minicule amount of damage on high MR mobs.<P>Overall Enchanters are ballanced, the take the brunt of any mistakes made, and die the easiest of any class. They agro faster than a cleric CHeal but don't have the armor to back them up. They have weak and highly resistable damage spells, but have great CC spells to offset. <P>One last note, if a giant class creature is trying to be messed, it has a flag similar to undead check, level check, and animal check. It should be easily coded to give a message before the spell is cast to say "you cannot cast this spell on this creature." This would be great in velious where the giant flag has been given to all sorts of non giants.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>With regards to the Dazzle spell at lvl 59, I'd like to talk about the re-cast. Its been so long since I've used any of the other long lasting mes spells i.e. enthral,etc. But remember them all being the same with some sort of delayed re-cast. I believe its around 3-4 seconds. With other classes having instand re-cast on their innate spells i.e. heal for clerics and nuke for mages I believe the innate ability of a enchanter should have instant re-cast. I know mes's are powerfull as they are, however the re-cast is a bit much I think.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Change to charm - allow the use of /pet get lost to break charm AND have a chance of mem blurring the pet based on its health at the time of the command.  IE - the pet is at 50% health and you pet get lost it has 1/2 of remembering that you charmed it.  90% there is a 10% chance it will remember you.  <P>Of course mobs that are within agro of you and normally hate you will act as normal afterward.  This will add a bit of gambling as to whether you should immediately kill the charmed mob or as to let him heal up and then break charm so that it won't go agro on the enchanter(or any other class that can charm).  Worried about enchanters doing the "/pet guard here" and moving away to /pet get lost?

</FONT><HR>1)Illusion and religion?<BR>I think the development group needs to decide how<BR>relgious factions are identified before working on this.  Race faction is obvious, its pysical appearance. Group factions may be considered 'reputation' ie hey bob is cool he killed 800 orc.<BR>But how does an NPC know your religion?

That is fine and dandy, except I get a better conversion rate if I get regen instead, and then use call of bones for a HP to mana conversion. The problem is, the only way to remove clarity is to go through and have someone cancel magic on me, thus effectively cleaning off all the buffs that I just paid someone to give me. <BR>My request is twofold, as enchanters are probably not going to stop thinking they are the gods gift to mana for casters. <BR>1. make clarity right click removable, for those of us that dont want it.<BR>2. Make it so that the Call of Bones line overwrites clarity. As it stands now, Clarity overwrites CoB. Thus, I cannot cast one of my own spells on myself, and that is very frustrating.<P>I can understand why you would not want clarity and CoB to stack as it would provide an absolutely horrendous amount of mana in a short time, but the fact that I cannot use my own spells at any point in the battle that I want is kind of ludicrous.<P>Talisson BoneDancer<BR>37th circle of Gnome Gnecromancy<BR>Dark Magi of the Shadow Striders<BR>Tunare<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have been playing an Enchantress since April of 1999, so I remember playing when we were THE most undesired class under 29th. Even then I was happy to play an Enchantress because I thought the rewards would be worth the suffering. I was correct.<P>I can't say I really have any complaints about playing an Enchantress pre-50. It is certainly a tough road, but a rewarding one. You play a class which takes itelligence and skill. There are certainly ways to make it easier, but the same could be said of any class.<P>I think a lot of the previous posts have made good points for improvement, so I won't go into them with the exception of saying that look carefully at some of the longer posts. There are a lot of good suggestions to be found for balancing.<P>Post-50 has seen a blurring of the lines between classes. This started with RoK and has continued in SoV. In my opinion, the important thing about playing a class is it's uniqueness. Every one of us started a class because something for that class jumped out at us. "Wizards are the masters of big damage," "Magicians can summon anything under the sun," "Druids are one with nature." Along with these perceptions, correct or not, comes certain expectations for abilities, some of which were stated in the manual.<P>I know I have been rambling but please stick with me for a few more minutes. In my mind, what the post-50 world comes down to is 2 things:<P>1) Raids<BR>2) Class-defining abilities<P>Raid complaints/suggestions have been beat to death. For class-defining abilities the case is less clear. We have reached the highest levels possible (unless another level expansion comes out). We deserve to hold the abilities implied by that power and our class.<P>Each class has certain abilities which they consider class-defining:<P>Magicians have pets, summoning, and damage shields.<BR>Druids have teleportation, snare, and SoW<P>Each class has their own opinions. Enchanters have always had a wide variety of abilities which we do well.<P>We caster-buff, we melee-buff, we debuff, we have illusions/faction adjusters, we enchant things, we mez and we charm.<P>In my mind this is too many class defining abilities. Some say we have already given up melee-buffs to Shamans, and I would agree with the major exception of Haste. I would also argue that debuffs, again with a major exception of Slow, are almost useless in PvE. However, Shaman's have claimed slow as one of their class-defining abilities, which is fine with me.<P>That still leaves way too many abilities for us too handle. I think part of the problem is that the initial Vision(tm) of Enchanters enchanting weapons and the like was considered too powerful in the pre-50 arena. I think Verant needs to choose 2-3 of the above mention and make them class defining. In doing so, improve those spell which are class defining as to make them outstrip other classes ability to do them. Nerf the others if necessary to achieve balance.<P>The most likely of the abilities is caster-buffs: C2, Brilliance, Insight, Enlightenment, and the Gift series are considered some of the best buffs in the game. I certainly would want to lose them. If this is class defining, then make the high lvl versions better. Currently Necro's regen mana faster than c2, this should not be allowed if c2 is class defining. Make a lvl 60 buff similar to Aeogilsm in it's effects. C2, Enlighten and Gift of Insight all in one package which lasts 2 hours. Or make a c3 at lvl 60, something to show that Enchanters reall are the best at this.<P>This post is getting too long so I will shorten the rest into bullets.<P>If mez is class defining then:<BR>- Either decrease mana cost of post-50 mezzes or make them neigh-unresistable<BR>- Remove the unmezzable flag from mobs except gods/dragons and giants<BR>- Do not let bards/necro mez any of the above<P>If charm is class defining then:<BR>- Put a minimum duration on charms starting at lvl 34 or so<BR>- Fix Dictate. This is a lvl 60 class defining spell, it should last longer than 48 seconds and should recharge in less than 5 minutes.<BR>- Add a charm spell between 53 and 60 which allows us to charm mobs up to 56th lvl or so.<BR>- Remove the anit-charm flag from mobs except from gods, dragons and special cases.<P>I think we can safely say that enchanting things is not class defining for us<P>If illusions/factions are class defining then listen to some of the suggestions for new illusions made in this post. For a class defining ability to have no spells post-44th lvl is kinda sad.<P>If Debuffs are class defining then:<BR>- make them useful in PvE. There have already been some suggestions for how to do this such as percentages and the like.<P>All classes deserve to have 1 or more things which make them unique. Just to be clear, I do not expect or want all of the above. I think 2-3 of the above abilities needs to be selected as defining and Enchanter and that my suggestions for those should be considered. <P>Thank you for listening Absor.<P>-Dana<BR>58th Enchantress<BR>Rallos Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have a level 34 Enchanter on Veeshan and agree with the problem that enchanters are, simply put, delicate.  I have a simple proposal for a new spell that might be useful.<P>Mirror Image:  A spell that would allow an enchanter to make duplicate illusions of himself to avoid being hit.  Say a high mana cost spell with a 3-5 minute duration (enough for one battle) that would simply make monsters miss him occasionally.  Let's say 33% of incoming hits miss, that would give the cleric just that small extra moment of time to slap a heal on the enchanter.  Anyway, this spell could be a scaleable spell that would start with one extra copy of the enchanter at 34th level(giving a 7 percent chance of monster missing) and moving to say 5 copies at 60 (giving a 35% chance of monster missing).  At any rate this would add to the illusion theme of the enchanter and help address the issue of enchanters getting mangled without having to give ac or hp items.<P>Just my two cents.<P>Sednel Enchanter of Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Oh yeah, he didn't know what they were. Great. How long has he been in charge of reading these boards and speaking in our behalf??????<BR> <BR>Now they must compile a list of enchanter issues!? Well, since every one of these ideas has been posted hundreds of times before that leads me to believe that all those posts were not really 'considered' but instead were disregarded. I mean I'm talking about THOUSANDS of well thought out posts on these issues and where are they now? In some DB archive file, which you are not referencing, instead asking us here to repost. That is [*].<P>Were enchanters made just to help warriors and clerics level up, then they can go away? <P>About the overpowered thing, overpowered has not been defined and it is clearly being used inappropriately. Our class was DESIGNED to work only in groups, so it DOES NOT make us powerfull because groups always want us. DUH! Without a group we die easiest of all. <P>I have SERIOUS issues with the way EQ is poorly produced from development to testing to customer service. I really, really hope you do the right thing here with enchanters. To screw this up would be berry berry, berry bad.<P>Nerf my enchanter and no one will ever see him again.

</FONT><HR>1. "Gift of" line needs to be re-worked. I suggest making it a group spell at pretty much the same mana cost.<P>2. Debuffs have very very small effect of mobs. I suggest switching the debuff from agi/str to ac/atk and in larger numbers (ac/atk are in the 500-1000 range vs str/agi in the 100-200 range at this level thus the effect should be scaled) shaman and necros also affected.<BR>**note** this will affect pvp as we will no longer encumber players with these buffs and perma root or snare them.<P>3. Mez I was fine with this until:<BR>a) You made it so pretty much all of velious is IMMUNE to mez, I know you don't play an enchanter so I'll clue you in...I don't mean they resist..I mean they are flagged so you get a "this spell does not work on this mob" message AFTER you already spent the time and mana casting the spell.<BR>b) The ones that aren't immune are fairly magic resistant which further compounded the problem. <BR>c) Then there is the 54+ mob limit where I have to use GoK (higher level mez spell for 54+ mobs) that is very costly to cast and bounces off mobs left and right due to a) and b)<BR>---------------<BR>What we are asking for here is a bit of work.<BR>1. Give us the "to high" or "giant-flagged" message BEFORE expending mana. (don't say "knowledge defines.." blah! You can't tell a 54 golem from a 55 golem if your level 56 they are both blue!!! And no other class has to memorize the level on every mob in the game and if it is giant flagged or not..or even close to that level of knowledge in any area.<BR>2. Put a little thought into mob selection in the next expansion. if you made all mobs fire based and IMMUNE or 99% resistant to fire druids would be breathing down your necks.<BR>3. Possibly give us some sort of change so we can mez soemthing in velious. You can't leave us half nerfed like this on that continent. I don't know wha tyou can do that won't affect kunark and the original content but we need something in velious. Maybe some sort of "velious-only" mez. I can't beleive you guys did what you did in velious...sigh. Guess who had to make a cleric just so he could do *something* over there.<BR>--------------<BR>4. Illussions - just a small bone please. I like eye of zomm with ultravision, levitiate, and see invis. But anything will do.<P>5. Sentinal -  Just remove it. Sorry about the one guy who says it's useful...but I think your the guy who casts it in crowded zones to see who goes linkdead first.<P>6. Whirl til you hurrl and Dynn's dizzying daught are pretty useless since you guys "fixed" them. A slight tweak in the other direction is required.<P>7. Cast sight line runs us in walls and just sits there.<P>8. Lull line never works for pulling. Better off just having a tank pull. This applies to clerics and paladins too.<P>9. With the addition of the epic haste items that STACK with haste items from gods/dragons/planes tanks are getting to be over 80% haste without buffs. Thus making my secondary role (aka my velious role) ineffective. A lift in the haste cap perhaps..I dunno. Just think about how we feel on high level velious raids when haste is pointless on good portion more tanks everyday and mez doesn't work.<P>10. Pets - I know your stance on pets but let me explain something. As a 50+ enchanter I'm not good at taunting a mob on me to activate my pet and living through it. Usually if a mob hits me...it's the one I'm trying to mez...and if the pet hits that one I'm FUBAR. At low levels this isn't an issue but at high levels it certaintly is. Besides in velious....my only way to help the gang out is through my lame pet since haste is less needed (and my epic just furthers that) and mez is futile. And now your saying the only way I can get the pet to work is to taunt a level 55+ mob on me and take a few hits. Yeah, nice idea...you do it and I'll watch.<P>11. Charm - with the exception of dictate it's capped too low. I'm only level 57 but on most raids or even single group adventures a good deal of mobs I fight can NOT be charmed. And alot of those that cannot be charmed can also not be mez'd without using the 350mana 18sec mez. It's to the point where if we get 3 shrooms in a very well tuned group of people averaging around level 57 it's very very dangerous. 3 level 54'ish mobs giving SIX well played level 57+ chars a very hard time.<P>12. Tashanian should be slightly more effective, and less taunt.<P>13. Raids. Uber mobs. The final fight. We are typically useless except maybe mana seive and tash. The only thing I can think of to help is a line of spells similar to boon of the garou (illus werewolf on other, 100dex, 35atk, lifetap proc) So we could devote more spell slots to just keep the other player buffed. Or maybe some sort of CHARGED effect. I cast a spell on tank X and he in turn procs for a large amount of dmg (say my nuke is 250 mana 500dmg then the proc is 250mana 100 dmg but through the tank...and I have to keep casting it on him for each proc. Something besides rune to cast....rune isn't meant to be chain cast at 10.5pp a shot. See the cleric thread for more details on price of reagents.<P>14. Everyone knows enchanters die more then anyone else in the game due to having to engage 3-5 mobs single handledly in cloth while the entire raid focuses on one mob. I don't know what you can do about this but when you balance us keep in mind how often we die compared to every other class. It's like we still have a class based exp penalty and should be taken into account.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The suggestion to have a 30 minute recast time on it would be detrimental to how lots (in fact all) of enchanters who I know use it.<P>A good enchanter can have two wolves running about for the hard fights.

That's 2 wolves at once.<P>Plus it allows for more fun with the faster recast time.

</FONT><HR>Thanks Absor for taking the time to read my earlier post.<P>Here are a few notes to help you better understand our plight.<P>You asked baount our request to get a message if a mob is unmezzable before the spell casts on the targetted mob.<P>This isnt a question of us getting resisted.<BR>Many mobs in the game are immune to mezz or stun without any check to its magic resistance.Many giants and upper levle mobs are immune to stuns. Many times these mobs are niot easily xlassified as giant class by visual inspection. Some rock gloems in the hole are unmezzable do to them being in the old world and levle 53 plus. But to a 56 enchanter a 53 rock golem and a 52 rock golem is just another blue rock golem. If we cast mezz on it and it cant be mezzed but still aggros on us then we are dead instantly.<P>It is standard procedure in high level groups to cast Synbol of naltron or marzin on the puller and the nechanter and the rest get symbol of pizarn because the people who are most likely to die are the enchanter and the puller in that order.<P>We die so much very few people ever reach the highest level as an enchanter it is very frustrating. I often get tells from across the world to join groups because there isnt another high level enchanter online.<P>I have around 100 days play time and I am level 56.<P>Mostly because of the inability to solo well and the fact that I die often.(I know druids and necro's with half the play time that are higher level than me)<P><BR>We need either an increase of our defensive or dodge skills or better equipment similiar to flayed skin armour for necros.<P>Basically to allow us to level on par with our guildmates we need higher ac.<P>This unlike most of the topics discussed is an "Balance Issue"<P>All the other suggestions are important but having more innate or equipment based ac would do a lot for our survivability.<P>I wear tons of all all ac equipment in order  to survive.<P>Thanks Again<P>Magiuos Myndflayer<BR>56 Enchanter<BR>Solusek Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>/em apology for the slightly off topic post<P>To the necro posting:<P>Clarity cast by a level 40 enchanter will outpace anything that call of bones can do.  Lower level clarity is not as fast as initially.  Trust me on this one. My constant running mates are 2 necros.. both in thier 40's.  They jump for joy when the see me getting online because call of bones is too darn slow.  When the first got it it was fast.  Then they gained levels.  Then I gained levels. <P>I tend to level much slower than them because of deaths - the trend for the enchanter to die first when things go wrong is very real - class too powerfull - laughable in the extreme)<P>Anyway, I digress... until you get Lich I would stick withj getting clarity from any enchanter that is 40+... it will be much much faster than call of bones.  I typically never cast on a Necro because I know what it is to run with 2 necros all the time.  Most enchanters dont so just chalk it up to them trying to be nice guys, sigh, them move on with the thought that there are nice people in the ganme willing to help others.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>heh oops..more to come<P>15. Memroy flux...level 55 spell and it can't wipe a level 45 mobs memory. Yeah that's kinda useful..NOT. It works the same as memory blur (level 8 and like 1/20th the mana cost) and then atone (level 39 CLERIC blur). This should be "upped".<P>16. /pet get lost...it's been said already but hey..it needs a mention.<P>17. Charmed pets need to change name color. Sure "oh but that makes it too easy to understand the enchanter" yeah, I understood a tank since level one no color changes needed. Get over it and make difficulty as balanced as you can unless your going to unbalance us in another area to make us more powerful. They should know which is our pet. In RP terms I would  make it do a dance next to me before sending it in to battle. Telling them "a bok shaman is charmed" does no good if your fighting 3 of them unless you can make it obvious to them...which you should be able to do.<P>18. feign death with a long recast/cast time. I like it. Basically only used to AFK since with 10 sec cast or longer you will not get it off in a fight.<P>19. We used to have control of factions but in velious without killing even one giant I can't walk through KAEL as an AGNOSTIC human using any illussion and collaboration. If I killed giants I could understand...but I did not. Now some of them are dubious...but not all are. I should be alble to illussions giant and collaborate and get to amiable and then as I kill giants make myself unable to enter kael in safety. That is how enchanters were pre-velious. <P>Of course pre-velious I could mez mobs and haste meant more because I wasn't competing with epics....so I should have just assumed you nerfed collaboration as well. Unfortunately I didn't and it cost me a few deaths trying to retrieve a corpse that should have never existed.<P>You know I don't really play in velious much anymore...I think you will find few enchanters do...<P>Velious should have a big sign near the dock that reads "enchanters go home".</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Perhaps the addition of something like a DoT-pet would help.<P>Really, where the majority of higher level enchanters are expressing their concern is that there are too many creatures that are immune to mesmerization-type (and secondarily charm) spells.  As I noted earlier, Im not real sure that we can increase the functionality of those spells because they would simply over-balance the enchanter in those encounters (encounters where one or two very strong enemies are intended to challenge large groups, and one charm or mesmerization spell would eliminate all or half of the challenge).<P>Im not sure that Ive seen an answer to this situation that will work.<P>Rampage:  This line does not stack with other strength buffs.  We should evaluate this, and decide if this is how it should be.<P>DoT Pet:  Something not unlike the clerical hammer spell, to add more to the ability of the enchanter to help during fights with extremely high hit point enemies.<P>Illusions:  Mostly, you want more illusions.  There are also a few requests to add effects to some illusions.<P>Illusion, Wolf:  There has been a call to have this spell grant Spirit of Wolf.  If it gets no Spirit of Wolf component, then perhaps it could work indoors.  Ill have it on the list.  I am very much against such homogenization of the classes.  In fact, so much so that I dont really think that enchanters should even be allowed to transform into wolves at all.<P>Illusion, Gender:  Seems like a good request.<P>Illusion, Group Elemental (or race):  A spell that grants the elemental illusions (or race) to the group.<P>Illusion, Change Size:  Some sort of illusion that makes the caster bigger or smaller.  This is something that I am against, assize change is really the area of the shaman.<P>Illusion Monster (and any copycat illusion):  a spell that lets the enchanter copy the appearance of either a random monster in the zone, or a targeted creature.  Faction issues will most certainly disallow this, but its listed.<P>Major Illusion:  If possible, a high level spell (even 60th if needed) that has the functionality of the original minor illusion spells.  One that brings back the enormous illusions that were possible with that spell.<P>Illusion face:  Would give the enchanter a random face. <P>Illusion Races Bug:  It seems that some illusions dont resize the character properly to people that enter the zone after the illusion is cast.  We should take a look for the giant gnomes and see if we can fix them.<P>Undead Illusions:  I, frankly, feel that enchanters shouldnt have these spells.  I will ask that we look at them, and consider that they are the territory of the necromancer.<P>Phantom armor:  It would be awesome to create an illusion spell that allowed the enchanter to look like he is wearing plate.  Perhaps a new spell similar to the magician phantom line (perhaps just like it) that has this illusionary effect (and we should also think of adding this to the magician spells...)<BR> <BR>Enchanting Items:  I will add this to the list as a reminder.<P>Lull spells:  These spells seem to be resisted too easily, more often used to pull than to break up a group.  There should be at least a fair chance that the creature resisting this spell will not immediately aggro.<P>Bard Lute:  We should at least look at this loot.  Even if we dont remove it (it is a very rare item), we should keep it in mind when making new items.  It gives a key enchanter ability to another class.<P>Voice Graft:  We should evaluate the idea of giving this spell to all pet classes, including enchanters.<P>Whirl til you hurl and Dyn's Dizzying Draught:  Players feel that these spells are too easily resisted and too easily broken.<P>Mesmerization spells:  There are some targets that are unaffected by these spells, either due to level or race.  Our anti-undead spell lines give the character back a message when he tries to cast on an invalid target, and the spells dont even cast (costing the caster no mana).  We should consider this approach for mez spells as well.<P>Mesmerization spells and overwriting:  Are single target mez spells supposed to overwrite area of effect mez spells?  It seems that perhaps they should.  Minimally, higher level mez spells should overwrite lower level mez spells.<P>Mesmerization (Charm) Indicator:  I, personally, dont really like this idea.  But there is a call for a change of the color of a monsters name when it is under the effects of mez and charm so that people know by looking.<P>Low level Evocation practice spell:  Enchanters dont seem to have a spell like Flare with which they can practice their evocation skills early on.<P>Tiny Daggers:  These items are unavailable in Qeynos.  This needs to be fixed<P>Pet Positioning:  Because enchanters cant tell there pets where to go, they often get in the way.  There is a tendency with all pets to stand right in front of their master.  This is a bit of a pain when the caster is trying to target something, or just trying to see something.  Can we have pets (all pets) default to standing behind their master?<P>'Charm wears off':  players report that this message is sometimes sent long after the charm has worn off, after the creature is dead sometimes.<P>Reoccurring Amnesia: The reports are pretty overwhelming, this spell does not reoccur.<P>Boon of the Clear Mind:  This is a group clarity spell, and should probably overwrite Clarity, and it does not.  Either spell should probably overwrite the other, basically just increasing the duration (and the same should apply to the clarity 2 spells).  It also seems that this spell has a very short useful life span.  Lowering the level of this spell would allow its use for longer before they get Clarity 2.<P>Failure Messages:  Some spells (Lull series and stuns against giants are primary examples) give the same message on failure that they do on success. If it fails it probably should say so.<P>Mask Faith:  Players have been asking for the ability to mask their religion for a while.  I think this is a bad idea.  But I have a logical argument in favor of it, so Im presenting it.  I like the idea of characters having to deal with their religious choice, even enchanters.  But, well, they aren't anymore because by now every single new enchanter is being told by their mentors to restart their characters as agnostic.  That's something that I don't like at all.  The solution to the problem here (the problem being that there are now very few enchanters that are not agnostic) might be moving their spells so they dont have to enter dangerous cities (which they cant get into if they have a religion), or making religion more valuable.<P>Cantana (a bard song) and Clarity:  I was under the impression that clarity spells would stack with bard mana regeneration songs.  There might be something wrong with the stacking of these two spells.  It seems that the bard song will stack over the enchanter spell, but the song must be stopped or the enchanter spell wont take.<P>Blanket of Forgetfulness:  Is this spell supposed to be more effective than it is?<P>Collaboration:  This spell does not seem to have any affect in Skyfire, but it does in Kael Drakkal. Is this a bug?<P>Illusions and Link Death:  Can we make it so that Illusions remain up during a link death (not during zoning, though).<P>The Essential Enchanter:  We should look into why an enchanter is considered essential in a Kunark group, and perhaps change that.<P>Resplendent Robe:  The effect is Rune IV, but it requires a component?  That seems wrong.<P>Rune IV:  The cost of the gem used to cast this spell might be too high.<P>Boon of the Garou:  We should probably up the duration by thirty seconds or something, so that the spell can be kept up on two targets without it dropping (the duration is currently exactly twice the recast time).<P>Tash Line:  The thought from the players is that this line causes too much aggro.  I dont know if its that way for balance or if it is perhaps an exaggeration.  We should look at this.<P>Recast Bug on fast spells:  After casting a spell, sometimes attempts to cast fast casting spells (Tash line, for example) will not cast right away, and will give a "this spell is not ready message".<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My main disappointment with enchanters is post 55.  For 1-55 I thought the class was well balanced and a good contribution to any group.  Post 55 though as many people indicate we get reduced to casting C2 and Haste.  This is especially true around level's 56+ where mobs become either unmezzable or require GOK/Rapture/Dictate to control.  Our primary function has always been in my mind crowd control first (shamans are and should be better buff/debuff).  Now at the peak of our levels we have spells that last for a third of the duration of dazzle for three times the mana.  I almost exclusively use Rapture because at least I know it isn't going to be resisted *IF* the mob is mezzable.  GOK on the other hand will shoot out a lot of resists (at about a bar of mana a cast).  Totally going against the increased mana efficiency other classes see (or at least holding the same efficiency as we did prior to ROK/SOV).<P>A lot of comments on this thread comes from people who are sub 56 who in general view the class as killer or are worried about getting more illusions.  If I were in their shoes I would probably be posting the same thing.  But after several months at 60 lots and lots of enchanters are hanging up their shoes.  Because what made the class fun for the first 55 levels isn't continued for the last 5-6.  <P>And on a closing note the casting times on Resplendent gear is just whacked.  30 seconds for regular clarity??  I can sit down and med for 30secs and get more then enough mana to cast c2.  The robe is useless at 30secs as well for the most part.  Compared to the other classes SOV gear our effects blow.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"Undead Illusions: I, frankly, feel that enchanters shouldnt have these spells. I will ask that we look at them, and consider that they are the territory of the necromancer."<P>--As the masters of illusion, why should it be so strange for an enchanter to take the form of a skeleton? Is it anymore unusual than taking the form of an elemental or werewolf? As masters of illusion, supposedly, we should be able to make ourselves look like almost anything really.<BR>It's nice that you're worried about not diluting the classes. Since you feel that way, can you tell us why mesmerize was given to necros, and why necros were given the ability to regenerate mana faster than Clarity 2?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052705&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052705&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
