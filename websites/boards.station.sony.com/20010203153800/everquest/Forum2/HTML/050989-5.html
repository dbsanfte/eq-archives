</FONT><HR>Remember, Absor, it is not just more damage, but damage mastery that Wizards are supposed to have, isn't it?  Wizards are supposed to be the Direct Damage experts, the specialists who have skill and ability above and beyond the others not just in raw damage but in finesse, ability, speed, and efficiency.<P>To this end, the lack of several damage for several spell CIRCLES is troubling.  So is the slowness of DD spells as they increase in levels, and so is the lack of draught and lure type spells at lower levels.<P>I don't know how far back on this you remember, but before Kunark came out, Wizards were talking about having fast, lower damage blasts they could call on for an emergency (Draught) and lower resist or unresistable blasts (Lure).  This was before you could even get ABOVE level 50, it was percieved as a real problem and need for the class by general consensus.<P>After Kunark comes out, those ideas found reality in the lure and draught line -- above level 50.  That is great, wonderful for the guys that level.  But the need and problems before level fifty STILL EXIST.<P>Philosophy of class design.  That's where the answers lie, why and how was the class built this way and what should it be?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Heres an Idea....  How about making the targetable AE spells agro everything on the target that the spell is emanating from but make it only happen if the target is a PC....  this would be useless in any out of group situation as the mobs would still agro on the caster. However it would make the AE line not draw every mob not being taunted by the tank to the caster...and hense make the line a little more usefull in group situations.. thuis making the wizards more group centric. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The Low Levels<P>Wizards struggle greatly at the lowest levels, more than any other class.  Lacking pets, healing, combat skills, armor class, and superior hit points, Wizards die, and die a lot.  The Wizard is the least survivable class in the game at the lowest levels, you just get used to it and go on.<P>Now, again as I noted earlier, if the concept is "start weak, get powerful" we have a working class, but the idea of the classes is "everyone is balanced and viable, especially at the end game."  So what we have is a class that just is a punching bag with no pay off later on.<P>The fix?  Well there are a lot of ideas, but here are the easiest ones:<P>-Make Root less resistable at the initial cast.  It should land more reliably, it can hold just like now, but when you cast root, you should have a reasonable expectation that it will take hold.  I can't even count the number of times I have had to cast root 4 and 5 or more times before it holds, and sometimes it breaks so fast the monster doesn't even slow down.  Root is the Wizard's defense.<BR>-Fix Fade/Shadowstep/Yonder line so it will port up again, like it used to.  Make it port around trees, buildings, etc.  Further, starting at Shadowstep, have it port a minimum distance of 1 foot per level the Wizard has achieved.  Yonder should port 2 feet minimum.  This means the Wizard has a reasonable expectation that he will actually GO somewhere when the spell is cast, whereas right now it will quite often dump you 2 feet from the monster.<P>Here are the other fixes that could be done, ones that you might consider extreme or too much work, but remember this class design concept is NOT viable any more.<P>-Increase damage at lowest levels.  Clerics and Druids should never out damage a Wizard with a single blast, not indoors, not outdoors, not against undead, not ever.  That just isn't a rational design concept.  If the Wizard class followed the weak/powerful model, we might have something but not the way Everquest is made now.<BR>-Add in small skin spells at lower levels.  These could use small reagents and have little damage absorbing components, but that spells the difference between life and death at level 16.  Adding in one that uses a Malachite at level 4 (when Magicians get pets) would give Wizards a level of protection that they don't have now.<P>That's for the lowest levels, below level 20.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Quite simplely if a Wizard is a seeker of knowledge then he should be the most efficent user of all his magics. When he hits the high ends which i believe is about 40+ then with his knowledge that he has gained he should be able to have, through a skill, do these things:<P>Faster Mana regen...you've seeked out the knowledge so now you can use it. Why deopend on an enchaters clarity you are the master of knowledge so you should be able to regen mana as fast without clarity because of a skill base you have attained through your knowledge.<P>Spells that actually cast faster/cost cheaper and hit harder. Again through a skill you are able to do this thus being more usefull in the higher lvl groups.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>TOOLFreak:<P>"New Wizard description?<P>Wizards seek out knowledge, but have less quests and class specific items than anyother quests. This is why they are always seeking knowledge and never finding it. They are the second best teleporters of all the two classes that teleport in Norrath! Although, sometimes they teleport you to places where you will be dead before you arrive. When it comes to offensive magic, wizards are pretty average! But they are selfish, and can provide nothing to others and even less when out of mana."<P>This is so true it made me cry.

</FONT><HR>I have played a wizard for quite a while, and think some things should be changed...<P>The biggest problem, is with the tears spells hitting pets, and being highly resistable.  Make 50+ rain spells less resistable, in line with our other 50+ damage spells, and make them stop hitting pets.<P>Concerning 50 - 60 Kunark spells...<P>Disintigrate<BR>This spell is only useful against green mobs (it works on low blues, but the odds make *hoping* it will hit, unrealistic).  I'm not sure what the idea behind this spell was, but right now the only use it has is to help a wizard who wants to farm a dungeon, break the spawn up using less mana.  This spell needs to leave a corpse, or have it's level increased to 49.<P>Flaming Sword of Xuzl<BR>This spell needs to have 0 taunt, and 1000hps.  for 700 mana, I get a sword that lags everyone, does 10 damage, and is killed by a riposte.  The only use for this spell is for dueling (strech), wizards cast this spell once, and never use it again.  increase the HPs, and give it 0 taunt so that it won't tank, but won't die from ripostes and random attacks.<P>Tears of Solusek, Druzzil, Prexus<BR>These spells are nice, they require strategy and skill to use correctly, if you can keep a mob in the rain for 3 waves, you will do very effecient damage... if you can keep him in the rain.  However, these spells are highly resisted.  I get over 30% resistance from average mobs, making them not mana effecient.  They also hit pets.  These spells need to have the same resistances as all our draughts, AEs, etc.  They should not hit pets either.<P>Atol's Spectral Shackles<BR>This costs more mana, and fizzles a lot.  Unless you absolutely need the extra increase in casting time, this spell is a complete waste.  It needs to fizzle less, and have a duration that is twice as long as bonds of force.<P>Al'Kabor spells, all of them...<BR>Okay, let's be honest, these spells suck, plain and simple... yadda, yadda, they are powerful in the right situation... what situation?  Either admit these spells are a joke, or fix them.<P>Eye of Tallon<BR>This spell is basically the same as Eye of Zomm, but has the annoying sight spell on it... made by someone who hasn't a clue.  This spell needs to have it's duration increased to double Eye of Zomm... or have a movement increase, or be invisible to undead/invisible, or something like that... also, it needs to have a swimming skill of 100 or 200, instead of 1!  Make it fly or something... Eye of Zomm is a great tool for pulling and scouting, would be nice if Eye of Tallon extended that.<P>Root spells...<BR>All root spells seem to get some sort of extra check every 30 seconds, and they break almost constantly... what's up with that?  This should be fixed.  If I cast fetter, on a mob with low MR, it should last the full 2 minutes, at least 50% of the time.<P>Have our Draught line of spells continue to increase in damage all the way to 60, so that Druaght of Fire, Ice, and Voltaic Draught all do the same damage, instead of draught of Ice doing about 100 points more damage than the other two.<P>Give use a 50+ resistance spell that gives us +20 or +25 to all resistances.  We have these at low levels, up to the 40s, but after Kunark came out, they were neglected.<P>Make plainsight stack with our infravision spell, instead of DMF... DMF should stack with levitate.<P>Merloc</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The idea of summoning a running monster is a good one.  How about the opposite as well:  Banish.<P>This spell would teleport the mob a good distance away from the party and give them a small amount of time to heal up or even med.<P>Either of these spells should enrage the monster and aggro him on the wizard when he returns or is summoned, therefore making it risky to cast and putting the wizard's life on the line.<P>To avoid the problem of wizards banishing monsters when they are soloing, simply give it a somewhat long casting time and make it be resistable to some extent.  Wizards can already kite so this wouldn't be that much different.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hello, My name is Enoch and I play an Everquest wizard. I suppose play is a bit strong of a word. I find myself mostly used for transport, if used at all. There is no easier way to silence the ooc chatter in a zone than to ooc "wizard looking for group." I will agree with most of the suggestions mentioned in the many post before this one. I will add my suggestion now. I may have missed a similar suggestion so if this is a repeat then forgive me. <P>Here it is:<BR>I have read some posts about familiars. I like the idea of a non combative familiar that I can summon. But what would it do that would be benefical to me? Well, here it is. It would be a manasink. It would have to be summoned and no rent. As I am sitting around waiting for the tank to heal or for the rest of my group to arrive, I could dumb a little of my mana into my manasink familiar. When I am in the middle of battle and need that extra bit of mana. I call upon my familiar to make the ultimate sacrifice and return all of the mana that I have stored in it. I would not be able to take a portion. I would have to take it all. The familiar being a magical being that no longer has any mana, would be unsummoned and disappear. I suppose that possibly, the familiar could alos sustain itself on the mana I provide it. That way I could not just stock pile loads of mana with no consequence. If the familar is attacked and killed, the sudden release of the mana I have previously stored in it would stun the attacker and possibly damage said attacker. The familiar would never attack any mob or defend itself from any attacker. <P>Well, that is my suggestion for helping us out a little.<P>Enoch<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<BR>       I think a greater mana regeneration rate would greatly benifit wizards (as well as other casters). What good is all this power wizards have (I have some suggestions for this later) if they are drained of it's usage quickly.  I liked an idea someone posted about group mana regen (it encourages grouping and that's good, I like grouping.)<BR>       Damage is also an issue with wizards...I don't think they do enough of it.  I hate it when many casters of the same level can do damage very close to mine.  Basiclly I think wizard spell damage should be increased (the critical hit suggestion also sounded good.. but x2 or x3 damage seems a bit ridiclous).  I know PvP is probably an issue, so if you raised the damage agaisnt mobs but kept it the same for PvP I don't think there would be many problems.<BR> <BR>Absor... I hope you really consider some of the things we wizards are saying...we desprately need improvements. (Please... do what the players want...it won't unbalance the game.

</FONT><HR>Medium Low levels<P>At level 16, Wizards get their first skin spell and start to measurably out damage their opponents.  16 is actually a fairly good level for Wizards, they have good protection and decent damage output, plus a great AE spell in Pillar of Fire.  Unfortunately we run into different problems.<P>Level 20 gives Wizards self ports, which is pleasent, its a break point many have been striving toward.  While we get fewer locations than Druids (can't get to Freeport area until level 24, oddly), Druids are masters of travel.  However, there are some real problems.<P>Force Shock is an all-or-nothing interrupt blast that is highly resistable.  Not only does it not get partial resists, but it has a stun/interrupt component that makes it easier to resist.  Unlike Enchanters, who can lower their target's resistances, Wizards just have to watch as the spell bounces, hyper-aggroing the monsters a good 30-60% of the time, depending on the monster.<P>Further, the only other blast that a Wizard has at this point is Tishan's Clash, another highly resisted stun with damage that does less than 40 damage at this level.  In addition, for the Wizard to use cold damage, he has to dip to level EIGHT for the 38 point Shock of Frost blast.  That is a triple whammy that makes many Wizards flat out quit, no lie.  <P>In order to contribute, Wizards are using spells a full circle lower to hope to hit more often, something Magicians can sympathise with - but we don't have pets nor good damage shields to fill the gap.<P>At level 24, the new spell is finally cold, after 15 levels without a new one, but it only does 10 more damage than Shock of Force at level 20.  There are some AE spells to use, although they aren't very sparkling.  The mid 20s are very unpleasent for most Wizards, they struggle with few weapons and no real group friendly abilities.<P>At level 29, the Wizard gets an evac and 3 group ports, which help in group friendliness.  Mind you, hardly anyone evacs at these levels, I have used it 3 times in my career even at level 45.  But its something that Wizards bring to the table at least.  Level 29 also brings Bonds of Force, an AE snare spell that can be used in a pinch if none of the other five classes that can snare are missing from the group, and can allow the Wizard to quad kite... eventually.<P>However, the damage output still is not very noteworthy compared to others of the same level range. Further, the 20s bring something painfully to light about Wizards that you didn't run into very often before.<P>Monsters more than 6 levels or 1.2 times the Wizards level in power than the Wizard have an enormous increase in resistances (it is said not to be 100% but it might as well be, there isn't any point in dumping spell after spell into a target and doing nothing in the hopes of getting a few points through).  Hunting in my 20s, it was rare not to face 1-2 monsters PER NIGHT of hunting that were above this cap.  While other classes can contribute using pets, healing, damage shields, buffs, or just beating on the brute... Wizards have nothing, not a thing to offer.  That is a weakness of the class, but where is it compensated for?  To have a distinctive and intentional design flaw like that, one would expect a proportional increase in ability in special cases, but where is it?  This is especially painful in the 20s due to the way the formula works, until level 34 or so, the formula doesn't exceed the 6+ level cap.<P>How to fix this?  Pretty simple really.<P>-Add in a blast or two each level, so that every level the Wizard gets at least 2 Direct Damage attacks, not including stun spells.  They should be scattered across types of damage, so that the Wizard never has to dip more than 1 spell circle to get a given type of damage.  Either this is a strength of the class or it is not.  It should be, and isn't presently.<P>-Increase the 6+/1.2 cap for Wizards to 8+/1.3 which would have minimal effect overall, but would help these levels significantly.  Afraid of rampaging bands of Wizards stalking the land annihilating monsters 8 levels higher than their level?  Not going to happen.  Resistances, hit points, and damage done by the monsters are far too high, if we could do it, we'd do it to monsters 6 levels over our heads.  Ever seen that?  Me either.<P>-Look at AE spells across the first 30 levels, make sure they are all viable and efficient enough to use regularly.  If they aren't used at these levels, they will not be in most groups higher, because you get kind of set in your way at higher levels.  This is partly human nature and mostly the "if I die I lose a full night's work in xps without a res" effect.<P>Dream fixes:<P>-Add in a Lure at level 29.  Why Lures?  First off, monsters are starting to have notable resistances, and some are even immune to magic (EXG in Sol A) at this power level which shuts out Wizards TOTALLY at this point.  <BR>-As an alternate, treat lures as if they are immune to the level cap (only these highly mana inefficient spells ignore the 6+ resist cap).<BR>-Add in a Draught at level 20.  Why?  because at level 20 your spells are starting to become very slow, so slow that you will find yourself challenged to get off that last blast in an emergency.  Due to the 'cannot see your target' effect when a goblin gets his toenail behind a bump in the floor, you must tag monsters NOW to stop them.  Further, a spell that casts faster than 3 seconds is never going to be fast enough to be considered quick damage.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OK after reading practly EVERY post.. LoL yes ur right i have no life but who does when playing EQ=) i have come to see the main points i like and that NEED to be changed i say need instead of should be or i would want to be because they are needed... Wizards are so wacked it's crazy let me explain.<P> To have choosen a wizard you read the description (or remember what they are from past PRG's) and realize this is the class to be if u want massive direct dmg... ok this was ture but why be a wizard nemore when mages dd are very close to our plus they get pets and dmg shield EASILY out damaging us. <P>  Long ago i remember when pallys and rangers were having all the big problems and verant came and helped them along... now here is a line (or as close as i can remember) to what was said Rangers will never be as good of a tank as a warrior most/all of their fighting skills will be lesser skill level in order for them to cast... it's the same thing with pallys and SKs, and guess what warriors ARE the best tanks( Higest Hps decent dmg good taunts ect) Now let's look at this same logic w/ the casters. The Wizard is the warrior of casters he was made to deal damage! yet his spells are not nearly what they should be. Magicans get pets and damage shields and good nukes, enc get decent nukes and awsome crowd control and a pet (extremely dumb/crappy but a pet none the less) Necros um mana regen spells great dots pets wow what a class  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> all of these classes are made to do their own jobs and do them very well! Now Wizards are to do dmg right? ok well they do do more magical dd dmg than anyother class... is this balanced LoL keep reading to find out    Now in velious w/ the 100k+ hp mobs wizards can't dent them our high dds aren't worth casting thanks to resists and what will a 800dmg lure do to one of these uber mobs? OK now some may say well that's just in fighting Uber mobs if u dont' like it why fight em. So let's look at wizards in regular play we can't heal, buff, or effectively help a group therefore we arn't wanted and this is obivious when i have to search for hours to try to get a friggin group (lol this is because i'm not an unskilled or jackass wizard... well i don't think i am at least <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> We don't want to heal buff or nething either or we wouldn't have been wizards we are ment to group! Verant made wizards and THE dd casters and he MUST group (w/ some exception) yet they can't effectively help ne group for once he's oom which happens QUITE often in the life of a wizard he sits on his arse and meds and meds and meds while the rest of the casters can send pets in or in case in enchanters they are a great assit to a group w/ crowd control ect. Well enough flaming the wizards this isn't helping any all i'm doing is shinging light on only a FEW of the probs i c<P>Now for the helpful part <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">I very much agree w/ the poster above who <BR>Warrior: BEST TANK : Yep<BR>Cleric: BEST HEALER: Yep<BR>Wizzard: BEST MAGIC DMG: um... no<BR>TO make wizards balanced u need to do the following:<BR>1) Like you did with warriors because they were the basic tank and wizards beign the basic caster u need to make it so their skills can advance higher than the otehr casters.<BR>2) Increase our mana regen (why is it that we regen mana at the same speed as Magicans when they have a pet kicked arse while they med?<BR>3) DD dmg agreed w/ everyone else to make it balanced we need a % dmg spell so it won't harm our soloing yet will greatly help w/ uber mobs<BR>4) teleports ack that's dangerous i'd much rather have a druid as a group member.<P>One last thing think for a second when u are making a group would u actually want a wizard in it when all he is susposed to do it damage yet magicans out dmg them not to mention MANY other classes? oh but waite we have evacs doh so do do druids plus the evacs are safer and they can deal decent dmg and heal...lol<P>Fyer<P>P.S. wow after reading that i realize it sux sorry for all the mispelling and grammer mistakes i'm REALLY tired but try to make some sence out of it hehe wizards really need some large changes in order for anyone to enjoy the class at higher lvs and after beign so weak and difficult at low levels i think we have somthin comin to us <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am adamant in my assertion that we need to be tweaked to level of destructive power we're entitled to after enduring being the most crippled class out there for the first 3/4 of our levels. Anything less is a complete retraction of what we were led to believe when we chose the class to begin with.

</FONT><HR>Medium Levels<P>Level 34, the Wizard has all the main ports he needs, able to get all basic locations and take people with him.  This is very useful for the class, I won't deny it.  It won't get you xps nor a group and we all know killing things is the only way to advance and what EQ is about, but they are quite nice nonetheless.  Further you get a pair of very efficient, useful AE spells, the kind ALL AE should be patterned after.  These allow the Wizard to start doing reliable AE grouping, taking out crowds of monsters at once.<P>But we have a real problem here with damage again.  Not only does the Wizard (once more) only have ONE blast, but it actually does less damage than the Magician bolt at this level.  Yes, bolts are line of sight and thus can miss, yes, Magicians go 10 levels between blasts.  But they do EVERY time they get a bolt, and the Wizard ALWAYS has a way to out damage the Magician that level.  This is the only level that isn't true, and when you throw in a pet and damage shields, well.... there just isn't any contest.<P>Your damage output at level 39 is pretty respectable, it goes up a notable amount, and Concussion is available this level.  There isnt a single level 39 Wizard on the planet that has it, you just can't get the spell without a crowd of 50s, but its at this level.  But the damage is slow, very slow.  Instead of being fast damage, Wizards are slow damage now, you hit the cast button and cross your arms.  will the monster be dead by the time it goes off?  Will something interrupt you?  This is absurd, the casting times just keep going up.<P>Level 44 the power increases again, giving you the first fire DD you have had since level 29 (thats 15 levels again, if you are counting).  A Lure has been added this level, which is good because Verant keeps adding scattered creatures that are spellproof around Norrath.  Level 44 is the first level you finally feel like a Wizard, its when you can look at your class and damage and say 'oh wow, I really rip stuff up!'<P>But then we see Diamondskin, which has a component ten times the cost of the previous skin spell for about 150 more hit points protection.  This is just a head scratcher for everyone, it follows the same concept as the symbol for Clerics, a gigantic increase in cost for the component with a small increase in effect.<P>What to do to fix this<P>What to do:<P>-Add in more blasts, of course, this continues to all levels only 1 blast is given before level 50.<BR>-Raise the damage of the level 34 blast to exceed the Magician one.  It doesn't have to be a huge amount, but it should be noteworthy damage, at least 20-25 more damage.<BR>-Lower the difficulty level or raise the spell level of concussion quest.  Either the quest is way to hard or the spell is way too low level.  How could this have possibly gotten past testers?<BR>-Add in a Draught spell, to give quick damage these levels with decent mana cost.<BR>-Increase the protection effect of Diamondskin.  Monsters (especially in Kunark and Velious) hit incredibly hard, and this skin just doesn't but 1-2 more hits longer than Steelskin, at 10 times the cost.  I understand the econ guys want that plat out of the game, but why does it have to be on something this poor?  Nobody will buy the gems and use this spell if its this ineffective, and that kind of negates the point of the cost doesn't it?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hail. I am a wizard of level 52 and I have been playing this char scince the game has been out. Yes I know I level slow but being a wizard is very hard to find a group. So I tend to have to solo and that get quite boring. <P>Anyways my complaint and balance issue that I believe needs to be corrected is the resist that we get compare to all other classes. Wizard get laughed at all the time for being in a group and cast a spell such as Ice Comet and bang resist. Yes you fixed it with Lure of Ice/Frost (I forget.) But still that spell is high mana cost compare to one cast of Ice Comet. When I was level 34 I loved doing quests for my wizard. I believe I did all the quests for wizard possible before the Kunark expansion (started playing other chars.) Now I'm not sure if you remember but there was a quest reguarding the Staff of Temperate Flux...since the day I got it I have carried this around with me all the time. Its a great stuff for debuffing but when your in a group or high level mobs. The amount you have to click to make it so the enemy would not even resist your spell is ridiculous (especially at higher level.) That and the group gets VERY annoyed at seeing the phrase "Your targets begins to feel uncomfortbale." Being spammed up your entire screen. Also at higher level the enemy (I think) takes more right clicking to say loose their resistance. I used this staff on myself and it takes about 5 Cold and Heat resistance off for each click I do. On the enemies I have to do like 20 or more just to make my Ice Comet spell hit FULL DAMAGE. I believe its the perfect debuff item we get but can you tweak it up a little that higher level enemies resist it alot less? Maybe have it debuff 20 Cold and Heat resistance instead of 5. Or better yet take that stupid phrase out of there! <P>Thanks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have seen people mention post 50 crowd controll.  I have thought that a great addition to the Wizard line would be a "turn to stone/ice/...".  If the spell would totally immobileize (sp) a mob (no movement or casting ability) AND increase it's AC and Magic resist,  it wouldn't be too exploaitable,  but would be usefull only for crowd control.  Increasing the AC and MR while under the effect would greatly reduce the damage the Mob would take if you attempted to attack it.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Ok, i'll give it a whirl as well.<P>1. Al'Kabor Spells, I don't have much to mention here because they have gotten so dusty in my spell book I am not quite sure why I would ever use one.  I tend to stick with PBAE spells since its easier to not get myself damaged, and it dosen't cause mobs that resist enchanter stuns to run around, taking various mobs out of the next AE range.<P>2. Rain Spells, I think Grimstaff said it best on the first page of this thread.<P>3. Harvest, is becomming very inefficient once a wizard gets into the 50s.  I generally keep it memed but only incase I need the instant mana, and can't necessarily sit for various reasons (agro).  Perhapse an upgrade is in order?  If the mana gaind back per level was increase it might work a bit better.<P>4. (Nothing to do with Balance just annoying) Weather its too hard to fix or not, its still pointless to have the West Karana gate and the Skyfire Evac in their present locations.  I can actually understand the Cazic gate.  Its a Gate/Portal, your prepaired to go there.  With Skyfire its an evac, ment to be used in emergencies.  Out of the frying pan and all most literally into the fire.  Not to mention I don't see how changing the location of the skyfire wizard evac spot would be hard.  Its not like there are any special graphics associated with its location.<P>5. (Nothing really to do with class balance, just annoying) I know you have said the SoV wizard gate spell vendor was in game.  I believe you, its just annoying that its not as obvious as the Druid one.  Call us wizards dense if you want, but the Druids managed to find theirs inside of a day or two, and to my knowledge no one has found the wizard one to date.  Maybe its only obvious once you know where it is located?<P>6. With reguards to concussion, and many SoV spells.  I am unsure why this quest was made so difficult when the spell is so low?  If you didn't want any old 39th wizard to have the spell you should of just made the spell higher level.<P>     (Not Class Balance Related just puzzeling) I've managed to get 2 spell drops in SoV.  I've killed lots of stuff thats over level 50.  Ive yet to see a spell drop that was 50+, since I don't particularly want to destroy my faction in Faydark I guess I will be forced to wait for the trickel down spell economics to come into play in about 6 months when other wizards all ready have the stuff.<P>7. (Not Balance Related) Thanks for the Staff of Temperate Flux we got way back when.  I still have mine, though I mostly use it for pulling since its a non damage spell that will agro mobs).  Any chance we will get an upgraded version at some point.  Its pretty much a useless toy when it comes to uber encounters, especially when it won't stack with the Necro Scent line of spells and even then after 50 clicks the uber mob just keeps shrugging it off.<P>8. I understand your reluctancy to add another line of spells to a class just to add balance in the game.  However, I have to agree with my fellow wizards that with SoV mobs we have become semi-meeningless.  The problem I see is that if our current spells are tweaked to provide damage proportionally to what we can do to the 32k caped mobs, we would become overpowered in the non SoV encounters.<BR>     A Percent Damage spell, IMHO, appears to be the easiest way to help fix us.  Even at 5% damage for a level 60 wizard it would require 20 level 60 wizards to completely take down a mob.  I am not sure anyone can get that many of us to work together.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Using a 5% dmg spell on anythign but an SoV mob makes the spell totally useless.  With the 32k gods in the non SoV lands a 5% damage spell would only be doing a maximum of 1600 damage which can be accomplished at level 60 with current spells.<BR>     For people that are worried that the NPC mobs will gain these spells too, you need worry not.  Some of the most buffed up warriors in all the land don't even have 10k hit points.  A spell such as this would do less damage to a player than half of an Ice Commet Spell.<BR>     I would think it reasonable to have the following:<BR>Level 60 = 5%<BR>Level 55 = 4%<BR>Level 51 = 3%<BR>Perhapse even a lure version that went something like the following:<BR>Level 60 = 3%<BR>Level 55 = 2%<BR>Level 51 = 1.5%<P>9. Pure Caster Gear.  We keep getting things that give more +int.  I think it would be a challange to find a pure int based caster above level 50 that wasn't all ready at the int cap.<BR>     Ok so we should be using other itmes to give us other abilities once we have 200 int.  Ummm what other items?  I'm not looking for a list of stuff I can look good in.  I am wondering what else should I bother getting after my int is at 200+.  AC gear?  Unless your AC is over 900 at the upper levels the creatures are going to hit for full anyway.  HP gear?  I seriosuly doubt that any +HP items or +STA items are going to make a significant differance in our survivability.<BR>     I am sure this is just a downside of being a pure caster, but aside from changing my looks and being able to say "Hay got one of those" there dosen't seem to be much reason to change your items.  Unless we were to be given more manaless casting options, of which you seem to be opposed.<P>10. (Ok maybe not a "Balance" problem but still very annoying) How difficult is it to complete the Wizard or Magician Epic?<BR>Bard Epic - Helps out the group with its effect, and helps out the Bard with it being used as all instruments.<BR>Cleric Epic - Helps out the group, and saves the cleric mana.<BR>Druid Epic - Has a snare effect, those do help groups from getting runners, not to mention its a manaless dot.<BR>Enchanter Epic - Helps out the Group with Speed buffs, that the Enchanter no longer needs to bother keeping memorized.<BR>Magician - If powerfull pets don't help out a group I don't know what does.<BR>Necromancer - I am not fond of the Necro Epic but it still has utility in that its a manaless dot and it effectively snares mobs for the group.<BR>Monk, Paladin , Ranger, Rogue, Shadow Knight, Warrior Epics - Allows the  to do more damage in their primary focus (melee damage), thus helping the group.<BR>Shamen Epic - Manaless Dot, helps everyone.<BR>Wizard Epic - Damage Absorber with minor clarity like effect.  How does this help anyone but the wizard?  Ok, the clarity effect helps the wizard help the group.  And the Damage shield helps to prevent the need that the wizard will need to be Resurected.  But for the difficulty of obtaining the item I would of hoped for more than just a Save My Own Butt Stick.<P>11. Damage Shields, if it was a mistake to give us one in the first place, why did the SoV design team make that mistake again?  Did they do it just to get a good laugh?  Ok, I realize that our damage shield will stack with other classes damage shield but at present its practically worthless.  Our best damage shield only lasts for 5 min.  Can you look into making this a 30 min or Hour long buff due to the fact that it provides so little damage.  At least then I wouldn't need to have it memorized constantly for it to be of ANY use.<P>12. Except for the Fun factor, and the need for a few junk buffs before a dragon raid.  Most of our vision spells are quite useless.  Perhapse if we could cast these spells on others, though I don't know why others would want them.<BR>     If we are supposed to be seekers of knowledge and the vision spells were put in place to give us some ability in that area, perhapse we need different, or new spells to fill the roll that these spells obviously do not cover.<P>13. Our Pet.  Not sure why we got this spell.  Its not a very mana efficient damage dealer, and as a wizard thats what I believe we are striving to be.  Perhapse if the pet didn't taunt, and couldn't be reposted *unless it was the actual target of a creature)?  So that only its actual damage would cause a mob to attack it?  It would stil probably be fairly useless in any encounter with a creature that had an Area of Effect ability.  With the Hit Points it has its doubtfull it would live through even one gravity flux, unless it had very high magic resist.  And I seriously doubt it would live through a Dragon Roar or a Rampage by any of the Kael Drakken Giants.<BR>     You know with some changes to this pet as described above, it might have more of a use in SoV Uber mob encounters.  If it didn't taunt so much and could somehow avoid being reposted, unless direcly attacked, to death it might give us the damage needed to be usefull on SoV Raids.<BR>     Heck let mobs reposte it, but give it the ability to Dodge all reposte attacks (so that it takes no damage but at least the mob evaded damage as well).  Any Mob worth casting this on will knock it into oblivion once the creature notices it and considers it a threat.<P>14. Ok, I play a wizard most of the time.  Ive managed to acquire 56 levels so far.  I can usually find a group, but most groups take me because of my evac ability and not because of my nukes.  I also have a fair number of friends to call upon for grouping.  For places that don't require evacs or when other group gating classes are available I have been known to sit for a while.<BR>     When I am playing on an alternate character, (I have quite a few) and am looking for people for a group.  I generally don't go out of my way to find a wizard for anything.  If I want an evac in my group I would look for a druid.  If I want a nuker in my group I look for a mage because they also bring damage shields and pets to the group.  I don't dislike to group with wizards, and I won't turn a group down because it has a wizard in it.  I also won't not group a wizard when I need a nuker and no other options present themselves, but I don't think I have ever gone out of my way to find a wizard for an EXP group.  Quite frankly I would prefer to have a druid since they can evac, nuke pretty good, back up heal and have damage shields. (Yes I know druids and shamen are saying that they have trouble back up healing post 50, and I tend to agree with them, but some healing is better than nothing.)<BR>     Why would I want to slow down my groups EXP rate by adding a wizard?  When they don't bring much to the group that can't be compensated for with other classes for the most part?<BR>     Answer: I wouldn't want to, so generally the only time a wizard comes into my group is if I need an evacer and a Druid is not around, or I need a Nuker and a Mage or Druid are not around.  I don't dislike wizard I am just trying to play efficiently.<BR>I don't know if there is much to solve this problem except by making wizards more mana effective.  This can be done by either increasing their meditation rate, or by providing them with more mana efficient spells.  I would tend to go with the first solution since it keeps the wizard balanced for each individual fight.<P>15. Abscond and Evacuate.  Great ideas for spells.  I can understand that maybe some times (small chance) that the hate list is not completely cleared.  However, this spell is ment to be used as an escape from danger spell.  The Evacuate version is pretty good, though I would prefer the casting time reduced (I don't think its a balance thing more of an I would like).  However, Abscond performs the same function for the caster only.  Why does this spell cost twice the mana of the group version.  Sure Abscond has a 2 second less casting time, but is already penalized by a 10 second delay in recast.<BR>     If you have to sit down and memorize either of these spells, and then stand up and cast it, your probably dead anyway if its an emergency.  Ok sure I could keep it memed all the time, but in that case why don't I keep up an evac?  I know I have removed the hate list when I leave the zone...<BR>     As a partial fix for both spells, please have the hate list reduction be put at a minimum of all but the lowest form of mob agro.  It seemes strange to me that if I evacuate my group or abscond away from a mob that it should be allowed to just summon me, or worse a group member back to the creature, before we can even get out of the zone.<P>16.  (This is more of an annoyance) I currently have 2 wizard staff that have clickable effects.  I love clickable effects.  However, I tend to just mem the spells and cast them for these effects.<BR>Lost Staff of the Scorned, unlimited Nektulos Forest Group Gates.<BR>Diamond Encrusted Staff, unlimited Elemental Armor<BR>     Not only do both these staves weigh 10 stones each, requiring me to carry them in a weight reducing container, but they are both two hand blunt weapons.  Requiring that I must take both the items I normally carry in my hands off just to use these staves, that do what?  Save me some mana?<BR>     The mana cost on Elemental Armor is so low that I can probably sit down, mem the spell and cast and be on my way to full mana before the staff gets it off.  Not to mention the time to remove my secondary hand slot item, put it in a pack, open up the pack with the correct staff in it, swap it out for my primary weapon and right click, then put everything back.<BR>     The gate to Nektulos Forest is about the same way.  Its just increadibly annoying to need to swap around between one hand weapon and two hand weapons just to cast off a spell that is easy to cast anyway.  Nither item is designed to be used in a clinch situation, so why make them neusance items to use.<BR>     Can both weapon be changed to one hand blunt weapons with appropriate reductions in damage and delay?  Just a though...<P><BR>I understand that not all the items mentioned here were related to class balance.  I tried to point that out so that you could just skimm past them them if you were pressed for time.  Thank you for considering some much needed changed to the wizard class.  To improve our groupability as well as maintaining our playability in epic encounters of SoV.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, that was a lot of reading.  Besides one meeting, all I've had time to do today is read these class threads and write up very long replies.  So let's get on with it!<P>In general there are few 'balance' issues in this thread.  There are several problems, but things (even seemingly important ones, like the whole Admiral Akbar line of spells) aren't balance issues.  And I want to look at the balance issues first.<P>A bazillion hit points:  The biggest balance issue that I see is the problem that we've given the purely mana dependent wizard in Velious.  Once the mana is gone and the enemy is only partially wounded, the wizard is no longer contributing to the fight (except that he is meditating in preparation for helping out later).  I see this as the single most important issue facing the wizard class as a whole.  And, as I'm discovering with most classes, it's mostly a post 50th level issue.<P>I've seen two basic approaches to a solution to this problem.  Unfortunately, both are very dramatic (though it may require a dramatic change to rectify this issue).  One is simply to increase the wizard's mana reserve, the other is to create a new line of spells that does a percentage of damage based on the current hit points of the target.  Honestly, I don't like either one.  Raising the mana pool would be a terrific balancing problem.  This not only increases the potential damage output of the wizard while he's fighting the bazillion hit point enemy, but at all other times as well.  I can't really see this working.<P>I admit that the % damage spell idea is interesting.  And it does target the problem a lot more specifically.  This also seems like an idea that could cause troublesome balancing issues, but far fewer than the mana pool increase.  It would require a ton of work, assuming that this sort of spell is even possible…<P>There is a third idea that I have, but I can't tell you about because it is based on things that you folks don't get to know (sorry).  But it is not too far from the percentage damage idea anyhow.<P>Regardless, this is the main concern that I have about balancing the wizard class.  And it will probably remain at the top of the wizard list.<P>The other more general issue is about the whole level limit cap on wizard (and everyone else's for that matter) damage spells.  I can see how this would impact a wizard more than others, since they have little to do when they can't blast things.  I'm not sure if this should be changed, but I'll bring it up.<P>With the list below, a + means it's on the list, a – means that it is not on the list, and a ? means that I don't think I understand the problem and need more input.<P>Specific Spells:<P>+ Al'Kabor line of spells:  The consensus is that this spell line is far less useful than the parallel line (pun!) of pillar spells.  It seems that the benefit if a larger area of affect and a single extra target is not worthy of the increased mana cost.  Frankly, it seems that there are no wizards casting this spell in Norrath.  Heck if I know how to fix these.  I'm against any call to simply remove the spell, that does little to actually help anything.  Increasing its radius could be very messy.  Adding more targets might be the best solution.<P>+ Flaming Sword of Xuzl:  Again, I'm against just eliminating what is already there (keep in mind that ideas like 'take away this spell and give us this one instead' don't really work well).  Though I also agree with many of you that wizards shouldn't have pets.  I do like the idea of allowing this thing to work sort of more like a DoT (as with the clerical hammer spell).  Making it immune to spells and riposte might work to make this spell more useful.  In any case, it should be looked at.<P>+ Harvest:  The feeling is that this spell doesn't 'ramp up' properly for levels over 50.  Some want to see this spell recast faster, and I'll suggest it.  But keep in mind that this is, essentially, increasing the wizards mana pool, which is an idea that I am against in general.<P>+ Rain Spells:  I agree that we should think about taking pets out of the equation.  I'm not convinced that more needs to be done than that.  We also might need to look at the resist rates on these spells (in conjunction with everything else).  But I was thinking that we should consider increasing the over-all number of waves a bit (I mean, really, like by 1) but leaving pets in the formula.  This would increase the relative power of wizards.  But that also may not be the best thing to do (since there are people that play magicians too…).  In general, this series should be looked at.<P>- Okiel’s Radiation and the other one:  Sure, not the greatest spells.  But I can't imagine suggesting that they be made better.  So let's just leave them as they are.<P>+ Atol's Apectral Shackles:  As a level 51 spell, it fizzles too much, reportedly more than Fetter a level 58 spell.  I agree that we should review the whole thing with high fizzle rate spells.<P>?  Snare/Enstill:  It sure does seem odd to suddenly get a group snare…  Tell me, would you rather have a group or a single target snare in that spell slot?<P>+ Invisibility to Undead:  I, honestly, don't know why wizards have this spell.  I want to find out why.<P>Teleport Spells:<P>+ West Karana:  Move this portal to the other side of the zone.  This has all of the technical nightmares that I pointed out before (complete rebuilding of the zone and time to download it).  But heck, it's on the list.<P>+ Cazil Thule Gate:  Mana of you think this is in too dangerous of a location.  I'm not sure that there really should be any promise that the place you end up in should be safe.  Use this spell when you know you're gonna die, and any destination is better than where you are.  But I also see your point.<P>+ Fade/shadowstep/yonder:  These spells have problems going vertically.  I'm not sure that this can be fixed, but if it can, it should be.<P>+ Evacs:  I agree that it would be nice if Evacs would take link-dead characters.  I have no idea if this is possible, but I can certainly ask.<P>+ Evacs and Abscond:  I will check into the whole thing about these spells clearing or not clearing aggro lists.<P>+ Abscond:  This is another spell that fizzles too frequently.<P>Items:<P>- The Plane of Growth robe:  Honestly, I'm fine with longer casting times on free direct damage spells.  Even more so if it's a Lure.<P>+ Epic Quest:  I'll ask them to review the Cazic skin and the whole difficulty of this quest.  But keep in mind that I am in favor of these quests being very hard.<P>+ Concussion spell scroll:  This is believed to be too hard to obtain.  But, consider that this is a great spell, and having to earn it is a good thing to me.  The question is, is it too hard to get.<P>New Spell Ideas:<P>"BLINK (i.e. proc a defensive shadowstep) <BR>Ok, wizards know stuff and we travel. How about a defensive self-only "Blink" spell that predicts the future (of the combat we're in) and procs a shadowstep when the wizard's about to get hit? I'm not sayin it should work flawlessly, but that kind of spell seems to hit 2 of our supposed class-specific strengths (knowledge of the attack coming, and transportation away from the attack) and helps us be a bit less of a liability in groups. Maybe at high levels it could even have mild hate reduction a-la Concussion. Hell, gimme a whole blink line of defensive spells of varying proc frequency and effectiveness. <BR>This might also address the fact that we got no hp/ac and no pet to help with our defense."<P>This is an interesting spell idea that I'll pass on.  A 'buff' that basically procs shadowstep when the caster is hit.  But only for potential future use, not for any sort of solution to current wizard issues.<P><BR>Wow.  One day dedicated to two threads…  And more to come tomorrow.<P>Thanks for you input.  I will certainly be reading this thread and updating my list.  I may not post because I'll be posting in other threads.  But I will keep reading.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Criticals<P>Give wizards critical strikes!<P>warriors do critical melee dmg occasionly.<P>A wizzard is the master of magical damage and some times thier spells should do  critical damage like 120% to 175% the normall max damage of the spell. it would be pretty few and far between like 1 in 50 that lands extra hard but it would be a verry nice way to up the average damage for wizards  especieally in those epic encounters where the don't feel like they do enough i think they wouldn't feel that way if a couple of the nukes they casted did 150% the normal damage. maybe level 60 wizards could get critical spell damage at 160% max but i think that giving level 20 wizards a chance at a 120% dmg would help, and the % that a critical spell would increes dmg should go up every 5 levels or so by 5%. so at 35 they would get random criticals for up to 135% dmg.<P> Criticals would never do less than max dmg and would have a much better chance to hit high MR mobs.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>These are my ideas for balancing wizards. I'm going to list it out in the following format:<BR>What I don't like<BR>Why I don't like it<BR>What I'd do to fix it<P>Vision Utility Spells<BR>I'm not just talking about the telescopic vision spells. From what I've read, that's been covered. Specifically I'm talking about the spell Magnify (level 29). This is a telescopic vision spell with the added bonus of having Ultravision. The problem is, it has a short duration, and you can't be very effective when your zoom is that high (your rez/FoV drops, you have no way of guaging your distance from your target, and the like).<BR>I'd fix this by removing the telescope part, and increasing the duration of the spell to match that of Heat Sight (our infravision spell). Infravision is pretty useless for finding your way around some places, and there's not always a mage to get a coldstone from nearby. Basically, I'd like an Ultravision spell for us non-Dark Elves.<P>Staff of the Wheel<BR>The rod in Erud's Crossing is way too hard to get. The sharks there can see through every type of invisibility, there's a LOT of them, and they're all (reportedly) in their high 40s - low 50s.<BR>I'd remove a few of the sharks, or make it that they can't see through at least invisibility to animals. Also, when I was doing this, a shark flew out of the water and ate me. I think this was an isolated bug but please look into it (this happened several months ago).<P>Invisibility<BR>This isn't specific to wizards but I think it should be looked at. Invisibility and Invisibility to Undead stack, but effectively cancel each other out (if you have both cast upon you, then EVERYTHING can see you). <BR>Either make it that they don't stack, or make it that they don't cancel each other out. This got me killed when I went after my rod in Guk.<P>Portals<BR>I don't think it's fair that we have to wait until level 39 to get a group teleport to Western Commonlands. Even level 34 would be more appropriate, considering the volume of people that want to get there (the East Commonlands tunnel is more or less the marketplace of Antonica, if not all of Norrath, and people constantly want to go there to peddle their wares, and druids/higher level wizards aren't always available).<BR>I'd like to see the level on this spell be reduced to 29 or 34.<P>Harvest<BR>This is a great spell. I have one problem with it though: because it has a 10 minute recast time, if it's removed from our memorized area, when we rememorize it, it will take 10 minutes before we can use it. This is probably intended but I don't think it's right. This is effectively giving us one less spell slot to work with (those of us who use the spell, at least).<BR>I would fix this in one of two ways: either make it that the recast time doesn't tie into the rememorizing time (probably not feasible), or make it a skill available at level 34 (not unlike Mend, Lay Hands, Harm Touch, and other class specific skills).<P>Gloves<BR>Not specific to wizards in any way. I still wear my Gloves of the Gatecaller for the look, and they weigh 5.5! I'd like to see more black gloves, maybe even with some stats on them.<P>O'Kiels Radiation<BR>Here's what I like about this spell (and its counterpart, O'Kiels Flickering): It increases the SV Fire of the target. Eventually, it also lasts long enough that it's a pretty effective anti-fire buff... provided that you plan on keeping only one person protected. The spell lasts just long enough for the average battle, so by the time you've cast it on everyone in your group, the first person's begins to fade away.<BR>I'd fix this by increasing the duration of the spell and removing the damage component (or leaving it in, since it doesn't really do much at all). <P>Rain spells<BR>These spells aren't widely used probably because the situations for which they would be used effectively are so infrequent (let's leave the pet factor out of this). These spells would be best used on a single creature to the effect of a DoT without kiting. The immobile creature (either kept in place by your tank or rooted) will receive a gradually increasing amount of damage over a time (the 4 hits) while the taunt factor is kept low (the time between the hits helps in this). The thing is, it isn't often that when you're fighting with a tank/group that you'll be taking on one creature at a time, and the continuous hits tend to cause root to break and the target often gets out of the range of the spell before he has been hit to the spell's full effect.<BR>I would fix this in one of the following ways:<BR>increase the number of hits and lower the aggro (so you can hit stuff surrounding the main target without drawing too much attention from the tank)<BR>or<BR>make root have less of a chance of breaking with rains than other spells (probably not feasible, and also probably not appropriate since grouping is being largely encouraged at this point)<BR>or<BR>have rains be a manner of a chain-DD, keeping the damage isolated to the target, so it would work as if the caster cast a small DD 4 times successively (I don't think this is a good idea but I thought I'd throw it in anyway; might be nice for a new line of spells)<P>(I had thought of some other ideas for fixing this but I don't remember them... maybe I'll come back to this one later)<P>Tishan's Kilt<BR>This quest is way to hard considering the reward<BR>I'd either make the quest easier (bad idea) or make the Kilt better (Druids can wear it too, maybe throw some int and wis on it? there's a distinct lack of leg items with int and wis on them)<P>Imbue Fire Opal<BR>I don't think it's appropriate that a level 29 spell be found in the same room as a level 53 dragon<BR>I'd make this spell available in the wizard guild<P>Cazic skin<BR>This item should not drop in the Plane of Hate. The level of player it takes to do the epic quest does not belong in this zone, and the mass of people it takes to get Cazic to spawn and then kill him deprives all the younger players of their fun.<BR>I'd change the item or make it drop somewhere else. The Plane of Growth or Mischief seem appropriate, maybe even Skyshrine or Veeshan's Peak<P><BR>I had a whole bunch of other things that I wanted looked into but I can't remember them. Maybe I'll come back with them later... I think that's enough for now.<P><BR>Thanks a lot for your support!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> I read somewhere that one of the reasons for grouping is that a group can take higher level MOBs at  faster rate. With a wizard its just no point trying to get into a group that is hunting yellows or reds. At lv 22 with maxed skills I get resisted 100% against yellow cons, the only time i can get XP is when a group says "sure join us and sit down out of the way somewhere and dont do anything". I olso play a young druid and cleric, with these classes I almost NEVER get resists. I'm seriously thinking of deleteing the wizard as they are now, they arent worth the frustration.  <P>If I'm EVER to play my wizard again verent will have to work on A)mob resistability, and B)MOB agro when grouped.<P>PS the idea I read earlier about casting a proc on your tanks is IMHO one of the best ideas for a wiz I've ever heard (at least we can do "some" dmg in a fight that way)  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Even GZ who seemed to have a dislike for the class saw that the waves were not hitting enough.  The design is very limiting and limited as is, having it further crippled by capping wave numbers makes it worse.  Making pets take up waves ruins the spell line.<P>Honestly?  The best solution I can think of is to remove the multiple targets from this entirely, and up the damage slightly on most of the spells.  Make them slower blasts, sort of half-dots that do 3 waves on a single target.  If you don't like that, then up the waves that hit, this is covered already earlier.<P>"- Okiel’s Radiation and the other one: Sure, not the greatest spells.
