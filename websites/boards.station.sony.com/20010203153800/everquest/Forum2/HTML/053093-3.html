</FONT><HR>I agree with alot of the points here but would like to add a few more. <P>The former points I think need to be addressed<BR>1)taunt - still isn't good enough<BR>2)berserk - should do more.. maybe a better crit/crip rate or innate haste or improved damage bonus<BR>3)epic - grossly underpowered compared to the other epics.. expecially when you consider how much harder it is to obtain.<BR>4)useless items/skills - disarm, shields, +str gear.. all these things are near useless and need to be looked at.<P>now for my additional points that I haven't seen.<P>1)racial disparity - you guys try and state that the XP penalty that large races are offset by the fact that they are more powerful than small races.  <P>Let's see.. ogres can't be stunned from the front from a normal hit (special attacks and spells can still stun them) and trolls can regenerate.  Both can slam, and both have naturally higher melee stats (which we all know are near useless exept for sta which boosts HP by a decent amount)  <P>Now lets look at the disadvantages to being large.  Ogres and trolls are huge, they block tunnels and get stuck in those same tunnels, they make getting to the mob hard for the smaller races.  I have died literally hundreds of times because I couldn't get past that kobald or froglok in the tight hallway that decided to stand there and attack me while I had one behind me (boxed in by 2 mobs when the elf in the group just jumped over a group of 5) Also, ogres and trolls have a VERY limited selection of classes they can be.. warrior, SK, and shaman.. no other race is so limited.  Next is equipment.. there are alot of VERY nice items.. some being the best in the game at the time you can get them.. that aren't useable by ogres and trolls (imbued granite spaulders, hero bracers, many of the armor sets) but there are no troll and ogre only items that currently equal these items. Faction is also a huge disadvantage for trolls and ogres, the only race with worse faction issues are iksar and I couldn't imagine playing one after being a troll for so long and dealing with the faction issues I had.<P>Now one thing that I notice is that the iksar have nearly all the disadvantages that trolls do, but don't have all the advantages and they get the same XP penalty.  Why is this?? All I can think of is you think that regenerating 4/6/12 hp a tick at the varying levels is worth a 20% penalty.. I think you need to rethink that as regeneration is near useless in most group situations.<P>Some ideas to remedy this include..<BR>1)get rid of the iksar penalty or reduce it to 5-10%<BR>2)give trolls and ogres something unique to make them worth thier XP penalty.. they are a large race why not let them use a 2 handed weapon and a shield?? that way the fatty tanks would have the higher AC and defense but the small tanks would be the high damage high taunters.<BR>3)give the large races some decent large only items like giant armor or if you allow them to use 2 handers in 1 hand then give them some nice troll/ogre 2 handers.. a giant spiked club would be perfect in my opinion  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>that is all my opinions I hope you take a look and do something  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Gurglespit Froggybasher<BR>Troll Warrior<BR>Emarr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This one really goes for all classes but I thought I'd drop it here since I relate it to my warrior  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Using the bandage skill should get a certain chance of curing disease or poison. This should start at a fairly low level and the chances should increase some (but not much) as you level up. Picture this something like 1 in 10 bandages on average also has a cure disease/poison effect. Stronger poisons/diseases therefor need more succesful cures (bandagings?).<P>Why u ask ?<BR>Simple. Warriors (and a lot of other classes) have only a very limited means of regaining hp. Bandaging is one (no chance there), sitting and waiting for natural regen is the other. It is this natural regen that suffers way too much from disease/poison (imagine being level 14 and killing zombies/plagued rats and getting stuck with a disease for well over an hour with no way to cure - that just plain stinks!)<P>Thx  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>51 Gnome Warrior here.<P>Ok, I start this off by saying:<P>When I picked a Gnome I did it because I wanted to be DIFFERENT.  I hate the monotony of Barbarians/Ogres/Trolls -- there's too many of them!  I thought a Gnome Warrior would be funny, which it is.<P>Things I believe should be looked at are, in no particular order  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  In caps , I'm not yelling, but so you see the categories.<P>SMALL RACES CANNOT WEAR TREEWEAVE OR HERO BRACERS:  Uhm... I know we're Gnomes/Halflings/Dorfs and all.  I understand why other warriors are stronger such as Ogres.  But if you won't give us these items... ever thought of giving us more +AGI or +DEX or even HASTE items that are SMALL races only?  AGI and DEX should actually mean something.<P>SHIELD:  Give us a reason to use one.  I have the bash skill at about 50 ... haven't worked on it since I was level 20 or so.<P>CRITICAL HITS/CRIPPLING BLOWS:  Make these more useful.  A critical hit for less than my average damage, whats critical about that?  Someone stated the ability to INCITE Berserker Frenzy as a skill.  This to me seems like an awesome idea.  Give it a recharge rate of 30-60 minutes or so and it could be a very useful thing assuming the damage on crippling blows really meant something, or stunned the mob.<P>2 HANDERS:  Same, give us a reason to use this instead of dual wielding.  I used a Fellhammer for a while (34/46, Smite, warrior only) -- sometimes I did double attacks for *18*.  That's a joke.  At least make us hit for the minimum weapon damage.  This should apply to all 2h weapon classes.<P>LACK OF POST 35 SKILL:  It IS boring.  I have 6 alternate characters now, all started at various times, because after 40 there's absolutely nothing to look forward to until you hit level 51 (not counting the extra 1hp a tick at 50)<P>DISARM:  A useless skill unless in duels.<P>MONOTONY:  I pull sometimes, target, hit 1 for Auto Attack, then... Taunt, Kick, Taunt, Kick, Taunt, Kick.  I don't even wait for them to refresh, I just mash them all the time to keep myself doing something.  My sense heading is 200 because of this.<P>CLASS ARMOR:  Give us more items besides Cobalt/Crafted/Indicolite/Bereserkers?  I am stil in almost full Crafted armor at level 51.  I have Cobalt Boots and Gauntlets because someone who quit gave them to me.<P>WEAPON SPECIALIZATION:  An idea?  Have a better attack rating in a specific weapon skill like 2hs or such.<P>TAUNT: Already been discussed.<P>The bottom line:  I believe Warriors are a good class and when there aren't 10 others looking for a group it's not hard to get in on some action.  But I believe we should get maybe 2 more skills useable WITH Taunt or Slam/Bash/Kick between level 35 and 50.  That's a long boring road there.<P>Perhaps let Kick and Bash/Slam be used together?  I don't care if that allows large races Slam and Kick.  It gives us all more to do.  We like mashing buttons.<P>We don't have nifty spells or neat tricks.  I think besides Taunt we have no PROBLEMS at all, we just want to make the class more fun for us to play.  I don't really care about soloing that much.<P>Heh even though I've killed about 5-6 the past few days last night I got a can of whoopass opened on me by a green Sand Giant in oasis... I felt like a jackass, you have any idea how humiliating it feels to be level 51 and you can't kill a stupid level 35 mob?  That last night makes me want to quit him and start a different character.  No I didn't pick a warrior to solo, nor did I want to.  I attacked the Sand Giant because it was bothering the low level PCs around it.  I like helping people so I figured it was a good idea.  We should be able to be killed by mobs that are this trivial.<P>Anyway, I think that's all I can think of... thanks for reading my suggestions/ranting!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Zenambik Fyrenord - &lt;The Chosen Clan&gt;<BR>51 Gnomish Gemchopper Extraordinaire<BR>*Lanys T'Vyl*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Many of the points made here are the same as mine, but for the record I will state what I think warriors need. <P>- AoE Taunt.<P>- Piercing needs to cap as high as the other weapon skills.<P>- Stat distribution. Make more items with AGIL/DEX for large races to give the same compensation medium/small races get for STR/STAM. <P>- Effects of Stamina and Agility. With the new mobs brought out in Kunark and Velious, not just warriors, but EVERYONE needs stamina to effect HP's more. Agility, same issue, you don't see much of a difference between a 75 agility ogre and a 150 agility halfling.<P>- AC/Attack caps. Are these real? What are they? You have stated stats after 200 have diminishing returns, and they hard cap at 255. Does AC or Attack have a soft cap?<P>- Healing. Bind wounds needs to be increased. After 50, all pure melee classes should be able to get 201 bind wounds. <P>- Bind Points. I know you are against melee's binding all over the place. Put in more bind locations, make special statues or something where melee can bind. (heck, put in NPC's that give quests for people to be bound in certain locations &lt;money sink&gt; )<P>- Graphics for non-velious having people. I saw myself on my friends computer... he doesn't have velious. WHY AM I WEARING STEEL PLATE? That is just dumb. At least make it look like cobalt if someone doesn't have Velious. <P>- EPICS. Risk versus reward. How about mind numbingly boring quest for high levels after its introduction. Chardok part is good, sky part is ok, hate is boring, fear is REALLY boring, and the dragon scales.... why do we share quest components? For how long this quest takes, and the calibre of items needed, these weapons need to be better and have better procs. What procs? Warriors need to taunt. What taunts? Snare, slows, and of course DD. What would I like to see? I want the 2h slash and 1h slash to both have better ratios than ANY weapon a warrior can find, proc or no proc. What procs? I want a DoT + snare on one and life tap or slow on the other. This isn't asking to much, this an epic weapon. There should be nothing better, not even in VP (unless a NEW epic is dicovered there that uses the current....). <P>Lumpy Doo<BR>58 Warrior - Xegony<BR>Inner Circle<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As a warrior, I've sat by and watched all the other melee classes complain about how they are not as good as we are in some respect.  They got increased skills, increased Hit Points, increased mana, more spells, disciplines, etc.  Instead of giving us things that are not really related to our class (new skills) how about something that defines us as warriors.  A warrior is only as good as the equipment he has on him.  So why is it that our weapons are pretty low on the food chain?  Yes, we have the best armor (AC wise) but our weapons need help.  All we have and need are weapons and armor.  You will never see a warrior weapon with a damage/delay close to 1/1 like a monk, or one with a 600 point proc, like a ranger.  Why not?  Supposedly we are supposed to do much less damage than other classes because people feel that we'd replace all other melee types.  Suppose we could do as much damage as a monk.  Ever see a warrior break spawn using feign?  Ever see a warrior drag corpses using hide/sneak?  A major complain of rangers is that they need more armor so that they will stop getting beat on.  Well, instead of beefing up the rangers defense until they can wear cobalt, how about giving us the same opportunities to use their weapons.  If our weapons are always second best there is no way we can taunt monsters and take the hits like we are designed to.  I think of the warrior as a melee combat specialist, why are there so many weapons we cannot use?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Howdy all! I’m not going to start by saying how long I’ve been playing or how many characters I have or how I consider myself to be very smart about all this…. etc, etc, because it’s soooo annoying. As I've read the posts, I've found myself wanting to argue AGAINST many of the changes that have been suggested. I think the game works pretty good as it is. First, I'll get to the point and give the changes that I DO think are good.<P>1) Using a shield should provide a block bonus. Creatures in Velious can block our attacks, why can’t we block theirs? Also, being able to block will alleviate the need to increase AC.<P>2) Bind wound. It DOES work, but the cap should be increased some for warriors. Also, it's not practical to have to carry around two backpacks just for your bandages. Have an item like a "first aid kit". It only takes up one slot, but you can use it to bind wounds. You'd have to have the skill to use it. You'd also have to replenish it with more bandages, or it only has so many "charges", like a splitpaw. But right after a fight where you almost died, you shouldn’t be able to push a couple of buttons and BAM!.. be ready to go.<P>3)I think it’s a good idea to get 5 points every 10 levels that we can use to buff our base attributes. After all, we’re gaining experience… why can’t we grow stronger or smarter? <P>4)At level 40 or 45 add a weapon specialization that gives a good bonus for 1H/2H Slash and Blunt ONLY IF you’ve reached master level in all of them.<P>A lot of other improvements have been mentioned. Some of the other suggestions might sound good on the surface, but they really aren't practical in gameplay. Others are just plain silly. Here are some that stood out, and why I feel they are "less effective."<P>-Area affect taunt. This would be great! However, I think it would make life a little too easy for the casters. Besides, if there are say 12 characters raiding a room, it's not realistic to expect ALL the mobs to say "He's the tank! Get him" No, they're going to go for the little guy hiding behind the tank, that's nuking them for all that damage. <P>-Taunt. Leave it the way it is-- it works! The mob’s attack is based on damage. The reason why mobs don’t listen to taunts is because the casters are hurting them more than the tanks. Casters need to use their spells more effectively. Start nuking after the tanks have done a lot of damage. When the mob goes to the caster, the warrior can taunt and it will work perfectly. Why? Because he’s done more damage. This way, the casters help the tanks keep the baddies off them, instead of rendering their taunts useless by doing too much damage. It doesn’t need tweaking, just a strategy a bit different than the rut most groups have dug themselves into. Before you flame, try it.. it works. <P>-More damage output. A high level warrior can dish out 1200 points of damage. He’s not going to be able to nuke like a wizard, but that’s not his job. Damage output is fine. <P>-Disarm. This also works just fine.  It lowers the damage to mobs that are attacking with a weapon. If they don’t have a weapon, how can you disarm? They’ll do the same amount of damage as before. <P>-Bind points in the game are fine. The whole point to having a zone far away from any binds is to increase the risk involved. You wouldn't be as worried about dying if you could get bound two zones away no matter where you go. <P>-Area affect fear. Some want a  "Battle Cry" type skill that has the same effect as instill doubt. This doesn’t fit a warrior. A warrior is a stand up, toe-to-toe fighter. Rogues use instill fear to get the mob to turn around so they can backstab and get more damage. Warriors can’t backstab, so there’s no point in having the skill. <P>-Track. Warriors don’t need a tracking skill. A tracking skill would be useful, don’t get me wrong.  All the time I hear "How many HP's do you have? You're pulling!" Then I've wandered around unable to find anything, and ended up pulling the first thing I saw. If you could have the HP’s and AC of a warrior, plus tracking, why would anyone ever play a ranger? Some think that warriors should get a scaled down version of the skill. That’s what rangers have, a scaled down version of the druid skill. Sure, it’d be nice…. But we’re talking balance. Tracking for warriors wouldn’t work. If you HAVE to use it, group with a ranger or druid and have him tag along while you pull. <P>-Healing Potions are bad. Some say that they would be used just as a backup or for emergencies. I disagree. Need a heal, find a cleric. You could even pay him for it, and it would be cheaper than an expensive potion. Can't find a healer? Sit down and rest. All potions will do is allow the super rich to solo when normally they'd have to group or die. Need to heal when nobody is around? Bind Wound. Besides, this isn't Diablo II. Everquest is geared more to real life, real time role-playing, not comic arcade style diversion. If your group ditches you because you didn't heal fast enough, well they were a crappy group and you should be glad to be rid of them. If you're tanking for them, any group should be happy to give you heals and/or wait for you to heal on your own. I'm sure the game designers thought about this when they were still in the playtesting phase of development, and they left them out for a reason.  <P>-Increased regeneration. Again, leave it the way it is. If you get beat within an inch of your life, it should take some time to recuperate. Again, we're talking about realistic role-playing and combat... not Diablo II. <P>-Increased HP's. This also is not needed. Of course one warrior is not going to come close to the HP's of a high level mob. Those mobs are meant to be attacked by groups, no soloed. Do you really want to have guys running around that have so many HP's they can solo dragons, or take strolls alone in the planes? Besides, we still have roughly 10% to 15% more HP's than the rest. That's enough.<P>-Racial bonuses. A dwarf or halfling warrior shouldn’t get any extra help so he can keep up with barbs, ogres, and trolls. They shouldn’t get special attacks, either. Large races get bonuses because of their greater size and strength. The fact is that in a fight, bigger is better. A big ogre is going to hit harder than a little halfling. Big races make better warriors, period. Just as an erudite makes a better wizard because his INT is higher. The little guys don't deserve bonuses just to level the field. Deal with it, or sell your swords and take up baking. Giving bonuses to small races would also leave humans and elves out of luck… shouldn’t they get something, too?  The incentive to play a dwarf or halfling warrior is the difficulty. A barb warrior is an easy character to play. If you pick a harder one and do well, it brings more challenge to the game and proves how good you are. <P>-No Bind and no Gate. Don't get me wrong, it would be cool for us to be able to bind ourselves. But, whether by skill or item, this would make us a little too powerful. This is what casters are for. I've never had a problem getting a bind when I needed one. It thought for a while it would be cool to have an item that had an effect the same as Gate. This also defeats the purpose of group play. At high levels, you're going to be in a group. Fight together and die together, and hopefully you'll have an druid near that can cast succor and save the group.  <P>-No more speed. Some have complained that it's too hard for warriors to travel, and that we run too slowly. Again, that's part of the game. If you need to run across Antonica, make preparations. Get invis and SoW, (I've always gotten one when I asked nicely) or find someone to travel with. Learn to AVIOD the mobs that will kill you. Practice by taking a low-level character to Kunark, and run between Firiona Vie and Ill Omen while avoiding Drachnids and Vekis. <P>-Somebody suggested infra and ultra vision for large race warriors. That is just silly. Might as well ask for spells. Or better yet, a rocket launcher! Again, that's what makes the game interesting. When it gets dark, it's harder to see. You have to deal with the world around you and adapt to the conditions. Visibility gets worse when it rains, too. Do players want a Finely Crafted Helm of Weather Control?<P>-Religon. Contrary to what some think, religion DOES affect gameplay. The deity you worship affects faction. It would be impractical to introduce abilities that would allow someone to pray to their god and have him save their butts. Don't rely on god, save your own arse. Also, evil characters are KOS in the Plane of Hate because Innoruk is the prince of hate. Guess what... he HATES everybody, including all those that follow him. What, did you think you could go visit, have some tea and give him a hug? (No, I'm not British.)<P>-More AC. I think the AC for warriors is fine. Just because we are the main tanks, does not mean that we should tower over the rest. Paladins and Rangers can be powerful fighters as well, and we should share the pedestal a bit. <P><BR>Well, that's enough complaining for now. Just like everyone else, I think the class is darn near perfect. Just a tiny bit of tweaking is needed. Some of the “wishes” would be really cool to have, but just aren’t practical. A lot more of the requests are a little out there; they would only serve to make the warrior a super-uber badass that would not fit in the game. It's not about having one class dominate the others; it's about the classes teaming up and each performing a role. Some of the ideas on tweaking the crafted armor are good, but that is more of an item balancing issue, so I did not mention it here. You also didn't hear me complain about the quests, because it's going to be a long time before my warrior will be a high enough level to even care. Sorry for all the typos, and I’ll be keeping an eye on the string for all the flames I’m gonna get! Really, I don’t mean to offend anyone… I just think that each idea should be carefully considered… and I have a Dennis Leary-like sense of humor. Thanks to Verant for hosting these forums, hopefully there are some good ideas in here that will lead to good changes in the game. Luck to you all!<P>Elgamin Legola<BR>23rd Barbarian Warrior<BR>Cazic-Thule<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I know there have been several suggestions for a new taunt, but I wanted to chuck my idea into the ring.  Have a taunt skill that drops you defence by 40pct or so for a few seconds, and has roughly an 80pct chance to succeed in taunting a MOB.  Only useful in extreme situations, but I've found enough places that it would be useful to ask for it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I've been following this thread for a couple of days now, and I'm impressed with the amount of thought all of my fellow warriors are putting into the warrior discussion.  One thing has really struck me about the warrior class that seems to have been almost completely ignored:<P>**********BESERKER  FRENZY*******************<P>For a class-defining skill, this is one is pretty lame.  I don't know anyone who is impressed by it.  I think the reason that it has gotten so little attention is because we have practically forgotten that it's there.<P>I think that Beserker Frenzy needs to be changed significantly.  I believe that it should not be an 'automatic' skill (like every other warrior skill, sadly) but should instead be much more like LoH and Harm Touch.  It should be on a BUTTON  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/eek.gif"> and should improve with time.  Because it is a fatiguing exertion, it should have a one use per Norrath day recycle time (like LoH or HT), and it should be a show stopper.  It should be impressive.  It should increase ATK, AC, Damage, and even Haste.  It should be the save-you-skin / save-the-whole-party / save-the-day / turn-the-tide type of move that it was meant to be.  <P>Right now it gives +10 str, and the ability to land crippling blows (which no one seems very impressed with, according to the above posts).  It was like this at level 1, and its like this now, at level 51, and it will be like this at 60.  Ho hum.  <P>My suggestion is that we should lose beserker frenzy as we have it now (it's Lame-O), and get a much improved, far more impressive version, on a button.<P>If you like this idea, my fellow warriors, mention it below.  I think this is a critical area for us that has been, thus far, overlooked.  <P>Ugglie Bogmonster<BR>Quellious </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Ok already posted on the first thread of things in general (basicly things that affect all melee classes)  This is my warrior specific gripes/groans/moans/complaints.<P>First off, we are supposed to be the masters of melee.  Taking and giving.  This isnt really whats happening, and we give up ALOT for this.  We have no handy invis spells/skills, no feign death, no root, no healing, no SoW, no DoT's, no snares, nothing other than our fighting ability.  So why in Verants name arent we supreme in this field?<P>A bit of general items:<BR>Warriors should have the widest range of weapons and armors.  We should have the most control of how our weapons/armor affects us.  We should be equivilant and best in any type of attack (using a weapon) so if I want to blunt, or pierce or slash (2handed) or slice and dice (1handslash)  it should be realitivly easy to change.  Im not saying flood the market, Im just saying you need a bit more and place them on creatures that a group with us can attain.<P>A bit more specific:<P>Taunt--Not nearly sufficient.  It needs to be much more.  We are supposed to be brick walls but half the time I cant keep my enemies attention.<P>Regeneration--Casters get meditation, increased meditation (35 I think) and specialization.  This is the way you keep them regeneration in proportion to their level.  Why in the world do we not have an equivalant?  Our HP is all we have and we regenerate at the same rate at level 10 as we do at level 50.  Even the bonus after fifty isnt sufficient.  I am only level 41, but I know that the increase wont be enough (once I get more hp).  At level 41 I got the crap beat out of me in Velious trying to get back to the mainland (big surprise).  I was beat within an inch of my life.  The time that it took me to regenerate was 31 minutes.  31 MINUTES!!!!  That is absolutly pathetic because I had no buffs, this was just my average every day hp.  A caster can be OOM and get back all their mana in 12 minutes at my level.  (and thats without clarity, with clarity or hp-&gt;mana spells they can get full in 6-8 minutes).  We need a skill which helps us to regenerate our hp at a percentage of our hp.  We should be able to sit and regenerate our full hp in about 12 minutes, same as casters.<P>AC--I heard that it has a soft cap of 1100.  I dont know if its true or not, but Im at 850 at 41 with no twinkage (warrior is my highest char).  Basicly Im wearing crap compared to others my level.  I cant imagine how the uber gear we get in the planes will help our AC much if we can reach the soft cap without it.  Also, our skin should become use to the abuse that we put through it.  We should get a skill that reduces the damage we recieve by a percenage that raises with our level.  This would solve the AC problem by giving us more damage taking ability without changing our cap.  We need a skill around fourty.  At that level have it absorb perhaps 5 percent of the damage that would have been dealt to us.  By sixty it should absorb around 20.<P>Looks--I have a troll warrior.  He has looked the same since the day he was born as he does today (nekked of course).  Perhaps you could impliment some sort of change to our looks.  One at level 40 that makes us look a little stronger and less like humpty dumpty.  Im sure I have built up my muscle tone.  Also at level 50 give us to option to add scars.  Like /surname only instead it would be /scaredapperance.  it would promt you with "Would you like to allow your scars to be viewed by others?"  If you accpet it would perminatnly change your nekked apperance to show scars on your body.  I know its not class balance, but you have to admit it would be kewl.<P>Melee damage--First off all melee miss their apponent to much.  Its really sad that at my level I havent learned to aim my weapon with more effiency.  (Ive gotten worse!)  Ok now for something that has annoyed me since day one.  When an NPC turns their back and runs, I should be able to hit them much easier.  They are hurt, scared, fleeing for their life, and throwing caution to the wind.  So why is it that I hit them LESS when their back is turned?  Two days ago I had nine misses in a row against a blue creature who was fleeing. NINE!  When their back is turned I should hit them every time.  They cannot dodge/parry/repost or even pay attention to me since their back is turned.<P>Caster NPC--They have to much AC and they hit us tanks way to hard.  Its not bad enough that we have to take the blunt of their spells (or allow them to kill our group)  we also have to suffer through a caster npc damaging melee more than us.  ITs very hard on our self esteem.<P>Hope my input helps!<P>Abbrrach Stonebitter, <BR>Green moon of Cazic Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Elhuero<BR> I think the comment regarding the splitpaw covered your lvl and length in game at least with your warrior char.<P>"-Taunt. Leave it the way it is-- it works! The mob’s attack is based on damage. The reason why mobs don’t listen to taunts is because the casters are hurting them more than the tanks. Casters need to use their spells more effectively.

You'll learn post 40 taunt is pretty useless.<BR>2. When the mob is bashing the tank silly for 120+ with double and triple hits you don't want to wait five minutes for the tank to do a bunch of dmg before the casters start nuking. Your plan may work on the Gnolls in sk but it won't work later in life.<P>"-More damage output. A high level warrior can dish out 1200 points of damage. He’s not going to be able to nuke like a wizard, but that’s not his job. Damage output is fine. " <P>Heh um ok I love it when My 26dmg weapon connects for 12dmg (with my str buffed to 180+)<P>"-Disarm. This also works just fine. It lowers the damage to mobs that are attacking with a weapon. If they don’t have a weapon, how can you disarm? They’ll do the same amount of damage as before."<P>If the mob continues to do the same dmg as it did before you disarmed it what was the point? You had an extra button to mash?<P>"-Bind points in the game are fine. The whole point to having a zone far away from any binds is to increase the risk involved.

Warriors can’t backstab, so there’s no point in having the skill."<P>Um we're warriors with BIG bloody weapons and scarred all to hell from past beatings, we should be more intimidationg then some tiny rogue with a toothpick or a buff stud in silk using bare fists. (Not bashing rogues or monks in anyway here. Just making a point which of the three gonna scare you more?)<P>"-Track. Warriors don’t need a tracking skill.

Damn but I would love to have it and i've spent hours trying to legitimize it for my class but still can't even justify it to myself let alone others. PS Druids have the stripped down verison, not rangers.<P>"-Healing Potions are bad. Some say that they would be used just as a backup or for emergencies. I disagree. Need a heal, find a cleric.

Get halfway thru iceclad and a direwolf aggros on me now because I couldn't bw past 50% or use an intelligent healing potion/device (best one I've seen did 30hp woohoo not even 1 hit from a med mob<BR>, even funnier were the silk things dropped in kaesora i used one to heal myself once 10hp ...no joke 10 =P) Now I get to waste all this time on cr yay fun another fun night. Oh Wait I can use your idea and bug a cleric/druid/shammy (who are already annoyed to hell by people asking for buffs) if they can please heal me, and if I get lucky enough to find one that is willing to use a wad of his mana on a non group member now i have to go to him for the heal (or be ultra rude and ask him come to me) at which point I get aggro'd again and either train their group or die. Hmmm I think i prefer buying a decent heal potion and using the same as sow potions...in emergencies.<P>"-Increased HP's. This also is not needed.

Our job is to get beat on, the cleric shouldn't have to cast 3-4 Cheals on the tank engaging an even con mob.<P>"(No, I'm not British.)"<P>Ummm judging by the arse comment above this I'd say Yes you are.<P>"-More AC. I think the AC for warriors is fine. Just because we are the main tanks, does not mean that we should tower over the rest. Paladins and Rangers can be powerful fighters as well, and we should share the pedestal a bit."<P>Umm they have spells?<P>I'm not flaming you here, just trying to show you where I think you are wrong. You are a lvl 23 war and I am 47 I think I've got a little bit more exp to warrior issues at higher lvls just as the 50+ crowd has even more on me. Think about the fact that you are trying to tell people who have months of playing time on you that they are wrong.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

This would provide a warrior with at least a chance of escape (there is still the danger of a mob that runs as fast as sow or faster) and shouldnt tread on the toes of shammies and druids, as its duration wont be long enough to be useful in any other situation than to make a desperate escape, if desired, make it similar to scale of wolf, where if the warrior attacks, it removes the speed without restting the discipline. this would balance warriors with all other classes in regards to survival rates when travelling alone.<P>Aldin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree that 41-51 is the long dry spell for warriors. No new skills, no new skill caps. Basicly you spend all 10 levels maxing skills and improving equipment... It would be nice if there was something to look forward to that wasn't unbalancing. Obviously warriors are already the most sought after tanks, so dramatic changes to damage output or ability to sustain damage would create major tuning issues.<P>Just give us something fun... Instill doubt, safefall, something like that.<P>Probably the two things I think are most broken in the 50+ game are taunt, and the lack of decent AC poison/disease resist gear (compared to magic/cold/fire). Granted these resists are the warrior's achille's heel, but a few more decent items out there would be nice.<P>My question on high level taunting... are the MOBs that much different at those levels, or is it the traveling companions ability to jump up the hate list that has changed? Obviously the MOBs are tuned so that it IS difficult to get their attention and allow the high damage classes to do their job efficiently. Make taunt work 100% and others can blast away indiscriminantly.<P>If your gonna give us an improved taunt, something like a disc would make sense... where it can be used in selective situations to save the day. I don't think warriors should be the only ones to get it though, all taunt capable classes should. /disc taunt, taunts now bump you an extra x points up the hate list when they land. Give it out at 45th.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>The AoE taunt is also an intersting idea but would make a strong class stronger. Possibly you could give this out as a new skill which is an alternative to taunt... call it Mock. Make it less effective than normal taunt, but have an area of effect. This would add some much needed strategy to the warrior's use of the taunt button, without making all the other hybrids obsolete.<P>Other ideas:<P>Let taunt do something even if you are already being attacked, i.e. move you further up the hate list.<P>Make a taunt that is a substitute for attacking and EXTREMELY effective. Basicly you quit swinging and go full time taunt.<P>All just a wishlist really, warriors are already a cruical part of high level encounters... which helps relieve the envy when we see others soloing for xp and farming good loot.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As mentioned by many, warriors seem in many cases to be balanced with other classes, it seems like the balancing assumes a fully equipped warrior, and deals only with the combat aspects of the game.  There are several things wrong with this.<P>1) Most warriors, the ones who have worked their way up non-twinked from level 1, usually never come close to what Verant seems to consider properly equipped for that person's level.  The few properly equipped warriors you see, especially at high levels, are those that are members of uber guilds, or else ones are playing the warrior as a twink, and are camping or buying the items with their main caster character.  And without their equipment, warriors are nothing.  A high level warrior (and other melees) whose corpse has decayed might want to consider starting a new character.  A high level caster whose corpse has decayed still has their spellbook and the capability of buying the relatively inexpensive equipment that they might consider vital for their class.<P>2) There's more to the game than combat.  There are trade skills, places to explore, quests to do, etc.  Unfortunately, warriors probably rank dead last at trade skills.  I mastered tailoring with my barbarian warrior when camping got boring.  It took me a month of solid effort.  A caster friend who took up tailoring once complained that he only had 7 skill improves in the last hour.  That would have been a good day or two's work for me.  I have found that gnome necros apparently have a much greater aptitude for smithing that dwarven warriors, or swimming than a barbarian warrior, who cannot even leave his home city without swimming a lake.<P>The sad fact is that, outside of combat, my warrior has no use.  No way to earn money through trade skills, or sell services such as spells.  I think that warriors either need some utility outside of combat, or their abilities in combat should be adjusted to compensate.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Another point is that in the epic encounters in velious, many things.. (tormax, vindicator, some things in POG) seem to be designed to do FAR TOO MUCH DAMAGE in a short period of time.<P>I have 5k hp.  I have 1200 ac buffed.  I die in about 10 seconds vs these mobs.  It is my belief that you should review the mobs that were apparantly designed with the Donal's BP in mind, and tone them down... even if that item is to stay in game.<P>Since our damage is far below that of monk and rogue and ranger, we have no spells, we cannot have it taunted off of us by other classes (taunt doesnt work on boss type mobs... boggle) its simply our turn to die when they go balistic on you.<P>Also, I'm not sure if anyone has mentioned taunt yet.<P>=P</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sorry Lyenea, but I wasn't talking about twinks. Plain and simple.<P>Warriors tank and melee better then hybrids. This isn't based off of a gut feeling or a single group encounter. This is based off of many parsed logs of equally equiped warriors and hybrids. This gap widens post fifty.<P>It really bugs me that a person can complain about there class without knowing the facts. The game totally changes post 50. As stated before, hybrids and warriors pre-50 are closer together in the melee/tank area. This changes post 50. I'm sorry that the wait from 1 to 50 is a long one, but its one that will pay off in the end. VI already stated that hybrids will not take the place of a warrior, and considering hybrids only do 50-60% of a warrior(post 50) that speaks for it self.<P> I see all this from a paladins point of view as I have had to give up that class to play a warrior. But when I see someone post that they should nerf hybrids so they don't come close to the same HP or melee, it really pisses my off. Its like the rich kid crying because he doesn't have what the poor kids got.<P> As far as the rest of the suggestions..I like them. I love being a warrior now and think, besides a few issues, all we need is some more flavor. After all, most spells are flavor for hybrids. Oh yeah and as for hybrids(well mosty pallys) healing is a down time thing for the fact that when they get it - it's no longer of value to the group, ie Cleric is aboard now.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Not just taunt port 50, but taunt during the whole journey.<P>Warrior taunt should be as effective as any spell that a hybrid can cast on the mob, as effective as the best rogue backstab, as effective as the fastest monk at getting the mobs attention.<P>Also, upon a succesfull taunt.  All other players aggros are cleared (or significantly lowered) from the mob but the warrior's remains.  This will help with the "nano-taunt", ie, the mob is pounding the ranger, the warrior is finally successful with taunt, the mob hits the warrior once and goes back to pounding the ranger.<P>OR...<P>Upon a successful taunt, the mob will stay on the warrior for a guaranteed, set amount of time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Great posts so far.  My ideas.<P>- Add a "take a nap" skill that lets warriors lay down, shut their eyes, and get triple (or more) HP regeneration back.<P>- Charge skill.  That initial hit when two opponents charge at each other should be huge.<P>- Tuant vs 2H weapon.  Modify how taunt works at higher levels so that the memory time duration for damage is slightly longer.  This would allow 2H weapons to be effective at dealing damage and taunting.<P>- When a mob turns his back on me and goes for a caster, that mob should pay a price. Could be it gets hit more often or for more damage, or could be that I can get a special attack such as jump on it to at least slow it down.<P>- Hate to get caught with only one "good" weapon skill, but in reality a specialization in one weapon skill makes sense.  A warrior is skilled in all weapons, but give him a (insert favorite weapon skill type weapon) and watch out.<P>- Really like AoE taunt idea.<P>- Need to keep from homogenizing the "tank" class by giving hybrids the ability levels of Warriors.  No Spells makes Warriors give up so much already.<P>Sammy Level 45 Ogre Warrior - Eci</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ARCHERY<P>1) Damage.  Using the best bow that can be crafted in game, and the best arrows that can be crafted in game, you can hit a spiderling for 27dmg non crit maximum, or Lady Vox for 27dmg non crit maximum.  Sure, it's deadly to spiderlings, but for mobs 30+ that damage is an insult.  Please at LEAST compute ranged damage like melee weapon damage.  (Advertised damage X 2) + 1 and add strength bonus.  Would it really be imbalancing for my warrior of 37 seasons, archery skill of 170+ to hit a mob for 50dmg with an arrow non crit?<P>**Not asking for trueshot or rangers dbl damage attacks - just that archery be lethal and not a joke.  Had I known what archery was when I started, I never would have wasted my time and platinum.<P>2) Trajectory:  This goes for all ranged weapons & magician bolt type spells.  Please allow a certain degree of up/down aiming!  Mobs can hit you through walls, they have no elevation limits (you can levitate to the top of the statue on OT zone and a knight on the ground is hitting you just fine).  Since there are no longer any way a PC can crawl/levitate up somewhere and shoot mobs from afar and stay out of reach, this change is long over-due.  A 30 degree targeting incline/decline with archery, throwing knives, throwing boulders and bolt type spells is requested.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><P><BR>1. Bind wound skill-The cap for warriors pre-50 is an unacceptable 100. That is absolutely way to low, and much lower than other classes too. By the time that you can cap this skill, it almost becomes useless because of the low healing it does, and the time it takes to get a significant amount of HP back. Also being limited to only 50% is overly restricting. I realize that other classes (except monks) are also limited to binding up to 50% but I believe that the amount of damage warriors take warrants a higher skill.<P>2. Skills-There are no new skills gained from lvl35 to lvl50! That is 15 levels, I think that is way to much. Warriors have almost no skills specific to their class. Warriors really need a new skill. I liked the idea of an AE melee attack, or a way of being able to hit more than one target at a time. I think this would be very good for the class. I understand you would have to lessen the damage output to do this without unbalancing them but please to not make it so much that the skill becomes useless unless in rare occasions. Also, warriors need another melee attack that does not require a shield besides kick. No respectable warrior will loose the damage output of another weapon just to carry a shield and back. Something along the lines of one a monks basic attacks. It does not have to be a very powerful one, but just another one would be a considerable improvement. It would also alleviate some of the monotony of pressing attack, taunt, kick, taunt, kick taunt… Adding instill doubt to the warriors arsenal would be the best thing I can think of.<P>3. The warriors post 50 disciplines are not comparable to monks or rogues. Almost every single warrior discipline has a con to go with its bonus, yet they still are not compensated for by any means such as decreasing the waiting time for it to re-pop. The monks and rogues skills are incredibly powerful, but do not come with a disadvantage, what gives?<P>4. Race experience penalty- I realize that small races have a small bonus experience wise over large races but it is not enough to compensate for their lack of skills and stats. There should be at least a measurable bonus that the small races should receive. As a Wood Elf warrior my self, I would absolutely love being immune to stuns from the front like ogres. This is the most annoying this that happens to me in the game besides dieing. Getting stunned absolutely drives me crazy. Also, small races are lacking in there melee skill points, that are not made up for in any means especially by their evasiveness. Some defensive activatible skill would be nice.<P>5. Soloing-Warriors cant solo, period. I know they are not supposed to because they are a staple grouping class but that doesn’t matter when you are LFG for an hour. Usually it does not take this long but when it does, it sucks. Some people have limited time that they can play, and if they can not play during that time, they don’t get to play. Your first reaction to this is say, “play another class that suits you, and your time constraints”. That I do not believe is a valid response because someone should not be prevented from playing their preferred class just because they cannot get a group.<P>6. Binding and transportation- There are no where enough places for melee classes to bind at. This makes traveling much harder and corpse recovery even worse.  There should be a bind spot no more than 2 zones away from every zone. You don’t have to make a city but something has to be done. Even when you have a place to bind at, now you have to beg other places to bind you, which will sometimes take you a while to find a willing caster. Self-binding is the solution. Not just in cities, but every where that casters can. Why shouldn’t they be able to do this? Almost all other classes agree that is the warriors, or melee classes worst aspect of all. Take a poll and I bet you there will be an overwhelming majority favoring self-binding for melee classes. It has been said that melee binding is a closed issue. Think again, its still out there and ignoring it will not do any good. Now to transportation. There are not enough teleport rings/spires/platforms in Norrath. Traveling takes way to long, even when you can get a TP, there should at least be a TP spot near where you are going. This effects all classes, not just warriors. Finding a teleport is hard enough, you should have to spend 30 minutes getting to your destination after getting a TP. I think the BEST way possable to fix this without over powering is to make a quest, easier than JBoots, that grants an item which casts scale of wolth, maybe even a faster version.This would be great because it would not replace the SOW becasue you cant use it in battle, but it will make travelling faster. What would be the problem of this?<P>7. Taunts- With new mobs it has become increasingly harder to taunt mobs, and once they are taunted, unless you get a high critical hit to et you on top of the hate list, the mob goes after some caster or healer. Taunt needs to be more effective. Try setting a minimum time the mob can be on you after a successful taunt.<P>8. Skill development- Between lvls 42 and 51, the skill cap does not raise for any abilities, this makes it a little boring.<P>9. Epic reward-The epic reward is a downgrade to combonations previously present in the game and MUCH easier to obtain. Also, there needs to be a more annoying (to the mob) proc of the weapons, and a lower delay so that you can keep the mob on you. Other combos are much better at this, what is that I just said, oh ya “other combos are better at this”. Can you believe that? The epic reward is a downgrade from non epic weapons. Every other class (pardon necros, and shamans) gets a HUGE bonus by having their epics, but not warriors. Also increase the drop rates on the blades, they are way to rare.<P>10. Cobalt-Cobalt armor is way to rare. They are by far the rarest of the kunark armors, and the bracers are are so rare, the BP drops more than they do.<P>11. Piercing should be caped at 250 not 240, just doesn’t make sense not to.<P>12. HP- Warriors need more hp if we are going to be considered the main tanks. Warriors even with great gear have only a few hundred more hp than high-brids.<P>13. HP regeneration-Casters get mana back 2 times as fast as we get hp, warriors should get a it of a natural regen faster than what is current. <P>14 Graphics-Why do you keep putting crappy graphics on really really good items? Treeweave is the best pre-planes BP for warriors, but it looks terrible. Also the graphics for helms on Wood Elf warriors is pretty bad. It doesn’t nearly as good as other races. Please make a new graphic altogether. That little “crest” thing above my for head is just plain stupid. If you don’t make a new graphi, just make an option to turn off that thing showing up.<P>15. We need a way to escape when the rest of the group fails.After all, the warrior is almost always the last class to run, and last to die, lets try taking that "die" part off there. I like the idea of an easier JBoots quest but i cna tell the answer to that is no.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Pardon me if I am re-posting, but I can not see my post anywhere even if i refresh 5 times.<P><BR>1. Bind wound skill-The cap for warriors pre-50 is an unacceptable 100. That is absolutely way to low, and much lower than other classes too. By the time that you can cap this skill, it almost becomes useless because of the low healing it does, and the time it takes to get a significant amount of HP back. Also being limited to only 50% is overly restricting. I realize that other classes (except monks) are also limited to binding up to 50% but I believe that the amount of damage warriors take warrants a higher skill.<P>2. Skills-There are no new skills gained from lvl35 to lvl50! That is 15 levels, I think that is way to much. Warriors have almost no skills specific to their class. Warriors really need a new skill. I liked the idea of an AE melee attack, or a way of being able to hit more than one target at a time. I think this would be very good for the class. I understand you would have to lessen the damage output to do this without unbalancing them but please to not make it so much that the skill becomes useless unless in rare occasions. Also, warriors need another melee attack that does not require a shield besides kick. No respectable warrior will loose the damage output of another weapon just to carry a shield and back. Something along the lines of one a monks basic attacks. It does not have to be a very powerful one, but just another one would be a considerable improvement. It would also alleviate some of the monotony of pressing attack, taunt, kick, taunt, kick taunt… Adding instill doubt to the warriors arsenal would be the best thing I can think of.<P>3. The warriors post 50 disciplines are not comparable to monks or rogues. Almost every single warrior discipline has a con to go with its bonus, yet they still are not compensated for by any means such as decreasing the waiting time for it to re-pop. The monks and rogues skills are incredibly powerful, but do not come with a disadvantage, what gives?<P>4. Race experience penalty- I realize that small races have a small bonus experience wise over large races but it is not enough to compensate for their lack of skills and stats. There should be at least a measurable bonus that the small races should receive. As a Wood Elf warrior my self, I would absolutely love being immune to stuns from the front like ogres. This is the most annoying this that happens to me in the game besides dieing. Getting stunned absolutely drives me crazy. Also, small races are lacking in there melee skill points, that are not made up for in any means especially by their evasiveness. Some defensive activatible skill would be nice.<P>5. Soloing-Warriors cant solo, period. I know they are not supposed to because they are a staple grouping class but that doesn’t matter when you are LFG for an hour. Usually it does not take this long but when it does, it sucks. Some people have limited time that they can play, and if they can not play during that time, they don’t get to play. Your first reaction to this is say, “play another class that suits you, and your time constraints”. That I do not believe is a valid response because someone should not be prevented from playing their preferred class just because they cannot get a group.<P>6. Binding and transportation- There are no where enough places for melee classes to bind at. This makes traveling much harder and corpse recovery even worse.  There should be a bind spot no more than 2 zones away from every zone. You don’t have to make a city but something has to be done. Even when you have a place to bind at, now you have to beg other places to bind you, which will sometimes take you a while to find a willing caster. Self-binding is the solution.

</FONT><HR>my thoughts<P>1) ya you guessed it taunt. <BR>it is just plain not effective on high level mobs. I am a 60 warrior and mobs such as those in PoG (protectors, sprites, forest spirits lvl 60 or so) can not be taunted effectively. Casters do not even need to cast on these mobs to get aggro and i can not taunt off of them. and god forbit they cast on the mob or on the player its aggroed on.<P>2) offensive disciplines<BR>These last too short and require a very long time to recycle (around an hour). the ones that stand out are furious and mightystrike. lengthen time to 15 seconds at least and cut recycle time in half. the fellstrike discipline does not work as i am told it should. it is suposed to do at least 4x normal damage. rarely do i notice damage more than normal using this. precise discipline does not seem to increase damage output either. the only real usefull discipline is defensive. it last a decent time and does help cut down damage taken, but with the introduction of mega hp mobs in SoV, the discipline runs out halfway through the fight.<P>3) warrior epic<BR>I have been trying to decide if i should complete this or not. i would most likely complete this only to say i have it. much better weapon drop off mobs than the reward on this quest. one such weapon that is better is the willsapper, for 1 hand. has a higher damage output (which helps taunt) and a proc (which helps taunt). the 1 hand quest swords are far too slow lower delay to 20. the 2 hand seems nice, but no warrior uses 2h since you can do so much more damage with duel weild and 1 hand slash. and for an epic weapon the damage is too low, increase the damage on the weapon to 40 (equal with the sk weapon). now procs are a nice effect but as a warrior i want to take a 2h weapon and see some massive hits. what i suggest instead of a normal proc with a dd and stun like the sword currently has. change it to a proc of sorts that would just provide a huge hit say in the range of 2-3 times a good critical hit with a 40 damage weapon. and provide a stun of random duration that goes along with it. saying the swords has stats and resists is no reason to use a weapon.<P>4) Armor<BR>warrior armor (indo, cobalt, Beserker) is far to rare. I am playing on TP and we have done numerous (20 -30) raids into the planes. while tons of hybrid armor drops and rots and caster and hybrids working on having all three sets (norrath, kunark,sov) completed. we have got a single warrior bp in any trip. no warrior on the server has a complete set of plane armor period.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Posting this for a friend who can't seem to post at the moment:<P>Greeting Absor and fellow warriors, <BR> <BR>    Now I know some may or may not agree with what I have to say, but I feel these need to be<BR>looked into in the warrior class.<BR> <BR>Taunt:  Yes this again.  I think we all agree this needs to be improved post 50.  I have to use taunt +<BR>disarm just to make a mob turn on me, but the next round of combat it will jump on someone else. <BR>My role is it to take damage for the group, how can I if I can't get it to hit me.<BR> <BR>Disciplines :  I don't see much to wrong with the Disciplines.  They are not there to help us solo<BR>better.  We will never solo, it is not part of our class.  They are there to give a last bit of help to the<BR>group.  The high damage doing Disciplines last for a short amount of time (Ex: to finish a mob off),<BR>not to last the duration of the fight.  And the evasive, defensive line last long due to the fact that they<BR>are not increasing the damage delt from a warrior in a fast time period.  But decreasing the damage<BR>a mob does a warrior in a long period of time.  One is like a DD short and fast, and the other is like a<BR>DoT long and effective.  The only problem I see with Disciplines is when a warrior dies right after<BR>using a Disciplines, why does the time not reset?  When a paladin/SK dies, thier<BR>layhands/harmtouch comes back.  Why must I continue to wait another 30 mins to use a Disciplines<BR>after I have died?<BR> <BR>Armor/weapons:  Yes armor/weapons do make the warrior.  And there is a bunch of a good armor<BR>out there.  One person said that people compare casters to melee.  Saying a caster will recieve his<BR>spells at 39, a warrior will not recieve new armor/weapons at 39.  And that a 60 fully cobolt warrior<BR>does balance a 60 caster.  But how many caster do you know that own all thier 51-60 spells?  I don't<BR>think so many.  and not all warriors own full cobolt.  Yes there may be more spell than cobolt but I<BR>think this is balanaced out.  Armor and weapons will come with time.  I did see something I<BR>liked, making race weapon/armor quest.  I think this would be a great idea, give the quest back in<BR>everquest.<BR> <BR>Skills: 35 -50, please add something.  That was my most boring time with a warrior, due to nothing<BR>new.  Before Kunark I feared that it would be this way forever.<BR>    disarm = the only reason I still have this hotkey up is due to the little taunt factor it adds, and for<BR>dueling.  Other than that a lvl 50 mobs hits just as hard with or without a weapon.<BR>    Crit = simply eye candy, either a) increase how often we land these or b) increase the damage<BR>done by them.<BR>    Crip = see above.<BR> <BR>Stun:  Being a smaller race, you don't pay for the experince penitly, but you don't get stun (w/o a<BR>shield) until lvl 55.  I think this is a little to high.  Maybe here we can add that skill between 30-50. <BR>Say 45 you can start stuning with kick, just a thought.<BR> <BR>Bind wound:  100% bind is out of hand.  I think if we could get a 70% bind wound after the bind<BR>wound skill of say.. 150 would do just fine.  No need to bind wound to 100%.  when I do use bind<BR>wound, I only bind to a safe amount of health(usally 2 bubbles) and go on my way.<BR> <BR>Hit points:  I do agree we need more HP.  Not nerf hybrids, nor more AC.  More HP = more damage<BR>can be taken(if we can taunt it) = our role in the group increases.

</FONT><HR>The Berzerker Frenzy has been a disappointment for me since it's implementation over a year ago. I propose that the Berzerker Frenzy allow the warrior increasingly greater frequency of crip blows as his/her hp gets closer and closer to zero.  In other words, as the warrior loses more and more hp past the line of Frenzy, crip blows become more and more common.<P>As for the epic issue, I think it would be a good idea to leave the difficulty and rarity of obtaining this item as is.  However, the warrior epic is very arguably underpowered in relation to the shadowknight/ranger/rogue epics.  Scabbards for two handed swords are classically worn on the back.  Why not make the scabbard wearable in the back slot with a haste effect marginally better than the cof and put 20-25 points of AC on the thing?  This could be seen as an interim reward during the course of completing the quest, although I dont know of many warriors who would want to complete the scabbard first.  Given the argument that there are better weapons than the jagged blades of war available in Velious and possibly even Old Sebilis, completing the epic quest would still yield a very highly powered "cloak" that a warrior could keep using in the event that he/she acquired weapons of greater power. <P>On a side note, Dark Elf warriors are small AND are killed on sight most places.  Therefore, the whole "small races sacrifice racial slam for the convenience of small size and good faction" arguement doesn't really work from the standpoint of a Dark Elf.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Basic Summary from what i have seen<BR>1) Taunt. I currently use a sebillite croaking dirk 10/18 weapon in main hand and Defiance 9/19 in offhand and i still can't taunt off rangers and monks at all sometimes its hard even with a rogue if they have ragebringer.<P>2) Aoe taunt nice idea, warcry seems really nice to agro all the mobs around on you to keep it from beating on enchanter.<P>3) Hero Taunt saw this in another post thought it was a good idea a taunt to save a groupmate at near death<P>4) Epic Weapon. Problem: Maestro hand, spiroc blade, and queens blade way to rare. Dmg Dly on primary hand 1hs weapon to high can do more damage and produce a better taunt with weapons i currently use plus new weapons like willsapper and others are better than it. Would like to see a 13/20 or 11/18 1hs with 40 percent haste effect like the ranger, rogue, and monk epics.<P>5) Cobalt drops on helm and bracer. Compared to the other class armors way to low and is more rare than bps/legs on the servers. Would like to see a increased drop rate.<P>6) More ac and hps plus higher inate magic resistance with each level. Seeing casters get higher mr with the normal gear they wear. Monks come close to my ac and other classes are coming fairly close to our hps. Would like to see a small upgrade in the natural hps and ac. <P>7) My own personal gripe. The warrior quest sky belt. Nice stats but ac is atrocious. The druid quest belt has higher ac than it. Why do we go from our random drop ac 10 belt to a ac 5 belt? Its the same ac as the monk one and less than rogues. I suggest bringing it back up to 10 ac with the paladin one and move the sk one from 9 to 10 also.<P>Davan Dragonsbane<BR>60th Warlord of Scions of Phoenix<BR>Anyorea Ro(or however its spelled, shrug im a warrior)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hope your reading this far down absor, but here goes.<P>Warriors are pretty much fine as a class. We cant solo worth anything, we rock in groups, and are the best at takeing damage. We dont need any major re-balanceing, just a few minor tweaks.<P>1)Our peircing skill caps at 240. All of our other weapon skills cap at 250. There are a number of sweet warrior usable peircers in the game, including some that are warrior only, so it doesnt seem that you are trying to discourage warriors from using peircing. Much like monks hth capped lower than their weapon skills, this was probably an oversite.<P>2)Drop rate on cobalt bracers and helm. These are much too rare, compared with other classes. As an example, on veeshan, a deepwater helm sells for about 2k. Ive seen about 20 or 30 of them for sale. In that time, ive seen 1 warrior helm for sale, and it was listed as offers only.<P>3)Im not high enough to worry about the epic yet, but if the people who have them say the main hand one needs to be faster to taunt, I would belive them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree with taunt but that isnt what concerns me. What mainly concerns me i melle skills and our epic weapon. <P>First attack im only 55 but i truely think if we are to be called warriors instead of sheild-bearers NO OTHER class should come close to us in melle abilty. Why after 55 levels do i still miss more then i hit? Can we increase war melle skill cap WITHOUT raiseing the other tank classes to macth. Had i known what i know now when i first started playing i would of made a rogue who can come close in Damage output for mellers? <P>Second is our epic weapon 14/24 is this epic??? I know 3 people with their epics and i feel sad when i see them useing VP weapons over their epics. Sure they have stats and saves but what does that mean to some 1 who all rdy has 202str 198sta 148dex unbuffed. With shammy and other buffs i hit the 255 marks no prob. A warrior is ALL about his/her gear we have nothing else to fall back on why cant are warrior items reflect this. Hows about 24/14 thats sounds more epic to me. Do warriors even have a weapon that has more damage then delay.<P>Its late and im rambleing but this what i think about most when i get beat down by a green mob 10 levels lower then me. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053093-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053093.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053093-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053093-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053093-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053093-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053093-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053093&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053093&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
