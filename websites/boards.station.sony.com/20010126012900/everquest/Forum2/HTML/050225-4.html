You mele just as well as them.  The are not overpowered.  The cleric buff and heals are MUCH better than the druids.  I have seen you post this same thing 3 times...You have several of our spells to.  *Summoned line*, we have some of your heal spells.  You need to pay attention.  Not every server is like yours.  Many  of the druids I know would welcome the cleric so they are not just the buffers.  When I play primary healer in group as my druid I can do nothing but snare a mob.  The rest of my spells are Buffs and my best 2 heals, along with SOW.  Most of the people who pick druid like to be able to melee just a bit, nuke, and buff.  They tend not to like being the main healer but will if the situation calls for it.<P>Please keep the suggestions for Clerics, until the Cleric thread that should start soon, I will fight for them as well I think they need a few more things, but will post it then.<BR>  <BR>-=-=-=-=-=<BR>The cleric will no longer be needed in 50+ groups.&lt;sniped a bit&gt;<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-<P>Clerics wont be needed??, you have better AC/Heal/Buffs than the druid.  The Nukes, DoTs, Damage Shilds, Regen spells not as useful if we are primary healer.  We don't have the mana to use those spell if we are PRIMARY HEALER.  Hence we do NOT, I repeat NOT, want to replace a cleric.  I have left groups because they would turn down a cleric and we had spots open.  These type groups are just not good players.<P>-=-=-<BR>The fact that they get Superior healing at 54 should completely shut their mouths!A cleric has inferior nukes,no dots,no traveling spells,and we cant solo worth crap at later levels.Clerics should be in a COMPLETE leauge of &lt;sniped a bit&gt;<BR>-=-=-<BR>Shut our mouths because we get Shealing at 54?  How about you wait until 44 to get Shealing??  Wouldn't make you happy would it?  Thats just it.  YOu are not in a LEAUGE OF YOUR OWN...  And if you really wanted to Solo you could do it.  Go get Jboots and you have SoW just like druids.  You can Solo undead all day.  If any of our spell are resisted when we are soloing then we have problems, and we solo because we can't get groups even at lower levels.  I have been relagated to kiting in Kunark because there were no groups for over 2 hours.  I would to loved to have gotten a Cleric with me, would of made it much easier.<P>-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>Alan you ARE infringeing apon us being the masters of healing!A druids roll in a group is NOT to be a primary healer which it will become. &lt;sniped a bit&gt;<P>-=-=-=-=-<BR>Where is the infringment?  You still are the masters of healing?  No our roll in a group is not to be a primary healer.  It is to keep your butt alive to heal the tanks.  Would you rather us casting a 280 pt heal or a 550-600pt heal on you when a mob is kicking your butt and the tanks are not doing thier job?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor<P>Please look at damage shields.  Pre 50 they are something that is very worth while.  Post 50 however the damage they do is a joke.  The non boss type mobs having well over 10K hit points and triple and quad hit for 150-200.  We go from 24 pts with the level 49 spell to 32 with the 58 spell.  Pre 50 a damage shield will do on average 20-30 percent of what the mob can hit for (if used on the on level mob about the same level as the spell).  After 50 it changes to 12 to 16 percent.  With the increase of mob hitpoints it makes damage shields a joke.  How about a damage shield that does a  percentage of damage based on how hard the mob hits?  Say 25% for druids and 30% for mages.  This would be more in line with the pre 50 game without over powering anyhthing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Excellent point Keana-Rathe.<P>Druids will not replace clerics because all those great spells we get go out the window when druids are the only healer. We can't afford to cast them, our mana has to go strictly to healing. We have to struggle just to keep a group alive. Whether it's a 30% fizzle rate or a heal that just doesn't keep up with damage. Regardless, druids suck as healers, our spells fizzle and very few are mana efficient. Remedy would not change that. <P>Druids also make crappy healers because they have not the AC or spells that allow them to deflect the agro long enough for tanks to taunt back off.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Keana-Rathe, no Resurrecting people not in our groups or raids is NOT a part of a Cleric's job.  I don't owe anyone a resurrection unless I specifically say that I will do so.  Druids can easily and safely get to a Druid ring.  Does that make anyone getting to a Druid ring have the right to receive a teleport from any Druid in the zone that is ungrouped?  Nope.  If I see a Druid at the ring, I don't give them a tell.  I auction to the entire zone saying I am at the ring, where I want to go, and how much I can pay.  Sure, I don't get teleports very quickly that way, but Druids don't owe me one.  Simply put, it is a perk of being a Druid, not their "job".</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Regarding quad-kiting....saw this posted on the Caster's Realm site under Enchanter Spells:<P><BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;MMMM COLOR SKEW., By [deleted]<P>Here's a cute little picture... think of this. 49 Pet summon.. pet hits for 52 Swift like the wind on Pet Give pet fine steel daggers or some such thing Pet dual wields, pet hits FAST for 52, also, pet bashes and kicks while dual wielding. I have found that using the color flux/shift/skew line of spells, it is possible for an enchanter pet to solo 3 dar ghoul knights/ 1 arch magi / 1 guk ghoul knight... whatever, in lower guk. Simply pull target with tashani, and begin the stuns... cast one.. wait a few seconds, cast next... wait a few seconds, cast the third. Lather, rinse, repeat. Pet will mow through your completely stunned target, and get hit perhaps 5-6 times during the whole fight if your chain-stunning is well practiced. I have repeatedly solo-ed the ghoul arch magi spawn in this fashion. Also, these are all area effect spells... so if something happens to spawn, or wander into the fight... it is also rendered helpless until your pet is finished with it's current target, and moves onto the new target. Very handy line of spells... stunning is your friend.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<P><BR>Absor, I don't think Druid and Wizard quad kiting even comes close to this kind of soloing ability. This is just one example.  I have been in many rooms in dungeons and castles and watched Necros, Mages, and Shamen solo camps and spawns we Druids and Wizards could never dream of soloing. In short, it is best to understand the big picture of what all classes are capable of soloing before taking offense at quad kiting.  Quad kiting is seen outdoors in very limited situations on very limted surfaces. This is only usable for a few levels ranks, not at every level. It is a fairly high risk operation. It looks really flashy those who may not have seen this before and easily makes others think  "this should not be possible."  But it is actually inferior to the situation desicribed above, regarding the enchanter, or the similar abilities of other pet classes. Finally, please consider what most common wandering outdoor mobs that could be quad-kited would drop---then----consider what our enchanter friend described above will get when his mob drops its loot!!!   Big difference!<P>Just wanted to dispell a patent falsehood and wide misperception about the "great gains"  and uniqueness of so-called quad-kiting.<P>Thanks,<P>Kelvyn, 47 Wiz/20 Druid - Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First off. Druids and Shamans do NOT and I mean NOT deserve a heal upgrade til 60, Superior heal is fine. I am a druid. 53rd druid. and I belive this DRASTICALLY infringes on a cleric's rites.. THe ONLY reason a druid's healing abilitys are not keeping up to mob damage, And is not COmperable. is simply because a druid didn't specialized in the ability. I am the only druid I know on Vallon Zek, Who Specialized in Alteration. and I heal fine.. I keep up to the mobs in sebelis without a Problem. I do not see any need to Insert a Upgrade til 60. Clerics were ment to be the Big time healers. Endless you were to give clerics somthing like Damage shields(which fits the role) or maybe even Regeneration. simply because it does Daunt balance in the game. Maybe Druids and Shaman should go visit the Ruby of Forgetfulness in Sol Temple and Figure out what it means to have specialization skills in the proper order. Super heal Fizzles cause your not good at it!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok its been my view that 2 of one class should be able to make up the slack of having one class absent. This is easily the case at lower levels where pickup groups are common but gets harder and harder as the levels get higher up... For those who say the dependency on clerics is a nessessity I think that the current system is over doing it.<P>I heard long ago that 2 Warriors, 2 Druids and 2 Shaman all of high level (50+) went to kill some stuff in a semi-hard place (there was about 4 mobs 100% MR so they couldnt be slowed at all thus all the 'healers' were reduced to the lowest common spell they had GHeal or SHeal)... Needless to say they got owned badly.<P>2 DRU + 2 SHM != 1 Cleric... Excuse me while I take the time to /rude anyone complaining about us Druids/Shaman getting SH at 44 or 49 to reduce the fizzle rate on these spells. Ok maybe we shouldnt get SH at that level but give us other healers something useful to use... What I would really love to see is some 'massive regeneration' spells the type that are 50-100HP/tick for like 30sec-1 minute (in comparison to a 10HP/tick for 5 minutes with chloro). These can keep the tank alive while your the primary healer but still leaves a cleric the most desired for the part. In the case that Druid/Shaman get lines like this PLEASE make them stack with eachother so that 1 DRU + 1 SHM almost = 1 CLR :P</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Why is it so hard to understand the problem here?  Druids and Shaman think they need a better heal because "when the cleric leaves" the party's over.  Let's examine this statement.  What you're saying is there are not enouh Clerics to fill the need?  Yes.  Now instead of trying to IMPROVE your OWN CLASS to justify this, take a look at the REAL problem...<P>    ----===================----<BR>    THE CLERIC CLASS IS BORING.<BR>    ----===================----<P>Your solution to improve your own classes to make up for the lack of Clerics would end result in... guess... That's Right!  Nobody wanting to make a cleric anymore because they are STILL not fun to play AND now the other classes have taken away from thier ONE and only class-defining ability (HEALING).<P>The solution is to FIX Clerics so they will be more enticing to play.  Hence you will get more people to play Clerics, and the problem is solved.<P>Backup healers will remain backup healers and not become Jack-of-all-trades PLUS Mega-Healer.  They will heal to keep people alive long enough so the Clerics can heal them fully.  Working as intended.<P>Adding to Dru/Sha class will cause the complete destruction of the Cleric class.  Those of us that ARE Clerics will not play them anymore.  You thought 16% server population of Druids was alot?  Wait til you see what happens if you give them these heal spells, Absor.<P>Instead of trying to solve this problem by buffing up classes that are ALREADY FUN TO PLAY because of thier diversity, why not buff up the Cleric class with some FUN spells and utility spells that would make them much more WANTED to be played, thus solving the Cleric shortage problem.<P>Oh, and FIX the fizzle rate on the Dru/Sha Superior Heal.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>forgive me if this was already covered. I hope that no one is actually planning on making druid damage shields credit the damage to the caster. It would make it far to easy for me to accidentally steal kills from guild mates during low/mid level dungeon crawls. <BR>Even when grouped with people in my level range in a fight with multiple mobs several of the mobs will be more then half damaged by the damage shields by the time the tanks are able to get around to killing them. <BR>If damage shields were changed as earlier mentioned it would only make me less inclined to cast them on strangers that are in need of help, so as to avoid having someone accuse me of kill stealing. It would take a good amount of utility away from the spell line as a whole in my opinion. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well. I don't play a druid. I play a low level alt cleric. My primary is a warrior. And, I'd like to just weigh in with an absurd and different perspective.<P>Warriors are unbalanced. We cannot heal. We cannot dot. We cannot travel. We cannot nuke. We cannot cast. We cannot gate. We cannot bind. We don't have a pet or charm.<P>As such, when the balance discussion for warriors comes up, I'll be proposing: a line of DOT spells, the ability to cast Sup Heal and CH (for higher level warriors), the ability to cast SoW, the ability to selfbuff HPs and AC, the ability to cast Bind Affinity, a pet line of spells (to keep us company), and maybe a nuke or two (not necessarily Ice Comet, but it would be nice).<P>I think that would make warriors balanced with all the other classes.<P>Can you see the absurdity in this? And this is what the druids (forget about the shamans for now since this isn't a discussion about their balancing) are basically asking. Let's take a whole lot of what the other classes have and give it to us, because (a) we're jealous that we can't do those things as well, and (b) we want to solo more so this will help us.<P>I'm sorry, but in my opinion, what the druids are asking for is SO selfish and SO self centered, that they have totally lost sight of what "balance" is and what it means to group. And, in my opinion, if Verant gives in to this type of outcry and pressure because they opened up the discussion, then I honestly plan to propose the above mentioned warrior suggestions when it comes time for our "balancing discussion."<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Fitten-Rathe: "Sounds like they have a monopoly to me. The group can't function without a cleric because there ARE NO backup healers at 50+. You have clerics, enchanters, and everyone else. Too many times have I seen (and been in) groups of 5 people without a cleric that sat at the Sebilis entrance for 2+ hours doing NOTHING while trying to find a cleric to join us only to have the group either break up because we all found other groups to join (with clerics in them) or we break up and all log out. It is not right for one class to have such a hold on the game as to make so many people not be able to play at all if they aren't present. Let me state again: There are NO backup healers in the 50+ game. You could have a group of three druid/shaman follow your group of 6 people around (which doesn't have a cleric) for healing and you would ALL die in Sebilis in just the upper floor camps. The lower floor camps are just impossible without a cleric."<P>Guess what? Im a 54th cleric and i've sat my butt at the Seb zone looking for a group also. If all the groups have one cleric in them guess what? I DONT GET A GROUP! Period. Clerics are at the very bottom of the list when it comes to filling an empty slot in a group that already has a cleric. No one ever seems to think about that do they? And like many have stated before me, in the above case i have no other options since im bound there at Seb. I cant port somewhere else and solo some blues. Or even port somewhere else to see if a cleric is needed. Im stuck sitting on my arse until a cleric leaves, while druids and shamans are filling up slots in groups. I deal with it. I either sit there waiting or log in another character. You can do the same. <P>And its total BS saying non-clerics group can't work in Seb. I've seen it happen MANY times. A high level shaman's slow spells are amazing. Add a good enchanter and MANY areas in Seb can be worked without a cleric. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Why should druids be catered to at 45 or 49+? Many pick the druid class because they can solo well and in turn level faster, but by making them more "raid friendly" you would be giving them the best of both worlds.  Many times we have been told that (paraphrased) "your class is balanced and it is the nature of the game for you to have to rely on other classes" but now it seems you may be reversing that decision. Will you give necros clarity or mez so they can be more "raid friendly" or how about give mages the ability of total control over their pets so that they can be used in the planes? Of course not, and with good reason doing so would unbalance the game.<P>If those who play high level druids want to become  more group friendly tell them to start a cleric or a chanter!  As of now, they still add greatly to a raiding group and should not be modified in that respect.  Just because they are not the primary class for some task such as mezzing, healing,buffs, nuking etc does not mean they need to be fixed!  I am a wizard therefore I nuke. That is my sole purpose, my secondary purpose is to evac but alas druids can do that just as well as I can.  The wizard class pays dearly for the ability to have the most mana efficient nukes in game, we cannot buff or heal others and we live with it.<P>As the old saying goes; jack of all trades, master of none.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think everyone is going off the deep end here....My view from a cleric standpoint (and yes I've played a druid too).<P>     I really dont see any need to modify any druid spells (add or take away)... Perhaps the fizzle rate should be reduced...But adding more healing tends to throw the class more in a cleric direction.  Some people have said that Chloro is useless.. I disagree..only Druids and Shamans get this type of Regeneration....I welcome druids into any of my groups because of this... While im medding, chloro or regrowth on the tanks helps top off their HPs so i dont have to waste mana dribbling little spells out to heal them to full...Clerics (allegedly the masters of healing) DO NOT...  If there was to be a remedy and DL type spell added to druids... I would expect the casting time and mana on Cleric healing to be reduced....Or perhaps give Clerics some sort of regeneration type spell (before you say we already have one (celestial heal), I'm talking long term regeneration like Chloro)... I've always wondered why clerics never got a long term regeneration....we are supposed to be masters of the healing arts are we not?<P>As for quad kiting.... *applaud druids*....Go for it guys... I dont want to be able to do this..Im a cleric, I heal.. You're a druid, go nuke!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Its fun to watch druids do this...Hey, if they can..more power to them... Kite all you like... But remember, the ability to do this makes you a very strong class... I wouldn't be wanting more stuff to go with this.<P>The one thing that I really, REALLY think needs improvement with Druids...the ARMOR... Druids NEED more armor quests and droppable armor... I agree, clerics got them beat on equipment...Seems that druids got the shaft on this...Been this way since release...need more mid level druid armor quests.<P>I think someone posted before "nerf clerics".. I cant remember his name but.... guess what... we already are... Not our equipment, but our spells... Retribution takes a year and a day to cast..and its our main DD till 54...it was nerfed from 550 to 516 damage... I dont see why they did that...There's no way we can solo big 50+ mobs with that... we'd go Out of Mana or end up dead from root breaking on us.... Sound of Force stun is highly resisted... and our heals... yes they are big...but also big mana... most of the clerics I know and myself included strive to be very mana efficient (waiting for a mob to take the tank down low then Complete heal...or low enough then Divine light)... Group healing spells, although usefull, are a big drain on the manapool...I only use them to top off everyone...or during certain raids where AE damage is imminent (Lord Rak'Ashir(sp)).  Remedy is an awesome spell...but.. try healing your tanks with it over and over again... you'll go oom quick.  As the masters of healing, its sad to see that our high level heals are so mana intensive..... Quite honestly.. I wouldn't mind to see druids get the healing spells you are talking about...But it would be easier to swallow as a cleric if you reduced our casting times and/or mana usage.<P>The moment they get Complete heal tho... You've stepped over the line.<P>Fibbik Greythorn<BR>Cleric of Rathe<BR>Pope of Rivervale<BR>MFH</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well I am not going to read the 4 pages of messages.  I skimmed through them and now I will add my intelligent peice to the boards.<P>Going to address these as I remember them from the boards.<P>1. Do Druids need better heals or regen type spells.<P>In my honest opinion, YES.  Fix the spell Superior Fizzle.  If you wish to keep the fizzle rate then drop that spell pre 50 and add a better heal spell post 50.  I see alot of folks posting that this would take away from the clerics.  LOL.. ya right.. like anyone takes the place of a cleric.  I have played my druid for 56 lvls now and I am damn good.  Reason I am good is cause I know the other classes.  For those that feel our heal is good enough.. well then.. Play some more in high lvl groups and tell me that.  Have your cleric CH'ing one warrior as the secondary tank is dropping hp and fast.  A good druid knows his place in a group.  They are there for more then just a few nukes and to snare a mob or evac.  They provide secondary healing, buffs, damage to mobs, and interference to help keep the mobs off the enchanter long enough for them to mez them.  Do I want my cleric wasting all his mana on the enchanter to keep them alive.  Hell no.  Thus my heal spells, but I don't wanna go oom trying to cast 1 heal.  Add another heal spell or lower the mana cost and fizzle rate on sup heal.<P>2.  Druids with pets.<P>You played 55 levels without a pet.  What the hell you need one for now?  For those that are clueless how to kite a high lvl mob with a pet.  Here is the command.  /pet taunt off<BR>Honestly, we don't need a pet.  Waste of mana, time and effort.  Just another useless spell that should go right in the back of your book with all the others.<P>3.  Spells<P>Druids are masters of the outdoors and yet nothing to show that.  There is no class defining spells for a druid (outside the parlor trick to change the rain).  Every class has some sort of ability that no one else has.  Unfortunately, druids no longer have this ability.  Jack of all trades and master of none.  I would like to see more group friendly spells, meaning, something that no other class can offer to the group.  Just like enchanters, clerics, shamans, Rangers, etc...<BR>Also, it wouldn't hurt ya to make some of the druid spells more dungeon related.  <BR>Also, if you create or enchance spells, for the love of all that is holy put them at a vendor.  Nothing makes me more peived then having to try and find a group to get spells that help the group.  Adding the port spells to the vendor was awesome.<P>4.  Deity based<P>Ok.. you all have just alienated and entire deity with PoG.  I chose the path less followed and worship karana.  Needless to say, I have no need to be in PoG nor can I wear any of the quest armor that comes out of it cause it's DEITY BASED.  Don't know the logic behind that one.  <P>Followers of tunare have no restrictions in place for them.  Yet they can wear some of the best armor this game has to offer.  FIX IT... <BR>Oh ya.. Wake of Karana - change weather spell.. should change all weather not just rain, and should be DEITY BASED.. Why the hell would a follower of Tunare get something that changes the weather?  <P>A port to surefall or some where close to Qeynos would be nice.  Port to G.Fay?  Should utilize the druid rings and make a DEITY based port for those that follow tunare to be able to Single Gate only to there.  <P>INCREASE the DROP RATE on DRUID SPELLS 54 +.  You have the most popular class being nerfed on spells cause they dont' drop as much.  So, simple math, increase the drop rate on the druid spells or make them more easily quested for those that can't seem to find a group.  Oh ya.. Charm Plant.. dumb spell, somone was smoking some leaf when they thought of that one. <P>There are alot of great ideas to help enchance the most popular class without causing balance issues for those that like to whine about it.<P>Snare, root stack.. very nice.. where they hell was this about 40 lvls ago.. better late then never i suppose.<P>Keaian<BR>56 Preserver  (sigh I am something you put in jelly)<BR>Prexus </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The thing that I would like to see someone look into is the negative effect Wolf Form has on faction.  I realize that the faction effect was a 'fix' to something that was around since Beta, but I think the 'fix' has gone a little too far and affected NPC's which it shouldn't.<P>Here is an example:  When I zone into Qeynos Hills and change into WF my faction does not change with the guards or the vendors.  Why?  Easily explained.  Surefall Glade is a hop skip and a jump away.  The area is patrolled by Ranger's and Druid's. When I zone into Rivervale or Misty Thicket, the NPC's don't bother me in WF.  So why is it that in POG I am regarded indifferently in Human form but dubiously in WF?  This is a plane run by a god of nature...  There are animals everywhere (including wolves).  So why does my faction get worse when I assume the form of an animal?<P>This of course is a case which stands out because  the zone is dedicated to nature.  But I'm sure there are other NPC's in the game whose faction changes negatively for no other reason than it was an oversight.<P>For the longest time our faction would actually get better in WF, worse case scenario it would remain unchanged.  Then, out of nowhere the faction is 'fixed'.  Now, instead of getting better or neutral faction, we get worse faction... Please take a look at this.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have played EverQuest since Beta 3.  Having said that, I think I have a certain amount of applicable experience.<P>I think that the classes are balanced - for the most part.  There is absolutely no way you are going to balance the classes perfectly.  "You can please some of the people, some of the time.  But you can't please all of the people all of the time."  That statement is accurate.<P>If there is one glaring problem with EQ it has to be the looting system.  Simple.  Like I said, I've played since beta 3, but I quit for almost year?  Why?  Because the game grows old when you play on servers that have been around for a long time.  There is no item degredation, no level limits on items.  Come on.  If there is one overiding and glaring problem that I have seen numerous people discuss, it is equipment/twinking.  <P>I have to agree with Elemer.  It takes away a great deal of fun with the game.  The only thing that brought me back to the game, was the friendship that you find there (and don't find as well).  Did I join my old server (Xegony), no way.  Started on a new server.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>To the powers that be:<P>Ok, I saw that this thread had started and, at first, I thought I would dutifully read through all the other posts before I put my two cents in.  Now however, I admit that my message board reading time hasn't kept up with the speed of the added text, so I'm giving up on that thought and throwing my two cents in while I still can.  Forgive me if I recover old ground.<P>As someone who has played a druid up to level 53, I feel I have a good understanding of the class to that point.  I believe that up to and including level 50, druids are well-rounded and fun to play, as long as the ability to solo kite isn't nerfed away.<P>From 51 on(and even prior to that if we talk strictly in the context of grouping) druids are a class that bring very little to the table for a group.  There is nothing that the druid does that isn't done better by everyone else.  This is to be expected of a jack of all trades kind of class, but it has just gotten out of hand.  Druids spells of all kinds are just weak by comparison to other classes, and the result is that groups never seek a druid, but they will put up with them as a poor third place choice if they can't find something better.<P>Commenting briefly on the other opionions floated...I don't believe druids should be given complete heal, I think that is the province of clerics, but their higher level heal shouldn't be such a joke as it presently is.  I don't believe druids should be able to multi-kite, and I can say that I made concious decision to never employ this tactic with my character.  I think nerfing the powerleveling properties of a druid do nothing but devalue the class and since powerleveling helps a lot of other classes, I believe that would be a mistake.  <P>People have stated all sorts of reasons that druids are the most popular class, but most of them are not the reason that I chose to be a druid.  It certainly wasn't the kiting, the powerleveling, or even the misguided idea that they were powerful.  I just wanted to see the virtual world, so the travelling capabilities were something that led me to a druid. Unfortunately, I find in my characters mature years that all I am good for is a taxi, and that is rather disappointing.<P>I won't presume to dictate a precise formula for how the class should be fixed.  By the recent changes in exp, you've made me as a player want to group more, but you haven't made groups want my druid more, so I'm stuck playing alternates primarily.  Please address this issue.<P>Thanks,<P>on E'ci...<P>Farrwalker Travels (53 Druid)<BR>Krasni Thunderhands (40 Monk)<BR>Sgecko Dahnecro (21 Necro)<BR>Gotter (16 Cleric)<BR>Farrwalk (16 Ranger)<BR>Oomish (16 Enchanter)<BR>Rebell (10 Rogue)<BR>Whopper (8 Warrior)<BR>Kimmis (8 Shaman)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Greetings,<P>Had a couple of things I would like to see brought up in one of your tuning meetings specifically the one regarding druid blanace.<P>As a druid I have to agree that we are one of the best balanced classes in the game ... (largely due to the jack of all trades emphasis of our class)<P>More Teleports .. you touched on this a bit but talked about the problems of redoing zones tpo create the graphics... some zones with existing graphics that I would like to see used:<P>Ocean of Tears<BR>Greater Faydark<BR>Lesser Faydark<BR>South Karana<BR>West Karana<BR>Rathe Mountains<P>Would also be nice to have more regular teleport sites in Kunark as we have only a group spell to the dreadlands (a self port would be nice) and wind of the north and south only work from Kunark dungeons that are considered "indoors" (example city of Mist cannot evac to Emerald Jungle because it is not considered an indoor dungeon... I can evac there from Karnors).<P>One of the keys to underutalization is the diffculty in getting aq group together and getting it from point a to point b .. I understand how this is designed in relatioinship to a new continent and all and I do think more bind points will help to a degree... maybe some rings to be discovered like those in velious might be in order (ie visit and get the token and you can use them).<P>Enough on Teleports... on to underutalized spells:<P>Speed spells:<P>Spirit of Cheetah, Scale of Wolf / Spirit of Scale, (upgrade to Share Wolf Form).<P>Spirit of wolf is certainly a desired spell, perhaps the most desired spell there is... <P>Spirit of Cheetah was never a very widely used spell 30 second duration 115% speed increase.. like many other druids I used it as a cross a zone quickly spell .. at least until the fix that stopped it from being reset upon zoning.. now it takes 15 minutes to recycle... This was designed as a fast escape spell but is rarely if ever used in that capacity due to the increadibly long recycle time .. would like to hear of some alternatives being discussed regarding this spell having the recycle time and or duration adjusted to make it a desired spell once more...<P>Scale of Wolf and the group Version Spirit of Scale have never been popular spells.  There was alot of debate regarding them at their initial release and further adjustments that had to be made later on ... not once have I ever been asked to cast this spell ... and other than testing it I do not use it myself....  it was understood that it was not meant to be an upgraded spell for Kiting .. and as such casting spells or attacking something would cause it to drop .. as do being hit by a spell or ranged weapon (I recall it was fixed so that either ranged or melee attacks can't recall which don't make it drop)... Frankly with a druids abilty to slow a targets movement and to speed their own movement I never understood why this was such a concern.. if I am kiting a mob SOW is plenty fast in combination with any form of snare... I think the use of the spell should be discussed once again there has been suffcient time for a metric of use to be established... without a change it will remain a unused pair of spells at the back of the book. (these would fit the bill for the many requests for a SOW II / Pack Spirit II). <P>Upgrade to Share Wolf Form... Druids get the group wolf form spell at 39th level and it is great to a degree... I have found a niche for an upgrade to it in that many of the hybrids and others I group with have ultravision .. and do not really want the share wolf form spell as it cancels their ultravision... eventually the druids wolf form grants them ultravision and so a group verison of such a spell would be nice for those people or perhaps just an alteration to the exsisting spell .. would be nice to have a next stage of this spell though .. little extra attack / speed / ultravision...<P>There have been a number of other suggestions I won;t repeat here I thought were good ones and I am sure you will do what you can.<P>A last note would be the Quad Kiting issue as I thought the limitation of the aoe to four mobs was a restriction this issue would actually touch any class with an aoe spell as I have witness members of other classes do this as well should probably disassociated from druids to a seperate topic.<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't think, at level 34, you have seen the effect that is being discussed here.  Post level 50, Clerics become irreplaceable.  In fact, I helped raid Naggy and Vox this weekend with my lvl 50 druid, and frankly, without the clerics we would never have survived either raid.  I was fairly useless once the battle began.  I helped people gather for the raids, blasted during the trash clearing, but greater heal is useless when CH is being used.<P>I have NO interest in replacing clerics.  I play regularly with a couple of clerics.  When neither is online, we have to revert to green crap or getting those items we missed out on in lower level dungeons.  We are even in danger of losing one of our clerics to an UBERguild because she is ALWAYS being invited on raids by that guild. <P>message to you clerics?  Stick with it. You become the single most necessary class at 50+.

</FONT><HR>In a perfect world I'd want every class to feel needed because of the specialties they bring to a group.  For some classes this is more obvious than others.<P>Yay a cleric, now we can Heal!<BR>Yay a shaman, now we can Slow!<BR>Yay an enchanter, now we can Mez!  etc.<P>I'm a bard.  For most of the game my feeling when a druid joined a group was<P>Yay a druid, now we can Regenerate!<P>In the lower levels, a lot of the downtime and even a good percentage of damage healed during a fight was covered by the regeneration line.  I've always equated this line with one of a druid's reason for existing.  It's always been my favorite buff.<P>The last time I thought to my self "Gosh, it's a good thing we have a druid" was in the Karnor's Castle captain area.  We were a pickup-group some months ago, levels 49-53, four tanks, the druid, and myself.  With regeneration, medium heals from the druid, and the songs, we were able to stay ahead of the meanies.  And when someone trained us after a couple hours, we all lived to zone because the druid had kept sow on all of us (Karnor's is an outside zone).  Go druid!  Then we all went back to our spot.<P>My non-druidic, non-clerical, non-shamanite opinion is that people should be able to say "Yay, regeneration!" in higher level groups.  I confess I don't know the numbers on the higher regeneration spells, if there are any beyond chloro or what they're called.  For game balance purposes giving druids a better heal might suffice, but it makes druids more like clerics and less like druids were meant to be.  I would love to see druids be given a knock-your-socks-off regeneration spell, on the order of 100 hp/tick.  This type of healing is more fun to play with and even to depend on, it leads to much different strategies than the warrior-cleric-yawn.<P>This, and the hp-mod-rod idea that someone had way back in the posts somewhere, would make druids a consideration in a "best" group or in a big raid.<P>Sincerely,<P>Yixil Rumor</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050225-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050225.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050225-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050225-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050225-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050225-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=050225&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=050225&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
