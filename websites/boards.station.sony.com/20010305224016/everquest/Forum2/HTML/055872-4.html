</FONT><HR>Well, a big RUDE to you Absor for saying you blatently skipped my post.<BR>"You will not evade me Absor."<BR>Seriously though, this is a genuine post from a ranger's heart, please READ it.<P>Let me start by saying that some of the changes are great and appreciated however some are too little too late.<BR>I'm happy that you are focusing on lower level rangers, but none of the level 22 spells that are on Test will help me now.<BR>We need to look back on WHAT a ranger is.<BR>A ranger is a hunter with a bow and arrows who lives off the land.<BR>This is my first complaint about rangers: there is no real use of the bow implemented into group play.<BR>Sure we can solo better with it, but this is a group oriented game; the ranger should excel at archery not be exactly the same as a warrior.<BR>A warrior has the same critical hits as a ranger, but normally has higher strength for harder hits.<BR>This actually makes some warriors BETTER at archery than rangers.<BR>We need something to seperate Rangers from other bow users.<BR>We need something original like magic arrows that can poison, or stun.<BR>Maybe we should have bows that shoot fire arrows or somthing that would make using a bow worth more than just pulling a Mob.<BR>I personally have a raincaller, it's great for stats, but that's it.<BR>With only five unrenewable charges, I don't intend to ever use them.<BR>Archery is a difficult skill to build, I personally have over 150 skill and miss almost every shot: that is unacceptable.<BR>Also, it's not very realistic to be standing on a hill and be unable to shoot an arrow at something lower than you.<BR>The heighth issues with archery are unrealistic and need to be changed.<BR>Make rangers more like a sniper with magic archery abilities (stay true to the original concept of what a ranger is in traditional roleplaying).<P>My second complaint is spell based ( cause quite frankly I do NOT think any class should match warriors in Def or Off ), but we are half druid, and this needs to be emphasized more heavily.<BR>One of the first things to define a ranger spell-wise was snare.<BR>This has been stripped of Rangers and WE NEED IT BACK.<BR>Now Druids, Wizards, SK's, and Necro's can all snare so whoopty do that a Ranger can.<BR>We need a snare that overpowers the other classes; I mean at high levels of course, we should get a snare with a bonus.<BR>Perhaps snare will also slow a mob or dot it, not a massive complement to snare, but perhaps a 20% slow or a 100dmg DoT.<BR>Just anything to bring back the pride we once had in the spell.<BR>We are supposed to be half warrior, half druid, that's why we are called Hybrids.<BR>I'll tell you Absor i sure don't feel like a druid.<BR>First I really have to question why our meditation skill stops at 39, why is that? <BR>My wisdom is very low (due to lack of decent ranger wisdom equipment), yet I still have to meditate for 20 minutes like a level 39 ranger.<BR>I am, however, grateful for the mana boost that you granted us, thank you. <BR>Second you don't see any rangers quad kiting.<BR>I'm not saying we should be able to, but my god at least give us bind or something other than druid spells 25+ levels later than they get them.<BR>Some of our spells are so weak that our parent Druids actually laugh at us for the level we get them. <BR>Perhaps rangers can get a weak shaman pet, I'm not saying we should have a level 49 necro pet, but rangers are the true friend of animals, not those treehugging Druids.<BR>We should at least get some of the animal charm series.<BR>One improvement that would help rangers greatly would be to increase the duration of our buffs.<BR>I have to recast three to four buffs every five minutes. <BR>A thought, which would benefit several classes, would be to add two more spell slots in fullscreen mode, there is plenty of space for this.<BR>I believe this would promote the use of some of the more obscure spells that collect dust in the spell book.<P>Because almost all of a Rangers skill are capped between lvl 39 and 50 I think this is the best place to start improving the class.<BR>Also, I agree that the disarm skill (at the current skill cap for rangers) is quite useless.<BR>This is a very difficult time for Rangers, so the spells and skills we get at 39 have to carry us to 50.<BR>Also, we are the only Hybrids without an ability.<BR>Sk's get HT, Pally's get LH, Ranger's get...well stuff that a lot of other classes already have .<BR>VI is trying to balance the classes, maybe you can never achieve that.<BR>Think more about individualizing classes instead.<BR>Ranger need an ability too.<BR>Yes, pluses to defense and HP's would be great, but I'd like to see a little more originality from VI.<BR>I would like to see a slight increase to ranger HP, and a dramatic increase to ranger defense.<BR>I am satisfied with ranger offense being where it is, except for dual weild and double attack.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>LOL, Absor really screwed himself over when he admitted he skipped over a lot of the posts.  Now people, who know their voices haven't been heard, are just reposting everything they believe Absor may have skipped over the first time around.<P>Absor, this is our class discussion.  Many rangers have long awaiting the beginning of this thread with what they perceive to be valuable ideas and opinions. Every post here deserves to be read on its own merit, regardless of whether it's repetitive or not.  To skip over a large majority of them would be a great injustice, and typical of Verant's attitude towards rangers in general.<P>Please read what we have to say.  All of it.  Don't make us feel unheard at the most critical moment in our class's history, because when all is said and done, changes are made, and no one likes them, the "Absor skipping over half our class discussion" thing will come back to haunt you, most likely.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have noticed that high lvl rangers usualy aggro a lot, particularly when swinging fast weapons duel wielding, rangers are not tanks, they should not be taking the hits, yet their fast weapons, and duel wielding, and spells, aggro really really well.<P>I also noticed, that Rangers get hide at lvl 25, and sneak at 10. Yet, they get camoflauge at 15. negating the need for the hide skill (which caps out at 75).<P>Rogues, when they get high up on the hate list, use evade to lower themselves. Why can't rangers? Rangers get sneak/hide as a class abilty, why not make them usefull? Give rangers Evade. They need to be able to drop down on the hate list. If a ranger is not getting beat on, he doesn't need to worry about more HP, more AC or higher defense skills (though having a high dodge makes sense in a ranger way). Rangers are not tanks. They are dmg dealers.<P>Also, increase sneak or hide, (if not both, then sneak at least), and let them be used together to move while hidden, at least in outdoors, rangers are hunters after all. They use the bow, yet they can't sneak up on their prey...<P>Lastly, make archery a viable form of melee combat. It is expensive. I know there is this problem with manaless dmg. But think of it as Melee damage with a component. Imho it should be doing as much dmg as a melee weapon (minus strength bonuses). And it is expensive! Sure, the ranger could just summon some arrows with his tolans bracers, but they are dmg 1, range 75, and that is junk as far as arrows are concerned (other than being magic), with good arrows, you are litteraly shooting PP at your enemy. So it doesn't take mana, and it isnt in melee, well, it cost money. Thats a fair trade. With my lvl 31 ranger, I am litteraly shooting 1.2 gold every time I fire my bow. and if I was using magic arrows, that would jump to 2 pp per arrow (I make long range arrows.) This adds up fast when you realize that I have one 10 slot bag filled with arrows, and two 8 slot packs filled with materials to make more. I go through half of my supplies during 1 full day of play. (I bow kite for fun =P). It adds up fast.<P>Elma Soulseer<BR>Knights of Phoenix<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hail there fellow rangers, and hail Absor (hope you read this posting)<P>well i am a lvl 38 ranger at the moment (1 lvl till SOW WOOOOT!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">) and i think that at my lvl the ranger class just kicks ass! we rock and we ar balanced. but there are some points i would like to say:<P>1. i group alot with a druid from my gild lately, i know we are the children of the druid's but when i am grouped with a druid my mana is always full! i sneare the mob once that lasts for te howle fight. then all i can do is bashing the mob's ass! i cant cast my DoT cause the druid would kill me (stacking...) and i cant cast my DD cause it deals only 37 points of dmg... well i make more than 37 dmg in a good attack with my two blades... i dont know how the situation will change with 39 when ill get the 99 DD... but i would sugest to give the rangers at 30 or eaven 35 a DoT that stacks with the Druidish dots... that would ROCK! make it a 150dmg DOT... i dont care if it wear only 100Dmg but give us a DoT that stacks! that would kick ass!<P>2. Call of Flame. Well it is indeed a COOL thing to dish out 202 DMG in one spell. but hey 2 lvl's after this we get a 302 dmg spell that only needs 30 points mana more... and the quest for the Call of Flame is HARD! thats not right make Call of Flame more of a "the spell of spells" spell... well it is the only quest spell we have... it should be something that kick ass! (a new DoT? a levitate sow combo? a see invis ultravision combo? that would be KICK ASS!)<P>3. hide. well i dont want this sneak hide thing rouges got... we have camo after all... but PLEASE at a message to hide like rouges got! (you have hidden yourself from view, you falied to hide youself) there is nothing more anyoing then to hit the hide button and have to wait till a mob waks by to consider him to see wahter you are hidden or not. and come on thats not unbalancing at all! it would just make hide more usable!<P>4. track  i like the changes you have made with track and i like the thinks you are going to do (sorting and scrolling) but there is one thing i would like to see: let us be able to track corpses. well look at it from the roulplaying point of view (it is a roulplay game after all isnt it?) why would the tracks of some one how just died disappear? that not logical... well its also not logical that we can track mob's that fly or mobs under whater  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>5. charm animal, well this is not a balancing issue but a rouleplaying thing. i would just LOVE the have this wolf or bear wandering at my side! give the rangers at lvl 39 a spell with witch we can charm wolfes and bears (just low lvl ones... let us charm gray wolfs, black wolfs, shadow wolfs, black bears, young codiacs and codiacs up to lvl 10 or 11) and after the charm has worn of let the animal just wander of! dont make them attack the ranger! come on a ranger is the friend of the animals why would they attack him? a animal that looks abon you amiaby would love to wander with you and wound not attack you! well thats just one thing i woud LOVE to see that would give EQ a bit of the rouleplaying thing back...<P>thats all i have to say i hope you read this poste absor<P>so long<P>Ellric Dashwood, Woodelvish Ranger of Tunare, 38th Circle - Wolfsclan - Solusek Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor, you recently responded to me thusly:<P>Tenox said:<P>&gt;"It's interesting that we come to the table with "changes" already in place on test. Changes that had no input from these very discussions which I believe was the whole point. That seems prejudicial, but I will post in the hope that my ideas will be considered anyway."&lt;<P>"You're kidding yourself if you don't believe that Ranger talk hasn't already been done a dozen times, both on this board and on class specific boards. And you're kidding yourself even more if you think our team doesn't read those boards. The changes made were based on player suggestions made in preparation for this thread."<P>I wasn't kidding myself.  I knew that the Ranger community had voiced our cocerns many times.  About the team reading the boards, I'll take your word on that.  What concerns me is if the team bothers to UNDERSTAND and CONSIDER the posts of our concerns.  For instance, you say that the changes on test are from those previous talks.  Funny that by far the most asked for change (higher defense) has never even been tried on test to my knowledge.  A simple trial doesn't seem that out of order.<P>My skepticism stems from long exposure to the apparent indifference of Verant.  This is nothing new, we have been fighting this fight since Kunark.  Ignored for a very long time and thrown a bone in the form of dodge and parry increases, a bone with not much meat on it. <P>I'm trying to give you the benefit of the doubt here, so far you seem willing to at least listen to some of us, I just wonder if the team will. Your predecessor is viewed by many as openly contemptous of the hybrid classes.  His Modus Operandi was usually to just dismiss everything we said.  Maybe you will understand my worry when you read what he has recently said while this balancing process is supposedly being evaluated. His latest:<P><BR>From Official EverQuest chat with Sony Online Entertainment February 7, 2001 4pm PST RPGPlanet lobby in GameSpy Arcade<BR>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt; *mOoK_* Recently it was stated that Ranger's Offensive skills were raised to the level of Warrior's, when all of the other hybrid's defensive skills were raised, why is that? As if our AC wasn't low enough! <P>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt; Rangers are offensive in nature, palys, sks, and bards are defensive in nature. Those classes were design around that. We decided to give the classes a bigger piece of their parent for one side of melee. As for your AC, yes, it's lower. Try not to get hit  Next <P><BR>See anything wrong with that?  That's the attitude we had from the time before Kunark launched till you started posting.  I at least, and others are a bit wary of how much consideration we will really be given seeing how dismissive some of Verant are.  "Try not to get hit", gee, I don't know, maybe Defense might help in that.... <P>I really hope we do get a fair appraisel, and I think you at least will try for your part to get us one, and I thank you for that.  But please don't tell me I'm kidding myself when I think it's an uphill battle.  The apparent indifference of the Live Team, the statements made to Sunmoon that never came to pass, the scorn, yes scorn, of Gordon.... No, I don't think I'm kidding myself.<P>Thanks for your time.<P>-Tenox a passionate Ranger advocate.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As rangers are supposed to be the masters of the outdoors, why not give them a self only invis that works on both normal and undead creatures.  In order to stop it from being over used it should work like wolf form and be self only work in the zone it was cast in provided it was outdoors.  I think a ranger of sufficient level would be able to blend into the landscape enough so that even undead wouldnt see him/her.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>8XXXXXXX|########################&gt;                                      <P>Sorry about the sarcastic in advance. <BR>I would also like to say sorry about the spelling...<P>Correct me if I’m wrong, Paladins are tanking light Clerics. There key traits are lay of hands, light buffs, light healing, root, stun, and rez. Now Shadow Knights are tanking Necromancers There key traits are harm touch, engulfing darkness, pet, life tape, fear, light dots, and fain death. Now Rangers are attacking druids, the damage dealers of a group if a Warrior is not there what do we add to a group. We have snare, root, track, sow, light stats buffs, low dots and low nukes, and some utility spells. Now what are druids key traits Tp’s, sow, wolf form, nukes, dots, evacs descent buffs, charm animal, charm plants, fear animals, fear plants, snare, and root. Now the other two hybrids take their base classes key traits at a later time or at a lesser degree. Paladins have lay of hands, rez and stun. Shadow Knights have pets, harm touch, fear. Rangers have SOW, and track, ?? <BR>I think Rangers should take more after Druids. Rangers already have low HP like druids we got lots less mana, but that’s how it should be. We could use better nukes and dots. This will not happen because we are the damage dealers right, but our spells don’t put out much damage. Why cast spells when you can do more dmg fighting up close. If not then we could use some more utility spells. Befriend animal-30, charm animal-39, (see invisible-49-REALY NEED THIS), scale of wolf-49, beguile animal -49, allure of the wild-55, Group wolf form-55, and spirit of cheeta-55. I also think that eye’s of cat should be not self only. I also was wondering if or when tracking will be finished. If you are thinking that the animal charm spells are not Ranger type spells. Well we already have calm animal and fear animal now, so why can’t we charm them? Please don't give us some low level charm animal at like 49 where we can only charm animals level 15 and under. How often do you see a level 15 in EW in SOV? ooooo I got a pet snow bunny go get him killer... <BR>	Another option is that our 72min Ranger only skill like LH and HT we can a permant charm but it will work on animals and plants if your god is TUNARE you can charm animals 5 levels lower then you, but you can also charm plants 15 levels lower then your level. Karana is the mirror image of TUNARE 5 levels below on plants and 15 for animals. Dont want to have the Karana followers up in arms. 8)  That are at least 5 levels below the Rangers level. Now here it comes no no no Rangers don't get pets. AAAAA but our parant class does at high levels. Another thing is that this is not a pet spell its a charm, We just can't pull this out of thin air like other classes. So it is very limited how many zones you can use this in so because of this fact when you zone if you have a pet still charmed it resets the counter. If not you still have to wait the rest of your 72 min. Here is some reasons why I think we should have this skill. <P>1) Druids can charm animals or plants depending on religion, <P>2)We have no skills like LH or HT that is ours alone ( I know other classes have pets), <P>3) Rangers are the deffenders of the forists right (along with druids) and Druids are our parant class thay can charm animals and summon pets. Why would a Ranger that deffends the forist not be able to make friends with the forist creatures?? <P>4)Lest compare the other hibrids 72 min spells. Paladins have "Lay of Hands" = (1hp +32*level) heal---parant class Claric = Healing. Shadow knights have "Harm Touch" = (1hp+10*level also has 1/3 foot knock back aka spell stopper) Direct Damage---parant class necromancer = Death magic. Ranger have no 72 min skill but will through my idea in as if for comparison "Call of the Wild" = (see discription above) Charm --- parant class druid = Guardians of Nature (AKA animals love them).<P>5) There is no way absor is ever going to give us anything like bind/gate I can under stand this, but not TP's thay are our parants most defining skill. But we all have to get reall he will never let us have tp's or gates.<P>6) There is no way absor is going to up our deffence/parry/riposte/ac/hp. So this skill could help with our very messed up deffence skills in some zones. <P>7) If you say it is more powerfull then the Paladins LH and the SK HT then you are not seeing the down side of it. You have to find your pet you cant just make one. Also the skill can only be used in some zones not all.<P>8)absor already said bows will never ever ever be a primar weapon. So we need to go for something we can use. (look at his reply in the part 3) We all been yelling about the problems of bows and what was on his list, the missing due to target being off your plain.<P>9)We will never get nukes or dots that are any good even thoug druids have a 1024hp dd called Wild fire 320mana usage cast time 6.5 recast 3. Can you say "honney whats cooking" and our best is what agine 444-450 dd Calefaction  250 mana usage cast time of 2.5sec 45sec recast time. Same with dots our best is Drones of doom 340 dot using 141 mana. The druids have a Winged Death 1287 dot mana 350 looks like a little bit of deffernce in dmg out put there... almost for got we never get any good AF spells but not much need for them...<P>New idea for Ranger more of a utility spell. Give us a spell like Eye of  Zomm but make it a small bat or a mini griffen somthing flying or even make it a rat somthing cool like that. We suppost be the pullers right. Well Ranger can't pull in dungion enviroments think of it as a scout for the Ranger.... Example..... ranger walking along walks around a corner oooo my god there is 20 mobs in the room.... /e Ranger hits the train button toot toot train on the way to zone and guess what you all going to die...... but Ranger dont make (no sow) no way to get mobs off him so he dead meat and more then likly the group too...<P>Think I tryed to get the point across don't think it will help though.... from what I saw in the post  from absor. He has very selective reading skills. No insalt intended 8)<P>If you would I would like you to tell us why you say No to our ideas and what is wrong with it NEED EXAMPLES said by "absor" I don't think this is to much to ask We have to prove why we should have it. At least you can tell us why we can't. Here is my example, you are talking to a someone and you want him to do somthing or ask him why he did somthing and he just says because. how would that make your feel???¿¿ I know what it does for me I get torked off bad. If someone can't give me a good reason or proff then it is very degrading. Think of it this way you have just discoverd the cure for AIDS but the goverment says sorry we cant let you use that cure. You as why """" BECAUSE WE SAY SO""""". Now if thay would have said that because the cure for AIDS causes Heart problems, brain canser, strokes, birthdefects, and makes your arms and legs fall off. Well you feel a better about not letting people use it.<BR>___________________________________________________________________<BR>From Official EverQuest chat with Sony Online Entertainment February 7, 2001 4pm PST RPGPlanet lobby in GameSpy Arcade <BR>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt; *mOoK_* Recently it was stated that Ranger's Offensive skills were raised to the level of Warrior's, when all of the other hybrid's defensive skills were raised, why is that? As if our AC wasn't low enough! <BR>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt; Rangers are offensive in nature, palys, sks, and bards are defensive in nature. Those classes were design around that. We decided to give the classes a bigger piece of their parent for one side of melee. As for your AC, yes, it's lower. Try not to get hit Next<BR>Abashi if you are telling us not to get hit then give us a way to control agro better or dont tell us to try and not get hit please its kina insalting.....<BR>____________________________________________________________________<BR>  This point there is a snow balls chance in hell of getting these.<BR> Now lets see what key traits that Druids have and Rangers don’t. The key thing about being a druid is the ability to TP them self or others. Now druids are going to wig out on this say we are cutting into their TP money. Well let’s see how often do they really TP? Can you ever really find a TP when you want one, unless you want to pay 100pp? If you don’t want to pay, they just let you yell. I know you will not go for letting us TP others but I would not mind a self-only TP’s at around 50 -60. The druids can keep there evacs that’s not the point Rangers are explores wanders not needing anyone. <BR>             Ok back to reality now 8)<P>I hope that my requests are not to rash but I do think our new attack and old defense skills are good if we are to take after Druids if not then we need work on dodge/parry/riposte caps. "Now your not going to tell me that a guy with full plate non flexible and limits movement can out fight a guy that is fast and is using none binding flexible armor. &lt;----- LOOK AN  EXAMPLE"<BR> "It is sad when a 49 Ranger loses 3-4 bubs of life and used up a bub or two of mana on a green dire wolf. When a 40 Paladin killed it with 1-2 bubs of life and no mana killing a blue mob think that’s sad. I’m sorry about the story but hope it makes a point."&lt;----8) another example. <P>stuff that others have said that I think have valid points..<P>We should have the dodge/parry/riposte caps of rogues/monks. To quote a previous post: 'Being a dual wielding class, we should be better at skills like parry and riposte over classes that are limited to one weapon. Being limited to lighter chain classes of armor would make you believe we should be able to dodge better then someone in full plate. Its pretty amazing if you look at it from that angle that ranger dodge/parry/riposte are lower then Paladin/SK's'. <BR>Indeed, paladins/shadowknights got an increase to their reposte cap (200) where rangers stayed the same (150). In fact, I think we should have the riposte cap of warriors, as it's almost an offensive skill.<P>PLEASE! Remove the 30% mana tax on our spell… this goes for all hybrids. Our spells are outdated when we get them already, and we already have a smaller mana pool due to lower wis/int. Revert the mana pool to before its increase a few months back, and remove the 30% penalty.This tax creates extra downtime which FURTHER renders us ineffective and undesirable.  <BR>------ (if this is true then iam all for getting rid of it i mean we got no mana already and our spells are mana hogs with little dmg or affect or to short of time.)----<P><BR>One more thing don't discount a request or an idea because one person does not like it<BR>Another example " Rangers should get 1more mana point per level post 58"(no real affect and is no big deal right)" some says NOOOOOO that would make you uber and over powered you would be gods." <BR>	Then Abashi reads that someone has an idea then another does not like it he seems to leave it off his list or even talk about it..... Just look at them each your self don't just take the word of another poster for all you know it could be some Warrior trying to make ranger,pallies,SK lifes harder.....<P>Shadarlocoth Darkon the Ranger of Tunare<BR>49 season<BR>Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've been reading this thread with certain hope that the ranger class would at last be balanced before class balancing was "a closed matter". The growth rate of the thread and the insistence of most posters on certain matters tend to hint that there are certain issues that are wrong with rangers, mainly defense/taunt control, lack of a defining role/skill and a departure from the classic roleplay of a ranger in it's "one with nature" role, but most importantly, when the game forces players to group (high 40's up to 60 levels) the ranger falls way behind in desirability for groups and the game spirit and enjoyment for this class almost disappears.<BR>The posts here gave me some hope because they are certainly geared to improve ranger desirability in high level groups, but the faded feedback from Absor first (almost disrespectful), and the comments filtered from a live chat:<P>From Official EverQuest chat with Sony Online Entertainment February 7, 2001 4pm PST RPGPlanet lobby in GameSpy Arcade <BR>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt; *mOoK_* Recently it was stated that Ranger's Offensive skills were raised to the level of Warrior's, when all of the other hybrid's defensive skills were raised, why is that?

I guess my level 30 ranger will get to 49 but I don't think I will bother trying to go higher with him and will switch to a class I can play and enjoy past that level. Just a shame because the ranger was my first choice and I thought my only choice for a class...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This may be way out of line but how about a few more shaman spells to add to the rangers arsenal i mean pallies heal sk's can debuff somewhat why not give ranger a few even if lower level buffs.  As well maybe give them scale a wolf at 49 a spell that many feel is a waste of time which should be chagned to debuff only if you cast or attack not if you are attacked this change to scale would see it become a spell used in a spell book and not just used to even out your pages in your sepll book as a filler as it is now.<P>A spell that i feel a that rangers should be given to help out in this world of narrow passages is the spell shrink at level 39, this would not empower rangers any but make it easier for large races to get around in a game where 80 percent of the exp is gained in dungeons instead of always looking for shaman hey get that rng to shrink you.  Can you imagine a game where only one class could port or one class sould sow would be tell spam overload.<P>So to some it up spell wise more shaman spell to make rangers the buffer of a party of hybrids.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well this is something I haven't seen posted yet, although I haven't had a chance to read EVERY post.<P>Ok, I'm a big Ranger fan. The only other class I've spent much time on was a Wizard and I may yet use one as a secondary but I feel that Rangers, being hearty outdoorsmen, as we were discribed, should have Safefall. Now I know this is a Monk thing, but hear me out. <P>Everytime I run through the Oasis or Northern Ro, I usually have SoW on and find myself flying down the side of huge sand dunes, damaged, damage, damage, damage, ouch! Another instance, rinning around Black Burrow, one missed step and there goes a decent chunk of life (stepping into the snake pit from anything other than a ramp does a good job). Now, my justification needs to be clarified a bit here. I'm not saying we should be as good at it as monks are, definatly not, but we should be able to take a fall without hurting ourselves. I mean if we, as Rangers, get hurt just running through the environment we were designed for what use are we? So I purpose Safe fall with a lower cap (so we don't get folks jumping off the Wizard spires just for kicks, cause that SHOULD kill us) but enough to survive.<P>Another item. Hitpoints. I've seen alot of threads and posts saying Rangers should get more hitpoints and I'd like to agree. Frankly though after reading your responses to the other Ranger talk threads, I'd be perfectly happy to settle for that dodge/parry/defense increase you put on the list  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Just as a side note, kind of a general note for some classes here, armor. I'm happy with Ranger armor (recently switched to a Wood Elf Ranger cause they look ALOT cooler then those clunky half elves *L*) but I think there should be more. I mean We basically have 3 or 4 choices and thats it. So we get banded when we can afford it and wear it until Ivy etched, wear that until Thorny vine, etc. See where I'm going? Well I think we should have more choice, like Wizards and the magic wielding folks.

</FONT><HR>I play aranger who has a useless 200 tracking skill. most times when i hit track i don't even list the 10 mobs that are right around me even though it was said track will soon list from closest to furthest away.<P>Everyone said with expansion rangers will once again be lords of track. LOL and where still waiting druids and bards even thought there track skill is limted in the numbers. In actuall fact they will pick up mobs in abetter close radius.<P>Like in fear when i click trak most time my screen is swamped listing amy's not the 40 roamers that i have to pull to even get to the amy's.<P>The track by con was a great step but it works for all trackers not just rangers which is fine. Just need to fix the skill so that the other 150 skills points we have in trak actually mean something.<P>The scroll track idea was cool and the ability to change how our track lists stuff. Rangers main use of track is to track down rare pops for quest you should take the commands from the WHO function and work them into track so we can /track q in south karana this will list the mobs that start with q only. Another good funtion in these large zones is maybe /track cleric 39 60 this will list all the clerics in the zone making it easier to pull your body to them if you know where they are instead of 2 million /loc commands.<P>Should rangers be allowed to track bodies of group members even though there in the same zone. YES what the diff if the group member is in the same zone. Can they track people like a necro NO a ranger can track only group members that died why grouped cause they have there sent lets say. <P>The big one why can't a ranger track his own body i mean if anyone thing they know their own tracks and scent(no matter how much they need a bath)<P><BR>PS. when will track stop changing screen views on us in full screen mode</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

On the 50+ problems i cannot comment.<P>1.  Please fix our tracking as it's embarassing for me too have to run to the other side of a zone to pick up something that was  right next to me to track it correctly.<P>2.  Archery is so far little more than a novelty than a staple as to what symbolizes a ranger.  It hurts to burn 5pp in arrows on a mob and get 2cp in loot.<P>3. Charm animal. Please dont. i dont want it, i dont need it. My hands are full enough without having to deal with a pet. Per the arguement of the RP standpoint the animals we could charm would be in newbie zones mostly and i just dont envision any 50+ rangers shouting out the the zone "come look at my pet bear and listen to my tales" not gonna happen. Fear yes. By the Gods i am a force to be reckoned with and i think that the animals should know all about it.<P>Everything i could say about the defense, offense, HP issue would be redundant at this point, but please make me something that i can bring to a group other than a great puller that can bring em back just in time to get a full heal.<P>35 ranger<BR>7th Hammer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Alan:<P>1.  You said that the logic is flawed on removing disarm because it doesn't 'free up' skill points.  You need to listen to what the complaint is:<P>a.  The disarm skill for rangers is viewed as having marginal use.  In truth, it only affects the 20% or so of monsters that visibly have a weapon (nothing happens otherwise).  And certain classes skill cap prevent it from working v. the 'magic boundary' (unless your skill closely compares to the monsters defense skill and/or level, you find yourself failing way to often to bother.  Although not all spells are 'A-list' spells and not a skills are 'A-list' skills, you want to feel that everytime you cast a spell and everytime you use a skill it has an effect.<P>Simply put, Disarm lacks that sense of 'impacting' the combat.  If the NPC had skill in a weapon and was visibly superior with it v. just hitting with fists AND a ranger had a reasonable chance of disarming, then it would make sense to propose keeping the skill.  As it is, it makes more sense to 'clean up' the skill list, admit skills with low skill numbers seem to have minimal impact, and start with a fresh slate.  That logic is solid and makes sense from a game design perspective doesn't it??<P>2.  Arguably Evade and Jolt should be of similar effect but not exact same effect or mechanism.  Similarly, it wouldn't hurt for Jolt to kick in as low as 30th level when the chain v. plate armor discrepancy begins to show up.  Again, the reason for Evade and Jolt is to manage the 'magic boundary' where high enough AC v. monster level causes a MAJOR decrease in damage taken apparently regardless of armor type (chain, plate, leather).  Evade/Jolt/Feign Death thus become hate-list management tools v. an AI that is stunningly stu....errr...simple.  It makes for fun gameplay, so don't worry about making the AI more...subtle...or...complex (stupid in bigger ways).<P><BR>The logic that is being used is that if you give a skill that is of marginal usefulness at a skill cap that makes it even MORE marginal in its usefulness, and THEN you count that as a real skill against the class (see Jan 2000 rogue arguments with Gordon on PRECISELY the same subject regarding "useless" skills like diarm traps</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi, <BR>This message is not really on the much needed Ranger Balancing needed in the game but rather the expectations of the class from a new player stand point and the wish that these expectations be better met. While considering the balancing of rangers, please consider the following.<P>1)Rangers typically in D&D should be the best scouts bar none, please improve this ability, ie. give ITU, or make hide work better.<P>2)Archery - should be equal to backstab damage but more reliable at higher skills.. at skill 180 I still miss 40% of the time and takes me over 60 arrows to kill a blue conned rooted mob on flat surface. The downtime making arrows is too much a penalty for this kind of bow performance. Make a bow equal to a slow 2hs. A FS 2hs sword at skill of 120 is more damage and more reliable damage.<P>3)My pre-concieved D&D impression of a Ranger in battle is a damage dealing hard to hit warrior. Make AGI actaully make a difference. Make it so that over 150 agi for Ranger gives a marked improvement for dodge and parry and reposte. IE Give the Ranger a choice either all str gear for damage dealing or all AGI gear for better defense. Possible make a weight limit kinda like monks have but higher. Ranger = constant damage output with crit's related to reposte. If AGI and or Skills high enough dodge actually would help alot. We shouldn't have to worry about high AC or high HP if we are really hard to hit.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Greetings,<P>Well it seems that everyone has mention things that need to be address. I have just a couple here to mention. <BR>First, I would like to mention, I know you are working on it, but PLEASE fix our tracking. It seems to be taking a back seat with all these other changes. <BR>Now for the other issues:<BR>I do believe our spells need a little change. <BR>Our Dismiss Summon series, we should have the next line of this series Banish Summon. It will be consistent with what we have. I also believe Chloroplast or Greater Healing should be drop to 53 or 52. We need help from 51 to 55, till we get jolt. <BR>I know you have said this before that bows will not be a main attack form, but why not? If rangers can dish out a significant amount of damage with bows it would add another dimension to the game and help define their roles much better. If rangers can attack from a distance with bows and spells then they dont need to worry about tanking or low ac or low defense. Their job would be to dish out damage then when the NPC is low on health come in and finish the job by melee. I believe you should reconsider your stand with bows.<BR>I have more but I believe most have been covered by the rest, these seem to be most important well to me at least.<P>FIX OUR TRACKING!!!!!<P>Thank you<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I would like to add some archery suggestions. Rangers are the one class that should have some very important and distinct Improvements on Archery over other classes.<P>1) Why was not a Bow Epic made? I mean truly this is the defining trait of a Ranger!? At the very least we should be able to turn in our Epic Blades to continue a quest to get an Epic Bow...one that would put all others to shame...AND Rangers would have to choose between keeping the blades or going for the Epic Bow....they could NOT have both : )<P>2) Why is Archery capped at all for a Ranger? Should be able to reach full skill on this one.<P>3) Archery needs to be made the defining skill of Rangers if they choose to use it. If we get the MOBs attention even now with it they can summon or come after us....I would rather see tweaks made to the taunt of arrow damage and make it at least effective. There is always a trade off to be made so maybe this is one way.<P>4) Trueshot Discipline was a GREAT addition but it still needs some twinking to make it viable. If it is "Trueshot" then our aim and ability to make the hard and high damage shots should be there. It is blocked by people and pets all the time.<P>5) Fix Line of Sight (yes I know its been said but it is IMPORTANT!) maybe line of sight could be tied to archery skill level so that the higher the level the less line of sight you need. I do not know if it is possible but it is a solution!<P>I am sure I missed some other ideas I had but these are some of theones i feel are important. Archery really is the biggest defining trait of a ranger and yet as people have said before it can be useless a lot of the time.....not good for a defining skill.....<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Is this intentional? I'm not sure why, but if it's not, it's something that would make a big difference to this spell. (going from used once in a great while, to using it all the time)<P>Strength of Nature not stacking with Divine strength, Grim Aura and This new paladin hp buff? Not stacking with grim aura isn't a huge deal. If it wasn't intentional, then sure I could see it being useful for them to stack.<P>I think the ranger and paladin buffs should stack for several reasons. The main reason is that with the 15 buff limitation, you can only stack so much. Depending on the situation and the presence of a bard, it's very easy to eat up those 15 slots as it is. With all these new buffs, it adds a great deal of variety and forces players to chose from a larger pool than before. Kind of like the old dilema with robes. SMR was your best bet as a caster and everyone wanted it. Now casters have a much wider variety of robes to chose from instead of having to fight over the 'single best' robe in the game. (not including planar)<P>Another reason for them to stack would be from an RP point of view. The sources for the paladin and ranger spells are different! Paladins call upon the holy powers of godly might! Rangers call upon the natural forces around them!<P><BR>3. I CAN'T CARRY ENOUGH ARROWS! Please reference this thread: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/051295.html<P><BR>4. NEW PLANAR GEAR? We have one item (helm - tunare only) in the new planes released with SoV..... Same with paladins and druids. Why? If PoM will have druid, paladin, ranger armor please tell me there will be much more in the zone to attract other classes. Right now PoM is THE most difficult zone in the game to get to. Especially compared to PoG which is incredibly easy to get to and farm.<P><BR>5. SELF ILLUSION SPELL Instead of Wolf Form and Greater Wolf form, could we have Panther Form instead? I think the panther seems to reflect the rangers stealthy hunter spirit more than the wolf. Wolves hunt in packs, panthers go solo. It would also be nice to distinguish a ranger from a druid in their animal forms. Also, instead of the attack buff, maybe give a lesser attack buff, along with a dex buff.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The things I feel still require change regarding the Ranger class are as follows:<P>1) INCREASE RANGER DEFENSE SKILL TO 230 FROM 200.<P>REASON: Since Knights (and Bards) have had their Defense increased to 252 and Rangers have had their Offense increased to 252, and therefore Knights defend and Rangers offend almost as well as Warriors, I feel that a Ranger should defend as well as Knights offend. Therefore I think it is appropriate that a Ranger’s Defense skill (currently locked at the pre-RoK value of 200) should be increased to 230, which is the current Knight Offense skill cap. Knights will still maintain a significant AC advantage, both with regard to Avoidance and Mitigation, including approximately 300-350 more HP. I do not think that this position rationally can be argued down other than by an arbitrary prejudice. Rangers clearly need assistance in Defense, and balancing a Ranger’s Defense against a Knight’s Offense strikes parity between them. Rangers remain the “Offensive Hybrid” and Knights remain “Defensive Hybrids.” This fix (and it is a fix) just allows Rangers slightly better to defend themselves, about as well as Knights are offensively.<P>Defense pre-RoK: RNG/PAL/SHD/WAR = 200/200/200/210<BR>Defense RoK: RNG/PAL/SHD/WAR = 200/252/252/252 (per Test)<BR>Proposed Defense: RNG/PAL/SHD/WAR = 230/252/252/252<P>PAL/SHD RoK Offense = 230<P>The parity here is appropriate and not overpowering.<P>WAR = RNG = 252 Offense<BR>WAR = PAL/SHD = 252 Defense<BR>RNG Defense = PAL/SHA Offense = 230<P>2) INCREASE RANGER RIPOSTE SKILL TO 175 FROM 150.<P>REASON: When Kunark was release, Rangers received zero defensive increases. It was seen later on that this was a mistake. Our Dodge and Parry were increased, therefore, to the same proportions, as they existed with respect to Warriors pre-RoK. But Riposte was not increased, whereas the Knights’ were. Since both Warriors and Knights received 25 skill points in Riposte with RoK, it is felt that Rangers should also have received those additional points.<P>Riposte pre-RoK: RNG/PAL/SHD/WAR = 150/175/175/200<BR>Riposte RoK: RNG/PAL/SHD/WAR = 150/200/200/225<BR>Proposed Riposte: RNG/PAL/SHD/WAR = 175/200/200/225<P>3) ARCHERY ISSUES:<P>SUGGESTIONS:<P>A) Increase Archery skill cap to 252 from 240. There is no good reason that a Ranger should have the same cap as a Warrior.<BR>B) Grant Archery a Damage Modifier similar to the Primary Weapon Damage Modifier. It is unfathomable to me how a 28 DMG bow with 8 DMG arrows can hit for 1 DMG.<BR>C) Consider Double Attack with a Bow, or perhaps Double Attack with Discipline Trueshot.<P>4) HYBRID SPELL STACKING ISSUES. <P>SUGGESTION: It is unfathomable why Verant developed some very nice, unique and beneficial Hybrid-only spells, yet these spells do not stack with each other or with the most common Haste buffs in the Augment-line. Paladin Divine Strength does not stack with Ranger Strength of Nature, and Ranger Call of Earth does not stack with the Augment-line. Please reevaluate these Hybrid spells.<P>5) MODIFY/CHANGE JOLT RESIST RATE OR GIVE IT A SKILL CHECK.<P>SUGGESTION: Jolt’s resist rate or resistance check needs to be changed. It is currently highly resistible and utterly useless on Velious. On Kunark, however, Jolt works fine. Perhaps change Jolt to require a skill check as Evade does, and not a resist. In any case, Jolt needs to be looked at.<P>6) EPICS<P>SUGGESTION: Consider making the Ranger Epics usable in either hand, as the Warrior Epics are. The Ranger Epics are currently restricted.<P>7) UPGRADE TO FEET LIKE CAT.<P>SUGGESTION: Perhaps create a stackable AGI buff unique to Rangers, or at least an upgrade to Feet Like Cat.<P>Anaxagoras<BR>60 Ranger<BR>&lt;The Harmonium&gt;<BR>Xev<P><BR>/boggle</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor.  Look at this comparision.  Paly's and SK's both have 230 offense and 252 defense.  Rangers have 200 defense, and 252 offense.  Please raise Ranger's defense to be on par with the other hybrids offense.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055872-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055872.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055872-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055872-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055872-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055872-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055872&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055872&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
