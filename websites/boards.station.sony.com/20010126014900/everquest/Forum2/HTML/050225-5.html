&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Greetings!<P>I am glad to see this post and all of the contributions that have been offered here.  There are some great ideas that have inspired me to comment and add as appropriate below.  Forgive me if I cover any ground already discussed or omit any ideas previously mentioned.<P>BACKGROUND:<BR>I have played my druid to level 39 through over 80 days of /played time.  I'm a casual player and enjoy fishing as much as anything else.  Oddly enough, fishing and alcohol tolerance have both increased at the same time and are both maxed at the moment - hehe.<P>I have also played DnD and ADnD since thier beginning and have played in GenCon tournaments for many years.  I understand the concepts behind the huge tasks of creating worlds while making them challenging and fun.<P>GENERAL IDEAS:<BR>* My druid is completely untwinked.  I see no need for uber-gear that I did not earn.  I enjoy pursuing the gear with friends and grouping to meet new friends.  My friend list has moved to paper long ago.  hehe.  Unfortunately, so has my ignore list.<P>* The biggest problem that I have is camps.  I do not have the time to sit in UGuk for 30 hours waiting to combat the MOB that might drop the components I need to finish the Paw of Opalla quest.  Invariably, there is a high-level character parked there with thier pet guarding the spawn point.  Trying to get that camp is insanely difficult.  (My 44 warrior has the same problem with the FBSS and trying to get that camp for the last 9 levels - lol - there is usually a high-level mage or necro camping it to sell it).<P>* I do not disagree with anyone's motivation to play this game.  I just find the VI logic difficult to understand.  If grouping is the focus, then why is loot sellable?  All loot should be NODROP and sellable to merchants only in my opinion and allow the trade-skill items and merchant wares to be fully sellable.  I will never see 40,000 plat in my account as a druid.  Indeed, among the level 60 friends that I have, only the mages, necros, and a few twinks can claim that bank balance.  So be it - again, I do not complain here.  I chose the poverty and natural focus of the druid and could roll up a necro easily to fund stuff.  But my point is grouping.  If grouping truly is the focus of VI's intent, then sellable treasure will only encourage the higher level soloing classes to camp that particular treasure to sell and twink thier alternates.  (with a 20% turnover in subscriptions for EQ, it is simple logic that 80% are staying and trying new class/race combinations - but the difficulty in the new class/race encourages that 80% to twink thier alternate with gear that drops from 60th level mobs - I know this is true because I have seen it)<P>* Each of us has a limited right to play this game in a matter that we enjoy without making it unenjoyable for others.  If a person focuses on loot or levelling or fishing, it is completely up to them.  I state this only because I do not want my words above to taken out of context or spirit.<P>DRUID SPECIFIC IDEAS:<BR>* The druid is finely tuned to the forces of nature.  He or she draws upon that force for the accomplishment of a task.  If we are to compare the druid to the other priest classes (shaman and cleric), we must also understand that thier magical sources originate elsewhere.  The Cleric relies upon the force that his or her diety blesses them with and the Shaman upon the herbs and chants that call the assistance of spirits to accomplish a goal.<P>* In the Dungeons and Dragons world, the druid is the traveller and the one most closely related to nature.  To travel, the druid would open up tunnels in the undergrowth of a thick forest enabling his or her group to walk at a regular movement rate through them.  This is accomplished in EverQuest with SoW, levitate, camo, and TPs as they assist in guiding the druid's group to and from any point.<P>With this in mind then, I offer the following ideas that can be implemented.  These ideas should meet 2 criteria in my opinon.<BR>1 - ideas should not make any other class less effective<BR>2 - ideas should not make the druid more desireable<P>Here they are:<BR>* Druids should have the ability to summon any aninmal pet in the zone. Indoors or out, if there is an animal there, the druid knows it.  This pet should stay with the druid for the duration that the druid is in that zone and once dismissed, simply goes away.  Perhaps it attacks the druid or just poofs.  That really does not matter.  But the balance is that the druid would need a non-stackable material component (mistletoe was used in ADnD to enhance the power of all druid spells) and, the druid should suffer some sort of ability hit to offset thier concentration on maintaining thier pet.  Perhaps a substantial reduction in wisdom or dropping the moverate to precisely that of thier pet.  This would make pet choices a bit more thought provoking and reduce the ability to pet-quad-kite or some other rediculous solo strategy while not making the kiting ability completely useless.  Druids often kite excess mobs off thier groups as a sort of needed crowd-control in the absence of an enchanter.<P>* Druids should have the ability to completely heal a group member (not just any target) and, optionally, only outdoors.  But the complete heal should not be the same as the cleric's because the channeled forces have different origins.  Let the Druid completely heal a group member by casting this spell on a sitting member only.  During a period of say 2 minutes, neither the druid nor the target will be able to move, cast other spells, or be effected by PC spells of beneficial value (NPC spell attacks should be more or less effective as well as PvP attacks).  The idea is illustrated by considering a visual of the druid conjuring the natural plantlife to encompass and surround the injured target and heal it with it's essence.  Essentially rooted, the target must take no action during the healing process and the druid must maintain his or her concentration on the channelling of this power.<P>* Rooting something means just that.  Rooted.  Certainly do not remove the other casters' ability to root a target but allow the druids to have a much more effective one.  One that has no chance to break every round but one that still suffers the chance to break on a direct damage spell.  Leave ensnare the way it is but allow it to overwrite everyone elses snares and slows.  Give the druid value in this area and he or she will be a saught out addition to every group.<P>* As a being tuned to nature, the druid should know and be proficient with travel.  Every zone and every nook and cranny should be explored.  This idea involves the person at the keyboard to do just that and learn to be the guide for thier groups.  No spells are needed here, only the commitment of the player to actually learn the zones.  Perhaps making camo and sup camo less random would help, but hearing constant whines in the zone asking where is that or this from druids simply embarrasses me as a druid roleplayer.  I usually tell them to camo up and explore and have spent many hours teaching the loc system to those that wanted.  But the ability to take on another form does much in the way toward accomplishing this as I cover in the next idea.<P>* For the roleplay, and the travel, allow the druid to take on the form of any animal in the current zone and allow that form to remain such as long as the PC remains in that zone.  If a snake is normally attacked by the guards in West Freeport, then the druid should be attacked if in that form.  Likewise, if the druid is of sufficient level to defeat his attacker, then perhaps the snake will win once in a while.  And if the scouts in Firiona Vie do not normally attack a leech, then the KOS druid has a tool to gain entry there. Some things see through camo, but others might be indifferent to wasp form.  Allow the druid to explore and learn when and where to strategically take that self-illusion on.  There are many options for this spell to provide some fun as well as travelling strategies and keyboard education beneficial to the druids' group.<P>SUMMARY:<BR>The druid can be a useful class in any group that he or she wishes to be a part of.  Some people, like myself, are casual players and not bold enough to ask for a group when we only have an hour or so to play.  Making the druid a desireable class to have in a group by augmenting and not replacing other benefits found in other classes goes a long way to achieve this goal.  I might add that druids also should wear robes as the druids do in DnD but the look of the druid is not as important as his or her contribution to the success of the group.  Allow the druid to be the prince of nature again but the king of nothing and the druid will remain an option for the player and not an uber-class.<P>Peace all.  I know many of you will be inclined to flame me and, quite honestly, I and others skip past those whines anyway so go nuts.  I simply play a game that enjoy and offer some ideas to make one aspect of it more fun.<P>Bearsoul Shadewhisper<BR>Cazic-Thule<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>For Balance:<P>*HEALING - Improving healing for druids (and maybe shamen) is to improve effectiveness of healing with more hp healed and more importantly imho, faster casting of it.  The clerics will always have the ultimate healing that druids and shaman can't touch - its called resurrection.<P>*MOB AGGRO - Druids get stomped and killed in milliseconds when casting their heal spells, which frequently  makes the mobs super-aggro on them.  There are a number of reasons and ways to fix this, improving defense abilities of druids (take your pick how) and/or reducing the mob aggro response to healing, are just two examples.<P>*MANA REGENERATION - Getting this mana dependent class some regeneration would certainly help everyone - we've got to have it.  Multiple classes can port, though druids can't port to planes.  Multiple classes already mana regen, though druids cannot.  Multiple classes have SoW or sow like speed buffs, though the druid sow is not the fastest speed buff.  I suggest clarity potions which will benefit everyone, just as sow potions do.  Though my preference is for a spell such as treeform or something to include mana regen., or both.<P>*UNIQUE LOOK - Thanks for the velious armor that finally gives the druids (and everyone else) some gear that lets us step out from our old newbie pajama's.  I cannot understate the yearning we druids have for more choice in the look of our gear. This is something that can be provided without unbalancing anything. Can we have some more please?  <P>For example: A nice staff with nice stats on it should look like more than a wood pole - How about different versions of the wooden crook look...with different orbs on the end of the stick.  Even different colors on stuff would be nice.<P>*Forms - Shouldn't Greater Wolf look like a greater wolf?  How about scaling up the size of the greater wolf to giant size?  I'ld like to see Treant form just because it would be so cool - how about it?<P>*Pets - why should any animal be aggro to a druid - charm or no charm - this has been source of aggravation for every druid.  When charmed, let the darn things wander off when the spell drops.<P>*NEW PORT LOCATIONS - I've heard mixed results from druids as to wanting a port in Surefall. Some want it remote, others want something closer to Qeynos. IFF you were to put a port in Surefall, I've always felt the tall tress above the Jaggedpine temple sure looked like they had room for some hard to get to rooms.  How about a port up in tree that you have to levitate down from?   <P>West Karanas near Qeynos might be a better location for a port, afterall, if Qeynos is one of the oldest cities...you'ld think they'd have a port nearby.  Same goes for Halas.  Kunark could use another outdoor ring and circle accessible from anywhere, not just a dungeon.<P>*The Nerfs - Nothing.  Though I would trade a small reduction in how long snare lasts for improvements in healing and mana regeneration if it reduces the flames.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>1) Great idea there earlier. there are zones with druid rings that have no tp to them. how about giving us spells to them?  No new zone geometry needed then correct? And please for the love of god a Surefall glade area tp.<P>2)Spell drops, I have spent weeks straight now with groups and solo to get my 39th level Ro's fiery sundering to drop from a rare mob. I am 42nd level and seemingly don't stand a chance.  PLease either make level spells drop more or from a greater amount of mobs in that level range. Seems ridiculous to have to wait til I can go to 50+ level areas to get comparitively low level spells.<P>3) The biggest druid issue in the game. post 10th level to pre 50th level there is almost no content in game for druids.  Other classes have armor or item quests with involved storylines. for druids there is practically nothing and what is there is ridiculous (and cheap) for the levels you need to attain them.<P>4) Mana regen: we should NOT have an ability like that in a spell. I would suggest a manastone type item that is only usable by classes that DO NOT have that capability in a spell form.  No complaining about healing loops either you already allow shamans regen and cannabalize. DRU CLR only.<P>5)Not to sure on this healing issue. I personally don't believe in the any two others can make up one character class.  No group of classes even exceeding 2 can replace one enchanter.  Maybe improve how often our spells work without upping their potential.<P>6)More group spells please. Dreg up that group invis spell again, Group Lev would be nice, The more group spells you give us the more grouping we will do, At least one would like to think so anyway  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>7)I personally love the idea of non aggroing charmed animals.  I do not use charm aninals as it seems ridiculous to me to have to kill natural creatures as a druid.  Make it so that the craeture has a higher chance to resist upon recasts so that the mob does not beome a permanent pet.  This would seem inline with balance and with rping.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>“First I want to ask you all to keep within the generally existing mechanics. We’re looking for balance, but I’m not going to bring a dozen new spell ideas to the team as a balance tool… And, realistically, we have to keep the ideas to things that won’t require a team of artists and programmers to create.” – Alan. <P>My fellow druids… Lets humor VI for a bit. If we want changes with Druids we will have to stick to the rules set. <P>1. No graphic changes. <BR>2. Nothing that will imbalances the other classes.<BR>3. Make everyone happy.<BR>4. Good point of mine. Nothing that will involve too much of a large group of people and meeting that takes time, and time is $$$. But if we gada make it fair lets do it right.<P>Lets first off talk about the other classes out there intruding on druids “right” to a spell or just a general imbalance.<P>1. Shamans, Form of the Great Bear. This adds too many stats and stacks with other buffs. What’s Wrong with that you ask?<BR>a.	Druids have been asking for bear form longer than shamans.<BR>b.	It can be cast in doors.<BR>c.	Multi-bear graphics. Polar bear Black bear etc.<BR>d.	It’s a ‘form’ spell thus stacks with all buffs. A shaman can be 1. Barbarian 2. Ogre 3. Troll 4. Iksar. All these races already have natural exaggerated Stats.<BR>e.	Do Enchanters get this ‘form’ spell? “Other new forms aren’t gonna fly (heh, good pun). As I’ve said before, I’d much rather advocate the use of any free space for giving enchanters more forms.” – Alan. I’ve checked and Enchanters don’t get this ‘form’.<BR>f.	I wont go into how much mana this takes for a shaman to cast V.S. Wolf Form, or about the other fun things that go on like that fizzle rate base mana etc …<BR>2. There are many more Shaman/Cleric Items that add the main kicker stats that druids and all wis casters want and that’s ac, wis, dex, agil, and sta. Don’t get me wrong most of those items feed into the chain/plate category and Druids cant use those items. For the most part, but what’s fair is fair no?<BR>a.	Froglok scale Tunic + wis stats ac etc<BR>b.	Emerald DS Bp +20 wis and other stats <BR>c.	All the shaman spears that add wis + other stats. <BR>d.	Druids don’t get Scimitars that add wis. Except the one made by the smith skills. + 1 maybe 2 wis with other dumbed-down stats that are truly low-mid level.<P>3. Oldie but a goodie. Lets see some quest armor. The excuse for all other classes getting it because it is replacing Rubicite isn’t a serviceable explanation anymore. Sense the random drops of these armor parts in Najena, and on other occasion’s elsewhere. Thus its in game but only appears on rare events.<P>Thank you for coming out to the real people who play the game to ask what they think. Everyone has his or her follies and flaws but getting past that will be the first step to helping everyone achieve enthusiasm about Everquest.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Although a druid is not my main character I do have one at level 51.  Her primary role is tax and power level support which is a shame.  She was a valued member of a party through level 40, maybe even through the mid 40s. What happened??<P>I have read as many of these posts as possible and everyone seems to think that a couple of healing spells will fix everything.  I think the issue is a little deeper, especially if you want to keep the uniqueness of the druid in tact.<P>A druid for most of their life [assuming you don't get tremendous enjoyment from kiting stupid non-intelligent MOBs around in circles] has a good role in a group:<P>1) Shields -- skin line.<BR>2) Healing [direct heals, poison/desease heals and regen]<BR>3) Str buffs<BR>4) SOW<BR>5) Dam Shields<BR>6) Shared Wolf Form [great buff for tanks]<BR>7) Resist buffs<BR>8) Nukes<BR>9) DOTS<BR>10) Snare, Root<P>A druid could be summoned up as a secondary healer, with good blasts, great dam shields, nice DOTs, SOW and Shared Wolf Form.<P>A little bit of everything, plus SOW and Shared Wolf Form.<P>After 50 the problem is a relative one.<P>1) healing, the gap in a cleric and druids healing ability goes from large to huge in the plus 50+ game.  A level 60 druid couldn't even keep one tank alive in a real fight.  So I agree with everyone that SH at 49 and something a little better at mid 50 would get things back on track.<P>2) Regen.  This line of spells is also not increasing in proportion to the damage and total hit points of a highend tank.  But its close.<P>3) SOW/Shared Wolf.  The restriction of this to outdoors had the effect to keep druids a bit more outddors than indoors.  However, in the post 44 game groups and multigroup activities tend to force you indoors a lot more.  Hence this line of spells is tremendously devalued.  I think that there should be a pair of post 50 spells, one a SOW upgrade and one a Shared Wolf Upgrade.  This pair should both be castable indoors, last longer than the current ones and survive zoning.  This is what makes a druid a druid [or at least one of the most associated things with druids, puppys and SOW]<P>4) Damage Shields begin to lose there effectiveness in the post 50 game.  The mobs are hitting harder and harder, but the dam shield is not raising in proportion.  The dam shield has always been most effective on fast hitting MOBs that hit for small amounts.  But when MOBs start to hit for 300+ even the a 32 dam shield is not doing much.  I would suggest having two post 50 dam shields both of which are percentage based.  I.e. a 15% dam shield would do 30 damage if a mob hit you for 200.<P>So, in summary:<P>Move SH to 49 and and a better heal at mid 50.<P>Add a upgrade to SOW and Shared wolf in the 50s that can be cast indoors and lasts longer.<P>Change the post 50 dam shields to be % based.<P>Maybe lookminto the regen line and see if it is improving in line with a a tanks typical damage in hps.<P>None of this takes anything away from other classes, it just says keep the druid being a druid.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Suggestions<P>1) Increase healing abilities. <P>SH at 49th and something better later on. There are lots of good suggestions on this topic.<P>2) Move the dropped spells from Velious down to creatures that are of a comparable level. <P>Why should we have to kill level 50+ creatures to get a 39th level spell? a 39th level spell is of no value to me if I cannot cast it until I'm 50+. BTW, I'm 50th level and still can't get the 39th spells from Velious. A spell's level defines when it becomes available and limits it's usefulness. By putting them on 53rd level creatures, you might as well make the spell a 50th level spell or higher. It's very upsetting to get to 39th level anxiously awaiting your new spells only to find that 2 or 3 of them are on creatures that could kill you and your group in record time.<P>3) Fix the Charm plant spell. <P>It will not charm a 30th level plant and it's a 29th level quest spell (that requires a 40th level group to complete....see above for Velious similarity) If the spell is going to be that crappy, at least put it on a vendor instead of making people spend time on a quest to obtain a "show and tell" spell) Will it even charm a treant? They're only 25th level or so.<P>4) Give us a group treeform spell for fun.<P>I think there was a version in beta called "Forest". I'm not sure why it was trashed(if it existed at all) but please reimplement it for the treehuggers in all of us. Treeform has been modified much since release. Trees can no longer walk and treeform only works in certain outdoor locales so I can't think of any way to "abuse" it.<P>5) Add a druid teleport to Surefall Glades.<P>From a roleplaying standpoint, it's a druid/ranger zone for heaven's sake. It makes perfect sense to have a port there with all the trees and power of nature that flows in that place. From a gameplay standpoint, it would be nice for everyone if there were a port out west. Permafrost would certainly get alot more activity.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>QUOTE: "Absor-<BR>First I'll say that I am a level 40 Druid and I really do not think we need better healing spells. To do so would be, in my opinion, "nerfing the Clerics". Clerics are designed to be primary healers and Druids/Shamans are secondary healers that's the way it is. Looking at fizzle rates and maybe reducing casting time is would be a good idea or maybe even a self only heal that is equal to a Clerics (given out at level 49+) That way a Cleric wont have to worry about Druids as much during epic battles and can concentrate on the Tanks. If you do increase Druid/Shaman healing powers...be ready for a bunch of angry Clerics and happy Druids/Shamans (some of which are probaly unhappy with me  right now).

</FONT><HR>Hello, the thing I would like you to check is the regeneration spells. Druids and shamans were the masters of those spells and it ws making up for their lack in direct healing, but since Kunark, clerics now have better regen spells, wich in my mind is not god for class balance, since they are now seen as the only class who can heal effectively in high level encounters, and heck, we are still healers  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">! Also, in uber encounters our direct damages spells are useless as they are resisted, neither can we heal since our healing spells arent powerful enough... The only thing we can do is share wolf form and try to keep cleric alive if things go bad... I feel our utility in uber encounters is lowered. Well I might be wrong due to my relativly small experience in such encounters, but thats how i feel.<P>The next thing I would like too see changed isn't too much of class balance... I would like it if a robe graphic could be done for halflings/wood elves/half elves, so the nice robes druids can wear are not only restricted to human druids, wich are only a minority in druid population...<P>Well that's all, hope you'll read this (oh and sorry for my english, tried my best =P)...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

We receive upgrades to all of our forms off offense including; direct damage, area effect, point blank area effect, and rain spells.

</FONT><HR>Well i don't have time to read all of the previous posts..but read enough to know what others are talking about.  I'm currently lvl 59 and have become bored to death of my druid.  If i can even get a group (yay evac's), the only thing i can do in a group is a crappy heal that will fizzle about half the time, a fire or ice dd that will land for half more often than not, or dot that will use about half of its duration before a mob is dead.  Since druids are apparently a priest class, it only makes sense to upgrade their healing.  I would like to be included on a raid for something other than porting ppl out when its over. Druids have the lowest ac of the "priest" classes by far, have the poorest looking equipment, can't buff during a raid, can't heal after its started to matter, and more often than not will be resisted if they try to nuke.  An improvement to any of these areas would be a great boon.  I stuck with a druid for so long because it was fun to play, at higher levels its lost most of its luster because the only new things i can do is stop the rain (after a 5 minute load of the spell), make a bear pet (admittedly fun but weak), and soon at 60 a group hp buff.  So far the group hp buff was the most useful thing i've seen added to the druid class in either expansion.  If druids could do something that other classes couldn't, give us new buffs that stack with other classes, new heal of some sort, make a dot useful on a raid encounter, new nukes that will land on an uber-creature, and please please make scale of wolf not drop when something casts on you.....*not the same as you casting on something*  Any of these would be great, but i think the main thing a druid is lacking at higher lvls is something new....much the same problem as many other classes have (disciplines were a huge boon to the melee game).<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This to Hamrok:<P>Yes, a druid's ability to solo well DOES INDEED contribute to evidence that they are balanced, and I'll tell you why.<P>Other classes are judged as "balanced" because of their in-ability to solo.  I'm speaking specifically about clerics and enchanters, who are pathetic without a group.<P>People PLAY druids specifically for their ability to get along just fine without a group!  Now that the shoe is on the other foot and the high level game is harder, what are the solo players whining about?<P>This is what they wanted.<P>The fact is that druids DO contribute to a group.  They contribute a ton of utility.  They're just not PERFECT at healing, but they're better than necros and paladins at it.<P>Druids don't get denied planar raids for lack of ability to contribute.  They get denied because they're so common that they've already got more than they need.<P>Does the expression "a dime a dozen" seem appropriate?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I play a ranger in a small roleplaying guild on the nameless.  My guild has 1 Cleric.  Thats right 1 cleric.  If we want to do a hunt we have to rely on a druid or shaman to take his place if he is not around.  With the fizzle rate of Sup Heal and the mana/hp cost Shaman and druids are not viable healers post 50.<P>I understand clerics are the "healers" but what all of us who play this game come to realize is that our friends the druids and shamans can't fill the same role they did for 45 or so levels and it severely hamstrings the enjoyment you can receive from playing when you have to spend 2 hrs finding a cleric or another spot to hunt because you don't have one.<P>For crying out loud, give druids and shaman a HoT (Heal over Time) that heals 3000 hp for 500 mana over a reasonable duration of like 10 secs. Give it a casting time of 8 secs. Give it a recast time of 15 secs so it cannot be used as the sole healing method for battle by casting it just prior to a fight.  Make them able to heal reasonable because its keep us all from enjoying the game as it was intended.<P>Deral</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>-Moved Superior to 51, lower fizzle rate.  Let's face it folks, mobs post 50 hit too damn hard.  And maybe a slightly better/mana efficient one at 55.<P>-Add some more debuffs perhaps.  Druids are supposed to be jack of all trades and the only thing that I've seen most people suggest is better healing so far.  Fixation of Ro is kick ass, and not very unbalancing.  Maybe add another one to make us alittle more group friendly, or a higher lvl version at 55 or so.  <P>-DoT's/Nukes are good, no need to work on them.  Pretty decent, but not the best.  Works as intended.<P>-Utility/buff spells that last longer.  Again, not too unbalancing,  but i think will make most druids happy.<P>-More quests/gear.  Not gonna happen, but you can always wish.<P>I understand that people may get upset at these changes, but you have your own discussion about what you need.  All classes need some fixing, so let's try not step on each other to get to the top, but instead, all come out on top.

Recovery without a cleric is impossible.<P>I'd suggest adding a high level shaman/druid resurrection effect with a LONG downtime afterwards.

</FONT><HR>Seems to me that there are 2 major areas that druids are ineffective in.  Healing and Mana.  <P>As a level 56 druid the main reason I see us having trouble to get groups has to do with healing.  Move supior healing down to level 44.  Create a new heal spell for 54 that is stronger then supior healing but not a complete heal.  Make this spell available to clerics and shamen as well.  This improves a clerics healing abilities as well as the other healing classes without anyone feeling like clerics have been nerfed out in the process.  <P>For mana lets adjust the tree form series and add a new tree form around level 39.  All tree form spells should offer both hp and mana regen at the price of being rooted.  My suggestion for mana regen would be at rates of 2/4/6 for each version of the spell.  i.e. mana regen of 2 at the lowest level and 6 at the highest.  This is based on the idea that we are basicly absorbing substance from our connection to the earth by being in tree form.  Since treeform is already an outdoor only ability this shouldn't impact an enchanters role in a group significanly enough for them to be offended by it.  <P>As far as teleport go, the only one I have ever had trouble with is the lack of a teleport closer to surefall when we have 2 teleports to the karana plains.  Instead of making a new spell why can't we change to location that succor east takes us to, have that drop us in surefall.  Actually there is one other issue here, why the heck isn't there a self only port to combine (dreadlands)?<P>As for fun things that would make the class more enjoyable to play.  Well a spell that combines the elements of sow and lev, maybe as a bird form would be a huge enhancement.  Pets that don't agro afterward would be nice, but maybe this could be done as an element of the hp's when the charm wears off.  ie. if they are over 50% health (the druid has been taking care of them) then they wander off on their own path.  If they are below 50% of their health (they feel abused by the druid) then they should turn on the druid involved.  This will only work if the charm has a set duration, and the druid is notified that the spell is wearing off.  Alternatively, completely change the charm series, making it not a charm at all.  If this was turned into a player buff that animals who approached the player would become inclined to assist the player.  In effect raises the druids faction with animals to the point that not only do the animals never agro while the buff is up, but they also want to protect the player.  I'm not sure if this could be done with the current game mechanics but it is interesting to consider.  Decrease the recast rate on spirit of the cheetah.  In it's current form the spell is almost useless as gate is faster to get up, and sow is more reliable.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>How bout this for a different sort of idea, make it so you could stack a regen type spell with itself up to (level-45) times. This would upgrade a druids AND shamans healing ability but at the expense of recasting those regen spells several times over. <P>For those who aren't too familiar with the mana costs of these, regen costs 100, chloro costs 200, and regrowth costs 300 mana, all lasting ~15 <BR>minutes. The group versions of these cost 200, 300, and 400 mana, lasting ~7.5 minutes.<P>That means a level 60 druid/shaman could cast 15 group regrowths for 6000 mana for 7.5 minutes. This is unlikely to occur, but two druid/shamans could do this for 3000 mana each, being approximitly their entire mana.<P>When a person looks their screen they would not see 15 individual regen spells though, but 1 regen type spell on them. If they looked at what the spell was though it could say "Regrowth x 15"<P>Figureing out a fair and possible way to rework the stacking issues would be a pain though for this idea =\ but I thought mention it anyway.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>==Tracking==<P>This may seem like a silly issue, but why do Druids, as a class, only have a maximum skill at 50 when a Bard has a maximum skill of 100? As a game play issue, Rangers and Druids come from the same magic base. So why is it that a Bard would be a better tracker than a Druid? Personally I would like to see Druids be at least as good a tracker as a Bard and have the skill increased to 100. I don't think this will infringe in the Rangers' ability to track, especially since their class is getting a complete revamp that is Ranger specific.<P>Thanks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>alright for those who think druids are BALANCED or OVERPOWERFUL....really? I am a 60 druid myself and I am trying to understand what you are talking about but I have no idea what you are thinking of while saying druids are balanced anyways...<P>Talking about uber mob raids,  Venril Sathir, Wuoshi, Severilous, Velketor the Sorcerer etc... What are we druids supposed to in these kind of raids? We can NOT have an impact on the raid. We can't contribute anything directly to the raid. Oh you want me to heal? Ok I will heal with a spell that fizzles most of the time heal your 580 hp's or so against a mob hitting for 500-850's. That wouldn't do any good, would it? Oh want me to nuke? I get resisted on every single nuke on Venril Sathir raids usually , same on wuoshi or severilous or trak. What's the point of giving druids a 1k dd nuke? Cast it on lvl 20 mobs and have fun? Oh want me to snare uber mobs? <BR>You begin to cast Ensnare spell <BR>Velketor the Sorcerer has resisted your ensnare spell.<BR>You have been slain by Velketor the Sorcerer.<P>well this is what happens when you try to snare. I can't even land snare, I would be happy to die if I could land snare.<P>I just want druids to have an active role at UBER MOB RAIDS except porting which is an indirect contribution to the raid. Maybe give us a less resistable nuke spell or a  debuff that's at 60 just like mala or malo. Every class is more useful at a raid than a druid. Warriors, necros,  wizards, hybrids, shamans, clerics, enchanters, mages. Think over them and they all can do SOMETHING for the raid that can make an impact on it. But druids can NOT do anything except PORTING PEOPLE.<P>Just give us one single  debuff or nuke or healing spell which can get us back into this game again. Most of the druids are quitting their druids and not even calling them their mains cuz they feel unwanted and useless. And some are discouraged to group people because people won't group us thinking we are useless. And Verant is encouraging people to group? Well certainly druids are the least encouraged class to group and go on raids cuz we are useless there.<P>1 or 2 unique spellz of healing or nuking or debuff(like mala,,malo,slow) or a spell like COTH since druids are known as travelers and porters , they should be able to port people in zone to themselves, as I said a few unique spells would get druids back from the shelf again.<P>I hope my post will help<P>Zannadar<BR>Hierophant of DoA<BR>Fennin Ro<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree with Zanader a lvl 60 druid on high lvl raid doesnt have much to offer more than tansportation. Don't get me wrong I use sup heal but with the fizzle rate it is almost useless once  the lag starts going off the chart. In the beginning I believe it was stated that druids would have good nukes 2nd to only wizzies, yet the mages kick our buts now and have incredible pets as well. Perhaps we could get some sort of dd that would land during an upper lvl raid? Also, decrease the chances that our wind dd we get at 56 will be resisted also. I noticed that the cast time was increased a while back and this is a useful spell but the prob is most of the time we cant use it due to the fact that just about anything u fight at lvl  56 up is indoors but even still the outdoor mobs resist it also when u do happen to find something to kill (turtle in iceclad, etc).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just going to add my opinions to this huge thread, I don't really think that druids before level 49 need anything new. I've read a bunch of terrific ideas here but IMO the class is balanced except at the high levels.  <P>The problem is the role for the backup healers has changed significantly. For the first 40 levels of the game, druids and shamans are reasonably effective in comparison to clerics.<P>Fifty plus however, two or three druids in a group is not as effective as one cleric. Partly it's because of complete heal. Tanks at the higher levels can have 3500 hps easily, a cleric can fully heal one of them at the cost of 400 mana where the druid might expend 1800 mana or more with fizzles.<P>Shamans are in the same boat except that the speed debuffs and weak pet makes them a little more attractive to a group.<P>Will giving druids/shamans a better heal effect the monopoly clerics have currently? I can't see this happening at all. Clerics have the best ac and hp buffs, Clerics have the best heals and Clerics have the best exp ressurections in the game. <P>As for better heals intruding on the clerics specialty, I'm sorry but Celestial Elixir is nothing but a super powered regeneration spell, this should have gone to the regen classes, not to clerics.<P>Not to mention Clerics have the best items in the game for mana free heals, and much higher ac via armor.<P>What do I want to see? Simply Superior Heal being moved to level 49 and a faster and stronger heal at level 55.<P>Lastly I wish it was possible to tailor class abilities to specialization choice. It would be terrific if druids who specialized in Alteration had extra healing power at the cost of some functionality in say evocation. It would go a long way towards allowing people to customize their characters based on their situation, be it wanting to be more attractive to groups or more ability to solo.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Druid and Balance.<P>Healing should be be more in line with the clerics ie give us SupHeal at level 49 and some other form of healing at the mid 50's(Cel Heal or maybe something Different).<P>Our Skin line of spells.  In a group were there is a shaman and or cleric both of there HP buffs stack but druids skins do not.  It would be good if we got an upgrade to SLN in group form in the Mid 50's that would stack with Cleric and Shaman HP Buffs.  I feel that Protection of the Glades is a very nice finishing spell for Druid but its not very well recived if its not going to stack.<P>Direct Damage and Dot's.  Somehow we got our powers taken away over the years.  It seem like ever other class out DD and DOT's us at this point in time(Class Envy).  But from a balance standpoint I do feel that we are lacking.  I would like to see us get an Upgrade to our Immolate spells line.  It seem kinda of funny when you see a mid 50's level druid casting a level 29 spell that does 300 HP of damage.  Also feels kinda of funny standing next to a mage and having them cast a DOT that is as good as our level 44 Dot with there Pet Rooting and swinging away at the MOB for 50+ HP a round.(Class Envy)<P>So here is my list of items that should be considered when looking at the Druids for balance.<P>1. Better Heals(ie SH49, SH+54)<BR>2. Stacking HP/Skin Buffs.(They should all stack with the Cleric/Shaman HP Buffs)<BR>3. Better DOT's(ie not more lines like the Shaman and Necro's have just upgrades at 49 and 56+)<BR>4. Better DD.<BR>5. Incress the Dodge Cap.<BR>6. Questable Druid Armor.<BR>7.

</FONT><HR>I am currently a Lvl 45 Druid. So, I'll give you my 2 cents worth on Druids overall <P>1: Charms- Druids need a better charm version (Lasting longer?) or a charm that that animal won't arggo on the caster. Druids are suppose to be the protectors of the Land. And the Charm series is a joke (Costs alot of mana for little reward). At lvl 45, I charmed a elephant calf, and that lasted only 40 seconds. That is unexceptable. <P>2: Group healing- I'm not sure if this is needed since Clerics are the main healers in EQ. But, if you want druids to be more "group" friendly, then have some of the post 50 heals/buffs (Ex: Pack Chloro, Superior Heal, Regrowth,etc..) be either more mana effecient or lvl lowered. <P>3: Armor- Another question mark issue IMO. The biggest complaint I see alot is that all Druids look the same. And I agree for the most part. With the added Velious add-on, there has been an influx of new armor and itmes. (This is good). However, the Druids that are low level (30 and lower) are pretty much stuck. With the new class specific armor, nothing had changed as far as looks. Maybe that should be address. Also, Plate? I'm not asking high AC like Warriors and such.
