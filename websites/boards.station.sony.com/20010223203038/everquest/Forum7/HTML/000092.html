</FONT><HR>Hi Dancwith! <P>My most memorable death happened with MaddogFreddy too! This guy was born under a bad sign (just kidding).<BR>I'll just copy something I posted here a long time ago (beginning of October 2000). I was 7 at that time, so was MaddogFreddy, it was the first time we met... And remember, this was written some month ago.<P>Turielaen is a level 7 High-Elf wizard lady. Last time I played, I met MaddogFreddy, level 7 bard, who convinced me to pay a visit to Crushbone. I had never been there before, and wondered if our party would be strong enough, be decided to go in the end.<BR>It actually started like a nightmare: I didn't know where I was, there were LOTS of high level Orcs, and I met for the first time an Orc Legionnaire, the bane of the low level Elves!<BR>I fled before him, fell into the small river that runs there, started to swim frantically just to discover he didn't follow me! So I went on the ground again, hid somewhere and started to med to get some mana back. MaddogFreddy was doing OK during that time.<BR>I had nearly recovered when I got attacked by an Orc pawn while medding. I stroke back, he fled, but got some help (Orc slaver this time!!). <BR>Again, I ran out of mana, and decided to hide in the river, then to gate home. So there I was, recovering slowly again, when I suddenly saw the 2 Orcs swimming in my direction! And this time, they beat me to death.<BR>I must say MaddogFreddy was fantastic there. He helped me on my way back to my body, and out of Crushbone. I got killed again just outside the entrance, while he was slain inside CB.<BR>We met again at Orc lift, and although I was no longer in the mood of going there, I felt I couldn't let him go alone there to get his corpse and stuff, after all he had done for me.<BR>We finally got out, said goodbye, and I left the game.<BR>Well, I was feeling a bit frustrated because I was not far from level 8 at the beginning of the game session, and you know what this means for a Wizard (spells!!!). I didn't get any experience during the 2 hours I played. However, this was a very exciting session: thrill, discovery of new areas, friendship. I really enjoyed it, and thank MaddogFreddy for it.<P><BR>End of the story. I am now 18, MaddogFreddy is around 35, this story is one of the reasons why I joined Founders of Honor last Friday  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif">.

</FONT><HR>Hey<P>Maddog is a druid not a bard hehe, and if he finds out you said he was a bard....<P>Anyway, heres my story, the result of which, earned me my surname.  <P>I awake early, eager to be on my way and out of this dark, spooky forest.  It is not yet light and the undead are still roaming the woods in search of wandering prey.  I remember the events,  they  are burned in through fear and through instinct.  I have my new short sword in my right hand.  Morin has bestowed it upon me for returning a map he has long sought after.  I am ready to take on the world.  The sun rises and I say my farewells to Morin, thanking him heartily for my new weapon.  Running East, forever East, I eventuallly reach East Commons.  There, I am confronted by Krusader who wants a duel to the death, but I decline the challenge as I need to get to Firiona Vie,  we have a guild meeting and I need to be there as quick as possible.   <P>Whitewing, a druid in his 35th season, has agreed to teleport me to the butcherblock mountains, where I will hop on a ferry to Kunark.  Things are shaping up well, I have been through an extremely dangerous area on my own and lived, new blade in  my hand, I am brimming with confidence as I board the ferry to Firiona Vie.  <P>I am sitting on a shuttle when I realise we have arrived at the big boat, I spin round and try to get aboard as the shuttle is moving again but alas, I miss my spot and plunge into the water.  Panic quickly sets in as I realise that I cannot get aboard again, I helplessly splash around trying to raise myself onto the platform, to no avail.  Then the boat is gone, so not knowing what else to do, I give chase.  Heart beating, shark fearing, queynos bound, splashing sound.  I am lost at sea, what the hell do I do next?<P>Tunare guides me on, and eventually I see what looks like land up ahead.  My helath is good, but stamina not.  I am not a very good swimmer, but my skill certainly improved on that long cold journey to……<P>An island.  My first thoughts are “what monsters lurk on this seemingly desert island?”  Exhausted but happy for not drowning or being eaten by sharks, I collapse on the beach and rest a while.  I cast camoflage on myself and decide to explore, maybe there is a way off of this place, a dock where the ferry stops perhaps.  My ranger instincts kick in, tracking shows nothing, and im not sure yet if this is good , or bad.  I still have the spirit of Wolf strong in me, so the exploring is easy.  I find a beautiful beach aftter running up and over some rocks, still nothing on track.  I cant see any docks, and a mind meld with the guild tells me that there is a dock on an island but no-one is sure which island im on.  Before I know it, I have travelled the circumference of the island and found nothing, not even a beetle, especially, not a dock. <P>Now I am feeling low.  New sword in one hand, and no blood to spill with it, this cant be right.  Then I mind meld with Whitewing, he tells me that he is on his way to help again.  Not sure exactly what he plans to do but I put my trust in him and wait….<P>It doesn’t take a druid long to reach his destination, wherever it is that he is bound for.  Soon he finds me on the beach, deep in meditation.  I have been practicing my magic and it has vastly improved in this time alone on the island. Whitewing informs me that we are about to attempt a gate, “stay close” he says.  <P>***.  I have entered the dreadlands.  “Lets get outta here” beckons White, he begins to cast some spells, and as we are about to enter a zone entrance, a huge spider emerges, attacks Whitewing and turns on me.  Whitewing is off in a flash, yelling that I should do the same.   I listen, bolting off to where we came from.  Soon tho’ I run out of space and am cornered by the Spider, quickly poisoned, I don’t stand a chance.   She finishes me quickly, mercilessly.  <P>I awake in Queynos, naked and confused.  Whitewings voice in my head tells me that he is about to have me ressurected.  Then all of a sudden, I am in a strange city, Whitewing standing before me, my corpse upon the floor, like a dream.  “Quick, get your stuff and lets be gone from this foul place.”  Not one to argue, I start looting my own corpse.  I only have my weapon in hand when Something beats me back, hard.  It’s a drolvarg rager and he looks very angry.  Lucky for me there are some great warriors in the area, and they take the drolvarg down quickly.  I get my things and sprint off with Whitewing.  Not long outta the city he gets rooted by a widow and promptly killed, I carry on running, blindly, panic now solid in my system, where to go to, spiders and drolvargs everywhere, no wonder its called the dreadlands.  I am only a ranger in my 21st season, and feel desperatley out of place here.  Mountain Giants on my left, 2 of them standing aloft a platform of some sort, I have to go around I decide.  Into the snow, this feels wrong, my ranger instincts tell me, so I turn back, head around the giants once more and hug the treeline on the hill, hoping not to see any more spiders or drolvargs.  But there are many of them, every which way you turn.  I am freaking out so much now that even the tree branches are turning into spiders, this is getting to be a desperate situation.  <P>Then its Whitewing again, he tells me the location of a tunnel to safety, it is not far and the path is dangerous, but light begins to shine in my ranger heart once more.  I creep stealthily through the woods, keeping a watchfull eye on any thing that might move out at me.   I spot a pair of pillars up on the hill, it seems that the location is about right, but wait. There is a drolvarg rager running up toward the pillars, better stay back.  Then it hits me, that must be the tunnel, there is probably a group of hunters up there killing the varg.  I double back and go over the top of the tunnel.   Looking down I see two  Rangers, pummeling the Drolvarg down.  I wait a minute, until the varg is trying to run away.  In a flash I am in the tunnel, trying to realax my breathing, contemplating my narrow escape.  Whitewing turns up minutes later with Doroteya and Menione ready to escort me from this dreaded place.  “youre late for the meeting” they joke.<P><BR>Excerpts from the Woods, by Exarkunn Oceanwalker<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
