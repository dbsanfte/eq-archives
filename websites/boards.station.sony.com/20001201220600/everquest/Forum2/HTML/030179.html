&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Part One: Bullies on the Playground (Long)<P>This is the first in a series of posts, prompted, but not entirely limited to, a phenomenon that has appeared on the Rodcet Nife server, (and other servers, if the posts on the boards are any indication).  EQ is by no means the only place we can observe the behavior, but by its very nature it is a perfect breeding ground for it.  To this writer it is only the most recent example of fundamental flaws in EQ and how Verant chooses to address or ignore them.<P>Who am I?  Three weeks ago I played a 52 ranger on Rodcet named Skyrain Dreamweaver.  Now I don't.  The fun is gone.  There had been a number of issues that had blunted the fun over the past months, but it is the following that finally made me realize the stress level was higher than the fun level, and for the present anyway it looks like that will remain.  Here's what has happened:<P>EQ is at its core a very simple game with very simple scoring.  Players are judged by their levels and the loot they've acquired.  There is nothing else.  There are no real-world rewards offered in the design of course (Ebay is a whole other discussion), just these measurements of status in the game world much as salaries and Porsches are used to measure status in real life.  Verant tell us there are others ways to play the game, and other reasons.  This point of view is seemingly blind to the reality of how the game is played by the majority of the player base.  We'll explore why this has happened in Part Four: Verant's Adventure in Wonderland.<P>Verant is faced with a virtual baby boom of high level players.   This has caught them off guard.  They expected it to take much longer for people to reach high levels.  They thought there would be enough new players coming in to smooth the demographics.  This hasn't happened.  There are now hundreds of 46+ players on Rodcet, and more achieving that level every day.  Their response has been three-fold.  <P>1) They added an extra ten levels.  <P>2) The have added higher-level content from individual quests to new zones to the Kunark expansion pack (and Vellious is now right around the corner).  <P>3) Lastly, they have done everything they can apparently think of to make achievement in the game harder and harder.  Gordon Wrinn has more than once expressed the Verant philosophy: <P>"I do think that players should and can trust that we'll do what we can in order to ensure that EverQuest remains a game that people want to play. Afterall, it's been shown that people do no like to play games that are too easy and where there is no challenge in playing. It's been shown that there is no feeling of accomplishment that comes, for instance, in obtaining an item that "everyone" else has, or has relatively unrestricted access to."<P>The fact is that the challenge seems to be simply increasing the amount of experience points needed to level, or forcing players to wait for hours on end to get a chance at a rare drop.  Remember: levels and loot, that's all there is.<P>There had been earlier instances of the phenomenon I call "bullies on the playground," but it was possible for other players to find different corners of the playground to play in.  With the demographic bulge of players at the top of the xp ladder, this has now changed.  <P>On Rodcet we have a couple dozen guilds at least who are capable of doing planes raids, and taking down some of the most powerful mobs on their own.  It was crowded, but apart from the isolated incident, most guilds were getting their chances at the uber-mobs and the planes because those that got there first had moved on.<P>The most recent attempt to add higher level content has been the addition of the epic quests.  Because completion of many (most? all?) of them required loot from uber-mobs and the planes, players who had their complete sets of planes armor and uber-weapons needed to return there for the quests.  Now the over-crowding has reached the stage that famous psych experiment in over-population reached decades ago.  The mice are beginning to eat each other.  It used to be individuals screaming over a stolen kill, or the pre-emption of someone's camp.  Now entire groups of people are up in arms.  Take a look at the message boards.  Listen in game.<P>What has happened is this: the bullies have taken over playground.  In my next post I'll describe how this is manifesting itself.  <P>Part Two: Am I My Brother's Keeper? (Long)<P>The guild system in EQ was never implemented quite the way the designers have intended.  More than one has listed publicly some of the additional things they wanted to do.  But in fact guilds have prospered.  In the beginning it was individual hunters who grouped together, found some whom they liked grouping with more than others, and eventually formalized these relationships in guilds.  This was by design.  It helped foster community, a necessity for the survival of any persistent world.  <P>For a long time there were very few guilds.  You could do a /who all on a zone, find 35 people (overcrowding as defined in those days!), only one or two had guild tags.  GMs met in game with guild leaders to finalize each one.  Now the situation is reversed.  Most players, even low levels who didn't need to be in a guild in the past, now carry guild tags.  In fact it's somewhat of a stigma for high-level players not to have one.  They are suspect.  Maybe they kill steal… maybe they can't play their characters well enough for anyone to want them…<P>As the mobs became harder and harder, guilds increased in importance.  Consolidations and takeovers occurred, much like corporations, to increase guild strength to the point where the highest mobs could finally be conquered.  The uber-guilds were born.  These were made up for the most part of those players who recognized the only signs of status in the game were levels and loot, and a few others who wanted the greater strategic and tactical challenges taking down a high-level mob offered.<P>And as long as there was enough loot to go around there were few problems.  But the players leveled and multiplied, and soon it was relatively easy for the uber-guilds to take down a dragon or a god.  And they were doing it so much those people newly arrived at the higher levels weren't getting their shot.  Verant responded by the level cap on those who could fight dragons.  Did it work?  That's another discussion.  But there was a recognition at least that something was "unfair" and needed to be addressed by Verant.  Important point to keep in mind: a precedent was set.<P>The number of higher-level players continued to increase.  Squabbling over the planes and uber-mobs increased as well.  Verant looked at their options for satisfying players, and rightly surmised that more content was needed.  But here is where they made their newest mistake.  They made it necessary for everybody, even those who had killed the biggest mobs enough times to feed the biggest great white hunter's ego, to kill them even more times.  To make the quests "harder" they made the drops less frequent.  So the mobs had to be killed even more often.  I have heard it said that Verant may actually limit the number of epic weapons that can be obtained on any server.  True or not, result?  People feel an even greater need to kill those few poor mobs, and kill them now.<P>And in the rush to compete with all the other higher level guilds, toes are getting stepped on.  More and more.  Impassioned and bitter arguments have sprung up when two groups have collided in their attempt to hunt the same mob or plane at the same time.  <P>Some guilds are trying to work through diplomacy to settle disagreements.  Two casual "notification" systems have been attempted: posts in the EQ Vault Rodcet Nife Forum (a forum that otherwise resembles the magic marker scrawls on restroom stalls) and a calendar.  <P>Both are of limited success because the bullies, emboldened by Verant's hands off policy ("You can't reserve the planes."), simply ignore them.   They have stated that they are going to kill anything they want, when they want, because they can.  Alliances have been formed.  Uber alliances of uber guilds routinely race to kill uber mobs before anyone else has a chance.<P>The two systems collide.  More alliances are formed in opposition.  (Check the box your game came in.  Was any of this listed on the cover?  "Have large groups of roving strangers trample on your good time!"  "Try and create a new reservation system that others will respect!")<P>More hard feelings grow.  The diplomacy at times mirrors the playground as well.  The bullies push people around, demanding they be asked first before others can attempt the greatest prizes.  You want to play on the swings?  You wait until we're done.  If enough kids band together maybe they can beat the bullies to the swings, and their larger numbers as a group may help protect them!<P>The bullies have a response to the complaints about them monopolizing the few high-level hunts: "Why can't we share?"  Next we'll examine the playground concept of sharing. <P>Part Three: A Child's Guide to Sharing (Long)<P>There are two common answers from the playground bullies on Rodcet when these issues are raised.  First we have impassioned defenses for their right to have fun.  They are big and strong.  Why should they wait around for lesser guilds to get their acts together?  Why should they stand and wait, not having fun, while others have fun?  Interesting philosophy.  I'd be curious to see how it would play out at Disney World.  Oh wait, it couldn't.   Disney governs who goes on which rides when.  Even has rules of conduct for the millions who visit every year.  Nevermind, doesn't apply to EQ I guess.<P>The other common answer from the bullies is that since there are so many planes-capable guilds, and so few planes, the only solution is "sharing."  Interesting use of the word.  It is of course an attempt to claim some reasonably high moral ground.  "But we want to share!  What do you have against sharing?"  But what is it really?  It is another bully tactic.  And here is how it works…<P>Ashley has been playing with her favorite doll.  Her friend Brittany wants to play with it, but Ashley got there first.  Brittany is older than Ashley, so she takes the doll, promising to share after she's had her turn.  The fact is that what Brittany has done is not sharing, but coercion.  Ashley has two choices: to wait her "turn," or to plead her case to a higher authority, someone "bigger" than Ashley: an adult.  But the damage has been done.  Because Brittany could take the doll, she did.  <P>We see this behavior in children all the time.  What do we call them?  Ah yes: Brats.<P>On a plane sharing means two things: incredible lag, and the larger guild gets the most pulls.  They can recover faster, get more statics, more loot, etc.<P>Is there a higher authority in Everquest?  No, not really.  To their credit Verant polices certain social aspects of the game: harassment, racism, and a few others.  Of course, if they didn't, they'd risk legal action.  But what about something like disputes over the facilities, the activities, the fun stuff in the game?  The policy is explicitly to NOT get involved.  But wait, didn't we mention they nerfed the level limits on dragons?  Wasn't that a precedent?<P>Sharing has been institutionalized for adults, because believe it or not there are adults how never learned all their social lessons properly.  At a tennis club for example you do indeed reserve courts for a set period of time.  And if someone steps on someone else's reservation, they risk penalties imposed on them.  If they refuse to accept the penalties, they can get kicked out of the club.  Even public courts post rules, but there is an important distinction.  Public courts are for the most part free.  Tennis clubs charge dues.  You pay for your fun.  And part of the responsibility of the club is to do everything it can to guarantee the fun for all members.  <P>Everquest is not free.  We pay for our fun.  You'd think we'd have a right to expect those who govern Everquest to take the responsibility to do everything they can to ensure we have it.  What has gone wrong?<P>Part Four: Verant's Adventures in Wonderland (Long)<P>The fact is there is a great difference between the game originally envisioned by the designers, the game I think they truly believe they -have- designed, and the game their player base is actually playing.<P>They have trouble coming up with solutions because they don't -seem- to see the problems.  It's no wonder communication between players and Verant can at times resemble the Mad Hatter's tea party.  <P>1. In answer to players' complaints about long camps, we're told that's only one way to play the game.  Players will be disappointed if that's all they do.  <P>But it's the -only- way to get the best items in the game.  Even the epic quests are simply longer strings of FedEx shipments and camps.  And as was pointed out in my first post there are only two ways to measure success in the game: levels and loot.  High-level players are judged as much by what they are wearing than any skill they might have at playing their characters. "Is that a complete suit of thorny vine?!  You rock, bro!"  <P>GM "events" like Halloween where nothing really happens except every low level in the zone gets slaughtered until an uber guild moves in and reaps the drops.  I was intrigued by Absor's admission that he likes being a victim.  Bill Troost's defense of the player as victim as part of the "story-telling was equally illuminating.  There's a word for people who like to be victims.  It's called masochism.  <P>You REALLY think people are paying you their money to be VICTIMS?  Not heroes?  But VICTIMS?  Ignoring Joe Campbell, Tolkien, every action/adventure film ever made, all tabletop RPGs and MUDs, Psychology 101, and god knows what else, simply to try and defend an event structure that had not improved one iota on the Halloween "event" from a year before?  I guess you can't really learn from mistakes, if you don't see you've made any.<P>3. The recent comments in response to casual players is a perfect example of how they fail to recognize the importance of the other game scoring device: leveling.<P>I've talked with a great many game designers.  To a one all understand that "waiting" as a game dynamic is a terrible thing to design into your game.  Yet it is at the core of the "challenge" in Everquest.  Enforced boredom (You want that Testament of Veneer?  You wait.) brought on by static camps from the lowest "quest" item to the highest uber-mob is a fundamental aspect of the design of the game.<P>How can casual gamers possibly hope to compete for these drops.  And who is Verant to suggest that they're playing the game wrong if they even expect to?<P>Yes, EQ HAS turned its back on casual gamers.  Of course it has.  And of course they're penalized by the narrowness of what it means to "advance."  The designers have been mesmerized by the hard core gamers, and their demands for more and more.  The baby boomers want their toys.  And EQ has no more ways to respond than make more items available, make more camps and longer ones.<P>What the epic quests would do to competition among the higher levels for the few resources should have been obvious.  Gordon Wrinn should not have been allowed to announce publicly how all the quests were working, and the long time it took to design each one.  How do these things happen?  Here's one possibility:  <P>How many "designers" does Verant have working on Everquest?  At times they seem to outnumber Q&A.  <P>I'm reminded of a cartoon an artist friend had posted above his desk.  It showed a classically stereotypical artist complete with pointy beard, beret, smock, palette and brush, poised before a blank canvas on a tripod.  He is standing at the end of a long table lined with men in suits.  The caption was: Art by Committee.  Now, whether EQ is art or not is not the issue.  But the fact is that committees rarely manage to make ANYTHING great or enduring.  The Porsche was not designed by a committee.  "Hamlet" was not written by a committee.  Neither was "MULE" for that matter.<P>One person can have a vision certainly.  Two?  Of course: Sid Meir and Bruce Shelley.  But every time you add another pair of eyes the vision starts to blur.  Without a guiding hand to hold all of the threads, and tie up all of the loose ends, visions unravel.  And what started out to be a sweater looks more like an ever-growing expanse of patchwork.<P>The epic quests?  Each one done by a different individual who apparently had lost the telephone extension and email of all the others.<P>One final chapter will plant a signpost at the beginning of a route out of Wonderland. <P>Part Five: Are we having fun yet? (Long)<P>Is addiction fun?  Only part of the time.<P>What could Verant do about the fundamental problems of EQ, if they could wake up one morning to a satori, and discover there ARE problems?<P>Well, they could take the road they have in the past.  Deny there's a problem, then scurry to address it in the next expansion (Trying in Kunark to reduce those static spawns that are "only one way" to play the game for example.)  Then address it by adding more of the same.  Higher mobs, higher weapons, the need for 50 people to kill one thing instead of forty, increasing rarity of drops.  It is a game after all of levels and loot, remember?  If there were anything else to EQ, their solutions would address it, wouldn't they?<P>I repeat: there is a great difference between the game originally envisioned by the designers, the game I think they truly believe they -have- designed, and the game their player base is playing.<P>Until some recognition of that occurs, don't expect anything approaching a legitimate solution.<P>Wonder why they demographics are so skewed to the high end?  The mantra we hear chanted in the halls of Verant most often in the face of criticism is that now there are over 300,000 registered players of EQ.  More than AC or UO, yes.  But it's such a drop in the bucket of internet users, even internet gamers, I'd be embarrassed.  And remember how long ago they announced that first 200,000?  And how long it took to get half of that this time?  Do a graph.  Would you buy that stock?<P>The fact is that even the hardcore are getting restless, and there are promising competitors emerging on the horizon.  <P>So what are we left with in the meanwhile?  More and more loot?  More and more waiting?  And at the end a higher end game where the players are forced to govern themselves like some teeming crucible of democracy disguised as entertainment.<P>What about that signpost to a solution?  There are two parts:<P>First, stop being defensive.  As hard as that might be.  Stop it.  Stop blaming your player base.  Gordon Wrinn:<BR>"It's a bit depressing. On one hand we have a ton of players asking for more GM interaction within the game, more quests, better stories, etc., and on the other we have the hecklers who scream any time we make an attempt to drag them away from their 4 hour stop-watch campfest that they complain constantly about… <BR>…There are many dynamic quests, and contrary to popular belief they usually entail something beyond GMs just running out and killing everyone. If people would take a second before nuking the central character, maybe they'll find out what it is all about."<P>There was also a sad quote from one of the "designers" at the recent launch party.  I wish I could find it now, but basically he was insisting there was a full, rich storyline in Everquest, and that people were simply failing to uncover it.  This is such a page from the amateur writer's scrapbook, it needs to be mentioned.  Successful writing is 1) inspiration and talent and 2) the ability to present the work to the audience so that it can experience it.  If you fail at number two, one is meaningless.  Stop blaming your audience if they don't get it!<P>People are simply playing the game you designed.  If it isn't the one you wanted to design, or thought you designed, then change it.<P>If you truly feel that the calendars and scheduling conflicts are immersing players even more in the world of Norrath; if you truly feel the bullies have a right to their fun more than others simply because they are bigger and stronger; if you truly feel the uber-guilds should have fun at Halloween events while lower level characters get to play victims; if this truly -is- the vision, then sit back, and let the good times roll.<P>But if you suspect there may be serious problems, and you can get beyond blaming your customers, start accepting responsibility.  Re-examine the design openly.  Trust your players a bit more.  If you play black box management of your player base ("Epic quests are all working."  "No problems with rangers."), when you finally do try to improve something, you shouldn't be surprised you get more backlash than thanks.<P>And govern the world you have created.  Everquest is not a free public playground.  People pay money to play here.  It is not their responsibility to ensure that all players in the playground have fun.  It is yours.<P>Believe it or not there is much that I find fine and entertaining and beautiful about Everquest.  I would have not spent the past three weeks researching and writing this, if I didn't mourn what EQ could have been.  Might be.  But it is a flawed gem, and it is fracturing along the fault lines.<P>Is Everquest fun?<P>Not anymore.  Not for Skyrain.  Not at level 52.  So he asked me to write this to try and express his frustration and sadness.  I hope I have in some small way done him justice.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Intersting and literate post, thank you.  But I think you make an assumption that doesn't apply to all players.  You assume all players are rushing to aquire the highest levels and loot.  That isn't nescessarily so, a lot of us  ( ok I am generalizing here, but at least me and some of my friends ) play just for the fun of it.  And no, we aren't the ones running around the EC tunnel begging, we do pretty well.  <P>=)<P>- Torf  ( Erollisi Marr )</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Fantastic, a well thought out, literate post that I think describes the feelings a lot of us have.<P>I am addicted to EQ and play it almost to the exclusion of everything else, and that is with the flaws you point out (which I think are pretty apparent).<P>The reason and one which I think Verant will realise in the near future is simply because EQ is the best of a bad crop, it is by far and away the best MMORPG available at the moment. However with a slew of new games on the Horizon I do wonder if Verant see the flaws in their vision and if so do they have the courage to address them before they lose their customer base to 'the next big thing'?<P>EQ2 I hear you cry... I think many people will steer clear of this in favour of an untried company purely because of Verant`s  poor CS record (yes I`m a European subscriber).<P>Vanis<BR>23rd Bard of The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Take it home tonight, prop their feet up on the coffee table, crack the top on a cold one, and really read Skyrain's post. Then, take a little time and think about it. Don't take 30 seconds and give a four sentence answer that is supposed to encompass the entire thing. Go back and reread a few paragraphs. Think some more. Reread some more. Think some more. Rinse and repeat until 2 AM or alcohol supply is extinguished.<P>If our buddies at VI would take the time to really think about these kinds of issues as an individual instead of a 'spokesperson' or 'representative', I think some amazing revalations would come be. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One word comes to mind: WOW.  What a posting.  Methinks I'm going to make a copy of that post to keep when it gets trimmed for the monthly (bi-weekly?) thread removal.<P>My take on things?  Well...<P>I've admittedly never gotten above level 20, I enjoy the newbie scene and don't twink or get twinked.  I don't want the hardcore campfest that seems to accompany higher levels, and I enjoy being able to level easily without helle levels.  I also like the fact that I could probably play with another set of low level people each day for months and never see the same person twice.  Lots of people around that range.<P>I will say one thing for content: It's true, there is some semblance of a story.  However, what we have are threads here and there.  High elves hate dark elves, and dark elves hate high elves.  Dwarves hate ogres.  The Mudtoes, clan crushbone, the kerran and erudite struggle.  The Hole, paineel.  The Freeport militia.<P>We've got plenty of threads, but there's no quilt to show the whole story and how it relates.  How did I get the majority of the EQ storyline?  Mostly from the 1st edition stategy guide, admittedly.  Some from the game, but not much.<P>Hailing people for information is what is portrayed as being the most important information gathering mechanism in the game.  However, most of the NPC's don't respond to hails.  Just a blank stare.<P>Compare this to newer city content -- Paineel and Cabilis.  Nearly EVERYONE has something to say in Paineel.  There's a real, living, breathing history of Paineel if you hail everyone.  One vendor has begun to question the power of Cazic and makes idols to Tunare.  This librarian is old and forgetful.  This necromancer wants the package from the librarian.  These ghosts 'were once alive,' as one says.<P>Cabilis is quite similar.  Neary everyone has something to say, and things are emoted as well as spoken.  There is an air of greed, with the Haggle Baron loving matters dealing with 'heavy coin.'  There are book vendors that sell books (at the most, 3s methinks) telling the history of Sebilis and Cabilis -- New Sebilis.  There's a history of the City of Mist, from what I understand.  Drops of notes that explain what happened to make it a ghost town.  The greed, the turning away from Cazic that led the City to its demise.<P>With the old world, the most surprising thing I saw was randomly saying "Where is the warrior's guild?" to a clockwork in Ak'anon, and having the clockwork actually take me there.<P>If anything, I want the new story content designers to redo the old world stories and NPC's.  I want every NPC to emote something, I want every NPC to have something to say.  I want merchants to say something as they do in paineel.  I want one merchant to be a little out there (cloth vendor in paineel is looking forward to his sale pamphlets, a little too enthusiastically).  <P>I want books.  There needs to be a librarian in every city that sells AT LEAST 16 books about the history.  And the books need to be cheap, so the newbie that's just killed his first bat and only has 16 copper from the bat wings, can buy all of the books and can learn from the history.  Just as there are books in Cabilis available from different guilds.  And maybe attach those vendors to that guild faction, so if you want to know about the paladin guild as a shadowknight, you cannot.  You'd need to find a paladin that's corrupt enough to tell you.<P>If anyone important out there is reading, give those content creators who worked on Paineel and Cabilis/CoM a pat on the back.  That's the content that I'm looking for.  And let them recreate the history for the old world too.  I want books written by Tier`Dal explaining why they hate everyone, and why they're using the trolls and orcs.  I want books written by Halflings explaining what joys Bristlebane gave to them.  And a book of clever Limericks -- how utterly halfling!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Maybe an NPC that'll give you a scroll with a random joke or limerick on it for a gold.  Little things like that is what makes the game truly immersive!<P>The content is there, in threads.  But to weave a story, you need a spinning wheel.  That's what's missing.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absolutely one of the best posts I've read in a long, long time Skyrain. It is exactly for these reasons that I, (level 50 druid), have canceled my account and uninstalled the game. I would love to see Verant answer this in an intellegent and thoughtful manner. However, all your likely to recieve is about 4 sentences of some completely degrading and arrogant rebuttal from one of those "holier than thou" Verant employees. Proving your point.  Be afraid EQ. Be very afraid. You player base is going to abandon you in droves once a decent alternative arives on the scene.

</FONT><HR>Very well written.  It's refreshing to see a well-thought-out, clearly-written post on the subject.<P>Verant's 'Vision' seems to be cross-eyed.  On the one hand they tell us that the cure for most ills in the game is to stop camping and just explore and adventure.  On the other hand, they tell us they are making the really good lewt harder to get to increase it's desirability and the sense of accomplishment that goes along with obtaining such prizes.<P>If we're to go explore and adventure (and not camp) that sense of accomplishment and the powerful goodies that go with it are not available.  If we camp the 'phat lewt' in order to achieve that feeling of accomplishment, we're not playing the game as 'intended' and have only ourselves to blame for the problems inherent in that set-up (so we're told).<P>I really get the feeling that Verant had a somewhat hazy idea of where they intended to go with Everquest in the original development phase.  After all, there hadn't been a great deal of other work in this field previously (certainly nothing with the player base we have now.)  The problem now is that we're stuck with the design flaws - Verant is leery of fundamentally changing a game design that is currently making them a lot of money (they've even stated as much in posts responding to suggested game changes) for fear of derailing the gravy train.  <P>They really don't seem to want to commit themselves to serious, fundamental changes to fix these problems, either.  They are cautiously making positive changes (the random-mob loot instead of static-mob loot seen in a limited fashion in Kunark), but the changes generally are too small to make a real change in the way the game plays.<P>Verant does seem to favor the powerful, high-end gamers over the lower-level casual gamers as well.  The 'newbie/lowbie-as-victim' special events are a prime example of this attitude.  The implementation of the uber-weapon quests is another - many zones that were good, solid places for the low and mid level players to adventure in now have extremely high level aggressive monsters and npc's running loose in them.  Said new creatures are basically random, inescapable death for the players of the appropriate level for the zone.  Now, being threatened with death in a situation where you have some chance of escaping through use of one's wits and abilities adds excitement and thrill to the game.  Being presented with death that you have no hope of escaping no matter what you may try just adds frustration, and if the only way of avoiding that death is to avoid the zone entirely, you've just ruined a significant portion of the game's content for that section of the game populace.  The 'rampaging dragon in the lowbie zone' special events are more of the same.  Sad and wrong, when the 15th level lowbie is paying the same amount per month for the game as the 60th level Godslayer, but is treated with so much less respect.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Skyrain,<P>A wonderful wonderful read.  I have so many ideas and thoughts about what you said, there simply isn't room.<P>I wish we as players could be trusted to govern ourselves as Verant would have us do - but we've proven time and time again, worse on some servers than others, that we cannot be trusted and that the bully element will always rise to the top to take what they want.  On Rodcet Nife, the feeling I get is that we are luckier than most servers as far as this goes, but I feel the crunch coming more and more with the epic quest issues.<P>Verant did make the most wonderful game I've ever played, but every player knows that there were so many things they could have (and still can) do to make it even better.<P>Thanks for taking the time to write this Skyrain, I, at the least, appreciate it.<P>Yeawen Peregrinator<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>great post. dead on, i'm gonna save it and repost it once a week till i finally get banned  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>i do have this to add tho:<P>the problems you mention though, eventually boil down to the fact that alot of people who play EQ are inconsiderate jerks.<P>Verant is actually partially to blame for this. I believe the high level game in EQ actually stands a good chance of turning any given person into an inconsiderate jerk.<P>Why? Skyrain hit it dead on: there is nothing in EQ but loot and levels, and both require such immense patience and time to actually achieve that a gamer actually LOSES consideration for other gamers out of frustration. <P>"It's bad enough that i have to sit at this spawn for 15 hours to have a chance at x item.  I'm sure as hell not gonna wait for him to do it first or i'll be an old man before i get it done."<P>get the idea?  Then the game makes it even worse by essentially rewarding this type of mentality: the above player will actually benefit in EQ for shafting other people.<P>Verant insists that these players will get a bad rep and be punished by their peers by being excluded on high-lvl raids.  ideally, yeah they will. in reality, however, they don't. this is because, like a said, the high level game actually TURNS people into jerks, and these newly created EQ jerks then band together and there you have it, the origin of many of the so called "uber-guilds." DISCLAIMER: i realize that the preceding is not true of all uberguilds  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>awhile back someone posted a link to the afterlife admission requirements/process webpage under the auspices that it was the funniest thing he had ever seen.  i didn't know what afterlife even was at the time, so i went and looked expecting to see a comic or goofy EQ art. i'll be honest; when i first read the page i thought it was a big sarcastic joke to make fun of uberguilds.  The page was so stereotypical of the uberguild "we're VIP because we're good at this dumb game" attitude that i figured it HAD to be a joke.  lvl requirement for a paladin to be considered is 61, lol, good one.  Then i read more and surfed the rest of the page and discovered that these guys were really a guild and deadly serious.<P>the point of that little tirade? simple. at the very least, the people who run that guild have to be jerks.  how could you exclude an entire class from membership if you weren't?  i understand the need for lvl requirements in guilds to ensure that the members of the guild can actually play with each other, but the equip and varying entrance lvls for each class and the complicated and tedious procedure for getting an invite even if you meet the requirements are obscene. even I, who play this game WAAAAYYYYYY too much found myself contemplating what losers these people must be in RL (and was suitably ashamed of myself for doing it...i really do try to avoid stereotyping like that, especially in cases where i probably fit the stereotype  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">).<P>And EQ rewards them HEAVILY for being jerks... just check out the things they've been able to do.  at the time i think they had just dropped gorenaire for the first time ever, had at least 2 or 3 members as winners of the BoTB on that server and at least one as the winner of the entire competition, had just done VP again, had just done a 7th island PoS raid, yada yada, yada...hey, i have a photographic memory, leave me alone  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>the point is, as long as you can "get ahead/feel powerful" in a game or anything else by being a jerk, tons of people will do it, which is essentially why most people hate pvp so much.<P>and it's gonna take some REALLY heavy-handed game design decisions to make it so that being a jerk has no benifits...heck, verant's decision to allow players to choose whether to be pk or not was avant-garde when EQ came out, and that's just scratching the surface of potential anti-jerk measures  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>too much bacardi tonight, i'm rambling...<P>Solann</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Riczer1,<P>I know Verant doesn't want to overhaul the code of a complex game like EQ.  That has been their response to a number of issues people have raised, and it's often a valid one.  I'm looking more for a paradigm shift than a code rewrite.  But there is a vast amount of hubris in play here.  Arrogance (300,000 subscribers!) and ignorance (It's the players fault they haven't found the story!).

</FONT><HR>Unfortunately Sky, I wouldn't expect a response to this thread.  It seems that they usually ignore the threads that were the most well-written, with the best public discourse or public agreement.  <P>However, just out of curiosity, what sort of a response are you looking for?  By that I don't mean what response do you -want-, but what exactly do you want answered?  -  Whether or not they would work to ameliorate this situation?

"The game isn't just about loot and levels," or something to that effect.<P>On a side note, I have this to say about your original post (that I was going to post before I saw your last question.)  First of all, excellent work - I'm glad you put in the time and effort to explain yourself so well and so thoroughly, because in doing so you painted a perfect description of the problems so many people see in this game.  Second of all...my main character is a level 50 Ranger on Quellious and I have serious reservations about playing him much past 51 (which I want to reach), more because of the reasons listed in your post than because of the problems with Rangers post-50.  I do not have, will not have, and likely won't want to spend the time necessary to accomplish things between 51 and 60.<P>Zaphirien Tinuviel<BR>Ranger of 50 Summer Seasons<BR>Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Very interesting read.<P>&lt;&lt; There was also a sad quote from one of the "designers" at the recent launch party. I wish I could find it now, but basically he was insisting there was a full, rich storyline in Everquest, and that people were simply failing to uncover it. This is such a page from the amateur writer's scrapbook, it needs to be mentioned. Successful writing is 1) inspiration and talent and 2) the ability to present the work to the audience so that it can experience it. If you fail at number two, one is meaningless. Stop blaming your audience if they don't get it! &gt;&gt;<P>I believe you have succeded at both 1. and 2.

How would you and the other players out there improve them?  <P>Understand you've taking some major shots at us, not all of them free of venom, so we're not entirely pleased with you.

</FONT><HR>Skyrain,<P>Exactly.  Indeed.  All of it is 100% my thoughts about the game, just more eloquently put.<P>When EQ was released, a lot of my friends started playing.  I refused, resisted but finally caved in.  Now I'm the only one who still plays regularly.  I'm a powergamer, I didn't start out that way but as I got higher level, read more message boards, joined a larger more powerful guild, that's just how I turned out.<P>In the last 13 months I have played almost exclusively a shaman.  Talamay is level 56 now.  In the last couple months I've grown disenchanted with camping experience and loot.  I don't play to get myself the loot, not directly.  Not anymore.  I play to help my "uber guild" (Sol Invictus on Tribunal Server) become more powerful.  I'm a new member, but almost all the time I put into the game lately has been doing things for the guild...<P>I see similar situations on Tribunal as you have (had) on Rodcet Nife.  I run a message board for scheduling planes, dragon and uber mob raids.  I see the exact same issues coming up.  Tribunal isn't a new server anymore.  Its old.  Its 14 months old.  I know people that have 2, 3 and sometimes FIVE level 50+ characters.  There's a score of planes capable guilds/alliances, and they're all doing the same exact thing right now.<P>Bickering over who gets the gods and dragons next for the drop of the Epic Quest items.  Verant, you made a terrible mistake.  The epic quests are ruining the game, really.  People I have known for months who'd never speak ill of another are now flaming each other, bickering, throwing tantrums and just plain *****ing.  And its all about the Epic Quests.  Before, it was planes armor.  But that wasn't a huge deal.  There wasn't as many guilds / alliances capable of even breaking a plane, let alone clearing it.  Now we have roughly 24 "entities" that have booked Fear and Hate through the end of December.  <P>A few of the guilds are going BACK to the planes after not going regularly for several weeks or even months.  Not all the members may have armor, but the kunark armor is better.  So it wasn't a priority to do planes.<P>Now with quests requiring a drop that only comes from a mob that only spawns after Cazic Thule himself dies these guilds are racing to get the gods.  Guilds are "offering" to "help" the smaller guilds that have scheduled a planes raid by "assisting" in killing Cazic or Innoruuk.  Then they pawn off the God's loot for the Epic Quest items.  <P>Verant, don't you see a problem with this?  "oh, they'll just 'happen' upon it while adventuring".  Thats a crock and you know it.  Denial is ruining your company, ruining your game.  For the record I will never buy another game that Verant publishes/creates/designs/whatever.  I will probably buy Scars of Velious so I can continue playing with my friends.  But Star Wars, EQ2, whatever... Not a snowball's chance...<P>Personally I'm playing for my friends and guildmates.  I have had it with rare drops off rare spawns that 6 other people want and trying to win a random against them.  I actually won a blood point in a random (no one in group needed for use) and gave it away to a friend in another guild.  I was glowing for the next two days.  I had a tear in my eye when she saw it in the trade window with my name in green.  I couldn't stop smiling.  Regardless of how good that felt it STILL involved a 20+ hour camp (combined trips to Howling Stones, etc).  <P>As much as I enjoy playing for/with the people, my friends, I know that they're only playing for the loot and levels.  I'll stick around until my friends list is empty from people leaving the game.  <P>That was longer than I thought it would be... Guh.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The companies philosophy behind this game needs to be reworked before the somewhat peaceful server that I am on gets to this point (or is getting).  I enjoy the multiuser world and interaction with most of the people that play alongside me in Norrath.  Verant, please look through this post and take it to heart.  Even those people who blast every post concerning these types of aspects of the game can see that this post touches a nerve.  I don't think that there is one person subscribed to this game that isn't going to be affected by the outdated (not flawed) philosophy at some point. <P>Once again, amazing post.<P>Diel De'Koenig<BR>Knights of the Tribunal<BR>Tribunal server.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I hope to see some sort of a response to this thread, from anyone at Verant, who feels that they can make an educated, fair response to it.

Our servers playground bullys have 3 guides, I know for sure one is a senior as he told me so when we have hunted together, in their ranks as well as Jeff Butler being an exmember. Our server GM has been in their out of game IRC chat multiple times as stated by the guild itself.<P>Verant likes mob rule, if they didnt they wouldnt have been catering to uber guilds all this time.<P>Point in case: New guild creation requires you to have the people to start the guild online at the same time so the GM can see them all together.

</FONT><HR>Thanks for the great post, it was 'dead on' and although long, it summed pretty much everything up that is happening on Fennin Ro as well.  We've tried calendars and scheduling of the planes.  We've tried to limit how many raids each guild can have a month, and every guild agreed to it at first and it worked beautifully.  Until, the biggest guild on the server (yep you guessed it, the schoolyard bullies) decided that because Verant didn't support the calendar that they didn't have to abide by it, and time and time again use the calendar to make sure they get the only chances at the uber/rare mobs.  Someone have Vox scheduled for Friday?  Take it out Thursday so they can't.  That sort of thing.  Someone scheduled for Hate today?  Lets go up and demand they share, we have more people so we'll get Inny first anyway.  It's pathetic and getting worse by the day.  I for one am not going to quit the game over it, I'm going to make my stand, and accept being banned for it later on.  I pay my 10$ a month as well, and I expect to have a chance to take out a god like the rest of the high level players on Fennin.  If we aren't allowed that chance, then we'll have to take it by force.  It's that simple.  At least until Verant decides to step in and actually HELP their paying customers solve these issues.<P>Thanks again for the post, I know VI will either ignore it or tear it apart saying your analogies stank, but we, the customer, know it to be truthful.  /bow<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It was indeed a very good post.  While you may not receive a response, I wager that Abashi will at least have read it.  I'm not sure at this time that he could fathom the kind of response he would like to provide, other than "I have read what you've written."  That's not a slam on Abashi, simply recognition of his role in Verant's CS structure.  <P>What's important now are solutions. How do we solve the bullying and other issues you've addressed?  I'm honestly not sure what can be done, but I'm very interested in hearing ideas, especially if they're presented with the same eloquence and moderation as Skyrain's.<P>-TTm</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well TickTock, they can start by taking Uber Quest items off the gods in Hate and Fear.  As several people have said in this thread already, most of the people going after these weapons have nothing left to do in the Planes other than get that item.  That way they won't be wasting their time and those who still need planes armor can go about getting it without having to deal with the top guilds (for the most part).<P>Other than that, I'm not sure what they can do about the 50-60 game that exists.  How can you make the game move faster and get rid of long, long camps?<P>Zaphirien</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/030179-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/030179-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/030179-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/030179-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/030179-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/030179-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=030179&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=030179&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
