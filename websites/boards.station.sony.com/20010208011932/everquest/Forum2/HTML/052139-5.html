Sometimes when my group is really ripping through the mobs, I'll only mez the others with enthrall...but then for some reason, the group starts slowing down, not killing as fast, has an additional mob come on them, then the mob I mezzed will need to be mezzed again, and this time, I'd rather do a longer mez, but I can't overwrite the original one.

</FONT><HR>Enchanters are very well balanced in the old world and RoK all the way to 60 for six person groups/dungeon crawling.  <P>In SoV, enchanters are completely broken.  As has been stated, we are the only class with all our spells (except tash) checked vs magic.  This means that we are useless beyond casting two (sometimes three or four) buffs in 80% of SoV encounters.  You took a class with people that enjoyed being very active in battle and forced them to be passive.<P>In epic SoV encounters, life as enchanter is very dull.  We cast one or two buffs (one if more than one enchanter present, two if we're the only one - one enchanter can cover a raid of 50 people), then sit and watch a 10 minute fight or die.  My typical epic encounter is buff, recant, tash, die.<P>Problems I'd like to see resolved:<P>1)  Reduce the taunt of tash.  Currently tash is often instant death against epic mobs.  I can wait until a mob that takes 10 minutes to kill is at 20% health until I cast tash.  Even with all that built up hate, I'm summoned and killed immediately.  Tash is a spell that is only usefull if cast early.  Please give us the ability to cast it when needed and survive.  Remember that epic mobs can kill an enchanter in two rounds of mele.<P>2)  Recast time on Visions of Grandeur.  I don't see how chain casting a haste buff could be an issue.  Please remove the very long recast time on our level 60 buff.<P>3)  Our level 55 animation.  Enchanters have had to deal with every pet nerf, yet we never get new pet additions.  Please make our level 55 animation duel wield when cast.  <P>Would also be nice to give our 55 animation the /pet attack command.  Considering the high mr of SoV mobs, allowing our 55 animation to attack would give us some sort of utility against high hp/mr mobs.  We still wouldn't have the other commands of real pet classes<P>4)  Give us some sort of non-magic check spells.  I tried casting every spell I have on a dwarf in Thurgadin that's green at level 35.  The only one that stuck was Dictate.<P>5)  The effects on our SoV armor are sad.  Rune IV on the robe is useless.  Other classes get their high level spells on their chest piece, please give us Rune V or Bedlam.  Putting stuns on items is a waste.  What use is the 15 second cast time on my crystaline crown of confusion other than preventing me from casting a spell for 15 seconds?  Buffs on items are only useful if they are the top of the line or seomething we don't have in our spell books.  Low level damage spells are at least useful in that they do something for nothing.  Utility spells (ie invis)can be useful in that we don't have to swap it in to a spell slot.<P>6)  Please don't give us nw illusions and call us fixed.  I could care less about illusions.  Please look in to making us active/useful in SoV/epic enounters<P><BR>Qucay<BR>level 60 Enchanter<BR>Afterlife<BR>Mith Marr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OMG - can't believe you're every going to get through all that to read mine, but I'll do my bit anyway - shouldn't have left work early - lol.<P>LET ME SAVE YOU THE BREATH - <BR>CHANGING THE MEZ RESTRICTIONS IS NOT A CLASS BALANCE ISSUE IN VELIOUS - IT IS A GAME DESIGN ISSUE!<P>That said; the game design need to change or we arn't going, except in very limited situations. If the game design was changed we would be as effective as before AND STILL BE OUT OF BALANCE.<P>I'll try to abreviate:<BR>1. DOT's need to work faster,and while I've never experienced it not working, they should always stack.<BR>2. NEED A BIGGER DD SPELL! The 54 spell is way under powered compared to all other classes. BIG NUKE PLS. Often thought we should have a poof monster spell like the necro/cleric to use on MOB casters too.<BR>3. Debuffs need to work.<BR>4. We want more illusions, maky? (Pats Absor on head, its ok you can do it)  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>5. Self-only mana regen to stack with clarity or c2. Don't know about these other lame enchanters who find themselves with mana to burn, I myself am always lower mana than anyone in most situations. They all must be NO NUKE activists.<BR>6. Two of the mana vial series should be mana potions, clarity and c2. Very expensive, would not be abused.<BR>7. The higher level mez's should be better fix'd duration than Dazzle - if its at all mezable, it can be mez'd with Dazzle.<BR>8. All charm's 49 and above should be fixed duration, progressivly better.<P>PLEASE PLEASE IT'S ABOUT BALANCE NOT MEZ ONLY!<P>The rest is pretty much covered. Thanks for reading my thoughts if you get this far, hope glasses are covered in your medical.

</FONT><HR>First off enchanters die more than most other classes becuase of the high taunts... how is this balanced... shouldn't all classes be attacked equally?  I can except the fact we have a weaknes but the other high taunting class clerics get additional help with that... high ac, more hps, and divine aura.  We need somthing more to help.  I suggest an upgrade to color stun series making the cast 1 sec too all of them, adding a slight increase to the stun time and reducing the resist rate.  Also the amount of creature that can resist mezz is too high.  I don't understand a giant can be feared and rooted, but not mezzed... is there a reason?  Ok your trying to make the game more challenging... fine but don't completely pull a bait and switch us.  Reduce the time the creature is mezzed to keep us on our toes.  One last item on big raids all classes should be able to be useful... the argument is that every class can be useful just there role changes.  Well i don't believe we were warned when we started each of our respective classes it said post 50 your role well change and most your spells well not work.  That needs to be looked into for the good of the game and keeping customers.  I want to be able to contribute fully during a raid just like i did in Mistmoore, Unrest, and Befallen.  As a consumer this appears to be a bait and switch to me.  Other wise enchanters are really fun class i would actually say that some of the buff/debuffs are too powerful at there lvl and should be given at later spell lvls.  Anyways i am done thinks for listening.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Additional Changes: For the mana cost and recast time, Dinn's Dizzying Draught really should be a long set duration stun.  It should also have its resistability EXTREMELY reduced.  In the 20 or so levels since I got it, I've gotten it to stick ONCE.  That's a lot of resists...<P>I definately agree with the posts asking for religion specific items or spells.  I mean, I dunno what the god of Peace (Quellious) did to make everyone so mad, but it's harder for me to get into some cities than it is for classes who CAN'T cast illusions.  I know Ogres and even humans who can bind in Cabilis because they're agnostic, but I've been hunting alongside them the entire time raising my faction and the Iksar still scowl at me even in Iksar illusion.  I wrote up a big long e-mail with religion based "Epic Quest" spells for all the spellcasting classes, perhaps I should post it here... but religion profoundly hurts enchanters, because so many of our quests seem to assume we're agnostic.<P>I agree with what Leirra said about religions and illusions.  I mean if a dark elf guard can tell from a mile away that I worship Quellious, why is it if I turn into an Air Elemental or something, the guards ignore my big religion tatoo and scream, "Holy Jehosiphat!  That Erudite was really an Air Elemental in disguise all this time!"  And if I can eventually lose faction with someone, and that faction loss shows through my illusion, why doesn't faction gain show through too?  You'd think if someone looks at me warmly, and every time I walk through town all the NPC's are inviting me to dinner and introducing me to their daughters, that they wouldn't suddenly freak out because their good friend Jaffa suddenly turned into a Dark elf.<P>Either make religion not matter with illusions, or give us a bonus for choosing a religion.<P>Curse of the Simple Minded: have this remove or greatly reduce the channelling ability for the target, and people may actually use it.  It is currently useless in PvE, and mostly useless in PvP.<P>Charm spells: Lower the after break taunt on Charm.  Currently, charm is too risky to use without having a Cleric and a Shaman give you all their hp buffs... and even then, you're likely gonna die before either one can get a heal off.  Lowering the after break charm wouldn't allow enchanters to solo any better than they can now, but it WOULD make them more survivable in groups and make charm a much more group friendly spell.  Something's wrong when a warrior can taunt a mob off of a cleric that just cast a complete heal, yet they can't taunt a charmed mob off of me.  You could do this by preventing a charmed mob from building up hate against a player, meaning that when charm breaks, the former pet has a hate value equal to whatever the lowest value is.  This makes it easy to taunt off of him, but doesn't help an enchanter much if he's soloing.  This would benefit ALL charming classes as well, not just enchanters.<P>Spell cannot affect creature messages: Put these on the spell so that the spell doesn't even cast against those creatures.  I mean, it's really frustrating to die because you find out that such and such creature can't be affected by the uber taunt mes spell you just cast on it, yet it cast anyway and pissed off the creature.  Same thing with charm...<P>Items: I know items aren't an issue... I just want to agree that they aren't.  A lot of enchanters are asking for higher ac, more hps, more charisma, etc.  Bah!  More AC and HPs?  We should have better spells to protect us instead.  More Charisma?  I have twice as much charisma on me right now as I have int.  Charisma items aren't that hard to find.<P>Mes: Pre-50, the mesmerize line is not overpowered at all.  If we could deal any respectable damage, or heal, THEN it would be overpowered, but since we can't, mes is our "nuke".  What I don't understand about mes is... if Verant has this divine "vision" of what a class should be, why does the vision appear to become crosseyed and 20/140 after level 50?  It seems like we serve one main purpose (crowd control) up to 50, and then we get that yanked away by having to spend loads of mana on slow casting short duration mes spells just because the others are resisted, or specifically can't affect the mobs we're fighting at a certain level.  Every class in the game (even bards in melee) can out damage an enchanter... is it so much to ask that we be undeniably the champions of crowd control?  The melee classes don't start losing hps after level 50, last I checked... why do we actually lose effectiveness each level after 50?  While we're on the subject, why are there even creatures that are immune to mesmerize in the first place?  I can understand why a giant would be immune to a normal stun, since physically stunning attacks wouldn't work so well against something that weighs 10 tons, but Mesmerize works specifically against the mind of the opponent... I mean, Giants have a brain don't they?  It should work.<P>Giving mana to others: Bad idea.  I don't want to step on the toes of Necros.  Our mana buff spells are fine the way they are... we don't need to give our mana to others.<P>Mem Blurs: These should work 100% of the time unless a monster is specifically immune to it.  And if the monster IS immune to it, it should tell us instead of casting the spell and wasting our mana.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Some addition to PvP concerns:<P>For all or nothing spells cast in PvP that save versus MR (like most enchanter spells) the MR should before applying tashan series be capped at 100. All other spells that a player casts that save versus MR, or if a MOB casts them, will feel the MR as if it were uncapped. This is the most balancing solution to the problem that spells wont ever stick, yet it is not overpowering in case people have not much MR gear on them.<P>Another solution would be Let tashania do either a lot more (that could be too powerful in case of low MR targets - well not more overpowering then unresistable dots like winged death) or just reduce the MR by a percentage (also a balanced solution).<P>It is real hard to stick anything on an even player, it is almost impossible to stick something on someone 8 levels above you.<P>Let our (already bad) dots be low (or normal) resist in PvP (leave them the same in PvE). They are on the same line as splurt yet splurt is fast and irresistable, this is slow anyways yet it is way too easy to resist it. Either this or (and)<P>Let some of our nukes be partial resist, and remove the MR *penalty* that they currently have in PvP cases.<P>Maybe remove faction hits for PvP enchanters altogether, it makes sense that they can hide their identity and slip in other cities (oh also in arena fights, duels and guild wars these faction penalties are really bad), or really really fix all the quests and thoroughly check which npcs you need to switch to betaneutral (like raine beteria, the qeynos enchantress and some others for instance). Sometimes when you are KOS there is no way out again (with quests) even not with collaboration. And class essential quests (which cant be done with a mule (i.e. tash coin) because of nodrop items - besides why do it with a mule when you should be doing it with your main).<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Ok personally my favorite part of playing the enchanter is the danger. I get a thrill off the danger vs. reward factor. I play a lvl 35 enchanter and so far I have seen nothing that really is a problem with it. Including the tashan line of spells. I love the mega taunt factor, however at higher lvls I can see where problems arise. I have no real use for illusions seeing I decided to pick a diety. A highelf in darkelf form that worships mith mar is still kos. Fine I love it! More danger. However I see the complaint that enchanter have about being "illusionist" and yet others get illusions. I think however I have come up with a theory that could solve alot of problems in 1 maybe 2 spells, that might be possible. Illusion self at lvl 51. Ok here is the idea. Call it reflection, you cast it and you have an illusion of yourself appear somewhere close by, give it 1 hp. Also giving it a 50/50 abality to trick the mob. It's not out of character, it would give the enchanter originality, be fun, and most of all effective for uber mobs, or pull teams. Still risky, not over powering at all. Example of how this could be used, you have a mob that will kill if you tashan it. Ok now what, who dies is the question, so why not answer that question a little differently. You cast illusion self, tashan, it runs toward you/or your illusion. If it picks your illusion it gives you time to get a mez off mem blur, ect. If not well ....Loading Please Wait.<P>I have an issue with enchanter drops though. Most of the enchanter drops are neither lore item or nodrop and put into really hard to get to spots. And we have very few quest items that are armor. So the problem arises with the farming of these items and them being sold for twice what they are worth because we want them. I would like to see these items become nodrop or atleast lore. For those of us who work hard to get our things. <P>As for the velious expantion, frankly if I have to sit around and hit a key to buff people every 20 minutes and there are no crowds to control, well then I won't be having very much fun there. Please rethink the magic resistance on the mobs for the enchanter class. Seeing as all of our spells are magic based it's just not quite fair to us. If I wanted to be a buff queen I would have played a shaman or a cleric. Other than that I see no "real" problems with the enchanter class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>By the way about the mezzing again, I really see no problem with making the giant flag only work for pre-50 mezzes, glamour of kintaz and rapture are balanced already by their *huge* casting costs and refresh time (only one mob can be held because of that with rapture). Rapture and Gok should imho always work except on the gods themselves. Giants should not be somehow immune to an already way underpowered spell. Granted I see why you did this with the old mez spells. But the message is 'this type of creature can not be mesmerised with *this* spell' when you cast dazzle or enthrall, so my first thought would be to take a higher level spell of the same line and mez it with that spell (glamour of kintaz). Or what spell does mesmerise them then? Gok is underpowered so why not make this work on giants too?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hello.<P>One suggestion I have is that you consider a religious faction buff so that an enchanter of Tunare could for example enter Neriak with illusion dark elf and not be KoS.<P>A gender illusion is a great idea ---make it targetable.  It would be a fun spell. If someone does not like it, he/she can click it off.<P>Perhaps a Doppleganger illusion:  You look like the target of the illusion.  Another fun spell if you target PCs, faction enhancer if you target a mob.<P>I agree with the suggestions of Zone specific random mob illusion, more class unique illusions, MAKING DEBUFFS USEFULL ON MOBS (please),and being able to enchant a weapon so that it procs for a limited time.<P>If you have read this far, thank you.

</FONT><HR>Overall - I think enchanters are quite balanced - very difficult to play, but played well can lead to many a succesful outing.<P>My issues:<P>Crowd control - If a mob cannot be mezzed (with this spell), then what spell am I supposed to be using =P.  Honestly - I hate that message - what it tells me is I have just wasted mana, increased my aggro, and lost one more ability.<P>Fix:  If a mob cannot be mezed with the spell that is being used, then give a message at time of cast, instead of letting the spell try to take effect.  For that matter, any spell that is uncastable should have this type of message - Sow, summoned dd, etc.  There is no reason to waste mana, increase taunt, and not get the effect.<P>Problem - High level mobs cannot be mezed at all with any spell.<P>Fix:  At level 54, you give us a new spell called glamour of kinatz - it is a single target 24ish second mez spell that uses like 250 mana (I'm a bit off I'm sure)  Honestly - aside from gods, this spell should be able to mez any mob there is.  Giants included.  Now being very highly magic resistant - this I can understand - resisting the mez, that I can understand - but the giant flag just doesn't make sense.  Mez is very different that stun, and should be treated differently.<P><BR>Some zones you need to take a look at enchanter wise -<BR>The hole (mobs that have the same name, yet are mezable or not randomly - level isn't an issue)<BR>Velious - too many unmezable mobs - either provide a new spell with some large restrictions to compensate or change the mobs.<P>I guess that either one or two new spells would go a long way to balance us in Velious - call them Giant Mez 1 and Giant Mez 2  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  300 mana 30 second duration 45 second recast on one - 500 mana 40 second duration 60 second recast on the other.  These spells should be able to mez any mob whether it has a giant flag or not.  I would introduce the 1st one at 49/50 and the second at 55/56.  By having two of them, this would allow an enchanter to keep 2 mobs mezed for a small period or 1 mob mezed continuously.  For the mana cost however, I would expect them to be lure like vs/ magic - i.e. no resists</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> My enchanter would really really like to see a spell that covers one's diety, for those of us stupid enough not to choose "agnostic". I made my chanter without realizing that I was gimping her by choosing a religion, and now I've come to far with her to erase her and start again.<P> There are just no benefits to choosing a religion over agnosticism when making an enchanter, and this just isn't right. When given so many options for religion at the selection screen, with no guidance as to which will help or hinder your enchanter, why should there be only one "right" answer?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hay 54 Enchanter here. personally i love playing my class. serious problem i see like many many others is insane MR. at 54 i cant get a spell to land on many mobs in the planes nevermind Sebilis. Decrease the MR maybe just a bit. sure it makes it harder but its very frustrating to cast on a mob 9 times even after tash and not get one spell to stick. basically at that point you become a mana dump for clerics and really serve no purpose. <P>Second thing is this. at 49 our mez lasts 96 seconds for 120 mana. at 59 our mez lasts 24 seconds for 400 mana. arent we supose to get upgrades to our lines? sure its resisted less but comon now. That means you have to waste 1200 mana in order to keep one mob mezed as long as you previously would have had to for 1/10 th the mana. Not to mention the extended duration in fighting time from higher level mobs. at 49 your fight will last roughly 50 seconds maybe. at 59 your fights last for 90 seconds. not only do you have to mez more often you have to mez for an extended period of time. makes sense doesnt it? <P>Speed buffs. 24 minutes on AQ 7 minutes to med up after buffing. maybe make speed last a bit longer?<P>One more thing. Mana tap or something like that. 120 mana over 2 minutes. hmmmm.. you will never get to use the full effect of that unless you cast it on a mezed mob. its like our dots.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>For the most part, I feel that Enc's are well-balanced already.  However, there are a few things that I would like to address, and why:<P>1) Increase the recasting time on our slow spells.  The reason for this is when, as an enc, I have to slow it's a backup since there is no shaman in group or he/she is oom, and as such should not be a "quick cast".<P>2) Reduce effectiveness of our slow spells.  Again, we're backups, not primaries.  This isn't our (usual) primary job, so maybe we shouldn't be so good at it.<P>3) Decrease resistance for Glamour of Kintaz and Rapture, and possibly upgrade the duration slightly of Rapture. These spells cost obscene amounts of mana and last for a very short amount of time.  As such, I think they should be resisted at a rate something like the Lure line.<P>That's about all I can think of. I love my class and think it's arguably one of the most balance classes already in the game -- we rock groups, and can't solo much better than a similar level rogue; fair enough there.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>To start off, I want to address a few points that I had while reading.<P>No, I will not be suggesting giving enchanter pets the ability to be controlled like mage pets.<P>Keep in mind that there is nobody that knows anything about EverQuest that doesn't worry that enchanters are already overpowered, even those that play enchanters.  This applies to a few other classes as well.  So keep in mind that by taking a careful look at this class, I may very well be prompted to suggest a reduction in the power of something.  This is just as important as the increase in power of things to maintain a balance.  I'm not telling you that this is my intent, just letting you know that it could happen.<P>Oh, and I know you want to make magic items.  I really, really know that.  But doing that is a big task, and takes a lot of looking at.  It's not really part of my goals for this, let's level the playing field, then we can look at magic items.<P>PixyBrat wrote:<P>&gt;"Ideas worth exploring <BR>- We need more to do at high levels against highly magic resistant mobs. Here are some comments:<BR>- This is difficult to do without unbalancing us for single group situations."&lt;<P>And this seems to be the key issue will all casters lately, with the same problems.  But enchanters have a somewhat unique problem here.  Look at the spells that you want to use; charms, mez, stun…  spells that completely change the combat.  Crowd control that works on an encounter that has, say, two monsters and is designed to be fought by twenty people…  you'd be able to cut the encounter in half!  You would, effectively, be acting as ten other characters.<P>So I'm sure you can see why it's going to be a challenge to change things like this, and you can see why these powers are limited.  Enchanters, though, have several backup things to do, and this helps a lot.  Buffs and such keep you busy (yes, but not as 'challenged' as you are when you are doing crowd control), and it adds a lot to the party.  Hastes and mana regen are very, very effective tools.<P>&gt;"- Suggestion 1: A pet similar to the cleric hammer pet. This would be a non magic based dot. Make it expensive so it's clear this is for situations where we can't otherwise use our mana effectively. Make its damage in line with pet classes at that level, because it's expensive, temporary, and we're not doing anything else. Don't make it look like our sword pet, that's confusing. Suggestion: make it look like the caster, that would be cool! Or, make it look like the mob, but with smaller size / different texture, so there isn't confusion."&lt;<P>Heh, the funny part here is that clerics and wizards already have a spell like this, and they seem to be the classes that should not get them.  I'm curious as to how this is necessary for an enchanter, considering that you already have a pet (though not one that you can control…)?<P>&gt;"- Suggestion 2: Our rampage line does not stack with other strength spells. It should. Most tanks want strength buffs all the time."&lt;<P>Well, we'd have to look at the total power of stacking all those strength buffs, not just at the convenience of allowing them to stack.  But I can add it to the list.<P>&gt;"- Suggestion 3: Examine the resistance rates of mobs to mes at level 55+, especially in velious."&lt;<P>Yup.  I sorta figured that this would be #1.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">   I can't see how this missed even my cursory list above.<P>&gt;"- Illusions are not truly a balance issue, but for the happiness of enchanters, we'd appreciate some more variance here. They don't unbalance us either! <BR>- Some kind of visual feedback that a mob is messed would be nice"&lt;<P>Both noted.<P>ErikTorvald wrote:<P>&gt;"Interestingly enough I do not understand why BOG and the Illusion: Werewolf spell do not have the same effects. Personally I would like to see Werewolf for the enchanter changed to the effects in BOG."&lt;<P>You want your spell to act like a swamp?<P>Sorry, but I just don't have time to look up any of these abbreviations that I don't already know…<P>&gt;"I would like to see Illusions: Wolf changed such that it has the effect of the lowest level sow. "&lt;<P>I am very much against the idea that we do anything further to dilute the classes.  I, personally, won't endorse this idea.  But I'll add it to the list.<P>Saige wrote:<P>&gt;"well, if enchanters can change their appearance to that of another race, how about switching gender? not really *useful* but it would be kinda fun."&lt;<P>Got it.<P>&gt;"also, (and i'm not trying to step on mage's toes here, honest!) it would be neat if an enchanter could actually enchant a weapon for use by another player. it would require a hard to get component, give the weapon a choice of decreased delay, increased attack, make it magic, or mebbe even a proc, and the weapon would not be NO RENT."&lt;<P>Enchanted items, check.  (sorry if I sound curt here, but I'm remembering most of these ideas from recent enchanter threads, and I can't figure out why I didn't already have them on my list).<P>Sandiwen said:<P>&gt;"Have to agree, there is something WRONG with the way the lull line of spells work. I've only found one place, Solusek Eye, where it ever works... Most of the time it's just a train-bringer."&lt;<P>Lull resisted too much.  Got it.<P>Axterix wrote:<P>&gt;"Let me chuck up most of an e-mail I sent you with some of the issues..."&lt;<P>Better to put stuff here than in e-mail.  I'm going to be paying more attention to posts and the responses to them than to e-mail.  It's important for me to see more than what one person thinks… not that the one person will be wrong, but more is merrier.<P>&gt;"Glamour of &lt;some anagram here&gt;: this spell would have the duration and casting cost of glamour of kintaz. It would only work on critters level 55 and below. But it works on giant flag critters. This would enable enchanters to crowd control somewhat against giant type mobs, but at a high mana cost."&lt;<P>Ok, so a mez that will work on stuff that can't be mezzed now, but costs so much (or has a long recast) that you will NOT be able to chain cast it to keep more than, say, one mob of this type mezzed?  I know that's not exactly your suggestion, but something of that type might work…  It would have to be a 53+ level spell, and even so I see a problem with this spell in the old world, with encounters like Vox…  So I dunno.<P>&gt;"Absor's Animation: …"&lt;<P>Heh.  Again, it sounds like your suggesting just about why came out of the wizard and cleric threads, a 'pet' that is essentially a melee DoT.<P>*shrug*  I'll add it.  I'm still having mixed emotions about the whole idea, especially since it's really a new spell entirely, but what the heck.<P>&gt;"There is a bard only lute with illusion werewolf, Lute of the Howler. It needs to no longer drop. Let those that already exist continue to do so"&lt;<P>I can hear the muted screams of distant bards now…<P>Group elemental spells are interesting.

I've gone over this many times with the coders, and it's not going to happen any time soon.  I'll have it on the list, as a reminder, but don't expect it.<P>Major Illusion… well, contrary to popular belief, we don't generally remove things just to piss people off.  I don't know why the size was changed, but I bet the reason had something to do with the game engine.  I'll ask.  But if that problem still exist, then there will be no major illusion (and big illusions probably will never move – that's why the treeform does not move, it causes trouble with the world geometry to try to move a model that wasn't built to move in the firstplace).<P>Illusion armor.  Instead, how about just adding an illusion component to the existing armor spells?<P>Illusion face can go on the list.  I'm guessing that there will be a technical reason for not doing it, though.  I have no idea…<P>&gt;"note, another fun spell : Voice Graft"&lt;<P>This is the place to bring it up.  I'll add it to the list.  But keep in mind that it's another one of those kinda class defining spells (not in any major way), so it might be left where it is.<P>Wyrdrana said:<P>&gt;"Whirl til you hurl and Dyn's Dizzying Draught. High resist combined with it breaking fast (supposedly a bash/slam/stun from anyone else will instantly break it) makes it unfeasible to use. It also has a slow casting time.

I think these should've remained uniquely Necromancer spells. Of course, I'm in the minority here and so it's unlikely that it will change, but that's just my opinion."&lt;<P>Well, your opinion matches mine, so it can't be all bad.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Inaros_of_Quellious wrote:<P>&gt;"Is there anything that can be done to fix the bug in the size you appear when using illusions?

Being a huge gnome or a tiny lizard is pretty cool to me.  I'll add it to the list, as it probably really is a bug.  But I think it's kinda cool, myself.<P>AlgaraOffkey said:<P>&gt;"On the illusions dropping at zone thing. Please leave that as is. As a bard with my illusion masks, there are times I need to zone to drop em. I can't really walk around FV as an iksar..."&lt;<P>Educate me on this.  Can't you just click the illusion off?<P>&gt;"Mez is currently fine as is in most areas, but I agree with whoever it was that said targetted mez should simply not be allowed like anti-undead DD so mana is not wasted on targets that can't be effected."&lt;<P>I, actually, disagree with this.  Partially due to the mechanics of it.  The undead only spells have to check to see if the target is undead to see if it works at all.  This is easy to report back.  If I'm correct on how mez works (and you all know I might not be), there are just some monsters with a really high resist to it.  So it's not checking the same way as a undead only spell (though, somehow, that doesn't sound right, and I'll look into it).  But, mostly, I always thought that it was good that the enchanter had to know what he was doing.  Making the class hard to play by forcing the player to actually know what the heck he or she is doing has always made the good enchanter player much better than the bad enchanter player.  With enchanters more so than nearly any other class (though it could be said of bards too).<P>Either way, I'll add it to the list.<P>Utaman wrote:<P>&gt;"Singe Target Mez/AE mez overwriting bug: With the risk of opening Pandora's box over this again, let me give you a little history on the big tiff this set off.

Seems like it should be possible... then maybe enchanters wouldn't have to be 99% agnostic."&lt;<P>Normally I would pass this one.  But you got me thinking.  You see, I'm perfectly fine with enchanter suffering like everyone else with their religious choices.  But, well, they aren't anymore because by now every single new enchanter is being told by their mentors to restart their characters as agnostic.  That's something that I don't like at all.  Hmm…<P>I'll add the idea of a mask faith spell to the list and see how the discussion goes internally.  It should be fun.<P>&gt;"Cantana (a bard song) and Clarity should either stack or not stack... either let us cast clarity while the song is still playing or don't let them stack at all."&lt;<P>I was under the impression that they always stacked…  I'll look into it.<P>Ellaar_TZ wrote:<P>&gt;"To be honest, I feel that the enchanter class is a little overpowered in the early levels."&lt;<P>This is something that seems to be true.  It is always possible that close examination of any class will result in a 'nerf'.  But I'm convinced that this whole thing needs to be done, and if balance can be achieved (as vague as it is) by a nerf, then I will support the nerf as strongly as I support an increase in power (which, oddly, does not have a snappy name like 'nerf'…).<P>&gt;"1. PvP"&lt;<P>Right now, I'm not looking at PvP issues.  I'm certainly in agreement that there are plenty of issues.  But I think we need to look at making the standard game as balanced as we can before moving to the PvP stuff.  So, please, hang onto these ideas and give them back to me later.<P>&gt;"-Blanket of Forgetfulness. This spell is supposed to be unresistable, but it's not. It has a huge casting cost, annoying message to everyone around the area and it just doesn't have the effect it's suppose to have."&lt;<P>Well, my first thought is, how do you know that it is supposed to be unresistable?  I find it unlikely that any spell is supposed to be unresistable.  I'll ask about it, though.<P>Marnes wrote:<P>&gt;"-It would be sweet to see if charmed mobs would have their name in yellow, and mezzed mobs would have their name in orange (or other colors)."&lt;<P>This is another one of those things that I'm kind of against.  It sort of makes the art of playing and playing with an enchanter simple (or more simple, anyhow).  But it will go on the list.<P>Sutatnac wrote:<P>&gt;"- Collaboration doesn't seem to have any affect in Skyfire, but it does in Kael Drakkal. I'm assuming this is a bug."&lt;<P>Might be.<P>&gt;"- Boon of the Garou - I'm assuming this spell was meant to only be cast on one person at a time since you can't have it on 2 people constantly. Is there a way of making the spell last 30 minutes but making it so you can only have it on one target? "&lt;<P>I see.  So if the intent was to only have it work on one person, then raise the duration and the recast time to match (along with the mana cost), so that it's not as annoying to keep it up on that one person.  Ok, that makes sense.<P>Magious said:<P>&gt;"The above suggestion of not letting us mez or charm something that is unmezzable or uncharmable by giving us a message before the casting happens is a great idea. Similar to trying to drain mana from a melee mob we get a message that says "Your target has no mana to effect" A message for uncharmable or un mezzable mobs would help alot in stoping enchanters from dying needlessly."&lt;<P>I certain that I mentioned that I would add this to the list before.  But just in case I didn’t…  I'll add this to the list.<P>Inkantra said:<P>&gt;"Many old-timers (beta 4) remember when minor illusion was a very powerful spell. You could illusion into the entire Felwithe castle, buildings, statues, etc. LARGE objects.

Thanks.  And under that circumstance, it seems like it would be a great high level illusion.<P>carmageddon wrote:<P>&gt;"Charm Bugs:<BR>Please fix the charm bug (specifically in Kael) that will not allow pet commands to be accepted by most giants. <BR>Have charm clear the agro list (specifically in Kael), so my newly aquired pets do not continue to beat up on my party memebers.

</FONT><HR>Okay, 3 pages and I have to go home now, so I'll post my point now, and hope nobody else makes it redundant.  Mind you, much of it has been said, but I think my perspective is unique.<P>I see two balance issues with enchanters.  The first is that in certain (mostly Kunark) dungeons we are "essential".  The second is that in certain (mostly Velious) zones we are "useless".  While I have arguements with both of these statements, there IS a problem here.<P>Enchanter's are too effective relative to other casters in some situations.  Other casters need to be more effective in places where a party might be overwhelmed by numbers.  At the same time, if you create areas where enchanters cannot impact most critters (see all the Velious comments), there has to be something that they can add to the group DURING THE FIGHT.  It would be just fine to buff and med like the cleric, if like the cleric I could stand up in the middle of the fight and save somebody's life.<P>I don't have a solution for either of these problems, but I think that togather they form the major balance issue that involves enchanters.  I think Velious was an attempt to address the dominance of "pull and mez" tactics, and while it did do that, it also leaves too many enchanters feeling useless.<P>One line summary.  Every class ought to have at least one reliable way to effect every monster during the fight.<P>Oh, tell your webmaster to quit spawning the cookie request everytime this site refreshes the ad banner.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Alan,<BR>If you had done this “talk” a couple months ago, we would have given you a different response than what we are saying now.  We were content with our favorite class.  It was powerful, challenging, unique, and above all, special.  We had our problems and frustrations, like everybody else, but that was part of the fun this class offered.  When we overcame those obstacles, we found out those problems taught us how to play the class better.  Even that stupid, uncontrollable pet taught us a few things about crowd control and grouping. If you haven’t played an Enchanter before, then you’ve missed out on the incredible rush that crowd control gives…and if you have, you know exactly what I’m talking about.  And when you end up in one of those “Holy %^&#!” fights, when you come out on top and a group mate says, “Enchanters rock!”, they aren’t cheering your character…they’re cheering you.  Gordon Winn once described Enchanters, after the pet nerf, as a “quiet” group, and we were a quiet group, we were too busy having fun to complain.  Of all the classes in EQ, Enchanters had it good, until…<P>It took a while after Velious was launched.  We wandered around in Iceclad, Eastern Wastes, and Great Divide, and Kael Drakkel.  Oh sure, there were plenty of Giants running around, which we can’t mez, but we knew that coming in.  It wasn’t until we started filtering into the higher level dungeons that we found out…Enchanters got slapped down, and slapped down hard.  We found out that not only were our most powerful spells useless here, but all of our offensive spells were useless.  If we go to Velious, it’s to do one job, and one job only, buff everybody else with haste and Clarity.<P>Velious was the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back.  Enchanters are now insecure about their position in Norath, and perhaps a little paranoid.  In Velious, crowd control was treated as an exploit, much like kitting, and programmed against.  Now we sit wondering if the nerf bat is going to get pulled out, and our favorite class is going to be beaten silly with it.  I’m not saying that you’re planning on nerfing crowd control.  I don’t know what your company’s plans are.  But now, when I’m in Sol B, or over in Kunark, every time I “hear” someone yell “Enchanter’s rock!” I’ll turn my head to the south, and say to myself, “They did it once.  They can do it again.”<P>Useless and inefficient spells<BR>The Enchanter class probably has the largest collection of spells, but that also means they have the largest collection of useless spells.  Some spells were good ideas that never really worked.  Others are situational spells, where a situation where they would be useful, was never found.  One spell has a problem with the cost of casting it, versus the benefit it gives.  And there are a couple spells which are “broken as intended.”<BR>Lull Series<BR>The Lull series (Lull [1], Soothe [8], Calm [20], Pacify [39], and Wake of Tranquility [51]) is supposed to reduce the reaction radius of any mob it’s cast on, and allow nearby mobs to be pulled without agroing the “lulled” mob.  All of the spells are single target, except Wake, which is an AoE.  I say supposed to because these spells have a high resist rate, as high or maybe higher as an Enchanter’s nuke (before applying Tash).  Since Tashing a mob before Lulling isn’t an option (Tash is an agro spell) and a resisted Lull agroes the mob, usually pulling all the nearby mobs as well, the spell is utterly useless.  Compare this with the Druid’s spell, Harmony [5], which is an AoE and is totally irresistible (there is no resistance check), but has the restriction of outdoor only.<P>It would be nice if these spells could be made irresistible (or “nearly” irresistible), or reduce the resists on the spell and eliminate the risk of agroing the mob.  Otherwise, please consider removing the line of spells from the game.  After all, what is the point of having these spells in the game (and what IS the point of adding another in the RoK expansion) if we aren’t supposed to use them?<BR>Strength Debuffs<BR>Enchanters have to lines of strength debuffing spells, the Weaken series (Weaken [1], Ebbing Strength [12], Feckless Might [20], Insipid Weakness [34], and Weakness [44]), which reduces strength only, and the Enfeeblement series (Enfeeblement [4], Disempower [16], Listless Power [29], Incapacitate [44], and Cripple [53]), which reduces Strength, AC, Agility, and sometimes Stamina and Dexterity.<P>The spells are situational, however we have never found a situation where they would be useful.  By the time we get the opportunity to use these on  “normal” mobs (old world and Kunark), the mob is already half dead, and when we were finally faced with mobs that had more fight in them (Velious) the spells were resisted as much as our other spells.<P>I don’t have any ideas about what to do with these spells, but I thought I’d mention them.<BR>Whirl and Dyn’s<BR>These spells (Whirl till you hurl [12] and Dyn’s Dizzying Draught [29]) were supposed to be 12 second, single target stuns, which were supposed to spin the target like a top (Cast this spell on a player and you’ll see the animation.)  Dyn’s also has debuffing qualities to it, as well.  The problem is these spells are instantly broken by any other stun, be it spell or slam/bash.<P>How about changing them from a stun to a root, plus debuff.  Give them the duration of a similar level root spell, and the same limitations.  And please, put in the animation.<BR>Curse of the Simple Mind<BR>This is a level 29 spell, which reduces the intelligence and wisdom of the target by 15 to 20 points.  The only effect, this spell has, is to remove one spell’s worth of mana from the target, IF the target is at full mana already.  If the target has already cast one spell, then the debuff is useless.<P>How about, instead of an Int/Wis debuff, something that temporarily impairs the target’s ability to cast spells.  In exchange, the spell would be resisted every tick, like charms.<P>A second option would be to make this spell strengthen the effects of charms (read make them a little more reliable).  In this case, the spell would have a short duration, like 15 to 30 seconds.  Both options would have a long (2 minute) recast time.<BR>Rune IV<BR>Rune IV [44] has a 71% increase in damage absorption over Rune III [34] (164 points), but at an increase of 1,234% in reagent costs (10p for Peridots vs. 7g for Jaspers.)  Compare that with the 95% increase (112 points) Rune III has over Rune II [24], for a 50% increase in reagent cost (7g for Jaspers vs. 5g for Bloodstones,) and the 115% increase (63 points) Rune II has over Rune I [16], for a 150% increase in reagent cost (5g Bloodstones vs. 2g Cats Eye Agates.)<P>And before you ask the same question you asked the Clerics.  The answer is no, we do not get reimbursed for this expense.  These are out of pocket expenses, which everybody considers the cost of doing business.<BR>Boon of Garou<BR>I won’t bore you with the stuff everybody else is complaining about, but I will ask you this question.  Why, in the name of all that is holy, does this illusion proc a life tap?  Talk about blurring the line of class distinction.<BR>Velious<BR>We are not having fun!  If you’re going to put insane levels of magic resistance on mobs, please give us some way to chip down that resistance.  Enchanters and Clerics are the only two classes that have no offensive spells that aren’t based on magic.  Put Enchanters in a zone full of magic immune mobs, and I’ll show you and Enchanter whose only job is to buff all the other players with Clarity and haste all night.  Oh boy!  Oh joy!<P>Trivial issues<BR>These aren’t balance related and this is more a wish list of new toys, but this is as good a time as any to bring them up.  Perhaps you can set them aside for later consideration.<BR>Illusions<BR>Unless you’re playing an agnostic Dark Elf, illusions really don’t play that big of a role in an Enchanter career.  Maybe this is a sad commentary on these spells, maybe not.  Anyway, here are some ideas that would be nice to see.<BR>Remove the outdoor only restriction on Illusion: Sprit Wolf<BR>Spirit Wolf was made outdoor only, when it was discovered that Enchanters were using the spell for corpse recovery in Vox and Naggy raids.  Since then, the faction issues have been fixed.  Please remove the outdoor only restriction.<BR>Exchange the melee buffs on Illusion: Werewolf for regeneration<BR>Since the melee abilities of Enchanters at this level are, shall we say, useless, the melee buffs (+Str, +ATK, and haste stackable with other haste spells) this illusion provides are a sick joke.  Could we trade those buffs in for a modest regeneration, maybe two or three points per tick?<BR>Illusions for pets<BR>It’s pretty clear, you don’t want us casting illusions on other players (Boon of Garou is proof enough of that.)  How about letting us cast illusions on our pets?  There aren’t any faction, balance or game play issues involved, and some of the master/pet illusion combinations could be worth a good laugh or two.<BR>Pets<BR>Allow 39+ pets to attack the first mob its master attacks<BR>An Enchanter walks up to a mob, equips his or her weapon, and takes a swipe at the monster.  The animation, seeing this happen, gets its pea sized brain working and thinks, “Oh, my master wants me to attack this… Okay.” and proceeds to go to work.  This won’t really help much for soloing, but could provide some use for pets in group situations, without forcing the Enchanter to risk death.<BR>Allow /pet get lost to suicide the pet or break charm<BR>This is really more of a convenience issue.<BR>Lack of interesting quests<BR>All caster classes suffer from this.  The typical caster quest is a scavenger hunt for rare items.  It has very little in the line of a plot, let alone tell the story about the class’ history.  Take the coin of Tash quest, for example.  The only thing we know about one of Norath’s greatest Enchanters is…he is an avid coin collector.  WHAT A LOSER!  In fact, the only caster we know anything about, Miragul, is for a PALADIN quest.  Come on!<BR>Lack of uniqueness in appearance<BR>I am SICK of robes!  An Enchanter looks like a Wizard looks like a Magician looks like a Necromancer.  Can you please look into taking any new resources you find available, and using some to give these four classes a make over?<BR>A new class only “trade” skill called Enchanting<BR>Something I would have liked to see was make enchanting items a skill, much like Alchemy and Poisons.  For an example, to make an enchanted silk robe, a tailor would make two silk swatches and pass them to an Enchanter.  The Enchanter would then place them, one at a time, in their enchanting kit, along with a vial of viscous mana and any number of other ingredients (like spiderling legs?), and if their skill is high enough, and they get lucky, they come out with two enchanted silk swatches.  The swatches would be passed back to the tailor, who would then make the final product.  The higher level the vial of mana means the more powerful enchantment would be put on it, but the high level of skill would be needed for a chance at success.<P>The idea is to push Enchanters away from the other trade skills, by making them invest time and money, and maybe even skill points, into a separate skill.  It would also introduce an element of risk into the enchantment “process”.<P>An enchantment skill could also be used by Enchanters to make reagents for more powerful spells (like a super MR debuffer).  Imagine if an Enchanter, in order to cast one of their offensive spells, had to have a ready supply of made reagents, and while those reagents were NOT stackable, but the ingredients to make them were.  An Enchanter would be spending part of their down time preparing for the next fight.  Also, imagine the Enchanter sitting right next to the Necromancer in the newbie area auctioning for stacks of frogs whiskers and chicken lips.  If you want to be the master of reducing down time, you have to pay for it with a little down time of your own.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Enchanters rule, I love the class.  They are difficult at low levels but the reward for the difficulty is worth it.  Enchanters from level 40-55 are extremely powerful.  However in REGULAR SoV encounters we start to become "buff dispensers," our main line of spells becomes useless.<P>1. Fix Umbra<P>2. Remove the "giant" flag on non-giant SoV mobs.  Rapture, our highest level spell should be able to mez about anything other then REAL giants/dragons.  Why do I get "Your target cannot be mezmerized by this spell" when using my Level 59 mez on a creature the size of a Gnome's big toe? (See mobs in PoG).  Why can't I mez Golems in Velkators Labrynth, or some rats/bats in Necropolis or Dwarfs in Thurgadin or stuff in Sky Shrine.<P>If your not going to change the lame restriction to our CC spells then how can an enchanter help in these situations.... We are already useless at Epic Encounters(99% of our spells are magic based, tash isn't but why even cast it on a magic immune mob, mana sieve is useless on a level 60 mob who has 230948234 mana and we can only drain 200-400ish), now we are useless LEADING UP TO these epic Encounters too.  At level 60 I don't want to be a Clarity/Speed dispenser.<P>3.  Fix the high level memblurs.  There is no reason to use any memblur other then Blanket of Forgetfulness because it is the only one that has multiple wipse that works.  The level 50+ memblur is an absolute joke, it should completely wipe the hate list 90% of the time for the mana it costs.<P>4.  Give us a charm inbetween Dictate and Boltrans.  Dictate is a wonderful spell and comes in very handy now because of Verants lame Giant Flag on half the SoV mobs.  However the long recast time and high mana means we can only do be effect in Crowd Control for a short period of time.  Adding another "regular" charm line of spells around 56-67 would help a lot.<P>5.  High level Tash's taunt, while AE Tash's taunt is much less it is still very risky to use because untaunted mobs will still really hate you.<P>6.  Enchanter SoV robe, Necro's get a level 57 spell, we get a post 50 one that is a waste of money, thanks.  How about Rune5, or clarity 2, or Gift of Brilliance, or even Dazzle, heck I'd even be happy with Illusion: Air Elemental (for levitate).<P>Post 50 levels in SoV are a huge change for enchanters, and with not much to fall back on when we can't crowd control or hit mobs with our magic only based spells we become pretty useless, unwanted, and reduced to only buffers.<P>As for illusions, more would be nice.  Maybe you could code in some that wouldn't use new models, for example: Illusion: Gender (stacks with other illusions), Illusion: Leather, Plate, Steel (gives the look of full Leather, Plate, Steel, stacks with other illusions).<P>Anyways, thanks for letting us vent, hopefully something positive will come out of it.  I want my mez back *cry*.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My biggest issue isn't about spells are abilities, it's a game play issue. Enchanters are the one class who really don't get any use out of assist. I have a K6-2 500 with a Voodoo 5 and when I went to Kunark I had to reduce the screen resolution because the mouse was moving too slowly to target effectively. It would be nice if tab would switch between NPCs that are overlapping. It's very frustrating to have my ability limited by my external issues. I just want to be able to separate 2 mobs without tedious and slow pixel hunting.<P>My other request is just a wish - I'd like to have a stun shield similar to a damage shield. Something that'd give just enough time to escape a bad situation.<P>Finally I'd like to comment that the most fun thing about playing an Enchanter is Crowd Control, and as has been commented in the posts above there are several places where it's pretty much useless. Bah, no fun. Okay, there go my 2 cents.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>We all know that haste and clarity are important skills. We are all glad that we have them. However, when buffing people is the only thing you are competent at upper levels it gets boring quick. I am glad that you realize this is an issue for every caster in the high level game. The game has to be fun for everyone even at the high levels of the game. It is not acceptable to have the tanks fight and all the casters sit back and watch. Let us be involved, let us do what we used to do. Let wizards, mages and necros do damage as effectively as pre Velious. Let enchanters do crowd control as pre Velious. In short let everyone feel involved. I realize you are just a spokesperson but please let it be known to the powers that be that everyone should be ACTIVELY involved even at the high level game. As it is currently you are going to lose enchanters in groves. Enchanters were used to being an integral part of the action. Now, you are asking them to be basicaly spectators. For a great many that will not sit well.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Yes alot of this has been covered as I have read most posts, but I would like to put my own spin on a few of the mentioned ideas and perhaps give a few new ones...<P>First off to address our line of spells:<P>Rune IV - cost is way to high for the damage it absorbs. I Personally still use rune III and will til I get rune V. I suggest changing the rune IV cost to no more than a wolf's eye agate, perhaps just 2 or 3 jaspers.<P>Mez series - Hey what can I say it is one of our little niche's. What I would like to see is perhaps another AE mez (not aware of any in the 50+ catagory and there are none below) only AE mez I am aware of is level 16 and though it doesn't get used as often at the higher levels because the duration is only 30 seconds, it would be with increased duration.<P>Debuffs - Speed debuffs are fine as is, but ones such as cripple are barely noticable if at all on regular mobs. Nice dueling spells to annoy tanks but thats about the only time I even bother to mem them.<P>Illusions - Though only used as a faction modifier most of the time. I agree that they should stay through zones and link deaths. Also more illusions would be nice if not just for amusment.<P>Now to move on to the equipment catagory. I have seen a few posts metioning how bad our spells taunt which any enchanter worth thier salt is used to. I would howerver like to see some enchanter specific armor with higher AC. If we can taunt as well as tanks with our spells maybe we should up our AC a bit more than regular int casters.<P>Finally I will adress genral issues.....<BR>What can I say? I have been playing an enchanter as my main for a long time and I can't find any real problems other than minor tweaks. I wouldn't mind our illusions to truely make us as though we were one of that race instead of our religion interfering. I chose to follow the Marrs for mine and although I did nothing to affect my faction one way or another I still am threatining to a few trolls and ogres (easily fixed by benevalonce), but I am assuming that they see through the illusion to my religion though I never truely affected faction.<BR>Only one other complaint is the inability to mez any large creatures (giants, wurms, ect..) something needs to be done about that.<P>Narith Trumystic<BR>47th Season Human Enchanter<BR>Brell Serillis</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oh,..forgot something important,..research. Absor,...its rediculous to hve all your components for that 24 lvl spell and you can't get it to combine till 29 or later. Most Enc's i know relied on other high lvl ones to do their research for them. This could be trivial(no pun intended),...but i think it's wrong that i can't research the current lvl spell until the next spell set,...and in some cases,...i.e. 29 lvl feedback spell,...not until 44,...it just doesn't make sense. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Most of everything that needs to be said about enchanters has already been hashed and rehashed, and I'm not in much of a position to add to the conversation in any significant way since virtually all of the major gripes center around the post 50 game and I know nothing about that.. But:<P>Here's a spell idea for enchanters.  One thing that enchanters can do via charm, mez, mem blur, etc, is mess with a mob's aggro.  Many of these options apparently no longer work very well at higher levels.  Many enchanters are also complaining about how mobs hate them so, especially after a tash.  <P>So, why not make an all new line of spells.  Very fast cast, low mana, and limited in it's effects.  Name it something like Aura of Neglect, Aura of Forgetfullness, Aura of Ignorance, Aura of Lethe.  <P>As to it's effects, I'm not quite certain how to describe it.  From what I understand and what I can divine from the way the game seems to work, each mob has a hate list, and each character on that hate list has a numerical hate value that goes one way, that being up.  <P>Every time the character does something that miffs the monster, that number increases. Am I right, or am I way off track here?  Assuming I am right, have this new spell cause the player that it is cast on to go DOWN on every mobs hate list.  In other words, if JoeBob Whackersmacker has a hate value of 35 with Mob 1, and a hate value of 43 with Mob 2, and an enchanter cast aura of forgetfullness on him, he would end up with a hate value of say 33 with Mob 1 and a hate value of 41 with mob 2.  This could be done over and over to a minimum equal to base aggro (in other words, a kos monster would never totally forget a person, a non kos but aggroed monster could over successive casts decide it liked that person after all)<P>It makes total sense from a roleplaying perspective, fits in very well with the kind of spells that enchanters have, would have absolutely no effect on a solo encounter.  If the numbers were tweaked right so that it was of a very small effect (like it would take 4 casts at a 2 second cast time with a 2 second recast time, each cast taking 5-10% of total mana pool, to counteract the aggro induced from 1 complete heal), then this would GIVE ENCHANTERS SOMETHING TO DO DURING HIGH LEVEL ENCOUNTERS...  I just came up with this idea reading this thread, and I love it, love it, love it.  Obviously it would have to be implemented very, very carefully, the key would be for it to require successive casts to be very effective.  This way it would be difficult to both perform effect crowd control and cast this spell, but lacking the ability to perform crowd control the enchanter would still have an active affect on the battle requiring skill and awareness.<P>Umm, yeah, sorry, I know, I ramble on and on.  I'd really, really love to hear feedback on this idea.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Glamour of Kintaz and Rapture --  These two spells were added into Kunark as a BALANCED way to still have mez abilities at high level.  They have short durations and high mana costs but are capable of mezmerizing mobs that the lower level mez spells cannot.  This was completely IGNORED in Velious where mobs are either mezzable with Dazzle and lower or are immune to all mez spells.  In the high level game for Velious Enchanters have been reduced to casting buff spells and are played as secondary characters on an additional computer.<P>Solution : Allow Kintaz and Rapture to mez any mob in the game EXCEPT Gods and MAJOR dragons (western wastes dragosn should be rapturable) The Desginers of Velious should have taken Enchanters abilities into consideration when they desgiend the encounter in the first place...its not like they didnt know what Warriors and clerics were capable of.<P>Dictate : Very useful spell but it shouldnt be limited to only under 58th level mobs when ther are entire zones where no mob is lower than 60.  Remove the level limit on Dictate and simply add in flags to make some GOD and Boss mobs un-dictateable.<P>Lull series : Entire line of spells has never lived up to its potential...needs to be re-examined.<P>Illusions: Very dissapointing that no one connected the title "Illusionist" with maybe adding in more Illusion spells</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I read Absor's second post after I posted mine, and I've thought about it on the way home, and I have two comments.<P>First, I didn't see equipment issues in Absor's post.  There are some.<P>Second, if you power down enchanters, power down our buffs.  As seems to be widely agreed, even with no offensive ability, enchanters are welcome in groups.  Unfortunately, nobody plays the class because it has great buffs.  SOV has shown that.<P>People play enchanters because they want to cheat death.  The excitement of mezzing an overpull and living cannot be adequately described.  Part of that excitement is knowing that you are dicing with death every time.  The other part is that you win most of the time.  Right now that balance is perfect, or nearly so, at least pre-50.<P>Take the 2 mob example in Absor's post.  If we succeed, we a little less than halve the danger of the fight (after all, the tanks still have to kill it before the enchanter goes OOM).  If we fail, we delay the second mob for the five or six blows it takes to kill us.  That is what being an enchanter is all about.  Win or die.  Don't mess with that delicate balance.<P>That is why I suggested enhancing other classes to offset the enchanter's effectiveness in high mob population dungeons.  Improve AOE spells (like taking pets out of the rain) and make root/snare a better option for dungeon Crowd Control.  Give Bards a little better Crowd Control ability.  But don't reduce the enchanter's offensive abilities.<P>And I'm guessing you know that BOG stands for Boon of the Garou, but the swamp idea is kinda neat.  Sort of a persistant AOE snare, effecting anyone who wandered into it... Nah, too many problems with grief players on the blue servers.  Still a neat idea.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Aside from the class balance as a whole, an issue much larger than I want to touch, are two things I would like to have looked into.<P>1) Charm success/length. I have been thinking about this for a long time and it came to a head the other day. Here is the situation. I am a lvl 45 Enchanter, casting a lvl 39 charm spell. I have 203 charisma and the target of the spell is a lvl 14-16 iksar Bandit in Field of Bone. In about 8 attempts, only 3 were not resisted and of those three, not a single one lasted longer than 20 seconds. I have had charms last *much* longer on lvl 40 mobs than lvl 15 mobs, this just isnt right.<BR>I seriously doubt if it would be unbalancing to have a charm, from a lvl 45 caster onto a lvl 15 mob last for a half an hour. Its not like that lvl 15 mob is going to be helping me get xp or more than a handful of copper, it wouldnt last long enough for that. It WOULD be fun for RP and other issues of those type.<BR>So why not? Lengthen the length of the charm to long periods of time when the level difference is extreme.<P>2) The issue of enchanting gold bars needs to be looked into. Currently, when you cast enchant xx metal, when the spell is complete, a bar is subtracted from your inventory and pops onto your cursor. <BR>Frequently enough, when I then click on a stack of enchanted bars in my inventory, the bar dissappears off my cursor, but the stack in my inventory does not increment, effectively screwing me out of a enchanted bar (this starts to get costly with plat and velium bars).<BR>I've noticed this happens more frequently the closer the timing of the bar popping onto your cursor, and you clicking on the stack in your inventory. This may seem trivial, and people may say, well wait a few seconds to add it to your inventory. I say BS. It shouldnt happen in the first place, and when you are enchanting 100 to 200 bars to try and raise your skill one point (after the 190+ range), a few seconds per bars adds up to a decent chunk of time.<BR>Simply put, its annoying, its a bug, it shouldnt happen, and should be fixed.<P>Thanks for looking into these issues.<P>Xylen<BR>lvl 45 Enchanter<BR>Mith Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
