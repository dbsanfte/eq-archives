</FONT><HR>I would love to see the implementation of special attacks changed so that each one doesn't supercede the previous one.  Why not have kicks supercede kicks and punches supercede punches, each with their own independent delay.  Not only would that help address the damage imbalance at high levels but it would also add some very cool move sequences.  I would love to watch my monk do a Dragon Punch-Flying Kick-Double Attack-Riposte sequence :-)<P>I don't favor increasing the weight limit (masochism seems to be a necessary trait to play a monk well), but I would like to see more mid-level (non-uber) items designed for monks (ie LIGHT and good AGI/STA/AC bonus or low %-age HASTE).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello and thank you for aksing the monk community for input.  I have played both a human and an Iksar monk to 50+.  I love the monk class.  I really don't think there is much wrong with our class.  The only area that seems to have been diminished significantly is group utility.  I think group utiliy is very important for every class.  I think VI has done a commendable job defining group utility for casters over the last year.  With the addition on Summon Corpse, Translocate, Call of Heroes etc.  These spells make these classes desirable for groups especially in multigroup raids.  The single area that monks always excelled at was the pull.  That has always been our "job".  Others could pull but monks were always the best pullers.  Many of the new zones ie.  The Hole and Vellious in general has has lessened our group utility.  Can we still dish damage?  Yes.  But, I believe that all classes want to be the best at something.  It gets very boring sitting in a group and smashing keys.  So, in conclusion I would like to ask you that you add some kind of group utility not only to Monks but all classes.  And for monks, Enhance our pulling abilities or give us another "job".  I do not love monks for their sheer damage output.  The pull is why I love being a monk.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Summary from what I'm reading, main points:<P> - Increase damage<BR> - Give monks a detaunt/fix FD & uber aggro issue<BR> - Bring fists up to par with current weapons for other classes<P>Other mumbo-jumbo I feel like ranting about:<P>weight is fine, if you dont know how to twink a monk, it's your problem.  weight limitation is what makes the monk class fun IMO - not saying I'm not drooling for the wt increase on my monk in 3 bubs =P<P>Some low end weapons for low levels to keep their skills up, something along the lines of shurikens and other monkly stuff. - agree, although not a huge priority (you'll be a high lvl longer than you'll be a noob)<P>WT on weapons - fully agree - someone at VI is smoking crack to put it in a nice way.  Make the weight proportional with slashing weapons wt/str of warrior/rogue.  EX:  SSoY weighs 2.5(?) yak war club weighs 3.  lets say we have a warrior/rog with 150 str and that yak war club (cant think of a monk only weapon with similar stats).  the normal SSoY is 1/60th of a warrior/rogue's carrying limit.  the yak war club or a weapon similar should be 1/60th of a monk's carrying capability (14/18/22).  Again, I'm picking the yak war club because I cant think of a more equal weapon to the short sword of the ykesha, and those are usually pretty popular on twinks nowadays and used to be the most common high lvl weapon out there - so everyone knows them.  Feel free to replace the two weapons as needed (oggok cleaver vs tranq staff, etc =P)<P>Fosters (no longer Kegmeister)<BR>lvl 54 monk<BR>The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm going to reiterate something I said earlier, just to make me feel good.<P>With Kunark, monks became dependent on weapons to achieve max damage throughout most of their careers.  Verant has clearly recognized this with the 2HB weapons made available to monks.  However, the 1HB weapons available to monks are no where near the quality of the 2HB ones.  For instance, one of the premier low 50's weapons is the Jade Mace, usable by all melee classes.  How is a monk supposed to outdamage a warrior when they are both using the same weapon?<P>Warriors are supposed to have the most *variety* of weapons - they are not necessarily supposed to have the best weapons available in a class.  The Fighting Baton is an example of a monk weapon done right.  High level examples of this are needed.<P>Consider this - one of the main "problems" with the monk class is the fact that other melee classes keep getting 10/18 and 13/20 weapons - with no comparable weapon available to monks.  We can't outdamage them if we have inferior weapons.<P>Oh, and can more of those weapons be like our CF and modify our fists, please?  That is a great idea.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What about considering balancing Iksars with Humans. The Celestial Fist has evened the score on H2H. They have approx 40 better AC also. With the experience penalties being changed, I see no reason not to balance the races. Or at LEAST give us Humans a feature that Iksars do not recieve to even the score.

</FONT><HR>I read as much as I could of the two threads and while I could reiterate much of what my brethren have written (I have written the same myself for nearly a year now), I would like to address something that I did not see in either thread.<P>Many of the items that were initially used by monks (prior to the AC insanity) were AGI items.  Agility is claimed as helping to avoid being hit.  This is the key to monks.  As per the definition offered, monks were meant to deal damage and avoid being hit.  Sadly, the AGI function of the formula seems to be non-existent or at least extremely non-impacting.<P>A key for a monks should be the option to build up AGI to 150-200 (just like casters who build INT/WIS to gain more mana), which would help monks avoid more blows and take less damage from those blows.  AC should not be the primary factor in determining if a monk gets wailed on and how how badly.  Nearly all of our skills deal specifically with two RL skills, agility and dexterity.  <P>Agility is the ability to move and perform actions with minimal effort.  Many of our skills like dodge, block, riposte, and safe fall tend to fall in this type of category.<P>Dexterity is the ability to manipulate and perform special tasks with our hands and feet.  Our special attacks fall into this type of category.  <P>One of the ways that monks could be balanced better is to make our defensive abilities more effective and allow us to escape taking damage as opposed to forcing us to absorb the damage.  If a monk chooses to be an AGI monk, he or she should reap the benefit of being able to move swiftly and avoid blows.<P>In addition, FD should be made as a complete agro wipe that does not fail, at least not when you FD and the mob sees through it.  Falling to the ground sucks, but does balance it out.  FD could be further balanced, but making mobs leave right away (negating the FD pull aspect, although there are more techniques that just that these days) and possibly make FD impact XP gain (harsh, but if it keeps us alive in all situations, worth it).<P>Mend.  What is the purpose of having mend cap at 200?  At 101 is does not fail (DO NOT CHANGE THAT).  Perhaps a bonus should be given like reducing recycle time as it gets higher.  Maybe 5 minute recycle at 150, 4 minute recycle at 200.  Or it could be level based (5 min at 50, 4 at 55, 3 at 60).  Mend could even repair more damage at higher skill levels.<P>There are issues involving weight, damage output, and what not.  Everyone here has done an excellent job addressing those, but I felt that these points above would also be worthy of looking into... </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just a few minutes ago, I was joking with my roommate about this whole discussion.  I, of course, support Monkly Business completely.  I think combo's would be great.  I mean, don't make a 11 attack combo common at all (Quad, FK+DP+TS+EC+RK+K+Riptose...sweet). I think the idea is great, and would focus on what a monk really is.<P>How about this:<P>Instill Doubt- Little use as is, and I consider myself very skilled at using it.  Scare non-socials and take much less damage.  But what if when we Instill a mob and stop attacking it, or instill and feign, the mob returns to it's point.  An accompanying message: 'A_scaredymob_00 turns tail and runs.' or 'Mob_01 cuts its losses.'  I guess the use of this would be to get out of a battle that you can't handle.  Make it rare.  That'd be nice though.<P>Zwaloo<P>Versukas Defthands 30 Monk<BR>Terris Thule<P>P.S. I can see how that last bit could unbalance the game, and I understand that you reap what you sow I.E. entering into a battle you take the good with the bad.  But if we can feign, maybe we can take the chance of saving the whole party, not just our hides.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Another EASY to implement change that would greatly increase monk satisfaction without over powering would be to change the effect of ID from fear to a similar duration stun. <P>I support that humans should be given some sort of attack or haste bonus over Iksar in all cases (not just empty handed) to make up for the substantial AC difference.<P>I also support what Bodi has posted.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Give us some weapons in velious, Nothing monk only from there but crap.  I'd like to see monk only 1hb's that are really nice.  I hate having to give up a high dual wield cap to use a good 2hander, Dont like using fists i think 1hb's are cool, and procs are just awesome.  Give us a good 1hb, slap 100 blows on it, give good ratio high delay for offhand, give us good mainhand 1hb, good proc on it, personally would like maybe a DD, or debuff with a antitaunt on it, opposite war epic.  And put them on some uber mobs.<BR>3. I like some the armor coming from velious for monks, but thats all we getting. Ice burrower hide looks like crap, and I think having every monk wearing cured silk is just lame.  And people dont like my guardian robe;(<BR>4. I'd like one of the following, Little bit more hps, triple attack at 59 or 60, or some other things to make us more offensive.  Currently rogues /own monks hardcore in damage, and lvl 60's warriors are close..I have many logs that show that, from long battles(velketor, yelinak, ect).<BR>5.Balance iksars and humans, currently iksars own humans hands down.  Iksar same level worse gear has a ton more ac then me, better vision, and regen that owns me.  human monks should get something along lines of, extra hps, higher ac bonus from being a monk, higher skill caps, better regen then currently, or create some nice weapons monk only that are a little better then i previously stated and human only.<BR>6.Cant think of anything right now<BR>jalan420@hotmail.com</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, first I've played a monk since P4 beta.  I love my monk and I haven't played him much since RoK came out.  The reason is there is no longer a need for the class.  The other two pure melee classes can out damage a monk and both can out live a monk in a battle due to the fd nerfs.  The other reason is I didn't make a monk to use weapons and hunt for armor.  If I'd wanted that I'd have made a warrior or a rogue.  Now with my level 40 monk I can't do the damage I should without resorting to weapons.  I guess monks aren't the masters of melee damage and they are the masters of unarmed combat the only problem is unarmed combat is completely obsolete.<P>The next problem is the casters that were brought in with SoV are such that if you have a monk and he's fighting with a cobalt drake and the drake procs the ae spell the monk dies.  Even my necromancer can survive one or two of the procs and has some chance of getting a fear on the beasty.  As it is now the drake gets with in spell range which is (caution hyperboli) somethink like a quarter of the zone away and poof you the monk drop dead.<P>The solutions to this is give us natural resistances that go up with our levels.  Make our fists and feet our primary weapons again not some poor sister that we use when going to retrieve our bodies.  And MAKE FEIGN DEATH WORK.  I can't stress that last one enough.  If I can't feign when a mob is beating me to a bloody pulp get rid of the goddamn skill it's worthless and give me back the practice points i put into it so i can train in a weapons skill.  The last thing is the weight limit.  I rather liked the weight limit when i could get mesh and run around and not loot cause all I needed to play was some food/water/bandages but I can't do that anymore cause you've made the monk weapons required and nearly impossible for a monk to get.  Ever seen a monk on the receiving end of an ice commet?  So other classes get the monk only weapons and are selling them for 6 to 30k pp now was this crap in the VISION(tm)?  Monk weapons should all be no drop and should be obtainable by a monk which means a monk has to serve some function in a group.  That I'll leave up to you since puller is also not in the VISION(tm).  You guys built this universe where like the real world ambushes are very effective now you don't want us to use them.  I still don't understand the rational behind that.<P>Ramladi Ironclaw lvl 40 monk<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Add something like opposite of war defensive, we hit more and hit for closer to max damage more, dual and dbl atk more for like 2 minutes.  Give our 56 disc, so that every swing hits.  Uhm how about a disc like offensive upgrade, that lowers your hate while doing more dmg, disc that makes us regen a ton for like a minute or so, or how about a defensive type disc for us that warriors get but not as good, we are masters of melee..hmmm well had a few other things just cant think of it right now...<BR>Saolor <BR>56th Monk Povar<BR>Triton</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Fix FD please.... its my only complaint in 55 levels of monkdom.<P>1) Mobs in Vellios and high level mobs everywhere have an ability to ignore feign.  If you are selected by a boss mob, or sometimes even just a high level mob (Kael protectors, etc) they can keep hitting you after you feign.  No falling to the ground message, no spells breaking feign, no feign with attack left on.  They simply ignore it.  If this is as intended, we need to know why our main monkly skill is ignored by certain mobs.<P>2) Insta return mobs.  We spent hours and hours attepmting to split Tormax's guard area, every time 3 were pulled and the monk feigned the mobs instantly return in a large pack.  None hang around a second to chain or split in any way.  This was obviously put in on purpose to nerf our pulling abilities, and i think its silly.  These mobs are hard enough to defeat, and with raid party size limits imposed by your new 2800 server max Linkdeath system, it just makes some places too hard to be worth doing.<P>3) Mob casting time has been inscreased in vellios, making feign once again nerfed as a side effect.  Pulling the Prophets and priests are in Kael is a nightmare, the mobs have a 6-10 second casting time. Meaning when there are 3 you are trying to split, at least one is constantly casting on you, making feign impossible.  Once again i believe this was done as a stealth nerf, and most monks arent currently aware of it.<P>-Phestus<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok. Basically the "new and improved" monk will have damage right in between warrior and monk. Only thing is, for a class concept as cool as monk, that's kinda just settling for something. Personally, since we're not the "damage masters", nor the hitpoint gods, I'd like us to be SOMETHING. Here's my proposal- we be the masters of melee combat, but not in the sense of damage, rather stuns- minor at most times of course- perhaps some AoE attacks basically anything in combat other than being pure damage machines. <P>Our stunning abilities should be viable at very least in the mid-level range, minor stuns of course, but beneficial to any fight. It fits in with the concept, one with ultimate control over one's attacks and body, able to execute very precise strikes and blows to his opponent. This would probably be done with a clickable ability, dealing perhaps somewhat low damage, giving the monk the choice whether to stun, or to continue his normal, high damage attacks. <P>Perhaps the way a monk should be seen as is the antithesis to the caster class, in every sense of the word, powerful physical abilities and what have you, maybe used for casting-interrupts. Perhaps the conflict between monks and users of magic should be made aparrent in-game, and the tensions between the two fleshed out. <P><BR>I appologize is this turns out to be incoherent- I'm a bit tired and under the weather.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I've played both, and Iksars do make the better monks overall, but Iksar's have to deal with a ton of problems:  The 20% penalty and Faction are the two biggest!  (and anyone that says either is not a problem, has too many people powerleveling him/her and/or can't do the math...)<P>It took me 3 to 4 weeks to get from Scowls in FV to dubious...  I'm still working on faction for High Elves and Gnomes (then I'll be safe to go through Feldwithe without constantly having to look over my shoulder....)  --  If I travel to other parts of the world, I always have to get a camo if it's a druid porting...  And then getting a bind out of guards ranges can be a big problem...<P>If there are any tweaks, it needs to be with the class as a whole...<P><BR>Draggyn Slayyer<BR>32nd Iksar Monk<BR>Cazic-Thule / Children of Tunare<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Their "defining characteristic" was supposed to be unarmed combat, plus a refreshing indifference to loot since they had nothing to buy and couldn't carry it anyway. That all went out the window when items starting being used as kludges to increase the power of monks without really increasing the power of monks. Just go ahead and increase the power of monks directly. If you want it rare, implement some interesting monk quests where they can have their intrinsic AC or dam/delay raised through a quest rather than a item, possibly getting those quest items off the same mobs with the same frequencies as monk item drops now. They could be questhounds rather than gearhounds. <BR>But, alas, it's too late for that now, I guess."&lt;<P>Well, it's never too late to ask.  I like the idea of making monks more reliant on their hands than on weapons, on their skills than on armor.  You're right, it might be too late to make such a dramatic change.  But it warrants at least asking.  There's no reason that a skill can't be just as hard to get as an item, just put the trainer at the end of a tough quest.<P>Pantheon wrote:<P>&gt;"Throwing should get a chance of doing criticals"&lt;<P>Interesting idea.

It might be a nightmare to balance, though.  And it might add too much to the power of the class.

Some want offense, some want defense.  Keep in mind that it is highly unlikely that getting both would be balanced.  When compared to a warrior, a monk will either be more offensive and less defensive, or the other way around.  Being better at both isn't balanced.<P>I'll have to find out what the, um…, Vision ™ is for this class, and then we'll look at both offense and defense.<P>Zadkiel said:<P>&gt;"3a) Encourage usage and training of lesser monk special attacks.<BR>Either allow us to use one type of strike and one type of kick at the same time by unhooking the special attack re-use timers post-50, or give the possibility of attack "strings". (This is the preferred solution, but would be harder to implement.) If a monk successfully uses Flying Kick on an enemy -- connects for damage -- then give a chance (based on Double Attack skill, preferably) for the monk to automatically use Dragon Punch/Tail Rake. If Dragon Punch/Tail Rake connects for damage, give a slightly lesser chance of doing an Eagle Strike. This is not only an interesting solution, it would make raising all of the monk special attack skills more important. This would be a post-50 enchancement, or when a monk reaches 200 skill in Flying Kick."&lt;<P>Also interesting.  Of course, this sounds an awful lot like triple attack… but done in a monkly fashion.<P>&gt;"Allowing us to strike just as hard with the off-hand as the primary will solve the damage-dealing problem and bring us up to the correct damage level of being between warriors and rogues.<P>If this change is made, you will need to remove MNK as a class capable of using the moss-covered twig, a weapon changed to be off-hand only because of the large amount of damage it does when a damage bonus is applied."&lt;<P>Maybe… it also sounds like it has a very high potential chance of bringing that damage output well above rogues…  And having to go back and look over every monk-usable weapon list to make sure one of them isn't broken because of a change like this, well, that puts this idea very low on the list.<P>&gt;"5) Fix the Celestial Fist effect.<BR>Celestial Tranquility is a great effect on our epic, but it stacks with almost NOTHING. Most monks rarely solo post-50, and most common group buffs will keep the effect from working. (Call of Earth, enchanter haste spells, most bard songs, Speed of the Shissar, etc.) At least alter it so that even if the haste is not usable due to other, better buffs then the additional effects -- the extra +AC and +ATK -- will stack anyway, similar to the way the Robe of the Whistling Fists worked. It's pretty bad when a well-meaning ranger tosses me Call of Earth and costs me 54ATK and 12AC. The ranger buff especially does not make sense because Call of Earth is NOT a Haste Buff, and the Celestial Tranquility Effect will indeed stack with the upgrade, Strength of Earth."&lt;<P>That seems to make sense to me.<P>&gt;"7) At least consider spreading the weight limit increase out over the post-50 levels.<BR>Few monks will make 55. Even fewer will make 60. Therefore, weight increases at those two points are not terribly useful. A 2lb increase every other level (i.e., 52, 54, 56, etc) would result in a weight limit of 24 at 60. A 1lb increase every post-50 level would be another way to implement the changes, and would also result in a weight limit of 24 at level 60. If these are "too much" of a weight increase (the current max weight limit at 60 is 22lbs, from four-pound increases at 55 and 60) then skip levels 55 and 60, when we get our passive enhancements of +1 HP per tick while feigned."&lt;<P>This also makes sense to me.<P>&gt;"Skill Caps.<BR>Kick caps at 250. So why does Flying kick, eagle strike, and dragon punch all cap at 230?"&lt;<P>I don't know…<P>&gt;"Also, it was recently announced that they upped the caps for the Hand to Hand skill to equal 1hb/2hb, but all that was raised was the 60 cap, the 50 cap is still only 225 compared with 1hb/2hb cap of 240, so the 50 cap needs to be increased to 240 as well."&lt;<P>Noted.<P>&gt;"In addition, since kunark came out, people have noticed that feign is seen through more and more when the monk is down below 2 bubbles of health. This is a situation where the monk has successfully met the skill check (no "fallen" message), no spell was cast on the monk since they fd'ed, but the mob keeps pounding away. In the monk community this is refered often to as the "frenzy code". When a mob decides that they are going to kill you, they will kill you regardless. I personally have had times where I fd 8 or 9 times successfully in a row, but still have the mob continue to beat on me. Feign at above 2 bubbles of health, and this HARDLY happens. <BR>So, at higher levels fd is useless as an escape tactic."&lt;<P>Thanks, that's a useful explanation of the situation.  I'll use it.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>&gt;"a) revert the hole and sov so that mobs train back instead of walking back at the same time<BR>b) increase the fd skill significatly (post 50 I should not be getting the "fallen" message as much as I do.<BR>c) post 50, spells that hit us after we feign, or at least aoe spells) should NOT break feign. Yes we can take the damage, dot, etc..but it should not break the feign.<BR>d) give us a short reuse disicipline that will clear our aggro 100%. Seem overpowering? not at all, we can already do this, its called /q. remember your downtime thread? having a monk /q to clear aggro is just silly. with /q and the mages coh, there is no reason not to have this."&lt;<P>I'm pretty sure that doing all of these things is just too much.  But I can ask them to look at the situation.<P>&gt;"Bug report: controls locked up upon standing from a fd. <BR>Every once in a while when the monk stand from a feign death, they can only move forwards or backwards. not side to side. The only way to fix this is to fd again (waiting the 10 seconds). <BR>Bug report: Feign death does not work if the monk is in an area where they are forced to crouch.<BR>try feigning from the lava elememental just out side of his area in sola. the ceiling is low enough that the monk has to crouch, and fd will never, ever work there."&lt;<P>Also noted.<P>Nightflash wrote:<P>&gt;"Treant Fists, what can I say. The stats are almost identical to the Gem inlaid gauntlets, but I can do the Gem inlaid gauntlet quest roughly 9 or 10 times, or more with the help of a druid, in the time it takes to do the Treant fist quest. And I can do it much earlier in level. "&lt;<P>Alright, I'll add the Treant Fists to the list.  A sort of 'back by popular demand' kind of thing.<P>Ishahmael said:<P>&gt;"4th Min Dmg on Flying Kick.

A monk could use Flying Kick and a Tiger Claw independently of one another."&lt;<P>Another idea that I can at least mention to the team.<P>&gt;"I don't think this problem could be handled without adding some sort of new skill..perhaps something called 'Tumble' which allows the monk to use acrobatics to back out of the combat...working similar to evade but nowhere near as reliable."&lt;<P>Hmm…  Something that would be super defensive, prevent the monk from doing any damage, and allow him to back out (perhaps dropping them lower on the hate list).  Oddly, that sounds like what feign death was supposed to do…   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Noted.<P>RegorDragonfist wrote:<P>&gt;"The sashes and headbands should have AC and stats comparable to the shackels."&lt;<P>Bears looking into.<P>Keep in mind, though, those of you that are asking for some bonus for being a human monk.  You already have a huge bonus.  You do not pay an experience penalty for your race.  That's even more important now that the burden for that penalty is on the individual character, not that group.<P>Merzak said:<P>&gt;"1) Dodge for Monks should work on creatures hitting us from behind. I think this would be consistent with the idea of a class that is supposed to have a heightened awareness of its surroundings. Given that other classes have high AC that works when being hit from any direction, this ability would help balance monks in relation to other melee classes."&lt;<P>Interesting idea.<P>MoorGhost bravely stated:<P>&gt;"8) Epic quest is too easy. This may not be a popular opinion, but it is true. The Robe of the Lost Circle is obtainable by killing the quest NPC's (please change this). Headbands and sashes can be traded instead of quested for. The Robe of the Whistling Fists can be multi-quested. Once the last robe is obtained, three groups can do all four of the battles needed to get the fists, and none of the mobs are rare spawns. In theory, you only need to camp two components - the pipes for the RotWF - the rest can be purchased or killed for. Our epic weapon should mean more than that."&lt;<P>Thanks for saying that.  I appreciate it.  And, well, it will end up on the list.<P>Thane wrote:<P>&gt;"Why was netted/woven/mesh armor omitted from Froglok drops in Kunark?.

</FONT><HR>Sorry if this has been stated before (don't have the time to read through all the posts in this thread).<P>I think the Monk class is very well done as a whole. I do not see the need nor would want to see additional monk equipment, after all we are suppose to be very lightly equipped damage dealors, not tanks. In terms of fighting (if you use the tank comparison for warriors) I like to view monks more like a well outfitted light infantry vehicle. i.e. We *avoid* damage, not absorb it, and we do not hit like a 20mm cannon, but more like a nest of medium machine guns.<BR>I think the best thing that can be done for monks (and most other melee's) is to re-evaluate how AGI and DEX affect melee combat for a monk. It is well known that if you are a monk and increase AGI and/or DEX it has a minuscule impact on combat. Go read the data I have been to site after site that log analyzers are used to compare the benefits of AGI and DEX vs. STR and AC. Everyone of them has come to the same conclusion. Forget AGI and DEX, AC is a god, and STR is it's son. For a Warrior this *should* be true. A warrior has always been the type that stands in and "takes a licking, but keeps on ticking". A monk on the other hand is the one who hits you ten times, while you try to figure out where the next shot is coming from.<P>If I were to request 1 thing it would be to make DEX and AGI *much* more effective for a monk than any other melee class. I would liek to state that other melee classes should also see some better benefits from DEX/AGI, rangers, rogues immediately come to mind. It just doesn't make sense to me when I had a 200+ DEX and a 200+ AGI, that I would be getting hit about the same amount as a warrior with a DEX and AGI around 110-120.<BR>Just my 2cp.<P>P.S.<BR>There is only 1 discipline that seems to me to be useless.<BR>Relixander has landed a Thunderous kick for (27)!<BR>27!!!! Wow! I can hear the tunder rolling....<BR>Do something with it, at very least give a 1-5 second stun or something. Seriously though, I would say 80-90% of ThunderKicks I have ever seen land for less than the standard Flying Kick.
