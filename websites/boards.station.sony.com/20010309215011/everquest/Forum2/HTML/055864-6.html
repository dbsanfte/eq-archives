</FONT><HR>I'm not going to comment on high level boss encounters as I have no experience of these being only level 38.<P>The points I would like to make are:<P>- If we are meant to be kings of soloing why don't we get self-only port spells?<P>- If we are meant to be kings of soloing why do we get any spells to help out in groups (like mana transfer)?<P>- If we are meant to be useful in groups aswell why do we have so few non-self-only buffs?  It would be really handy to be able to use shadow sight and gather shadows on others?<P>- If I summon a pet it is a skeleton with no mind of its own and controlled by me?  How on earth then can a skeleton be feared using a normal spell?  Necros have a special undead-only fear - so why don't MOBs need to have to have this spell too?<P>- A pet is meant to be a collection of bones brought to 'life' by the power of my mind - why then won't it give me back any weapons I give to it?<P>- If I tell a pet to back off why does it as soon as it gets hit again attack once more?  It should back off until I tell it to attack again.<P>- Why do I lose my pet when I cross a zone boundary?  I'm only walking one step really yet my pet decides to disappear.  Likewise when I log off my pet should remain - for those of us on ordinary modems we get through huge quantities of bone chips.<P>I think these points fall into two main catagories - first problems with our class definition and latterly problems with the pet.  I think the first of these is by far the greater problem - we're in a kind of no-win situation, which I will now explain.<P>Our role is not properly defined from the beginning.  If we were meant to primarily solo we should get hardly any group helping spells.  However if we were meant to group how come the vast majority of our spells are self-only?  I think a formal definition of the class has to be defined (wasn't this 'Master of the Dead'??) and stick by it.  Why not kill our mana transfer abilities and instead concentrate on our damage dealing and death control?<P>Finally, although I haven't got to a level where this is relevant to me there is no way I would sacrifice another character level 46 or higher just so I can cast a slightly more powerful lifetap once.  Why not make essence emeralds have charges and one sacrifice can do say 5 spells which would previously need one?<P>Many thanks and I look forward to seeing what changes await us.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi Absor,<BR>I posted this suggestion to the necromancers on raids thread part 3 or something like that already. It is a suggestion that might help to balance a little the use of the necromancer on an epic mob encounter, but will have minimum to no effect on other encounters and will not introduce the unbalacing effect of unresistable damage.  Before getting to this I'd like to say some things regarding the necromancer's role in general.<P>The necromancer has actually always been a support caster in a group, as well as a damage doer, this is clear because from the beginning necromancers have had the ability to heal a little as one of the core abilities they bring to a group. In patches since release the necromancers grouping abilities have been improved with the addition mana transfer spells, which when combined with the call of bones type of spells can be used to help out a group remarkably if the necromancer just focuses on using his lifetap--bond of death lines of spells to keep himself healthy while generating mana. The ability to debuff in the form of the asystole line was also added, but was really not the most significant group specific enhancement. Thus, to recap, in addition to doing some damage, the main thing a necromancer brings to a raid group is the ability to use his own life to replenish others and to fill the mana of other casters, and then use his own spells to efficiently replenish that life.<P>Now, let's think about lifetaps a little, how they worked in the past, how they work now, and the balance issues involved. Lifetaps and lifetap dots were unresistable in the beginning by any mob. Arguably, this was a bug, however, more likely it was an oversight brought on by the original intentions for the working of these spells. I believe that it is likely lifetaps were irresistable and remain so within the lvl cap except for immune mobs because the game designers wanted necromancers to have a guaranteed way of healing themselves as long as a mob is engaged, after all, can other classes heals be resisted? However, a consequence of this original working of these spells was that they made for unresistable damage, thus they were turned into all or nothing spells that generally function 100% against vulnerable mobs within the lvl cap. This balancing was definitely needed, and lifetaps should never become irresistable forms of damage again, for the simple reason that a group of necromancers casting them together could take on things well beyond what other balanced groups of similar lvl could do. But at the same time, this very reasoning has crippled the necros role as support caster against mobs that resist the lifetaps. Thus, whatever change would be implemented would have to respect both the idea that necros do not get unresistable damage, but at the same time allow them to use their support abilities as intended while engaged to a mob.<P>Therefore, I have a proposal that I believe can respect the two aspects of balancing necros I discussed above, but first an observation. Bond of death line of spells is the most efficient spell to use for the necromancer's group support spells, and is a spell very representative of what the necromancer is about, being over time and a lifetap. Furthermore, I have noticed that if I am in a raid with a higher lvl necromancer there too, that if I cast this spell it will not take hold on the target, but still I will gain it's healing on myself, even though it does no damage to the target in this instance. As an extension of this, I propose that the healing aspect of this spell be made guaranteed provided there is a valid target(NPC, not PC in non-PVP) to cast it on, whether the damage part of the spell is resisted or not. By implementing this idea, the necromancers efficacy against boss mobs is still limited by the fact that the rate of healing he can muster on himself is limited by the speed of the dot, and no form of irresistable damage is added to the game. Moreover, this change will have no affect whatsoever on necromancers outside fo raids, and will not increase their ability to inflict damage in that context, but will allow them to utilize their primary group abilities during the fight, which are still quite balanced with other support casters in this role. Absor, I hope you will read this and consider the suggestion, and pass it on, I believe it is the balanced solution to the problem of necromancers feeling useless in the epic encounters.<P><BR>Lambik the sexy Gnome<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think our pets need to be Immune to Fear and should not be able to be randomly teleported. You are on a Trak raid and your pet gets TP'ed into a pile of 'shrooms or Juggers. They kill him with the greatest of ease and come after his master. <P>One Jugger free to destroy people while fighting Trak and the raid is over.<P>Maybe make is so if the pet is Teleported it dies instantly with no aggro back to his master. If you did this it should include a message. <P>There should also be a high mana cost buff for the pet so he will cause some decent damage. I mean if we arent allowed to DOT, DD or Lifetap atleast let our pets do something so we will actually feel like we contributed to the kill.<P>On the line of Feign Death. Allow use to a spell that will make a component. Make it NO DROP/NO RENT that we can give to another character. That way on a failed attempt a cleric can FD and live to rezz people.<P>Regardless of what you do please make not only a necro desireable on a raid but multiple necros desireable. You take 2 necros on a Trak raid so they can DMF people. You take as many clerics, wizards, enchanters, warriors, melee, druids, shaman as you can.<P>Lifetaps should land on any mob. period. Leave Lich as it is. If it caused more damage to the Necro they would just use C2 which would make another line of our spells useless.<P>Darkness line needs to be looked into. Resists and casting times are an issue.<P>Several people have mentioned discontinued lines of spells that an upgrade would help class balancing. <P>I personally like the idea of a Boon of Garou type buff for the Warriors. Make it an undead creature with similar bonuses. Enchanters hate having to mem that spell anyways.<P>I also like a lifetap damageshield that can be cast on others. The main tank gets hit it taps the MOB for a little amount of HP transfer. Enuff to make a difference but not enuff to be unbalancing.<P>Review the previous thread you started, you will see alot of the same ideas presented by many people there.<P>Necros pay the price for power with bad faction and what not, Uber mobs should love us cause we cant hurt them. I dont know any necromancer that worked his ass off to be a mana battery. We are damage dealers.<P>And to the few Trolls that lurk here, class envy cause you suck at playing yours will get you nowhere. Leave your degrading comments at the door. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I want to further emphasize our concern over Ignite Bones.  I have been repeatedly told by raid leaders not to use this spell because it "decreases a round of melee" which when there are 8+ tanks on a mob equals FAR MORE damage than the spell actually lands for.  This spell IMO is either extremely misunderstood or simply doesn't work in its present form.  Tanks hate it, groups hate it(because it confuses them with the skeleton pet), and raid leaders hate it - and that's about 80% of EQ.<P>It also, because of the skeleton form effect, makes it the only DD spell that doesn't "stack".  In other words, while in skel form, the mob cannot be Ignited Bone again by a lower level necro because the spell doesn't stack.  This hampers this spell in raids with multiple necros.<P>Other than that, I'd like to say that I am totally willing to have the Lich bug fixed if Verant is willing to look at lifetaps and DoTs on big raids.  I was on a Western Wastes raid a week back and it ROCKED being a necro because I could *gasp* land spells on the dragons there! It made the raid MUCH more fun for me than if all I could've done was mana dump.  If more(or all) raids could be made this way, to fix some "bugs" that necros have been taking advantage of is more than a nice tradeoff, at least for me.<P>On the other hand, if all Verant is going to do is let Dots & Lifetaps to land on one more boss monster and then nerf Lich as a tradeoff, I'd be extremely disappointed.  My suggestion is this: Make Lifetaps the equivalent of Lure spells that save on Disease.  This way, we don't infringe on wizards' mastery over Fire/Cold/Magic, AND we can actually land spells.<BR>  <BR>Furthermore, I have concerns regarding the Spectre Pet.  I know that necromancers are suppose to be second-best pet casters, so it's perfectly okay if this pet is totally outclassed by the mage pet(which it is).  However, WHY the peridot? This pet is nothing special in any shape or form compared to the mage pets, yet it costs a peridot to cast.  Why? This should be looked at if the balance of necros as a whole are going to be evaluated.<P>Another concern I have is the stacking of Splurt and Asystole.  If Splurt is casted first, Asystole works, but if Asystole is casted first Splurt does not work.  This affects multiple necros on raids because it is really hard admist the spam and lag to time your Splurt/Asystole so that the other necro can land his spell.  <P>Another concern is the essence emerald which is used in both Infusion AND Trucidation.  Neither spells are worth it and these spells are basically useless.  I have never yet met a necro who used essence emeralds on either spell.  Even if Infusion was targettable, I doubt any necro would use it because, seriously, an UNREZZABLE DEATH is worth far more than 1000 damage or mana.<P>Defoliate, as Absor stated, is basically useless because there's nothing blue which we could affect at the level we are granted this spell.  My biggest concern is it working in the Plane of Growth.  Failing that, at least let it work on myconids in Sebilis because aside from those two monsters there is basically nothing we can use this spell on at the level we get it.<P>Another general concern: Velious mobs are way too magic resistant.  This affects all casters but especially necros / enchanters since these two classes depend largely on magic to be useful.  It is true that necros are granted a large arsenal of spells, but like enchanters, if you take away magic from the list of a monster's able-to-be-affected list, we are basically screwed.  Our only low resistance DoT outside magic is the long acting Heat Blood series and our only two decent DD's make skeletons out of our foes.  We have way too many Magic based DoTs, such as Splurt/Asystole/Darkness/BoD, all of which are magic based thus making them useless in the face of the multitudes of MR monsters in Velious.  The spells we have which are disease/poison based are stolen versions of the shaman equivalent, thus making it hard for us to use the spell if a shaman is present.  It'd be great if one of the above four DoTs(Splurt/Asystole/Darkness/BoD) could be moved to another resistance.<P>Another concern: Quivering Veil.  This spell is suppose to be a life saver, yet it could only be casted at night.  The problem with that is obvious: why would we memorize a life saver that can't be used all the time? Are we only suppose to die at night? I'm thinking this spell should not be a night-only spell, since it is SUPPOSE to be an upgrade to harmshield, the way I see it.<P>That's all I can think of from the top of my head.  Will post later if I come up with anything else IMO wrong with the necro class =P<BR> <P>    </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As a 54 necromancer, I feel that there are several issues that have to be addressed.  These include the effect on Ignite Bones and the mana transfer rates.  However, most of these have been described in detail by previous posters.<P>My primary concern is that you do not change the lich line of spells.  At the current rate of 23hp for 23 mana, I still lose health quite quickly and have to lifetap/bond of death often.  If this rate were increased, it would hamper my soloing ability immeasurably.  It would also require healers to toss more heals at me considering that I cannot cast regen on myself (unless I have an uber rare prenerf fungi staff).  When lich was designed to be 32hp for 23mana, perhaps not enough testing was done or the hitpoints of a necro were underestimated.  But at the present time, lich consumes my life fast enough, a faster rate would decrease the usefulness of the spell drastically<P>I also feel that Arch lich should be moved to 55 rather than having two lich spells at 60.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Trying to set the record strait on this whole life lich/tap/mana transfer discussion:<P>It is becoming increasingly obvious that VI does not have players with necros near 60 playing in large raids.  The appear to be acting on the "myth"/"we programmed it that way" so it should be that way analysis instead of real world experience.<P>1. Demi Lich the lvl 60 fastest convert spell converts 31 hps into mana:<P>	A: Claim it is broke since it does 31 hps damage instead of 48.  If you look at it another way Clarity 2 gives 11 extra mana per tick, so for the bonus 20 mana per tick, we loose 31 hps, so in reality it is not broken.<P>	B: This spell generates 310 mana per minute extra instead of the 110 mana C2 would give.  This is hardly overpowering.  Kunark boss mobs do not last much more than a minute, so it is not like we are churning out mana like crazy.  To use on uber mobs.<P>	C: With the introduction of clarity 2, most mana is maintained with just C2, you rarely see necros liched much in groups.  Lich is only a soloing tactic.  This spell is primarily used in buffing sessions in large parties.<P>2. Life tap series and resists by uber mobs:<P>	A. Life tap is very mana inefficient, Life taps do about 1.77 damage per 1 mana, this is compared to the 2.57 per 1 mana for a wizard.  A wizard lure also casts in half the time.  There is already a severe penalty in place for this line of spells.<P>	B. We cannot use it against uber mobs because of the heal component and we are liched, well as pointed out above in lich items, if we were liched for an epic 2 minute battle we would loose 720 hps, this is less than one tap.<P>	C. Touch of Night (our most efficient damage output, mana ratio, and time spell) takes 8.25 seconds before you can recast, so you can do it 7 times in one minute.  This will also pretty much run you out of mana.<P>3. The discussion of mana transfer efficiency:<P>	A: The transfer vs. heal ability of the cleric (assuming first off that you are dumping into a cleric), for 400 mana a cleric can heal *ALL* your hps, so that argument is wiped out once a clerics is lvl 39 and gets complete heal.  A necromancer with group hero/sym probably average somewhere between 2.2 to 3.5khps depending on equip/stats.<P>	B: It is too overpowering considering healing by cleric... many clerics at upper levels have free heal devices, even if the BP off of trakanon was nerfed to 7.5 minutes, it can be used on the necro since a properly hp item equipped necro can easily stay demiliched 7.5 minutes without needing a heal.<P>	C:  Too overpowering since with lich/tap you can make so much mana. Realistically with out a bard, you can only do a mana dump once a minute, once you have depleted your mana reserve.  If you have a group of 2 bards, one singing the 55 mana song the other one singing the lower level mana song, and you are demiliched, you can dump mana about once every 24 seconds (also a lvl 60 bard with their FA can pretty much keep up with the hp drain of demilich without even having to twist).<P>	D: This spell is usually used in only used in a few situations like mass reses/bufs sessions, is it really that bad to help out the recovery of a large raid. Or, in case of emergencies like when the enchanters/clerics are low on mana.<P>-------<BR>It would be nice if VI talked to necros who group a lot and raid a lot at 60 before making all these statements about high level play (it would even be better if they had some lvl 60 necros that actually raided by the the dev team)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Statement of problem:<P>Everquest is a game based in grouping and social contact.<P>Necromancers are a soloing class.<P>Conclusion:<P>Necromancers need to be modified in order to fit into Everquest.<P>Detail:<P>Necromancers are able to solo because of having three things, a pet, fear, and snare.<BR>These give a necro the choice to solo to 50, if he/she so chooses.  The problem comes about when a necromancer wants/needs groups.  If the reason a necromancer cannot find a group is he/she soloed too long and now lacks the skills to be accepted into a group, or just do not have the contacts to find a group, once again because of soloing, then they should have to deal with their choice.<P>However, groups do not choose necromancers to join their groups, in many cases forcing the person to solo regardless of the necromancer’s preference.  <P>DoTs don’t damage fast enough to be effective in a group, or will get the necromancer killed, which will slow the group.  Necromancers do not nuke well (or at all).  Necromancers can transfer mana, but not as quickly as a mage can with mod rods.  Necromancers have pets, but they are of limited use indoors and are out matched by mage pets.  Necromancers can snare and fear, but snare is by no means unique and fear again is of limited use in most situations involving a group.  Necros also have a mez spell, but I have not seen people hunt post 50 with out an enchanter.  What is the thing that makes necros unique so that they will get one of the highly prized spots in a group of 6?  That is the problem with necros in groups.  Other classes do every thing we do better in groups.<P>The argument about soloing does not hold valid either.  Druids and wizards can quad kite, but are still able to find groups because of their abilities.  Monks can solo post 50, to a point, and are able to limit down time with bandages and mend.   Good enchanters can solo with their mind-bending spells.  I’ve seen many bards soloing with their charming.  With the changes made to the necromancer class, I do not think we are the best soloing class now (this is up to personal opinion and I’m sure people on both sides could have very good arguments to support their view). <P>Necromancers are lacking a nitch of their own in groups.   Verant seems to be VERY against giving necromancers anything new, for fear of necros using it to solo better.  I agree that our soloing ability is as high, if not higher, then it should be, but look and see that we are not alone in this any longer.  We used to be the most over powered class in the game that is true, but is it fair that we have to pay for past power when the classes are so much closer to balance?  Necromancers are now under-used for groups.  We are just not needed in groups. And if you don’t want us to solo, then what are we left with?<P>Please put some time into these concerns.  Address them instead of dismissing them.  Verant seems to be against anything that might encourage any more necromancers.  (I can show you how dumb our epic looks as proof).  What about the necromancers who have invested a lot of time trying to group and make friends there?  We are getting left behind by our friends because they can get spots, and we cannot.<P>Maybe let us give mana faster (same ratio), but we need to be the best at something.  Right now we do a bit of it all, but at high levels, that does not cut it.  If there were more bards on my server, I doubt I would get any groups compaired to their unlimited mana song.  We just cannot group well enough yet with the tools that have been given to us to warrent a spot in a group (given a choice between other classes).<P>Thanous Soulbleeder<BR>55th Erudite Necromancer<BR>Brell Serilis<P>Note:  The comment about the necro epic item may be off topic, but I for one feel insulted when I compare it to other epic items.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
