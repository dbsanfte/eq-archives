</FONT><HR>1. change the "/pet report health" command, or even add a "/pet say health" command to make the pet audibly report its health so others around can hear it.  <P>2. Call of the Hero has become a VERY class-defining spell for the high level magician. As such I believe it should be buyable and not a rar drop. Many magicians are invited on certain raids solely for this spell, while magicians without it are excluded.<P>3. There are so many places that pets get lost in bad pathing that I can't possibly keep track of them. If I were to pick one place in particular it is the plane of hate: it is one of the worst zones for pet pathing. As such most magicians are not allowed to use pets there.<P>4. The 52 fire pet is only good for some PvP combat. I would suggest re-tuning it to be useful in more PvE scenarios.<P>5. The summoned levitation rings do not always correctly report the number of charges left. They frequently report 1 charge left when in fact there are none.<P>6. Give the research skill some continued usefulness past level 49. Perhaps some of the rare dropped spells could have some very difficult recipies that can be followed. Or...perhaps after research of 200 you gain the ability to research other class spells....this would make the skill even more of a trade skill. (this applies to all classes).<P>7. Mod rods are handy in some situations but their usefulness diminishes substantially in the post 55 game. I would suggest adding an improved mod rod summon around level 55....with less mana cost and better health-mana conversion ratio. This is important to give magicians some much-needed additional group utility at a time when their solo ability dries up.<P>8. Is there some balance reason group-buffs/songs do not affect pets? Or is it just because its hard to do? In any case, if this could be reviewed and changed it would remove one headache for magicians and their group-members alike. For example, group-magic resist is cast, magician has to then ask to have the single target variety cast on the pet as well.<P>9. Necro pets turn into a pile of bones when told to "\pet sit down" while magician pets have no visible change. How about when they sit down, make magician elementals resemble a clumped-up ball like when npc elementals die.<P>10. Ok I'm getting overly picky here but while we are at it....skellie pets giggle when they cast a spell. Give elementals some sort of extra sound effect too.<P>11. This was a long time ago....but I remember crushbone having bad pet pathing. Summon a pet at the zone line, hug and follow the right wall, and see how long the pet follows you.<P>Just a few of my thoughts.<P>Phypher Phantomblade<BR>57th Conjurer of Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>you say we are well balanced with our pets and i'd agree with that. my only real problem lies in situations where i can't use my pet and there are far too many of them. <P>this getting a list of pathing problems from us is futile. there are waay too many places for you to fix. some of these have been around for many years now and i don't expect a fix to them all. <P>here's an idea and maybe there's a reason this isn't feasible, but could you put our pets on beta neutral faction so they do not get attacked? we cannot travel invis with them, so it's not like we can travel with a pet up by mobs that are KOS to us. this, combined with the summon pet spell would fix most of our problems. pet wanders off, bring him back. as it is the summon pet spell won't do squat for me in sebillis, my pet wanders 20 feet and it's game over for me most anywhere in there. <P>also in large raids isn't it true that only 4 pets can attack a mob at once? so if you're the fifth mage (or more) are you not just the raids crappiest wizard?<P>a mage with his pet is quite balanced *true i agree*, a mage who is unable to use his pet isn't much help to a group</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My point regarding balance is simple. <P>  - Magicians direct damage spells are too powerful. They are only a small percentage less powerful than a wizards. This should not be the case.<P>Example: <BR>Level 34 <BR>Ice Shock = 306 - 320 dd<BR>Blaze = 276 dd<P>Level 44 <BR>Force Strike = 545 - 625<BR>Shock of Swords = 580 - 600<P>In each of these the difference is a mear 30 points of damage. The pet does WAY more than 30 points of damage.<P>The power of a mage's direct damage spell is a balancing issue.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I would like to see a summon decoy spell for mages. Works very similar to Feigh Deah (eventhough you get the spell off its not guaranteed to work). You summon a nekkid dark elf (if your mage is dark elf) and the mob can be tricked into thinking that it is you. The HP of the summoned creature can be inline with the Rune series. For example Rune I will absorb 60HP (if i recall correctly) so decoy 1 will asbrob 60hp then mobs comes after you. Would be kind cool IMO plus it would be in perfect form of the mage class. It would solve the mage "no escape after pet dead" issue. Maybe make it cost 1 malachite and 1 cats eye agate. Mages in D&D get something like this I understand. <P>Also Absor can we please get charges per lvl on mod rods? Like you summon a mod rod with 2 charges at 50, 3 at 1 etc... Or please make them not lore. <P>Last suggestion please let mages summon a item that you can right click to stun your target (no dmg or minimal dmg 9dmg tops). </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Major balancing issue:<P>Pre 50...we rock.  Post 50...we lost major power.<P>We need to be moved up the latter for damage output...plain and simple.  Our class is ALL about damage and we just do not do enough.  The pet needs to be compared to a warrior/rogue/monk of the same level with that level's equipment.  <P>My second issue is the pets are PC's rather then NPC's.  This means that pets should be effected by Group spells and bard songs.<BR>Lets look at our first group DS as an EXAMPLE(READ example as this applies to all group spells).  You can cast three 49th shields for the cost of one group DS.  SHOW me a group that has three tanks in it...ok, maybe 5 percent of the group do.  MOST groups have two melee'rs in the bunch.  HOW on gods green earth is the group DS supposed to benifit us?  Allow pets to recieve the benifits.  Same with with other spells as this will aid all of my other posts too.<P>My third gripe is that pets need higher resists.  Remember they are PC's now and should be able to resists spells like a PC.  Right now my pet can not resist a root,snare,gflux,fear,&lt;insert ANY spell&gt; to save it's life.  <P>My last point...PET CONTROL!  I have VERY good pet control but it simply is not good enough.  The ONLY pet that really excells at pet control is AIR because it allows us to back the pet off when needed.  The big reason that was listed that mages do not have a /pet NOATTACK or /pet IGNORE is that a smart pet would eliminate tanks and such.  Well, since they all outdamage us anyways, remember I am talking post 50 here, why not give us this ability?  There is no reason a pet should just go to town on a mob because it looked at me wrong.<P>You talk about balance.  Balance is when a class that is designed to do something is on par with other classes that have the same mold.  Mages are MOSTLY about damage output as are several other classes.  Why aren't we dealing the same damage or close to it as the other classes?  I put rogue and monks in the same category...high offensive power for little defensive power.  We are not really a support class with the exception to mod rods(which need more charges or need a mod rod2 spell for say 600 mana for 800hp) and CoTH.<P>The end game is about raids and well, we are worthless because our pets are not allowed and we do no damage to mobs.  Please address these if at all possible.  I really did not see some of my issues(ok, maybe rewording) in other posts.  I accept the fact that I am an offensive class.  I do not want roots or clarities.  THAT is the tradeoff I made when I chose a mage.  Well, you have dilitued this now to be blunt.<P>Anyother addition I would make to the class has been covered in previous post.  You asked us in your second post to come up with new things...well there you go  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>-slimer 56.5 mage of lanys</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>well here's my 2cp.  first if you're fixing pathing i'd suggest you fix the planes first.  i was really ticked when on my first hate raid i was told no pets becuase the pathing is bad and they get lost.  it really sucks to be a pet caster who has mainly all offensive spells and lose out on 1/3 to 1/2 or more of your damage output cause you can't use your pet.  other than that i'd like to see some procing summoned weapons and voice graft just for fun so i can have my SG pet in Oasis talking to the newbies at the docks  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Good Post Absor and you pretty much covered all of the big problems. However i have some other suggestions for solving some of problems.<P>Pet AOE fear Problem:<BR>Deffinatly an issue and the level 59 immunity to fear spell will help. However this leaves about 8 other magician levels (50-58) where a magician could encounter a AOE fear mob. How about an incrimental solution. Leave full immunity at 59 but add a level 49 decent casting time remove fear pet only spell. This would essentially still make the level 59 spell superior and still let low 50's mages participate. Maybe combine it with a message that tells us when our pets are feared.<BR>Another lower level solution could be a pet immobilize spell. That completely frezzes the pet but lets the fear subside as normal. It would keep the pet from fleeing and aggroing other mobs but would still be essentially removed from combat for  the duration of the immobilize (and the fear for that matter).<P>The only other issue that hasn't really been covered (on your list). Was general spells drops and the uselessness of research beyond 50. Please relook at the whole idea behind making post 50 spells rare drops. And if the pressumption is that not all casters will have ALL of thier spells then please balance mobs based on that pressumption. Personally I like the idea of moving some of these rare drops back to the research only realm (collect common components for research of some of the now rare spells). I was a little dissappointed when you floped from making spells research rare to mobs drop rare. The later only encourages farming and camping while the former does not. The reason this is applicable in a class balance discussion is that a lot of the other classes that have to find thier rare drop spells have some usefull platnium gathering skills (ie clerics rez for cash, druid/wizzies port for cash, enchanters enchant for cash, Shamens use alchemy for cash, etc). None of our summons has really been powerful enough to warrent charging for. The use of those skills by other classes has somewhat lessened the impact of having find/purchase thier post 50 spells (admitingly not to a very large degree).<P>Thanks for listening (but in general I agree we are a usefull a fairly balanced class).<P>Ves</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Magician's last line of defense:  Mages don't get spells like root and snare, nor do I think they should.  It would be nice to have some option for emergencies when we get attacked.<P>If a magician is attacked without a pet, he must either rely on his group to get it off him, or he can stand toe to toe and gate(5 seconds I think?)/nuke(5+ seconds).<P>Should VI determine that magicians could use some sort of emergency spell, my suggestion would be this:  <P>A fast casting, high mana cost, short duration personal damage shield with a power similar to the fire elemental aura.  <P>The main thing I find frustrating about being a magician is that I usually die with 75% of my mana or more.  I think it would be nice to be able to toss up a 40 point damage shield with some of that mana so that as the mob pounds me to smithereens I have some chance of not dying.  The spell would not be helpful in average fighting if there was a very high mana cost and recast time.<P>Damage shields are a staple of the mage class and I don't think a spell like this would be out of character.<P>Clerics are a specialist class much like magicians, and sacrifice much to be the best healers at what they do.  Clerics get Divine Aura, a spell that is not particularly useful in day to day combat, but it is an option they can take if they want to.<P>Wizards are also a specialist class.  They have shadowstep.  Another spell of limited use, but is helpful and has a fast cast time.<P>Necromancers are a pet class like magicians, and can feign death.  FD is aruably much more useful than a long recast, high mana cost, personal uber damage shield.<P><BR>By the way Absor, I think you covered everything else I would have mentioned in your recap.  <P>The resist rates on rains are really high though.  I don't agree with Grimstaff that the rains need to be changed to hit 4+mobs with 3 waves 3 each.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'll try not to rehash what everyone else has already said.  The mage is a fair class pre-50, and yes they can solo under specific conditions.  The place they are most lacking are in the utility spell area as well as non-pet related combat (escape)<P>1.  Utility spells:  I think most of the summon spells should be lower levels than they are now.  Why not allow us to summon a decent (no-rent) weapon when it might actually be used?  In addition, being able to summon various items that could be used as buffs would go a long ways towards making the mage feel useful.  Summon waterstone is a good example.  Why not an entire line of summon elemental stones that give damage shields, elemental protections or even minor haste or other uses.  Making them expendable and/or lore gives them a fair limitation.  There have been dozens of threads concerning new summons.<P>2.  Escape/non-pet combat:  Okay, I suppose I should summon a pet every time I zone, but please there are times no pet is going to help, or thanks to pathing, will actually cause trouble.  If I zone in and suddenly find a clops, giant or other similiar mob on me, I die, unless I have Jboots and or can gate.  Now, as far as this situation goes, I do not see any sort of easy solution.  The best idea I have heard (not my own) was a special low level pet spell that summons a pet with incredable taunt but does little to no damage.  It will tie up a mob long enough for a gate (hopefully) or at least a head start run to the zone.  This would be a non-reagent spell usable on corpse runs and during travel.<P>Now my own suggestion:  (I know it will be shot down) Level 55-Call of the Nemesis:  This summons a targeted mob to the caster.  It would have the same taunt factor as a broken mez (or even higher) but would give the mage that ultimate summoning.  Yes it could be abused, but make some mobs unsummonable, and the taunt would be quite the deterent, but this has a major WOW factor.<P>All in all the mage is a fair class, but with some minor adjustments could be a GREAT class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Okay, for the people who claim that mages have no defense without a pet against green mobs:<P>You are completely wrong.<P>My entire career as a mage, whenever I've been jumped by a green mob and I had no pet, you know what I did?  Stood there and slugged it out.  Yes, I nuke the mobs to death.  At higher levels especially, Channelling is high enough that I recover from interruption with regularity, and can kill any green toe-to-toe just by nuking it to death.  Mages DO NOT NEED a root or snare spell.<P>If you're incapable of doing this (and there's no reason why you should be), then you're simply doing something wrong.  I've gated right in the middle of getting pummeled by a Bloodthirsty Ghoul.  Successfully.  Same for many other mobs.<P>Now I know that at higher levels (52+) green mobs can be high enough to actually be a significant threat.  The solution?  GET A PET OUT BEFORE RUNNING AROUND A DANGEROUS ZONE.  You have your defense right there!  Why aren't you using it?<P>- Teramenor (49 mage, never been killed by a green, except once at 35)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Thanks for these class threads, it is nice to be able to post in this environment.  Anyway, I am pretty happy with the Mage class right now.  (That could be b/c I just got my Inny staff  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> )  Although I do have a couple suggestions that I think are pretty easy.<P>First, I would LOVE to see some text to go along with our summon pet spells.  Very simple I think, just something like shammies/necros get like when they "rise from the dead" or "summon a companion spirit."  I think ours could be pretty cool, maybe a different one for each element like "Mage00 weaves the surrounding air into a powerful ally." or "Mage00 calls upon the power of the earth and summons a mighty ally."  Or at least one for all the elements like "Mage00 calls upon the power of the elements and forms a powerful ally to do his bidding."  Just, IMHO, a cool idea that would be easy to do and would increase the aura of us being a powerful pet class.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Second, for sure, please look at the Vocerate Fire spell.  Maybe it is just me but this pet not only seems to be WAY underpowered but I think it is buggy.  Multiple times I have had my pet eat itself whenever the steelskin(I think that's it) spell it casts on itself wears off...very strange.  Can you also answer why the damage shield it casts on itself is O'keils Radiation and not the normal fire pet dmg shield?  (lvl +2 I think)<P>Third, a simple quick question:  is there any way we could get a spell for mana regen for ourselves?  Mod Rod gives 150 mana and costs 200 to summon, so useless for us, good for others.  We are the only int casters who don't get a mana regen spell like harvest or leech, etc.  Probably won't happen, but what's the harm in asking?   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Fourth, I disagree with the idea that we are underpowered, I put out plenty of damage.  (even thought those silly necros get a backstabbing pet at 53 and we don't get ours until 54, and even that is hypothectical...hehe  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> )  It would, however, be nice to be able to use my Vocerate Fire pet (great idea, I would LOVE to use it) without my group threatening to bind me deep in seb.<P>You all are doing a great job, thanks for the hard work.<P>Spikee D'Sxee<BR>53rd Mage &lt;Wraithguard&gt;<BR>Tallon Zek<P>PS - here here for a cool looking pet to match the necro's spectre pet!

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>OK While I agree with your list in general there are some MAJOR points being totally overlooked, specifically with the "ROLE" of the magician.. but first heres a few comments on your list:<BR>1)No Rent Items:  The most viable solution ....<BR>Sorry Absor your beating a dead horse unless we've all been mislead. Your probably not aware of how the databases are set up but in a nutshell I've leard after several emails to Abashi a while back that the FORMAT of the database does not allow the inclusion of any sort of time stamp to indicate when a character was logged out/timed out..  in order to ADD this they'd need to recompile the entier character database which we were told would result in a player wipe across all servers..   I am a programmer myself and can suggest several ways around this problem, however without knowing the makeup and format of the database structure any further speculation is wasted on deaf ears.<P>Rain Spells: Nice that I see test server already is working on this.<BR>Pathing: Get specific zone examples where pathing is at its worst. Old Sebilis, Trakanon's lair specifically..<P>Though somewhat related to pathing some of our pets are TOO BIG for dungeons.. Kesora and Sol A both have major pathing problems due to the fact the pet cannot fit thru the doors at higher levels and with the epic.. Sure you can argue that a magician of those levels shouldn't be there but since the monsters STILL attakc me at level 59 without a pet they WILL kill me in seconds. SOme sort of SHRINK pet spell or even modifiying the models a bit so they can fit thru the doors.<P>Pets and AoE fear: Great fix if it gets implemnted.. there is an unspoken standing order on any creature that can cast fear (almost all gods and dragons, that mages are NOT to use pets)<P>Voceration: Fire and Greater Voceration: Hah since your own game will not tell us the SPELL damage it's very hard to tell what the damage out put is like on these pets, sure there melee skills are LOUSY and i've a feeling thier nukes are resisted as if it were a player of that level casting it (ie 46th caster at level 58 summons)  try that against a dragon or other level 60 creature that it's typically fighting and see what resistances it gets.<P><BR>Spell Drops:<BR>Aegis of Ro- Dropping but still extremely rare off only level 60 dragon encounters to date.. other 60 spells drop off slightly lower and more frequently spawning creatures, one of which is on a 30 min timer i know of rather than the weeklong dragon  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><BR>54th Water Pet- Rare drop only time I've seen it is off of the Protector in Seblis, a level 60ish creature. It does NOT drop off mobs in skyfire to my knowledge, however tat is where the appropriate level mobs are located, along with seblis and howling stones.<BR>Pet Graphics: How about a new graphic!! Yes! But if you do this, make sure you have a UNIQUE graphic for the Epic weapon (specifically one which embodies all the elements in one graphic, something akin to the Male Efretti graphics, strong, floating and somewhat 'flaming' looking)<P>Rage of Zomm: It's HP need to be increased a bit, one repost, area of effect spell or even ANY hit from big mobs will kill it , making it useless.<P><BR>DoTs: I posted this before but you made a statement for necromacers that DoTs by defination are the best mana/damage which is what makes them useful.. this is NOT the case with magiicans, our dots are no more useful than equivalent blasts from a DD spell and are much longer to cast, don't stack and contrary to popular belief, have no appreciable effect on the 'taunt' list of a magician thats noticable.<P>Dyzil's Deafening Decoy:-- Great idea on the 2sec casting. As it stands it's a useless spell<P>Higher level pet healing spell: Duh.. how'd that get missed in the first place.. but if so, a retooling of mana cost is in order, even of the lower ones the mana/heal is kinda out of whack imo.<P>Improved Invisibility: Why don’t magicians get this spell? Answer- Verant hates us  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> heh<P>Phantom Armor: It would be nice to make the component a single item that costs 4 (or even more) times as much. BEEN ASKING THIS SINCE I RELEASE!!<P>Robe of Conjuration: Also need to take into accont the casting time/duration, summon corpse is a 'downtime' spell meaning casting time isn't as important.. during fights which is when this spell is often used due to its extremly SHORT duration, the spellcasting makes it almost worthless to have. <P>-----<BR>Ok some NEW things you didn't mention:<BR>1) As a magician all of our 'commands' for pets are hotkeyed to socials, yet when we use any item, our robe, leggs, or other 'charged' item with a casting time we cannot control our pets via socials.  Suggestion would be to place "PET COMMAND" keys simular to spell icons so that we can use those during 'click' items, most of ours have cast times near the 10 second mark (Robe, Epic, Burnt staff, legs, etc..)<P>2) Bolt Spells.. while the idea is great many of them really have no benefit as they stand.. A DD spell will do most damage on average simply due to the fact that line-of-site isn't as particular as a bolt.  In a 9 second casting time of a bolt spell you need a CLEAR shot.. any stupid ogre that stands in front of the gnome casting just cost him valuable mana.  OK i can live with that if the benefit was good, but why bolt when i can DD for the same mana/damage rate in the same resistance category?  The only GOOD bolt is Scars of Sigil, while it's mana/damage rate isn't that much better, it does have the fastest casting time making it ideal for close combat situations. Fix the mana/damage/casting time/line of sight on bolt spells and they'd be a bit useful.<P>3) Pets- Thier taunt is a joke.. I don't know what formula it uses, but even my EPIC pet cannot taunt off ANY tank class at all, even if they tank is not using taunt and using 2hand weapons! What's the point of this feature of a pet if it does no good? I seem to have the impression it taunts as a NPC/player of it's level, thus at best it's level 49 with the Orb of Mastery.. Perhaps the entire taunt formula could use a revamp?<P>4) Shard of the Core- NO DROP??? Why bother making it, coldstone and a decent poison resist range item are better by FAR. In fact I see more 'teachers syllabus' items for sale than I do the shard of the core spell.  I've cast this once to verify it was no drop.. since then it's on the last page of my book along with pouch of quillos, quiver of marr and quite a bit of other useless summons.<P>5) ok my BIGGEST CONCERN!  What is the ROLE of magicians?  There are two theories, one is that we are our pets for all intents and purposes, and because of that our spell line in other areas is 'lacking' in power and usefulness.  IF that's true what's with the Necromacer (the only other TRUE pet class), something is not right balace wise between the two pet classes.  The second theory and my personal pet pieve, is that we are also 'summoners' in that we have the ability to create objects from thin air and provide them to our group members saving them the cost of buying them and in many cases providing superior if not limited items.  The problem is, most of our summonings are no longer needed because you GAVE THEM TO OTHER CLASSES.. what happend to not providing key ablitys to other classes??  Lets look at a few glaring examples..<BR> I don't have the time to look up every one, but I'd say that there are WAY to many classes that now have a way to make summoned food, water, and bandages without mana.<BR> Rangers who were the only ones to really ever ask for arrows, are now able to make thier own..<BR> Monks, given our BEST summons 'pouch of quillos' why were we even given this rogue/monk only item if you were going to give it to the monks to begin with?<P>I guess my problem is you keep talking about how class X cannot have skill Y because it'd reduce the power/desirability of the class where skill Y originated from.. yet we as magicians keep seeing our power dwindling down to nothing.<P>To this day, a mage is only requested for groups if the following conditions are met:<BR>1) Do you possess Call of the Hero<BR>2) Are you level 60 and with Mala (Malo is shaman :P )<BR>3) Will you promise NOT to use a pet! (most mages cannot control them either due to skill or game mechanics, lag etc.. so more often than not mages are told NOT to use them)<P>Other than those 3 things mages are rarely asked to group anywhere because they bring nothing NEW to a group that another class cannot do equially if not better.<P>At lower levels (pre 45ish) a mage is nice for the extra tanking ablity of the pet, but once you pass into the upper levels MOST of your time is not sitting in a quiet spot pulling monsters to you, you are moving thru dungeons, prepareing for the 'big boss' or otherwise having multiple groups on a single creature, in all thsoe cases a mage has very little to offer that cannot be fufiled better by any other character.<P>Meraxes Glibilskym<BR>59th Master of Elements, Fennin Ro<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>DoT's:  I think the fact that those spells do damage over time is because they push the target back a lot more than the shock spells.  These spells were obvously not intended to be damage/mana efficient.  I may be wrong but I think that this will make inturrupting spells a little easier.  The only problem I see is the very long cast time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>On the Epic Quest, to dispell any rumors that the quest is more than an exorcize in random chance, look at this:<P>I did the math on how long a given magician will have to wait for a staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth, and (assuming you get to kill Inny every other time he spawns, and you are one of 5 mages rolling on it) You will be waiting an average of 700 days.  Yes, thats right, 700 days.  Thats just under two years of play dedicated to ONE item.<P>and the pegasus cloak is cruel too, though Quillmane is more frequent now at least....<P>On Phantom Armor:<P>Change names to Conjured Leather, Conjured Chain, Conjured Plate, and Conjured Armor, change the messages from "Solefarin dons illusionary chainmail" to "Solefarin dons conjured chainmail", or simply "Solefarin conjures chainmail around his body"<P>Also, as you mentioned in the 'chanter thread, but forgot in the summary above, perhaps add a leather/chain/plate/? illusion to the spells.  Make it kinda like when you first equip a ranged weapon, in that it overwrites your current graphics, but you could then take your robe off and put it back on and then you would look normal.<P>On Elemental illusions: YES<BR>It just plain makes sense.  Not even 'chanters can argue against it.  On the same basis you, necros, and some 'chanters feel about undead illusions (should be necro only), you could make the same argument about elemental illusions for us (though we never got them in the first place, so no one has mentioned this yet.)<P>On pet names:<P>make a command usable by anyone that returns the target pets name, like /leader or somesuch.<P>I would HATE seeing a billion "Solefarin's Pet"'s a day, even though 5 or 6 Jobabers is annoying too.<P>Allow us to submit a name for each pet we create, that, if it passes a non-offensive test, becomes the name of THAT TYPE of pet for one week before it can be changed again (like the chat handle)<P>i.e. I would love to have my fire pet be Sparky, and my air pet Fluffy, and my earth pet Spike, etc.<P>just my 3cp (so its worth more than everyone elses, even if only by 1cp.)<P>-Sol</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Could someone please explain something? I am a Level 31 Mage (have a 41 Bard too) and I am interested in the whole Pet fear thing. How is a pet being feared and running to get mobs any different than a player getting feared and pulling mobs back? I don't see the difference.<P>As for my input to this thread, Rain spells need to be resisted less, have 3 waves (that don't hit the pet), and be an AE. Currently, there are 3 waves, BUT, if you have 4 mobs that are in the AE effect you only get 1 wave that hits each mob. If it's an AE then each mob should be hit 3 times.<P>How about an upgrade to the Column of Fire AE spell? What a great spell that was!<P>Summoned items that are actually usefull.<P>Too many Evocation spells, we are conjurers.<P>Pet Health Bar?
