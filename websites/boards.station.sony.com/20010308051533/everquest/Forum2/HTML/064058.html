&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Please, read this post in its entirety before responding.<P>I am still on vacation, as i am in Oregon with the In-laws untill Mondayish.<P>I wanted to share my thoughts on what i have learned from not being able to play Everquest for a little over 2 weeks.<P>1.) Everquest sounds like a fun game, in theory.<P>2.) I am a little sad about all the time i spent playing Everquest and not spending time with my family, as I have found that spending time with my family has been exceedingly more interesting and "wierd".<P>3.) Justification of my time spent playing, is difficult, as i have spent a long time playing Everquest just to get nowhere in game.<P><BR>As i sit here contemplating my return to "real life" as it were. I face the inevitable reality that again, i will be working the late shift, and have little time to spend other than online, and that i will probably end up playing Everquest to ease my late-night boredom again on my return.<P>However, I am not really sure i will. As i come back to the message boards, i find myself faced with the cold hard reality, knowing that Aradune wants to take his game in a direction completely away from what my initial expectations and hopes were in a three-dimensional orientated fantasy role playing game.<P>Im sure, from my reading of other posts on this board over the past few weeks, that i am not alone in my dissapointment.<P>What is odd, is that i cant really finger out any particular reason for the sour-taste i experiance in my mouth when i even think about spending hours a night again on Everquest.<P>If im forced to think about it though (and im forcing myself to do so) i would have to say that it seems to me, at least that Aradune is trying his absolute hardest to ensure that is takes us longer and longer, and longer to "enjoy" this game.<P>In fact, it is now taking so long, that I am now associating EQ with being nothing more than a Graphical chatroom than anything else.<P>As i remember, i spent a lot of time talking to others in /ooc /shout or /gu than anything else in the game. I remember very brief bouts of "fighting" the enemies, and very long bouts of waiting around for my mana to fill, or my health bar to fill.<P>It is kinda sad that i remember playing the game about a tenth of the time i spent doing other things while playing the game.<P>If i wasnt playing i was: reading a book, watching MTv Discovery or SciFi, getting a drink, taking a pee, getting something to munch on (usually leftovers), ordering pizza, calling Cox to yell at them out some more for thier crappy service, playing with the cat, tormenting the cat, throwing the cat at the wall for sinking its hyperdermic-back legs into me, or sleeping lightly so i could wake up every now and then to check my life/health bars.<P>Maybe now that i have a Playstation2 (heh best thing to come out of going to a small bodunk town for vacation), i can play some Armored Core2, DoA2, or maybe some FFIX... Hey, i can even watch a few of the movies i have while playing Everquest...<P>Now that i think about it, Everquest is the only game that instead of using the CPU to multitask, it uses the USER to multitask during its operation.<P>Oh well, im done.<P>May the usual mix of VaK trolls enter and defend thier "holy grail" of games to the death, as they allways do to posts such as these.<P>A disenchanted EQ fanatic - - - ... out.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>VAX never disappoint, do they?<P>Heh, before I started this game I decided I HAD to have a manastone.  The drop was nerfed 4 days after I started playing.  I didn't feel like paying $400 for a manastone on eBay, so I never got one.<P>Then I figured on J-Boots, but they had been changed to the sadistic current quest.  The best chance I have now to get them is to spend 12+ hours online, hoping for a shot at the camps, or to KS someone.  Or pay to multiquest them.<P>And so on, and so forth...<P>Why do you keep offering these things to us, only to jerk them away like Lucy and that friggin' football.  How many times do we have to land on our ass again 'till you are satisfied?<P>Well, I'm sick of chasing your virtual carrots.

</FONT><HR>Let me make this a little clearer for those of you tempted to start a "GQLLFM" tirade.<P>This is about my insight on how EQ has become increasingly "less fun" through the introduction of repeated "nerfs" to the game designed to drag out the core process of levelling even more with each "nerf".<P>This is about how i, and others have become aware of these actions by the company responsible to this game.<P>This is about how through the repeated use of<BR>"negativity nerfs", the enjoyment of this game by<BR>some of the people playing this game is being slowly reduced to nothing.<P>This is NOT a thread designed as a gateway for the GQLLMF crowd to distribute thier unwanted VaK propaganda and display thier undying love for Verant.<P>This is not a thread for flames.<P>Keep it flame-free.<P>Thanks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>While it appears I spend more time reading the boards than actually playing the game, I agree with the original poster on many regards.  The fun factor for the game has eroded, but that is my version of fun.  Others will, of course, disagree and state such phrases as that GQLLFM since I will believe my lifestyle is much different than their lifestyle.  Whereas I can not picture myself sitting _months_ in front of the monitor involved with one game, others are much less frugal and possibly see themselves as spending wanton time in situations they enjoy.<P>So while I will not dictate how others should lead their lives, on the same terms, another should not dictate my life.  If the designers want to push a fun factor of idling around with brief moments of excitement, then that is their choice.  I prefer to have a slower, but steady, fun factor.  I enjoy the freedom of doing a bunch of little things simultaneously like multi-tasking instead of being limited to only _one_ option on some feeble attempt to reduce outside influences to the designers' game.  Whereas I enjoy the body language / facial expression / voice of interaction, it appears games of this caliber are releases for the socially inept.<P>To dedicate so much of one's life to one game is bordering on fanatical to me.  Yet the same people who do in fact revolve their lives around a game that in the end have nothing to show for their efforts will see it otherwise.  These people will lash out against those pointing out another angle to life because it goes totally against their current life - the game.  Without this game, these people are nothing and they know it.  Whereas they state they can leave at any time without quarm but only play for fun for x hours a day, x hours a week are the same people I would believe would have trouble describing anything other than the game, much less interact in social gatherings.  They think only in terms of the game, so such phrases as GQLLFM are their crutch against the reality of the world.<P>On a tangent similar, yet slightly different, I never see any decent replies from the same hardcore diehards whenever another states that their involvement in the game allows casual players more options with those of the opposite sex in real life.  Almost as if the whole is foreign to them.<P>As I said, this is but my opinion.  If the designers want to prolong the game, that is their option.  My option is to enjoy the change, or enjoy other aspects of life.<P>The choice is obvious to me.<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Axlrose - ...&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Just before I quit I finally got some good armor and wizdom items from a guildmate. By the way she was 45 and at the time I was 32 and she asked me how I got so far with such crappy stuff. I told her that I just pick my fights carefully and I try to make sure I control the situation and not the npc.<P> <BR>I still come to the boards and I still like EQ I will probley lose all my stuff and my characters, because I'm not sure if I'll be back before the end of the 6 months time limit. <P>If and when I do come back to play EQ I will still play the game the same way and If I stop enjoying the game.<P>I will quit with know remorse.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>hollee,<P>Thank you for the valuable insight into my psyche.  I've been posting here since September, but I've never known why.  It's been bothering me.  I appreciate you clearing up the mystery, and revealing the deep inner motivations that make me tick.<P>You must run a very successful psychic hotline.<P>There was nothing wrong with the original post as a personal statement.  By claiming to be the One Truth, and preemptively labeling anyone who might disagree a VAK, troll, or, later, addicted moron, it crossed the boundary from personal opinion to dogmatic assertion.<P>It's upon that point that reasonable people take issue.<P>Perhaps if some of you rabid Verant-bashers would take personal responsibility for your feelings and your conduct, rather than trying to make everything someone else's fault, there would be no need for Auric's crackdown.  Verant doesn't cause your feelings, _you_ do.  If you're no longer having fun, the reasonable thing to do is to take your bi-weekly McDonald's Quarter Pounder Value Meal's worth of fee and go do something you do enjoy.  Not to whine and cry and moan that Verant is somehow at fault for not building a game that meets your personal specifications.<P>It's their world, their vision, and their game.  By any reasonable metric, they are wildly successful.  Be glad you've been invited to participate in this historic endeavor, and leave quietly when you're no longer having fun.  If you feel strongly that you have suggestions how to improve the experience for those who follow you, then send them a letter explaining ways to improve.<P>Not a letter blaming them for your time away from your family, or claiming that they're stupid or incompetent or uncaring for making the changes they have.  Those are patently untrue.<P>The fact is, these changes that have all the whiners up in arms are what has kept EQ viable for so long.  No other online venture even comes close.  They've obviously learned the lessons UO failed, and kept the challenge up.  AC, attempting to cater to the EQ dissatisfaction, has not done anywhere near as well.<P>Like it or not, Verant is, by definition, doing the right things.<P>Most of these, "I'm leaving because Verant has spoiled by fun by making me need X to progress," totally miss the point of playing the game.  No one but you makes you need X ph4t 1ew+ to proceed or to have fun.  <P>"But my friends won't group with me if I don't do that!" the chorus exclaims.  Then they're not very good friends, are they?  <P>"But I can't do that cool dungeon if I don't level like crazy!" the backup singer lament.  Who said everyone, on every personal schedule, will be able to do all and see all in EQ?  That would kind of defeat the point of appealing to a wide range of interests and talents and schedules, now wouldn't it?<P>"But little Billy has stuff I don't!" cries the wanna-be powergamer.  So what.  If your fun is directly tied into competing with others, you'd be better off in Quake III Arena, where you can go head-to-head with others.<P>But quit whining that it's somehow Verant's fault your expectations don't match your abilities or schedule.  It's not; it's yours.  Had you set expectations in line with your ability or schedule, you'd have no issues; you'd simply play until you were no longer having fun, and leave.  Because it's a game, not a competition; it's only purpose is to provide a pleasant diversion from reality for the time you immerse yourself in it.  Making it anything else is a personal problem driven by lack of perspective and self-discipline, rather than a plot by the evil corporation to ensnare you and waste your time.  You have all the power: at any time, you can take your money elsewhere, with no notice and no consequences.<P>So quit with the piteous mewling, already. It's both tiresome and undignified.  And based upon patent falsehood and scapegoating.  You are responsible for your own fun, and you have the power to stay, leave, have fun, or be bored.<P>As Milton said, "The mind is its own place / And can make a hell of heav'n, or a heav'n of hell."<P>Neener.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

My personal suspicion is that Verant employees have freer reign in how they post and what they say.  <P>At any rate, Everquest is the best thing we have right now, not the best possible game, nor even really all that great.  It's just the only game in town at present and that's why people still play.  I post on here because I want the game to be better and am trying to help them make it so.

</FONT><HR>Bloodsage, first you need to relax, the tone of my posts has been calm and even, I didn't attack you nor anyone else.<P>I asked you a question, have you ever done anything more constructive than attack people who criticize Verant.  Because that is all I have ever seen you post on, and I was curious.  The reason behind it was, if this was all you have done, to hopefully get you to consider a moment the things you say and why you say them.<P>If you help people with technical problems, good, that is useful and constructive.  But I wish you would take a few moments to think about what you are saying and why before you post, because too often it looks like you are ripping off another assault without much consideration.  I know, because sometimes I do that too, and I recognize it.<P>There isn't any debate needed here, you consider Verant and the product to be flawless and attack anyone who says otherwise.  This is mistaken, but it's your opinion, I can live with that.<P>I just wish you'd find a better hobby than attacking people who disagree with you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have played EQ for about one year. During that time I have maintained by real life. My wife, who is not a player, says I have a life and she is happy I have a hobbie. <P>EQ is better than TV and it occupies about the same amount of time.<P>This is entertainment, it is not a way of life. So why are you posting here. Just quit the game and go quietly.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Grimstaff,<P>Your condescension is both unwarranted and poorly executed.<P>If your arguments are so poorly reasoned that you must resort to misguided attempts to analyze my personal life, then you should hesitate before bringing them out in public, or take the rational path and consider aligning them with common sense and logic.<P>The original poster is the one who set the tone: if you don't like the confrontational nature of this thread, it is there you should have gone for resolution.<P>And spare us the disingenuous claims of calm and reason.  Your accusations are simply that, and not even based in fact.  First, you claim there's a conspiracy to have Verant employees post here in their defense--and be exempt, somehow, from the rules--as explanation for any opinion that differs from yours.  Then you resort to direct attack upon the person, while still ignoring any of the ideas presented.  The fact that I'm involved in at least three threads on the front page, at this moment, that belie your ignorance of my habits here seems not to deter your ridiculous assumptions.<P>And your continued sidestepping of the subject of this thread.<P>If you've nothing to say on-topic, here, other than to imply anyone who disagrees with you is somehow evil, I suggest you quietly take your place with Drak and the others amongst the thoughtless whiners and bashers unable to carry on a conversation without resorting to ad hominem reasoning.<P>Otherwise, please discuss, if you can, the ideas presented in this thread, rather than the people.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064058-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064058-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064058-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064058-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064058-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064058-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064058-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=064058&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=064058&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
