</FONT><HR>There are several issues about the warrior class that should be considered. <BR>1. Taunt: In my opinion its ineffectiveness at higher levels is mainly due to our lack of damage dealing. This could possibly be remedied by allowing the warrior to increase in our abilities to land criticals and crippling blows. I've fought entire fights w/o landing one critical blow. (LONG FIGHTS!!) It doesn't seem logical that we spend level after level practicing sword play and our reward is the diminishing ability to land these blows. Also when we do land a crit it should do more damage than it does now. With more criticals and crippling blows our damagfe output goes up, then subsequently our taunt becomes more effective. <BR> Next the hate factor of taunt might need to be increased slighty (depending on how much more damage we are doing) to bring it an appropriate level.<BR> Weapons: The sword is the bread and butter weapon of the warrior. We spend our entire lives learning how to weild the sword. It's really the only weapon we have to deal damage. All of the swords on Norrath have to be made by some kind of swordmakers. Wouldn't these swordmakers be making more swords for warriors than any other class?  And wouldn't the best craftsman in Norrath be making the best swords for WARRIORS?? SURELY !!  the swords of the warrior would be at the VERY least the equal to other classes. But in my opinion, we should have THE best EPIC sword and it should probably be a little easier to obtain (but it should be NO DROP, so we all have to quest to get it) <BR> Leveling Skills: Either get rid of Disarm or fix it. If your in a fight (RL) and you disarm your opponent he's gonna do one or two things; run like mad or fight and die. When I decided to make a warrior, disarm was something I really looked forward to getting, boy am I disappointed! Other classes get much more and every four levels to boot!<BR> How bout giving the warriors some disciplines on the way to Lvl 50, not necessarily game dynamic altering skills, just some interesting abilities that we would enjoy, many ideas have already been presented in this thread.<BR> Finally, in conclusion, I think us warriors as a whole are very satisfied with our class, but this in a large degree because of our nature as warriors, we're not COMPLAINERS, we have a tendency to accept things the way they are, that's a warriors mentality. We're a relatively simple class compared to hybrids and pure casters, but it's time to make some interesting improvemnts to this class, not earth shattering, but small tweeks here and there would go a long way.<BR> Thank-you for the opportunity to express our thoughts on the matter.<BR> In your service, the WARRIOR.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I play a level 30 warrior on Seventh Hammer. While this doesn't by far make me an expert, it does give me a little experience in this class. A couple suggestions for warrior class tweaks that I would make would be:<P>1) Improve taunt. Do this for all levels. Warriors are suppose to be the group tanks, that's what we do. We are suppose to wade in and slug it out with our foes one-on-one. We are also suppose to be the ones taking the brunt of the damage, so that the thinner skinned casters and not quite as tuff hybrids don't get it. It usually doesn't work that way. All it takes is for a healer to through a healing spell on me and the critter I'm fighting takes off to wail on my healer. Then I have to taunt atleast 3 or 4 times before I can get it of the healer. By this time the healer is low on health himself and has to spend some mana on healing himself.<P>2) The warrior class specific armor (ie. crafted) should not have att. bonuses for INT or WIS. These do not help a warrior out in combat in any way, and that is the whole reason for a warrior's armor. Rather, the armor should give bonuses only to combat related attributes (ie. STR, AGI, DEX, HPs, STA, etc.)<P>3)Warriors need some sort of way to sneak past a foe. A sneak skill of some type. Almost all other classes have some way of getting in and getting out of dungeons practically unseen, if they need to. The warrior, however, only has the use of brute force to get clear, hoping that he'll make it before he runs out of health. This makes both corpse recovers (as a warrior you tend to do quite a few of these, atleast if your a good grouping warrior) a bit difficult, especially if you happen to have died deep in a dangerous dungeon which is about 3 zones from the nearest bind location.<P>4) More bind locations for warriors and other non-caster types. This will make it more likely for most of us who can't bind ourselves anywhere we like to go out explore more of the areas and dungeons around Norrath. Verrant wonders why there are so many under-utilized dungeons, this is why. Especially when your talking about the higher level dungeons. When the closest bind location is 3 or 4 zones away and atleast one of those zones is very hazardous, it tends to keep people from wanting to explore that area or dungeon. Verrant has even introduced area bonuses in these under-used areas to try to make them more inticing to adventures. You want more people to use these areas, make it so that they can be bound closer to them. <P>5) A few more 1HS weapons for those of us in the mid levels. It seems that the only good weapons for mid-level warriors are 2HS weapons. That's nice, but I like using dual wield, it really helps when fighting casting mobs. Most of the other classes have good 1HS weapons at mid-levels, the warrior class should as well. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>About the only thing I think the Warrior class is lacking is actually the Channeling skill.<P>A few months ago casting times were added to items like Pumice that are basically combat oriented items that you could argue are designed for classes like the Warrior that don't have any spells that duplicate the effect.  If we take so much as a single point of damage during the activation time of those items, then the "spell" is interupted.<P>It makes sense that the items should have casting times, but adding the channeling skill to Warriors would not affect balance in any way other than allowing us a chance to continue using items like that in combat.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Warriors are a BASE class for all the hybrids and I think can be considered almost the base for any melee class at least for comparisons sake. With that said, I can see the warriors having broad weapon profiency and that leading to all the Warrior only weaponery. And, I can see since they have no magic capabilites, whomever made these Warrior items (in terms of story line) would give them spell like abilities. What I fail to see is the difference in Hitpoints between Warriors, the Hybrids, and Monks. The defensive abilities (and ofense/weapon restrictions) should be the difference in the Pally/Shadowknight/(and maybe Bard??) and Warrior, the armor should be the difference between Rangers/Monks and the Warrior.  In terms of logic, why would warriors have this huge advantage in hitpoints? I suppose you could argue that the religious studies required of Paladins and Shadowknights might make them less active and thus less hardy (I wouldn't make that argument, just playing Devil's advocate), and Bards spend so much time in the Disco's that it takes their toll on them [eg] but Monks and Rangers? I think the hit point levels need some parity among all the melee classes and make the class differences in areas that are more logical and less arbitrary</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One other suggestion. I would leave Warrior dual weild as is, but change Ranger dual weild so that the off hand weapon is as effective as the primary weapon (really making them the masters of dual weild) and change the monks so that barehanded, they are equally effective with both hands (encouraging what I think is a major trait of the monks, pure hand to hand, no weapons). I think those changes have their own wired in drawbacks in terms or taunt and loosing out on weapon stats/effects.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As it pertains to AC of a warrior versus lets say a Shadow Knight. I play a 55th Wood Elven Warrior on Emarr, as well as a 42nd Iksar Shadow Knight. Having recently just looked through old screenshots, my warrior at 51 was wearing almost all crafted still, and his ac was at a low 792. At 55, his equip has changed much and is at 979, but thats beside the point. At 42, my Sk in almost full Dreadscale (Iksar Sk only quest stuff) has an ac of 820. Crafted is the mid-level quest armor for warriors, but yet at almost 10 levels higher on a warrior it will not beat out the AC of an iksar sk with his/her mid-level quest armor. I think an AC increase, even if its small and in the form of a defense skill bonus (maybe tack on a few AC per defense increase) is needed.<P>Then of course, there is the taunt issue, the skill is useless post 50 as it does nothing to help aggro the mob. I find myself jamming the taunt key to try and pull the mob onto myself, with no such luck. <P>Disarm - As stated, no use for it after we get it as every mob and their grandma is also a monk. Such is why this skill needs to be looked at. The only reason I use this skill is it seems to create an added taunt, albeit its quite small.<P>Antilles Darklighter<BR>55th Wood Elven Myrmidon<BR>Qenelar Darklighter<BR>42nd Iksar Crusader<BR>Phoenix Crusaders<BR>Erollisi Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am not an exterienced warrior player but my regular partner is.  My warrior is a level 11 Dark Elf but his is a 48 Gnome. I regularly play a 38 ( and moving up fast) shaman.  The biggest problems that I have seen are the high price and weight of cobalt.  There is no incentive to play anything other than barbarian, orgre or troll warriors.  Make some armor available to us other races and watch the diversity of the warrior class increase. At 48 you would think he would have better than crafted but NO, he cant afford it and the weight would be a handicap even if he could.  Make some decent armor available to the post 35 warriors that is appropriate to smaller races too.<BR>Thanks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>For a long time now i have been waiting/wanting to make a warrior.  I love the idea and have seen awesome things done by them in the game. I do not have a high lvl war, or even a 50+ char in the game. I think that the war is not balanced in class issues, I have read countless times that a smaller race has no chance in acomplishing his role later in life. I want to make a woodie war, but have hesitated because of the obvious.  I think the smaller races should have if equalness to some degree, i have asked many people in game and they have quit their small raced wars, due to the fact they cant compete in lvl. I have no suggestions on how to improve this because i do not play a war, but i do know however that many people would like to see something done about it, balance it would be nice.

</FONT><HR>Clarification on the few issues warriors have...<P>New skills are not really needed.. warriors are fairly well balanced under most circumstances. We would however like a few of the things we have work better so we can do our job.... Take damage like no other class!<P>We have the hit points and armor class to take the hits. Whether or not we get to use them relies on two things.. the effectiveness of our taunt skill, and the 'taunt' factor of our weapons.<P>The first is used when someone in our group does something that places them instantly at the top of the list.. like a large direct damage spell, or large heal. If it takes more then 3 tries to use the taunt skill to get warrior back on the top of the list, someone is in serious trouble. Best solution for this is increasing the effectiveness of taunt from 40th-60th level.<P>The second comes into play when there is someone in the group that can consistantly out damage the warrior. Simply increasing the damage a warrior can do will fix the problem, but is unbalancing.. instead, just increase the taunt factor a warrior does with weapons.. particularly 2h weapons. This would allow us to 'do our job', and not infringe on another class.<P>These two things alone are enough. The warrior is an excellent class.

</FONT><HR>LOL whoever posted that whole statical analysis between PAL/SK and WAR is obviously not very adept at understanding the meaning behind statitics.  <P>For example, you list a nice big advantage for warriors because Cobalt is better than BE/DW.  Oh yeah, well just last night I sat in Gfay and saw two auctions on the same page... Jbone Arms 3K, Cobalt Arms 20K.  Ok, shamans aren't hybrids blah blah blah.  My point is that you are comparing things are if they are equal in all ways.  I don't have any statistics on how much more rare each cobalt piece is than the corresponding BE/DW piece (and remember comparing the difference between each piece by adding the percentages is so very flawed in the first place) but what good is a comparison when the drop rates are so low that most of us can't get it in the first place?  Would you prefer to compare the full crafted that I'm wearing at 51 to your DW pieces???<P>Bottom line is this...<P>Absor has basically rejected any suggested improvement arguing that warriors have been the base class and there's no way improvements to other classes have unintentionally underpowered warriors in the process.  The only thing he will accept from these threads are suggestions for nerfs.<P>Ok everybody, let's get this over with.  It's obvious that warriors are going to be nerfed but maybe we can at least mislead Absor into nerfing things that we don't really care about.  Damage mitigation is our speciality, I think we should put it to use on this topic.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Disarm is the best skill ever!  Disarm is great, every warrior loves it!  It's our very very very very best skill!  Don't nerf disarm, nerf anything but that!!!<P>Also, he seems big on nerfing invis on the legs.  I say we just give that to him and be happy if we can come out of this will that being one of the few nerfs.<P>*sweating as the nerf stick hangs overhead*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I truthfully haven't read the entire listing of posts here.  There is now way I'm going through everyone's posts to read a book on how they feel about this class. <P>I started my warrior back about 1 week after eq went public (no crits, no extra hp, no MR - it was a ranger without spells and 200 extra hp at 50).  Since then I've seen it get tweaked and adjusted into its final form and have been happy all the way.  <P>Only suggestions -  Taunt post 50 is still rough - kinda a class defineing trait that needs a little tweaking - an increased cap would make sense.<P>The Aggressive Discipline - I never use it.  All it seemed to do was make stuff hit me twice as hard for a barely noticeable increase in damage.  Not critical to the class to fix IMO , but be nice if it did something (evasive, defensive, precise are all noticeable and work perfectly - whats the dilly w/ aggressive?).  <P>The epic is sorta lack luster for its difficulty - but in a way I like that.  Warriors get defined by their equipment , probably more so than any other class.   Using the same cookie cutter weapon as everyone else would be boring.  Much rather be forced to choose among a variety of weapons.  Sorta wish that weapon never went into the game.<P><BR>Right now I feel a level 60 warrior is "perfectly balanced".  If fixing taunt means nerfing something else - dont fix it.  If changing aggressive means nerfing something else - don't fix it.  Don't fix what isn't broken.......PLEASE!<P>Junx Munch<BR>60 Warlord<BR>Innoruuk<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My 2 cp on the warrior topic :<P>On the HP/AC : Well, i don’t have much to say about it. All seems fine for me, even the fact that large race get more hp than the small and that a large race SK can have quite the same amout of HP as a small race warrior.<BR>Maybe what i’m saying is not true after 50 .. but before 50 yes … i see friends that have around the same number of HP and AC and they are Troll SK (i play a Dark Elf Warrior).<P>On Resist : that seems a very good things that make warrior more powerfull and that help me a lot when i am fighting againt necro, shaman type mobs .. i can resit fear and slow.  <P>On the equipment, the one who said that warrior were rich is dumb ! I explain my self, as a warrior i am always looking to get better gear, but better gear means higher price … the question is : how do i get money ?<P>1) Farming things i can : that means killing mob 10 to 20 lvl lower than me (in aplce where mob would not agro because i am too good for them)… trying to kill a blue mob is pretty  too dangerous if i am alone (Yes i could go in a group but that would then mean Roll .. and roll involve luck so i may get nothing …so alone is the only way)<P>2) Selling/trading the gear i am wearing on me and hopping i’ll find a better things in the hour … or well i would have screwed up my equipment<P>3) Going in dangerous place, where i am not sure to find a group … and hope to be lucky with the roll.<P>So which solution do you prefer ? Personnaly, only the 1 st solution is valid like i am not in a huge guild and that few zare in my range (2-3 max .. and we are all war or SK).<P>I got a necro friend, while i spend a lot to get my gear, he spent 10 times more in Bone chips to be able to enter in Cabilis and to increase his trade skills (Mostly jewelry ) …. So who is really rich ?<P>On AD&D warrior :<BR>AD&D warrior are equals in lots of point to Paladin BUT they are by FAR much better than ANY other class for weapon. They can be masters in all kind of weapon (5 att/2 round) while a Pal can only do (3/2). <BR>That was the main différence between a warrior and Pal in the 2nd Edition.<P>With the 3rd Edition, warrior have completly change, they have now a vast choice of competence and they get one every 2 lvl. That make a Huge difference in my opinion with Pal wich don’t have that much change.<P>Now, as someone said earlier, a 20 lvl warrior is a killing machine even with a nomal blade and a leather armor. In EQ, the equipement makes ALL the difference for a melee type.<P>Ex : 2 friend a 32 lvl rogue (full ravenscale armor and serated bone dirk + burning rapiere) and 30 lvl monk (cure silk + 2 fighting baton) did engage another player in PvP. The other was a warrior around lvl 25-28 …. Trust me or not but they were unable to kill the warrior. Why ? simple : full cobal + cloack of flame + wurmslayer + another weapon).<P>Do you really think that kind of situation is normal ? ? ? ? Me, i don’t think so. Try with 2 AD&D personnages even with crappy equipment againt a warrior 3-8 lvl under them…well the warrior = dead at 100%<P>I think there is work to do to prevent that kind of situation, but i have no valid solution for you … sorry… or … make all 1 class equipement NO drop (quest armor, weapon, etc..) but this is maybe not the proper solution &#61516;<P>Magical Effect :<BR>Well, i don’t have magical with a righ click effect on … how ever from what i can see, some effect of the cobalt should maybe be review and more in the warrior way.<BR>- Helm - Infra : ok usefull for barb / human but this is all … not worth for all others<BR>- Bracer – shrink : usefull for 3 race … again useless for all others …. And further more you put it on a bracer .. a item that people can wield 2 at the same time. Maybe you could have forgotten that on bracer and put i on a gorget ? Or make bracer 1 and bracer 2 with 2 different effect ?<BR>- BP – invogorate – Ok .. nice little healing … at least it can help after a fight.<BR>- Vambrace – minor shielding (forgot if this is the right item/effect) : seems good for a warrior … nice little bonus<BR>- Glove – str buff : every one say that is this not good … i will not argue … maybe the effect can be replace by a Sta or agi or dex buff ?<BR>- Greave – inv : well this is maybe the most usefull spell to explore a zone, or travel. If you want to remove it, you won’t make friend for sure … and i don’t think that the inv spell disturb that much the game …. This is really minor compare to the number of player that have that item.<BR>- Boots – str buff : nothing to say .. seems fine especillay for non large.<P><BR>They spell effect that could have been good for a warrior :<BR>- permanent invigor (regen stamina) .. or very fast casting spell ….like that it will be good for long fight and we would not bother priest/shaman for that (i often disturb them with that like i only have 75 in sta + 5 (in items))<BR>- summon arrow.<BR>- Food/drink summon or band <BR>- Fire fist click effect (increase ATK)<P>I think that if you have to do or change spell on items, make them what a warrior would use the most in battle or just before/after battle. <P>An idea .. i will be flame for it but this is ok : why not put some more restriction on spell (right click and proc ?). After all who can better understant how a weapon work and the true powers it has than a very smart or wise one ? Like that you could do some weapon with various effect but only if you have the proper stats (ie lvl 20, 60 wis, 75 dex …and so on).<P>At least you can take that idea for another future game. In that way people would have more various equipment and each races would have good and bad weapon predilection …. <P>Soloing :<BR>What ever you can say , it is possible for a warrior to solo up to lvl 25 … after this is pretty difficult but still possible if you have uber items (cobal BP for exemple). Before lvl 20, well a soloing warrior is not bad and i don’t think that it disturbs the game … after yes.<P>I really see now a difference of XP when grouping and alone … i can take right now quite a lvl for 4/5 hours of play when i am in a full group while it would have taken me days if i was soloing some low blue mob qand with much greater risks.<P>So, making the warrior as a group friendly IS the best for us … we cannot live without the others but the others are not that good without us &#61514;<P>Disarm skill :<BR>Ok, as far as i know this skill is not usefull at all exept against another melee in PvP … but this is all. It could be possible if :<BR>1) mob always use weapon (all warrior/rogue type … and a bit for the others)<BR>2) mobs did not do THAT much domage with hands ….. even a monk don’t do as much dmg as they do. I don’t speak about animal …but all those that can use weapon should be profency with it but less with bare hand. They should also do less DMG with hand  (and not the same wear as they are having a weapon or not and that you have 100 AC or 1000  AC …)<P>This is also a valid point for rogues.<P>New skill :<BR>- New AOE taunt : nice idea, i like it<BR>- The cutting strike : this would only be possible with slash weapon : It would cut an arm/leg of someone in RP .. in real that would mean that the mob lose a X% of his total hp.<BR>&#61664; should be use with a timer and a for a short duration 10 sec max<BR>Other version could be aquire too « the bone breaker » for blunt and « the surgery strike » for percing.<P>Those skill : blunk could be gotten by monk too, percing for rogue and why not slash for hybrid. (moslty SK/Pal)<P>We could also add a deadlier version later on (why not by doing a quest …). The effect could be the death or 2 or 3 times what the 1st version would do. The timer would be the same as the 1st one … and could be use like once every 30 min maybe ….<P>Shield as cloak :<BR>Well, why not put that in a skill too ? Warrior, SK, Pal can use shield in a back slot if they have the proper insight …. That seems a not so bad solution, don’t you think ? But that could cause some problem with the others classes that use a shield (like druid, priest, shaman ..rogue too i think .. and bard ? ?)<P>Percing : I disagree with you Alan on that .. if we are the master of battle the we should be able to master all weapon to the max lvl … or down the warrior others weapon skill so it maches the percing cap.<P>The epic weapon :<BR>For me, this is really an epic quest that a warrior can do. Maybe the best quest compare to the others. We really have Epic situation (3 planes, 2 dragon, the queen) … no really this is all fine for me. The only think that may bug me is :<BR>1) you need good group to kill the specifics mobs<BR>2) the non common drop of our items.<P>So please, either allow the drop to be common or make it random for everyone …<P>Berzeker STR + crit + crip :<BR>Well if you have another things to get off this is that … of course this is the skill that make a warrior different to a SK or Pal, but is it really that usefull ? Will that same my life or those of my friend like a HT or LoH could do ? Personnaly i don’t think so. Yes making crit is nice …. How ever a crit can be a true joke sometimes. That would not bother me too much to lose it (exept the str bonus maybe ;p jk …). If you leave can you revamp it so it can be more usefull in a group ?<P>Well i hope someone ca comment that and tell me the good/bad points.<P>Have fun<P>Menaden<BR>DE Warrior<BR>Forsaken Legion</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm seeing some comparisons here between warriors and the hybrids.<P>I wanted to re-emphasize that these numbers, as close as they are coming out to be anyway, are still rather off.<P>Most paladins are humans/high-elves.  Shadowknights have a lot of dark-elves/erudites in their ranks now due to the high INT of those races.  Most warriors are troll/ogre/barbarian.<P>So when you're comparing the classes and seeing that Paladins come out with 90% of the HP of a warrior, bear in mind the race difference accounts for probably 5% of that.<P>If you compared only same-race class varieties, I believe you'd find that buffed hybrids already fall within 5% of the HP of buffed warriors.<P>Our HP advantage is already nearly non-existant.  We give up spells but do not gain much in exchange.  Even now, until you get to your level 55 disicipline, there is no reason to want to be a warrior rather than a shadowknight.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I play a L51 Wood Elf Warrior on Fennin Ro, most people have made good points.<P>1.) Taunt needs to be more ffective<BR>2.) Cobalt needs to be more common, prices on it are too high and many piece end up on twinks rather than 1st Generation warriors.<BR>3.) The warrior epic drops need to be adjusted Anicent Blade(Queen), Maestros hand, Spiroc Wing Blade(Spiroc Lord) all need to be made common or maybe a 75 percent drop rate.<BR>4.) A Long time ago Pally/SK got a HP bonus to put then ahead of rangers.  We need that bonus back.<BR>5.) A new point Indicolite drops in Htae need to be increased to match cleric drops.  In 9 hate raids I have seen like 10 Warrior drops and easily over 40 Cleric drops.  Last 2 raids we have had 0 drops and we always have 5-7 warriors competing for drops.<P>    On a personal note I play a Wood Elf warrior and I worship Tunare.  I have stayed true to my god and often watched as many Wood Elf Warriors have gone off to growth to slay their "friends".  They do this because so far no Wood Elf/Half Elf Tunare worshiping warrior quest has been found. Good roleplaying is not beign rewarded in this case.  We need a quest equivalent to the Natures defender for Paladins.  Wood Elves and Half Elves make dismal enough warriors(Yes Hide and Forage do not make up for the offensive abilities of Ogres, Troll and Babrs)we need to be rewarded if we are to be good roleplayers and stick with our Mother Tunare.  If not a 2HS sword maybe a Nice BP with Chloro on it.  <P>Trajan Focht L51 Wood Elf Warrior Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Akriss...<P><BR>I am a level 60 Warrior and would like to make a few comments and suggestions. I created my warrior only a few hours after the servers went live. I struggled to enjoy a warrior in the early days but much of that was fixed by the time I was level 30. I must say you have all done pretty well in developing the warrior since then. But there are a few things that could be worked on.<P>1) Disciplines. Is it just me or are the disciplines from level 56 on up just kinda...junk. They are of little use and I have never seen anyone use them on a regular basis. I think they should be looked into and maybe improved a bit. I could make a few suggestions on that but I will hold that for later.<P>2) I remember somewhere in this thread someone mentioning a AE taunt. This would be EXTREMELY helpful in those situations where your pulled just @%#%ed up and you need to get as many mobs off your enchanters, clerics, etc in a split second.<P>3) What if warriors got a Disc or a high level skill called "War Cry". Basically it would have the same effect as "Instill Doubt". I think it would be a nice addition to warriors to be able to let out such a horrific war cry that it has the potential to actually frighten and fear away creatures. This would be extremely useful and something new and fun for warriors.<P>4) Last suggestion would be to let warriors bandage up to 100% depending on level. I heard this posted somewhere and is also a very good idea. I think around level 58-60 a warrior should be able to bandage himself up to 100% of his health if he wanted. This would not make him more powerful in any way and would be of GREAT help when it comes to shortening down time, etc.<P>I think all of these would be great additions and should be considered strongly. I hope to see some new perks and little improvements on warriors in the future. But to be honest...I am pretty satisfied with the way they are now.

</FONT><HR>I would just like to add a couple suggesstions- as a warrior I find that creatures that con blue to me still do a good 30 damage (I'm level 17). This is a little crazy, because they still knock me down to 1/3 of my health. We are supposed to tank after all, but this is not tanking to me. Also, I believe that as tanks we should be able to dual wield heavier weapons without getting so tired. A taunt upgrade would also be nice. These are only suggestions, but I feel they maight be valid.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> Delheru, I don't know where you got your numbers from, but they are way off.  My level 60 warrior (in an uberguild) has never even seen 5000 hp, let alone 6000.  And that's with every possible buff... <P>  Not to pick on Delheru specifically here, but IMHO this is the biggest problem with these class threads.  Much of the information that people post is simply not true, and often Verant is not able to tell the difference between what is and is not true (that's not a knock against Verant here, it would be impossible for any company to know everything they need to know about a game this complex).  And sometimes classes get nerfed on the basis of false information.  <P>  From the tone of Absor's post, I highly suspect that warriors are going to see nothing but nerfs come out of the class changes in the near future.  And many of those nerfs are going to come about because Verant has been misinformed by class-envy posts from hybrids.  <P>  The rule here seems to be that if you don't complain bitterly that you hate your class, Verant is likely to assume you are overpowered, and you will get nerfed.    <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

How about if you disarm a creature, it, in effect stuns the creature for say, 5 seconds, to allow him to pick his weapon back up.<P>So in effect, you disarm, the weapon disappears from his hand, he is stunned for 5 seconds, it reappears in his hand, after the 5 seconds, and begains to attack again.<P>This would be VERY USEFUL then, and make it worth jamming the disarm key all through combat.<P>Sound good? any other veriations?<P>Crohmm Stormfury<BR>52nd Warrior of Rodcet Nife.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My two cents.   I have never played a warrior past 4th level.  I just thought this could be a useful suggestion from what I have seen.<P>All classes but warriors have something they can do to save thier buts if the crap hits the fan.<P>Casting classes get gate and any number of other things.<P>Monks get Feign Death<BR>Paladins have Lay on Hands and stun spells<BR>SK's have Harm Touch and Feign Death<BR>Rangers have roots and sow<BR>and Bards, well, we out run everyone (I love selo's)<P>My suggestion is to give a low level disipline to warriors called sprint or something similar.  It would give the warriors SOW like speed for 15 seconds and could recycle once every 30 minutes.  This wouldn't be all that good for dungeons or higher levels where mobs can summon, but it would be great for outdoor zones when something jumps you or if you just realize you are going to die.  It would give you enough of a jump to get ahead of the mobs chasing you and you could possibly make it to zone.<P>Kentaris</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alot of dicussion here about all sorts of things, I 'd like to take a small amout of time to look at things as a whole in the melee realm.<P>Warriors are indeed the baseline tank, but I think we are loosing focus as a whole on melee. <P>For one thing the other melee classes have seen alot of improvements as far as damage ouput. And lets face it, taunt has not been touched in any signifigant maner. To do his job a tank needs to taunt effectively, and as it is cannot any longer after 50. So acros the board among all tank classes taunt should be improved to balance out damage output from other classes that has increased.<P>Now balance on the whole is somewhat subjective because we have to look at each classses job in relation to each other. And I will state now that among melee classes there are two roles support/offence and tank/defence.<P>Tank/defense is of course Warriors, Palies, and the ever lovable SK's.<P>Support/offence is the wonderfull rogue, ranger, and monk.(Post 50 a bard is an armored caster with monor offencive capabilities)<P>A quick look at support melee looks pretty good at the monent, the happiest of these is the rogue and the main issues the others have is when you are talking to one that thinks thier role is tank(which it is not).<BR>The purpose of these classes is to bring home the bacon on melee damage and stay alive with trickery. Obviously the ranger needs a new trick here. Jolt comes too late and is a spell, and as such is not castable when it is needed(when your being beat on). I to this day think rangers should have never had taunt.<P>Now for the nitty gritty of why we are here. Tanks<P>Warriors define this role, and should continue to.<BR>Palies and SKs are meant to give up something to get magic. And as it stands the "something" is not defined in a "actual combat" way. But I submit to you that most of these classes would happily accept being tied at second in melee offence to the warrior. Making thier defensive caps lower than a warrior is just plain silly. <BR>They also both have the limitation of not being able to dual wield, this is signifigant in damage output in some situations and is a sacrafice.<P>Now as far as thier offencive caps, my sympaty for them lessons. Warriors spend 100% of their time killing things. Palies and SKs spend some of thier time learning magic. And so I belive that while thier offencive melee camps should be sufficient for them to hit creatures of higher levels I think they should be able to do less on an offencive/melee situation. Their special abilities and thier spells should balance them out with the warrior in damage output. I say this once again restating that damage output is NOT the main job of the tank.<P>So in short the tanks should be equal defensively, and thus interchangable in thier base role. This would make them balanced.<P>As far as Damage output they all have thier way of delivering it. As it stands it does equal out.<P>If you feel you have to nerf something, nerf disarm. Because it is SO usefull.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First off, I'm very happy being a warrior.  I don't regret my decision one iota, and a dark elf warrior to boot.  Here are just a few suggestions I would like to make:<P>1.) I would like to see the big drop armors like cobalt made no drop.  The person from earlier said it best that it's really discouraging to be running around at 50+ level and see a twink that's only 10th running around in Cobalt.  But it goes for the others as well to me, make it all no drop.  After all, the big planes armor is no drop, and rightly so, but the Kunark armors aren't.  That's one thing right off the bat I'd look at adjusting.<P>2.) Taunting, I was thinking of some type of taunt hit we could do possibly if the mobs back was turned to us.  I'm not suggesting serious beat down damage from it, but maybe hits from behind help to make the taunt work better.  Just an evade in full reverse.<P>3.) More bind points.  This I think would help all the non caster types.  I don't think it would be right to be able to bind in Innothule Swamp since Grobb is right down the path, but maybe just a few extra places here and there in Kunark would help.  Trust me, being a dark elf and helping bard friends and such do their quests in Kunark is destroying my Overthere Faction, and I really can't safely take the boat from Port Faydwer to Firiona Vie either.<P>Really other than that, I'm very happy with the warrior class, and even if these things don't change, I'm still gonna play the warrior.<BR>Thanks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR> Ah, warriors. What is there to say about them? They are easily my favorite class and the only character I ever play on is my warrior. We are great and every group needs at least a few of us, but there are many things that need improving. Now, being only in my 20th battle, I will only be able to talk about things that I've actually encountered (no epic talk).<BR>Issues...<P>1.Taunting: This is a skill that had a great idea, but just wasn't made well. The main problem is, since casters do much more damage than us, they tend to get the MOB on them. This is where taunting should come in handy, but it normally takes literally around 10-15 taunts just to get a MOB off of a much more fragile group member! This takes up a lot of time, and at least 50% of the time at least one group member will die before I can get the MOB on me! Come on Verant, fix this in a non-distant patch please!<P>2. HP and AC. Sadly enough, many of my non-warrior friends have around 100 more ac than I, and almost rival my HP! This somewhat eliminates the "tanking" ability of warriors if non-warriors rival their HP and AC! Again, Verant, boost our HP at least 200 points or so, and give our armor more AC than non-warrior armor!<P>3. I believe (just my own belief, although many share it) that when a warrior gets to let's say his 30th season (halfway to maximum) he should be able to dual wield 2 hand slashing weapons! This would make us a very more unique and fun class, and we would really be true warriors! Anyway, can't you picture an Ogre, Troll, or Barbarian dual wielding two Axe of the Iron Backs over them dual wielding two hatchets? Come on!<P>      Zanakus Kargoror<BR>      Barbarian Warrior of the 20th battle<BR>      &lt;Knights of Rathe&gt;<BR>      Rallos Zek<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Warrior issues:<P>Going to try and only mention ones that you haven't already covered, Absor.  (Most have already been mentioned in this thread already, but haven't been commented on yea or nea.  Would be nice to know if you don't like an idea, rather than not knowing if you didn't notice it or not)<P>Critical Hits:<P>Their frequency only changes with increases to dexterity, and that's fairly marginal from what I can tell.  Rather than changing the minimum dmg (which admittadly would be nice, but I don't see it happening), increase the frequency that we get crits as we get higher level.  Don't make it a clickable button, it dosen't need that level of reworking.<P><BR>Warrior Epic Weapon:<P>Increase the frequency of the drops for it. We have some seriously bad mobs to go after, and there's alot of us trying for these items.  (In the case of the red dragonscale, bards also need this).  *PLEASE* make them a constant drop from their respective critters.<BR>The weapon itself is nice, but the majority of tank weapons add haste while ours dosen't? *boggle*<BR>Also, make the scabbard some kind of reward in itself. (Maybe add the haste efect to the scabbard rather than the sword?)  Have it increase some stats, with a focus on AC and protection, and make it a back slot item.  (It's worn on the back of the NPC in Freeport, if I recall correctly, so why not?)  At the very least, a weightless container.<P>Equip a 2 handed sword with a shield at high levels:<P>Now THIS is an interesting idea.  Woiuld take some work to make it work good without overbalancing, but it would be a KILLER ability completely unique to warriors, and make shields useful to us again.  (When was the last time you saw a warrior who used a shield, other than for special case functions like resists or click-procs?)  And the Uni Shield dosen't count, it's really a piercing weapon with an AC bonus.  =-)<P>Replace the invisibility efect on the Cobalt pants with:<P>Effect: Summon Redhaired Female Woodelf.  =-)<P>Razorback Levinphyre<BR>Officer of the Knights of the Arcane<BR>Bristlebane<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Good idea, Slamz.  Here's the same statsheet using only human paladins, sks, and warriors polled for hps:<P>Paladin: 2401hps (unbuffed, 85 percent warrior), 4381hps (buffed, 91 percent warrior)<P>Shadowknight: 2229hps (unbuffed, 79 percent warrior), 4209hps (buffed, 88 percent warrior)<P>Warrior: 2825hps unbuffed, 1805hps buffed.<P>This comparison is more accurate than my previous one, because it profiles the base race only.  Racial modifiers are not included.<P>The final outcome is similar, only the paladin and shadowknight have swapped places.  This is likely due to the removal of trolls and ogres from the sampling on the sk side, and half elves and high elves on the paladin side.<P>I think the numbers still stand:  Any hp increase for sks or paladins would close the gap between those classes and the warriors so much that high hps will no longer be a class specific advantage.<P>Now, about damage:<P>Warriors have dual wield.  With excellent weapons, we can do some good damage here.  Paly's and SKs cannot dual wield, but their class specific one-handers are designed to make up for this.  Ebon Mace anyone?  Delay 24, dmg 19?  Halcyon Broadsword?  Delay 25, dmg 18?<P>Yes, warriors do more damage.  We have higher combat skill caps.  Dual wield does help.  But it's not by as much as you think.  And when was the last time damage output was ever a considering factor for any of these three classes to join a group or a raid?  A group could care less if you're using a rusty bastard sword over two handed BA sword of Death as long as you can continue to do your job effectively, the job of keeping the mob's attention so the real damage can be done by the casters.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One interesting thing came to mind after reading a previous post: ShadowKnights and Paladins have to practice spell casting and holy/unholy matters, rogues have to practice being sneaky, so what do warriors practice all day long?  (and don't say disarm plz)  The Art of War.  Where is this gruesome fighter you see on the EQ box art or the fan art?  A warrior in EQ doesn't inspire feelings of dread in his opponents.  MOBs should be quaking in their boots at the sight of someone who has done nothing but study day and night to slay an oppenent with a heavy hunk of metal.  I mean, that's all warriors do, right?  They are basically a very boring class!<P>I'm not saying give us more damage or more hitpoints, just give us one clear advantage, one clear ability that sets us apart.  I'm tired of being the "staple class"!  Lower our damage output if it means you can give us a hunk of hitpoints!  Take away an ability if it means we have 150% more AC than the hybrid standing next to us!  I just want to have something that defines us besides our warrior-only equipment, where a high level anonymous character can stride into battle and have an onlooker say, "Wow!

</FONT><HR>I would like to suggest that a warrior weapons upon death be soul bound. As a warrior we are the base class and we are very formidable in a group. The main handicap I due encounter more than anything else is corpse recovery. At higher levels this is less of an issue because of the availability of resurrection. <P> Up in till that point however we are forced to run back to our corpses. Naked we have to means to avoid detection like our melee brethren. Rangers get cammo, Shadow knights get Gather Shadows, Paladins get Invis vs. Undead, Rogues get hide + sneak, and monks get feign death. <P> As a warrior our only option is to beg for these services, /consent someone if possible, or press our luck. My suggestion would be allow us to have whatever weapon(s) are in our melee slots to return with us upon death. This would at least allow us a fighting chance at a safe corpse recovery.

</FONT><HR>I play a 44 troll warrior on Tarrew Marr. One contention I have always had was that warriors beyond a certain level are unable to solo, and yet other classes that were not "intended" to be able to solo can and do so successfully well into their 50's, while we as fighters must group, often times to die against uber mobs as we are sent in to "distract" enemies while our casters take the mob out.  One fix I have seen to this is mobs who ignore pet classes and go for the caster.  If the caster is sowed all they have to to is run around and let the pet beat on it from behind, and voila, still able to solo.<P>When the disciplines were first introduced I thought wow, finally they are thinking of us and giving us something we can use.  Then you gave the hybrids disciplines, thus in my opinion putting us warriors out of whack again.  Then i saw the monk Ashen fist, which has the potential to "kill an opponent in one successful hit."  Come on, why would you let monks do something with their bare hand when you won't give that ability to warriors using a weapon.  Thus in my opinion the classes are not balanced in that respect, but I still love the game so OH WELL!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Add in right click spells on your armor and proccing weapons to give you some versatility.<P>I don't understand what you're asking for here when you're complaining you don't have a single thing that outshines Paladins and SK's.  You have all of those things better as you've requested, plus in the high level game you are able to tank mobs no SK or Paladin can hope to even attempt to tank.  With your defensive discipline alone you become the sole class able to particpate in a tanking capacity on these raids.  Maybe I missed something in your post, but I'm not following your concern here.<P>There may well be issues for lower level warriors that need work, I really can't say anything about that. But I can say that in the high level game, warriors are pretty damn impressive. They hold a role that no one else can even begin to attempt to perform in their place.<P>In support of warriors, I do agree that cobalt drop rates need help.  Those helms and bracers just aren't dropping.<P>I agree that they need some help with taunt, whether its that AOE taunt idea or something that helps them a bit more on those high level mobs.<P>I agree that the mobs they need to kill for their epic are pretty extreme for the quality of the epic weapon they receive.  That needs a good solid look/comparison to the "better" epics (Ranger/Rogue).<P>I agree that they may need to swap two disciplines that seem out of order with respect to when they're acquired.<P>I can't agree that you need more hit points, more AC, special ability to travel unhindered, higher piercing caps, more disciplines etc.  You're already THE required class for high level play in conjunction with a cleric.  As the baseline for melee tuning, you're fine.<P>I haven't seen many SKs or Paladins say they want to infringe on the Warrior's role as a chief/sole/super tank.  They just want to have a chance at a place in a group as the second tank, rather than having another warrior/rogue/monk get that place automatically, because of their lower AC and lack of damage output.  SK's/Paladins are asking to be in a position where they can be second best at absorbing the damage - not first. We were at one time able to take up that role, before Kunark changed everything.<P>I just don't get it I guess.  Warriors, clerics and rogues (and one enchanter to buff) are the staples for a high level group now, particularly in Velious.  How can you say you don't have a single thing that makes you desired above SKs/Paladins?<P>/boggle<P>Noamu'Chath BloodOath<BR>Grave Lord<BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Idont get it. they can rais the caps for SK and Paladins so at the higher levels they can get almost the same hp and ac as we have, they can rais thier offence and defence caps to be almost the same as our and then they tell us we need to be nerfed? I have a 54th level warrior. I have 2 pieces of cobalt. my 55th level paladin friend has more ac than I do and selfed buffed 200 more HP than me. Hmmmm I dont see them neededing more ac or Hp .  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 11 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;9&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053599-11.html">11</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053599&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053599&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
