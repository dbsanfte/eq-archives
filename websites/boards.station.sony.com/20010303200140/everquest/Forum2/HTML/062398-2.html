Unless they change agro back, or signifigantly re tune the mobs the game is now over at 60.<P>Lets face it, this may not be a bad business strategy for Verant, lord knows the high level population is terminaly overcrowding the servers, but that doesnt change the fact that they killed their own game in the interests of perserving it.<P>Mudwimping at its finest<P>Abatoir<BR>&lt;Talisman&gt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Eduin:<P>It's not my intent coming here to start arguments with anyone, it has been requested that those of us that are "trying out the new changes" come here and post our thoughts and feedback.<P>Honestly?  Fighting mobs from lvl 1 to oh.. say 54-56 is really not going to be so bad.  The reason mainly being is these mobs aren't going to hit so hard so healing isn't required too early in the fight.<P>Now go up against Lord Yelinak, a handfull of ToV drakes, Klandicar, Zlandicar, Lord Dain, King Tormax, etc... these encounters (except the drakes) are all "broken" as far as I'm concerned because as soon as the fight starts the tanks need heals... what happens next?  Because sufficient aggro isn't built up and the tank doesnt have enough "hate points" the cleric jumps in and slam dunks his CH and immediately goes to the top of the list.  Why doesnt this make sense to you guys?<P>I'd go as far as to invite you guys to come to Veeshan and WATCH what happens to us but a:  You'd die right away to the 1k damage AE... b:  I'm not in a position to do that.<P>Let's understand something, I don't come here and try and preach the word of God or Allah or anyone else but I know I'm not stupid.. I am confident that I have a fair understanding of how the game works, and how hate is established and I feel strongly that the *HIGH LEVEL* game is now drastically different than it was before.<P>Changing tactics is fine with me, but looting my corpse every 10 minutes isn't.<P>Here's a SUGGESTION:<P>Where mob X is (i) above level Y or (b) hits for ZZ or above reduce hate gained by 40-50%.  Or something... how about a BUFF that acts like a damage shield and is only activated when hit at low health and procs jolt.... so like:<P>My tank goes in, starts beating down mob... needs a heal so I remedy/CH.  My "buff" is up at this point so when the mob aggros on me I get beat down to like 300-400 hps right away but now the damage shield kicks in, procs jolt on the mob and now its off me.. I can heal myself quick and get ready for the next attack.<P>I don't know if you can make it active by how much damage is received but at least its a suggestion.<P>When you come up with something besides "learn how to play your class" please reply, I think I speak for alot of people when I say "PLEASE FIX THE DAMAGE YOU HAVE DONE VERANT".</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Eduin I think in your example of 2 monks and a cleric you will have a problem whereas in the 3-4 rounds it takes for the monk to NEED to feign he will either have success and possibly get a heal or die.  As soon as the cleric casts heal on the 1st monk he *is* going to be aggrod on and 90% chance of death at this point.<P>Additionally, you are obsessing on Furor's "story" a little too much.  If it weren't Furor it would be Fuuh, Krurk, myself, Millie or Geao doing the tanking... we WANT Furor doing it if he's there because he has the highest AC/HPS of everyone present.<P>There really are no two ways around it man, these high level encounters are lopsided in the NPC's favor at this point.  No, it is NOT impossible to win but YES (can I repeat that, YES) it is now VERY lopsided in terms of damage/hate and the healing classes are getting OWNED TOO EARLY in the battle.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>Well regarding CoH, it simply belongs to the cheesy type of tactics you have to patch a broken situation.<P>It's a 12 sec cast so in theory it can land on a cleric right after he CHeals (10 sec cast), if WELL timed. It also costs a lot of mana (700 I think) so you can cast a limited number of those before going OOM.<P>And then it also requires a mage for every healer, and the magician must also be in the same group. So instead of a raid requiring enough clerics, warriors and damage dealers, you'd also need to have enough magicians show up for a raid to happen.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Mythral,<P>  If the CoH idea would work, it would be no more a cheesy tactic then the recent "cleric/warrior with CH" tactic. This requires 0 skill and I never understood why Verant would make mobs this way. So it requires an additional group member, a mage, whoopee. I am simply trying to figure out a way to still do these things, without drastically increasing party members. A mage would be good for about 4 CoH by himself, have a necro pumping him mana you be all set.<P>Mill</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Eduin,<P>So basically you are saying, "Hey Furor, it's time you throw your taunt skill and the ability to tank right out the window. You aren't needed anymore."<P>These kind of mobs are the ones that Furor and other high level warriors will be fighting almost exclusively. You are saying they should be useless in these encounters? That is just plain stupid.<P>I can understand having select mobs that ignore a warrior's taunt so that you have to work around it, but having every single high level mob laugh at your taunt skill as they beat the healers to death is NOT why people play warriors.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There is also a 'hidden' problem with the healing changes. We were doing Sky a couple of days ago and mezzing a few of the 2nd or 3rd splits on Bazzazzt Island. All the while these suckers were mezzed they were accumulating aggro for every CH a cleric threw down. By the time we got to the last one I had about 30000pts of 'hidden' aggro accumulated on the stupid bee. Nothing short of an act of God would have taken it off me.<P>It really is nuts that on mobs like Dain Yelinak Vindicator Velketor Tormax etc, you need a CH on your lead warrior within 3 seconds, and if he doesnt get it he dies - and yet if he DOES get it, the cleric dies.<P>ToV is another broken zone since these changes I would have to agree. The mobs are to all purposes untauntable after a CH.<P>The changes are over the top - way overdone. It is not a clerics job to tank, and warriors should have SOME method of getting to the top of the hate list, even if it only has a 25% chance of working. Currently the chance stands at exactly ZERO %</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Eduin with all due respect, what are you smoking? Anyone that has actualy participated in uber encounters now that these most recent changes have totally destroyed the high level balance of the game.<P>Sure everything in your average day OS group or whatever is fine but when it comes to LARGE 30+ people encounters things are just crazy. A warriors role is to taunt and tank. A clerics role is to heal/buff. When a warrior cannot perform his role correctly then the game is broken. Having to resort to having clerics gate out after every wacked out super aggro or use coh isn't the way the game should be played. Those are cheese tactics and DO NOT make the game fun.<P>What I can't understand is why verant takes almost every single tactic a guild/group comes up with for beating a high level encounter and totaly destroys/nerfs it. The changes made looked great on paper I'm sure. But VI failed to realize the effect it would have on the UBER encounters. <P>Changes need to be made soon.<P><BR>Radek the Elementalist<BR>Raidek Robott<BR>60th Magician, 53rd Rogue<BR>Prophecy - Bertoxxulous<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>mages are now required for the uber end encounters, every tank group has a cleric and a mage in it, mage must know EXACTLY when the cleric is going to cast ch, anticipate it well enough to begin casting CotH at the same time the cleric begins with ch, that way the cleric only has to deal with 2 seconds of attack before having his agro cleared by the mage when he's summoned (trying to cut it any closer than that chances that CotH goes off before ch and the tank dies). the mage is standing way back from the fight waith a secondary healer, well out of agro range, soon as the cleric appears, a secondary healer freshens up his hp and the cleric runs back down to issue the next ch, CotH takes about 15 seconds to refresh, so tanks will have to be able to servive 30 seconds of continous pounding in order for this tactic to be successful, assuming theres only one mage in the group.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

But I am glad they exist otherwise my guild would take all the flak they do, we just would not have to hear BS from their members. As such, the claims made by FoH here represent what I have seen in PoG, vs. Trakanon, in Dragon Necrosis, etc. With only the specific zone being different. I personally feel Verant will make a change to complete heal of some kind, perhaps cutting its casting time in half and making it a half Heal with a HoT component, spells like this are seen in the Velious DD and DoT spells that mages get to have a lower aggro.<P>All in all I really have to wonder what VP is like now with this change. <P>Regardless it does show the same lack of vision change wise that many previous choices have, and it leaves the players with 2 choices, quit playing or adapt. <P>Kylere Ap'Kailere 50th Mage<BR>Kailyre Ap'Kailere 44th Druid<BR>Kailere Drowsbane 55th Paladin(retired)<BR>Member- Celestial Tomb<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062398-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062398.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062398-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062398-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062398-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=062398&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=062398&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
