</FONT><HR>Having another comment by Absor here restores some faith that this thread gets some attention after all. <P>I think you would probably have less complaints if you would indicate whether the issues that you consider not balance related will be also addressed separately.<P>Epic quest: Yes, some quests are probably harder than others, nothing wrong in that. Wizard epic is a scavenging lottery though. And old planes is a really poor selection as it results uber guilds farming for the item while having to step on small guilds trying to enjoy the game. There would be less bullying and bad feelings if the skin was elsewhere, preferably a random time spawn not a weekly one. Other classes get triggered spawns and specific mobs on their quests, we get to kill a weekly spawn everyone else is after as well for 50 times pissing everyone off. Call that a 'quest' ???<P>Velious uber mobs: I fully AGREE that this is the biggest issue. By far the most ridiculous balance issue in the game, but I may be opiniated...<P>Skyfire evac: You do realize that having high risk on this one does mean it NEVER gets used as an evac. I evac to Greater Faydark and port to Dreadlands rather. Currently it is EXCLUSIVELY used for travelling by lazy people who don't want to walk through Burning Woods or find a druid. I never use it, I never seen or heard anyone using it either - the implementation of this evac completely defeats the purpose!<P>Concussion: The quest blows. It is doable post 50 and requires help from other classes. Either the spell should be post 50 or quest should be moved to appropriate zones. Even if it was considered post 50 spell, please then move the CoM part to a zone where post 50 people hunt in. It is very hard to get people come help and be killed by green trash in CoM. They would rather be whacked in a zone they are already hunt in and by at least blue trash. Now it is simply a major pain to work on this quest without any fun, challenging but enjoyable part to it. <P>Balance overall: I would like to see a solution that makes the class description closer to reality. I want to be wanted in a group because of magical damage, not a feeble damage shield. I don't think teleports, evacs or translocate helps me get into groups. They help me get some plat, that's all. Is there really no room for one class specialized in DD, thus having higher damage output (at least compensate for the lack of melee provided by the pets!)?<P>Equipment: The way the equipment has been upgraded has a big role in making DD less and less useful. We have come to a situation in which some melee classes start outdamaging wizards both in long and short term. I would like to see this situation addressed. Adding more wizardly loot that helps us improve our character beyond maxing INT would be appropriate. Currently the caster drops in general seem extremely rare (just look at Sebilis, Chardok or other popular dungeon). Even on the field of DD another class gets much better equipment, just look at JBB. Effects of wizard equipment generally lack comparing even to other pure casters.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There are other balance issues.  Wizards weren't balanced before Kunark came out, they just weren't as bad off at the upper levels.  I'm sorry but its true, we have ALWAYS needed work, and the expansions only have exaggerated the problem.<P>But here is the biggest balance issue:<P>Start weak end up the same as everyone else.  Where's the compensation for that?<P>How bout the compensation for all the weaknesses listed in the previous thread?

</FONT><HR>Absor, dont take this the wrong way, but I feel in your haste to "finish up", the all the class balance issues, in the obvious little amount of time you have given yourself. You are actually doing a bigger dis-service to your customers, then if you would have never opened these threads in the first place.<P>If you open a thread where you want to "talk", about balance issues, then you should have done it one at a time so that you would have the time necessary to "talk" with your customers that have concerns about the class that they wish to play.<P>Its really nobodys fault on this board that many people dont think you read them, because honestly its like talking to a brick wall, and if a intellegent idea that is well though out ever does get posted it is immediately buried under a bunch of trash. So when the only person that actually has the power to do something about it, gets around to reading the posts, many of the really good posts are overlooked.<P>If you want continued feedback from your customers in the future, I think you would be wise to give yourself enough time to, objectively listen to what "everyone" is saying. Out of the Thousands of posts on this topic, over half of them are being posted by the same person over and over again to try to get YOUR attention. If these well thought out posts are not answered, objectively then, people eventually give up, and will start to feel as if nobody cares, and eventually it will grown into a belief of poor customer support.<P>You after all where the one that wanted to "talk" about class balance. The majority of people posting on this board also post on the other boards related to Wizards, and offer the same basic ideas of what they feel would make the class more fun to play. What you have going now is not helping people feel better about there class, it only makes them feel worse, which is magnified by getting ignored on these boards, if its intentional or not it doesnt matter.<P>Personnelly I could care less if it take 2 weeks or 6 months to fix, my class. I know there are problems with it, and I want them fixed. I personnally think the balance issue could be fixed rather easily. However, you need to give yourself more time to address each classes issues individually, instead of crunching everything down two weeks of work. The end result likely will be slot of people not getting what they need, and getting no explantion as to why, or if anything is going to be done about it.<P>I really dont care if you are normally a nice guy, and you are stressed to the max right now. However from the customers perspective of things, It totally looks like a internal problem, of which you can only blame yourself, for not giving yourself enough time to do these "talk: threads right.<P>If you time management was more realistic, you would be less stressed, and if you started addressing peoples concerns on these boards, everyone might learn something including you, and then even your customers would be less stressed, as we put alot of time into these characters, and get very disturded when they are not living up to there glory, due to over-sights.<P>Not meant to flame anyone at Verant or on this board, but I dont think you adding any value to these "talk" threads at all. Your above post, seems to imply this all the more.<P>It would be alot better in my opinion to do one class per week, and post objective replys to customer concerns daily on the same board then to continue doing anything the way it is now.<P>56 Wizard of the Nameless<P>Hope you take this in a constructive matter, as the typical Customer could care less about Verants internal deadlines.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I dont play a wizard, and never will unless they are changed.<P>I think wizards nukes should cost 1/4 or 1/5 what they do now to cast.<P>This would make a wizard a major damage dealer, and not just a stunning nuker that spends all his time OOM.<P>Wizards have no fall back.  Every other caster has a fall back, a pet, a way to slow a target, a way to run from a target, something.  Oh ya wizards can stun.  I don't play a wizard.  I stopped at level 10.  It is the one class that sucks so bad, that even if you want to play it cause you just love wizards, and image that brings to your mind (I am that way with rangers and wizards) after playing them a bit, you figure out.  If I cast much I am dead, if I cast slower I run out of mana and spend half my time milking from the group, and if I cast a little slower so I am not OOM all the time, I dont contribute enough to be worth having in a group.<P>This class is broken the worst, the shaman is playable but broken, as it the ranger, but this class is not trully even functional. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, I know you are getting frustrated reading these threads.  The fact of the matter is Wizards are frustrated also.  This is truely our only form of communication with someone that can actually do something from VI.  That being said, wouldn't you be frustrated typing and retyping the same issues on balance and broken spells over and over again for an entire year and a half.<P>I know you are not the cause of the problem.  I really hope you can be part of the answer.  I personally gave up hope on my wizard.  The class is to flawed and would take a massive overhaul to fix.  (which I doubt VI will put the time into doing)  Not trying to be negative but Wizard have heard for to long that there is no problems and that we are balanced.  However, I think you have sparked a lot of interest from the wizard community for even attempting to look into the problems of the class. This is something that we never got out of any other blue name.<P>PS.

</FONT><HR>Absor!  You stuck you tongue out at me!  Hurmph.  /cry<P>Well, I hope that means you liked my other comments besides the Epic one...  group-based Harvest, resist summons, stun on Al'kabors or same mana eff as Jyll's, min time Enstill will last, etc... I think the most important thing is making us more effective in a group and leave our soloing capabilities as they are - adequate but nowhere near necro.<P>You know what kept me tossing in bed last night?  The fact that there are NO melee proof mobs in Norrath.  Lots of 99% magic resistant mobs, but none that are melee proof.  I'd love to see part of a dungeon, and better yet, mobs interspersed throughout Norrath, that no melee or pet could put a scratch on.  That would help break the tank-cleric-chanter moopoly!  Having the good chance a single mob would come along they can't put a scratch in would make the "NUKER needed for group" a lot more common.  If the mob could not be touched with melee the mob could be an awesome spell caster too and not rely on melee.  Basically melee like I do (not at all).

</FONT><HR>Wizards are one of the best solo classes.  I have solo'd my wizard all over norrath.  It takes about 60% mana to kill most blue mobs I would fight (lvl 53 wiz).

I do not or never will play this game because I can solo well.  I play it because of the grouping factor and being a great solo'r does me no good for getting into a group.

</FONT><HR>I only have a low level (18) wizard but here are the main flaws I see in the wizard class from my low level perspective, looking at the list of spells and listening to friends who play wizards. These are, for the most part, listed in the order of their importance to the wizard class.<P>Portals/Evacs: Portals like cazic have dangerous entry points, portals have bad locations, portals to decent locations come at too high levels.  I can see an argument for having a dangerous portal but wizards are the least defensive class in the game so giving them a dangerous portal is just plain mean.  Compare wizard portals to druid portals and you see quite clearly that wizards get the short end of the stick here, considering that druids get SoW, SoC, and other speed enhancements to make them easily a better travel class I'd have to argue that wizards should get a better portal spell makeup, at earlier levels.  This should include West Commons in their first ring of portals (self, and group) a safer location for the  south part of the old world than cazic, better relocs in Kunark, possibly a location closer to Qeynos/Surefall/Halas to make up for shafting them for so long in this area.  If you want to put in dangerous portals, give some to druids to offsent their ability to travel the world relativly freely compared to any other class.  Wizards seem to get shafted at every turn, even the Dreadlands portal is just further away from anything than the druid portal.<P>Damage spells aka DDs aka nukes:  Wizards should be A-Number One, prime damage dealers at all levels PERIOD.  There should be no level range where a magician, who also has a pet, can do more damage in a shorter time frame, for less mana than a wizard.  I see no need to justify this, it should just be done.<P>Utility spells:  I've always wondered why O'Kiels Radiation was just one spell and never got any upgrades, a line of damage shields (target only and later group) would go a long way in helping the wizard class.  A few more of the group line of resistance buffs (endure fire/cold/poison/disease) look at the relative level of levitate/invis/see invis/endure breath.<P>Fade Line/Root Line:  These need to be re-evaluated for all classes, along with the snare line, as everyone I have ever talked to says the higher level versions are just less effective, more mana intensive, more resistable versions of the lower level spells.<P>Bind Sight Line:  Been said but there needs to be some way to flag the client for more location updates of the target which the caster has bound sight to.  This is a bug for wizards, along with every other class who gets this spell.<P>Worthless AE spells:  Centered around caster AEs are rarely used by a wizard (except to farm green dungeons) since the mission of a wizard in a group is to do the most damage with the least aggro and most wizards try to be as far from melee range as possible.  I have also seen bugs with the Area Effect spells centered around target where they just don't seem to go off.<P>Bolts:  These can't be counted when you evaluate how much damage a wizard does because they are as unreliable as a bow and arrow.  I've seen players, little hills, edge of inclines, foraged food dropped on the ground hinder the path of a bolt (arrows and thrown weapons seem to suffer the same issues.)  Yes I understand there should be a penalty for having a more powerful spell than an appropriate level direct damage spell but the acceptable pathing of these needs to be re-evaluated.<P>Conjuration:  OK so it's a rarely used skill by wizards but how about giving them something that costs less mana than eye of zomm to practice with.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>    About rain spells....I think the idea of adding an extra wave to compensate for pets is a bit odd.  Is it really that hard to code it so that pets are ignored?  Maybe it is.  However, that extra wave will still probably result in wizards not casting rain spells if pets are up since less damage will be done.  You didn't mention (or did I miss it) another key issue with rain spells...the resist rate.  The resist rate is way way too high.  We've been testing it out in the last 2 nights in several dungeons and routinely see 1 to 3 resists on the 3 waves with 0 resists on draughts on green and blue mobs.  That takes away the mana efficiency that makes these spells desireable and compenstates for their huge down sides of the caster being able to be caught in their effect (wish I could resist as well as the mobs), potentially agroing other mobs through the walls ceiling or floor (another issue), and breaking mez of mobs that you thought were out of range of the effect.  Drop the resist rate and hopefully take out pets.  Otherwise they stay mana inefficient dangerous spells that we won't use.<P>About familiars...balance issue?  Well probably not.  All depends on whether you want to make them a part of  the whole question of group friendliness, etc..  Certainly it's possible to make a spell linked to a familiar...e.g. slightly increased mana regeneration (say like a second mana skin so enchanters aren't upset), etc..  Personally, I'd love something small like a black cat or raven (heck use an imp if you don't want to make new art work) that we'd summon between fights that we had to keep safe and which helped the whole group.  Heck...I'd just love to have a cute NPC that said interesting thinks (like Floyd if anyone is old enough to remember Planetfall & Stationfall).  If you want to add a bit more risk to the benefit make it so we lose a bubble of health when our familiar dies.<P>Why do wizards get invis to undead?   I suspect it's because it's fun.  There hasn't been much logic to who gets which invis spells.  Necros and shadowknights have regular invis starting at a low level in addition to invis vs undead.  I suspect it was put in to help them travel through good aligned areas.  Well, wizards without invis to undead usually find themselves slugging their way through a million green undead mobs in some zones only to run out of mana...at that point we either gate if we're lucky or die.  Other classes at the same level either have invis to undead or are easily capable of meleeing them.<P>There is a problem with stuns that needs to be addressed for several classes...several mob types will give you the message that they have been stunned, but there is no effect (and you can get a resist on these mobs so it's not just only one message being given out).  From my experience these are the same mobs that can't be mes'd.  It would really help to get a message back saying that [mob] is immune to  [your stun spell].<P>I personally think it is a balance issue that casters no longer get exp in multi-group hunts.  Even when we outdamage a group with more meleers in it we do not get exp..  Apparently it's due to their ability to taunt.  I've seen this in settings with just 2 groups.  One with casters doing 50-75% of damage and the other with meleers.  The casters managed to get no exp that whole afternoon.<P>I hope that the main focus on balance issues will be whether a particular change will make wizards more desired in groups.  Currently we're about the least wanted class out there.<P>- Balk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>     I carefully read Absor's last post.  After reading his post, I have a better understanding as to why the Wizard class will never be properly balanced.  The changes that really need to be made for us to be balanced are the changes that they are most adamant about not changing.<BR>     I have not decided what I am going to do with this epiphany that I have just had, but I am going to do something.  I feel that I have wasted over 54 days of my life playing a character that is becoming less and less desired, while at the same time becoming less and less useful.  <BR>     I know why everyone that has been contributing to this thread is so upset.  We have grown so attached to the Wizards that we play.  It breaks our heart to see that we will never achieve the stature and power that we were promised.  <BR>     If I continue to play this game, it will not be as a Wizard.  This time it will be a character that others enjoy being around and actually would like to play with.  That is why I started playing Everquest in the first place.<P><BR>Mavrin<BR>Wizard of Erollisi Marr<BR>Moment of Clarity    </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is the last reply made absor"  Absor<BR>Station Member   posted 01-23-2001 06:30 PM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Well, that was a lot of reading. Besides one meeting, all I've had time to do today is read these class threads and write up very long replies. So let's get on with it!<BR>In general there are few 'balance' issues in this thread. There are several problems, but things (even seemingly important ones, like the whole Admiral Akbar line of spells) aren't balance issues. And I want to look at the balance issues first.<P>A bazillion hit points: The biggest balance issue that I see is the problem that we've given the purely mana dependent wizard in Velious. Once the mana is gone and the enemy is only partially wounded, the wizard is no longer contributing to the fight (except that he is meditating in preparation for helping out later). I see this as the single most important issue facing the wizard class as a whole. And, as I'm discovering with most classes, it's mostly a post 50th level issue.<P>I've seen two basic approaches to a solution to this problem. Unfortunately, both are very dramatic (though it may require a dramatic change to rectify this issue). One is simply to increase the wizard's mana reserve, the other is to create a new line of spells that does a percentage of damage based on the current hit points of the target. Honestly, I don't like either one. Raising the mana pool would be a terrific balancing problem. This not only increases the potential damage output of the wizard while he's fighting the bazillion hit point enemy, but at all other times as well. I can't really see this working.<P>I admit that the % damage spell idea is interesting. And it does target the problem a lot more specifically. This also seems like an idea that could cause troublesome balancing issues, but far fewer than the mana pool increase. It would require a ton of work, assuming that this sort of spell is even possible<P>There is a third idea that I have, but I can't tell you about because it is based on things that you folks don't get to know (sorry). But it is not too far from the percentage damage idea anyhow.<P>Regardless, this is the main concern that I have about balancing the wizard class. And it will probably remain at the top of the wizard list.<P>The other more general issue is about the whole level limit cap on wizard (and everyone else's for that matter) damage spells. I can see how this would impact a wizard more than others, since they have little to do when they can't blast things. I'm not sure if this should be changed, but I'll bring it up.<P>With the list below, a + means it's on the list, a  means that it is not on the list, and a ? means that I don't think I understand the problem and need more input.<P>Specific Spells:<P>+ Al'Kabor line of spells: The consensus is that this spell line is far less useful than the parallel line (pun!) of pillar spells. It seems that the benefit if a larger area of affect and a single extra target is not worthy of the increased mana cost. Frankly, it seems that there are no wizards casting this spell in Norrath. Heck if I know how to fix these. I'm against any call to simply remove the spell, that does little to actually help anything. Increasing its radius could be very messy. Adding more targets might be the best solution.<P>+ Flaming Sword of Xuzl: Again, I'm against just eliminating what is already there (keep in mind that ideas like 'take away this spell and give us this one instead' don't really work well). Though I also agree with many of you that wizards shouldn't have pets. I do like the idea of allowing this thing to work sort of more like a DoT (as with the clerical hammer spell). Making it immune to spells and riposte might work to make this spell more useful. In any case, it should be looked at.<P>+ Harvest: The feeling is that this spell doesn't 'ramp up' properly for levels over 50. Some want to see this spell recast faster, and I'll suggest it. But keep in mind that this is, essentially, increasing the wizards mana pool, which is an idea that I am against in general.<P>+ Rain Spells: I agree that we should think about taking pets out of the equation. I'm not convinced that more needs to be done than that. We also might need to look at the resist rates on these spells (in conjunction with everything else). But I was thinking that we should consider increasing the over-all number of waves a bit (I mean, really, like by 1) but leaving pets in the formula. This would increase the relative power of wizards. But that also may not be the best thing to do (since there are people that play magicians too). In general, this series should be looked at.<P>- Okiels Radiation and the other one: Sure, not the greatest spells. But I can't imagine suggesting that they be made better. So let's just leave them as they are.<P>+ Atol's Apectral Shackles: As a level 51 spell, it fizzles too much, reportedly more than Fetter a level 58 spell. I agree that we should review the whole thing with high fizzle rate spells.<P>? Snare/Enstill: It sure does seem odd to suddenly get a group snare Tell me, would you rather have a group or a single target snare in that spell slot?<P>+ Invisibility to Undead: I, honestly, don't know why wizards have this spell. I want to find out why.<P>Teleport Spells:<P>+ West Karana: Move this portal to the other side of the zone. This has all of the technical nightmares that I pointed out before (complete rebuilding of the zone and time to download it). But heck, it's on the list.<P>+ Cazil Thule Gate: Mana of you think this is in too dangerous of a location. I'm not sure that there really should be any promise that the place you end up in should be safe. Use this spell when you know you're gonna die, and any destination is better than where you are. But I also see your point.<P>+ Fade/shadowstep/yonder: These spells have problems going vertically. I'm not sure that this can be fixed, but if it can, it should be.<P>+ Evacs: I agree that it would be nice if Evacs would take link-dead characters. I have no idea if this is possible, but I can certainly ask.<P>+ Evacs and Abscond: I will check into the whole thing about these spells clearing or not clearing aggro lists.<P>+ Abscond: This is another spell that fizzles too frequently.<P>Items:<P>- The Plane of Growth robe: Honestly, I'm fine with longer casting times on free direct damage spells. Even more so if it's a Lure.<P>+ Epic Quest: I'll ask them to review the Cazic skin and the whole difficulty of this quest. But keep in mind that I am in favor of these quests being very hard.<P>+ Concussion spell scroll: This is believed to be too hard to obtain. But, consider that this is a great spell, and having to earn it is a good thing to me. The question is, is it too hard to get.<P>New Spell Ideas:<P>"BLINK (i.e. proc a defensive shadowstep) <BR>Ok, wizards know stuff and we travel. How about a defensive self-only "Blink" spell that predicts the future (of the combat we're in) and procs a shadowstep when the wizard's about to get hit? I'm not sayin it should work flawlessly, but that kind of spell seems to hit 2 of our supposed class-specific strengths (knowledge of the attack coming, and transportation away from the attack) and helps us be a bit less of a liability in groups. Maybe at high levels it could even have mild hate reduction a-la Concussion. Hell, gimme a whole blink line of defensive spells of varying proc frequency and effectiveness. <BR>This might also address the fact that we got no hp/ac and no pet to help with our defense."<P>This is an interesting spell idea that I'll pass on. A 'buff' that basically procs shadowstep when the caster is hit. But only for potential future use, not for any sort of solution to current wizard issues.<P><BR>Wow. One day dedicated to two threads And more to come tomorrow.<P>Thanks for you input. I will certainly be reading this thread and updating my list. I may not post because I'll be posting in other threads. But I will keep reading.<P>Alan  "<P> Does any of this seem like help is on the way?  Not real convincing to me.

</FONT><HR>Wizards talk too much  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  I've been told this by many people, so I'll be brief.<P>The problems in the wizard class are twofold:  <P>a) the problems of EQ balance in general are that melee is greater than nuking in almost every circumstance.  Who else to show it better than the pure spell-damage class?  Why else are enchanters and clerics so important? (to make it a one mob world for the meleers to drop the mobs one by one)<P>b) the other problem with EQ in general is the downtime.  The ports don't help with downtime when dragons and green aggro mobs camp the zone in points for 1/2 of our new world ports.  I like cazic port being dangerous-- but only because South Ro was an option.  There are no options for Cobalt Scar or Wakening Lands or Skyfire.  Except to run.<P>That's it-- solve EQ's magic vs. melee question, and you will have mostly fixed the wizards.  Enable wizard and druid ports to be more numerous and more safe and you will balance class desirability in EQ more.  (who cares about being able to port when you have to run from Dreadlands or Iceclad anyway?)<P>Everything else after that is just gravy (spell effects, faster mana, bigger damage, pets on rain spells)...  you screwed up when you made the melee classes get better and better weapons/armor, and upped mob hitpoints and damage output to compensate-- and didn't consider how easy it is (with aggro coding and limited mana pool) to toss ALL MAGIC except that which supports melee (speed, heals, damage shields, buffs) into a second-class (non-essential) way of dealing damage.<P>I wish I had some quick fix suggestions-- but I honestly don't believe there are any.  I commend you for trying, however-- good luck!<P>Aktar Mythmaker<BR>58 wizard<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Look I'm sure that something like 90% or more of us out there are fare players.hell it could be 98% or 99% but that 1 or 2 precent is still enough for Verant to say "no way" to an incress to the spells, its not that they don't like us or want to see our class unhappy but there idea of "balance" isn't going to let that happen and that's the sad end to it. <P><BR>If you take a look at the spells that were given with the Kunark expansion they were on to something (fast spells with good damage and mana rate, very low resist spells, mana efficient AoE's and so on) but the sad truth is that no matter what we say they will never up the damage of old spells because in there eyes they're as balanced as they can get even if at 44 a Magician's magic based spells does 26 points less damage then our fire-based one at the same level its balanced in there eyes and I guess that's that.<P>If you ask me they should try to revamp the old ones a bit with some non-expansion spells that have the same idea in mind like low resists spells and faster, more mana efficient ones so the people out there that don't have the expansion can get them early on and add a bit more to there groups or even there solo play, I wouldn't say the pre expansion or pre 50 spells are so out of whack that there worthless but they really can use a "fresh coat of paint" so to speak.<P>Again, sorry if the killstealing made anyone mad but it really needed to be addressees in the way Verant sees us and that is a VERY powerful tool that in the wrong hands can cause more misery then help.

</FONT><HR>"1) If you're a post-50 wizard, do you think wizards have more balance problems before or after 50?<P>(I'm inclined to think afterward... I like my damage output compared to meleers and to mob hit points in my current midlevels, and assume it pales only after meleers commonly have weapons of epic and near-epic proportions--but I'm not post-50 so perhaps you'd disagree.)<P>2) If you're not happy with your damage output compared to mob hit points on Velious, are you happier on Kunark? What about in the Old World?" - Muktuk<P>1) After 50. Pre-50, Pre-Kunark I was very happy with my wizard. Certainly there were shortcomings, but I was a decent addition to a group.<P>2) Once again pre-Kunark/Velios (Old World) I didn't think Wizards were that bad off. Take a level 46 wizard hunting in lower guk as an example. The average mob you will encounter is the froglok dar knight, average of 3700 hitpoints. One Conflagration at almost 620 damage is ~1/6 of that frog's HP. Which means in a group of 6, you have done enough damage, assuming the rest of your group does 1/6 damage. But usually you can throw in a second conflag without worry of going OOM. You just took down 1/3 of that mob. Most of the placeholders have 6000-7000hp. Which means a conflag still does 1/10 of that mobs hp, and those mobs are not encountered nearly as often as the lower hp mobs. The froglok king has 7000hp, the arch magi has 6000hp and the lord has 10000hp. These mobs with this much hp are not encountered nearly as often, like I mentioned above. Other classes will also have to exert more mana to kill them, so if you as a wizard cast 4 or more nukes throughout the fight, then you can put a nice dent in their hp. That would be 1/3 of the arch magi's hp, just under 1/3 of the king's hp, and 1/5 of the lord's hp. Once a Wizard receives Ice Comet, he has no problem keeping up with damage dealing in groups.<P>50+ in Kunark though, the average mobs you see in a dungeon such as sebilis, near the entrance have 8000hp. It can be hard to keep up with constant pulls of mobs that have nearly 10000hp, atleast without an enchanter to clarity. As you get deeper in the dungeon, you run in to ilis frogs which have 12000hp and myconids which have 11000-14000hp. When you get into one of these groups, your group can get down there just fine, but a Wizard just can't contribute much to the group. I was in a group last night camping the myconid spore king. We had a 56 warrior, 56 wiz (myself), 55 enchanter, 59 cleric, 58 mage, and a 60 warrior who was tagging along hoping for a cobalt bracer to drop. All of them had several reasons why they were there. I am not going to list them, as anyone 50+ can guess why each class was present. I did an average of 2800hp of damage to each mob, which was 4 draughts. Not too bad you may think. This was using Clarity II and Harvest. However, I didn't nuke like this on every mob. When I got below 1.5 bubs of mana, I'd med back up to 4 bubs mana, only nuking once or so during a fight. I was kind of useless. Any other class would have been much more worthwhile for the hours we were down there. The only thing that made me feel useful was when I translocated one tank, and teleported the rest out so they could go do something else. While it is nice to have that ability, I wish there was a more compelling reason for me to be with that group for 3 hours besides teleporting them out when it was time to go.<P>-Toth, 56th Wizard of Tallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>True Javafiend but when it came to Killstealing there was for a time no rival even the Druids couldn't keep up with us because there spells were still a bit too slow to get the spell in time, when we were done casting one nuke and getting ready for the next they were still waiting for there current spell to end so they could get anothe one off. Maybe that was a sort of "nerf" for that class but i do see where your coming from  they have farely powerful spells at high levels and to be honest they didnt get the name "Secound best nuker" for nothing..well atleast thats the name i've seen floating on my server, can't say the same for everyones out there.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Ok this is not my own ideas but some posted on Everlore. Hope you at least look at them cause some of are good ideas...<P>You know, I have heard a lot of good ideas for balancing the wizard class out a bit. I'm a die-hard wizzy lover, and while it pains me to point this out, wiz's suffer some major problems at critical levels. Against super nasty 100K hp mobs in velious, for example, we can not do too much other than blow off perhaps 5 or 6 K of their hp, if that. Then its back to the books, provided the mob doesn't eat us before then.<BR>The ability to use get less resists is always good, and thats before the lure line of spells. But as far as a complete answer, it falls short of that mark. Heres some ideas I've heard and/or come up with.<P>A) Make Harvest an ability, like Harm Touch or Lay of Hands, that can be practiced at level 34. As your skill in it rises, so does the amount of mana you regain per use, say, perhaps 11 extra mana per level, with 225 mana starting off at 34. Doing the math, that means about 511 mana back per use at level 60. Also cut down the delay from the original time by a quarter. This means more nukes from us, and makes us look like heroes for throwing down that extra ice comet and a lesser spell while everyone else is oom. AND it frees up a spell slot.<BR>B) Critical hits, but spell wise. This lets us do more than the allowed max damage for the spell occasionally, by perhaps 1/3 more the intended damage.<BR>C) I like this one I've heard. Make a spell for the wiz that allows them to power someones weapon by casting the spell on that person to do additional damage against certain mobs, (i.e. extra damage againt frost giants because a weapon has a fire-based enchantment on it.). Make it group only, and the chances of a wiz getting a velious group just went up drastically.<BR>D) This ones sure to make some people scream about class unbalancing, but here it is: Give wiz's a higher skill cap in medding. At higher levels, a mage, enc, or nec has their pet that can keep contributing to the death of a mob, even while the caster goes oom. A wiz does not. So if they get a higher level cap, or at least a faster med time, (like 8 to 10 mana per click as opposed to the 6 it is. I think...), and with the harvest ability, they can contribute more and more to a group than they could ever before. <BR>E) Just make wiz's spells more powerful by an additional 10%. At least this way our nukes aren't doing marginally more than the mages and druids, and at higher levels, makes up a larger force to recon with. And again, to wiz's, mana and nukes are everything. No pets, DoT's, mez's, Feign Death, hp, ac, buffs, LoH, HT, nothing. Just powerful nukes. Improving on that one area slightly isn't asking a whole lot. If you have a 500 dd, make it do 550. 50 more damage can be a lot in the right situations, and again points to our ability to burn a mob down faster, our only innate ability other than porting.<BR>F) I think that group port spells should start at 24, and not 29. Druids can port also, but wiz's are the masters of the planes and can port anywhere druids can, so why not give them a 5 level advantage? After all, wiz's can port, but druids can port and travel in zone faster, (sow and group wolf form). So its not all that much an unbalance.<BR>G) If anyone says anything bad about the above, then the dam is gonna burst for this one. Give wiz's a Fire based or Ice based DoT, as it makes sense if you get burned it going to keep hurting, or if you get your arm frozen solid it'll get worse over time. Yes, wiz's are DD masters, not DoT. But if it was a minor one, like comparing the necro 500dd to their regular DoT's, no one would complain. Plus, again, wiz's get singled out as the int class with totally no pets or DoT's. (rains don't count as true DoT's, although several roots and a rain are a NASTY combo.) And with that said, think that you'll STILL be hurting the mob even though your face is in your spell book, or sitting there, level dependent.<BR>H) I still think that wiz's should get some pointy hat, like a point and a wide brimmed hat thingy thats fairly obtainable at mid levels, is NO DROP, and delivers some decent int/mana stats. Of course, it'd look better on female chars than on males, but then again, Gandalf, (yes, I saw the movie when I was a little kiddie, hehe), looked kinda cool in his wizardly pointed hat. Solution: Give it stats between two items, like a Runed Cowl and a Runed Circlet. This way, its better than wearing the +4 int +4 circlet, gives a little picture unlike the cowl, and is VERY unique.<BR>H) Anyone here remember that old post about wiz's getting a Dragon Form similar to that of druid's wolf form? Need I say more?<BR>Ok, I will. Wiz's should get some sort of form, imho. Nec's can turn into skeles, enc's can turn into anything, druids can turn into wolves and trees....I might be missing some here, but the point is, adding a form like that of an ebon drake and flying around like that would be a VERY unique aspect of the class, with various other upgrade to it like the druids wolf form series goes. (more speed, higher attack, more resists, etc). Just like some of the forms though, it'd be for the cool effect. I know I started my druid with wolf form in mind. Be damned if I ever get it too, hehe. ;-D<BR>I) Individual snares like Bonds of Force, so when I am too close to a group of mobs I don't end up BoF myself. <BR>J) Fix the spell animations and make them more flashy. Wait, nm, just do that with ALL the classes. Ice comet looks just like my blasted Frost Shock.<BR>K) Nec's get robe of enshroudment, mag's get robe of the elements, enc's get incandescent armor, wiz's get.......? I wanna see a wiz only robe or something with its own little special visual.<P><BR>Ok, I'm out of ideas, let me know what you think. Verant will never ever ever ever ever listen to these ideas, so theres no need to flame. Just some food for thought and entertainment. ;-D<P>Lanphear Heartrender, Lords of the Unknown guild pres<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> 3 things that need to be done so we are "ballanced"<P>#1 - Rain (aoe) spells.  Please in the name of god take pc pets out of picture.<P>#2 - Harvest. This needs a upgrade, past level 50 its worthless.<P>#3 - Wizard epic. Take a very hard look at are epic comapred to every other class and tell me we did'nt get screwed. Is it ballanced? NO<P>thanks for your time<BR>Drackos level 55 evoker</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I for one do NOT want a pointy hat; we are already treated like dunces, It's best not to look like one and reaffirm the stereotype.<P>#1 More direct damage for the mana and/or<BR>#2 Better mana regeneration<BR>#3 Concussion Quest Fix<BR>#4 Al'Kaboring spell efficiency<P>All of these have been justified many times by Wizards like Oceanbreeze, Grimstaff and hundreds of others.  <P>Some of you have made it to post 50.  I applaud your perseverance!  Because you have already gone through the mire, it is easy to say that this does not need to be looked at.  Please do not tell/imply Verant can/should ignore the lower to mid-level balancing issues on Wizards!  To say that Wizards ONLY are unbalanced in Velious is to do us and your considerable trials a great disservice. =(<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
