&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Here's my thoughts about a few issues that seem to be keys for people regarding how much us Paladins suck, and my opinions about what our job is in a group:<P>1) We can't taunt as well as warriors.<BR>Of course not!  We're not meant to tank stuff if there's a warrior around!  Why the hell would you want to taunt something off a warrior?  They have more AC and more HP than we do!<P>2) Our healing sucks... it barely makes a warriors hp bar move.<BR>Our healing is not meant to be used on main battle tanks... that's what clerics are for.  We're ok in a pinch, but we're not supposed to replace a "real" healer.<P>3) Some of our skills are totally useless (Disarm and Archery, for instance).<BR>Not entirely true.  Granted, archery is a joke for us... but we can pull with spells so who cares (Cancel Magic is a great pull spell... so is Soothe, oddly enough).<BR>Disarm is another matter, however.  Since getting disarm skill at lv40, I have NEVER, not once, EVER successfully disarmed a mob that would give me xp.  On a good day I can disarm an orc pawn about 1 in 3 attempts.  Seems pretty silly don't it?  But here's what some of you may not know:  Disarm is a great taunt.  Even if it's not successful it taunts almost as much as a successful "taunt" skill use.<P><BR>So here's what I see as a Paladin's true role in a group:<P>We are not meant to heal and defend warriors... they don't need to be defended, and clerics are better healers.  We are meant to protect and heal casters.  No class in the game is as good at doing this as a Paladin.  Warriors can't taunt mobs off casters as fast as we can, and rangers can't heal worth a damn... and monks and rogues are even less useful in any kind of protective roll, so we won't even talk about them.<P>Sure, Lay Hands only heals a fully buffed warrior about half way... they have a ton more hitpoints that we do, why should it be a full heal for them?  But how many casters have you LoH'd that weren't completely healed, even from being unconcious?  None... we have a ton more hp than casters.  And LoH is a great taunt in it's own right... you LoH a 'chanter about to die and suddenly every mob in the room wants to be your best friend.<P>And our heals suck when used on warriors... but Greater Healing is a signifigant portion of a casters life bar.  And we can cast in combat just fine... I regularly get spells off while being whacked by a mob or 2... it's all in where your stats lie.  Dex makes it easier to cast under fire.<P>And we can taunt mobs off casters better than any other class in the game.  Stun + taunt + disarm + bash + attack == mob ignores the nice caster.  Failing that, root it.  There is no better taunt in the game than standing on top of a rooted monster.<P>So in that role, protecting and keeping alive the casters in the group, we do just fine.  Granted, when yer fighting mobs that double and triple attack for 200+ casters don't last long enough for us to help... but when yer fighting stuff like that there should be enough tanks present that casters (unless they are stupid and unload with nukes) should never be high enough on a mobs agro list that they get hit more than once or twice anyway... if they are constantly being attacked, either the tanks or the caster is not doing their job right.<P><BR>Likewise, we are pretty damned good at interrupting mobs that cast... not at 55+ granted, but how many 55+ mobs are there in the game that you fight without an army anyway?  I can't think of that many.<P>We are also excellent between combat healers... Rangers are laughable in this role, and depending on where and what you fight, Paladin's often have mana left over to heal with and save the clerics mana for when it's really needed.<P><BR>So to sum up... I think we could do with some better defensive skills (and higher caps) and some useful disciplines.  We could also use some better and more obtainable gear... our class specific weapons and armor are either rare enough to be almost unobtainable, or impossible to get at a level where they are truly useful (*cough* Ro Armor *cough*).<BR>But whining about how much DW armor sucks so bad?  Puh-leeze... if DW sucked that much, why is EVERY 45+ Paladin on my server wearing the helm and swearing it's the coolest thing they've ever owned?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok I am gong to post a couple more thoughts... so bear with me!<P>1. Everyone agrees paladins as a rule are one of the hardest classes to play. Not for the reasons they should be harder then most classes though! We are supposed to be the Divine Warriors in the game chosen buy our gods for such and given special ability's because of this. Give us some useful spells why not a dd like even if its a once a day dd like lay hands assuming we would have to rest and call on the favor of our god to regain this ability and no this should not be able to be resisted and should go up in damage as we level showing the favor our god has towards us being a loyal servant of them and yes we should have a lot higher resistance to at least disease and poison then other classes to be consistent with all other rpgs and the paladin seen in them<P><BR>2. Yes our ac and defensive capability's need to be raised drastically after all we are all about defense (defense has been addressed)<P>3. yes a warrior should out damage us but not because our damage is bad but because they have the ability to use two one hand slashing swords at once therefore increasing there hit rate on any given mob which also increases the damage you deal but we also should be better then anyone at one hand slash and using a shield<P>4. And lastly as a rule paladins have always had equivalent hps to warriors of the same level in all other rpgs they use the same hit dice as a warrior we need to be able to live up to our image as the ultimate defensive tank hp is part of it paladins should be the last one standing even after casting lay hands to save a friends life there by saving the group let the warriors do the damage and bee the ferocious fighters there supposed to be but let us be the person that guards the group from death the one that sacrifices themselves to save the rest if you have a paladin class it should be that a paladin class not woops i am sorry guys i am out of mana and i am constantly missing oh and by the way my taunt doesn't work so yall are going to die even if I cast lay hands to save one of yall. We should be the ones saying back up heal up a bit I can hold it off so yall can either a get away or  heal up and help finish it off.....<P>fyi to verant i have been playing paladins in rpgs for close to twenty years i would hope i know how to play them by now and no we shouldnt be a fire based dd it should be a god based dd after all we are holy warriors not a half caster as everyone seems to think in truth pallys are not hybrids but a class of there very own and there in lies the problem<P><BR>Silverghost Clouddancer<BR>Paladin of the thirty third season<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Let's say there's a pick-up group.<BR>5 level 59 players.<BR>A warrior,<BR>A cleric,<BR>a paladin<BR>a ranger<BR>an enchanter.<P>Who is buffing the group?<BR>ANS: the cleric.<P>Who is adding secondary buffs?<BR>ANS: the ranger.  Yep, ranger is now better at buffing than the paladin.  Strength of Nature, Call of Earth, (Call of Predator at 60 too).  Even Skin like Nature at 59 (a lvl 49 druid spell) when paladins don't get Resolution until 60 (a lvl 44 cleric spell) even though SLN is arguably better.<P>Note: each and every single buff the Paladin can offer is bettered by somebody else in this group - including Resist Magic - EVEN the new Divine Glory (100hp) - I'd rather have the Ranger's lvl 51 75hp 25atk buff thanks.<P>Who is tanking?<BR>ANS: the warrior.  Obvious reasons.  Even with changes the paladin is still quite inferior tanking-wise.<P>Who is dealing the most damage?<BR>ANS: its a toss-up between the warrior and the ranger.  Ranger wins if he's burning his mana.<P>Who's doing the least damage by far of those doing any damage?<BR>ANS: the paladin<P>Who *might* save someone once every 72 mins?<BR>ANS: the paladin<P>Who's pulling?<BR>ANS: probably the ranger (monk or SK if they were there)<P>Why is the Paladin there?<BR>ANS: because someone of any other class could not be found.  Really.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well,<BR>     The defining moment of my career as a Paladin came today. When told I was going on the Fear Raid tonight, I was informed that I would be the "Token" paladin on the break-in. Seems that with all the Rangers and Clerics going..they didn't really need a Paladin (and why would they?) but they thought it only right that if some armor dropped, that it shouldn't rot.<P>Oh well..at least hopefully I'll get a few nice drops tonight..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Was talken with a ranger friend of both of us 52.<P>Asked her hey whats your ac  unbuffed  she told me then  she fully buffed.  adding about 70ac !<P>I then debuffed  looked at ac with shield i as only 20 or so ac higher, iam in valorium and DW by the way with 6ac rings and 4ac earings.<P>i then buffed up  heh  did around 40ac with Armor of Faith and Valor.<P><BR>Now tell me  since i have NO offense and iam the defensive  hybrid which is fine... why does the OFFENSIVE hybrid buff better then me?   WHy would you take me over the Ranger?   <P>The only reason Paladins are most hurt  as hybrids is because sk's and rangers spells are DD or damage based. When a parent class  Druid or Necro is there   the Hybrids damage is less but there spells still do damage.<P>The Paladin with presence of Parent CLeric  has ALL spells over Riden.  Making only our stuns usbale and again post 50 its rare to hit and post 55 its not happening.<P>Either make ALL pally hp and ac buffs stcak with CLerics yes that would mean at 60  resolution stacking with say cleric heroism.<P>Otherwise we will NEVER be fairly balenced.<P>In a Sense ALL hybrid SPells  stack with there  parent int he fact a DD is a DD and a Dot CAN stack at times.<P>So either we get Uber pally weps or a UBER group defense or we will never be useful beyond filler.<P>All classes ive seen asked for specifically EXCEPT paladins for groups, <P>Its VERY simple to see the problems and since u REFUSE to Nerf warriors u must Buuf paladins and ONLY paladins  otherwise its all in vane. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok Absor, I hope you read this.<BR>Todays patch was great for SKs and Rangers, mediocre for paladins.<P>The casting reduction doesn't effect a single spell in the Paladins lineup.<P>Celestial Cleansing is still inferior to Sup Heal, I'm not even gonna buy it. This spell should have been Remedy.<P>You didn't move Sup Heal, Reso, or Shield of Words down in lvl to use for us.<P>There was no upgrade to Wave of Healing.<P>Recast time on Divine Favour is still way too long, and its ratio is still pretty poor at 1:1<P>Divine Glory and Divine Spirit are still lacking in the hps/ac department.<P>Our stuns still do not work on creatures that are lvl 56 or higher.<P>We still don't have a discipline worth hotkeying.<P>We still don't have a self only buff series that adds hps/ac, I mean cmon all the other hybrids get these kind of self buffs we are the defense hybrid right? Divine Purpose just does not cut it, I'm sorry. DP needs a upgrade for 55+ or we need a new line of self only Hp/AC buffs.<P>I know you say equipment shouldn't be used in balancing, but I think that there is an exception here. The difficulty for pal/ranger/druid to up to standard Bp/Legs is ridiculous.<BR>I think these 3 classes drops on Trak and VS need to be made more common, since we don't have SoV dropping armor.<BR>My guild has a full set of every single class Kunark armor, yet still no Deepwater BP or Legs at all. The only reason we go to kill Trak/VS is fo the rangers/druids/paladins, you know how many Trak BPs we have banked?

</FONT><HR>There are two forms of balance... quantitative and qualitative. I've come to the conclusion that VI is intent on balancing Paladins quantitatively - you throw enough lead on a scale, and it'll eventually weigh as much as a gold bar.<P>We don't need more spells that another class already has. Frankly, as far as I'm concerned, VI could gut our spellbooks, and leave us with our stuns, heals, and anti-undead spells. That at least might allow them the freedom to strengthen us in the area where we really need it- melee, both in terms of taking damage (although I think we're in fairly good shape here, post-patch) and in terms of hitting a creature, and making it notice us. I've seen enough evidence, posted here and by watching my own results in combat, that we are sorely lacking in terms of being able to hit something... never mind what damage we might do if we do manage to connect.<P>There's been lots of talk about new and improved weapons, especially 1HS swords. I'm all for that. However, it has occurred to me that some races "take" to different weaponry. Dwarves, for example, gravitate towards axes and hammers. Why not provide a greater variety of choices, and throw in a few that are specialized for a particular race? Or make the epic look different, depending on the race of the person wielding it (or provide racial epic weapons...).<P>Abosr, what you've implemented is a decent start, but it doesn't nearly address the problems of the Paladin in its entirety.<P>Tamarrion Barithsdotter<BR>Knight of Truth<BR>Paladin of Mithaniel Marr<BR>Champions of Norrath<BR>The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>After today's patch, I am much discouraged. Not a single change will be of any benefit to my lvl 52 Paladin.<P>In the average group I find myself in anymore, not a single spell I have is useful: none. Every spell I have is overwritten by something better from a team member. At that point I am only useful for melee, and guess what—Paladin's aren't very good at it.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>If I was to plea for some basic remedies, they would be:<P>1) Give us the same hit/miss ratio as warriors<BR>2) Give us a few more good 1H weapons, and make them Paladin/SK only weapons, so they do not unbalance the dual wielding classes.<BR>3) Post 50, the most useful healing I perform is on Shamans, while they are cannibalizing in down-time. Once in a while it would be nice to actually feel like I have some relation to my parent class, the clerics.

Please let the mobs be stunnable.<BR>5) Fizzles. Dunno why, but I fizzle A LOT. Spells I've been casting for 20-30 lvs now fizzle as often as the lvl I got them, and perhaps more. With an Evocation skill of 223, my stuns fizzle 2 out of 3 times.

This does not infringe upon a cleric's superiority as prime healer. Above all, it's a game, please help players reduce downtime and get quickly back to PLAYING. If this is not possible, please make the 0% lvl 49 spell so that the corpse is still rezzable within the 3hr window. I find it very disturbing that it is more efficient to wait up to 3 hrs for a rezz, than it is to play for 3 hrs to try to regain the lost xp.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have noticed that when using piercing weapons, it's extremely slow getting skill points. I thought maybe I had to train a few points in it, so I did that at the same time I put points into Taunt. Taunt immediately started increasing, but I haven't seen a single point increase in piercing. I restarted my Paladin and have him up to 6th or 7th level, and my 1HS is already up to 20+, my Sense Heading has gone up to 7. Taunt is 20+. Bash is 10+, but Piercing I believe is still at 3, and hasn't increased. A friend said that Paladins didn't get Piercing at the beginning of the game, but was added later. Was it added with the same kind of chance as Sense Heading of increasing? This might be a bug, and don't know if anyone else has experienced this. Using a Silvery War Axe, I can kill blues, whites, and yellows, but using a Harpoon of the Depths, I have problems killing a blue, and get no skill increases at all. When it does hit, it does good damage, but getting it to hit is the hard part.

</FONT><HR>Thanks Beld, that means alot to me bro.<P>When I said that the new casting time increase didn't effect any paladins spells I was wrong, it does effect our undead DDs... but let me tell you something, there are so few undead creatures in the 54+ game that when you do run across one yer like, "oh dam, wish I had time to mem my undead DD" so thats a moot point too.<P>Lets also take into account that if Flame of Light and Force were longers casts than they are now, they would actually cast faster becuase of this casting upgrade. Applying this upgrade to 3.0 or slower casting spells really hurts us. Force and Flame of Light both are 2.5 cast, if they were 3.0 they would cast at 2.0 at 60. Grr<P>If you are goin to leave paladins in this crappy situation you at least need to give us the cleric Direct Damage spells so we can at least be contributing members in a group.<P>And I had a thought on the lack of availabilty of Pal/Dru/Sk Bp and legs... how about you make a quest so we can take all those Trak BPs that are in our banks and trade them in for Pal/Dru/Rang BPs? Killing a mob like Trak and getting bankable items is just plain stupid.<P>Rathimis Dragonmist "Give me Remedy or give me death"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OK this is the first time I've been motivated enought to post to these boards so please bear with me...<P>I have not read *all* the posts in this section so perhaps I'm repeating something someone already said but... it seems to me that while all the moves being made by Verant so far for paladins are an improvement, the still will not help me get invited into higher level groups or raids.  As has been pointed out, we still don't heal as well as clerics, druids, or shamans, we don't do as much damage as warriors or rangers or monks, and we don't have much to contribute in the buffing catagory either.  I remember the days hanging out in Mistmoore, I would see someone shouting that they needed more in their group- I would send a tell and get no answer.  A few seconds later the same person would shout saying they are looking for a healer or a warrior.  To sum up, we have nothing to contribute that can't be done better by someone else and the only way we are likely to get invited into a group is if it's friends, or they need more bodies and are desperate (I just hit 39 and that helps, with the new heal spell, but I'm told that will change in 10 levels when shamans and druids can outheal me again).  So what do we do?<P>I don't know.  That's what's so frustrating.  I haven't thought of anything.  All I can say is, twinking our buffs to improve them or make them stackable, or improving our defense a bit, or the other moves I've seen Verant make do not seem to me like they will help.<P>There seem to be three types of classes.  First you have warriors and clerics and enchanters... classes people feel a good group *needs.*  Then you have the classes which aren't needed quite as much but are always welcome... druids, shamans, monks, rangers...  We are in a third catagory (and I think SKs and wizzies are too) where it seems to be "yeah, I guess we can invite one, sure."<P>I don't feel like I have to be one of the classes that people *need* to have, but I wish I had something to contribute to a party other than helping get the group exp bonus.  I'm sure it can be done, but how do we find that niche for ourselves that will make us useful in groups and raids, without treading on the toes of other classes...?  That's the challenge, and I'm not sure the right way has been thought of yet.  Lots of talk on things that will help, but not that will break our glass ceiling.<P>Of course, I'm only level 39 so maybe my view is skewed... ; )</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I know I'm on page 7, but I've got new material to add, honest.<P>#####<BR>ITEM: New Discipline Idea.<BR>DESCRIPTION: There is an interesting idea floating around for a discipline that would help make the paladin more useful on raids. It would allow the paladin to target a PC and, for the duration of the discipline, take half of the target’s damage in his stead. <BR>####<P>ACK!!!!    <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/eek.gif">  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/eek.gif">  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/eek.gif">  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/eek.gif">  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/eek.gif"> <P>Please, NO!  When this was floated on one of the earlier threads, someone (I don't remember who, sorry) explained in great detail why it was a BAD idea for an alleged "raid-friendly" discipline.<P>He made a number of good points, but the main one was that just being able to spread the damage around would be a huge yawner for people planning a raid.  In fact, it's usually better to have a single PC soaking up damage, it simplifies the healer's job, AND it's more efficient if the target has the best AC and dodge/parry skills in the group (*cough*Warrior*cough*).<P>"I can get hit more!" is hardly a reason to bring a Paladin along...  Instead bring two Warriors, and let them trade off taking damage -- again, who needs a Paladin?<P>Rather, a GREAT idea on the earlier threads for a raid-friendly discipline seems to have been overlooked, which is some sort of "groupmate enhancer" short-duration buff, which might act like haste on melee classes, and some sort of spellcasting boost for caster classes.  The RP rationale, which would be PERFECTLY in keeping with the very concept of the Paladin, is that the gung-ho Knight in the group is goading his compatriots on to greater effort, spurring them to give their all (and more) to fight evil (or at least the current mob) in service to the Knight's holy cause.<P>THAT (appropriately tuned), would be a real reason for people to want a Paladin along on a raid (similar to the cries of joy when an Enchanter joins and can pass out Clarity, or a Shaman joins and can pass out haste and other effectiveness-enhancing buffs).<P>NOTHING else I can think of that has been suggested would give anyone a good reason to consider a Paladin an equal choice against other classes, without being unbalancing at the same time (e.g., if a Paladin ever had enough damage output to be a tempting groupmate, he'd be cutting into the territory of Warriors and Rogues).<P>A new, "spur the groupmates" spell/discipline (call it "Holy Cause", perhaps, or "Contagious Fanaticism"  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">) WOULD be a new, valuable addition to a group, WITHOUT cutting into any other class's territory.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>#####<BR>ITEM: Holy Forge.<BR>DESCRIPTION: Most paladins are unhappy with this discipline. [snip] It seems like it might be a fair idea to allow them to have critical hits on undead at all times (though perhaps at a lower rate) once they pass the level where they get Holy Forge now. <BR>####<P>Errr, actually, the almost unanimous consensus was not that Paladins should get critical hits on undead "once they pass the level where they get Holy Forge now", it was that Paladins should get critical hits on undead AT ALL LEVELS.<P>Why not?  It's not like there are enough undead around to make this a big change, nor are crits really that much more damage for this to unbalance Paladins in any way, nor does the Warrior's ability to crit EVERYTHING make a huge amount of difference.  Furthermore, it's perfectly appropriate for Paladins to have better abilities when meleeing undead.<P>Why make this a high-level, short-time, long recycle discipline?  Why not just throw Paladins an insignificant bone and give it to them ALL the time?  Surely you're aware of how little different it would actually make overall.  Reserving it only for high levels, and only for short periods, is remarkably miserly.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

In fact, it's a distinct liability to the group, and they know it.<P>We need somewhat improved offense skills (NOT equal to a Warrior), AND better weapon selection -- as others have pointed out, the really decent high-level Paladin weapons are INCREDIBLY rare, due to their low drop rates and/or placement on ultra-uber mobs (while at the same time equivalent or much better weapons for other tank classes practically grow on trees in comparison).<P>And on a related topic, yeah, it'd be GREAT to have better one-handed weapons, so we could actually use shields without having to sacrifice HUGE amounts of damage -- darn it, a Knight SHOULD carry a shield.

</FONT><HR>#####<BR>ITEM: Stunning.<BR>DESCRIPTION: Paladins, like shadow knights, would like to be able to stun more things at higher levels. Perhaps allowing stuns to work on some of the more powerful monsters would not be unbalancing. <BR>#####<P>What's wrong with the idea of allowing stuns to work on *ALL* monsters?  Just make them more likely to be resisted by the higher-end monsters, and far more likely to be resisted on the uber-monsters.<P>But there should always be a CHANCE, both to reduce the insanity of never-can-be-interrupted-ever mobs, and to add some excitement to those encounters ("maybe we'll get lucky and a rare stun will interrupt this mob at *just* the right time!")  And balancing the odds of using stuns on a hard-to-stun mob, versus not even trying and concentrating on damage output, would be yet another strategy choice for a group, always a fun thing.<P>Making certain mobs totally unstunnable was just a lazy way out for Verant, and rather a "cheat" at that.  Give us a CHANCE to have a lucky stun save the day, at least, even if it's a small one.<P>Plus that will be one more thing that would make a group say, "hey, if we brought a Paladin along, it would add a useful ability to the group..."  Right now, when going against a 100% unstunnable mob, they might as well leave the Paladin behind -- and do.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

If they can be stunned they can be taken out by a much smaller group, which is something Verant pointedly tried to avoid with "Large Targets" (hence the Vox and Naggy level cap, etc...).<P>Us being able to stun 55+'ers would be totally unbalancing in favor of players:<P>You begin to cast Divine Light.<BR>Hand of Veeshan is bathed in the power of the gods!<BR>Hand of Veeshan hits YOU for 520 points of damage.<BR>Hand of Veeshan hits YOU for 520 points of damage.<BR>Hand of Veeshan begins to cast a spell.<BR>Hand of Veeshan is prevented from casting by your god!<BR>Hand of Veeshan goes out like a chump!<BR>You have slain Hand of Veeshan!<BR>a Hand of Veeshan's corpse says, 'Damn I was hoping it would take more than 12 of you to kill me!'<BR>Joebob says to the group, 'So we gonna go kill Cazic?  I need his skin for my epic'<BR>Mopsy says to the group, 'yeah but I've got a hockey game to go to in 2 hours so lets make it quick'<BR>Joebob says to the group, 'No problem, he's way easier without his spells, I'll mem the gate to feerot...'<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Something you forgot kommisar is that the mobs will resist.  Sure, if every stun landed you would be able to get a group of paladins and chaincast stun and never take a hit, but that will never happen.  Perhaps mobs after 55 should be stunnable, but their resistance is much higher.  Stunning is virtually the only thing that would make a paladin useful on a raid as the game now stands, and there is no reason why stuns shouldn't be implemented for mobs that are post 55.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>While I congratulate Verant on the recent attempts at class balance, I would like to debate several issues.<P>It's been stated by Verant that the Paladin is the Defensive hybrid, and that the Ranger is the Offensive Hybrid.  I would argue that while this sounds good, the facts prove otherwise.<P>1.  Rangers AC with Kunark armor is only 17 points below ours.<P>2.  Rangers get a complete line of defensive buffs, and frankly some of them are better than ours.  Take SLD and Resolution.  SLD is 59, and Resolution is 60.  SLD is a better spell.<P>3.  COE overwrites and is comparable to Divine Strength, yet DS is a lvl 60 spell, and COE is a level 50 spell.<P>4.  Rangers offense is equal to warriors is Offense and Weapons, yet Paladins are behind warriors in Parry/Dodge/Riposte.  In fact our Parry/Dodge/Riposte is still 12% less than the Warriors.  You raised ALL of the offensive weapon skills of rangers, yet didn't raise the defensive skills Parry/Dodge/Riposte of the paladin.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Could you move Sup Healing down to 55 or 53? Right now our new heal spells come at: 9, 15, 30, 39, 57, 59..... see those last two at the end? thats a little too soon together, moving the 57 to mid to lower 50's would be a wise choise... just food for thought</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>We would like some words Absor, alot of us are hinging on this so called balancing so we will know if its time to hang up our paladins or not. And as it is now, I see no reason to play a paladin over 55 =/<P>Paladins are still caught in the badlands of not being able to do anything well enough, we are so poor at the things we CAN do that we might as well not even do them.<P>Paladins need either thier defensive power, or thier offensive power upped. Its up to you on which direction to take us. As you can see from my posts about suggested spell changes, I would rather you take us the defensive route.<BR>But if you won't take us the defensive route, then yer gonna have to add in the clerical DD spells to our lineup so we can at least make SOME contribution to a group.<P>I hate how my paladin is the only class in EQ that you will never see a /ooc or /shout or /guild message asking one to group. I have seen this week a call for EVERY class in EQ to come group, EXCEPT a paladin. And lets face it, who can blame them?<P>Recently a 60 ranger friend of mine was playing main healer for a group in Velk Lab. How? Well he had a Mage mod rodding him, he had Choloro and a Fungi Tunic on. So... in that situation the ranger is a better main healing choice than a paladin becuase he has Chloro. /sigh<P>Lets look at what all ranger brings to a group here. More damage than a warrior, the same life saving healing ability as a paladin, marginal tanking ablity if properly equipped, snare, better buffs than most shamans and definitly better than paladins, and also they can track rare spawns for the group.<P>Paladins bring... marginal tanking ability (sufficient depending on the area), stuns (don't work on 56+ creatures), 100-200 hps per group member (ranger can also do this), life saving heals for when the chit hits the fan (rangers cover this too).<P>EQ is a game about killing stuff. The faster you kill stuff the more xp/loot you get. You don't get xp/loot for making the fights last longer or dragging out. Being defensive is redundant if you defensive isn't enough to actually be used.<BR>So how would buffing the healing abilities of paladins up allow groups to kill stuff faster? Well lets see, if paladins healing power was upped we would free up the backup healing spot for a damage dealer spot.<P>I'm not asking for paladins to made gods. If I want to play a god I go play my ranger (they can solo all the way to 60 and add a hell of alot more to a group than I do as my paladin)<P>I just DO NOT want paladins to be left as the ONLY class in EQ that isn't called for to be a group. You WILL see /ooc, /shout, /guild message asking for EVERY SINGLE class except paladin. Paladins are a fill in class right now, they are the class you take when you cannot find anyone else. And that is truely wrong.<P>Now some numbers for you on Remedy.<BR>Sup Heal does 2.4 hps per 1 mana<BR>Remedy does 2.5 hps per 1 mana<P>We need this spell Absor, we DO NOT need Celestial Cleansing. Celestial Cleansing is a WASTE of pp and a spell slot.<P>I'm gonna keep posting till you say yer done with this, and I hope by then my ranger is lvl 50 so I can just quit playing my paladin cuz I guess yer not serious about balancing the paladin class.<P>I say the above becuase of the token bone we were thrown in the patch yesterday. Well bro, that bone wasn't big enough.<P>Rathimis Dragonmist, 56 Knight<BR>Shoikan Grove, 30 Ranger<BR>Solanthis Dragonmist, 35 Klerik<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
