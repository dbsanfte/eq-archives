</FONT><HR>Wayward using charmed NPCs may cause xp lose in PvP when charm breaks. Not that I really care since I preffer to play in the hours when moms and pops put all the Ralos GMs to bed, but you probably would. And for some reason I don't feel like answering people who claim that unrooted/unstuned melee is helpless against 4.5sec delay nukes. Honestly, I just want root back. It wasn't anywhere near being reliable before. Why nerf it even further? What about hybrids with share/root/darkness? Don't they get unfair advantage now that these spells don't break for them but break from DD spells? Where do all these continous PvP nerfs are comming from? Is someone from VI actualy tring to play on RZ and is getting ganked or something? </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Personally, I am really enjoying reading the *****es and moans from Caster_Gank_Powerleveler_0129 about melees (and SKs in particular) becoming a viable PVP opponents. <P>Folks, in the general theme of fantasy RPG, wizards, mages, necros and other pure casters have historically been weak as hell in the early stages of character development. In EQ, this simply isn't so. Sure, you are susceptible to melee mobs. But in this game, who levels the fastest and easiest? Pure casters soloing (if I had 5 plat for every fahqing necro that wanted me to run 10 zones to rez their solo ass...) SKs and other melees have been SHAFTED until Kunark was released. Now the tables have turned, and all the Dumbasses_0x are getting whiny.

</FONT><HR>Thundolfe, yes 3 draughts killed me which means I didn't resist anything, but that just happens sometimes.<P>Sweyn Sweyn Sweyn...Here are some basic facts you don't seem to know about. The things that determine if a caster will channel or not are the level of his opponent, the level of spell used and his channeling skill. If you as a lvl 60 melee would stand toe to toe with a lvl 52 wiz casting lure of frost there is very little chance that he could actually channel it. Now, if he wanted to gate he would probably make it since it's a lvl 4 spell. <P>Saying a necro can stand still and life tap a melee to death with his 'amazing post 50 channeling skill' just show you don't know what you're talking about.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm with you 100% Bein.  This is the exact reason I'm quitting Tallon Zek to go to Rallos.  Everywhere I turn there are lameo twinks with amazing resists and great weapon, they tear everything up.  I always have been and always will be a caster, and I'll never play on a blue server.  The point here isn't that casters can't "gank" anymore, its that they can't even win even fights against someone using good resist gear (Blue Diamonds, /em shudder.) and a fast weapon.  At high levels very few spells stick, and those that do can be pumiced.  The funniest part is that some melees are still asking for the pumice nerf to be removed.  LOL  Why don't you just delete all caster classes on pvp servers, or turn us into monks and shadowknights.  I hope to God that on Rallos I can at least fight pvp the old way, before 150 MR because everyone is too afraid to wear very good gear.  Goodbye Tallon Zek, Velious gear destroys casters in pvp, though I loved your level limit I hate your twinks.  Rallos is my last hope on this game, and if they make it coin-only I'll cancel my account.  Not because I want to gank for items, but because I can't stand all these twinks and the unfair resist gear that melees get these days.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

It just so happens that a large percentage of droods and necros are usually played by such dumbasses.  Besides, necromancers are the least affected by the blue diamond jewelry implementation..

</FONT><HR>Ok, let me put it this way, this post isn't about your relationship to necros, it's about the balance between melees and casters.<P>Of course mages and wizard will have a harder time after this, but necros and shamans even more since it used to be very hard to get high resists all across the board and people often had high mr/cr/fr. Now they will have high dr/pr as well. You don't have to be very clever to realize this.<P>Also, an experienced wizard almost exclusively use lures in PvP and therefore this won’t effect them to the same extent. The only time you use other spells is when you fight someone several levels below you.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Bein, I really mean no disrespect to you or your gripe.  However, I do feel that your gripe is based on the fear of losing supremacy in PVP because of the present imbalance.  EQ PVP is imbalanced because of a severe neglect of quality assurance by the design team.  It never has been balanced, never will it be balanced.  However, since the expansions the playing field is a bit more level that it was before.<P>As a cleric, I really have disdain for the current system.  Until about level 40 or so, when people started getting really high Magic Resistance, clerics were formidible PVP opponents.  Now, my spells bounce off anyone with 120+ MR (with the occasional lucky roll that hits for full damage).  The same goes for enchanters.  People will often counter with "oh, but your healing power is your class defining ability and thats your strength in PVP".. Well, thats a bunch of crap.  Consider Shamans, Necros, Druids.  All have incredibly superior offensive capacity, yet are imbued with healing capacity that is MORE THAN ADEQUATE for PVP encounters.  Until clerics got the spell Remedy, our PVP healing was basically equal to that of those classes, save necromancers, whose lifetapping not only SELF-HEALS but also hurts their opponents.<P>Now basically your gripe is that a very small percentage of the PVP population (50+ characters with FULL blue diamond resist gear) will have uber resists.  SO BE IT.. I have been on this server since day one, have been an officer of one of the most powerful guilds on the server for over a year, been level 50+ for over a year, and guess what?? I have ONE FRIGGIN diamond ring.  Do you know how long its going to take to get a full set of blue diamond jewelry?  You act like that by next week everyone 50+ will have full blue diamond gear.  Its simply not so.  Maybe in four months, significant percentages of the 50+ population will have a few pieces.  Do you know who will have it first?? PET CLASSES AND PURE CASTERS, because they, in general, have the biggest bank accounts/extra gear.  Forget clerics and tanks, because generally they represent the poorest of the EQ populations (cept Bolas, who sells retail and buys/trades at lower than wholesale value).  <P>I find your gripe to be without practical merit.  Perhaps I might change my opinion in the future based on the actual effect and not some paranoid selfish fear of the implementation.<P>Tael Elamshinae<BR>56th Templar of Xanit K'Ven<BR>Vallon Zek<P>BTW Bein, who is your character on VZ?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Tael, the PvP servers have MANY high level players (same situation on blue servers) and the numbers are increasing, that's why Verant focused on high-level mobs when they created Velious. <P>Also, high-end jewellery isn't that hard to find anymore. Before Kunark the only places you could find them were the planes (well that lizzy in OoT as well), but now things have changed. In Sebilis diamonds drop frequently for instance and with the raised jewellery skill rings aren't as hard to make. I am not sure exactly how rare blue diamonds are, but from what I've seen so far they aren't that hard to find either. People seemed to have plenty of them when all they were good for was smithing.<P>Of course everyone isn't going to have a full set of blue diamond armour next week, but that's not the point. The fact that melee CAN (and will) make themselves almost invulnerable to many types of spells is what matters. It shouldn't be possible.<P>My main is a 59 wizard and I rarely use spells like snare, stuns and even draughts in PvP, they get resisted too much, (while I admit a well timed tear spell can do alot of damage) so I guess this will have a very small impact on me personally. They won't resist my lures anyway, but this trend to weaken the casters needs to stop. With Kunark they evened out and even made melees more powerful then casters and now with Velious and the new jewellery it continues.<P>Why did we nerf spell damage to 66% again? I can’t really remember…<P>(Btw, I haven’t played on Vallon in a while…)<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hate to break it to you Lord Zent, but you missed your chance.  PK guilds like Terrorizors of Norratha have found a nasty little trick.<P>They PL a melee to level 30 then DE-level down to 15.  They still have level 30 skills/abilities in a level 15 world and are almost unstoppable without higher level help. <P>Coin only on Rallos would fix some things but break others...anyone noticing a declining enchanter population on PvP teams?  Enchanters are crippled in PvP with coin only.<P>I have long been an advocate of coin only loot, but I have also said it was NOT a fix...just an improvement.<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'd say anyone who is masochistic enough to level to 30 and then to downlevel back to 15 should not be messed with by anyone verant included. These are abuses, they have nothing to do with balance. The whole issue with PvP balance is that VI people always try to balance PvP with a single/global change instead of looking at PvP situation level by level. Well, not level by level but at least look at every 20 levels or so. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049517-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049517.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=049517&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=049517&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
