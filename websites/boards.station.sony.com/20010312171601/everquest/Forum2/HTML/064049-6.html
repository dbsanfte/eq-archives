</FONT><HR>&gt;We're not hiring fourteen new people to do this. Our dev team is too busy (as they should be). It's my job to try to be those fourteen people. And I can do it, I just can't do it as fast as fourteen people can.&lt;<P>You as one person CANNOT possibly sort out the individual issues for all 14 classes.  Not in a year, not in 5 years. For Verant to try and have one person try to understand the issue which face certain classes is crazy.  I being a shaman did not pay much attention to the other class talks. I read completetly through every single post that was made by the player base.  Over half of those posts addressed issues which IMHO did not need to be fixed. In fact a lot of these posts were poorly written, not understandable, addressed things that didnot/couldnot be fixed.<P>Correct me if im wrong but it is your job to sort the good posts from the bad, the fixable things from the unfixable.  And it is your job to idenify what the shaman community wants for their class post 50.  <P>To understand what a class wants post 50 you CANNOT rely on Everquest forums alone, their is an absence of important information...lack of playing experiance.  To understand what they want you need to do some reasearch, lurk in other forums where many many respected memebrs post, play the class.  <P>If you can do this FOR ALL 14 classes then my friend my hat if off to you. <P>From my perspective you try your best, but undoubtedly you have deadlines, just like the rest of us.  If you don't great.  But what i have gathered from your class talk items lists is you are just "skimming the surface" of the class.  Making cosmetic changes to every class.<P>I think that this community wants to here abotu things being considered for our class.  We want updates.  We would liek to know what the design team is considering.  What they may be getting or taking away from a respective class.  This would be the role from one of the 14 people for each class.<P>Say hypotheitcally you UNDERSTAND deeply what every class wants and their function soloing/grouped/raiding.  HUGE task right there in itself.  Can you after presenting ideas to the design team keep EVERY CLASS updated in what they are considering.<P>Time to bring in an example....ignore this if you pls...it is a biased responce much liek euroeq's necro talk.<P>Playing a shaman they tyeam has done A lot of stuff to improve our class.  However a few things have been ignored that we have presented to you.  ONE OF THE most desired things the high lvl shaman community wants is a "lure based slow."  We dont even know if you have gotten the request for it.  I would give away my left shoe if someone was there tyo say...<P>"Shamans:  i presented your idea to the team.  Keep in mind it is a huge change and would effect the game dramatically.  I will keep you posted on what they say about it.  <P>Thanx <BR>Shaman team design Advocate"<P>I WOULD love for someone to be able to do that for my class.  Im sure every single class woudl also.<P>Basically im saying this<P>1) You say that you can funtion as 14 people..It will just take considerably longer.<BR> <BR>My main 2 points are..<BR>1) you cannot even possibly funtion as 14 people to understand each and every class.  I dont even thing 1 that hasn;t played the class AT LEAST 30 or so levels could be an advocate for the class.  There is just too much informating to sort out<P>2) Even if you could understand all the issues....you as 1 person cannot keep us posted about what is happening for our class.<P>Thank-you for replying<BR>regards,<P>chachikoala<P>Note: would love to see a response to this post and Vayanla posts.  Would make my days that much brighter.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Of course, I don't agree with a word you said in defence of the present lack of customer service and communication. Take tonight for example, there are loads of UK players on the chat server being dumped from the game, and a GM announces once in 20 minutes that there is a known problem which Ops are looking into - why not put that on the banner? Simple, communicate!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Class advocates ARE needed Absor!<P>Frankly I'm shocked to learn that Verant doesn't have this sort of system already in place. Sure you may have staff playing on live servers, but is each class representated by those staff members? And what levels have been attained? And how much out-of-game 'tinkering' has been done to each of these characters?<P>As much as I applaud your efforts in trying to understand each of the classes in EQ, its far too big a job for one person! And for the shadowknights its going hopelessly awry, especially when you are trying to turn us into something we are not! Dragging us kicking and screaming into a defensive role when all shadowknights seem to see themselves as evil knights dealing out pain and death via spells and melee.<P>I know the shadowknight class talk is not working, neither is the paladin one, nor do I expect others are as well. It's not your fault Absor, but I lay the fault directly at Verant's door by assuming ONE person can understand the totality and nuances of every class in EQ, when its clear that advocacy is the ONLY solution.<P>Tryst, ex-Reaveress<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan,<P>Thanks for the response; I feel the need to rebutt some of your comments, but am too tired to do it at present.<P>That said, I will put this out there.  I never suggested hiring 14 people; that would be insane!  In fact, I suggested that existing Verant employees be tasked as these advocates.  They could be GMs, Dev folks, Brad (for rangers no doubt), the secretary...anyone.  Heck you could make in voluntary; I bet folks would line up for the opportunity.  My gosh, it's not like it would take a whole lot of time.<P>If you don't like any of those ideas, why not ask some of your long standing Guides to play the role.  Interview them to make sure they can be a class advocate while being mature enough to take overall game health into account.<P>Anyway..bottom line is that you focused on this one aspect, proceeded from the false assumption that 14 people would have to be hired, and then dismissed it.  If the IDEA has merit...then we can work around the particulars.<P>Finally...bud...take a look in the mirror.  There is no way you can represent all 14 classes equally and passionately.  You'd kill yourself trying.  Also, you will have inherent biases; you have already expressed them on numerous occassions.  Not throwing stones...we all have them; that's why it should not fall to just one person to bring the ideas in for tuning.<P>I know from the Necromancer's perspective, that there are easily 25% of our ideas missing from your list.  They were not dismissed, they simply fell throught the cracks.<P>I more coherent rebuttal to follow...<P>again...thank you for your response.  I hope you noticed that I did say that the Talk threads was a good idea...I gave you the Kudos ;-)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor with all do respect your not doing a good job as far as the Talk Threads are concerned.You may ask what evidence I have of that.1.Im your costumer and from what I've expirenced first hand<BR>I deem it to be less the satisfactory.2 If you would do more then skim the current posts you would see people are unhappy with your lack of communication and follow through.<BR> You are one man without full knowledge of the 14 classes and biased&lt;sp&gt;to boot. As stated above that natural.<BR> NO you can't do the job as it needs doing you have proven that already.No one person could.<BR> I also found your response to be very defensive and "I"oriented.This again seems to procreate the image of "its OUR game and you know nothings are aren't gonna hurt it"<BR> Your fall back answer seemd to be "I don't see it"or "I don't agree" Well we the customers all couple hunderd that responed to this post DO see it.If you read this whole post you'd see that very few people disagree with EuroEQ and if there are a couple hunderd that agree there are darn sure more.

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I appreciate the post and it is always good to see a response to such a core issue, but I disagree with much of what you said.   <P><BR>&gt;"But I would argue that their reactions have little to do with customer service, and everything to do with the kind of customers they are"<P>I don't feel you are taking responsibility for the Verant's actions and lack of action.  The lack of communication and the number of 'What the hell were they thinking' changes made to the game will force me to leave, even though the majority of the game is great and I have invested so much time in it.  It is the failings in Verant's CS and in the attitude of management that will be the prime reasons for my departure.<P><BR>&gt;&gt;I think you are doing a terrible job of communicating with your customers<BR>&gt;I don't see that myself<P>Ok.  Alan, you started a thread on PvP issues 3 weeks ago.  There were about 30 pages of responses from players, yet no effort at all from Verant to even reassure players that they had been read, that anything might be done, that players should think this time anything would be different than the last time Zek players had their chains jerked by Verant.  That is terrible communication.  Give us a hint, give us a clue, throw us a frickin bone.<P>CH is another good example.  Verant decided to make a poorly thought out change to the live servers with little to no interaction with players regarding the matter.  The change has been tweaked to make it not such a poor design decision, but after how many character deaths?  Again - very poor communication on this one.<P>etc. etc. etc. etc.<P><BR>&gt;And to insist that they spend their work time becoming activists for a certain class is rather silly. I think they should be developing content myself.<P>Well, if they are developing the content in ignorance of the issues AS SEEN BY THE PLAYERS, that might explain some of the decisions reached.  Not to harsh on those making changes, but I often have to wonder who made some of these decisions - and why didn't any one tell them it was not well thought out?  Are your average employees afraid to speak against the vision? Is anyone under the impression that developers intimately familiar with the game mechanics are objective enough to make tough balancing decisions?  I would think that failing in that is clear. <P>You can argue all you want that Verant understands it's own game and will do what it must to maintain the integrity and challenge of that game, but try to see the point that EQ is actually a service, and in that you would do well to remember at least a few of the rules learned from the service industry regarding how important your customers perceptions are.  Verant has been fortunate to have such a lead over their competition, but the landscape will change soon enough and Verant would be wise to re-evaluate the way in which they dictate the changes to the service they provide.<P><BR>&gt;And yet, you clearly do not see me as such. (player advocate)<P>Well, I think this is in large part due to the lack of communication.  I do not feel one person can handle this job, and it seems that Verant does not 'get it' enough to add more people.  I repeat - Service Industry. <P><BR>&gt;Again, I do that (respond to issues). It's just not happening as fast as you'd like.<P>If you are not able to respond in a timely manner, you are not meeting your obligations.  Why is that hard to understand?  What expectations has Verant placed on response time?  What are you using to measure your response time?  Is there ANY effort to track response time?  To even track responses at all?<P><BR>&gt;Nothing will get people more upset than missing a deadline.<P>I can think of one thing - having an issue ignored with not a single word of what to expect being given by the service provider.  Total silence is actually worse than missing a date.  You should know this Absor.  If a player encounters a blatant flaw in the game that diminishes their enjoyment, and: they are told by in-game CS that it is not a bug, they get NO response on the message boards, their '/bug' reports are sent into a black hole, and 'eqmail@verant.com' generates no response,  I have a hard time believing this is better than having to accept a delay in a scheduled fix.  As someone that has dealt with a few 'we refuse to even talk about it' flaws, I can assure you my patience is far greater when it there is even the appearance that Verant gives a rat's ass.  I know how loud folks can get when you miss a deadline, but those storms pass quickly.<P><BR>&gt;There is no timeline about your class that you do not already know about. <P>I think what you mean is 'no time line that _I_ do not know about'.  I am not aware of any timeline for any of the classes I play.  I read the boards often, but to be honest, a single post buried in the midst of so many threads/messages will not be read by as many people as you might expect, even when clearly labeled.  To use the message boards to communicate information this important to customers is again a sign of poor communication.  <P>Remember the 'In Development' section of EQ's website? (can't find it now, assume it was removed due to lack of interest in outdated info) It wouldn't get touched for months at a time by Verant - how useful do you think customers found that to be?  If Verant made an effort to have TIMELY relevant information on their website explaining what changes/fixes were coming up, even without specific dates, it would go a long way towards improving communication.  Instead of making an effort to handle communications correctly, I get the sense that Verant would rather cut off communications.  IMO - huge mistake.<P><BR>Overall, I don't think Verant gets it, and I don't know if I have any hope that they will get it before it is too late.  From reading the boards and talking to folks in-game, many customers feel that they are not respected and are treated like the enemy - not to be trusted, not to be given ANY information unless absolutely needed.  There is an adversarial relationship between Verant and it's customers with guides caught in the middle.  I think Verant is in for a big surprise a few months down the road if they continue to proclaim that all is double plus good without really listening to what is being said.<P>It is our perception that the communication is very poor. Poor communication shows either a lack of respect for players or a lack of capability on the part of Verant's management, either way - it will make it easier for players to leave.<P>Take our word for it, or be left wondering where we all went.  Your choice.<P>-tera<BR>one of many Rallos players that feels Verant (and Brad personally) gave us the royal shaft. Thus the bitter overtone.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You know, speaking of customer service...you, Absor, are a form of customer service to us, by responding to our concerns and notifying us of changes etc...<P>I have played this game since release, and the one truly demoralizing and depressing thing I find from EQ, which makes me seriously want to just give up sometimes, is not so much all the nerfs, bad ideas, and extensive untested "additions" to the game, but rather the comments made in response to the customers on this forum, and near total disregard for their concerns raised. <P>You are right, we are wrong..I am living to accept that now..you know whats best for us. Why even bother letting the users post on this message forum? It would save us the time we waste to even type them out, and save you the time it takes to respond.<P>I just can't remember the last time a post was made by anyone from Verant, sans maybe the tradeskill ones, that made me happy and excited to log in and play your game.<P>The original post on this thread, through my interpretation &lt;maybe I am wrong&gt;, was basically stating that Verant has poor Customer Service, and offered a suggestion to help improve. Your response, &lt;I am surprised you responded, so many GOOD threads get passed on&gt; in my opinion was a good example of a portion of that bad customer service. I remember when you first got hired, your original post stating your concerns had me a bit hopefull. The class threads seemed like a great thing, but those hopes in all honesty for me have died.<P>Your response, as soo many responses seem to be from Verant, is the same "We know whats best for you" kind of reply.

</FONT><HR>The job of being able to filter out the noise from the signal in the class balance talks is impossible for one person. Without a detailed understanding of the place and abilities of each class, and the items and gear, and each zone, and how they function in different group make ups, and of the effects of each spell they can cast, and ... well, you get the idea. Often things that look good on paper break down fast in the world of EQ. You probably know this too well.<P>Without the intimate knowledge of each class your filtering ability is flawed. In talking about class balance, when you ask yourself; "Which of these 4,900 ideas has merit?" (7 topic splits at 7 pages a topic at 10 ideas a page), how do you decide which ideas have merit and which do not? Add to that 14 classes and you have 69,000 ideas to judge. If one person spends 1 minute on each idea, that is 47 days to look, read, and think about them all, assuming they didn't sleep. There is no way that one person, no matter who he is, can do this job.

</FONT><HR>Please ignore the order of magnitude error, 7x7x10 = 490, not 4900. Total reading, thinking time = 4.7 days, not 47. What a difference a day makes. Anyway, I'll substitute a few examples for the mathematical argument. Class balance for SK's action list included SKs getting Grim Aura. Grim Aura is already available to SKs by use of an item found off a lvl 30 mob. Many people asked for Voice Graft (this is a balance issue?). Voice Graft is already available to SKs through use of an item. Anyone who wanted those abilities already had them at their disposal.<P>Two brief examples, anyone can probably cite ten more. The point still remains that no one person can possibly hope to accurately understand all the issues that pertain to each class, let alone all 14 classes, or all the situations that these classes face when combined with a combination of 5 other, or 30 other people with thousands of items and spell effects.<P>Did you know that the Shaman epic spear effect will only stack with the Necro spell Heart Flutter if the spear effect is cast first?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I do realize my post will probably not even be read by the vast majority of posters here intent on proving their own point of view. In the end, will what I say matter to someone who disagrees with me? Let's face it, humanity nature is such that *my* point of view is more valid than *your* point of view.<P>How does this relate? In the course of a day, how many threads get started here? How many say inherently the same thing. How many say the *exact* opposite? Has Verant done a poor job of customer relations if, of the thousand threads started, they respond to ten? What if, instead of taking the time, spending an hour on each post, Absor or whomever answers 50 in lesser detail?<P>Perhaps one person likes this idea. Another hates it.<P>Who is right?<P>I think Shamans should get Superior Healing at level 44. You think Clerics should be superior (sorry for the pun) healers at all levels, and other healing classes should get Superior Healing at level 54.<P>Who is right?<P>And if Verant decides to make Superior Healing a level 44 Shaman spell, haven't they just betrayed your expectations by fulfilling mine?<P>All I'm saying is look beyond yourselves. Sure, there are things wrong with EQ. And I'm not saying you should ignore and accept these faults. But DON'T assume that just because you hold one opinion that it is correct. EuroEQ thinks Verant customer service is the worst he's ever seen. I think that for $10 a month, I'm not expecting them to jump when I snap my fingers and say "do this because I'm a customer".<P>It's a game. I enjoy playing it. When the enjoyment stops, I'll stop playing. If I get bored with my class, I'll start another, or load up The Longest Journey or even Sam & Max and enjoy another type of experience. One thing I will NOT do is become unduly stressed because my virtual avatar is not as uber as he could be, not as useful in groups as the next guy, not as strong as a warrior, or fearsome as a Shadowknight, or wily as a Rogue, or whatever. I'll enjoy Everquest for what it is. A damn fine game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ah to cut and paste, let me follow up on a few of your "points" Alan if I may.<P>1.<BR>-----------------<BR>&gt;"Here is my hypothesis. Few accounts are truly canceled. Many are either sold on Ebay or absorbed into a guild. I know the guild with whom I play is supporting at least 1/2 dozen "canceled" accounts since they provide good utility in terms of "porting", "resurrections," "mez-on-demand," etc."&lt; <P>Again, such things are against the UELA (I think that's the acronym). <BR>------------------------<BR>Selling an account on EBAY, others making money off your game....THAT is agaist the UELA.  Handing my account, never to be used again, off to my roommate and he starts paying the $10 a month is not.....if it is....well, that is just a really ****ty thing to do and damned greedy.  That would be like Nike telling me I can't give my kids shoes to another kid when mine grows out of them.<P>2.<BR>---------------------<BR>&gt;"Many people who play your game are, quite frankly, addicted. I do not disparage them but this subset of your customer-base is largely unaffected by poor customer service. They will argue and complain, but do little else. However, when a suitable alternative to your product is available, they will likely shift their addiction in that direction. What about Ashron's call? Quite frankly, that game, from what I hear, doesn't hold a candle to what EQ was (pre expansions) It just wasn't good enough to peel away your customer base."&lt; <P><BR>Fair enough. I'll accept that there are customers (and not just customers of Verant, but just customers in general) that will be satisfied with very little customer service. I will also concede that there are a group of players that have already reached the end of their time with our game and will move on when a suitable alternative comes along. But I would argue that their reactions have little to do with customer service, and everything to do with the kind of customers they are (neither good nor bad, just their nature). Some people will move on to the next best thing regardless of what we do, and others have played themselves out on EverQuest. We do our best to retain these people, obviously.<BR>----------------------<BR>I'm not really sure if you are denying the addiction or just blew it off.  If I was not addicted I sure as heck would not still be here.  Frankly everybody I personally know who play this game, save maybe one, is addicted and has admitted as much.<P>3.<BR>----------------------<BR>&gt;I think you are doing a terrible job of communicating with your customers. I am a customer and that is my perception. Many here seem to have the same perception. Perceptions of one's customers is reality...trust me it is. Your customers feel you are adversarial with them. They believe that you think they will destroy "your" game with their unbalanced ideas. Perhaps you are right...but they (we) are the customers so how do you communicate your concerns while answering ours."&lt; <P><BR>I'll have to take your word on that. I don't see that myself, but then again I work here. But I talk to customers a lot, and I get a different feeling about it. <BR>----------------------<BR>No Alan, you have to take OUR word for it, not just hers, VERANT stinks at customer service and that is not a guess, it is fact.  Everybody understands that you are probably doing just as much as you can and ussually (when we are not upset) we appreciate it.  But it is obviously not enough to US, whether it is to you does not matter, you are not the customer.<P>4.<BR>--------------------<BR>&gt;"I'd like to offer a couple suggestions and then provide a small case-study to illustrate why the implementation of such suggestions (or ones similar) are needed. <BR>I think Alan's idea for "Talk" threads was a good one. That said, I do not believe Verant Management provided him the support or infrastructure to make that good idea successful. This confuses me. If Verant's data is accurate then you have approximately 300,000 active accounts which equates to about $3 Million dollars in revenue monthly plus revenue from the sale of retail boxes at $16 - $50 each. Surely, even after expenses and R&D, there are enough funds to provide a robust and thoughtful customer support engine."&lt; <P><BR>I'm not in a position to argue company revenue with anyone. <BR>---------------------<BR>Nice cop out.<P>5.<BR>---------------------<BR>&gt;"I suggest that one member of your current staff be assigned as advocate to each class. Such a person should have as their mission in life to understand the wants and needs of that segment of customer."&lt; <P><BR>So you are suggesting that we add another duty to each member of the dev team that they read all the class sites and become experts in the play of a certain class (which, it seems, would also require that they play that class up to 60th level on a live server)? They already do that. Every one of us plays the game. Members of the dev team play as many hours as anyone. And to insist that they spend their work time becoming activists for a certain class is rather silly. I think they should be developing content myself. <P>(also see all that was posted after this about this same issue)<BR>--------------------<BR>What I want to know is how many people are working there, what is the monthly costs of running this business, frankly, just how much profit are you (Verant) making each month that you (Verant) can't afford 14 people, part time, knowing it is a "contract" to do this for us?

Even when folks tell you how to code it you (Verant) still refuse to see the obvious.<P>Thank you and if I accidently put more posts up then I meant to, it was cuase I kept hitting "submit reply" by accident.<P>Fenra of Misty<BR>55 Templar of Test</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Euro, a well thought out and well written post.<BR>/agree<BR>Kudos.<P>Alan, a timely and well reasoned reply.<BR>Kudos.<P>I cannot speak for everyone, but when a vaild question is posted on this board; this is exactly the type of responce I (as a customer) would like to see.  Very few posts IMHO deserve a responce.  That being said, those few posts that do deserve a respone shout get one, and in a timely manner, just like what has occured here (again kudos to you Alan).<P>My question is this:  Why did it take contacting Mr. Scotto to get a responce?  Alan this is not an attack/flame on you, I (for one) know you are busy, and that this forum cannot remain (if it even can be) your focus throughout a work day (asside: correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe I've seen Alan post here on weekends and at night on more than one occassion).  Alan, I am assuming that part of your "job description" (as if they are EVER inclusive) is to interact with customers on these boards and in other forems.  If this is the case (and my points from here on are based upon that assumption), then something is wrong, you are not being given the time/tools needed to do you job effectively.  Again this is in no way an attack on you, rather given the lack of responces on your part, it is a conclusion based upon what I have seen.  That said, I also understand that there is no way that you can read everything that is posted on this board.  Look for the large posts that continue to stay on the first page for several days.  Once you see this, then read not the original post, but of few of the short posts beyond it.  If you see a number of /agree's or "This may be the best thought out/well written/et al post I have ever read", then read the main, decide for yourself whether you should reply or not, but remember, if that many people have posted and agreeded, it is probably important to your customers.  I, for one, do not do not expect, nor even ask, that solutions be brought to the table, rather a responce similar to the one posted here.  Just intelligent discussion, and if the original poster has vaild and intelligent rebuttals, then perhaps a responce to those.<P>Again, well done Euro.<BR>/applaud</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The average customer playing EQ I would reckon has no idea why most nerfs occur, and usually most nerfs occur due to someone comming up with a technique that is too powerful. <P>I cite the Donals Breastplate as an example. Most people, I dont think, realized that even a 30 second casting time on this item was too short. Why is this? Becuase most people never realized the value this item had in allowing a single duo of a cleric and warrior to kill anything the warrior could tank for 30 seconds. Put one of these BPs in the hands of a cleric grouped with some of the uberequiped tanks out there and you get this scenario.<P>Warrior says to guild "Get here, I can tank ubermobX for 30 seconds. We can kill it"<P>Now fast forward to post nerf, the people who actually aquired the items saw the nerf comming and as such are frustrated by loosing there overpowered toy but really dont ***** about it becuase they knew it was gonna happen. Your average eqplayer however has no idea why it was nerfed and as such sees it as some misunderstood attack on their class. How dare Verant!?<P>Most of the time the communication that comes to the EQ player base as a whole occurs AFTER the changes it seems. There most certainly is communication with the eqplayers, just primarily after the fact as opposed to before when it would be most beneficial. I feel that more energy expended on preventing negative responses, will greatly lessen the need for reactionary posts.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

It's a pretty simple one, really. I have listed the problems that the classes have given me. We don’t know if we are committed to fixing all of them (or any of them) until we actually look them over and decide if they are indeed problems. You tell me that we should trust our customers. But, well, I know that you don't trust all of your fellow players to tell the absolute truth, or to look at the situation from a neutral place, for the good of the game. Sure, most do. But we still have to look at each idea and make certain that it is a problem and that the suggested solution works for the game as a whole. &gt;&gt;&gt;<P><BR>Once again thats not entirely true what you did was take the ideas and suggestions of the players in regard to certain class issues assuming they either <P>a) fit your perception of the class<BR>b)Fit your concept of the "vision" <P>That does'nt cut it.If you can't understand what a class actually does post 50 for example how can you advocate equitable and realistic change and the addressing of the problems therein?Fact is you can't and as a result you are'nt an advocate for improvement you are a mouthpiece for the "vision".<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;So you are suggesting that we add another duty to each member of the dev team that they read all the class sites and become experts in the play of a certain class (which, it seems, would also require that they play that class up to 60th level on a live server)?

</FONT><HR>Long Post Warning<P><BR>-----<BR>EuroEQ: &gt;&gt;"Please, do not get defensive, but in my humble opinion, your customer service is woeful. "How can that be? We have such a high retention rate. Things must be pretty good. ...Here is my hypothesis. Few accounts are truly canceled. Many are either sold on Ebay or absorbed into a guild....&lt; <P>Alan:&gt;Again, such things are against the UELA (I think that's the acronym). <P>~And, being against the rules, it must never happen, thus invalidating EuroEQ’s point.  Right.  It happens.  Saying its against the rules DOESNT in any way change EuroEQs basic point.  It means that if you REALLY wanted to stop it you could.  If EuroEQ is right, it’ll cost you some revenue. <BR>----<P>----<BR>EuroEQ&gt;"Many people who play your game are, quite frankly, addicted. I do not disparage them but this subset of your customer-base is largely unaffected by poor customer service. ...."&lt; <P>Alan:  Fair enough. I'll accept that there are customers (and not just customers of Verant, but just customers in general) that will be satisfied with very little customer service. I will also concede that there are a group of players that have already reached the end of their time with our game and will move on when a suitable alternative comes along.  But I would argue that their reactions have little to do with customer service, and everything to do with the kind of customers they are (neither good nor bad, just their nature). Some people will move on to the next best thing regardless of what we do, and others have played themselves out on EverQuest. We do our best to retain these people, obviously. <P>-Few of us see any effort to retain people.  And any company that believes that ‘their reactions have little to do with customer service’ is deluding themselves.  Few things matter MORE to a companies ability to retain customers in a competitive environment than customer service.<BR>----<P>----<BR>EuroEQ"I think the major issues with the game came when you expanded the characters beyond lvl 50 in an enviornment that was never designed to support it. You have major balance issues between melee and casters because of the wealth of melee items and the relative scarcity of both spells and caster items."&lt; <P>Alan: I disagree. I think that the environment could support extended levels. Though I readily admit that the implementation of those extended levels wasn't perfect. That does not reflect the ability of the game to support such expansion. It only exposes the fact that we need to work more on making it work. We've already made several strides to reach that goal, and I think we'll have it all fixed up soon enough. <P>-Yes, the environment CAN BE MADE to support extended levels.  However, the implementation of the extended levels was so poorly conceived that it created the perception that it cannot.  But the specific points he makes (i.e. the general uselessness of casters at the higher levels, and the domination of the game by tanks and the clerics to heal them) have been addressed numerous time (and ignored by the ‘blue names’) in numerous other threads.  To see you dismiss his claims here is not surprising given your track record of ignoring those threads.<BR>-----<P>-----<BR>EuroEQ&gt;"I am starting to delv into the minutia and that is not my intent so let me raise my points up a level. <BR>I think you are doing a terrible job of communicating with your customers. I am a customer and that is my perception. Many here seem to have the same perception. Perceptions of one's customers is reality...trust me it is. Your customers feel you are adversarial with them. They believe that you think they will destroy "your" game with their unbalanced ideas. Perhaps you are right...but they (we) are the customers so how do you communicate your concerns while answering ours."&lt; <P>Alan: I'll have to take your word on that. I don't see that myself, but then again I work here. But I talk to customers a lot, and I get a different feeling about it. <P>--How can you NOT see that the people feel you are adversarial with them?  I guess you DONT read the threads.  Almost every single thread, as soon as it reaches three pages without a single response degenerates into “Look, they are ignoring us again,; Verant doesn’t care about the players;  Look Out!  Verant’s gonna nerf us again!”  I bet you cant find a single thread on this board longer than 10 posts that doesnt have at least one adversarial post.  The PERCEPTION of an adversarial corporation is damaging and should be fought against, even if it is unwarranted.  And in your case, it does appear to be warranted in many cases.<BR>----<P>----<BR>EuroEQ&gt;"I'd like to offer a couple suggestions and then provide a small case-study to illustrate why the implementation of such suggestions (or ones similar) are needed. I think Alan's idea for "Talk" threads was a good one. That said, I do not believe Verant Management provided him the support or infrastructure to make that good idea successful. This confuses me. If Verant's data is accurate then you have approximately 300,000 active accounts which equates to about $3 Million dollars in revenue monthly plus revenue from the sale of retail boxes at $16 - $50 each. Surely, even after expenses and R&D, there are enough funds to provide a robust and thoughtful customer support engine."&lt; <P>Alan: I'm not in a position to argue company revenue with anyone. <P>-Granted.  Nevertheless...the perception is...Someone is getting rich and the money seems like it oughta be there.  Just because you aren’t willing to  (or are unable) to discuss finances DOESN”T change the perception that the resources are there and ought to be used for our (the customer’s) benefit.<BR>-----<P>-----<BR>EuroEQ&gt;"I suggest that one member of your current staff be assigned as advocate to each class. Such a person should have as their mission in life to understand the wants and needs of that segment of customer."&lt; <P>Alan: So you are suggesting that we add another duty to each member of the dev team that they read all the class sites and become experts in the play of a certain class (which, it seems, would also require that they play that class up to 60th level on a live server)? They already do that. Every one of us plays the game. Members of the dev team play as many hours as anyone. And to insist that they spend their work time becoming activists for a certain class is rather silly. I think they should be developing content myself.   <P>--No, he is suggesting that rather than the current hit-or –miss system whereby each plays some class or set of classes, they be assigned to be expert in a single class.  If you are lucky, each class already has a player on the development team and thus the only difference would be a change in the focus of their effort (according to you, ‘they already do that’).  And, if there are classes that are NOT represented by a player on the team, THAT IS A PROBLEM.<BR>----<P>----<BR>EuroEQ&gt;"Each class should have an interactive page on the EQ website through which to see a regularly updated status on their issues."&lt; <P>Alan: I would argue that there aren't so many 'issues' as you seem to think. To keep up the kind of interaction you seem to want would be a full-time job. <P>--If there are so few issues, then why is keeping up with them a full time task (as you suggest).  I don’t believe you can have it both ways.  If there are very few issues, then adding a requirement to stay on top of them (advocate role) is no big deal.  And if the issues are many and complex, then the need for a web page is significant.  To further make the point...If there are so few issues, then why did it take 100 pages of posts  PER CLASS to communicate what the classes thought were the problems.    Every single class I am familiar with has at least a dozen issues that THEY think are important, despite a lack of support or any response to these issues from Verant.<BR>----<P>-----<BR>EuroEQ&gt;"You might say that you already have such advocates as part of your tuning team. Great! Tell us who they are. Have them engage us. You don't know how lucky you are to have a vibrant customer base that WANTS to tell you what they think. Most companies have to pay 3rd parties to find quasi-interested pseudo-customers who then provide their input...for a fee.  These 14 folks would, of course, also have to maintain the objectivity one would expect of a Verant employee as opposed to a purist player. The "good-of-the-game" would temper the natural desire to advance the position of their advocacy group beyond what is reasonable."&lt; <P>Alan:  Here's where you'll have to trust me. An advocate that is objective and looks for the good of the game, would be unable to please the players that truly feel that they need an advocate. If a player points out a problem and is logical about the problem, he doesn't need an advocate. That problem is a problem, regardless of the class of the player.  I've spent a lot of time lately getting to know the desires of the players that identify themselves with a particular class. I've written up those desires, purposefully excluding the ones that did not take into account the good of the game. And yet, as is obvious by your post, I am not considered an 'advocate' for any of them. Why is that? I have done as you have described. I have listened to the players, responded to them (over a longer period of time than I would have if I was only dealing with one class), and listed their concerns. I have been an 'advocate' as you described. <BR>And yet, you clearly do not see me as such. <P>--You are not seen as an advocate for two reasons:<P>--1) You do not respond to issues in a timely manner.  For someone whose JOB is to respond to the customer base and interact with them, you do a lousy job.  Following the cleric healing nerf, you DID NOT MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL POST FOR  over 10 DAYS!  This is customer service/ relations?<BR>Regarding the class talk threads....You no doubt noticed that many of the same things were posted over and over and over and over again.  Just think how much simpler your job would have been if you had periodically RESPONDED and said:  The following issues have been mentioned several times......Items 1 – 5 are items I will be including in my list, items 6 and 7 cannot be implemented for the following reasons and I do not fully understand item 8......It would have saved you a great deal of repetitive reading (and us a great deal of repetitive posting), and allowed all to focus on things that MIGHT actually be changeble.  In otherwords...Try a DIALOGUE, rather than just sitting back, collecting page after page of posts and trying to summarize them all into the final talk thread (as you did).  After all....was ANY class happy with your final ‘understanding’ of what they wanted?   <P>--2) You have biases that are in direct contradiction to what the players of that class tell you and are not willing to consider changes to your opinion.  Examples:  From shaman and enchanter talk threads:<BR>    Shaman:  You believe that the primary function of a shaman is to buff at the higher levels (despite hundreds of posts telling you that because the buffs are of negligible value) and not to DEBUFF, which is what all  shamans really do at high level.<BR>    Enchanters:  You STARTED the enchanter thread by stating that because they were seen as essential in Kunark they were too powerful and probably needed to be nerfed.<P>--Neither of these are consistant with a role as either an  advocate OR as an unbiased developer.<P>Alan *shrug* <P>--*Shrug*<BR>----<P>----<BR>EuroEQ"I would just love to see the look on one of my customer's faces if I told them I would not share my team's project schedule. Communicate with us; tell us what's up. If you miss a date...so what."&lt; <P>Alan:  Wow. You either have never missed a date, or you just don't pay attention to the response from customers when you do. I don't mean to be harsh here, but you're out of touch. Nothing will get people more upset than missing a deadline.   But that's not the reason that we don't spend our time posting up each and every deadline. <P>--Hmmm..I respectfully but STRONGLY disagree.   LACK OF COMMUNICATION IS FAR LESS FORGIVABLE THAN MISSING A DEADLINE.   Why do you think companies that PRETEND to have customer service (I’m talking about companies that aren’t Verant) still pay people to answer phones and send out nice ‘thank you for your concern’ letters, etc.  Its because the ILLUSION of communication can SOMETIMES stand in for true concern.  Not for very long, and not very well, but IT IS BETTER THAN HITTING A DEAD END WHEN YOU TRY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE COMPANY.  <BR> Lets look at what happened  in one of the FEW occasions when a timeline was actually (perhaps inadvertently) released.  The Shaman Iksar quests have been broken since Kunark release.  A month ago, we were promised a fix “on the next patch”.  The patch came and went and NO FIX.  Yes, we got very upset.  But what got us upset was NOT that the date was missed.  It was that the posts asking about the missed date were IGNORED.  The posts asking  for an acknowledgement that the quest was still broken were IGNORED.  The posts asking for ANY COMMENT AT ALL were IGNORED.  Finally...We got a response (Oops, sorry I forgot.  The fix will go in on the patch after the next patch).  And we are all happy again.  THE BENEFIT FROM THE COMMUNICATION MORE THAN OUTWEIGHED THE DISMAY AT THE MISSED DEADLINE.  Yes, the 12 year olds will be upset that they cant have their fix NOW.  But the adults UNDERSTAND missed deadlines (and have probably missed one or two in their own jobs).  And (to return to an earlier point)...The KIDS will keep playing regardless of CS. The ADULTS are the ones who CARE about how a company treats them and WILL leave for a more customer oriented game when one comes out.<BR>------<P>------<BR>EuroEQ&gt;"Tell us why its going to be delayed and give us a new date. You know, I bet dimes to donuts that if the high-powered healing items were discussed in an open forum, even in general terms so as not to ruin the excitement, the uncomfortable issues you now face would have been avoided."&lt; <P>Alan: We do that now. There is no timeline about your class that you do not already know about.<P><BR>--Thats pretty sad.  Because, since we know of NO TIME LINES  for our class, that means that YOU HAVE NO INTERNAL timelines.  No wonder nothing gets done.  Maybe you should focus on some INTERNAL controls and maybe (!!!!!) SET SOME TIMELINES?  Perhaps some performance goals for the employees?  Make those responsble for fixing quests accountable to a timeline (OK team, lets try to get all the Kunark quests working by the one year anniversary....)<BR>-----<P>------<BR>EuroEQ&gt;"Guys...this is basic business here. You will have amazed and delighted customers. You will develop loyalty that will enable you to retain customers through the release of "the next best thing.  Brad...when was the last time you delighted a customer? Why do people pay 2x as much to get a shirt at Nordstrom? Because Nordstrom strives every day to delight every customer. ..&lt; <P>Alan:  But we don't charge twice the price… I suppose if we did, then we could double the size of the EQLive team and hire people to be advocates.<P>--The point isn’t that Nordstrom charges twice as much.  The point is that CUSTOMERS ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR AND DEMAND SERVICE.  To put it another way.....People dont go to Nordstrom BECAUSE they pay more.  People go to Nordstrom because THEY PROVIDE SERVICE, DESPITE the higher cost.  The message for you is that...when the next game comes along, people will go to the game with the BETTER SERVICE (probably even if they DO charge a little more than you do).<P>Alan:   But that does not mean that our current system isn't good. I'm going to defend it, and only partially because that system is me. Even if there were fourteen people running around here insisting that changes be made to their class, the dev team would still have to sit down and evaluate the ideas presented. They are still going to have to get their daily tasks done. There is still going to be time between a request and a response. <P>--Ok, but can we reduce the time between a request and AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THAT REQUEST?<BR>The real problem people have is the LACK OF COMMUNICATION, not the lack of rapid fixes.  PLEASE read the posts (at least the ones that get beyond some magic number..say 25) and post that you HAVE READ THEM.  You dont necessariily need to address fixes, anything else...Just tell us you are READING the posts.  Fake it if you have to, but something.<BR>-------<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Not only was this untrue but it was your normal snooty attitude you give so many of your customers.  I read the questions and they were simple yes or no answers, you either were doing them or you were not.  If he asks if you have something planned you either do or you dont.  Yes its that simple.  Why did you even bother to respond?<P>I wish you would go away and let someone who can be more civil to people.  You got big problems coming soon.  If you dont think a new game is going to create an exodus of players, just ask origin about that.  When this happens your boss is going to be looking for answers and is gonna want to know why your customer base wasnt loyal.  Guess who's head will be on the chopping block. Must be amazing to know everything.  Its unfortunate that 300k people dont know whats good for the game like you do.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan,<P>I am greatly saddened to see that you chose to focus on attacking the minutiae of the examples cited in EuroEQ's post while ignoring the greater issues presented.<P>Instead of using this thread (which contained several pages of well thought out posts concerning customer perception of customer service, etc.) as an opportunity to engage in a discussion of customer service issues and how they may be addressed, you attacked the initial post on points.  In doing so you ignored some, and decried the rest of the real issues that EuroEQ and others were trying to express. <P>You as much as stated that you were not responding to the post as a whole, but rather to the individual paragraphs:<P>"Ah, sheesh, maybe I should read one paragraph ahead before responding…"<P>My general "take" form EuroEQ's post was that his perception, via impirical (and somewhat anecdotal) evidence is that customer satisfaction is low.  He then went on to try to suggest a few ways to improve customer satisfaction.<P>In doing so he cited guild-supported, "cancelled" accounts (whether they violate EULA or not is irrelevant to the point being made), as evidence that customer retention may not be as high as otherwise perceived.<P>He also mentioned the large number of "addicted" players, who will continue to play regardless off the level of customer support.  In doing so, I believe he was trying to point out that addicts just want their fix, and when sources of that fix are available, they will move on as long as no loyalty to the current source is established first.  This analogy in EQ terms is if a game comes along that is significantly similar to EQ, then the large "addicted" player base will go to them, as they have no loyalty to EQ.<P>The reason most people have little loyalty to EQ, is that the company is perceived as taking an adversarial position when dealing with customer concerns, in many if not most cases.  Sadly, you provided anecdotal evidence for this argument by taking an adversarial position when responding to the post.<P>The point is that the perception of a large number of your customers is that interactions with customer service are for the most part unsatisfying.  This perception could be "fixed" to some degree if some large enough number of persons from customer service were tasked with advocating customer concerns to the company at large, and reporting back to the customers with the progress of those concerns (a position similar to that of an ombudsman).<P>As long as well-meaning, non-confrontational posts like the one that started this thread are ignored (or only responded to by customer support after being escalated), and the responses from customer support are point-by-point attacks of the initial post rather than well-meaning consideration of the overall issues being raised by the initial post and subsequent posts by others to the thread, then customer perception will be that customer service is at best apathetic and at worst adversarial.<P>Sorry if I misinterpreted your meanings, EuroEQ.<P>Odred (retired from MT)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>His point on customer service, the basic thrust of his email, was very good and valid.<BR>I am sure many people have suffered from bugs etc, and have required the help of a GM. Unfortunately however, most guides have very little ability to do anything. Perhaps locate your corpse and summon it for you. However, the only one with any real power is the GM, and that person is only ever on for a fraction of the day. Firstly, the GM's times are generally US centric, so if you are not a Yank, you are not on with the GM. Secondly the GM is often not available. This is most likely because they are flat out looking after petitions like they should. However the fact remains that it is very hard to get hold of them. The number of GMs in game with real "power" should be increased so that there is near 24 hour access. <BR>As an example, we formed our guild just over a week ago. During the process it kind of melded with another guild, so that the 2 guilds became one, and some of us had one guild name over our heads, and the rest another. On logging, our leader lost his leadership. This took 17 hours of petition camping during the following week to get it fixed. Partially because we are not on when our GM is on, and secondly because there was just no response when he was on. THe main problem here was we HAD to wait for the GM, no guide could do it.<P>Late 2000 my character's name was changed without warning. Consequently when I died I came back with a new name and could not loot my corpse. No guide could help me, although they were very friendly and tried. The GM went away for some time (not a bad thing over xmas), however it left our server with noone to fulfill the role that only a GM can fulfill (ie guild problems, name change problems etc). It took over 1 month, and several emails and petitions to finally get that character back.<P>Admittedly the guides and customer support have to deal with a lot of "nasty" and useless communication. People lack politeness in a major way in these forums, and in game too I suspect.  I hope they get paid well for it.<P>My other complaint regarding Verant/Sony's communication is regarding server downtimes. If they deem the servers need to go down for maintenance then I accept it, for in the interests of their mega profits they would want as little downtime as possible. However they could be a little more communicative about it. As it stands we have to go to their web site and look up two separate web pages, which are a little poorly organised. It would be far nicer if we could receive emails regarding our server, and its downtimes. It would also be good if they could give us a message when we log on that indicates when the next server is going down. Something like the ads for the best of the best that come up when you log on with your character.<P>More importantly however, I cannot understand why they do not do their maintenance in 2 groups. They choose always to do it during a certain time, which happens to be our game time in this part of the world, so some of us are continually paying the price. In some weeks we get 3 nights of downtime, which sucks really if you can only play those nights.<P>If they choose to do the downtime at the quietest time, then they could easily do it in 2 groups. It would be easy to restrict which server you played on depending on whether you had received the latest patch or not. And then you could keep secondaries on another sever so that you don't have to keep missing out all the time. It would not overload the servers, as they do the patches at the quiet time anyway, at which time there is usually 18-20% of the full load of players anyway.<P>And regarding value for money.  This game in Australia costs the same as most other good quality games like StarCraft etc to buy.  The difference is we pay another $120 (3 times the game cost) each year for the privelege to play.  For this additional large sum in gaming terms, I expect a lot more from the corporation which provides it.  Saying that this arm of Sony's profits is so small it does not warrant proper support is no reason for not providing it.  We have a right to expect a LOT more than we get from other gaming companies.  I accept that in addition we get a dynamic environment with new material (most of which we have to pay extra for though).  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>300,000 to 1?  Bah.  More like 30 to 1.<P>I don't play EQ much these days.  Haven't felt the need to (Yay! I kicked the habit!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">).  Was it because of bad customer service?  Was it because of the nerfs?  Was it because the classes weren't balanced?  Nope.  I CHOSE not to after 2 years of playing and finally realizing that there's nothing gained from it in real life.<P>Why can't you people do the same thing, instead of berating 1 person who's job is to make Verant money, not service your every little whim?  For $9/month, there's no way you can say you're paying for [personalized] customer service.  If you were paying $50/month, then you'd have something to complain about.<P>"The customer is always right" only works for businesses that NEED customers.  EQ doesn't need customers at this time.  The customers aggressively clamor over each other just to play, EVEN THOUGH some complain about it almost daily.  So why expect customer service when they can't afford the type you want at $9/month (which is personalized service)?<P>If everyone one of you truly put your money where your mouth is, you'd have quit playing long ago.  When will you learn?  Your money doesn't pay for the game.  It pays for the use of the game servers.  That's the business model that you're subscribing to.  Face it, you DON'T pay their wages.  Sony pays their wages regardless of the number of players.  You PAY to get your fix, and that's it.<P>If you want better service, ask for it and wait.  If it doesn't materialize, go find something else that can service your needs.  But don't keep complaining, whining, accusing, belittling, and arguing, because that's counterproductive to your cause.  Think about it.  How much easier is it for your girlfriend to convince you of something when she's being nice and patient, rather than a nagging wench?  Verant isn't just bricks and computers.  It's a bunch of human beings, with emotions and feelings.  Don't expect them to react positively under the conditions you put them in, when you wouldn't in their shoes (I've noticed this about both Absor and Gordon since they came on these boards, both of their demeanor went from "Happy customer relations person, at your service!" to "Someone shoot me! After you shoot that poster."  Hmm...wonder why?)<P>Life is too short to get upset over a game company's POLICY.  Enjoy it while it lasts, and then move on.  Because after the fun is gone, life goes on.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Apparently you don't understand math Absor. You don't have to hire 14 people to do this. If you were to hire just 3 or 4 people you could accomplish this goal. Hmm how could this be? Well you have a DEV team all ready if you were to put these people on the DEV team it would reduce the workload of the entire team allowing them all to take on one new responsibility. I actually believe if you took volunteers from the Dev team for each class most the classes would be covered quite quickly and if there was a class not covered then your DEV team probably doesn't understand that class very well from the start. It seems to me that your job isn't communication it is rather to debunk every idea that comes along. You may attempt to be fair but as it stands now people really think that your DEV team hates clerics and Necromancers. You tell us that it is not true well that's not what matters the only thing that does matter is you created a situation were the perception exists and that perception is everything at this point. You always tell us I talk to many customers. Well when I am in game every person I talk to is a customer. You act like when people play this game that we don't talk to each other, either you think we are stupid or you just don't think.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just to let you guys know, I'm a former player who has cancled his account.  I enjoyed my time playing but things kept naging me to death.  Things that realy shouldnt have been. Things like the constent release of expanstions, the constent stance from varent that the custumer is wrong, and the everpresent lack of fun if your still trying to get into the game.  <P>The Expansions realy get my goat because I had to spend another 70 bucks to get kunark and venelios.  To me that was a bad call on verents part to have made Kunark a full game and price it at $50. Had verant sold it as a $20 expasion like they did with ven then i might not be rambeling on like this.<P>My second point was about Verent's stance that the custemer is wrong.  Yes I do see it this way.  Many Great Ideas have been posted on the forums before, And all but a small hand full (mostly downgrading of stuff to suit another class) were even considered or even implemented.  Many ideas on topics such as adding more to fishing, bakeing, brewing, and other such "Non-Important" skills have been posted and been put in the "We will pass it on to the live team to see what they think" wastebasket.  Look at UO.  They encurage ppl to be chiefs, basket weavers, fletchers, and FISHERMAN.  Some of the shops on UO even get their stuff from ppl who make it and sell it.  There is no real fun in it but hey its another way to pass the time and when most of the areas are camped 98% of the time(Crushbone for example) it's always fun to sit on the banks and fish or do something to pass the time while waiting on a camp to open or to even wait on what your camping.  Geting back on subject not only ideas but when I lost all my equipment on my highest lvl char at the time (a lvl 11 bard back when kunark was about to be uploaded on the servers), it made me mad.  They had just announced that the severs where about to come down and i was about to sit and camp but when i hit the sit button my computer froze.  6 or 7 hours later when the server was back up and i reconnected i was surpised when i didnt have any of my equipment(not cheap **** eather mostly bronze and shinny steal stuff with a kick butt polearm if i can remember correctly.) I petitioned for help and finaly a guide msged me and i told him the situation and he told me i would have to get with the gm of the server. he gave me his email addy and i emailed him.  No response ever came to the email.  Finaly 3 days later i tracked him down on the server and I told him the situation and he checked.  He said he couldnt do anything for me and that i was in the wrong for not loging off.  BULL.  I tryed.  Yet they said it was my fault(This btw is one of the 2 real reasons why I dont play anymore).<P>As for the ever present lack of fun in the game Who realy wants to camp an area for up to 20 hours to get an item.  I do understand that some ppl enjoy that.  Well I dont.  If i am going to do that it's because there is something else that i could do(eg try and get better at fishing or fletching or even jeweling) while i wait for the enemy to come back.  I dont like siting around for hours on end looking at the ground where something is supost to spawn only to discover that it spawns right where i am siting and cant respawn because somethings in it's spawn point. (done this a few times with the orcs)  <P>Anyway I though i would put my 2 cents in about CS and the lack of fun in EQ.  Hopefuly Planetside, the starwars game, AO, UO2, EQ2(Not to say i will buy it but hey its on the list of future MMORPG), and Neo all have taken a lession from EQ and learned How not to treat their customer.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I've written up those desires, purposefully excluding the ones that did not take into account the good of the game. And yet, as is obvious by your post, I am not considered an 'advocate' for any of them. Why is that? I have done as you have described. I have listened to the players, responded to them (over a longer period of time than I would have if I was only dealing with one class), and listed their concerns. I have been an 'advocate' as you described.<P>And yet, you clearly do not see me as such.<P>*shrug*<BR>--------------------------<P>You listed their concerns, and that was about it...followed by some serious nerfing and direct changes that are having a MAJOR impact on the the way this game as worked for the last 2 years...you made these changes WITHOUT talking to you player base first concerning their opinions, and said it was for the good of the game in the long run....2years??? how can this be good for a game that has been out for 2 years...and what percentage of changes "listed" were actually implemented? How does that qualify as good customer service? <P>In your posts for the class threads, you even stated you had no idea what some of the classes meant or what some spells do etc...and in some, yer perception of what was asked for was completely wrong...how can you claim to be an advocate for something you know nothing about?<P>and the last comment...your little *shrug*<P>hurray for apathy...that *shrug* was vile...we dont percieve you as an advocate..we tell you so...you tell us we know nothing and shrug it off...huzzah!<BR> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>~Psy~</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just a quick thought for you Absor.  What would be nice is a person that we do not have to educate from the ground up about ever concern a class has.  If you don't play a Shaman you don't know the problems with Alchemy or Canabilize 2.  If you don't play a barb you wouldn't know about te problems with switching items, I didn't.  So if we have to explain the basics of the class that the problem comes from we have to first get you to read that.  <P>Alchemy posts fade on the board so fast I feel almost assured that they never get a look.  The reason is not that this is not a problem but because many feel you will not give it time.  I am being honest here.  Not to get this off topic but the alchemy problems are not new they are very old and still go unfixed.  <P>If you notice class complaints come in waves.  Notice that many classes just stopped talking about things?  We feel as if we are trying to convince the mountain that it is falling on our little village.  If you had people not as advocates but as specialists they might actually see AND understand the problems.  And posting problems in the class specifice boards does not seem to work as you almost exclusively reply to messages here on the main boards.  You could almost remove those for the lack of trust that is given that they are ever read.  Please don't just say "well of course I read them" when they almost never get responses from you that you listen or were even there.  You give us the impression that if we want to heard we have to come here and selflessly bump them to get them looked at.  Even if that is not true it is how the player feel things have to be done.  If you want to change this start talking to us in the other boards.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>[Quote from original post: So, to recap. <BR>1) Verant should employ, class specific, advocates.] <BR>Absor, "We're not hiring fourteen new people to do this. Our dev team is too busy (as they should be). It's my job to try to be those fourteen people. And I can do it, I just can't do it as fast as fourteen people can."<P>No, you cant and havn't done it, the shaman class is a great example of your lack of understanding of our class. You can not have a real discussion with us and you avoid it all costs because you know you have no clue and do not want to make a fool of yourself. Pls do us a favor and at least stop pretending you know what your doing for every class, because you dont.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
