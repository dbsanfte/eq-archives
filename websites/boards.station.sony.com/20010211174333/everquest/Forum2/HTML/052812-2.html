</FONT><HR>Now I'm not a monk, but I've read monks wanting more damage without giving much specifics as to how.

</FONT><HR>I just have a moment to post here so I'll keep it short this time... <P>Monks are hampered by the 14 pound weight limit and cannot typically afford a tinkerer's bag until well into their 40s or sometimes 50s (mine was a gift from a friend.  My character has never seen 5k in the bank at one time.)  <P>Make a MONK ONLY quest for a NO DROP 100% weight reduction bag that can carry 10 SMALL items.  This would help a monk with a spot for food, bandages and some of the soulbound items that they now must carry.  <P>The level for this should be about 25 to 30ish and the bag should not be made available for any other classes.  25 to 30ish does NOT mean to place quest items on 55+ ultra rare spawns deep in Skyfire.  This quest should be easy enough to complete that it is considered as much a mid-level "right of passage" as the mid-level armors are for all other classes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Existing issues:<BR>Monk's do not have enough damage mitigation and total hit points...<P>Raise damage output by 10-15% and bring HTH up to 90-95% of weapon damage.<P>Add SOME way to stop or reduce incoming physical and magical attacks.  I would suggest adding an extra dodge, parry or block.  Best would be to make it's success dex modified (since the original docs SAID Dex was a prime monk ability).  Works only from things in front of the monk.<P>Spells that HURT a warrior instantly kill a monk (mend is no good if you can't USE it).  Certain melee attacks in vellious essentially do the same thing.  <P>Monks can literally be killed before they can be healed.<P>PLEASE adjust Shiverback by adding about 1AC per piece.  And addressing the "lack of hit points" issue- how about adding 5 to 15 hit points per piece.<P>Finally- PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix un-armed Hand to Hand damage to be 90%-95% of weapon damage.  Monks work for 50 levels to be the ultimate unarmed fighting machine and then you suddenly FORCE them to use weapons.<P>Sure- leave the "best" damage to those with the "leet" weapons.  But monks WERE one of the great casual classes because they didn't HAVE to spend tons of time getting equipment.<P>---<BR>New Stuff<P>Two points on ADND monks vs EQ monks<P>One is the movement.<BR>It would be nice if there was a L35ish discipline which sped movement up for 10 minutes per hour.  A nice thing to help monks escape when the Sow ran out but not anything useful in general.<P>The other is hide in shadows, ninja abilities and so on.<P>It would be nice if monks had some kind of self invisibility disciplines at some level.  Perhaps 60 seconds at L51 to start increasing up to 10 minutes at L60.<P><BR>---<BR>Bugs<P>FIX FD in Vellious.  Once you start a battle it currently seems to actually AGGRO mobs instead of wiping them.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Oh yes-..<P>Agree with the idea of adding special abilities to the "dead" attack skills.<P>If round kick had stun- you would still have a reason to use it.<P>Perhaps some old abilities might gain new twists as you got high level- like a criticial hit on a normal kick after you reach level 50.<P>By giving each monk attack a different special abilitiy- a monk would start having to choose their combat abilities appropriate to the encounter.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm going to add my 2 cents here real quick. First off let me say that I enjoy my monk and I get great joy out of playing her. There some things though that mostly just annoy me on a day to day basis and I think they are things that should be addressed. <P>As mentioned above an increase in the minimum damage for the Thunderkick. At level 60, the refresh is roughly 4 mins and most of us have experienced the laughter that ensues after landing a 24-point Thunderkick. At least increase the minimum damage to something similar as the rogue backstab, where the minimum damage is equal to the level of the character. I could "live" with a 60 point minimum kick. Just by increasing the minimum damage, the possible average kick itself goes up, so this might be something to look into changing.<P>Next is the epic fists. I honestly don't feel that the 9 damage 17 (or is it 16?) delay that the Celestial Fists gives us is "epic". It's roughly like wielding 2 Jade Maces while wearing some nice gloves. I think maybe increasing our fists to 11 damage although the number seems minor, really makes a huge difference in damage and would really make our fists pretty epic-like at that point. Something to consider. Some people might say "But the fists give you increased haste." My response is who cares about the haste when half of your guild can give out Speed of the Shissar. As more and more days pass in EQ, more and more enchanters get their epic staff and I peronsally feel in essence makes the value of our fists go down. Why 40% song when you can have 60% Shissar? I honestly do not use my song on my CFs very often at all. Just another issue to think about.<P>Lastly from me is something that I feel is above all these issues and that's look. I pulled up screenshots of myself from level 5. I look EXACTLY the same way as I do now and I find that very disturbing. Cured Silk to Shiverback to Silver Moon and I look EXACTLY the same. Why is that? Why should I have to look for armor other than my planar armor? Why is it that every single class BUT monks, from the original game to kunark to velious expansions got new sets of armor with new looks? Why is that? Did you run out of ideas for looks? Not creative enough? What made you just leave monks out when it came to new graphics? If someone can answer this question I would appreciate it. I know other monks feel the same way about this too. Those of who have been fortunate enough to loot some of this cool armor want to be apart from the normal look of monks. Just like warriors with Berserker or Cobalt or any other class out there with specific armor or robes. Just another thing to think about.<P>Carissa<BR>Level 60 Monk<BR>Sol Invictus, The Tribunal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Repost from EQMonks boards,<P>I've been thinking of some way to make Humans a viable monk race other than RP reasons and faction issues and I think I've found something that'd fit the way a Monk works and not be too overpowering, just enough to make Humans viable.<P>Give Human monks Hide at level 40ish, that works similar to Rogue sneak/hide with a few differences so it doesnt step on Rogues toes:<BR>Does not have the Invis Vs. Undead addition<BR>Speed does not increase with level 51+<BR>Does not have the successful hide/sneak messages<BR>Caps lower (113 as per Sneak)<P>It would make sense in a roleplay mannor since Monks have such great control over their bodys, are naturally nible, etc. They would be able to be as stealthy as rogues in most respects. It would also fit that Iksar don't get it, since their race can't be rogues and it would be harder to sneak around with a huge tail.<P>The only reason I say Iksar shouldn't get it, is because they already have a number of side-features which make them viable (Forage, Regen, etc.). Being able to sneak/hide would definately make someone wonder if they should pick Human or Iksar.. in my opinion.<P>Just an idea, seems like it'd be a neat little thing to give Humans Monks to make them a little more played by new players. Not looking to start an Iksar vs. Human battle, or start flames, so just don't bother replying if that's the intent.<P>cut__<P>From a powergamer point of view heres what you see when you're rolling your character:<P>Human - Normal vision, normal regen, balanced stats, ability to wear some items Iksar can't, no racial exp penalty<P>Iksar - Night vision, extra regen, monk-centric stats, forage (not huge, but still nice at low levels), higher innate AC, 20% exp penalty, inability to wear some nice plate based items.<P>If somebody wanted to twink a monk for pure power, they'd pick iksar, theres really no "Oh.. I don't know" factor. I think if Humans were given something interesting that Iksar don't get that it would make people think.. "Hmm, Iksar get regen/ac.. but Humans can hide/sneak.. choices choices". Thus making Humans more viable to people starting out.<P>Taurean Fistfall<BR>Mythic Legion - Druzzil Ro </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>[Considering level 51 to 60 only.]<P>Monks should have greater damage evasion skills than they currently have post 50.  By this I mean Dodge, Block, Riposte, and maybe another.  They are martial arts experts after all.<P>Post 50 the other pure melee classes close the gap very significantly on monks in this area, and the other pure melee classes also get a huge AC boost with better equipment and a major increase in defence.<P>Increased evasion skills will not turn monks into group tanks.  The reduced hitpoints and volitility of damage taken renders CH far less safe and less mana efficient (not to mention the lack of taunt), so I don't think monks would be replacing Warriors as main tanks.  But monk are one of the two pure 'toe to toe' melee classes and that should not be forgotten.<P><BR>I also think that bare hand stats should be re-balanced as new equipment enters the game, and at level 55 upwards it should be higher than it is at present.<P><BR>Regarding other issues, I think you should look at the Treant Fist quest.  I believe this quest is in danger of becoming obsolete, due to new, better, tailored items becoming available.  Treant Fists used to have an effect (removed as it was too powerful).  Giving them an effect such as serpent sight or summon bandages would keep people interested in the quest, and also avoid them becoming no-drop bank trash post-epic.<P><BR>How about some new quests from the monk guilds in Qeynos and Freeport that result in lightweight, low AC, good resist armor?  Just a thought.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>brin_summer says:<BR>"actually, i think weight limit is fair. we just need more lighter items"<P>I agree, but since the inception of the monk class and the 14 pound limit, monk inventory requirements have changed a lot.  Now they have to carry heavy weapons to practice with as well as carry a lot of relatively weightless items (HS key, Sebilis key, etc) that still take slot space.  Unfortunately, even though an item weighs 0.0, if you need another bag or pack to carry them in, you are still adding new weight.  Cured silk was a nice addition, but mostly for looks.  A monk could wear about the same weight prior to cured silk in mesh items, but the look was "leather".<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Most of the runs have been successful, I'm level 52 and have probably the highest FR out of anyone for Naggy and quite good CR for Vox. The reason I die, is because I tank. I can wait till the dragon is at 80% and then charge in, but by the time they are down to 50% I'm tanking as usual. I can FD and sit there (not doing damage, but taking it from the breath), and then get up a while later and bam, im tanking again.<P>2) I spend almost half my time in Sebilis lying on the ground trying to give the warrior 3 levels higher than me weilding lam+silk whip time to get the frogs off me so the cleric doesnt have to chain remedy. That's just crazy. Why am I sitting on the ground when I'm supposed to be dealing damage? And I don't even have CFs, I'm just using a tranquil staff. I can't imagine how much sleep time I would get with CFs.<P>3) When I'm in an enchanterless group in Sebilis (which is almost always :/) we rely on feign splitting pulls. It gets very annoying when I have to /q out regularly because I split off something from a roamer which then roamed halfway around Sebilis aggroing everything in it's path. It's fun sitting there feigning 35 times in a row and all, but then most of the time one of them still remembers you, and 2 minutes after you stand back up you get the cool SuperDeathTrain(tm). It would be nice if feigning 5 times in a row or something was a guaranteed mem blur. Perhaps some new really slow ability that mem blurs 100% of the time....<P>Sset the Frustrated, 52 Iksar Disciple<BR>Tholuxe Paells</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OK item number 1, and this is the biggist one: With SoV monks have taken a very serious hit to their desirablity in groups.  They no longer hav a niche which they fill in a group since their ability to pull was nerfed with this new mob behavior of always staying together and backing off together.  Monks do NOT out-damage warriors like they are supposed to. Even with a Knuckle Duster (which was only able to get through great difficulty)  I am outdamaged by many many warriors or equivalent level.<BR>This is very upseting to a lot of monks.<P><BR>Monks should be able to use their fists effectively at higher levels (even without the <P>epic weapon) that is supposed to be one of the appealing things about being a monk. <P>Monks should have a LOT more equipment.  We are quite frankly, screwed in this area.<BR>Monks are not supposed to be dependant on equipment.. and in the early game this works out fine... but it is TOTALLY out of whack late in the game.  With the new mobs in SoV, Plainer armor does NOT cut it. Monk plainer armor was not really that great to begin with compared to what the other melee classes got...<P>Monks are generally VERY poor. We almost never loot. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE realize this and <P>keep items that we need out of the hands of greedy farmers.  Monks can not cart out FS <P>weapons to sell. Monks can not walk out of the dungeon after 3 days of living in it with <P>400pp like other classes can.  We have a great deal of trouble if we win a rare drop that <P>is not light and have to take it out with us. Going to the bank from a popular dungeon <P>takes HOURS.<BR>I realize there has already been some improvement in this area. Thank you. And thank you <P>for getting rid of the Ebay farmers.<P>PLEASE give us an option to automatically not loot copper and silver, maybe even gold. <P>Have them either drop or get destroyed. Or don't put them on mobs higher than 30 to begin <P>with! We do loot occasionly.  There are rare occasions that we can manage to venture out <P>with 12 weight, hoping to earn that 100pp needed to buy a 10 Sow potion or something.<P>Monks are COMPLETELY at the mercy of caster mobs.  I understand casters should be harder <P>that normal mobs, but as it stands now, casters obliterate monks. To begin with the odds <P>are stacked against us since it is VERY hard to find resist gear that is light enough for <P>us to wear.  Even with decent resists, a green mob has an excellent chance of making <P>mincemeat out of a monk.  Take a level 45 monk to guk and try to kill a 32nd level frog <P>wizard with a damage shield on.  As if the shile dwere not enough, the nukes will still <P>land for moderate damage.<BR>It can be VERY  hard to time our Fegin Death between caster nukes, *especially*  with the <P>chain casting mobs.  And if there is semi-bad lag, forget it, we don't get the casting <P>messages in time and it is impossible.<BR>If we turn a corner and bump into 2 casters at once, we are pretty much dead dead dead.<BR>Wasn't one of the main points of a monk supposed to be that we were ok wearing barely anything but cloth?  Wasn't equipment not supposed to matter?  Monks should get a natural resist bonus similar to their AC bonus.  I'll lunderstand if you have to make it so that it goes down if we carry too much weight, but at least make it feasible for us to adventure around without carting around resist gear like the warriors do.<P>I'd also like to point out that resistances were not as important in the early days of Everquest when monks where being designed.  In fact, before level 30 they are barely of importance, it is not until you start to reach the higher levels and particularly the new world areas that they become so vital.<P><BR>Flying Kick hitting for 3 points. I'm pretty sure I speak for every monk out there when i <P>say "Do soemthing to the numbers, ANYTHING, just don't make us land a flying kick for <P>3!!!"  it is embarassing, and we get laughed at by everyone... even the rangers.<P>Fix Feign Death already! It is a known bug that Feign death will not work when in a group and others are hitting the mob.  <P>Raster of Guk.  You know part of what I'm going to say already... he is too rare a spawn.  <P>You knew he was boarderline too rare to begin with.  But it's even worse with the server <P>crowding... AND ONE MORE CRITICAL FACTOR!!!  Monks that have completed their epic quest <P>are going back and doing Raster *AGAIN* because they want to get another RotWF.  Even <P>worse, almost every monk who ever even simply *INTENDS* to do his epic quest is recamping <P>Raster in anticipation of loosing their robe and needing another.<BR>This has for all intents and purposes *DOUBLED* the demand for Raster.  Note I say the <P>demand, not the actual camping. Everyone wants to recamp him again, though thankfully not <P>all do, I'd say maybe 60% actually take the trouble to go back there. It is getting to the <P>point where there is a line to get to kill him. Please increase the spawn rate! It was bad <P>enough before the double camping started.<P>Could we please get a message to the client when we attempt to Feign Death, even when we <P>are succesful?<P>Filters: "Others hits against others" is not specific enough a filter.  We need one for <P>"mobs hits against others" and "players hits against others".  It is very often too much <P>to look at all the combat spam going on, but we sually still want to see who the mob is <P>hitting, even though we do not care about the other players hitting it.<P>Human vs. Iksar monks.  I think humans get shortchanged quite a bit over here.  I really don't know how you will balance it, but I really feel SOMETHING should be done.<P>Defensive skills.  They are not high enough to deal with the new mobs in SoV.  They are so powerful that we are torn apart almost as fast as a wizard who opens a fight with an ice comet (bet they wish they had FD when they do that :-) I saw a wizard once try that because he thought he could nail it in one shot... he was wrong... I don't think he'll try that a second time.  But I digress)<BR>These new mobs kill a wizard in 1.5 rounds of quad attacking for 300. They kill a monk in 2.0  THe monk lasts exactly 0.5 a round longer because he has a few extra hp.<BR>Please readjust the our defensive skills, or raise our AC, or do whatever it takes so that  we do not become the toejam of these mobs.  We may not get hit as much as a wrrior, but we ARE still a melee class and need to be able to take a hit or or 2.<P><BR>That whole "a well equiped monk should be able to outdamamage..etc"  this is NOT correct.  The equipment a monk has to get to improve his damage is astronomically harder to get than the same for a warrior, we have almost no choice in what to wear<P>"Monks are good innately or because of their equipment": please choose one and stick with it.  As it stands right now monks can NOT deal damage as well as a warrior even when they DO have good equipment. And that good equipment is rare and hoarded by by players who sell it to twink monks.  It looks very much like monks were intended to work <BR>I would personally prefer that we be good just by virtue of our skills. That was the point of the monk class to begin with.<P>Make Instill Doubt do something useful against non-greens and/or At least fix it so it doesn't bug out Flying kick when both are used!  It is known that sometimes when you are instilling your flying kick ability stops working completely for a minute or so after you've tried to ID.<P>Monks are very much the semi-hybrids of the game, instead of getting a cross with a caster though, we seem to be very much a rogue/warrior hybrid.  Please examine our combat abilities closely, in may ways we got the worst of both worlds.. damage of a warrior, defense of a rogue but with even worse armor!  Please at least give us more rogue skills. Not backstab that's very unmonkish. But what about maybe disarming traps? Or being immune to traps would be even cooler.<P>Stop making friggin weapons for monks that weigh 10 pounds! Sheesh!<P>And for that matter, it is REALLY annoying to see monk only items that weight more than 0.1  and there are quite a few out there... like oh I don't know.. TREANT FISTS?!?!?<P>You know that move Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon? We need to be able to do everything they did in that movie. This is very important!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor:<P>Here are my suggestions.<P>Raise the defensive skill caps, I believe block, dodge and riposte are all capped at the 230 range.<P>Block is a unique monk skill, and how about giving us a little bonus - that block can block direct damage spells, like a (level/2)% chance?<P>Some monk weapons are very heavy compared to our soft weight limit.  For example - both Tranquil Staff and Peacebringer are 10 stones.  While the weight limit gets raised at 55 and 60, it benefits only a few.

</FONT><HR>well, what can monks contribute to a group? since feign pulling isn't in the vision, what does that leave? mend and feign death (feign death w/o feign pulling) don't help the group in any significant amount (mend to heal 25% every 6 minutes? doesn't help the healer save mana that much) in a group, monks do approximately the same damage as a warrior, but have half the hit points. feign death for retrieving corpes means the group wasn't 'strong' enough. w/o feign pulling, a monk can only contribute damage to a group, and since a warrior can ocntribute basically the same damage, and they have more hit points, why would anyone choose a monk?<BR>that rant aside, neat things i'd like to see:<BR>Mend: at skills 100+, give it a chance to heal any disease/poison on the monk (expelling toxins or whatever) since currently, once its above 100, its the same no matter what skill level.<BR>Resists: A monk is a master of his body. why does he only get a bonus to fire resist? IMHO, a monk trains to endure fire, cold, poison and disease (note, i didn't mention magic, which is the bane of monks anyways. stupid chain casting green mobs...)<BR>Damage: Minimum damage on specials. Flying Kick for 3 at lvl 59 is kinda pathetic. added 'features' to specials at certain skill levels.<BR>Racial Balance: not gonna make me popular saying this, but the 'balance' between human and iksars was the hand to hand delay difference. with the epic, thats gone. with the 'uber' weapons, thats gone. is there ANY reason now to play a human monk besides roleplay?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>DAMAGE INCREASE<P>Flying Kick:<P>This is going to be first as it is the most necessary.<P>PROBLEM:  Special Attacks were included to enhance the overall damage capacity of the class.  Unfortunately, do to the random number generator used to calculate damage, more often than not, the overall damage done with this attack is less than that attained through the use of Hand to Hand, One Hand Blunt, or Two Hand Blunt methods.<P>SOLUTION:  Enhance the overall damage capacity of this attack through the use of a MINIMUM and MAXIMUM damage output.<P>I have worked on the numbers here and the best solution I can come up with is this:<P>MINIMUM:	lvl/2 (If not acceptable, lvl/3)<BR>MAXIMUM:	(lvl x 2)+10<P>I can understand the point of having the minimum damage set at 3 but only at the beginning of the learning process.  As one continues to learn the skill, the chance of the grazing attack should be limited OR it should get to the point where although the grazing attacks do exist, they’re precise enough to do considerable damage to indicate his/her growing prowess in the art.  This minimum damage would exist as a hard cap thus meaning that although STRENGTH and ATTACK modifiers exist, they will not and cannot be added to the minimum.  <P>You will also notice that I have included a maximum.  The reasoning behind this that 1) it shows us as being willing to give something up to gain something and 2) I did a poll of the monks 51-60 and the highest Flying Kick that was reported was a 149 and that was with a max STR and the epic ATK bonus.  So, the max hard cap does not affect us in the slightest.  This maximum damage would exist as a hard cap thus meaning that although STRENGTH and ATTACK modifiers exist, they will not and cannot be added to the maximum in order to exceed this value.<P>Another point that needs to be added here is that the AVERAGE needs to be rescaled and have a better probability of reaching the average needs to be applied.  I, at the level of 51, find that I rarely, like Raster rare, ever hit triple digits…maybe once per real life day if that much.  I also find that I hit the minimum or 30 and below to the minimum around 75% of the time.  I generally punch for more than I kick and very rarely match or exceed that supposed average.  Something needs to be done to address this.  The whole intention of a special ability is to add to the overall damage output.  And although our specials do indeed do that, the time we sacrifice in-between the cycle time on Flying kick by no means equals the efficiency of the attack.<P>I also suggest that something along these lines be looked at for the other special attacks of this class.<P>Disciplines:<P>PROBLEM:  These special attacks came about as an answer to the casters new found power with Kunark.  And though they do indeed increase our ability as massive damage dealers, there are ways of making them more efficient and desired to the community without unbalancing the class itself.  As it stands, the bulk of the monk community only use 3 or the given Disciplines.<P>THUNDERKICK (52)<P>This discipline can be improved via two different options.<P>Option A:<P>Delete this as a discipline and add it as an ability once the player achieves level 51.  This would be added to the ability list much like Triple Attack for warriors and Double Backstab for the rogues.  A check would be made every time the player successfully makes a Flying Kick skill check.  Upon doing so, the player would have a percent chance (suggest 15-20%) to have that attack as a THUNDEROUS KICK.  This ability would act much like a warrior’s Critical/crippling attacks but with an increased percent chance due to the long recycle time and inaccuracy of the attack.  This is perceived as a balanced method as warriors have access to very fast weapons when compared to Flying Kick and therefore have an opportunity to attack more often.  Thus, the higher percent chance of scoring a Thunderous Kick is balanced.  Higher Percent vs. More Attacks.  As above, a minimum and maximum value would be added to the attack to ensure the full usefulness of the ability.  (see below)  Also, it will be necessary to rescale the average damage output of this ability as was done with the proposed changes suggested to Flying Kick above.<P>MINIMUM:	Level<BR>MAXIMUM:	(Level x 3)+20<P>This is considered to be the most acceptable option as it gives the player a better sense of accomplishment upon reaching the higher levels and it adds to the abilities of the player which ceased after exceeding level 35.  Also, with the damage MINIMUM, it allows us to be able to do something special and have it actually affect our damage output instead of landing a Thunderous kick for 10 which we can already do withough this ability.<P>Option B:<BR>Give this discipline a 14 second duration so as to allow for multiple Thunderous Kicks thereby making the discipline more worthwhile.  As above, a minimum and maximum value would be added to the attack to ensure the full usefulness of the ability.  (see below)  Also, it will be necessary to rescale the average damage output of this ability as was done with the proposed changes suggested to Flying Kick above.<P>MINIMUM:	Level<BR>MAXIMUM:	(Level x 3)+20<P>STONE STANCE (51)<P>In order to balance the addition of receiving Thunderous Kick as an ability at level 51, I suggest moving Stone Stance to level 52.  This change will only affect a small proportion of the monk players as it only constitutes a change in skills/abilities for one level.  This is also deemed balancing as the other two melee classes do not receive disciplines until level 52.<P>ASHEN HAND (59)<P>This ability increases the damage substantially on the next successful Eagle Strike.  It also provides the chance to kill the target outright.  Duration = Instant.  Recycle Time = 72 minutes.<P>PROBLEM:  Ashen Hand requires the use of Eagle Strike, the lower version of Dragon Punch.<P>SOLUTION:  I suggest that the attack be changed to Dragon Punch.  The reason being as there is little to no difference between these two attacks besides the over all damage that each can obtain.  Most players practice in Flying Kick and Dragon Punch only and this requires the training of a much lesser skill for use in a discipline gained only by the highest of all players.  Though you may think that this may cause problems with SILENT FIST, it will not as that is also having possible changes made to it.  Another reason for no longer using Eagle Strike is when a monk continues his or his path, he excels in the arts they have been taught.  Upon reaching a new level or training, he/she leaves behind the old ways an effort to attain perfection through new training.  Continued training in the old forms only serve to slow down the training of other skills, especially ones that mirror each other (Eagle Strike and Dragon Punch) so much.<P>SILENT FIST (60)<P>This ability increases the damage substantially on the next successful Dragon Punch.  It also provides the chance to stun the target.  <BR>Duration = Instant.  Recycle Time = 30 minutes<P>PROBLEM:  This discipline increases the damage of Dragon Punch and also gives a chance to stun.  There are too many classes that can already stun and have that ability as a major class characteristic.  This stun is also resistable and totally resisted by Gods and Dragons.  Plus, it does not increase our damage capability as a whole.<P>SOLUTION:  I suggest that this discipline be changed in its form.  The ability to stun a target at level 60, especially when that attack can be resisted and does not work on either dragons or gods, is insignificant.  It is especially insignificant when there are so many other classes in the game that can stun and have a much higher chance to do so and can do so much more quickly.  Therefore, I suggest the following change:<P>SILENT FIST (60)<P>When using this discipline, the monk will land all possible attacks, including all double attacks, special maneuvers, and dual wields (if possible).  These attacks cannot be blocked, dodged, parried or reposted.<BR>Duration = 12 seconds.  Recycle time = 45 minutes.<P>This upgraded discipline not only goes along with the actual name of the ability, but also will focus on exactly what a monk is…a damage machine.  Taking into account the 106% max haste cap on monks at level 60, 14 seconds for a level 60 monk with the epic and maximum haste is an eternity when considering that all attacks will land no matter what the MOB is doing.  This of course should not take into account the new MOB disciplines that came out with Vellious.<P>Hand To Hand Post 50:<P>PROBLEM:  The epic quest is not in everyone’s reach no matter how many friends you have in EQ.  Whether it be due to the lack of desire to level to that point or the inability or desire to get the epic, that portion of the monk community cannot be left standing alone.  <P>SOLUTION:  The following upgrades seem reasonable seeing as there are comparable weapons already in the game:<P>HUMAN		IKSAR<P>50:  14/30		50:  14/31<BR>55:  15/28		55:  15/29<BR>60:  16/26		60:  16/27<P>This is deemed as necessary as monks were originally created to be Hand to Hand masters. Since the influx of weapons, it has changed that Hand to Hand is no longer the best way.  By changing the damage codes on 50+ fists, you give those monks that achieve these levels a choice as to how the monk wants to fight.  Should he or she spend their bank accounts last copper piece on the fancy new weapon being sold by their friend or stick to their fists.  It gives the monk community better flexability and helps balance the Epic Monks vs Non-Epic Monks.<P>Stun Attack and Interrupting Caster MOBs:<P>I am against the ability to STUN being added to our abilities.  There are too many classes with the ability to stun.  We need to discard the desire for STUN and rather focus having our Special attacks a chance to interrupt casters.  The ability to stun only makes us overpowered when you consider our ability to fear and feign whereas an ability to damage and interrupt makes us more efficient.  Plus, the ability to stun is considered to one of the main abilities of Warriors.  That said, the need to be able to interrupt casters is a must.  As you said in your entry statement Alan, a monk is somewhere between the PURE DAMAGE and the PURE TANK.  In that haze of what we are, there is still the need to pull both sides of that job.  All too often in groups is there the lack of that tank/meat shield and we monks have to fill in.  And all too often have groups met their end due to casters running rampant.  The ability to interrup, especially when you consider the ability of NPC Casters to continue their casting is as high as it is, the addition of interrupts on monk specials fits in and is a very balancing addition.<P>Off Hand Damage Bonus:<P>PROBLEM:  Monks are masters of Hand to Hand damage yet still require weapons to reach the maximum damage capability.<P>SOLUTION:  I have long fought for this to be added to the monk abilities.  Monks are the masters of Hand to Hand combat.  We begin the game with DUAL WIELD and cap at a much higher level than any other class.  It seems natural that we masters of that skill would be as proficient in one hand as we are in the other.  Due to this, an equal damage bonus applied to each hand, FOR HAND TO HAND ONLY!!!, seems necessary to continue our edge as damage dealers.  It also makes sense due to game play issues.  But please make sure that you understand this is for Hand to Hand skill only.  If applied to weapons also, this would greatly scue the overall performance of this class and thus throw total game balance off.<P>SKILL IMPROVEMENTS<P>Feign Death<P>PROBLEM:  Feign Death was put into the game as an escape ability.  For years, monks have used this ability to pull MOBs in singles which Verant has stated that they are 100% against.  Due to this, many changes have come about in this skill and have basically distorted the entire idea behind the skill.  As it stands, whenever a successful skill check is made, it lowers the monk on the MOBs’ hate list.  There is a percent chance that the MOB will forget the monk entirely.  This percent chance is higher for static mobs than it is for wanderers.  The problem is, many of the zones that Verant has created is full of wanderers.  This is especially difficult in dungeons and areas where pathing is not what it should be. Verant has admitted that there are several pathing errors throughout the game.  <P>SOLUTION:  One possible suggestion to fix this is to apply the same percent chance to “evade” a static mob to the wanderers.  By doing this, it greatly increases the chance for a monk to live using this escape tactic.<P>PROBLEM:  A problem that also exists with this ability is that although it does indeed lower the monk on the target’s hate list, it does not always wipe from the list enough for the mob to cease aggro even though the monk has succeeded in his/her skill check.  <P>SOLUTION:  Add a message that pops up when the mob is either not convinced of your “death” whether it be a melee or a caster MOB much like with a Rogues "Hide" skill.  Even though it is not hard to recognize that they don’t believe you when they continue to cast and/or beat on you, it would be nice to have a more advanced warning.<P>PROBLEM:  Finally, a bug exists in Feign Death in which when you use the skill and try to get up quickly, whether due to a failed skill or an interrupted “death”, you are unable to move unless you sit down for a second and then stand up.  This will not fix the problem if you sit down and are hit and forced to stand up.  The player must sit and stand on his own in order to be able to move again.  This bug has accounted for several of my characters lives and is very annoying.  I doubt that this was part of the master plan when this skill was added to the list.<P>SOLUTION:  Just remove that bug please.<P>MEND<P>I very much like the idea of adding the ability to possibly remove the effects of Poison or Disease once you reach a higher level with this skill.  In the description for Monks, it was written that monks have such great control of their bodies that they are able, through deep meditation, to heal their wounds.  I would like to have this feature taken a bit further once the skill continues to increase.  I propose the following:<P>Skill 101-125:  3-5%<BR>Skill 126-150:  6-8%<BR>Skill 151-175:  9-11%<BR>Skill 176-199:  12-14%<BR>Skill 200:  15%<P>The percentages would, of course, increase by 1% and be spread out across the ranges given.  I would think that having the chances of success this low is probably a good thing as there are several healer type classes that can dismiss poison.<P>MISCELLANEOUS<P>Celestial Fists/Robe of The Whistling Fists<P>PROBLEM:  Something needs to be done about the stacking problems with these two items.  When grouped with a high level Enchanter/Shaman, we can obtain much faster means of haste through spells.  But in using these spells, we no longer gain the benefit of the other boosts on the songs.  At one point in time, the Robe of The Whistling Fists’ AC and Strength portions of the song stacked with haste spells.  This is no longer the case.  The ATK and AC boosts from Celestial Tranquility, the epic song, do not stack with stack with haste spells either.  This is a gross mistake UNLESS this is the price we pay for having such an awesome item.<P>SOLUTION:  Allow for non-comparable buffs to stack with these songs.  For instance, if "Swift Like the Wind" was given to a monk with the epic, the highest haste buff would rule, as in any other haste vs. haste situation, but the ATK and AC bonuses would still stack.<P>Also, a graphic for the hands portion of the epic is greatly desired by those that have the epic and those that are working on attaining it.  Something as simple as hand wraps would work even though something like black chain, as seen on the Gauntlets of Fiery Might, would be considered preferred.<P>Armor and AC<P>PROBLEM:  I have spoken with many of the monk community and I have heard the same thing over and over again, "We need more AC."  I agree that in many respects, the monk class loses out AC when compared to other classes.  I will also agree that there are many pieces of armor that we have, Crescent Armor from Dalnir is screaming more AC, need improvement.<P>SOLUTION:  Increase our innate AC modifier.  Below is how the multiplier exists now and how it can and should be improved.<P>Existing AC Multiplier:  x1.55<BR>Proposed AC Multiplier:  x1.75<P>This proposed list by no means negates the need to look at the overall AC of our limited armor items.  It simply is an alternative as several other classes, including rogues, paladins, and shadow knights, can attain a higher AC than us even though they, rogue withstanding, are not considered to be pure melee classes.  Sometimes it is easier to fix the problem once the project is complete than it is to start from the beginning.<P>Quests and Miscellaneous Content<P>MORE CONTENT!  We desire more content.  I personally would like to be able to obtain the black headband and black sash from the monk masters.  Whether is be a quest which results in despawning each master and having them come back in another form, like in our epic quest, and requiring us to defeat them one on one or having to search for something and return it in order to become true masters, they are definitely desired.<P>We humans want to be able to quest for the Iksar Shackles and eventually the Whistling Fist if it indeed does exist.  As it stands, we human monks can gain enough faction to get into Cabillis and receive the quest but because no quest exists to be able to obtain the first shackle, we are forced to created iksar mules.  Then, we cannot wear what which we obtain.  And on top of it all, some of the shackles require no drop foraged items.  I suggest implementing a small quest, possible bringing in the heads of 4 newly created Sarnaks and/or Goblins in order to prove our worth to the Court of Pain, so as to gain the Shackle of Dust.  Then by changing the foraged items so as they're no longer NO DROP, maybe NO RENT instead, we can continue the quest and eventually obtain the Shackle of Steel and maybe even the Whistly Fist, if it is indeed a real quest.<P>I ask for more of the components of the headbands and sashes be changed to no drop.  None of these components require a skill such as foraging to obtain so they are easily gotten through hard work and grouping.  I also feel that the sashes and headbands themselves be changed to NO DROP is necessary.  It is not in the best interest of the game or the monk community to allow the selling of quest items.  This only promotes the abuse of a loop hole in Iksar faction and also abuses the player economy.<P>So far, everything that has been mentioned has only benefited the 50+ monk community.  I would like to make a suggestion for the 1-49 monks.  Something DRASTIC needs to be done to the AC and STATS on the headbands/sashes received from the NPC monks in Qeynos and Free Port.  These are required components in the eventual prize that is our EPIC.  Everything, from the Robe of the Lost Circle to the Robe of the Whistlying Fists to the Epic has been wonderful.  And yet the headbands and sashes fail to carry the load on stats or AC.  Suggestions to follow:<P>White Sash/Headband:  1ac, +1 STR/STA/AGI/CHA<BR>                      +1 to all resists<P>Yellos Sash/Headband:  2ac, +2 STR/STA/AGI/INT<BR>                      +2 to all resists<P>Orange Sash/Headband:  4 ac, +3 STR/STA/AGI/WIS<BR>                       +3 to all resists<P>Red Sash/Headband:  6ac, +4 all stats<BR>                    +4 to all resists<P>Purple Headband:  8ac, +5 to all stats<BR>                  +5 to all resists<P>Even the last of the quests are easily obtained by level 30.  These modifications allow those monks to at least be proud to wear this equipment and know that is it of some use.  There is better equipment that can be obtained just as easily, but as parts of a larger EPIC quest, these are at least acceptable to wear.<P>These are the ideas of one person with the backing of many like me.  I hope that I have put forth something worthwhile and easily understandable.  I can tell you that you will hear much more of the same as these are the general conscensus of the monk community.  Than you for your time.<P>NYOG THA<BR>Desciple:  Brell Serillis Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi Absor and thank you for starting this topic!<P>Monk damage dealing ability should be adjusted to fall squarely between warrior and rogue damage.  Adjusting Flying Kick damage and adding Double Flying Kick both seem quite reasonable means of accomplishing this.<P>Human monks should have quests similar to the Iksar shackles.  Sashes and headbands are usable by Iksar, however nobody would want to use them given their meager game effect compared to even cured silk sash or headband.  Alternately, make the shackles human-wearable and remove the need to multi-quest the starting shackle by killing some mid-level critter.<P>Feign Death should give a message when a monster has frenzied and will continue to attack.<P>Feign Death will automatically fail when a monk is in a short passage.  The game logic restores the character to crouching posture when insufficient headroom is available.<P>AC on planar, quest, and other monk armors should be adjusted to levels where this equipment becomes usable.  Crescent should have AC at least on par with Cured Silk.  Shiverback should have 2+ higher AC than Cured Silk for all pieces.<P>The availability of yew leaves in Wakening Land for making black pantherskin armor for monks should be greatly increased.  The risk involved in searching this zone for ground spawned items should be more than sufficient to limit the availability of these leaves.<P>Black pantherskin should have a weight of no greater than 0.5 for tunic and leggings.  If twinking is an issue with this armor then make it No Drop so only monks capable of hunting this zone can make it.<P>Add monk-only items to Venril Sathir and Trakanon's loot tables.<P>Decrease the weight of the Collar of Neshika from 1.5 to 0.2 or 0.1.<P>Decrease the weight of Treant Fists to 0.2 or 0.1 or otherwise adjust them to make them more desirable than the tradeable and far more easily obtained Gem Enlaid(?) Gauntlets.<P>"Sit" is still displayed on the Sit/Stand button while Feigning Death.  Hitting "Sit" will cancel Feign Death and stand the character up, yet the PC will freeze momentarily (a sizeable part of a second).  Please change the sit button to read "Stand" during a Feign.  Also, fix the momentary freeze-up after standing.<P>Make thunderkick a more desirable discipline by either increasing damage or by allowing multiple thunderkicks to land over a short period of time.  Apply minimum damage of the monk's level to these kicks.  "Leewei has landed a Thunderous Kick (24)!" is laughable.  Adding a sound effect a la spellcasting would be neat here.<P>Make 100 Blows a desirable discipline.  As it stands, this "haste buff" only adds a few hundred points of melee damage, even with a good weapon.  At the level it is obtained, this is negligible.<P>Make Disarm a useful skill in higher levels.<P>Make Instill Doubt a useful skill in higher levels.<P>Make Safe Fall a useful skill in higher levels.  Specifically, allow a chance of ignoring 10k falling.<P>Finally, last but not least, increase Alcohol Tolerance to 252 to allow us to become Drunken Masters.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One additions I like is making some questable items, like Paladins quest from Brilliant Sword of Faith unto eventually the Fiery Defender.<P>Make the Treant Fists a further quest. Like 5 of them in total? Make them like a wuss-version of Celestial Fists, they modify your H2H damage ratio, getting better and better per upgrade.<P>Add more sash quests. Make the highest have a haste.<P>Add more headband quests. Make the highest have _____. Maybe Ultravision or See invis? Wouldn't be GREAT, but it'd be nice.<P>Make Flying Kicks post-55 a ?stun?<P>Thunderkick is.. sad. Make it double damage.<P>Monk 2hblunt weapons are ridiculously heavy. I understand if a war/mnk weapon would have heavy weight, because warriors would use it too. But you would imagine a Tranquil Staff, monk ONLY, would be made just for THEM, therefore it'd be light? If I was a weaponscrafter, and made monk only weapons weigh 10 lbs, no one would buy them. :P<P>That pretty much sums it up, if I had to choose the most important one, I'd say a new rung of quests that have to do with headbands/sashes/Treant Fists.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The following is a post I made on Ashek's old monk thread. It asks for quite a bit, but have a look anyways:<P>------------<P>One thing I wish happened in the post-50 game was for all the monk specials to evolve. Instead we got one-shot disciplines. Here's what I would have liked to see:<P>Kick becomes MultiKick - As the name implies, launches a barrage of kicks. Actual number of kicks is random, so it has a chance of being highly damaging or highly pathetic.<P>Round Kick becomes Tornado Kick - An AoE attack that effects all enemies in melee range.<P>Tiger Claw becomes Concussion Strike - Has a chance to clear you of the mob's hate list.<P>Eagle Strike becomes Ashen Hand - Same as discipline. Has a chance of insta-killing opponents Lv.45 or under.<P>Dragon Punch becomes Silent Fist - Same as discipline. Has a chance to stun.<P>Flying Kick becomes Thunderkick - Not the same as the discipline. Has a chance of inflicting an AC debuff on the target (shocks them).<P>All evolved specials will have their damage amounts increased accordingly, of course. New animations and maybe even some particle effects are a must. Not only does this give our utility a HUGE boost, it'll increase our coolness factor tenfold.<P>------------<P>Okay, hopeless dreams aside here is a list of what I would like to see done.<P>- Being as general as possible, a Warrior has the potential to do 60dmg/sec and a Rogue can do nearly 100dmg/sec. I feel Monks should be dead smack in the middle with a realistic potential of 80dmg/sec. As it stands we're round about 68dmg/sec. I feel my suggestion on evolving special attacks as stated above can help widen the gap between us and Warriors.<P>- I feel Monks should have the HP of a Rogue and the AC of a Warrior. We've always had the HP of a Rogue and before Kunark we've had the AC of a Warrior thanks to that generous lead in our Defense skill cap. How about giving us AC on par with the Warriors again? Don't say we don't need it.<P>- Feign Death. Please, look at it. It really should be more reliable than it is (which it isn't, at least in the late game). A message indicating whether or not the mem wipe component was successful would be a big help as well.<P>- Instill Doubt is good, but it could be better.<P>- More fist dmg/dly altering gloves if it's possible? Would be an excellent way to spice up those Treant Fists as someone already pointed out.<P>If I can think of anything else, I'll let you know.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, if you see the responses, you'll notice all to most are about monks damage and agro.  <P>"DAMAGE" - You have said it yourself, monks don't have the armor of warriors.  Then we should at least be doing more damage than a warrior.  Our damages come close with us doing a bit more.  But it's not as dramatic as the rogues damage.  I'm not saying we monks should do more damage than rogues, but we should be able to clearly see more damage out-put than warriors regularly.  (disc are nice but ashenhand every 72 min?  I'm talking about damage between monks and warriors without disc).  Some people suggested tripple attack, that would be hella nice but that soudns a bit over powering.  WHAT I WOULD LOVE to see you do as do many others monks is let us combo our punch special attacks and kick special attacks.  It's going to increase our damage but not make it as powerful as the monk at level 55 double BSing for 500damage each.  !Example! would be "FLYING KICK" and "DRAGON PUNCH" will be seperate and can be used seperatly but "DRAGON PUNCH" wouldn't be able to be used with "EAGLE STRIKE" simultanious.  It's also common sense punch is punch and kick is kick, both seperate.  This will also look very cool  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>"AGRO" - Obviously make FD work like the rogue's evade to lower our agro from the mob, monks can't take serious damage.  Once again I'm going to say you said it yourself, we don't have the armor of warriors.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I want to give credit to the person who collated all this information, Bodi Kibadachi of the Bristlebane server. He has dome a lot of hard work over the last few weeks putting this all together with the help of the monk community, it is bad luck that this thread was created at a time when he is fast asleep in bed, so I am posting it in his stead.<P>---<P>This post has been compiled from a very large thread from Zadkiel Hopeseeker's Monkly-Business website. The majority of this post was originally written by Kaiele Katarn&lt;, of the Innoruuk Server. <P>The main issue that Monks currently face is dealing damage in the end game. Prior to Kunark, and the changes in the melee skill caps, we were ahead of all other classes in dealing melee damage with the exception of a backstabbing rogue (which is as it should be). <P>Since our damage was based on our higher skill caps, and those skill caps were raised for all other melee classes with the Kunark expansion, the gap has closed dramatically. Damage dealing is the only potential a monk adds to a group, especially due to changes in the way the Feign Death skill works, and mobs' reactions to Feign Death. <P>Currently, a monk offers very little to a group due to the changes in damage. A warrior has higher hitpoints, higher AC, and higher magic resistance -- and thanks to the loss of a skill cap advantage for monks and new, extremely high ratio Velious and Kunark weapons for warriors, monks no longer have a clear advantage in dealing damage over a warrior. <P>Because the skill caps cannot be raised for monks to re-establish damage potential from that side due to programming issues, we would like to propose the following changes for the monk class.<P>DAMAGE INCREASE<P>1) Some type of upgrade to damage output.<BR>Rogues are incredibly powerful when they are behind a mob. Warriors are incredible tanks. Monk damage -- either with an "uber" staff or with epic fists -- should be halfway between a rogue's potential when the rogue is behind a mob using a Ragebringer and a warrior who is attacking with his/her best weapons. Keep in mind 10/16 and 13/20 weapons for warriors when rebalancing our damage. There are many ways to tune this damage, but PLEASE do not resort to another UBER-rare staff that will only balance the 1% of the monk population lucky enough to get one of these drops.<P>2) Raise fist damage post-50 for those without epics.<BR>While the delay continues to drop, the damage never increases once a monk hits level 50. Very few monks use fists anymore, but this would make the RP'ers and casual players a tad more viable near the end-game, if they ever get there. <P>3a) Encourage usage and training of lesser monk special attacks.<BR>Either allow us to use one type of strike and one type of kick at the same time by unhooking the special attack re-use timers post-50, or give the possibility of attack "strings". (This is the preferred solution, but would be harder to implement.) If a monk successfully uses Flying Kick on an enemy -- connects for damage -- then give a chance (based on Double Attack skill, preferably) for the monk to automatically use Dragon Punch/Tail Rake. If Dragon Punch/Tail Rake connects for damage, give a slightly lesser chance of doing an Eagle Strike. This is not only an interesting solution, it would make raising all of the monk special attack skills more important. This would be a post-50 enchancement, or when a monk reaches 200 skill in Flying Kick.<P>--- If this is technically not reasonable from a coding standpoint, then a secondary option would be: <P>3b) Minimum damage on Flying Kick.<BR>It won't make a huge difference in our damage output, but it will at least make us FEEL better. There is nothing worse than doing a flying kick for 3 damage as a post-50 monk. Even making this minimum damage cap post-50 only would be an improvement, and would not unbalance the pre-50 game where monks did have an advantage.<P>Damage Increase Suggestions:<P>To recap, a level 50's fist is a 14/30 weapon, which reduces (in delay only) to 14/26 at level 60. One suggestion is to have the damage increase (as it does for the rest of the levels) post 50 as well, so that a Monks fist at 60 is 16/26.<P>One of the best suggestions that has come from the many Monks is to have the main hand damage bonus applied to the off hand.<P>This is becasue Monks are the masters of Duel-Wield. We get it as a level 1 skill, and gain 7 points per level, capping faster and higher than any other class. This indicates a natural affinity for the monk to use his off-hand, a kind of natural/trained ambidexterity.<P>Allowing us to strike just as hard with the off-hand as the primary will solve the damage-dealing problem and bring us up to the correct damage level of being between warriors and rogues.<P>If this change is made, you will need to remove MNK as a class capable of using the moss-covered twig, a weapon changed to be off-hand only because of the large amount of damage it does when a damage bonus is applied.<P>Other suggestions on ways to increase damage include having a minimum damage of level/2 for special attacks such as Flying Kick, or add some kind of level damage bonus to the special attacks, but the off hand damage bonus is the most favoured solution.<P>4) Improve Feign Death.<BR>Leave it as it currently functions in all but two areas -- If the monk is not removed from the mob's haste list and does not get a "has fallen to the ground" message, give the monk an automatic "Evade"-type effect. In other words, allow a monk to sacrifice a couple of combat rounds to lower him- or herself on the hate list. This would DRAMATICALLY increase monk survival rates on uber-mobs, when we're causing intense aggro with epic fists or other high end weapons. It also provides a check to ensure that monk damage is not overly high, if Verant is still worried about that. Finally, since this is linked to a SKILL, it still has a chance to fail, just like a rogue's evade skill. Also, fix the "no failure message, but the mob just keeps beating on me after the eighteenth feign attempt in a row" problem that I and many other monks have encountered in the post-50 world, especially while grouped in Velious.<P>One possible suggestion was to have something like "%T has seen through your ruse" when a Mob attacks after a succesful feign, simalar to the fact that Rogues know when they have sneaked succesfully, and another for resisted Spells not breaking Feign.<P>5) Fix the Celestial Fist effect.<BR>Celestial Tranquility is a great effect on our epic, but it stacks with almost NOTHING. Most monks rarely solo post-50, and most common group buffs will keep the effect from working. (Call of Earth, enchanter haste spells, most bard songs, Speed of the Shissar, etc.) At least alter it so that even if the haste is not usable due to other, better buffs then the additional effects -- the extra +AC and +ATK -- will stack anyway, similar to the way the Robe of the Whistling Fists worked. It's pretty bad when a well-meaning ranger tosses me Call of Earth and costs me 54ATK and 12AC. The ranger buff especially does not make sense because Call of Earth is NOT a Haste Buff, and the Celestial Tranquility Effect will indeed stack with the upgrade, Strength of Earth.<P>Also the Celestial Fists wearers, felt that a graphic for the hands would be better than the hand wraps.<P>6) Increase Warrior, Paladin, and ShadowKnight taunting skills.<BR>Yes, I know this isn't an enhancement to MONKS, but it would DEFINITELY help us out. WE ARE NOT TANKS. Unfortunately, it's very hard to taunt off of us due to our extreme aggro, ESPECIALLY with our low-damage, low-delay epic fists. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE implement this one change if you don't make any other!!<P>7) At least consider spreading the weight limit increase out over the post-50 levels.<BR>Few monks will make 55. Even fewer will make 60. Therefore, weight increases at those two points are not terribly useful. A 2lb increase every other level (i.e., 52, 54, 56, etc) would result in a weight limit of 24 at 60. A 1lb increase every post-50 level would be another way to implement the changes, and would also result in a weight limit of 24 at level 60. If these are "too much" of a weight increase (the current max weight limit at 60 is 22lbs, from four-pound increases at 55 and 60) then skip levels 55 and 60, when we get our passive enhancements of +1 HP per tick while feigned.<P>The following are additional information gathered from other Monks posts, covering Skills, Disciplines, Armour and Quests.<P>SKILLS<P>Mend.<BR>Perhaps Mend at a skill of 201+ can have a small chance of curing disease/poison. The increase chance to cure will rise as the skill goes above 201+.<P>Skill Caps.<BR>Kick caps at 250. So why does Flying kick, eagle strike, and dragon punch all cap at 230?<P>Also, it was recently announced that they upped the caps for the Hand to Hand skill to equal 1hb/2hb, but all that was raised was the 60 cap, the 50 cap is still only 225 compared with 1hb/2hb cap of 240, so the 50 cap needs to be increased to 240 as well.<P>Higher Dodge, Riposte & Block.<BR>This is a concern for high level Monks in regards to the Big Game Hunts. <P>With higher skills in these areas, this would give Monks a unique way to tank better - Plate classes absorb damage with their higher hps, Rogues use stealth (evade) to not get hit, and monks just flat out use speed (block/dodge/riposte) to make the mob miss them. <P>Either increase the 3 skills from there current caps of 225/230 to 252, or have higher percentage chances of working (if that is not taken into consideration with a higher skill)<P>DISCIPLINES<P>Thunderkick<BR>This needs to be worked on, as currently it is being reported that 24 damage comes up the majority of the time. Possible suggestions include it becoming an innate or a timed discipline where every kick within the disciplines duration can be a thunderkick, {b} the minimum damage on TK to be 1 to 1.5 * level, (so a 60th level Monk will not kick for less than 60-90 damage with it), {c} add a short stun to Thunderkick, or {d} make TK a special attack after flying kick, gained at 50+th level or so.<P>These suggestions assume that the damage is not based from the FK damage table, and flying kick is not improved in any of the above afore mentioned ways.<BR> <BR>We would like all the disciplines to receive an increase in length, and looking at the new hybrid disciplines, no one else has every discipline last for short periods of time.<P>ARMOUR<P>Monk armour needs some natural AC progression. It would be nice to see all cresent pieces (obtainable at around level 30) being 1 point more AC then cured silk (obtained at level 15) shiverback (obtained at 46+) being 1-2 AC greater than cresent, and Velious quest armour (obtained at level 50+) being 1-2 greater than shiverback. Each piece should have a higher AC than the same piece of the previous type. <P>Also, why does our equipment seem to have less (overall) in stats, resists, and clickable effects then other melee classes?<P>Leggings<BR>Cured - AC5<BR>Crescent - AC3 +stats +svs<BR>Shiver - AC5 +stats +svs<BR>Velious - AC6 +stats + svs +hp +Effect<BR>Black Panther - AC8 +stats<BR>Other - Gators AC 7 +stats, +hp<BR> <BR>Arms<BR>Cured - AC4<BR>Crescent - AC3 +stats +hp <BR>Shiver - AC5 +stats<BR>Velious - AC7 +stats, svs, hps <BR>Black Panther - AC7 +stats, svs<BR>Other - Azures AC 12<P>Bracer<BR>Cured AC3<BR>Crescent - NONE<BR>Shiver - AC4 +stats, +svs <BR>Velious - AC6 +stats, +svs, +effect <BR>Black Panther AC6 +stats, +hp <BR>Other - Vox AC 7<P>Gloves<BR>Cured - AC4<BR>Crescent - AC3 +stats +svs<BR>Shiver - AC5 +stats, +effect, +svs<BR>Velious - AC10 +svs, +stats, +hps<BR>Black Panther - AC7 +stats <BR>Other - Treants AC 8 <BR>    <BR>This table refers to a selection of our armour, and the other column is what a normal 35th to 40th level Human Monk currently wears. As noted, these MONK ONLY pieces do not have any kind of progression AC wise, which ultimately is one of the main things ppl look for. <P>As shown, Crescent has a lower AC than Cured, Blank Panther armour, which is Tailored (admittedly at high skill) is mostly better than Velious armour. <P>If Shiverback AC was raised to the AC level of the Black Panther armour, and the Velious armour AC rasied to that beyond Black Panther, I think that the vast majority of Monks would be very pleased. You will NOT increase a Monks AC, only make Monks want to wear their own armour.<P>To clarify, NOT ONE MONK is asking for more AC on pieces than we are already wearing, simply the AC of Monk only armour to be brought in line. If Velious sleeves had an AC of 10, they would be worn by many Monks over the Azure Sleeves they have worn for the past 30+ levels.<P>MONK QUESTS<P>Treant Fists.<BR>Make them have a slight effect (whether attack raised by 1 to 10, a small self only heal or even an effect like summoning bandages), or alter the stats enough to make the Monks of that level want to do the (35hr average long) quest, rather than the all to easy Gem Inlaid Guantlets, which provides a very simalar quest result in a fraction of the time.<P>The Collar of Neshika.<BR>The Collar itself is to heavy, and the weight needs to be greatly reduced from 1.5, perhaps down to 0.2, and adding one AC, would make the quest worth completing (and wearing over a Undead Collar)<P>Iksar Quests<BR>I belive their final quest (whistling Fist?) is still unfinished, and needs to be looked into.<P>This post does not cover everything, and as mentioned is compiled from many to help you decide what we think is required. Monks upto level 50, we believe are balanced, and it really is the end game (50 to 60th) that things need to be addressed.<P>---<P>Posted on behalf of the monk community at www.monkly-business.com<P>Zadkiel Hopeseeker</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One major thing:  Minimum damage on special attacks.  3 damage flying kicks are embarassing.  This also ties in with disciplines such as thunder kick.<P>Feign Death is fine, the challenge at higher levels is that higher level mobs are "smarter" and dont fall for your feign death as easily as the lower level ones.  It may be too extreme with the mobs in velious, from what I'm hearing.<P>Another big thing would be the miss percentage on fists.  For how slow they are compared to easily obtainable weapons, it makes your fists pretty much out of the question as far as major damage goes.

</FONT><HR>The problem facing monks is that we have lost our role.<P>We used to be the melee damage dealer in a group, but that has been handed to the rogues.  Not only are rogues great damage dealers, but they also server some very important grouping skills (picklock, disarm trap).  You guys have done a wonderfull job with the rogue making them a specialist in the group.<P>Now its monks turn.<P>Problem #1 damage and damage avioidance.<BR>----------------------------------------<P>We are a hybrid melee. We cannot do damage like a rogue, and cannot tank like a warrior. In the 50+ game, we cannot be main tanks, things just hit to hard, and we do not have the hitpoints to survive.<P>Now here is the dilema. Already, (even thou we dont do much more damage than a warrior) we can out taunt warriors.  Given the meatshield+complete heal style of play that dominates the upper game, out taunting the warrior is BAD!  If you were to just up our damage, It just makes this problem worse.<P>We have no damage mitigation skill. FD used to drop us on the aggro list hardly, hardly ever works in a group. When a mob is beating you for 200+ points, you have one chance for fd to clear your aggro (which honestly doesnt seem to work in groups at the 50+ game) or you die.<P>Giving us additional damage without some sort of damage mitigation skill just signs our death.<P>My solution: <BR>------------<BR>Up our damage by adding a minimum damage to flying kick (or one of the dozen other good ideas on how to improve our damage, other than tripple attack).<BR>and either, give us an evade type skill, or add a damage mitigation component to fd. (i.e. it may wipe your amount of hate 100%, but only clear you from the hate list 1/3rd of hte time).<P>Problem #2: The death of feign death<BR>------------------------------------<P>To me, this is the big issue. Basically, since the big "nerf" of fd, changes have been added to the game that basically make this a worthless skill at higher levels.  The way mobs react via the coding in "the hole" and "sov" make feign death usless for pulling. <P>In addition, since kunark came out, people have noticed that feign is seen through more and more when the monk is down below 2 bubbles of health. This is a situation where the monk has successfully met the skill check (no "fallen" message), no spell was cast on the monk since they fd'ed, but the mob keeps pounding away.  In the monk community this is refered often to as the "frenzy code". When a mob decides that they are going to kill you, they will kill you regardless. I personally have had times where I fd 8 or 9 times successfully in a row, but still have the mob continue to beat on me.  Feign at above 2 bubbles of health, and this HARDLY happens.<P>So, at higher levels fd is useless as an escape tactic.<P>If its not used to pull, not used to mitigate damage, and not used to escape a bad situation, what is it used for? mostly, to shake off greens you dont want to fight while running through a zone.<P>My solution: Make us a specialist again<BR>---------------------------------------<BR>your not going to like this (or at least verant wont). But big V has to swallow their pride, and understand that they designed a game where "pulling" happens.  Anyone can pull, but up to lvl 50, the monk was the best. post 50, were not even close, save a few rare occurances (like the plane of hate).<P>There is no reason why the only form of crowd control should not be mez. The benifit a monk brings to a group is a) good damage and b)the ability to limit what you fight. Call it "proactive crowd control".<P>Were the guys in the movies that go out, throw a rock, get one guards attention, and makes the encounter many on one, instead of many on many.  Even in a large scale, "doing a dungeon" style raid, you pull to your group, then you move the group up. This is how it happens. period.  If you give the monk the skills to do this better than others, we will once again have a group wanted specialty.<P>Personally I prefer to feign pull. Its what I've done for 2 years.  For some reason verant "doesnt like it". I say, swallow your pride, admit you designed a pulling game, and give us the tools to pull.<P>a) revert the hole and sov so that mobs train back instead of walking back at the same time<BR>b) increase the fd skill significatly (post 50 I should not be getting the "fallen" message as much as I do.<BR>c) post 50, spells that hit us after we feign, or at least aoe spells) should NOT break feign. Yes we can take the damage, dot, etc..but it should not break the feign.<BR>d) give us a short reuse disicipline that will clear our aggro 100%. Seem overpowering? not at all, we can already do this, its called /q. remember your downtime thread? having a monk /q to clear aggro is just silly. with /q and the mages coh, there is no reason not to have this.<P>Personally I dont care about damage. I want to be the monk I was up to lvl 50. Im a puller. I risk death every single time to help my party. Dont take take that away from us.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I'll be discussing some balance issues as well as possible fixes that I and many others have noticed recently with the implimentation of many new aspects of high end level gameplay and many new npc changes.<P>Issue 1. High level tanking.<P>Monks tank with the ability to live through 1, and sometimes 2 rounds of melee combat, the same as rogues, and even pure casters<BR>To me, this is unbalanced, as monks are supposed to be the second best tankers out there being the middle man of pure melee.<P>Directly in relation to tanking ability comes the factor of who will be primary target of these mobs.<BR>It will always be monks in the beginning of fights due to their slightly better melee output and lack of a hate list reducer.<BR>Feign is no longer an option as it used to be against lower level mobs, so should a monk do what they are designed to do, which is a litle more damage output, their going to die right away and no healer will be able to keep them alive....hence they have contributed nothing other than what damage they could muster before they died, which won't be much.<P>Monks need a way to counter their higher damage over warriors in order to be a viable class at end levels.<BR>Feign used to be a reliable hate list reducer, which would essentially void their extra damage, and make them a weak warrior in every aspect who has feign. While feign is nice to have, in end game, it doesn't help us not be a worthless class in a fight.<BR>Much like all the magic based classes who are upset over high resistance rates on uber mobs, monks usefulness drops drastically, with the exception that monks have no additional benefits to offer a group as casters do.<P>This is the main problem with monks. We need to be able to live and be of some use.<BR>A dead monk is a useless monk.<BR>Thats the only option to a monk right now if we do intend to be part of a fight, and what fun is not being of any use at all? The games about fun right?<P>Now also, we say monks have mend. great skill, but it cannot be buffed, it cannot be healed, it cannot be relied on when being hit for 700dmg a pop. it's a great downtime killer, and way to make the menial hunting a tad bit safer, but it like feign helps in no way in these specific encounters.<P>So, what needs to be done about this issue?<BR>Monks need something that can help them be a viable group member in these specific encounters.<BR>A hate list reducer that doesn't require them to stop fighting, and one that works.<P>My first thought on this was a discipline that reduced agro in pulses over a period of time.<BR>My second thought was giving monks more hp than rogues at the end levels, they are after all supposed to be beter tanks.<BR>My third thought was to give monks an evade type skill, but they already have feign, it just doesn't work in these scenarios.<P>true monks have disciplines that can let them live a second longer...voiddance, stonestance, and whirlwind, but if they click a discipline like that on, the only way to live afterwards is to back off and stop attacking...once again they lose their damage advantage...and then once they enter melee again they will die and have no escape.<P>So again, how do we balance these situations that the high level charecters find themselves wanting to stick to once they have done it all?<P>1. Hitpoints. Thats an advantage that benefits all high level monks in every situation, and I don't think it's a viable addition, when it's mainly one area that needs work.<P>2. A discipline. While I love the idea of a pulsing hate list reducer, it would have to be a long duration to be of any use, and worthy of being used against only the toughest of mobs.<P>3. A new evade type skill. Who wants to add another skill? monks have alot as it is, would it be more of in the way or a blessing? up to you to decide.<P>This concludes my high level tanking issue.<P><BR>My other problem is that of damage output. With the implimentation of all the new weapons useable by warriors, monks lose their edge because we have gained nothing new.<BR>What to do?<BR>We could put in more monk weapons, yes, and make warriors even more jealous, or we could do something invisible like adding a damage bonus to flying kick based on the attainability of the warrior useable weapons that take away the edge.<BR>Flying kick used ot be balanced back when weapons weren't so powerful, but now they put flying kick way down there. Plus this would also go along with verants (monks are great naked fighters) I gag everytime I hear that btw, monks just don't do naked raids, it's like a thorn in the classes side holding us back from being viable in the areas we do actually play in.<P>So, the damage issue?<P>1. Add in some weapons to give us back our edge.<BR>2. Toss in a damage bonus to the hand to hand offhand.<BR>3. make flying kick have a damage bonus at 55, and then again at 60. Not something big like a 50 point bonus, thats silly...something like 10 damage at 55 and 20 at 60. Flying kick, with the new weapons out there is a small percentage of our damage, and adding those bonuses would make a very small difference now...back before all the new enhancements, it would of been a huge difference, but not anymore.<P>These two issues are my main concern. The first one being the biggest. Monks just want to play and have fun without being just a speed bump to a mob when we are supposed to be a second rate tank.<BR>As it is now, it's not fun at all.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor, if you take one thing away from this thread, I think most would agree it should be:<P>More damage<P>Nearly as important (if not more for some, case dependent) would be aggro reduction, especially if we get our wish of additional damage.<P>This relates to the 51+ levels only, mainly nearer to 60.  Monks were balanced at 50 when they maintained a skill cap advantage.  The vanishing of the skill cap advantage, along with warriors/rogues gaining additional damage abilities at 55 and 60 as well as weapons very nearly as good as monk weapons (if not better in some cases), led to monks falling behind in the damage curve to where they are now.<P>Even with the small advantage that they have, monks have a hard time dealing with unwanted taunt.  There are 4 classes that get both dual wield and double attack.  These can be thought of as the damage dealing melee classes.  These classes are rogue, ranger, warrior, and monk.  Warriors WANT aggro, as they are also the best tanks.  The other 3 classes do not want aggro when a defensive class is present (mainly warriors).  Rangers and rogues get jolt/evade to offload aggro.  Where does that leave monks?<P>We are in nearly the same sitation as rogues were pre-evade.  The only way for monks to get lower on the hate list is to stop attacking or try to feign death off the hate list.  Reducing attacks to reduce aggro defeats the purpose of having a monk in the group.  We would then be doing warrior damage or lower.<P>Feign death might be an option if it actually worked well as an aggro reducer, especially on high-end mobs.  For example, it is said that feign is just about useless on the velious uber-mobs for aggro reduction.  The result is that monks get unwanted aggro and either die within seconds or soak up healing mana that would be better spent on a warrior.<P>Feign death seems to not work very often as an aggro reducer, especially as the mobs increase in level.  It works fine when I'm by myself, but in a group situation I can feign death multiple times and the mob keeps attacking me.  Each time I feign it costs damage, as auto attack must be turned off first (and if you don't wait for a time before feigning, it will never work...why must there be a delay?).  Even if it DOES work, there's only about a 30% chance it will reduce aggro at all.<P>Given these factors and a 10-second recycle time, feign is not a reliable aggro reducer.  Monks sorely need a way to reduce aggro, especially if we receive a damage increase.  Otherwise it would always be better to add a warrior over us in a group for melee purposes.<P>One note about taunt.  Weapon skill seems to play no part in mob aggro.  This was great when monks had a weapon skill advantage, but now they do not.  The result is that not only do monks not do as much relative damage, but they actually have MORE relative taunt!  I'm not sure this was ever considered.<P>My evidence?  My most striking story is this.  2 monks, both level 56 with tranquil staves.  The only differences were weapon skill and haste.  One monk was at 252 skill (2-handed blunt), the other at about 85.  The monk with 85 skill (me) had 20% more haste than the other monk.  The monk with 252 skill had to do at least 3-4 times the damage I was doing, but I had the mob's attention 100% of the time.  This is when I figured that actual damage done (ie. weapon skill) had no bearing on taunt.  It seems the only factors in generating melee taunt were the number of attacks and the weapon ratings.<P>Even if an aggro-reducer wasn't implemented for monks beyond what we have now, I would hope any kind of damage increase was done in a way that didn't increase aggro (like increasing the minimum damage on flying kick, for instance...for starters   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ).<P>If we are to continue to accumulate aggro with no way of reducing it, then we would like a way to avoid the resulting attacks.  Additional AC/HP is not what many monks are after, nor in the spirit of the class.  Additional damage avoidance abilities would help us and make sense as well.  The caps on block/dodge/riposte could be increased (they're not 252 yet), or perhaps some other method.<P>There are other points I could mention later, but I wanted to state my main balance concerns for now.  Monks should fall closer to the middle of the damage difference between warriors and rogues, not barely more than warriors (unless we were very good tanks, which we're not).  We also need a way to offload aggro without sacrficing any damage advantage we have, or it would just always be better to replace us with a properly equipped warrior for melee.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Im here to post my support behind Bodi's write up, it was posted to monkly-business last week and we have been adding suggestions and tuning it since then, i think i can honestly say it gets to the core of our problem in many areas.  There are lots of other ideas that may give you ideas that people are adding but please look over bodi's post carefully as it probably has the most support of the monks who are monks primarily, and (in most cases) nothing secondary in terms of playing a main character.<P>Verant has, as you have said, never really been comfortable with the idea of a balanced warrior type without good armor, and thus, our role has never been defined in the post 50 game.  The rogues were turned from sneakthief to assassin, the warriors, just improved on there tanking skills.  The monks...well we outdamage the warrior by just enough that we tank, and our ac is still too low to tank effectively.  If we are going to continue this path then please balance our damage output between the warrior and the rogue instead of just making us slightly better at damage output then a warrior. <P>Bodi's post has my full support.<P>Azith<BR>53rd iksar monk of the Nameless<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 9 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052812-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052812.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052812-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052812-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052812-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052812-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052812-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052812-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052812-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052812&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052812&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
