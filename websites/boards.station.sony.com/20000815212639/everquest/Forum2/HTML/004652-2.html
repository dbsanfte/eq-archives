</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;BTW, this maybe shoulda been on the rants board, but perhaps GW will come down and answer this mere mortal....why why why do you create rules that are detrimental to the players? Play nice started off as a way to prevent KSing and verbal abuse. Play nice should not be exploited as a means of allowing everyone the same chance at a spot in line for toilet paper...err...getting xp. <P>The Play Nice Policies were created because a growing number of customers were being subordinated by other, more powerful, groups of players.  These other groups would claim "ownership" of spawns, loot drops, and even entire zones, refusing to allow other people a chance to experience them.  On some servers, guilds had certain areas camped 24x7.  <P>The play nice policies, in regards to spawns and camping, are designed to promote equal access to the areas.  If a group can get into a room, they have as much right to be there as anyone else.  Are the policies perfect? No, of course what is?  No matter what policy we adopt, there will be people who are helped by the policy, and others that are hurt.  Sometimes the policy may help them in one instance and hurt in another.  <P>As I've mentioned in the past, if anyone has any ideas for policies that are easy to understand, are enforcable, do not require a larger CS team than before or after the Play nice policies, and will please everyone, I'd be happy to discuss them.<P>-Gordon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

They also know they have a choice of logging on- walking in and saying, "pnp- let me in rotation" or logging on, wandering around 3 hours, finding everything camped, and then logging out.<P>PNP is specifically put in to allow casual players some way to enjoy the game in the face of people who log on at 6am and play for 15 hours.<P>If you weren't camping things for literally 24 hours straight then perhaps these rules wouldn't be needed.<P>I've never used pnp yet myself- I play about 4-6 hours a day.  But if I only had 3 hours a day I would use it regularly.  Most of the uber folk are going to burn out and not be playing in another 6 months anyway.<P>You are so wrapped up in your uberguild world that you have no empathy for what it is like for people who can't play 10 hours per sitting.<P>Are some folks jerks?  Yes.<BR>Should PNP mean they get the NEXT spawn- No.<P>But PNP should mean- you are here- that means you get next spawn and after that we share.  If a third person walks up, then they can sit and wait for the third spawn.  It sucks but it isn't really the players fault.  Verant is the one who has loaded 1000 person servers to over 2000 people without raising the rate that rare items come into the game.<P>If previously an item entered the game every 8 hours, you had 5 people competing for it, now you have 10.<P>But given that they are letting the servers inflate, the only way to make it fair to casual players is to have PNP.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>G. Llewllyn I'm sorry for lumping you into that cateogry, that wasn't called for and I take it back.  Nevertheless  I still think PnP helps more than it hurts.  <P>I have seen 160 people in South Karana on Veeshan.  I have never invoked PnP on someone, but with the incredible overcrowding and unwillingness to share even common spawns in many areas I see an increasing number of situations where it is justified IMO.  If somene wants to share a spawn with me I will let them, because I know if I don't the poor bastards are likely to wander around for hours and not find a single exp giving mob through no fault of their own, a situation I have been in many times.  I do not really resent someone who invokes PnP under those circumstances.  Either they invoke the rule, or they don't get to hunt anything.  <P>It's kind of like Dante's parable about people who had tons of food and spoons too long to feed themselves starving to death because they wouldn't feed each other.  Most players have a resentful rather compassionate attitude towards letting others share spawns, and as long as this is true PnP will be the official policy so people will have a chance at some exp and otherwise monopolized items.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Sorry, but I like the PnP.<BR>Those who can play 8 hrs a day may disagree with it.  But your $10 and my $10 are the same.  If the 'shared' xp is to slow for one party and they decide to leave, it is not the fault of the other.<BR>Now if the game was designed so that adventuring was more profitable than camping this wouldn't be a problem<P>As for sharing the AC, it has a random chance to drop the items.  Just because you had 8 chances and did not get you ritem does not entitle you to 8 more chances in a row.  You share, 1 spawn, 1 spawn.  I have invoked PnP policies before.  I have ALWAYS asked politely to share. I have even waited when they said they wouldn't be long.  But if they say 20 minutes, then echo that chord EVERY 20 minutes, I will either ask again to share immediately, or inform them that I must petition.  Why?  Beacuse I might be in an area that is camped 3 zones wide on either side.  So, I can spend 30 minutes running to find that fourth zone camped as well.  <P>When someone does a ccamp check, yes I shout that what I am is camped.  If they ask if they may join.  I always reply yes.  <P>Kether<BR>E'ci<P>oh, and I have more guild invites than I can throw a stick at, oh wait paladins can throw....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I have had the so-called "Play Nice" rules used against me three times so far:<P>First was by the (now defunct) überguild Zen Sect trying to steal my group's Frenzy camp.  Zen Sect (ZS) intentionally KS'd my group after the mob was ours as per the rulebook. Many times in front of a Guide and once or twice in front of GM Dartok with no action taken!  Eventually we end up killing the Frenzy ghoul (With them trying to KS) and our enchanter won the sash.<P>Second was when I needed a dragoon dirk from Ambassador DVinn.  A level 26 enchanter named Voidis came up and demanded that I vacate the area because I did not get xp from the mobs.  I broke the tower and throne room with my skeleton pet and proceded to settle into my camping routine.  He even went so far as to cast nullify magic on my pet to remove its buffs (which resulted in the pet attacking him on more than one occasion).  My pet was parked in the tower where Emperor Crush spawns.  After a Guide appeared and issued me *THREE* warnings. 1) I didn't move my pet (wtf?) 2) I "KS'D" Crush after it attacked my groupmate first. 3) I did not follow the guide's decision on how the spawn would work.  I protested and to no avail.<P>Third is when a Druid and Magician were KSing me while I was camping the guards in west commonlands.  After they KS'd me three times I logged in my 44 wizard and proceded to take the kills that were mine i.e., the ones that I attacked first.  The Guide issued ME the warning for defending my spawn that I nearly died breaking.<P>After being completely ****ed over by the so-called "Play Nice" rules I've made it my project to make everyone's day that much more misserable by using these rules on them to get what I want...<P>...until I realized how retarded using rules like this to get what I wanted is.  I actually respect someone's right to hold a camp for as long as they can, after all: They were there first.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Gordo i don't get it, you say that no one has "rights" to a item, i'm behind you 100% on that yet why do players have "rights" to a spawn?<P>You have said that its not servers over populated just zones that means that there is enough for everyone to kill so if something is camped they can go someplace else.  This is also true places like sol a najena upper guk rarly have more than 10 people.  (sol a and upper are over 10 if there was a train in sol b or lower) najena has more now that *something* is dropping there.<P>So why do plays have rights to spawns?<P>I would seriously like to know this.  When i ask if i could get in a group/rotate and the group or person says no then i say fine.  I have never petitioned them or persued them further (other than asking them to tell me when they are done and wishing them good luck).  Many of the people i know and am friends with are also like this.<P>The rest of the PnP is fine people shouldn't walk around swearing with every other word training ksing or any of that.

</FONT><HR>I agreed with the poster above me.  Yup, PNP is great when it comes to player conducts, such as the use of Profanity, purposeful training, Blatant KS'ing (though a highly subjective subject).  But it utterly fails in regards to forced spawn rotation.<P>You wanted an idea?  Remove the forced rotation part of PNP, that's so easily used in situation where patience would allow fair access to that spawn.<P>I have played EQ since Beta, and NEVER have I not been able to find "somewhere" to hunt.  What PNP is delivering is a service to those "impatient, "demanding" types that want that spawn (item) and they want it NOW!  And they don't want to be told, get to the back of the line buddy, I was here first.  They want to find broken spawns, and take advantage of othes work/sacrifice...simple as that.<P>NEVER have I found myself without any options in hunting.  NEVER.  But yes, sometimes the spawn that I preferred to have was occupied by someone else at the time I wanted it.  So what.  That's life, I'll find another place to hunt.<P>Suggestion:  Do away with forced spawn rotation.  Put the control and emphasis on true sharing and patience back on the players shoulders.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>No-Drop Lore is one solution.  For PnP to work effectively so both parties can get exp and loot, the rare drop on the desired NPC could drop twice in a row.  In accordance with PnP policy if both parties are alternating spawns when the rare loot drops both parties involved will have a fair shot at the loot instead of one group winning the lucky random drop roll and the other group being stuck at the camp waiting for the loot another 10 hours.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well Gordon, IMO the randomized loot of the New World has gone a long way in helping that sort of thing out.<P>And no, if MasterOfQuests says "Go to Guk and find me the part of the broken sword I seek." will I mind at all.  I think that solution is much better than 'a part of the broken sword has a 10% chance of being on this one mob which spawns every 6 hours.' - that would encourage us to 'do the dungeon' and end much of the need for PnP.<P>Then you would see instead people slaughtering stuff - people would want to hold rooms instead of spawns (just for a rally point more than anything as which spawns they have are unimportant)...<P>That's my discussion on it.<P>Thoughts?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I think what everyone seems to be missing is that PnP has not really done anything. Most players ignore it and continue to use the older ways on camps. I see this when im in various zones ie Cazic Thule or Sol B someone walks in and yells camp check and get a ooc or shout reply of whats camped and say thanks. People still wait to get into groups and spawn drops are still rotated usually by the /random method.Players really are smarter than verant and most on this board give them credit for and really are capable of self policing with micro management by the creators really being unecessary. <P>The fact of the matter is that PnP really isnt needed in 95% of the situations that are being discussed and the 5% it is used someone is usually just forcing their way in with it. As long as there are 8 hour drops or more for an item *that* will be the problem more than anything else regardless if its the ring from AC or a fang from the butler or maid. You cant have items drop that rarely and there NOT be a problem period. I have been here since beta and more than anything else I have seen is that players are very capable of policing themselves.<P>Mistress Sareena Blades<BR>Warrior of the Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Thankfully I have never had these types of experiences.  I was in Lake Rathe by the arena zone, binding and buffing ppl.  I am a lvl 20 cleric.  I went there to solo the Arena aviak guards, because it's VERY easy to get one, and difficult to get both (i've never had both come at once.)  Anyway, a druid and shaman were sharing it.  I sat down behind the shaman medding, and he told me that I could have the spawn.  Didn't ask for it, he just said I could have it.  I often see people asking for a camp check, and I've never seen a problem.  If someone had asked me to share the spawn, I would have.<BR>It's hard to solo even blue guards, as I usually end up with 20% or less mana.<P>Some people are just jerks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Abashi, you're using a blanket rule to correct a specific problem, and that's where the PnP rules fail. The PnP rules DO create more problems than they fix. <P>The rule should read: Groups and guilds who camp a spawn site in order to monopolize it for extended and unreasonable amounts of time will be required to leave the spawn site and let others have it. If they continue to violate this rule, said guild can be banned from the site for a week (month, whatever). <P>That would perfectly correct the extended camping problem without hamstringing legitimate campers. I feel that it is wrong to make a group move on after breaking a spawn cycle. <P>I've had it happen where newcomers arrive at a spawn site and DEMAND access to the site, even though our group has spent an hour breaking the spawn so that we can hunt there without an utter catastrophe happening every thirty seconds. People who work to secure spawn sites should have an opportunity to enjoy it for a little while, not be forced out by someone taking advantage of the situation. <P>Guilds, as noted above, often use the PnP rules to THEIR advantage by forcing other campers out. Usually, however, it's just one lone pain in the neck who wants all the benefits and none of the work. In one of my husband's parties, a necromancer decided to leave the group, telling the group that he JUST left that they could have "every other spawn" because he was invoking the PnP rules. So they let him have the spawn. THE WHOLE SPAWN. ;&gt; Needless to say, he did a lot of corpse running for a while. That's a very popular tactic amongst groups who've been unfairly made to share spawns. I've seen that more than once.<P>I don't think PnP really solves anything, as written. I think it only encourages player animosity.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

It's one thing to monopolise a spawn, getting drop after drop after drop... but if you were there first, to get one copy of an item, and you're prepared to stay as long as it takes, you should be the first to walk away with it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I agree with the principals of the PNP although i do not agree that they are a viable solution for EQ.  The problem is there is no consistancy whatsoever from guides if and when you are lucky enough to get one to respond.<P>Gordon wrote:<P>&gt;As I've mentioned in the past, if anyone has any <BR>&gt;ideas for policies that are easy to understand, <BR>&gt;are enforcable, do not require a larger CS team <BR>&gt;than before or after the Play nice policies, and <BR>&gt;will please everyone, I'd be happy to discuss <BR>&gt;them.<P>I do have a much better system requiring dramatically less CS people than the present system, but its not just a sugar coated additive to desguise the lack of flavor, thus it will require some initial code work, but in the end it will make everyone happy.<P>Part A) Spawn tables should be modified so that a greater variety of mobs spawn at each point.  Almost all mobs should wander, then it becomes almost impossible to sit down and and claim a spawn point.  Agro radius should be reduces if the mobs move around.<P>Part B) The first attack on a mob turns his name text to a different and clear colour (flashing yellow or something) to represent that it has been engaged.  From that moment on no player spell or attack will affect that mob unless they are in the same group, or until everyone in that group has zoned or died.  An engaged mob will never agro on anyone else.  You cannot pp from an engaged mob that is not attacking you or the group.  These are all code driven, dont need to wait hours and hours for a CS representitive.<P>Since there is no guarantee what will spawn where or where it will wander to people will not sit in a corridor like a bunch of tourists, they should be exploring and adventuring.  Multiple groups can 'do a dungeon' and not get in eachothers way as much.<P>You might be in LGuk but the Executioner or whatever might keep spawning in different places.  It will still come out in the same frequency but you do not hinder anyone elses chance of engaging the mob if nobody knows where it will show.  You probably have a better chance finding things if your group is on the move.<P>The whole PNP for the sake of camp and spawn rotation only exist because of the nature of the system, which in my opinion could be easily changed.  I think the code enchancment to mobs to eliminate KSing and the like is also another feature that will dramatically reduce demands on guides.<P>Perhaps even something so fundamentaly simple is too complex a change for EQ, i am not sure.  I'd love to see groups just wade through a dungeon slaying whatever comes by without the clinical stopwatch approach to dungeons.  It has turned the game very dry and stale and has infested it with these camping and spawn issues because of its pedictability.<P>Let chaos rule supreme, and have fun.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Play Nice Rules look great on paper.  Here is a little story I would like to tell . . .<P>Myself (30th druid) and a 31st Shammy friend were sitting in Guk camping the Mutant Fungus one afternoon.  We were happy as clams (don't know why, cause nothing was dropping).  Along comes a member of Uber Guild X.  Said member states that she was on the "list" for the spawn.<P>Confused, my Shammy friend and I boggle at each other and tell the Uber Member (47th druid) she is more than welcome to share the spawn with us.  She moaned for a while, complaining about the "list" and how it was her spawn, but she did take her turn in killing the Mutant Fungus.<P>Fast forward a few spawn pops . . . I notice the room is starting to slowly fill up.  Hmmm . . . I see alot of Uber Guild Tags surrounding me and my Shammy friend.  Here is where the Play Nice Rules go out the window.<P>Well after their numbers had grown to about 20, the Uber Guild says that it is their spawn because of the "list."  Ok, time to call a GM in, I figure the GM will help solve the problem.<P>Yeap, GM showed up.  After about a hour with the GM being there, the Uber Guild had convinced the GM that according to the Play Nice Rules, EACH AND EVERY Uber Guild Member should have the opportunity to share the spawn!!!!!<P>There are now 20 Uber Guild Members in the room, each getting a turn at a 15 minute spawn.  You do the math.  Needless to say, my Shammy friend and I had no other choice but to be chased away by an Uber Guild and the PLay Nice Rules that were meant to combat the Uber Guilds.  Go figure.<P>Love to hear you comments.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I agree with you egodonor.  The PnP has been exploited I don't know how many times.  When does it stop?  Lets say group A is camping spawn A.  Group B wants to camp spawn A as well.  Groups C and D want in on the action too.  Now for sake of arguement, lets say spawn A is only 1 mob.  Do all 4 groups have to share the 1 mob spawn according to PnP?  The Icy Orc spawn in everfrost is 5 mobs.  Does that mean a group that has been there for 3 hours must give up a mob to each guy that comes along wanting to camp there?  Maybe next time there is a raid on hate every uber guild on the server can go and split the spawns evenly.  I'm sure that would go over well.  i can't belive all you people are supporting the distorted entity that the PnP has become.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Gordon says  "The Play Nice Policies were created because a growing number of customers were being subordinated by other, more powerful, groups of players. These other groups would claim 'ownership' of spawns, loot drops, and even entire zones, refusing to allow other people a chance to experience them. On some servers, guilds had certain areas camped 24x7."<P>Well this didn't help the ECI server.  Zones like the planes are still "owned" by guilds.   Camps are still "owned" by guilds or higher lvls.  I don't think the GM's on ECI know what the place nice rules are for.  I have a suggestion, anybody planning to goto ECI should think it out emensly.  As soon as you get to the higher lvls, good luck in finding someone in the "guild" that "owns" the planes to allow you in to play.  The only thing the play nice rules have done for this server is help the whiners that are between lvls of 1-16.  After that, good luck.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Not surprising, since it is a "fix" which in this arena does not address the real problem, which is simply a combination of static spawns, an experience/advancement system designed for small cohesive group interaction as opposed to massive disparate individual interaction, and overcrowded servers, boasting at times 2200+ when the game was originally designed to accomodate 1500 or so, if I remember right.<P>And it is the full combination of those three issues which is the real heart of the matter.  Kunark, for example, with it's generally random spawns, works pretty well.  Of course, it's not nearly as crowded either, due to the relatively high barriers to entry such as the wilderness of Firiona Vie.<P>PnP with respect to spawn sharing would likely be a moot point if a) all spawns were random, and b) more spawns were made readily accessible over a larger "area".  Widening the level range of creatures which offered XP might help a little as well, although that opens up other problems.<P>As for the issue of "MasterOfQuests says retrieve the shards of my broken sword from the reavers in East Karana...", and the effect that random spawns would have on that... has any one considered the use of flags?  i.e. if Character A has quest flag 17 set and gets the credit for killing this creature, there is a random chance that this quest item will be part of the treasure.  If not, no chance.  If someone else without the proper quest flag set loots the creature, the item acts like a "duplicate" lore item, and simply cannot be picked up.<P>I'm sure there are exploits and the like which could take advantage of this, and a host of issues with integrating it into the existing code... it's a suggestion to be looked at, nothing more.<P>Thanks for your time...<P>Damiano, EQ Prexus<BR>Tourges, EQ Prexus<BR>Khristoff, AC Leafcull<BR>Tourges, UO Great Lakes<BR>Damiano, The Realm (ret.)<BR>etc....<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Surely other people have had this experience. <P>You know, the casters that park their pets on the spawn sites, refuse to share, but instead offer to sell you a PGT for 250pp? <P>PnP is needed.  Without it lower level characters have NO recourse against high level farmers.<P>Sorry it forces some of you to move off of your uber-loot spots.

</FONT><HR>code_slave, the point i tried to make is that the PnP is doing more harm than good.  It's a tool for those 35 level casters to screw you once again.  Lets say for instance you were camping the pgt first.  then the 2 casters come along and say because of PnP they each get a whack at the spawn.  Now you are just one of 1 turns.  What happens if there are more than 2 casters?  What if there are 10?  you are missing the point here.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Aarrgghh!  Yesterday I logged in in Everfrost hunting icy orcs.  Someone was hunting it (a high level druid PLing a warrior).  So I do something else for a while til she leaves.<P>Great!  I now have this perfect sized camp to my 31st druid & 32nd enchantress, and start in on getting some decent fast exp.  The two of us are perfectly capable of handling the camp alone.<P>Someone else shows up.  I tell him I'm taking the camp quite handily thanks, but he then decides to stick around practicing hand to hand.  About an hour later I feel guilty and ask him to join my party.  Exp slowed, but I felt I had more than lived up to the play nice rules.<P>Two more people show up about 20 minutes later.  They ask to share.  I say no, this place isn't big enough for even the three of us that are here already.  I offer to TP them anywhere they want.<P>No, they want MY camp.  They threaten to petition if I don't share.  So instead of having my exp slow to a disgusting trickle, I leave for less green pastures (where my druid ends up getting killed twice in Penalty level, exactly what I was at the *$#@(*&@#$ orcs to avoid!)<P>THIS is a horrible abuse of the play nice rules.  It ONLY makes sense for rare loot camps, NOT for exp camps.  At exp camps it becomes a tool for people to steal the camp from the person who is there already, WHO WAITED FOR AN HOUR FOR THE PERSON BEFORE THEM TO LEAVE.<P>Disgusted in Norrath,<BR>Vivid Dreamings, 32nd Enchantress, Hand of Mana officer, Craftsmistress, and Linguist on Nameless<BR>Tylendell Ashkevron, 31st Druid (almost 30th again, thanks to last night)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hi All,<P>First of all I must admit that ive been playing this game only for a few weeks and Ive read all of this. I must say that in my time here 2 times people have threatened using the PnP, tho I had no idea what it was so I ignored it. Anyways, as stated in most of the previous postings it is correct that these persons who use PnP are pretty much abusing it.   <P>When I meet a taken spawn I ask if there is any room, if not, I ask them to tell me if it gets available and I check in once in a while, unless I find another spawn.  The ones keeping the spawn are happy, Im happy since im on a list while looking for another spawn. I have respect for those having a spawn and will always do.  I also believe that most of these people abusing this PnP rule is less than 20 in RL age.<P>If someone ever asks me to share a spawn due to a petition, They may have it but Not until Ive had a discussion with the GM, and they cannot expect any help if things mess up.<P>Also These all previous posts are posted by Users, it would be nice to see what Verant has in store on this since it seems to be a quite big issue bugging alot of people.<P>Andraken</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>&lt;&lt;As I've mentioned in the past, if anyone has any ideas for policies that are easy to understand, are enforcable, do not require a larger CS team than before or after the Play nice policies, and will please everyone, I'd be happy to discuss them.&gt;&gt;<P>The part of the PNP that I think gets overlooked by CS is this:  "Note: A "group" in this case is defined as a party of one or more characters that are united in a common belief or goal and are capable of completing that goal."  This directly addresses the issue of "my group broke a spawn that the person invoking PNP couldn't have broken, they are riding our coattails," and seems often not to get enough attention from the CS rep receiving the PNP petition.<P>I think when a CS person receives a petition requesting that the shared spawn rule be applied, the CS person should seriously focus on whether the petitioner is "capable of completing that goal."  NOT with the room/camp already broken, but when it ISN'T broken -- and if there's any doubt, even going to the extent of repopping the room/spawn (or waiting for it to if code doesn't permit actively making it happen) and asking the would-be sharer to demonstrate their "capability."<P>If they can do it fine... but if they can't or refuse to make the effort, no sharing.  A lot of folks can hold a spawn if it's already broken, but aren't capable of breaking it themselves for a few more levels.  Of course, the CS rep would then have to /kill the spares so the original group that broke the spawn isn't penalized.<P>Not a cure-all, especially for single spawns like AC.  And you would still have the folks who resent having to share at all... but at least it would remove the resentment factor arising when the person asking to share wasn't capable of breaking the spawn themselves, and is truly "taking advantage" of other players' work/risk.  And simply being informed that in order to share, you are going to have to handle a fully-popped room will discourage this tactic going forward -- for the true abusers, therefore, this should only take once or twice for them to knock it off.<P>In addition, you could avoid the add-on CS involvement described in a post up above when a share was enforced, the would-be sharer couldn't handle it and died, and re-petitioned because they didn't get "help."<P>Just my 2 cp.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004652-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004652.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004652-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004652&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004652&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
