</FONT><HR>It seems that most people who say monks are balanced till level 50 are already past level 50.  I am a level 18 human monk and I can tell you things are not balanced at lower levels.  In almost every group I'm in of similar level there are people who have weapons that far exceed what my fists can do.  A weight reducing bag is not an option I can even dream of obtaining at this level.  Yet how do I get the money to purchase decent weapons or a bag when I can't carry the weight to loot?  A single bronze weapon I loot puts me over my weight limitation.  Also, unless everyone in the group agrees to turn off auto-split I am overwhelmed with small coins.<BR>People my levels are using CDS and PGT's, what equivalent weapons can I procure at my level, certainly not my fists?  And what weapons I can get weigh too much for me to carry! A shamon friend I hunt with has higher AC and almost the same HP as me and a full line of spells, where's the balance?  <BR>Don't get me wrong I like my character, but it seems that monks don't have near as much to offer a group as they should.  We can't sow or track or heal others, we're not the top damage wielders.  I have had many groups say they were really looking for a pure melee type like a warrior when they're advertising for someone to join their group.  I don't like being called a manna drain.  <BR>This is my first character so maybe I just don't know enough yet.  But, I have to ask, if at level 18 we get out hit by rogues and warriors with their better weapons why would anyone want a monk in their group?  <BR>If Verants thought is that at level 60 it all balances out, what good is that?  How many people are at level 60 compared to levels 1-50?  I don't want to spend a year to catch up with other classes, and from what I reading here it sounds like it's not even balanced then.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The color is wonderful and Yak has our eternal gratitude, however, a full suit of this stuff wieghts 14.1 which is simply to heavy to wear for combat.  Its also currently to hard to tailor, although that maybe fixed as us tailors figure out an easier way to get our skill level past the 115 it is now.

</FONT><HR>I would really like to have feign death lower you on the hate list.  Currently, many many times in groups when I feign the mobs just keep beating on me.  Thus feign can no long save my life like it is supposed to.  <P>Feign currently should temporarily remove you from a mobs hate list, while you are feigned.  Once you get up you have a small chance to mem wipe the mob and be completely removed from the hate list.  However, in groups feign is seen through far too often.  This is a problem.  <P>I will feign during a battle and the mob will stay on me even though I get no "you have fallen to the ground" message.  Once this happens it is pretty unlikely that the mob will ever stop hitting me no matter how many times I feign.  I can do this at 80% health or 10% health and it doesn't really matter.<P>Feign was changed so that mobs wouldn't always forget you once you feigned.  Basically they wanted this to save a monks life and not be used for splitting mobs with little risk.  This is not how feign works anymore.  It very rarely saves a monks life during a battle.  Infact it almost never does.<P>To change this I would like to have feign lower the monk down the hate list of mobs every time you get a successful feign.  Even if a mob saw through a successfull feign this should move us down the hate list and the mob would begin attacking the person that is now at the top of the hate list.  This would allow us to use feign to save our lives once more.  <P>Feign should still have the normal chance to memwipe mobs etc.  <P>Moving down the hate list should be more reliable than a rogues evade.  Moving down the hate list should be more challenging for a rogue because if they are successful they can do insane amounts of damage.  Monks don't need to move down the hate list to deal their damage.  As such getting down a mobs hate list should be easier than a rogue getting dropped down the hate list.<P>Doing this would make a monk much more survivable on raid level encounters and would not have any global impacts on balance.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My 2cp....<P>My main concern is weight and armor as i am only 30. <BR>  I really wouldnt mind the 14 stone thing if we could just loot more cash! How about a mid level quest for a monk only wallet? It would automatically change all cash to plat when looted...or maybe just after get up to 10gp. Trying to make any money is very hard as a monk becuase after about 30 gp i get very close to over 14 stones. This means i am constantly bugging people in groups to bank for me  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> I know monks dont need as much as some other classes, but many of our great weapons, tink bags, ect are very very expensive.<BR>  Also some of the monk only armor has ridiculus( im sure spelled wrong) wieght. For example panther and treant fists. The stats on crecent also are not that great for being monk only...I would rather have other things in almost every slot  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> I also feel that iksar shackle quest rewards are not up to par for the trouble. They wiegh too much for the ac and still not as good as Vox bracers. For example i just spent a week getting shackle of rock (would have taken far longer if i didnt have many friends to help). I was very dissapointed to see that it had same stats as shackle of stone which only took about a day.<BR>  One thing that would help wieght issue is if we( iksar) werent forced to use weapons. Please look into increasing our fist dmg/delay.<BR>  Last thing is Instill Doubt. I practice this skill all day everytime I play. It is now 40 and has only worked twice on mobs since I got it! Please make it easier to raise skill or something.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, I have read this post from top to bottom, and the most intriging idea is the thought of allowing our abilities to chain in a combo.  This would be a great way to allow us the pleasure of using otherwise worthless moves.  As far as balance issues, as stated in the earlier post, a combination of increased difuculty and slightly less damage would be appropriate, in my opinnion.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Are you guys all nuts!!.There is no way you are going to get any improvment in damage output. VI done tests ages ago on this and said monks outdamage warriors with ease, even though i dont think this accurate. The best thing that could happen is an improvement to Flying Kick to up our average damage in a fight.<BR>So be realistic guys.<P>Me personaly i would like to see an improvent in the percentage of our defensive skills being triggered, just so i could tank a bit better seeing that since Kunark came out we have been turned into second rate tanks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First off I'd like to add my support to Bodhi et al's compilation of suggestions. They are well thought out and presented.<P>I'd also like to suggest that, in lieu of chained special attacks, to simply decouple our special attacks. The main benefit of this change is to increase the monk damage through our existing abilities and restoring the relative damage capacity of monk in comparison to warriors. A side benefit is the re-affirmation of the monk's combat versatility. Let's face it, Scars of Velious has once again created a disparity between monk, rogue and warrior damage, with monks falling by the wayside.<P>From what I've gathered, our special attacks max damages are:<BR>Round Kick, 13<BR>Tiger Claw, 13<BR>Eagle Strike, 25<BR>Dragon Punch, 35.<BR>This adds up to 86 additional damage points over pressing the flying kick button, assuming each and every special attack lands, and each and every special attack attains maximum damage.<P>With this change, and an offhand damage bonus increase for hand to hand combat, would likely retune monk damage inline where it was before SoV.<P>Thanks.<P>-Master Seji Toryu,<BR>The Rathe<BR>"There is no Proon."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I know some of these have been delved into already… but I also know some have not… so if you would please take the time to read this… I think Ive gotten quite a bit to look at. heh<P>The main things monks need to be rebalanced to where they once were... DAMAGE OUTPUT... yes we still do the most dmg head to head in a fight over warriors and rogues... but in a group the rogue will be behind mob backstabbing and not only outdamages us but severely outdamages us. I would also like to point out that the dmg difference in monks to warriors/rangers is not overtly large either... yet monks have drawbacks to being able to do so much dmg where as warriors/rangers/rogues do not. We have to worry about weight ALL the time. We dont get higher ac items like they do. We dont get anywhere near the pick of wpns/armours they do. (at least not seriously for someone who says most blunt wpns are monk usuable..if its weight is over 3.0 its more weight than any monk needs.)<BR>A real quick mention on Celestial Fists… our epic is cool… but it was also designed for Kunark and old world mobs where fights lasted like 2 mins tops…. Now with Velious and sometimes hour long battles… well couldn’t you make the haste a longer term effect… say 3-5 mins instead of 9 seconds… I know you can add it to a hotkey but that can be annoying sometimes… just a thought..<BR>Sometimes the wpn and armour lists look like they are specifically targetting monks. Look at orc fang necklace and earring .. both good melee class items.. but I dont think Ive seen any other earring or necklace that weighs 1.0 besides those.<BR>But if you are satisfied with monk damage then let us have some other abilities to make up for the weight/ac thing. Ideas I have heard include stuns (which would be very neat) Could either be made to stun with special or as a special itself or my favorite would be to have it randomly work in background like dodge and block...randomly emote you strike target in a pressure point temporarily stunning them! After all monks being master of hand2hand should know the pressure points and use them in combat (maybe actually expand that for aimed pressure points for various abilities ex. pressure point leg--snare type effect by weakening leg--pressure point temple--loses casting concentration)(might have an eye rake for blindness)<BR>Another ability monks might have that would not be really extreme is a meditate skill similar to casters...call it trance... monk sits and goes into trance to both purify body of poisons/diseases and to heal itself. Monks are masters of their bodies so not far out of line.. can even balance it a bit with having us see a blank screen in place of casters book. so we cant see things approaching til maybe like lvl 45 or so. or maybe make mend go down in repop time with lvls.<BR>monk only quests on small 100% wt reduction bags to carry food only in. Because food is usually one of the big things that monks carry. or some type of quest for a never ending water/food item.<BR>something neat but I doubt able to do this late in the game would be to have various fighting styles for monks. one for damage at cost of defense. one for defense at cost of damage and speed. one for speed at small cost of dmg and defense. <BR>another thing that would be neat but I doubt we will see is another random attack. after we hit lvl say 20 we could have a small random chance to throw in an elbow or knee.. heh<BR>one thing that has always been seen with monks in any other game I play (and yes I know this is not any other game Im just making suggestions here) would be quivering palm type DOT. (not that i think it will make it but...)<BR>Something I think all monks want to see is flying kick being put on par with rogue backstab. We are best toe to toe and we use flying kick ..they go behind and use backstab... but the difference is that their backstab is minimized for their lvl while our flying kick can do a minimum of 1 dmg. Put flying kick at a minimum of lvl to. This is our main damage special. I believe it warrants the same consideration as the rogue main dmg special.<BR>I would say something about monks irl being masters of all forms of combat not just blunt wpns but that would be to overpowering heh.<BR>Another suggestion Ive heard is that monks get built in speed bonus while walking/running... not up to sow (well maybe not til like 60) Would help with pulling.<BR>I would also like to point out that along with a lower ac/weight than warriors (not sure where we stand ac wise in comparison to rangers/rogues) we also have much lower hp and because we dont have the same str we have lower ATK rating. Maybe think of revamping our hp/ac/atk ratings in comparison with warriors/ranger/rogues. Not sure if this is where you planned it to be but thought Id mention it.<BR>I know this is a long note but I hope youve read the whole thing. These are just some ideas I believe would help monks out a bit. We are very nice as is, but I would like to see monks being the dmg doers we once were compared to everyone else. Or at least allow us some small side things to help stay up with the other melee so that new players will still pick monk because its a viable class.<BR>Thanks for your time<BR>Drakol Dreadfist of The Tribunal Server<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>In response to the 'need for stun' being unsupported i thought i would explain a little. <P>Shaolin monks are the masters of the body which means that they can use the body to many advantages. This also means that they can use their foe's bodies to their advantage. In combat they are know to disable their foe in any way possible. This can be done through various means. e.g. A sharp kick to the side of the knee will disable the opponent temporarily. This can be likened to the 'stun' in eq. <P>Something like this would not over balance the class, it would possibly make soloing remotely viable and also bring our worth back to grouping.<P>Stun may also be implemented so that it is only possible while using fists. There are not enough monks using fists which certainly has been frustrating to be out damaged up to my current lvl by twinks wielding 10k weapons, which completely distracts from using fists. Not that this should be used as a method for stopping twinking, but it certainly would make fists a viable option. <P>Overall i have enjoyed playing a monk, i just feel that it is such a missed oportunity for other enhancements that can relate directly with shaolin monks: <P>1) Specialisation - eg attack, defence, h2h, 1hb etc.<P>2) Meditation - Med so that the body is in a perfect state for combat. e.g possible regen type effect, maybe medding their attack value up which diminishes over a period, until the monk meds again.<P>thanks for your time...<P>Luucas<BR>45 Monk of Druzzil Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've only play a monk a little. I am in agreement with them that they need a way to consistantly disrupt casters. Monks whole body should be a weapon. Here's my thought for a solution.<P>Give them Slam. Here's how to make it work. Shaman get slam but it doesn't increase in skill. It is an innate ability.<P>If a warrior uses slam/bash skill he can't kick. So as a trade off for getting slam make it so if slam is used then the other attack are unavailable until things recycle.<P>&lt;Risk Reward Balance&gt; <BR>So they get a chance to disrupt a caster but lose the chance to use one of their special attacks for a round.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>just an idea for retuning thunderkick (currently it is worthless).<P>idea #1 up the dmg a lot and establish a higher minimum dmg. those "thunderous kicks" for 24 suck, im always so glad that i waited 5 minutes for it.<P>idea#2 during usage of this discipline make flying kick recycle on a much faster timer.<P>idea #3 add a stun to it and increase its chance of hitting<P>oh yeah, we need a signifcant dmg upgrade.<BR>at 55+ monks dont pull at all, with reduced aggro radius we always have a higher lvl character cast or arrow to pull singles with extreme ease. FD has become largely useless in your typical group excursion. any warrior worth his salt has nearly twice the hp as us and more ac, and since our edge in dmg is so small, i dont feel like there is any compelling reason to group a monk over a warrior unless he happens to be your friend.<P>i think a good enhancement would be changing<BR>monk epic to 10/16 or 11/16. this would easy solve the problem with dmg balance. decrease in delay is pretty much useless since enchanter haste bottoms out our delay anyways. this would also be good because the monk epic is much more readily obtained than monk uber weapons like Tstaff or stave of shielding. i also like this idea because it reduces our reliance on weapons to compete dmg-wise with other melee classes, and this was originally "the vision".<P>thanks for taking the time to read this</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi there I have a comment about Monks Human vs. Iksar. I feel that it makes no sense that the Iksar monk has had a fighting skill REPLACED by tail rake. While it may seem unfair, the Iksar race has a GENETIC advantage here of an extra appendage.I believe the Tail Rake should be a very low level skill, perhaps offering stun abilty, and that the Iksar monk should also recive all of the skills that a Human monk does. What because they have an extra limb, they can't do a kick? Makes no sense. Crazy thing is I don't have a monk. I have a High Elven Wizard on a PvP server. Iksar monks are my biggest Concern. But still this is a inconsistency i see with the class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
