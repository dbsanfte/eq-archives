</FONT><HR>Jerkguy, do you think CH is the only healing spell clerics keep memmed? Do you truly belive its the one spell we cast most of the time? Seriously?<P>you are basing your 6 to 8 times better healers solely upon CH.  While its a nice spell when the situation is right, its not the be all and save all of healing.  I personally take pride in how well i can keep enchanters alive, regardless of where we are and what we are doing.  From juggs to frogs to bzzats, i know how to keep my enchanters alive.  Do you think i do this with CH?<P>Oh and one point you forgot to mention, how do tanks get up to 4 to 5k hps?  A cleric alone could not get a warrior to 4k hps. so plz tell me what class is *NEEDED* to achieve this.  Thanks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Jerkguy, again you're making up stats.<P>"clerics can heal 6 to 8 times better than the next best healing class"<P>Where oh where is your proof? What are your stats? Show me da money.<P>Where do you get the "3x disparity?"<P>Please prove this. Ok, I have a bard, he can't melee as well as a warrior. But he does melee. This is a disparity of 19 to 24.8. Verant Fix this. Where is my proof? I don't need proof. I'll make my own numbers up.<P>Btw, where is there a percentage heal in the game? It's been mentioned several times that CH is in fact just a High number, not 100%. So a 60% heal will have to wait for the next game.<P>Go back and look at the posts.

</FONT><HR>*sigh* nice to see people ignoring good suggestions...<P>Some misconceptions here...<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;Shamen/druids need a % heal<P>As much as it would be nice and helpful I don't think it's possible to do. CH isn't a 100% heal, it's a 10,000 HP heal. That's why it goes up in efficiency. To do a % heal you'd have to calculate (target HP * %) to get a figure. If it's done client side it can be hacked. If it's done server side you add more computations that the server must do.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;If you specialized in Alteration you wouldn't fizzle so much<P>Clerics generally don't use Divine Light, our 53 heal spell. The reason? It fizzles like mad. Chain fizzling a 250 mana spell isn't good, let alone the 350 DL costs. Unlike shamen and druids, however, we fall back to Remedy and CH (and more recently Celestial Healing). Keep in mind that these fizzles are despite Alteration at 253 and Specialize Alteration at 200.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt; If you knew how to play right you wouldn't complain<P>To a certain extent shamen CAN play primary healers in normal exp groups. I've seen it done. But in some of the newer areas and some of the higher ones you run into highly resistant mobs. Slow might be resisted. Turgurs might not stick. A 600 HP heal, especially a fizzle ridden one, just won't cut it. Heck, even DL wouldn't cut it. There is a need for a 1k+ healing spell to at least try to keep up.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>As a shaman, I will put in my 2 cp.<P>Irony?   I went to heal a cleric and he died because my S.Heal fizzled three times in a row and he was dead before the fourth attempt.  <P>The fizzle rate of the spell should be dropped dramatically, which, from this thread, it appears most clerics agree to this. <P>I am going to post, again, my comparison on healing between a cleric and a shaman by levels before I make my next statement.<P>Lvl 1 - 13 doesn't matter<BR>Lvl 14 - 18 clerics are slight better<BR>Lvl 19 - 38 shamans are better<BR>Lvl 39 - 52 even ( shaman using togor, chloroplast, and greater heal versus clerics using CH / also consider mana regeneration)<BR>Lvl 53 - 59 Cleric (No question!)<BR>Lvl 60 Still not determine - (Shaman with torpor, turgur and S. heal) so Even.<P>By my own comparison I see the clerics only advantage above shamans, except for the 53 - 59 levels, has been their resurrection line of spells, otherwise I can see that playing a cleric from 1 - 49 must have sucked and I applaud those with the patience that did so.  I am of the mindset that these clerics should have the "monopoly" for the 6 levels. However, this does restrict play since for a cleric to be competent/efficient they need their pets, the enchanters.  So now you have monopolized 2 out of the 6 spots in a group.  This I do not agree with but what is the alternative.<P>There are 2 options that I see:<P>1) Leave things as they are, but reduce the S. heal fizzle rate and leave the cleric their 'monopoly'. <BR>2) For Shamans/Druids to receive  S. heal at lvl 49 and a new 1200hp heal in the mid 50's than  provide clerics with a useful offensive weapon from lvl 1 - 60.   This can be done, as I said on an earlier post, by revamping stun.   Stun could be revamped to come in waves (example,a 42 second wave ( 6 sec stun, 30 seconds, 2nd 6 sec stun)  and  a 2 min wave (8 second stun, 30 seconds, 8 second stun, 30 seconds, 8 second stun, 30 seconds, 6 second stun)),  increase the length of stun as they increased the damage (6 sec, 12 sec, 18 sec), finally provide a 6 second stun with a low cast time and minimum mana.  Next, increase the clerics melee ability slightly.  With the combination of stun, slight increase melee ability, and their already high AC,  this will allow, finally, clerics the ability to solo and give them another option, outside of healing, if another healer is in the group<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> I think the level chart comparing Clerics and Shamen is very misleading. Have a look at one poster wrote:<P>"Lvl 1 - 13 doesn't matter"<P> Probably not.<P>"Lvl 14 - 18 clerics are slight better"<P> Healing is a big upgrade (during those levels) from Light Healing. Clerics are much better.<BR> <BR>"Lvl 19 - 38 shamans are better"<P> From 19-24 it may be even, but from 24-29 clerics are much better. Regen + Healing + Canibalize is quite inferior to GH.<P> From 29-34, I think Shamen have the lead.<P> But at 34 Clerics get SH, which shamen don't get for another 19 levels! Many people are arguing that this is an adequate post-50 heal! Regen + GH is not nearly as good as SH.  <P> At 39-50, I still think clerics hold the advantage. SH (250 mana) and CH (400 mana) both beat out the combination of Chloro (200 mana) + togor (175 mana -- _assuming it sticks on the first try_) + GH (150 mana). Especially if pulls are steady. Togors takes a long time to cast, and mobs are going to be beating on people during that time -- and the health can only be restored by GH, not something more efficient. The shaman in this situation is going to run out of mana MUCH faster than the cleric, even with Can II.<P> I think the situation is essentially the same even after the shaman gets Turgurs and Can III. <P>"Lvl 53 - 59 Cleric (No question!)"<P> Agreed.<P>"Lvl 60 Still not determine - (Shaman with torpor, turgur and S. heal) so Even"<P> I seriously doubt Torpor is enough to put them on even-keel. And if it does, it shouldn't.<P><BR> Now don't get me wrong: I think clerics should ALWAYS be superior healers to shaman, and superior enough to make them attractive enough that groups will invite them despite their intense specialization. I just disagreed with the poster's estimation of their respective abilities at the various levels.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Gotes,<P>Yes my comparison is very subjective to my experiences. <P><BR>Your response:<BR>"Lvl 14 - 18 clerics are slight better" <BR>Healing is a big upgrade (during those levels) from Light Healing. Clerics are much better.<P>Clerics are better but not by much.  Walking sleep and light healing do pretty well at these 4 levels, plus inner fire 10mana for 20 points of healing, a 1:2 ratio, provides great downtime healing.  The best part of inner fire is, with its 3 second cast time, it can teach shamans how to cannidance. Med, wait till mana ticks, stand and cast inner fire, sit and 2 seconds mana ticks again. Rinse and repeat.  A pain but it helps. <P><BR>Your response:<BR>"Lvl 19 - 38 shamans are better" <BR>From 19-24 it may be even, but from 24-29 clerics are much better. Regen + Healing + Canibalize is quite inferior to GH.<BR> <BR>Add our slow line to the mix.   <P>Your response:<BR>From 29-34, I think Shaman have the lead. <BR>But at 34 Clerics get SH, which shaman don't get for another 19 levels! Many people are arguing that this is an adequate post-50 heal! Regen + GH is not nearly as good as SH. <P>Correct SH is great but so is tagar at 29 and togor at 39.  I have a second shaman character at lvl 32 now.  Plenty of times when I have grouped with a cleric, the clerics states he is not needed since regen and quickness on tank and tagar on mob makes his job obsolete.   I just tell them to have fun, get out from under the book and fight but save a bubble or two of mana for emergencies. <P><BR>Your response:<BR>At 39-50, I still think clerics hold the advantage. SH (250 mana) and CH (400 mana) both beat out the combination of Chloro (200 mana) + togor (175 mana -- _assuming it sticks on the first try_) + GH (150 mana). Especially if pulls are steady.

And if it does, it shouldn't. <P>At level 60 S. heal fizzle rate is all but gone, at least for me.  Turgur is only being resisted 4 times in an 8 hour period.  Torpor…. This remains to be seen especially since it will not overwrite regrowth in the next patch.  One can only hope.   That is why I stated not to be determined and place it at even. <P>Your response:<BR>Now don't get me wrong: I think clerics should ALWAYS be superior healers to shaman, and superior enough to make them attractive enough that groups will invite them despite their intense specialization. I just disagreed with the poster's estimation of their respective abilities at the various levels<P>Yes Clerics are the superior healers on a single casts. However, shamans, with our versatile spells, are a match and sometimes better at various levels.  We can always debate on who wins out on what levels. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Verant cant win here you all know that.<P>My Cleric is now level 59 and I have a level 39 shaman. So I think I an talk about this.<P>First off Mocking clown said that Clerics can solo well into their fifties ? what the hell are you talking about. Yeah I can solo a high green if Im lucky forget about a blue mob. I soloed my cleric to level 14. Soloed in the 20's but died enough to realize that root and nuke wasn't cutting it. I soloed level 49 at the wall in Dreadlands I spent some 500PP on sow potions to do that. I tried soloing an exp giving mob in my 50's but couldnt do it because I did not have enough mana. My wisdom at level 47 was already 207 so that wasn't the problem. Plus my nukes have a long delay and well roots arent reliable.<P>So yes I agree something needs to be done about healing at post 50's but saying that clerics can solo well into their 50's and gain exp is a bold face lie.<P>Now lets look at this healing monoply and please put on your thinking caps because people haven't been using them on this thread.<P>First off verant cant just throw around class abilities that would destablize the game. Oh i know you want a cleric healing power and have a mule cleric standing by to res your fat ass when you die ? Next it will be clerics have a high exp ressing monopoly. After that it will be clerics have a HP AC post 50 buff monoply blah blah blah cry me a river you whiners. <P>Lets look at the two classes.<P>Clerics- Masters of healing in any damm game you play. Their power is divine based and god in origin. We call upon the gods to apply our trade and do it well. Clerics one ability is to heal thats all we can really do. Everything we do is based on keeping the party members alive. We can do NOTHING ELSE (remember this sentence). I am talking about the post 50 game. Any cleric past level 29 and in a full group has no business nuking at most all they should be doing is stunning.<P>Shamans/Druids- Not masters of healing. Healing is secondary to them and therefore they are NOT MASTERS of healing. They have many abilities with healing being one of them. They can do way more than just heal and therefore they are diverse and not centered around one ability like clerics are. Their power is not divine based or god in origin THEREFORE they should not be as good. Never mind the fact that they can port , sow , debuff dot etc etc.<P>Summary:Clerics Specialize in keeping people alive with their heals and buffs. Their power is divine based. This is all Clerics can do.<P>Druids/Shamans-Dot, Sow, Debuff , nuke, slow , port and heal. Healing is secondary to them and not their main trait. A single druid or shaman can never step in and take over from a cleric as it should be. Their power is not divine based.<P>So having read this and yes this is how verant properly designed it do you still think they should match that of a cleric ? or even come close ? If so will you druids give up your snare, sow , dot and port to the clerics ? I doubt it.<P>Things I agree on.<P>Remove the abnormally high fizzle rate on SH. It should still fizzle but not 3 or 4 times in a row like I have seen in the past. At level 59 I cant remember the last time I fizzled a heal spell or any spell for that matter. So yes even without specialization in Alteration Shamans and druids are paying to high a price on the fizzle thing. 1 fizzle at most but not 3 to 5 in a row on SH. After all they are in they are their 50's they are not rookie casters like they were between 1 and 39.<P>Another specific Druid shaman only heal spell that does between 800 to 1000 HP heal. However with this increased healing spell should come a higher than normal mana cost lets say 500 mana for a 1000 point heal. After all you are not masters of healing and any extra healing above SH should come at a cost of extra mana. Give Druids and shamans anymore than that makes the cleric class redundant except for having a mule ressing cleric camped in the zone to res you when you die. Just having ressing is not enough to keep people playing a cleric. <P>So please understand the difference between clerics and shamans/druids before saying clerics are cry babies. Try to put a little thought into what you ar saying.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Appolohades (and others):<P>Appolo earlier accused me of making up stats that Clerics can heal 6 to 8 times better than the next healing class. He apparently did so because even he would find such a HUGE disparity between classes on such a crucial element of gameplay to be unreasonable. I showed where I came up with those numbers (pls check PG 5 and my post there) and inspite of that he posts again on pg 6 making the same accusations. Appolo can you read? Apparently not. <P>I will go over this again:<P>sup heal = 583 pt heal.<BR>Ch = all possible (at this time) hp's healed<P>At high lvls it is VERY common for tanks (primrily the ppl who take dmg and need healed) to have 4 to 5khp's with buffs. In optimum circumstances anyone by doing simple math can see where my earlier claims came from. Even in nonoptimal circumstances clerics will heal 3to6 times better than next best healing class. <P>So pls show another area of gameplay that has this great a disparity between the class that can do something the best and the next best class at doing the same thing. You wont find anywhere near this dispartiy between classes in things like:<BR>tp's, mana regen, mezz, slow, haste, hp buffs, ac buffs, etc etc. <P>Clerics have NO special right to such favored treatment on such an element of the game so crucial to gameplay. <P>Should clerics have the best healing: YES<BR>Should it be substantially better than the next best healing class: YES<BR>Should it be 6 to 8 times better: NO WAY<BR>Can another healing spell be given to support classes that wont ruin the cleric class: YES</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>And if as clerics have claimed that the cast time on Ch is too long for it to be used as a primary heal spell then they should have no problem with another class getting a very nice heal with the same cast time as ch. <P>After all it wont be functional to use according to the clerics. But this brings their hypocrisy to light. Because when we speak of their ch spell we hear, "oh but the cast time makes it to unsafe to use very often", but when another class asks for an upgrade healing spell even on the same cast time as ch we get, "oh no that would be severely imbalancing." <P>You can't have it both ways. If it is a long cast time then if another class will accept it why would you care? According to your reasoning it cant affect your class in the least because of this cast time. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Have to add something to every post about this matter. Help make sure nothing is actually done.<P>First of all, back on page one.. we can solo? PFFFT I haven't laughed that hard yet today and second period was very amusing.<P>Yes we can solo.. the undead.. at the bottom of blue range.. with full mana.. taking 3 minutes to kill and 10 to regen mana. Yes that's soloing.<P>Anyway, to all you cleric enviests look at it this way.<P>Do you want a druid or shaman to be able to step in for the cleric and "keep up" with the group? To clarify: a 1 to 1 replacement where the group might not be as good as before, but it can keep up on mobs.<P>Yes: Clerics are now useless. Why in the name of Tunare would a group want a cleric when they can just grab one of the too many druids or shaman and get sooo many other spell lines? BTW about rez? Good groups DON'T die. Good groups that get train.. evac.<P>I'm going to ASSUME you mean to answer no the the question 2 paragraphs above. Let's go a little further then.<P>Do you want (for example) 2 shaman to substitute for 1 cleric with an advantage? Clarify: take out cleric, add 2 of shaman or druid and the result is a benefit for the group.<P>Yes: There have been soo many times where I've done 5 person groups. Usually 2 tanks, an int caster, me, and the an enc or a rog or some nice filler class. If we don't have an enc, usually a paladin or druid to crowd control (well.. root  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> That being said, that group would drop me in a second for 2 shaman if they could keep up and then some. Shamen get sooo many other spells they would rock the group like nobody's business.<P>Again, I'm going to assume you mean to answer no. Last question.<P>Do you want to be able to have a 2:1 substitution where the druids/shamen can keep up with the group but slow it down slightly.<P>Yes: News Flash.. YOU CAN. Some of you shamans must not be playing your class properly. Mob comes in. Wait like 5-10 seconds for a hate list to start. Slow the mob down. Repeat if it doesnt hold. You very well might get aggroed but with good melee's, you won't. The tank should already be speeded. Everyone should have regen. Have 1 of the 2 dru/shm be designated as full time healer chain-casting SH. Have the other (preferably SHM) be the slower in case above. Once the mob situation is under control, first priority is healing casters. If their health is ok, you also start the chain-SH'ing of tanks.<P>It's not always pretty. It takes alot of skill and coordination. But it works. Instead of just noting, "Herm. Group A is in D1. Group A has 1 cleric and no backup healers of any kind. Group A has yet to have anyone die. I'm in group B. I'm a druid and buddy here is a shaman. We are dying. *thinks* Thus this is not fair."<P>Consider yourself the problem. Re-evaluate tactics and strategy and try again.<P>Also as a note.. lets say theres a Camp X. Camp X gives the best exp in the GAME as per the level. It is not unreasonable to DEMAND the BEST POSSIBLE group (= cleric) to go there.<P>Just because you are 55+ does not mean you _deserve_ a deep seb or Velious dungeon group. Hey there's a spot open in dog capn in karnors for a backup healer..<P>Know your role. For the most part, BACKUP HEALER. Coming from a cleric, I LOVE it when grouped with a shaman, and am mildly elated with grouping with a druid. They can take over if I get oom, or if im fom i don't feel bad about going in and having fun for 30 seconds taking some swings at mobs.<P>Sometimes when no cleric is around you have to double up shaman or druids and hope you don't die. If you scared little kiddies would just try it with 2 SKILLED SHAMEN or DRUIDS it WILL WORK. The only way it won't work is if the warrior goes..<P>/g '***?!?! n0 kl3rik?! l0gG|ng by3'<P>Cuz poor him is unwilling to take the chance. If you are too scared to try some semi deep dungeon without a cleric cuz *cries* you scared of death.. this is one cleric w/o sympathy. If you all suck and you do die, guild will help you out.<P>Said this sooo many times. Oh well, hopefully VI reads and confirms no enchanements needed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Now look at who is clouding the issue. We are talking about MONOPOLY in healing. Do you get this at all? Apparently not as you keep making reference to slow spells. If you would look at the disparity in slow spells between classes you would find that the difference is microscopic compared to healing differences. <P>And let me tell ya I know many monks, rogues, and even freaking druids, who can hit 4khp's or slightly more. We do high lvl raids all the time (veeshans peak last week) and even casters have over 3khp when buffed. So yes my numbers are very accurate. <P>Also everyone can admit and acknowledge that TANKS are hopefully the ppl that will primarily need healed if ppl are playing their classes correctly. And as such the 6 to 8 time numbers stand. <P>And no I do not think shaman/druids are worthless once they hit 50. <P>And if you had read my post on page 5 I even said that I DO NOT CARE WHICH CLASS GETS A NEW HEALING SPELL. I DONT CARE IF VERANT CHOOSES TO GIVE THIS SPELL TO WIZARDS. But I do know that a new healing spell is needed and warranted in light of these facts to do with healing. It would only improve gameplay overall.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;"I'm still laughing at the fact that one of the original posts said that Clerics can solo well into the 50's HA HA HA"<P><BR>See the funny thing is, that many people know that there are places that clerics can solo blue mobs well into the fifties. It's not something we said theoretically, it's something we've done or witnessed being done. When you as a cleric laugh at it as if it were impossible, you show your own lack of knowledge. <P>Now noone said that clerics were as efficient  soloers overall, but then again noone is asking to become as efficient a healer as a cleric.<P>The problem there is that cleric can solo much better than shamans and druids can heal at high levels. But why would a cleric want to solo at ALL, even if the cleric is an well known jerk, he will still have littlle problem finding a group.<P>While obviously it makes little sense to solo when you're THE class that gets tells to group from the moment you log in, it's very very possible, caster mobs in particular make good targets for clerics, who tend to have an easier time with them than clerics or shaman do, their stuns give them an excellent method for controlling the flow of the battle, root and atone provides a form of crowd control. No, clerics can't root and dot them or quad kite them, but neither can druids and shaman when we're talking about caster-mobs.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Jerkguy, I'm not clouding the issue, you're closing your eyes to factors.<P>What is healing? Damage prevention/negation.<P>Since you're not a cleric, I'll fill you in on something "neat." When on a dragon raid for example, I will Cel heal the first tank in my group who takes damage. The Hp returned over time help to prevent a loss of their life for the next few ticks and it gives me a chance to heal other people at the same time.<P>That is prevention.<P>Negation is healing with a straight heal spell. CH, Remedy, Sup Heal, etc.<P>Shaman Prevention is SLOW. Say it with me SLOW. I think a 60% slow is pretty impressive. 60% less damage that people take, 60% less that I have to heal on someone, giving me more time to keep my team alive.<P>So with that in mind, NO you didn't include much of the shaman repetoire in your formula so it's flawed to begin with and you 6-8 times desparity doesn't exist. Slows and Debuffs are indeed a part of what make you a priest class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047656-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047656.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047656-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047656-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047656-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047656-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=047656&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=047656&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
