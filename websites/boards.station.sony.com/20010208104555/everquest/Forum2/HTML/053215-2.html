</FONT><HR>This thread will most likley be fairly long, but Ive tried to make it readable and somewht intersting so please read it even if it gets boring  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> at the very least you will learn something about the class.<P>Due to Absor no longer responding to this thread this will most likley be my last post on it unless some blue named person atleast responds again so we know there still listening.<P>First off the problem with hybrids in general is multipenalites, I went through this last night and looked at our skill levels and it appeared that you guys averaged our skill levels compared to those of our pure classes to determine our melee and casting ability, however thats wrong.  At level 50 when hybrids were/are balanced skill differences were alot smaller overall, heres the differences between our melee skills and a warriors at lvl 50, damage output will not be considered in this because that is based soley upon weapon selection/aviabality for how much damage you will do<BR>Offense: Lvl 50-97.6% Lvl 60-92% Gap widened by-5.6%<BR>Defense: Lvl 50-97.6% Lvl 60-92% Gap widened by-5.6%<BR>1hs: Lvl 50-100% Lvl 60-92% Gap widened by-8%<BR>2hs: Lvl 50-100% Lvl 60-92% Gap widened by-8%<BR>1hb: Lvl 50-100% Lvl 60-92% Gap widened by-8%<BR>2hb: Lvl 50-100% Lvl 60-92% Gap widened by-8%<BR>Piercing: Lvl 50-100% Lvl 60-91.3% Gap widened by-8.7%<BR>Dodge: Lvl 50-87.5% Lvl 60-82% Gap widened by-5.5%<BR>Parry: Lvl 50-87.5% Lvl 60-82% Gap widened by-5.5%<BR>Riposte: Lvl 50-87.5% Lvl 60-82% Gap widened by-5.5%<BR>Double Attack: Lvl 50-100% Lvl 60-92% Gap widened by-8%<BR>Dual Weild: Lvl 50-0% Lvl 60-0% Gap widened by-0%<BR>Archery: Lvl 50-37.5% Lvl 60-37.5% Gap widened by-0%<BR>Kick: Lvl 50-0% Lvl 60-0% Gap widened by-0%<BR>Bash: Lvl 50-87.5%% Lvl 60-82% Gap widened by-5.5%<BR>Disarm: Lvl 50-37.5% Lvl 60-37.5% Gap widened by-0%<BR>Hand to Hand: Lvl 50-100% Lvl 60-100% Gap widened by-0%<P>Those widening caps make us worse than warriors by a large margin because multiple penalites stack, we start off being 88.24% of a warrior in melee (lacking dual weild and kick) now take our penalites into consideration using only the melee skills which we will have in the fight, not including taunt disarm or disciplines, dmg output from weapons is not considered as well, or ac on armor:<BR>92% as good at offense, were now 81.18% as good.<BR>92% defense, 74.69% as good.<BR>92% of one weapon skill, 68.71% as good.<BR>82% in dodge, 56.34% as good<BR>82% in parry, 46.2%<BR>82% in riposte 37.89%<BR>92% of double attack 34.85%<BR>82% of bash 28.58%<P>That leaves us with 28.58% (being generous as I omitted a few skills there, as well as defensive which makes a huge difference) of a warriors combat ability, this is far from the 75% of them which we supposedly are.<P>Now I will do the same type of breakdown for spells not taking into consideration the resistability, usefulness or power of the spells in question.<BR>Channeling: Lvl 50-100% Lvl 60-90.9% Total gap change-9.1%<BR>Alteration: Lvl 50-100% Lvl 60-100% Total gap change-0%<BR>Abjuration: Lvl 50-100% Lvl 60-100% Total gap change-0%<BR>Conjuration: Lvl 50-100% Lvl 60-100% Total gap change-0%<BR>Divination: Lvl 50-100% Lvl 60-100% Total gap change-0%<BR>Evocation: Lvl 50-100% Lvl 60-100% Total gap change-0%<BR>Spell Selection: Lvl 50-32.8% Lvl 60-38.8% Total gap change-+6%<BR>Meditation: Lvl 50-87.5% Lvl 60-86.2% Total gap change-1.3%<BR>Specialization: Lvl 50-0% Lvl 60-0% Total gap change-0%<BR>Specialization: Lvl 50-0% Lvl 60-0% Total gap change-0%<BR>Specialization: Lvl 50-0% Lvl 60-0% Total gap change-0%<BR>Specialization: Lvl 50-0% Lvl 60-0% Total gap change-0%<BR>Specialization: Lvl 50-0% Lvl 60-0% Total gap change-0%<P>Again, with the exception of our spell selection compared to Necromancers the gaps widened again, not as severley as the melee side of us did but still widened a good deal.  Taking into consideration the skills we lack completly we start out with 61.54% of a necro's casting ability, now take into consideration our penalites on the other skills, not taking into consideration mana cost and mana regeneration penalites.<BR>90.9% of the channeling makes 67.7% of a necros ability.<BR>38.8% of the spell selection makes 26.27% of their ability.<BR>86.2% of the meditation ability leaves us at 22.64% of their casting ability.<P>28.58% of a warrior  (before defensive is considered) and 22.64% of a necromancer leaves you with 51.22% of a class when being generous to their skills and completly ignoring some penalites.  Verant how can you justify making certain classes this weak?  We used to have weapons which were extremly powerful because of no dual weild now (while I wasnt planning on mentioning the weapons by name as I dont want to see them nerfed I will to prove my point) Ill take two weapons: Ebon Mace, and Willsapper<BR>Ebon Mace is a 19/24 weapon, in the hands of a Level 60 SK with 40% haste it does approximatley  32.72 dmg a second after factoring in Double Attack (Eduin posted this same sort of thing earlier  on Part One of this discussion, however because he didnt factor in double attack his numbers will be somewhat lower than mine).<BR>Willsapper is a 13/20 weapon which is more common (7 of these on my server since the release of velious, compared to 5 maces since the release of kunark) than an Ebon Mace and can be dual weilded, in the hands of a Level 60 Warrior with 35% haste it will do approximatley 51.8 damage a second (29.78 dmg a second in an sk's hands with 40% haste if you wish to compare)<P>Now if this isnt bad enough the Ebon Mace is the BEST SK 1h weapon currently in the game with the exception of some stuff possibly found in sleepers tomb.  The next closest weapon to an ebon mace in game currently is the Dragon Tooth Shard which comes to 3.1% LESS damage than an ebon mace.<P>As you can hopefully see Absor or whoever else may be reading this, hybrids (although this has focuses specifically on sk's rest assured were not the only ones with this problem) are in severe trouble, by the time were fighting high level velious encounters were just about as fragile as a caster but we dont even deal the same damage as a warrior using only one weapon.  There have been numerous solutions proposed in this discussion so far among them were:<BR>Higher HT<BR>Defensive discipline or something close<BR>Higher skill caps<BR>More hp<BR>More ac<BR>More atk<P>There were certainly more as well but if you read this thread and listen to the ideas from the higher level sk's (no offense to lower lvl sk's out there but please dont take what they say about the high level game of eq which is generally described as 55+ at face value because they more than likley dont know what there talking about) and do something about it.  Absor, you said you knew very little about sk's?  Well why not speak to the top sk's on various servers?  Im sure most of them (myself included) would be willing to help and suggest ways to improve the class.<P>Brael<BR>Level 60 Grave Lord<BR>Enlightened Dark<BR>Tarew-Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I forgot to mention that Blood Ember isnt as heavy as people are claiming it to be, if your going by the screenshots on Eq'lizer remember those were submitted prior to the weight being reduced on it (happened 3 weeks to 1 month after kunark was released), Darkforge isnt all that heavy either if your smart, I myself am a Dark Elf... my base strength is 80, since level 14 or so I have NEVER had a problem with carrying things, true i had to wear banded until level 27 or so but back then banded was just about the only choice (unless you were a smith then you could afford brzone) anyways for those of you who are complaining about your strength get some weight reduction containers and all your problems are solved, my strength isnt particularly high either but it dosent matter, my weight is 58 when fully equipped in my heaviest armor (blood ember, noct, whatever you pick) the weight problems on it are not nearly as severe as people are making them out to be, espically after darkforge and blood ember had their weight changed (they have both been made lighter through patches).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Something I'll suggest to any SK my level(27th) or below that's clonking around in bronze or blackened iron armors.<BR> <BR>Fine plate is better AC(your god) and lighter weight. 1000pp would easily get you at least three major pieces(BP,legs,helm or boots).<BR> <BR>I'm rich compared to most SK's my level(master tailor,w00t) and I STILL use fine plate in many locations cause it's GOOD.<BR> <BR>Annnnnyhow...it is true that multiple skills being at a lower level has a cumulative effect on the defense and offense of the class as a whole.<BR> <BR>I want my defense caps upped to warrior levels. At high levels,I could care less how often I hit-I'm not going to be the prefered primary damage dealer EVER,being a hybrid. Give me high taunt spells instead.  Make those spells give me superior defense. And let them stack properly with high-end buffs from others(if a drain/vortex/whatever) or over-time/debuffs(if to a monster),and be WORTH using. If I'm going to be a defensive hybrid, my spells + my defense skills should make me a superior defender at the cost of having crud for attacking capacity. Joe Warrior,Fu the Monk and Stabzyou the Rogue can outdamage me all they want. I just want to be able to keep the mob on me the entire time and be able to survive it,given timely healing(in the case of ubers) or taking reasonable levels of damage(in normal encounters).<BR> <BR>A lot of problems won't be fixable until ubermobs get the nerf beating of the century,IMHO.<P> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>  Well,  I will refrained from going over and repeated some of the same thing others have posted here.  I am here to support the posts by Xilith and Brael.  Most of us SK gets together and have a long and detailed dicussion about making us and any other hybrids class more "Balanced".  Mainly we all agreed that this is not a "wish list" or a "whineno" thread but a Clear, Detailed list of things that would make us and other hybrids more "Balanced".  Mainly Issues is in Ubber mob encounters. Those threads that represented for us by Xilith and Brael are gear towards that end.  When we were 50 lvl its was balanced after kunark and velious come out there is just a HUGE gap between the classes vs hybrids when it come to defensive skills.  why lvl to 60 knowing, with each lvl, the gap gets even wider ?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>BAH! I know I said I was done posting but an idea just came to me for making harmtouch useable on uber mobs WITHOUT overpowering it on normal mobs... change it from a straight dd to being based on the mobs lvl, your lvl, and the mobs hp, say:<BR>((Your Level+Mobs Level)*10)+Modifier<P>the modifier could be based on the mobs total hp as well as your level say for example (Mobs HP*A) where "A" could range from .0001 at lvl 1, to .0005 at lvl 60 (static increase of .0001 every 12 levels or a gradual increase of .0000083 per level)<P>Also this change would allow for the UnholyAura discipline to be removed giving us room for another much needed discipline, however for this to work HT would need to hit 100% of the time (no resist check, much like tashini)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>  Good post Brael, it really nicely illustrates what I had posted really far back in this thread (I just touched it though). <P>  As some minor points to add to the discussion, I was grouping in Howling Stones last night with a few members of my guild. The tank would be either myself or a level 51 ranger. Over the course of the night I noticed that even though rangers are supposed to be more offensive than us, and less defensive the ranger was tanking better than me by far and doing much more damage. (we both had compareible equipment).<P>  ps: absor we are still missing the sk recap.<P>lyme. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First: Take away the HT disc it was always suppose to be an innate ability make it one again. Keep the damage it does now but having to use a disc is just well lame it was like VI did not know what to give us SK’s. So they gave a ability we already had a boost and really did not give us anything new. <P>Second: make the 60 discipline Leechcurse actually class defining. Just like the warrior disc’s but in a SK fashion (using Xilith’s/ideas from Knight’s watch as a catilist) Give us Leechcurse at 55. Make its refuse time 30 min, make the damage v/s heals 6 times the amount of damage we do. (my idea) also make it so it increases in time for each level post 55 ; 10 sec each level <P>55 10 sec <BR>56 20 sec <BR>57 30 sec <BR>58 40 sec <BR>59 50 sec <BR>60 60 sec <P>So a 60 SK would have a 60-sec disc that heals only. Giving us the ability to taunt/tank one umber monster. Now for the down side because the SK is so drained after such a time as tank the SK’s mana bar goes to 0. His price is the loss of his spells to become the tank. (this means SK’s will loose the ability to FD if the situation goes bad) <P>From your own hand it is defensive.

</FONT><HR>First: Take away the HT disc it was always suppose to be an innate ability make it one again. Keep the damage it does now but having to use a disc is just well lame it was like VI did not know what to give us SK’s. So they gave a ability we already had a boost and really did not give us anything new. <P>Second: make the 60 discipline Leechcurse actually class defining. Just like the warrior disc’s but in a SK fashion (using Xilith’s/ideas from Knight’s watch as a catilist) Give us Leechcurse at 55. Make its refuse time 30 min, make the damage v/s heals 6 times the amount of damage we do. (my idea) also make it so it increases in time for each level post 55 ; 10 sec each level <P>55 10 sec <BR>56 20 sec <BR>57 30 sec <BR>58 40 sec <BR>59 50 sec <BR>60 60 sec <P>So a 60 SK would have a 60-sec disc that heals only. Giving us the ability to taunt/tank one umber monster. Now for the down side because the SK is so drained after such a time as tank the SK’s mana bar goes to 0. His price is the loss of his spells to become the tank. (this means SK’s will loose the ability to FD if the situation goes bad) <P>From your own hand it is defensive. It is simple, with a balance for the tanking, loosing spells. Coming from a SK who has been to Velous and the 30-min battle this Disc is not overpowering. It would just be enough for a cleric or 2 to save a few people or the Porters to get everyone off the field of battle.

</FONT><HR>I doubt any of the people playing SKs considered their role defensive. We want to be the original baddie, like Darth Vader or Lord Soth. If a mob could think, they'd be goin', oh crap here comes an SK...not laughing in derision at our feeble skills.<P>SKs are cold blooded killers who fight dirty and are masters of the un-even battle. Lesser creatures would know better than to mess with an SK. Offensive and defensive skills don't have to be as good, because mobs would never get a chance to hit them. They'd be HTed, Dotted, feared, and attacked from behind. Only when the mob is cowering and near death would the SK step in, smiling, to issue the killing stroke. They agents of our dark dieties, and should be feared and avoided.<P>---<P>Give SK the Screaming Terror spell<P>I'm surprised SK don't already have this. This would allow SK to help with crowd control in high end encounters and pull mobs off the poor enchanters and clerics.<P>---<BR>Give SK a Backstab or ability to critical hit from behind as a higher level dicipline.<P>This would allow SK to do a little more damage with ubermobs without eclipsing the other classes.<P>---<BR>More of the It "Sucks to be You" type spells<P>SK should be able, thru spells, to achieve some sort of competitive advantage. The ability to suck all the buffs it needs (Str, Int, Dex, Etc) off their opponents would do this.  This would be similar to how the siphon strength works. <P>---<BR>Skeletal Warrior Spell<P>Ability once per game day to turn into a skeletal warrior for limited duration. In this mode, could do considerable amount of damage (like 49 necro pet), but reduces AC and HP during the duration.<P> <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The biggest beef Ihave with the Sk class is our spell selection. I am not sure if its right to sayour spells are too weak, or too strong but I WILL say that the majority of our spells are highly impractical to Shadowknights. When Shadowknights were first created its apparent that not much thought was given into spell selections and how it effects us, or doesn't. The problem is that necromancer spells are good for NECROMANCERS, not necs. Shadowknights.    <BR>An example:<BR>Spirit Drain, level 60 300 or so life tap. Its casting time is close to 6 seconds. Every Verant staff member has said that Shadowknights ARE tanks, if so why are we given spells that we cant use while tanking?  If we cast Spirit Drain it takes us about 6 seconds to cast in, in that time we are foregoing doing 300-400 melee dmg, and are taking 600-700 dmg. And those numbers are kind. As you can see there is a LARGE oppertunity cost that is given up casting Spirit Drain. Please note also that this **assumes** we get the spell off on the first try, 90% of the time I would get interrupted in a fight.  So I can't use this spell in combat.  Verant look at our spell list, this applies to MOST spells in our selection. I have heard Verant Reps say its good cause it reduces downtime...for what? we are supposed to group, if we are in Sebilis and I life drain a green mob like suggest I would take 2k dmg at least before its dead.  Soloing for a SK is possible but completely ineffective, it takes me 7-8 mintues just to kill a blue mob my level. Then I have downtime. This is my biggest beef we have alot fo spells but many aren't practical for a TANK which is what we primarly are so when you choose spells pleae keep in mind that there is at least 1 very strong monster attacking us when we need to use the spell.  <BR>Also I have heard that our good quality is our Variety cause we are both Necro and Melee but guess what? The necro(our parent class) has more utility then us.  Necro's can do a little of almost everything yet we can do minimal lifedrain spells which dont even heal 1 round of combat dmg.  If we are supposed to be Versatile MAKE us versatile plz!  If we could give mana to casters, have screaming terror, and maybe death pact(necro version of heal which takes your health and gives it to someone else) give us that versatility you claim we should have and I would be happy, with that verastility I would make myself useful because it would be in my power because I would bring a level of versatility to the group, right now all my spells are selfish and only benefit me but if thats the case that I am supposed to be indenpendent then you need to make our spells stronger cause right now with all our spells and all our might with the exception of feign death we aren't anymore independant against most mobs our level all our spells can't even prolong our death by 5 seconds.  <BR>We swing an Axe like we should, we take hits like we should, please make us use magic as we should.<P>-Ghouldan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Also with Bash enabled weapons Orges and Trolls should bash for double normal bash dmg, if small races can bash we should bash better its simple logic that a troll could follow.  As it is now most trolls are kinda peeved at iskars which when they have thier epic can bash, regen, have better ac then us, the are basically us + more AC for the same exp penalty which is bogus its not fair for a 'new' race to come out that is significantly better than old ones, and your not given the option to switch races. Trolls and Orges wouldn't be doing a ton more dmg we would just be doing a little more, and we should we are bigger. Also are saves balanced? what justifies a troll's low saves? we are 15, 25, 15, 5 20 which is 10-15 base points lower then most, I know we are suspect to fire cause we are troll but there is a word that is often used on these boards..hmm...balance? is that the word, yes I believe it is, if we are weak against fire cause we are troll you think we would be highly resistant to Poison and Disease since we have such a great regenative body.

</FONT><HR>Also with Bash enabled weapons Orges and Trolls should bash for double normal bash dmg, if small races can bash we should bash better its simple logic that a troll could follow.  As it is now most trolls are kinda peeved at iskars which when they have thier epic can bash, regen, have better ac then us, the are basically us + more AC for the same exp penalty which is bogus its not fair for a 'new' race to come out that is significantly better than old ones, and your not given the option to switch races. Trolls and Orges wouldn't be doing a ton more dmg we would just be doing a little more, and we should we are bigger. Also are saves balanced? what justifies a troll's low saves? we are 15, 25, 15, 5 20 which is 10-15 base points lower then most, I know we are suspect to fire cause we are troll but there is a word that is often used on these boards..hmm...balance? is that the word, yes I believe it is, if we are weak against fire cause we are troll you think we would be highly resistant to Poison and Disease since we have such a great regenative body. But our disease and poison resists are worse than a humans<P>/boggle<P>Also check my above post please Absor if you have time if you can reply to my issues just so I see what you think I would appreciate it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My comments stem from what I see as the double personality I think Gordon has had on shadowknights to date.  Most recently he is now saying they are a defensive class.  That may be his idea but it is not how the SK is geared.<P>Offense, defense, and weapons skills have always been maxed upon reach level 39 and do not increase until you cross 50.  While giving armor upgrades is supposed to help there simply is not enough defense when equipped to be a defensive character.  Higher damage dealing weapons are nice but there remains a problem if you cannot manage to hit the mob but once every 6 swings.<P>Second, the spell line of SK's is offensive/debuff.  They have nothing to do with defense.  So I think Gordon's vision of SK's and the programmer's implementation of SK's are two different things.<P>It also seems that the spells are supposed to make the difference.  Problem has been that most of the spells are simply too watered down to make up for it and there is too much magic resistance in the world.<P>It seems to me that the hybrids, for whatever they were originally considered, have each become a different flavor.<P>Ranger = low hitpoint, low AC, good damage machine.  They have all the attack skills and their spells are geared toward dealing damage.  They are therefore the OFFENSIVE hybrid.<P>Paladin = med/high hitpoint, med/high AC, med/low damage machine.  They lack the melee punch many other classes have but their spell line is geared towards keeping people in the battle.  They are therefore the DEFENSIVE hybrid.<P>Shadowknight = med/high hitpoint, med/high AC, med/low melee machine.  The spell line here though is confused.  Here is where I think the focus should be.  My suggestion is to clarify the shadowknight as the DEBUFFING or DISTRACTING hybrid.  I think all of the SK issues can be handled by the spells.<P>To begin, the shadowknight can siphon strength early in life but never improve upon his ability to steal more life.  Why?  I think the shadowknight should have a much higher strength stealing spell that comes into play.  This would help increase the attack rating as he does using shroud of hate.  This is one way to add attack without playing with offensive skills.<P>Vampiric embrace is level/2 +1.  The proc is truly not that often such that I cannot understand why the SK cannot have that restored to level +1.  Do you know what it is like to be a shadowknight and watch a paladin steal more life at a faster rate than you when an enchanter has put Boon of Garou on them?  (Boon really cheeses me as followers of goodie two shoes gods can tap life better than the followers of lifetapping gods.)  If there are going to be lifetap experts, let the necros and SK please be the ones, not the enchanters.<P>Lifetap spells simply are meaningless as combat enhancers.  They can be deemed both offensive and defensive spells as the have a dual role when cast.  At level 30 you cheer as you can use lifedraw to tap more than 11 points of damage.  Wow, up to 45 steal now.  Not enough.  All the way to level 49 you can tap for 45.  This spell is usually not memorized.  It sucks up too much mana to restore too few hitpoints even after the battle.  I the vision is now that the SK is more of a lifetapper as his means of being defensive, the I think the entire siphon life line should be reconsidered in the post Kunark world.  In line with this, I think that if a SK goes through the quest to get their quest spell to tap for 280 hitpoints using over 300 mana, the recycle time should be cut down.  The mana requirements alone will keep SK's from abusing it.  I also think by doing this the weakling races a reason to cheer creating the thinking SK and going for extra INT and mana vs the typical troll/ogre Gordon has always referred SK's to be in his history of posts.  The lifetap series should therefore follow a more rigorous progression.<P>Banshee Aura should be removed from the level it is attained and either removed or given much early in career.  I would suggest level 39 considering the weak damage it does.  It adds to aggro on the mob and that is what we are seeking.  If it must be a level 56(?) spell then I think maybe it should get a booster shot up to at least 20 damage.<P>Pets.  Pets early are a help as the mobs can be hit by the pet during these levels.  Even at level 30 your pet will hit a giant once in a while for the first level or 2.  At level 39 you can buy the pet spell but to cast it has become a waste of 2 bone chips since your pet is all of level 20.  To have a pet start out 19 levels below you and have it mean anything 29 levels below you in the world that has been created since Kunark is really inadequate.  I think at 39 a pet of level 24 or even better 28, would be of value fighting mobs till level 49.  An pet increase at 49 would follow this logic as well.<P>I have run out of time for more and I think maybe out of space to keep interest.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OK well SKs have some issues as all other classes do.  And I think most people agree that the problems mostly came about with the release of kunark.  What happened is that Sks trailed behind warriors in abilities and when the level cap was raised the margin became too great.<P>Yes Sks did get some nice spells to compinsate.  But warriors got disciplines which are far more powerful than any of the SKs spells.  Though they can only use them for short periods of time while SKs have a mana pool that can be quickly regained.  <P>The problem with this is that what the shadowknights got above 50 were far less HPs and skills than warriors and level 50 necro spells.  Though it's very nice to have powerful spells and tanking ability we run across the same problems as necros against difficult encounters but 10 times as bad.  (I know you've seen the necro's posting their problems on raids)<P>In my opinion SKs should either have nearly the same defence as warriors or nearly the same HPs as warriors.  Having both of them so much lower widens the tanking ability gap too much.  Just having one lower would keep warriors as the superior tank and still most desired for tanking while allowing SKs a nice spot to fill.  <P>Well that would fix the gap left in the levels 50-60 due to kunark but not adress the discaplines.  Even if warriors had no discaplines SKs would fall short on raids.  In normal groups SKs are nearly as good as warriors even with their discaplines though.  But what I've noticed is that discaplines don't come in very handy in normal groups.  Sure they are nice but they don't change too much.  I think SK should get at least one discapline that's useful on large raids.  Many people have suggested many good ideas.  I think even giving auto parry at level 55 (unholy aura shouldn't be a discapline...  HT should just get the boost naturally at 55) would make sks a more useful tank on the encounters.  <P>People have discussed the SKs spells are great in groups but useless on large encounters.  Their damage is far less than a warrior and they can't outtank a warrior.  For this I would suggest adding a discapline that would be very useful to these raids.<P>There are many ideas for these on the board.  Many bad and some pretty good.  I hope that something happens in the future</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just emphasising that I would like to see shadowknights get the opportunity to "Specialise" in ONE weaponskill of their choice so that ONE particular weapon cap could be lifted to match or even slightly exceed a warriors.<P>In our own history the great Knightly Orders of the medieval era had their own disciplines and schools in which they taught their followers the latest developments in warfare and fighting skills. It has constantly amazed me that in the EQ world the knight classes lag so far behind the warriors in this regard, when if you did a RL comparison the knight should always be the more acomplished and 'disciplined' fighter.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Having been a high level warrior and now an SK I think I might have a little room to compare...<P>Paladins/SKs are the only shield carrying classes in the game for the most part so it goes to reason that we along with the warrior (the master of all things combat) would be equal in the area of BASH. Warriors may know how to use it but we’re the ones that actually do. Also give us some nice 'useful' shields...have you looked at the shields in this game? Better but... considering that a shield can be the great equalizer between our two armor classes, we give up dual wielding damage in favor of AC thus allowing us to tank more and stop whining about being pounded into the ground…<P>The big 'D'. From levels 1-50 Warriors are meat-shields period. Their damage output is pretty thin so we can’t take that sole role away from them. They taunt and they get beat on but steadily after 50 they are killing machines. So give us opposite roles. This makes them the superior meat-shield but gives us a job because in theory our spells should lend us more damage. You would have to make our spells stick a little better at sub 50 levels. And then at +50 when they become killing machines and we become even more useless start giving us a HP bonus so that we can take a beating. Or personal buffs that are stackable with other classes so we can rival a warrior's HPs at 50+. The point is we need a job at 50+ and I’d be happy with punching bag... Since our spells become useless against higher mobs make us and those dirty Paladins for that matter the meat-shields. It gives us a job<P>We get HtH capped at 75, why don’t we get a kick? 75 is better then nothing. Least that gives us 3 potential attacks even if the kick only lands once every 10 tries... <P>Make our HT stick against Ubers. 800 out of 20,000 Hps isn’t much but maybe you'll actually hear someone say "grab 3 SKs that'll give us a 2400 point killing blow" as opposed to "Oh that's your buddy? I was wondering who invited the SK." When’s the last time a Pali tried to LoH the party warrior only to have it resisted? With a re-pop of 90 minutes I don’t see how this unbalances the game especially since it you spend more time saving it for just the right life saving moment then actually using it. <P>Bottom-line, utilize shields more. They are the great AC equalizers. Make our over priced mana costing spells stick more. Least them you might hear “Well SKs are average tankers but at least he can Cling the mob and keep himself alive with taps.” Let us kick, a 75 capped kick is not going to turn the tide of battle but anything helps and for so little of a gain you might satisfy the masses. Come on….HT. This is why you play a SK. Every 90 minutes someone should think, “awesome our SK’s HT is back lets rock this guy.” Think about when you fight that Troll in Rathe and you know he’s got an HT waiting for you, who doesn’t say man I hope he hits the Pet with it. It’s supposed to be scary and from the player side its just not. The default is more along the lines of it wont stick but if it does then great.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>While all these discussions of specific powers, spells, and skills is fine and good we are all (both players and VI) missing what is core to all these discussions.<P>**If the game is to be group oriented then there needs to be a role for everyone in a group.**<P>This in mind it is not really ok to just say "this class is supposed to be defensive"  since, in the terms of this game, that could mean a lot of different things.  In an effort to clear these thing sup... let's first look at what things a group actually needs:<P>You can group needs in two ways:<P>Damage Dealers (melee, ranged, magic)<BR>Damage Absorbers<BR>Utilities (healing/buffing/crowd control)<P>-or-<P>Attack (Melee, ranged, magic)<BR>Defense (Taunt, Damage Absorption, Crowd Control)<BR>Utility (Healing, Buffing)<P>Now - let's look at which class can do what:<P>Warrior - Best at Melee attack, Best at Taunt, Best at Damage Absorption, Decent with Ranged Attacks.  As they can fill two whole areas of a groups needs alone and are the best at them they are highly sought after in groups.<P>Cleric - Best at Healing, Decent Buffing, Decent Crowd Control, Decent Damage Absorption, Low Melee Attack, Low Magic Attack.  As staying alive is one of the main points of grouping the Clerics unsurpassed healing skills make him as highly sought after (sometimes more sought after than the warrior).  That little red bar is the only thing standing between us and experience loss after-all.<P>Enchanter - Best at Crowd Control, Decent Buffing, Low Magic Attack.  Highly sought after for the Clarity Spell (which gives clerics the little blue bar that lets them make the little red bar grow)<P>Shaman/Druid - Best at Buffing, Decent Magic Attack, Decent Crowd Control, Low Damage Absorption, Low Melee Attack, Low Healing.  Many groups enjoy having these guys around for the buffs and to have the backup damage, a backup healer and backup crowd control.<P>Wizard - Best at Magic Attack, Decent Crowd Control.  In the cases where a group doesn't have their extra spots filled with multiple warriors (or other "tank") groups like these guys just for the sheer damage output.<P>The following classes are fairly much left out in the cold unless there is an open "tank" slot that needs filling: <P>Monk - Decent Melee Damage, Low Damage Absorbtion<P>Rogue - Decent Ranged Attacks, Decent Melee Damage, Low Damage Absorbtion, Low Taunt (through backstab).  Rogues come in handy in those very rare places with locked doors or traps.<P>Ranger - Best at Ranged Attacks (unfortunalty, anti-perching code prevents this from being any use), High Melee Damage, Decent Taunt, Low Damage Absorbtion, Decent Crowd Control, Low Healing, Low Buffs, Low Magic Attack<P>Paladin - Decent Ranged Attacks, Decent Melee Damage, Decent Taunt, Decent Healing, Decent Damage Absorption, Low Buffs<P>Shadow Knight - Decent Ranged Attacks, Decent Melee Damage, Decent Taunt, Decent Damage Absorption, Low Magic Attack, Low Crowd Control<P>And finally the following classes are also left out in the cold unless another caster is needed:<P>Bard - Decent Buffs, Decent Magic Attack, Decent Damage Absorption, Decent Crowd Control, Decent Healing, Low Melee Attack<P>Necro - Decent Magic Attack, Low Crowd Control, Low Melee Attack (through pet)<P>Magician - Low Magic Attack, Low Buffs, Low Melee Attack (through pet)<P><BR>Now as you can see things are slightly skewed here as to group usefulness.  You have 6 slots in a group.  You have 5 classes that are the best at what they do (Warrior's doing multiple things).. leaving one slot open for an additional character who is most likely to be another one of the "best at what they do" classes.  If, and only if, one of those classes is not available will one of the lesser classes be chosen... and typically another "tank" over another caster.<P>I'm not sure if this is something you can really fix as much of what's wrong goes to the core of the game itself.  Adding more group slots would be a start as would increasing the abilites of the "lesser" classes so they were as good as the better classes in at least One of their "Best" areas.  Then again, if you made the solo game more viable we all could play the game without worrying about all this group balance.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Err mr Run, you are way off base on most of the class descriptions you posted. <P>Shadowknights need these things in order of importance in order that they be a viable option in groups for all areas of the game.<P>1) Screaming Terror: This spell works as a lower rate mez and would make SK's very useful in raids of the planes and other multi mob areas as a backup when a ench goes out of mana. This would take a class which verant knows is not very group friendly and make them wanted in many groups. The roleplaying value of this spell is also right in character for our class. Freezing a creature in place with pure terror is a very SK sounding thing to do.<P>2) We need the spells of the SK to have the mana penelty removed. We get these spells at a much lower level then the necromancers get them and that is enough penelty to keep our power in check. The lower level necro spells that we use are not mana efficient before the penelty. This is because they are low level spells and are meant to be mana costly to the low necromancers. The problem lies in the fact that while the necromancers are starting to get quite mana efficient taps at level 39 plus we are using their mana hungry level 12 spell. The fact we are using this spell is fine but the fact it takes 3 times the mana that it did at level 12 for them is way too harsh. At level 35 I can cast this level 12 necro spell a grand total of 5 times with a full bar of mana, that is with 88 int.<P>The fact we are tanks and require great AC on our armor will always preclude us from having the mana pool of a necromancer. We are lucky to have 120 int on our characters and little of our armor has mana bonuses. This coupled with the fact we use low level spells that are not mana efficient is really all that should be required to keep us in check.<P>It is apparent to Verant and the players that we are weak compared to many classes. A quote from one of my guild mates was "A SK is always needed when fighting in fear" curious I asked him why he thought so "Someone has to loot the Umbral". That is what people think about SK's so I really dont think the mana penalty being removed is really gonna push us over the edge for power. Really we cannot even see the ledge from where we are right now.<P>3) Bash: The bash cap should be as high as a warrior. We use the skill more then they do and where they dont really care about it (especially after 55) we need it through our whole lives. This is one skill that is at least as much SK as it is Warrior.<P>4) The pets are fine as I see them, yes they are weak but we are the tanks when we fight, not them. Plus the level 58 pet we get is quite good and should need no improvment.<P>5) Augment death should be attainable as a SK. I would be happy to have it as a regular spell but if you think that is too easy then perhaps we can have a difficult quest for a item which has the spell on it, maybe a plane of air quest. Another great place to put the spell would be on one of our pieces of armor. The noctivant BP comes to mind or perhaps another one of those long quests in Velious. Just dont put it on a armor that the Iksar cannot wear as that would be wrong.<P>6) When a person compares the Palidins and the Shadowknights we can see that one is oriented towards defence and the other towards offence. Look through the spell list and you will see this. We are leant to dish great dmg where our counterpart Palidins are meant to be able to survive attacks. In the end we should be close to even in combat as these strengths counteract each other. We need our Offence lifted close to the level of the warrior if not right to there level. The fact we do not duel weild (nor should we) and the fact we do not triple attack will always keep the warriors dmg higher then our in pure melee.<P>7) AC: There is no way that rouges and monks should have greater AC then us. We wear big heavy armor that is meant to absorb blows and allow us to tank. Monks and rogues are meant to dish great dmg and use evade and invoke doubt so they dont get hit. As it stands right now the monks and rogues at level 60 have more AC then a SK. This is due to there Defence capping at 252 where ours is over 20 points lower. I agree that warriors should have more ac then us. With comparable equipment they do because of the great AC on warrior eqipment. I dont even mind if the warriors go above 252, they are the main tanks. What I ask is that we be below the warriors AC but above the offensive nontank melee. This can be done by raising our defence cap by a amount which you would have to decide. We are plate wearing knights and should be able to tank a mob better then a backstabbing little chain wearing rogue.<P>These are the main issues I have with the class. If you look at eacj individualy and impartially as I have I think you will see the logic or see the apparent increases to the classes well being. I like the idea of the class and that is why I play it. It is apperant to most out there that the class is flawed and I believe you would make the right choice in learning about and then repairing the class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Its a mixed blessing that shadows are so few in number. On one hand we are few and our voices are realitively weak. VI can ignore us.... and few would care. On my server there are fewer than 15 shadows 55+... On the other hand being rare is a benifit. Shadows suffer from fewer,"we suck posts". Most shadows have had a hard time learning the class because, frankly, VI made us terribly weak for most of our existance. Before Kunark Shadows were what shadows should have been... Dark Knights, things to be feared. Post 50... life has been kind but not as kind as it has been to our heavily plated brothers the men/women of the swords. I hope VI listens and sees that shadows do need a slight upgrade in defensive power and also a slight upgrade in offensive power. The later can be obtained through many means...  I hope someone out there listens...<P>GLAUX <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As an example of the mana difference of the SK vs the necro compare the level 39 lifetap spells:<P>SK: 45dmg for 63 mana (if it were unnerfed)<BR>Necro: 226dmg for 189 mana<P>SK efficiency we get/give 0.71 hitpoints per cast if it was unnerfed<P>necro efficiency they get/give 1.21 hitpoints per cast<P>This should be the difference that makes us weaker. Not a imposed mana penelty against our cast. As you can see without the mana penelty we are not at a casting level of the necro, we are where we should be instead. With the mana penelty imposed we are next to worthless when casting spells and this is why.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ALL SHADOWKNIGHTS AND ABSOR LISTEN UP!  <BR>  <P>  Ok, I would like all your attention and feed back on this idea as its pretty radical but could fix most of our problems except the uber raid encounter.<BR>  <BR>  Ok, 50+ lieftaps and dots are usless becasue of their long cast time.  Get rid of em.  Unlike what people are syaing i think the pet is the answer to fixing our dmg output.  Pets are the perfect dot for a sk.  They are casted before hand and dont take up our time to melee.  Get rid of all dots except snare line which should end with dooming.  Keep lieftaps up to our 50 quest spell one. None after this.  Get rid of all undead charms.  Maybe keep undead nukes, i think this is good as they are still useful.  <BR>  <BR>  In place of loosing these many spells is give us much stronger pets.  Escpeically pre 50 and up the level by one or two post 50. Problem with dots is our sucks and is overwritten by and necro in group.  Lets the necros be masters of dot.  But if we have truly strong pets, we can add much more to a group than now.  Pets i feel are the true answer to all this except for uber raids.<BR>  <BR>  The 50+ uber raids will be fixed by replacing one of our discplines with a good defensive one.  <P>  This is how i suggest doing the pets...<P>lvl 9 = same pet<BR>lvl 15 = lvl 12 necro<BR>lvl 22 = lvl 20 necro<BR>lvl 30 = lvl 24 necro pet ( this may seem unbalanced but remember we dont get new spells till 39)<BR>lvl 39 = lvl 29 or 34? necro pet<BR>lvl 49 = lvl 39 necro pet<BR>lvl 52 = lvl 44 necro pet<BR>lvl 58 = lvl 49 necro pet <P>  It would take some balancing to figure whats best. Problem with sks and pets is we dont get spells neraly is often as necros. So as they seem close to necros, remember the necro will get 2 pet upgrades in the time we get one.  This is to help balance the higher lvls before new spells. <BR>  <BR>  Spells I suggest getting rid of or lines rather...<P>--&gt;  All DOT's except snare which should end at dooming darkness.<P>--&gt;  All lieftap's 51+, just toess em.  Let our quest spell be our best one as its the only one we use anyways.<P>--&gt;  undead charms and maybe undead nukes?<P>  These are the spells that are supposed to balance us, but we never use em beacause of insane cast times. If our pets were upped to be our only DOT, it would be the fix we need as we dont have time to cast durring battle.  <P>  I would love to hear feedback from anyone in the SK communtiy and absor as well.<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This was gotten off of Caster's Realm, which got it off of Monk Talk AND this is direct quote:<P>&lt;&lt;Well, this is something that I seem to have encountered with the shadow knight talk earlier. Some want offense, some want defense. Keep in mind that it is highly unlikely that getting both would be balanced. When compared to a warrior, a monk will either be more offensive and less defensive, or the other way around. Being better at both isn't balanced&gt;&gt;<P>What does this mean then? We either suck at dmg dealing etc. or can't live 10-20 seconds at uber-encounters. What is up with that?<P>VI's blue names like to not read posts, so they say I'm not reading the rest of person x's post/reply because of reason x. BUT maybe, just maybe the rest had valid points.<P>Would upping both D&O seriously affect Warriors? <P>VI never seems to ever know what they are doing. Their usual answers are I don't know why that was implemented like that, different variances of that, etc. FOR ONCE IN THE ENTIRE EQ LIFE SPAN ANSWER TRUTHFULLY !!! How many people still work (game design/balancing wise) on EQ? WHO should I give credit to for being the game designer (my hopeful job of the future)? I can clearly see they are not the most imaginative, due the lack of variance in spells, because most spells look something like this class x's spell/spells general ability of t = class y's spell/spells general ability of s Which in lamest terms could be like this x=t, y=x, t=s, therefore y=x in some sort of way. Is this how it should be? Thats how SKs look in comparison to Necros, their entire life. I never knew SKs=Necros, it is really mind-boggling. Who ever said SKs=Warriors? This is the formalu that VI TRY to gives us <BR>SK= 3/4(Warrior)+ 1/4(Necro) or maybe they mean something like SK= 3/4(Level of same level Warrior)+ 1/4(same level Necro). Using formula 2 we plug in experimental numbers lets say level 60 SK. 60SK= 3/4(60Warrior)+ 1/4(60Necro), then<BR>60SK= 3(15)+ 1(15), then<BR>60SK=45+15. 45=The level we fight at of a Warrior and 15=The level we fight at(cast) of a Necro. Do these #s seem a bit off, most definitely yes for Necro, but that far for Warrior, I truly don't. So does that mean VI wanted us to be like 15 Necros? That would seem absurd, but that definitely seems the case due to someone making up %s of what we are 8D 8P<P>SO doesn't that mean that VI has to get rid of WHOLE 75,25 thing? Why most definitely YES !!! Can anyone do anything else like VI formula, but get Necro more accurate, while it equalling 1 (3/4+1/4 or some different #s). I can, but not 1 8D 8P Just make us equal 5/4 (2/4 Necro instead, which then equals level 30 Necro) which equals 1.25 8)<P>This hybrid % thing is a joke cause VI needs some basic Math ie some Algebra I, maybe Algebra II etc.<P>Well also like to say VI said in Monk thread that they want to reply to Warriors soon also (like they need much work). By the way they cry for some Invis type thing, speed enhancer type thing, more hp (they say gap in hp is too close 8P , well thats a joke in itself), more AC (they also say too close 8P ), and forgot others, but that pretty much it.<P>"Fear can it not make you die?<BR>Fear does it not make some cry?<BR>Fear causes some to lie,<BR>Fear causes others to try.<BR>Fear is it not the only thing to fear? <BR>Guess what...
