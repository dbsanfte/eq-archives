&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I play several classes including a Cleric and a level 53 Shaman.  I have some ideas to both balance and ease implementation.<P>ITEM: Standing Meditation.<BR>DESCRIPTION: My idea for Wraith form at the bottom of my post covers this area and several others, please examine it.  <P>ITEM: Defense skills.<BR>DESCRIPTION: I think anyone wielding a shield or shield-like item should get shield Bash regardless of class.  Give it to all of us and it's balanced.<P>ITEM: Stuns.<BR>DESCRIPTION: I think all of us would like to see stuns work on high level MOBs.  Maybe make them specific for other casters so that Enchanters are overall better at stuns (i.e. improve Enchanter stuns to work on any MOB, improve Cleric stuns to work on any Undead MOB, give Magicians stuns against all Summoned Elementals, give Druids stuns vs. all animals, give Shaman stuns vs. all spirits, etc.).<P>ITEM: Death Pact / Divine Intervention.<BR>DESCRIPTION: Take away components for all spells of all classes that do not create a permanent item.<BR>                   <BR>ITEM: Healing Over Time.<BR>DESCRIPTION: Fix the bugs.<BR>     <BR>ITEM: Aegolism.<BR>DESCRIPTION: Like I said above, remove components for all temporary spell effects from all classes.<P>ITEM: Symbol of Naltron.<BR>DESCRIPTION: Again, remove components from all temporary spells.<P>ITEM: Shield of Words.<BR>DESCRIPTION: More AC is always good.<P>ITEM: Divine Light.<BR>DESCRIPTION: Once any caster maxes spell casting ability at level 50, I think there should be no chance for fizzle (obviously they can still be interrupted though).<BR>                       <BR>ITEM: Heroism/Heroic Bond.<BR>DESCRIPTION: I think a spell caster of any level should be able to overwrite beneficial spells cast on him/herself with his/her own spells.  Either that or give a message window like with a Ressurection that allows a caster to choose whehter or not he/she wants to allow a beneficial effect to override his/her current beneficial spell effect.<P>ITEM: Abolish Disease.<BR>DESCRIPTION: I don't think anybody really cares about this as anything but a negotiating point.  If Clerics want the same Cure line as Shaman, give it to them.  I don't see why all healers shouldn't have the same Cure line at least.  They should have had it to begin with.<P>ITEM: Invisibility (personal only).<BR>DESCRIPTION: Please read my idea at the bottom of this post for Wraith Form.  I think it's an awesome idea for Clerics.<P>ITEM: Self-only Gate to Temple.<BR>DESCRIPTION: There are supposed to be special benefits to worshipping each specific Deity.  Give all casters that actually worship a Deity a spell that will self-only Gate them to their race's Temple of that Deity.  <P>Questing is always a good approach, as long as you don't make it a static spawn that must be killed or forced to spawn which causes people to camp it for days on end (contact me if you want my ideas on possible solutions to this problem).  NO FUN IN CAMPING REAL TIME DAYS FOR QUEST NPCs!  You should be able to move from one step to the next without having to schedule an appointment with the rest of the server.<BR>                     <BR>ITEM: Holy Armor / Spirit Armor / Guard / Armor of Faith / Shield of Words / Bulwark of Faith line of armor spells<BR>DESCRIPTION: As above, allow ANY caster to overwrite beneficial spells on him/herself with his/her own spells or give a choice window. <BR>                  <BR>ITEM: Banishment of Shadows.<BR>DESCRIPTION: As above, remove component costs for spells that do not create a permanent item.<P>ITEM: Group Resist Poison.<BR>DESCRIPTION: Again, this is a non-issue for the rest of us and this obviously benefits everyone, not just the Cleric.  Give it to all healer classes if necessary.<P>ITEM: Root or Mez undead.<BR>DESCRIPTION: Clerics in every genre I've played in the last 20 years (don't laugh, yes I'm old, hehe) have had tremendous power over Undead.  They could turn, destroy and even animate dead.  Necromancers were the undisputed masters of the dead, but Clerics had direct influence from their Deity making them powerful indeed.<P>Solution - Clerics already have a root line of spells.  Instead give them a Mezz line vs. undead only and an Aggro-wipe line also vs. undead only.  Give Paladins the same spells at later levels.<P>ITEM: Gate to Temple (self only).<BR>DESCRIPTION: Adding the Wizard spell that sends anyone in a group to their bind point was a great start for our meleers, but all non-hybrid casters could gate already.  I think all casters would find a Gate to their Temple very useful.<BR>             <BR>**ITEM: 51+ buffs<BR>**DESCRIPTION: This is something I want for all of us.  Make the duration on ALL buffs of EVERY 51+ caster the same as Shaman Shrink (i.e. Permanent until dispelled or the character zones, camps, goes LD, or dies).  <P>As these buffs are already limited to high level characters, it will not create a whole host of new 1st level characters powerleveling to 50.  This will also negate some of the post 50 caster boredom and free up more mana so casters don't have to perma-med and can get into the action more.<P>**ITEM: Form of the Wraith (self-only)<BR>**DESCRIPTION: This is an idea I always thought would be cool for a Cleric.  All of the casters but Clerics now have some kind of transformation spell.  My idea is when a Cleric casts FoW, he/she turns into a ghostly outline of their starting racial appearance (i.e. no armor or item shows so it's not graphic intensive).  <P>It should be retroactive so it's similar to the other classes with stronger variations at higher levels (I'd like to see Shaman Bear form like all other transformation casters too - all of them have some new variation or increased power as they attain higher levels - shameless Shaman plug).<P>The Wraith form would have improved AC and mana regeneration.  It would also have the Invisibility component like Air Elementals where after a certain amount of time the Wraith would auto cast a type of invis on itself.  The Wraith wouldn't actually become invisible, but would have the same benefits and limitations as normal Invisibility.<P>This would take care of so many problems including but not limited to: Cleric boredom at higher levels with all that sitting to med, a need for an Invisibility spell, a cool new form to look forward too as levels progress while at the same time balancing Class issues.  All of this would make the Cleric much more fun to play.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My apologies, it's late here (or very early depending on your point of view).  I did forget about Wizards on the transformation spells and I must have had a brain hiccup when I thought Magicians got Elemental transformations.

</FONT><HR>Just curious, why are clerics so anti-druids/shamans getting better healing spells, but you complain about having to sit and med all the time.  Wouldn't have secondary healers that could actually heal decently (not as well as you) free up more of your mana/time and alleviate some of your boredom?? (Note that druids/shamans taking a slightly larger role in healing than currently would involve them sitting on their hindquarters all the more)<P>Seems like this would be a better solution to your downtime then getting a new mana regeneration ability/spell that EVERY other casting class will complain about not having.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The 2 problems I have, is I want a bit of fun and be to able to travel through a zone without being in a gang or begging for SOW.<P>On the fun side, there seems to be some good stuff being said, but not on travelling.<P>A prevoius post had an awesome idea on angel form, which we will never get, to good, and to much fun.<P>I have posted an idea for a spell on this board which I think is a viable option, I will state it again.<P>A new spell pilgrimage.<P>A long cast time of 6 to 7 secound(so it could not be used to escape mobs).<P>You get 15 mins of invulnerability.<P>You must walk , if you run the spell is broken.<P>With a recast time of 20 mins.<P>The spell might need fine tuning like no stun or stopping mobs following you(creating a train to zone). Only in normal zones not dungeons.<P>Why this, well invisability is great earlier on but as you start going into higher zones to many nasty creatures can see through invisability.<BR>Hence one of the safer ways is to use SOW but being clerics we will never get a speed of movement enhancement.<P>So this spell would be in line with people who think we should not have invisabilty and should not have SOW.<P>Hell, it is the slowest way to travel making sure we really are bored, but we might now stay alive moving through the green trash.<P>  <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>To make up for my blunder above, I have come up with ideas for both the Magician and Wizards so that they too can have tranformation spells.  <P>First I think the Magician should have the elemental forms like Enchanters.  Tack on appropriate buffs that would help balance their form with other class forms.<P>Wizards are a tough lot to think of a proper transformation spell.  There was only one thing I could think of that wouldn't require a lot of dynamic effects around a character: Ice.  <P>The Dwarven shield from Velious looks really cool, would it be possible to give the wizard a golem form in ice?  Again, tack on buffs appropriate and lacking from the Wizard's current stock.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am a wizard but am interested in what other casters think about this post to wizard board.<P>TO THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM VIA ABSOR<P>ITEM: mana regeneration <P>THIS is a REQUIRED for all casters NOW to begin the balance of the caster versus melee imbalance that exists. This is needed for all levels as the trickle down of better gear pre-kunark to melee class has skewed the basic caster melee equation into the low thirties. The trickle down of gear from velious is just beginning and its effects will further skew this imbalance to even lower levels and make the midlevels worse than they are now.<P>A token fix here will produce no good results. You guys study this in combination with efficiency and resists to ALL casters. This is not an option but a necessity in the entire life of the caster.<P>ITEM: Spell efficiency<P>SEE ABOVE AND IS REQUIRED FOR ALL CASTER CLASSES FROM ONE TO SIXTY FOR THE SAME REASONS. Forget about the damage of mages, druids, and necros compared to wizards. FIX the caster imbalance first then work on the individual class differences in your vision of them. DO NOT<BR>fix class imbalance before you fix the basic caster=melee imbalance. <P>The scientific method (and its clear you are not using this) requires that the basic sides of an equation must be equal first, then changes to one side of that equation must be met by an opposite but equal change on the other side of the equation.<P>YOU have a basic desing flaw now because of a lack of understanding of the basic equation for the game. YOU FIXED ONE SIDE OF THE EQUATION SINCE BEFORE KUNARK WAS BEING DESIGNED AND NEVER TOUCHED THE CASTER SIDE. KUNARK AND POST 50 PLAY INCREASED THAT GAP. STILL FURTHER ENHANCEMENT OF THE MELEE SIDE OF THE EQUATION AND INEFFECTIVE CASTER FIXES(NON RECOGNITION OF THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM OF THE ORIGINAL FLAW STILL WORKING ITS WAY DOWN) PUSHED THE ENVELOPE FURTHER AS VELIOUS WAS RELEASED. <P>SURELY YOU REALIZE NOW THAT ALTHOUGH THE CASTER FIXES WERE NICE, THEY WERE WAY BEHIND THE MELEE CURVE FOR BALANCE.<P>VEILIOUS AND ITS INEVITABLE TRICKLE DOWN WILL ONLY MAKE IT WORSE.<P>BALANCE THE BASIC EQUATION IF YOU CAN,THEN WORRY ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL CLASSES. THESE ARE TWO SEPARATE ISSUES AND YOU MUST BALANCE THE BASIC EQUATION BEFORE ATTEMPTING THE CLASS BALANCE.<P>ITEM: Percentage damage spells<P>Same as above.<P>ITEM: Level cap on spells<P>Put same level cap on melee where they simple cannot damage a mob at all or remove it from the caster side of the equqation.<P>ITEM: Alkabor<P>This has nothing to do with balance, forget about it. They suck and you cant fix em. The game is not geared to ae play on any scale with overcrowded servers. It makes no sense to crowd an already crowded game.<P>ITEM: Flaming Sword<P>Leave it alone and we can let it go to last page of never used spells where it is now. NOT an issue for balancing the basic Melee Caster equation. Mages and Necros have their pet=better sword and thats just fine with me and prolly most wizards.<P>I mean, what the hell is the point of the thing??/<P>ITEM:Harvest<P>A WIZARD specific item that needs improvement but needs to be considered in with the basic caster melee equation and issuse in the first two items.<P>ITEM: RAIN spells<P>AGAIN refer to first two items. FIXING a specific damage spell needs to be considered within the basic melee caster equation first.<P>ITEM: Atol's <P>WHAT is the fizzle thing post 50 in a caster class that is way behind already. Fizzles got worse post kunark. ELIMINATE fizzles post 50. What is the point. Give a resonable explaination of this??????? What is the logic here for balance and fun.<P>LOOK AT FIZZLES ALONG WITH RESISTS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FIRST TWO ITEMS OF THIS POST AND FOR GOODNESS SAKE, GET REAL.<P>ITEM:Snare/enstill<P>Most wizards never use em work on item one and two above first priority. To heck with em, none of this line is usefull to a wizard now. Fix them later, fix balance first.<P>ITEM: invis vs undead<P>A comment like " I dont know why wizards get this in the first place" is not reguarded as an answer unless followed by because ........<P>I don't know why a paladin, enchanter, etc etc get it either.<P>ITEM:TELEPORT<P>Not the basic problem fix in later<P>ITEM: fade, shadowstep, and yonder<P>DOH<P>ITEM:Evacs, Abscond etc<P>Secondary problem should have been fixed at implementation if they were tested at all by the test team. FIZZLES are incomprehensible as stated above.<P>ITEM: Melee Proof mobs<P>DOH DOH DOH Somebody get him off me??? Somebody get him off me ???? Whats the point here ?????<P>ITEM Diamond Rod<P>Most wizards could give a hoot. Balance the basics first, you have a ton of pre 50 play crap like this, fix it when you can. If you do anything let it cast mannaskin the preferred post 50 skin.<P>ITEM: Imbue fire opal<P>If you dont have the right god who cares??<P>ITEM: Eye of zomm<P>DOH. I have never used it for anything productive and this would probably be the case for most wizzies. BALANCE FIRST<P>ITEM: Damage spell variety, critical hits<P>TIE IN WITH THE BASIC IMBALANCE OF CASTER MELEE IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS POST.<P>ITEM: Lure spell for wizards<P>HERE IS THE DEFINING SPELL FOR WIZARDS FOR UBER MOBS MAKE IT BIGGER AND CUT THE RESISTS. WHY SHOULD A LEVEL 60 MOB RESIST IT IN AN ALREADY DEFICIENT CLASS. IT ISNT EVEN ALMOST IRRESISTABLE AS THAT IMPLIES SOME LARGE NUMBER OF HITS. IT IS FREQUENTLY RESISTED AND I GUESS THE LEVEL CAP IS STILL IN EFFECT POST 50. <P>AT 55 IN EPIC ENCOUNTERS YOU WILL BE RESISTED MORE THAN HALF THE TIME, EVEN IF YOU ARE USING THE "RIGHT" LURE. THIS IS NOT ALMOST BY ANY DEFINITION I CAN ASCERTAIN. THIS IS MORE LIKE "IT MIGHT HIT SOMETIMES WHEREAS ALL YOUR OTHER SPELLS WILL BE TOTALLY GUARANTEED RESISTED.<P><BR>FOR A CLASS THAT HAS BEEN UNTOUCHED SINCE BETA, THIS IS JUST NOT AN ACCEPTABLE FIX TO DEFINE THE WIZARD AND BOTH KUNARK AND VELIOUS POINT THIS OUT.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I hope Im not late. Im going to make this short and sweet, please read it.<P>All cleric offense is magic based (DD, Blind, stun, root..ect..) With everything being based off MR much like the enchanter. We have a problem being effective. In both player vs game and player vs player. Yes we are defensive, our spells show it, DD is bad mana to dmg ratio and has bad cast time and bad rescast time. Its okay. We are deffensive. But atleast the enchanter gets a TASHAN line to help them out. We get nothing. How about giving us a tashan line or making our spells less resistable. We are having big problems with this. Think about it, the only other class that is all MR is enchanter,and they get tashan. We suck as it is, but not being able to break through resistance makes our combat spells useless.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OK guys as I read through all these posts I see one type of argument that is purely non-productive:<P>"Class XXXX should get skill XXXX because or RP_ReasonXXXX"<P>For instance:<P>"Clerics should get standing meditation because a cleric's god would be watching them and helping them get mana"<P>"Druids get heals because nature heals and grows"<P>Every single one of these arguments has absolutely no basis in GAME BALANCE.  Whatever impact these views had ended once verant made the classes and defined them so long ago.  As it is now I see every other post claiming that clerics (or whatever class) should get / should not have some random ability because of some random roleplaying justification.<P>In all of your arguments about why clerics (or any class) should or should not have a given ability, please use objective BALANCE related issues.  Not some hooey about how random_god00 should give you your random_ability03. I can garauntee you absor is skipping any post that starts out that way.  Well absor actually seems to read EVERYTHING so I guess I wouldn't go that far, but he SHOULD be skipping posts like that. I would.<P>---------------------<P>Clerics should get some form of mana regen (be it standing or otherwise) because:<P>Every caster class in the game already has it.  Why do they have it?  Because verant obviously saw a need for faster mana regen at higher levels. If there is such a need for faster mana regen at higher levels clerics should get some type of mana regen ability.  If these are NOT the reasons verant gave shamand and druids their mana regen then clerics should NOT get it AND verant should look at exactly WHY druids and shamans DO get it. (i.e. perhaps take it away in the balancing)<P><BR>Clerics need better melee:<P>Balance: We do not last appreciably longer than any 'pure caster' (nec/mage/wiz/ench) when higher level mobs rip into us, and the reason we last that extra hit or two is because we have symbol.<P>Cleric should be:<P>int caster &lt; cleric &lt; hybrid/melee<P>We were given (a) defensive skill and the ability to wear plate based items to this end.  Note: clerics can not be any of the larger races, which gives any random shaman better tanking ability than us.<P>Solution: Up the dodge skill.  Up the defense skill.  Give us another defensive skill if necessary.<P>What many at verant don't seem to realize is that as you approach and pass 50 is when a lot of balance issues occur.  Gaps widen between some (hybrids/tanks) gaps close much too far between others (clerics/druids/shamans -- note I am FOR giving druids/shamans more heals).<P>Take a level 50 or so cleric and do some tests with how often/how hard they get hit by a variety of monsters.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Nice list. Glad to see a lot of needed changes in there...<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;ITEM: Standing Meditation.<P>Honestly, a mana "boost" spell along the lines of Harvest wouldn't be bad but this would be ok. The whole point is we have no way to recover mana quickly. We are totally dependant upon other classes for that. This is odd since clerics are supposed to get their power from their deity. Something along these lines would be good.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;ITEM: Defense skills.<P>DESCRIPTION: Higher dodge and defense skills. This, in conjunction with giving the cleric bash, might allow them to get into the fight more often. If so, it seems more appropriate to raise parry than dodge.<P>We don't get parry and I'm not really sure we'd NEED parry. Dodge and Defense would do just fine. Parry would be nice but please don't add it in and cap it at an unusable level. That's why we asked for the Dodge increase instead. Put Dodge at 200 and it would become useful (especially since melees exceed 200).<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;ITEM: Bash.<P>DESCRIPTION: Combined with somewhat higher defensive skills, this might allow a cleric to jump into the fight more often.<P>Another "would be nice to have but not necessary" thing. Would make sense tho since clerics never use 2h Blunt.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;ITEM: Unswerving Hammer of Faith.<P>DESCRIPTION: Perhaps this spell should be re-evaluated as if it was a DoT. But, as with the Wizard flaming sword pet, perhaps this can be made more interesting and useful DoT by making the hammer immune to AoE spells and riposte. This way it will only die if it gets up on the hate list. Used this way, it would allow the cleric to 'do something' other than healing…<P>I like the AoE thing. Here's by 2cp...<P>Make the spell cost 250 mana and give the pet 500 HP but retain the suicide bit. This makes the pet much more viable and allows it to survive more than 1 round for non-boss combat.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;ITEM: Stuns.<P>DESCRIPTION: Stun spells, like charms and mesmerization spells, become useless on certain powerful creatures. Perhaps stun spells could be made at least somewhat effective where they are currently useless, giving clerics (and a few other classes) something more to do in those battles. The 58th level spell, Enforced Reverence, might be a good candidate for a ‘lure’ level of resistance on a stun spell. Changes to the general Magic Resistance in Velious item might remove the need for this item.<P>I seriously doubt you'd change all the magic resists that would effect clerics. <P>Besides, Enforced Reverence is an awful spell otherwise. Allowing it to be Lure, magic resist change or not, would assure us of something to help on raids besides healing. Keep in mind that stuns are amongst the highest resist spells in the game.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;ITEM: Shield of Words.<P>DESCRIPTION: The complaint here seems to be that there is a double mana cost for a 6 point armor class increase from the previous spell. This exactly follows the pattern of the spell line, though, and may not need to be changed. Though perhaps it would be more appropriate to offer a larger armor class increase considering that the level increase, though the same, represents a much harder level range.<P>Can you also lower the casting time on it? 8 seconds is absurd. Also, a group AC buff would be helpful.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;ITEM: Mark of Karn.<P>DESCRIPTION: Perhaps a slight increase in effectiveness is in order.<P>You're funny, Absor. Have I ever told you that? This is a HUGE understatement. The spell, at present, returns about 80HP/min. I'm not kidding. If someone casts it you can't even see a noticable difference. And that assumes that you can get the spell to stick. It's still highly resisted.<P>We want it restored to around 8-10 HP/hit but leave the primary hand restriction. Honestly, nobody kicked paladins and SKs out over this spell before the nerf.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;ITEM: Abolish Disease.<P>DESCRIPTION: They want the 49th level shaman spell. The question here is, is the curing of disease the exclusive area of the Shaman?<P>Do the following test... roll up a shaman and a cleric and stick them in Oasis. Make them level 20 or so. See which character gets a tell first about curing disease.<P>I don't even see how this is unbalancing to let clerics have the best cure in the game vs disease. Clerics shouldn't be denied this. Moreover, I really don't see how this cuts into shaman uniqueness.<P>Also, can we get Counteract Disease placed on cleric vendors since we can already cast it? Many clerics don't have this spell for this reason.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;ITEM: Deity specific spells.<P>DESCRIPTION: Similar to the Temple Gate idea. Create a unique line of spells for each god that can only be cast by clerics that worship that god. They would have to be balance with each other and still be unique and representative of the individual god, so they might be very hard to balance.<P>Doesn't have to be a spell. In fact, I really don't want a spell. What I would like is a quest along the lines of the Regent Symbol of Innoruuk for all clerics. It would result in a decent item (probably neck) that would cast a certain spell or have a certain effect.<P>Two other options<P>1. Make the imbued jewelry have an effect on it. As it is, most of it will never be made since it either costs too much (ie Mith Marr clerics and Diamonds) or has negative stats (ie Bertox clerics and Rubies). This would expand what many consider just another useless money sink.<P>2. Tailored robes utilizing imbued gems. Make a new model and, depending on the deity, change the color. Each robe would have its own effect, be cleric-deity only and would make clerics more distinct from the common "Barney" look. This offers clerics both an incentive to build a tradeskill AND offers us another use for the Imbue spell AND allows clerics to differentiate themselves AND expands roleplay options for clerics. It's a win situation all around. Heck, throw in a quest piece if you want. I know many, many clerics (including myself) who would do it just for the look and roleplay.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt; Unaddressed issues...<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;Yaulp stacking<P>Yaulp does not stack with some spells, most notably Armor of Protection.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt; Donal's armor drop rates<P>Tho class armor drop rates seem to be a problem it is a major problem for clerics. Please investigate and increase the drop rates to match the drop rate of arms (except, of course, BPs and legs)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Another Idea,<BR>How about this.  Since we are clerics.  It would make sence for us to carry around a holy symbol of out diety.  Maybe have it (when wielded, reduce the cost of healing or damage and add a bonus)  It could even depend on the deity.  So if you worshiped Brell you could heal for less and have a slight bonus to the healing spells.  But if you worshipped a god like Innoruk you might be able to get a bonus and reduced casting when you cast your banish/retrobution type spells since he is a diety who like to cause harm. =).  <P>ie<BR>Symbol of Brell<BR>SLOT: Hand<BR>Effect: 5% reduction in abjuration, 5% bonus to healing<BR>Stats:  maybe a few stats  4Wis, and some saves to poison etc.<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I like most of the proposed actions and concerns.<P>ITEM: Standing Meditation.<BR>ITEM: Bind Wounds.<P>The only real need for this (from a balance point of view) is to allow clerics to Bind Wounds while medding. Note that increasing the cap for Bind Wounds still leaves it useless, since medding/healing still heals more HP than Bind Wounds, over time. If you can't make it so Bind Wounds time is also med time for clerics, how about make it so that if clerics are standing but not fighting or medding, then they are medding. You might make this a level-based attribute, like medding without the book; perhaps at level 45 or 50. That way, even if other classes want the ability, giving it to them won't overbalance them relative to the non-casting classes.<P><BR>ITEM: Unswerving Hammer of Faith.<P>I suggest either lowering the mana cost, or extending its life.<P><BR>ITEM: Bash.<BR>ITEM: Symbol of Naltron.<BR>ITEM: Shield of Words.<BR>ITEM: Invisibility (personal only).<BR>ITEM: Lull Spells.<BR>ITEM: Holy Armor / Spirit Armor / Guard / Armor of Faith / Shield of Words / Bulwark of Faith line of armor spells<P>From a balance point of view, I see no reason to change/add anything concerning these items.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OK... I missed the actual cleric threads because of RL issues, but a few of things stand out here as simply misjudged. I won't cover every good point though, this has been done already I think.<P>1) Yaulp- why even bother changing this in any way? What cleric actually uses it past Yaulp 1 (even then I personally didnt...)? Everyone knows this was only included to benefit palladins, it is just irrelevent to, us so don't bother even tampering with it if balancing the cleric class is the issue. <P>2) Temple tp- yes plz, a small benefit but a nice one. <P>3) Hammer 'pets'- this spell is just useless, even with the adjustments planned. Why not simply give us a real pet equivilent to a enchanters? While not overpowering us, this would at least make us capable of soloing if forced to.<P>3) Class envy- Why are you worried about every other class saying 'I want this!' when talking about standing med? It seems ok to strip away what makes a cleric special by slowly spreading our abilities around the other classes, but you seem a little more concerned about upsetting the others. Standing med is a great idea, so plz dont let it be destroyed by this line of thinking. <P>4) Invisibily (self)- bascically a good idea, but combine this with a sow speed run and lev in a 'change self' spell (maybe like an angel with wings? I dont know... call it 'Avatar' or somthing) and you would at least make us mobile enough to count. Sure make the regeant expensive, even remove offensive capabilities while in this form, but please consider it (unlikely I know...)<P>5) A late small wish- Yeah, I know the class threads are closed, but like I say I missed them, so I would like a cleric Wisdom buff to be considered for the future. Why why why do clerics not recieve a wis buff (akin to a chanters)?? What class better to bring enlightenment to themselves and other wisdom casters? Plz dont mention that this would take away from chanters, I am not asking for clarity here (though even that could be reasonably argued...), I really think the enchanter would survive us recieving this logical spell. <P>Overall, I wont even begin to say how sad the treatment of the cleric in this game makes me. When druids and shaman complain about the lack of clerics and true heals at high levels, what do you do? Enhance them instead of us, and thus failing to fix the lack of clerics by actually making people want to play one. Unbelievable. The cleric is the most poorly treated class in the game, not even rezzes make us special. Clerics embody the 'group play' philosophy that Verant time and time again pushes, but time and time again we are ignored while the soloing classes are enhanced. Go figure.<P>As a final point, I really have no desire to 'jump into combat' when in a group, I chose a cleric not a warrior, so please stop thinking along these lines for a cleric. Too many points here are aimed at 'giving us something to do' in combat, and this is just silly. Just give us something to do in our current role of tank support and I will be happy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>as far as the summon hammers are concerned, this is a possible solution:<P>1st hammer, add ranged to it(primary and ranged slot), at range of 50<BR>2nd hammer, range 60, and stackable (10 stacks)<BR>3rd hammer, ammo/range(primary,ranged,ammo) 75, stackable, wieght .1 (10 stacks)<BR>4th hammer, ammo/range 150, stackable 20, wieght .1, summons 20 at a cast.<P>3rd and 4th can go in either ranged or ammo slot like shurkiens. There are currently no practical thrown weapons in the game for clerics.  The D&D sling just in not present in the game, this is a good substitution, and does not have any major impact on the game.<P>I am not sure of stats on stackable items, I believe it is not possible, so I do not recommend any kind of stats or abilities on these items. The final hammer could/should be given stats about 1 and 1/2 times better than the previous, as it is the last. Lets face it, giving these items to clerics is not going to create a balance issue, at most its a party toy, but at least its something we can enjoy some.<P>All should stay no drop, but lose lore.<P>final note. Clerics are not other classes, do not give us dots, pets, snare, gate etc.  We do not need this class blending, as all these ideas come from envy, not "balance". also consider reviewing the placement of sup heal for sham/drus to be at 49/50 as that would be more in line with the rest of the healing spells (10 levels late) and allow non-kunark/velious owners to cast them as well.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This whole thing has pointed out some things to me.<P>We are the ONLY pure casters without a mana regen of some form.<P>We are one of only 2 classes without some form of useable invis or invis effect item.<P>We are supposed to be thankfull that they moved our skill caps up to equal druids and shaman in combat some time ago when originally we were weaker than Int casters for Offense and weaker than Druid/Shaman for Defense.<P>We are the weakest class offensively in the game. (alright someone has to be the weakest and it makes sense for it to be clerics), but on a personal survival level we are the weakest defensively as well.  We cannot effectively heal ourselves in combat.  We cannot outrun MOBS.  We cannot evade,invis,lev,hide(for the most part).  <BR>If we get jumped by greens we cannot adequately defend ourselves.<P>We cannot safely travel from point A to point B past green mobs.<P>We are nothing but walking dynamic hp pools and it appears that Verant is using the cleric class as a major fulcrum to control the speed and balance of the game.  I can dynamically provide 2khp to any char in my group that needs them, but cant effectively use them myself.  So without someone else to give the HPs to we are mostly useless.<P>That is so wrong on so many levels and I think that is why there are so many frustrated Clerics.<P>I love my Cleric.  I enjoy playing my cleric.  I like the Job of healer.  That does not mean the class is balanced.  My greatest complaint when playing my cleric in small groups is I feel like I am contributing half of what some other healing class could contribute.  I am slightly better than the healing half of a druid without the other utility,  I am slightly better than the healing half of a Shaman without their flexability.  Sometimes I feel less than a full character.<P>Irregardless of healing changes to other classes the healing abilities of the class alone do not make it a full character.<P>We are a parent class with one unique but powerful ability of CH that has limited useability and does not help us, ourselves, at all.  We cannot even stun a mob reliably enough or long enough to heal ourselves in combat. Let alone combat well enough to make use of the HPs healed if we could.  <BR>	Everything else we do has been Distributed to other classes.  Rezzes have been given out to Necros(with a stupid component cost), and Paladins.  In High level AC/HP buffs Druids surpass us and can use their buffs for healing just like we do.  Now our most usefull heals will go to Shaman/Druids (not that they dont need some heal improvement).<P>Clerics are by far the most demanded 75% of a class in the game.  I mean we are 75% pure Caster, 25% .....ummm, hmmmmm.... well we definately have the functionality of about 75% of the other pure casters.<P>I want some cheese and bread to go with my sacrificial wine!<P>Tfodthog Tmfof<BR>28 Cleric of Brell<P>Can some of you higher level clerics give me an idea when this feeling goes away?

</FONT><HR>Well, I really just wanted to stress how disappointed I am. No I'm not here to gripe about boredom of our class, or that we need changes. What I am here to stand against is how it seems like the common consensus of you, Absor, and Verant is that Clerics are balanced.<P>I fully agree right now, that as Clerics are implemented, they are balanced. But I looked at the new changes that have been made to Shamans and Druids, as well as what changes they have proposed, all in relation to that which has been proposed for our class. I honestly find it disheartening.<P>It makes us clerics feel like we are losing our power as healers. Sure, maybe Druids and Shamans don't have great heals. But look at what other powers they have to draw from. Now take that and compare it to Clerics. What you're doing is in a sense, unbalancing us clerics in exchange for more balance among Shamans and Druids.<P>They have a huge amount of flexibility and diversity in their roles as a class. What do we clerics have? Not much. No that's not a request for new lines of spells here, but I mean, taking away our only advantage, in the slightest bit, from the other healers really sucks.<P>With that point down, I'll try and suggest some new things that would make the cleric class a lot more fun and balanced to play, this would be in addition to what you have up there. <P>Comment on current additions<P>As a note, I REALLY like the Defense, Dodge/Parry and Bash additions. The self-gate to deity specific temples is... ok.<P>Anyway, here goes nothing:<P>Group Buffs <P>(!!!) I really think we could use more groupwide buffs. I know we have Heroic Bond at high levels, but how about for the AoF/SoW armor line of spells? I think we could really use this as a group buff. <P>AoF/SoW line of spells<P>I feel that the mana cost to the AC benefit in this line of spells is kind of overrated. It makes this spell a lil bit controversial in casting it. I tend to only cast this very selectively because I usually find myself completely OOM if I ever decide to cast this one. <P>Short Burst Heals<P>I think we could use quick to cast healing spells (inefficient). It would really help. There's been a lot of situations when I've just been too slow to cast the spell, but have had enough mana to definitely heal. It would prove useful.<P>Resist Group buff<P>I think we could use a spell that could either buff an entire group with a particular resist spell, or maybe a single target buff that buffs all resists. It would really help in terms of reducing the time needed to cast it. It's kind of tedious to cast it individually, knowing that practically all party members will either need or want it.<P>Mana Regen<P>I know the suggestion to med while standing is one that stands out as an option already and I can see that it's most likely not going to be added, because of the complaints from other casting classes. As an alternative, I was thinking perhaps allow us to have a wisdom buff? Some sort of boon of wisdom granted from the gods. I don't know it's just an idea. Since the rate at which we regain mana is dependent on total mana, increasing our total mana through a wis buff would increase our mana regeneration rate by some factor. I'm not quite sure how it's calculated so, I'm not sure how beneficial this would be. But it's a thought.<P>Summon Bandages<P>Pretty much self-explanatory. This could help in OOM situations, if we could bind wounds and med at the same time. Not sure how useful this could be. But it would help save on mana during downtimes if we could bandage while medding.<P>Short burst regeneration spells<P>I think we need more spells along the Celestial heal line. I really love the idea. Less aggro. Enough said.<P>That's about all I can really think of for now. I'll post more suggestions as they come.

</FONT><HR>Perhaps it's a little late, but I just found this thread.  My 2cp on somethings that might make the class a little more fun.  While people are bantering back forth over healing we are still without peer in rezzing.  In order to help us in that aspect how about a means of finding somebody's corpse?  My idea in keeping with the divine assistance theme would be to have a means of tracking all the corpses in the zone you are in, just like a rangers tracking.  Help us to help others, it is why we chose the class.  Plus this way we would not need to target, or group with the player that needs help.  Make it an ability, like the rangers (but no mobs, just corpses.)  <P>Secondly, a spell I dubbed "Divine Flight."  It would give the Cleric the ability to travel out of body across the zone.  Give it SoC speed and make it so it could only be cast while sittng (to prevent auto-follow.)  It could only be used out doors to prevent them from scouting dungeons.  The clerics body would have no protection while in this state other than his party members.  Although it should stack with invis.  Also, while in this state the cleric regenerates neither HPs or Mana, or if he does than limit the flight time and recast time. The flyer would not be able to interact in any way with his surroundings.<P>Actually the two could be combined, so the soul flyer has the ability to locate corpses, don't know.  Just thinking of ways that might make it more fun.  <P>The technology already exists in the game for both, so should therefore be easy to implement.<P>I know it's probably too late to receive consideration, but what do other clerics think of the ideas?  I don't think it actually steps on anybody elses toes either, but I don't know enough about all the classes to be sure.  Post your two coppers to let me know.<P>Caladiel<BR>Favored of Karana<BR>Cleric of the 29th season, Drinal <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Chanting (standing med ... clue taken from previous post) ... is a great defensive spell ... how many times have you had full dmg hits when something agroes you when your sitting.<P>I ussually take full dmg when sitting .... then in my speed to hit the stand button ... am already standing thus start sitting ... then get another round of full dmg (people with slow links have more problems on this i think).   In fact I probably loose more dmg per round by sitting (and increasing my agroe) then if I had my defensive skill up.<P>From a class defining point, Chanting seperates us from the druids in that we can be seriously agroed yet still heal/med (i.e. when things get bad ... and you run out of mana ... you can still med ... often when things go crazy I just can't sit down).  Also when things agro you won't take as bit of hit ... since you normally would be sitting ... like the druids.<P>Anyway, Chanting I think is far better then infringing on bards and enchanters mana spells ... we should focus on things that make us more effective while not swiping from other classes and also not imbalancing the game.<P>Anyway it looks like Verant has read these post and put some valid concerns/criticism/sugestions together.<P>I think chanting is class defining, in that clerics are the only class that has extreme problems kiting (yes i can kite but it's not as efficient as grouping) ... thus standing med would not imbalance us (i.e. if a wizard had standing med then they would be able to kite much more effectively).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>All I can say is that all casters other than clerics both have invis in some form or fashion... Gather Shadows for necros, Camo for druids, invis for mages, wizards, enchanters, and i believe shaman also, but if shaman don't have it, they can easily make a potion for it.  All Clerics have is invis vs undead, which isn't too useful when there isn't even a handfull of zones with the main critters being undead. <P>It's the same way for faster mana gain, Wizards have harvest, enchanters have clarity, druids have their wolf forms, shaman has cannabalize and some other spell that does it, necros have their allure line, mages have their armor buffs later on that give mana regen.<P>Clerics meditate the most out of any other class in the game, and they don't get nothing to help them out.<P>It shouldn't "unbalance" the game if clerics were to get some form of each, it would just put them in par with all the other casters.  And the idea of having "prayer" for mana regen, could be a self only spell or something like clarity, and invis, well, like someone said before, what use is it of having a god if he/she can't even hide or protect you while you are doing duties of your faith.<P>Just my thoughts<BR>~Savil Ashkevron<BR>Mischievious lil cleric on Lanys<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have read every post, see some things I agree with and others I disdain. I do not care if they improve Druids or Shamans. All I care about is making my class a little more fun and less tedious. That's what the game is all about so why not throw Clerics a bone for once. Give us a little something back, because no one has had more taken away. Standing medditation would actually allow was to use the weapons we can summon and the defensive abilitys and higher AC we are given. I see no reason not to recieve this since we do derive our power directly from our God. I also see no unbalancing concerns with recieving this. Invisibility. I'm sorry but this just makes the game a little less tedious and a little more fun to play. And allowing your consumers a break though it does'nt fit into your vision will go a long way in gaining many consumers respect that you made their gaming experiece a little less frustrating. Heck even warriors have a way to invis. Just grant invisibility as a 44th circle since we do not get much then. Mark of Karn...I still do not see the logic in this nerf. I respect many things Verant does in the name of balance. I even see why Donals was nerfed. But if you look at the typical raid party you wont find many Paladins or Sk's anyway. Why? cause the arent needed or wanted in many cases. And the nerfing of this spell did'nt change that. Anyway I hope the masters of balance read this. Nothing here would affect balance. However it would make playing a little more enjoyable. Thanks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I was looking at a website and it listed what is I think supposed to be the issues for cleric balancing. The main problem is that none of them are what all the clerics I know want to see reviewed. I am not going to post a novel here, but I am gonna list 2 or 3 things with that 'good reason' that people seem to just gloss over.<BR>Cleric are reasonable balanced below 50. Clerics above 50 need more utility spells, and more diversity for the group outside of just healing, and clerics need a slight increase in offensive power post 50. <P>Druids and shamans are 2nd class healers post 50, OK give them those new heals if you like, BUT if this happens you MUST then balance clerics outside the group, as you balanced druids and shamans to be more group freindly. Balance should not be a one way street. Clerics can not invis while all other casters (except paladins) can invis and most get invis to undead later as well. It is ridiculous that at 55 I can barely make a run through upper guk without almost dieing, while all others can easily. It is unbalancing to require a post 50 class to have to have an inviser follow them around.<BR>Clerics currently can only ac/hp buff, heal in the group setting. Druids on the other hand can heal, dot, buff, port, invis, AND do serious DD. Clerics NEED more diversity on the odd chance 2 are in the same group so the other one can do something. Sure clerics are scarce what with them being the hardest class to level and a servent slave to all others and the fact that they cost tons of plats jsut to fullfill their role on raids and they cant' do anythign cool at all, but hey the other day there were actually 2 of us in a group. We tried stunning, but since every post 50 mob has RM that makes us casting a total waste we had to settle for alternating doing buffs. Come on Verant get real every other class post 50 has multiple roles with the possible exception of the warrior. <BR>Clerics stuns should be MUCH MUCH MUCH less resisted. Post 50 their ability to kill and handle undead is no better than the ability to deal out damage to live creatures. The cleric was supposed to be a master undead killer all the way, after 50 all other classes can do more damage to undead for less mana. Doesn't anyone see at least this as a problem?<BR>Clerics should also get group RM at mid 50s, not group resist disease or poison or fire or cold. This keeps the priest classes co dependent. Shaman poison and disease, druids fire and cold, clerics magic. <BR>Druid top level group buff and shaman is BETTER than a cleric. This is not right, no clarity, etc on cleric buffs. Clerics should get a slight clarity effect too or something.<BR>Last, its not complicated, just give clerics invis after 50, make their DD and stuns slightly less resisted so they can offer some damage in a fight post 50, and significantly increase the damage to undead. Give clerics 4 spells post 45 that are fun. (a pet that is at least as good as a druids, summon wine and feast, port to home temple, and bash). And finally, fix the lull line. Does anyone not think these things are broken/useless. Can someone give me ONE instance post 30 where you would use it??? It fails more than any other spell in the game, and the price of failure is a trian everytime. Make it work like harmony but single target. Hell, make it resisted 1/2 the time, but agroing everything is nuts. <BR>You druids and shaman want to play sit heal sit heal sit heal OK by me, in fact great you heal. I would like to do something else. Of course my guild has cleared 95% of Fear with only one cleric, I dont' know maybe you guys just need to learn how to play your class instead of asking Verant to just give you more spells. I think its sad that a druid makes it to 55 or so and can't play his class well enough to be desired. My druid friends are. Maybe if the class wasn't so easy that any player with a bit of common sense and 2 weeks to kill can get one to 50, they would slow down and learn how to play and Verant wouldn't have to buff them every couple weeks.<P>Chaocle 55 cleric<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Going to say it again, clerics are the only casting class with out some form of mana generation.  Enchanters, necromancers, magicians, wizards, Druids and Shamans have some way to generate mana.  Clerics have an INCREDIBLE amount of down time after buffing a party up.  Proposal: give clerics a mana regeneration that is used for the specific intent of regaining mana after a buff cycle.  Mana regeneration that does not improve mana generation during combat (except for extended combat... but then people are hit for BIG damage if it's an extended combat.)<P><BR>Suggested Cleric Mana Geneartion:<P>Divine Commune (or Divine Rapture)- Cleric kneels and stays that way (use the spell partical effect from dizzying wind radiating from self) (note: kneeling is important so that everyone can see they are not just medding, but communing or in rapture).  Standing up cancels the spell effect.  "&lt;your name here&gt; begins to commune with his deity" or "&lt;your name here&gt; is in divine rapture."  Mana regeneration equivalent to clarity 1 (or 2) + mana generation gained from sitting and medding traditionally.  No spell icon, so stacks with enchanter clarity and 55th bard song.  Level 55.  What this does is improve meditation rate with the addition of clarity 1 (or 2) effect, but only works during kneeling (same getting hit for big damage penalty like from sitting) with a great vulnerability factor built in.  Now the downside, mana cost 120 (more or less) mana, - 200 AC, stunned for 20 ticks, 6 minute recast time.  So, sure the benefit of clarity is there, but cleric is very vulnerable during the duration of the spell.  Kneeling is broken when hit (melee damage, spell damage or breath AoE damage... like medding getting broken) with full damage hits incurred like when getting hit while sitting/medding, then the AC penalty further leaves cleric vulnerable during the stun period.  6 minute recast time means the spell consumes a valuable spell slot.  Can make the spell more user friendly with less mana cost or less recast time or less stun time.  This lets cleric regain mana better after a buff cycle, but not during a period where healing needs to be done.  Also, a quested holy talisman (ranged slot) can be a required component as well.<P><BR>Mark of Karn suggestion:<P>I believe the main reason for the MoK nerf was that people where using it to power level newbie characters.  To make MoK more effective at higher levels and of no benefit to newly made characters, there should be some scaling involved.  Make it so that the amount of hps gained per hit is dependent on the level of the encounter.  For example:<P>level 1 to 20 NPC:  Zero hit points gained per hit<BR>level 21 to 30 NPC:  2 hit points gained per hit<BR>level 31 to 40 NPC:  4 hit points gained per hit<BR>level 41 to 50 NPC:  8 hit points gained per hit<BR>level 51 to 55 NPC:  12 hit points gained per hit<BR>level 56 to 60 NPC:  16 hit points gained per hit<BR>level 61 to 65 NPC:  20 hit points gained per hit<BR>level 65+ NPC:  24 hit points gained per hit (if there are NPCs this high)<P>A scale like this makes MoK work as intended.  Level check can be done I'm sure, after all it is part of the factor involved with calculating if spells get resisted when casting DDs on NPCs (isn't it?), so level check can be done to make the scale work.  Not to mention level checks are done when conning NPCs as well, so it's not like level check is something that can't be done or would be something new.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here are my suggestions:<P>Curse line of spells.  Lowers target ac or attack ability.  Allows the cleric to get involved with the combat and give them a little more flexability.  Note the shaman and enchanter still have the best mob debuffs in the game.  This will just allow us to assist the group a little in the fight.<P>Change the reckless strength line of spells.  Remove the negetive effect from the spell.  It should be a boon to the person.  This will allow us to help our tanks when a druid or shaman is not in the group.  Not a balance issue since the spell gives less strength than the other "healer" spells and has a much shorter duration.  Will also mean these spells might actually get cast.<P>Lower greater heal from 24 to 19. This will help a cleric group in some of his or her toughest lower levels (20 to 33).<P>Have revive return about 20 percent experience.  This will allow 29 level clerics to experience rez people his level and make the pali rez actually usful.<P>Return mark of Karn to its original form.  Another idea is to lower the level to say 50 or 51 and make it undead only.  Of coarse with this change you should actually make high level undead encounters and more undead dungeons.<P>The lull line should be more effective. This would allow the cleric to get a little more movement in areas.  This would benefit palis more because after 20 level clerics do not pull.<P>Undead DD's should do more damage for the mana cost.<P>Expand on the undead dot line.  Make them line more powerful.  Turning of the unatural is very inefficient and almost usless compared to the shaman and necro dots of similar level.  The argument again arises, are we the masters of destroying undead or not.<P>AOE word line should have more damage added. Very pathetic for the level.  Again never cast.<P>Symbol components should cost less or be removed.<BR>Enough said on this one.<P>Group resistance and ac buffs. We are the master buffers.<P>A "Prayer" spell.  Allows us to regen mana faster.<P>Stun line should be more effective at higher levels.  This is one of our few main lines that could help us alot.  These should effect more creatures and be resisted less.<P>The hammer of unswerving faith should not be able to be killed by a mob period.  The hammer should have no taunt value and should poof at the end of combat.  Leave the mana cost as is.  A large raid fight only last about 30 sec.  The hammer is usless in these encounters.  The main use for the hammer is to destroy a green mob.  Maybe help kill a low blue mob.  The mana cost is so high on this that any other use would make it worthless.<P>Lower level hammer spells should have increasingly powerful procs as well as damage and delay.<P>A spell called Turn undead.  Make it a fear/snare spell that lasts 18 sec.  This should be a post 50 spell.  Again this shows our superiority to the undead.<P>Add a time component to atone.  In close combat this is usless.  You atone the mob and almost instantly it argos on you.  Add an 18 sec mez effect to this.  This would be nice to allow us to move past creatures and let us do a small amount of crowd control.<P>A bless line that raises the attac skill of the target.  This just sounds right.<P>A lower level bless weapon skill.  That allows a weapon to hit as magical.<P>A high level fire based attack DD.<P>Healing effects on divine aura and divine barrier.  Also, lower the recast time from 15 minutes to 10 minutes.  Since no other spells can effect us and every cleric I know casts this at the last second, the cleric is fairly low on life.  The second this wears off if the mobs are not dead then the cleric is instantly argoed on.  With the heal component this spell would be more beneficial.<P>More cleric specific items at lower levels (10-40).<P>Make droped items for armor quest only able to be picked up by that class.  This will end the druids camping other classes armor quests.<P>More diety specific imbues or effects.<P>As far as post 50 spells.<P>Death Pact-Make it work every time for a small amount of healing.<P>Banishment of shadows should have no component cost or leave a corpse.<P>...other ideas<P>Make a totem or holy symbol that allows a cleric to bypass spell components.  This would be like a mage focus and be a quest item.<P>Fix Donals armor since it has been nerfed way to much.  Add invis to a peice.  Add other beneficial effects to peices.<P>Suggestion for the Donal BP now.  Since it takes 10 sec to cast complete heal and it takes 400 mana to do so,  have the breast plate give a 50 mana boost every 8 sec (Like cann but without the character taking damage) this would give the item a 4 sec cast time and a 4 sec recover time.  This will allow the cleric to have a mana regain like the other classes and not make the BP to powerful(your words).  It would take a cleric 10 sec to cast complete heal and 40 sec to get his mana back and another 10 sec to cast complete heal again.  1 min is a long time in a battle.  If you do not like this maybe adjust the casting time.<BR>10 sec for a complete heal and 5 sec cast time with 5 sec recover time.  That would mean 80 sec to get mana back and a total of 100 sec from start of first CH to the end of second CH.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My only gripe is that you didn't look for other solutions to the cleric hammer/pet problem!!! We DO NOT need an offensive pet. We aren't an offensive class and the  hammers should reflect that! <P>You could make ALL hammers more use and give cleric a bit of unique personality by making them different from every other weak pet in the game!<P>Have a hammer that only taunts... Maybe one that only has a chance to reposte an attack made against its owner or selected target... Be creative! Clerics aren't Paladins with bad weapon skills. PLEASE rethink the whole hammer ideology.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I would also like to say that when grouped I spend 40% of my time healing and the rest medditating, and my contribution to the battle is stricly healing, not that thats a bad thing but I would like to get into battle a lil more often  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>yea i hate to say it but there will be nothing that makes us stand out after this so called balancing takes place, save reviscience and complete heal. what used to make clerics unique were their ressing abilities and their healing. yea its nice that druids and shamans can heal better, they did need it, but now our worth is that much more dilluted. as i a cleric (a mid level on) i can't fight. in fact i got destroyed by a loiness at level 28 in sk. (thank god for that necro pet) our combat skills are laughable. increasing the effectiveness of a druid or shamans ability to heal, with out giving us some sort of utlity casting to offset, all but makes us useless sub-50's. i have been turned down in for groups because a shaman/druid was present. i can't wait for the higher levels. all of the other healers have something which sets them apart (tp's, evacs, alchemy, sow, etc, etc, etc). i have res. give us something that is at least fun, if not useful. i live shrink. i love lev. i love sow. i can't cast any of them, and frankly i don't really feel that it is in our domain to cast them. if you gave us the ability to to nothing more than to shape shift into a giant block of clay i'd be happy. something fun if not at least useful. can't wait to res myself as that is the only neat thing that i'll ever be doing. <P>mana regen is needed. my god is it needed. i don't care if you just give us clarity(self only) at a later level (the easy solution). but please something. <P>there is no hope for out melee efforts. i have done the same damage with the same effectiveness since level 9. i just tote around that mace cause i haven't gotten anything better. which brings me to my next point. why are cleric items impossible to get for evil clerics. does verant hate evil races? the only worthwhile sol ro armor (bracers) and the aegis of life will never see the light of day on my cleric as i have blue skin. also it seems that +int items are a lot easier to come by than any +wis, cleric items. (and so help me if you guys implment another +wis 1hb pally only item. i have yet to see a pally carrying a club)<P>to add to the list off cool things that i would like to see happen to clerics but won't as it imbalances or something, invis self and a temple gate. please at least let us move around without being a leech on another character. <P>zerky merk<BR>level 29 cleric and alcoholic (hey at least we can still drink)<BR>vazelle</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>i dont know if there is a thread on this allready, if there is ill try to find it.<BR>basically im happy with what is there, i think i only have a couple issues with all of what is on the list. <P>1. the hammer line, summoning a weapon from your god should be very powerful. maybe it should be along the lines of enchanting an existing 1h blunt (a similer ablility is being talk about on the enchanter board). but my idea is that instead of changeing the cleric summon hammer line, give us summon modulating rod (an allready existing and very useful magician spell). i dont think giving our weapons a proc will be usefull because they are self only and the weapons suck and so does our melee skils. or maybe they could have a powerful proc but then disapear after the effect. another idea is to give them a wisdom stat, this allows us to buff our own wisdom and makes the weapon worth summoning even with the awful dmg/dly.<P>2. standing med---this can easily be argued that it would make the other classes jealous. SO WHAT!! the fact is that the cleric gain thier power thru a god, not thru the power of our minds and medditation. the question should not be "are other classes gonna want this also", it should be is this gonna over power the cleric? i dont believe it will. the cleric is not an awsome melee force, not enough that if they are in the fight instead of medding that they will become all powerful. the cleric are bored to death, and this will add some well deserve attraction to the class and bring them up to par on the balance issue. <P>some things i was disapionted to not see on the list was: <BR>1. mana regen issue (every class except the cleric have mana regen).---mod rods would help a little.<BR>2. lack of soloing abiltiy was over looked or ignored completly. (angel form-sow and levitate. self only would help).<BR>3. undead only dmg spells should be more powerful (if you are soo specialized at something you should be better at it than anyone-even wizards).<BR>4. tashan line--every offensive spell we have is mr based.  every mob has high mr, (see a problem here?) i would gladly take the hits of a tash taunt if i could stun that green mob!<P>these thing and more didnt even make the wish list. i really dont think that it is fair that so many of us showed concern on these and more issues that they wernt even considered as wish list ideas.<P>over all i think alot of good will come from the changes that did make it to the the list. i am more happy than upset about the proposed changes. please take another look at the last few though, then i would feel like our opinions were not so looked over.<P>your truely <BR>evolin d'vengence<BR>52cleric rallos zek <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000392-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000392.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000392-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000392-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000392-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000392-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum14&number=14&thisthread=000392&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum14&number=14&thisthread=000392&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
