</FONT><HR>1) Fix our CF effect to stack properly, perhaps even allow it to stack with the other haste effects (spells/songs)...Allow it to be Epic. Even the damage ratio now is below several non-epic weapons.<P>2) Add another damage avoidance. Monks would not need a higher ac or worries about ac on equipment if we had another damage avoidance feature (If Block and Parry aren't linked, allow monks to parry as well as dodge/block/riposte)<P>3) Allow FD to work in multi-group encounters or allow it to have an evade typer effect such as you are currently considering for Rogues as FD seems to never work with others in melee range of the mob.<P>4) Fix our disciplines please, reevaluate them and the +2 regen while feigned with the Warrior/Rogue stun kick/triple attack and double backstab/assasinate.<P>5) Put a minimum on flyingkick/thunderkick please. Its embarassing to be a Discipline/Master/Grandmaster and have kicks that can't kill a large rat.<P>6) Perhaps some movement adjus6tment for monsk with their carry capacity reduced as it is...or make the ac even go higher when below the 14/18/22 weight limit to make equipment even less wanted.<P>7) Please review the write up on what monks are about. Allow us to shun weapons once again and make the character into that perfect weapon.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>1. I disagree with changing the weight constraints based on level. I would rather see it as something that we have control over. When starting out at level 1 (for humans)we have 80 str, 80 sta, 85 dex, 85 agi and 20 bonus points to spend. If you add those up you get 350 points. Taking our weight limit of 14 pounds we can generate a percentage that refelcts our attributes in our weight limit. For 350 points it becomes 4%.<P>I am level 53 and currently have 143 str, 107 sta, 127 agi, and 141 dex. At 4% this would equate to a weight limit of roughly 20.7 stones. This clearly shows that by having higher stats we are more agile, dexterous, stronger, and have more endurance to fight with heavier gear.<P>2. The second request that I would like to see is allow any vendor to coin up for you. I can't tell you how many times I have gone to a store and turned pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters into dollars. I was never limited to doing this at a bank. Heh, I would even like to add Velium currency so that 10pp=1vp.<P>3. I agree strongly with raising our dodge/block/riposte/defense/offense caps to 252 and help reinforce that we are not tanks. However, I would give us the skill parry as well. I would have it capped at 252. The trick here, is that we use weapons now. The other classes got parry since they used weapons. This skill would only be active when weilding weapons and would help offset the PENALTY we alone as monks face when using weapons due to there weight.<P>4. The weight of several Monk items needs to be looked at. The Collar of Neshika at 1.5 weight is insane. If it weighed .1 or .2 and had 5 ac rather than 4 it may actually be used. Tranquil Staff...10!, Treant Fists .7, still to heavy for a monk, Black Pantherskin armor is overall to heavy.<P>5. The weight reducing box dropped in Hate or Fear (can't remember) should weigh 0-.4 like the dragon bags do.<P>Gillead De'Paten</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1. I fully support the Zad/Bodi Post.<P>2. Either lower the weight of some "MNK" equipable items, or remove "MNK" from the approved "use" list. ie.. a 10.0 stone weapon, or a 9.0 stone cloak cannot realistically be used by a Monk.<P>3. Put Monks back to what the "vision" of the class was before Kunark... ie... Make the Monk's Body the weapon!!!  Monks should fight with their hands, feet, and fists.  Make us once again the best toe to toe damage dealer.  We used to be, but we are not anymore.<P>I think the Zad/Bodi post said all this, and more.  I also think most of the Monk community is in agreement with it.<P>Please restore us to what we were... MONKS... the best at dealing damage, toe to toe... bar none.  The monk should be a pure fighter, not a meat shield, not a tank, but a pure whirlwind with hands and feet damage.<P>Please fix FD while you're at it.  Ask any monk, FD above L50 mobs is a joke.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I was going to avoid this whole issue.  But Haste on Shurikens?  What the hell is this?  Is this some hidden implementated increase or are you just mis-informed Absor?  What do Monks want?  Thats what this whole thread is about.  Fine I will tell you what this monk wants.  <P>1.  I want you to have a clue about monks.  What we do in a group and What we do Solo.  <BR>    <BR>    a.  Grouped.  7 times out of 10, taking into account location and skill of the monk involved we are the pullers.  We also assist in dealing damage to the mobs.  This is what this entails.  We scout out the area, determine the pathing of the mob and bring back in controllable #s things for our group to kill.  It is our job to make sure the party survives with a safty margin for potential surprises (I.E. Dont keep your casters drained of mana).  9/10ths of the time, Im not using Feign death to pull.  Im using sneak and throwing.  I dont care about nerfing feign death for pulling.  I MIND running a mob in circles for 15 seconds, hitting feign death and it still hits me.  No fail message, not lag, I let it hit me awhile got back up, did the same thing but in a straight line, same effect, was still getting hit.  THIS WAS a GREEN Sea Fury Cyclops.  GREEN!  I dont know why it did it,  This is supposed to be a lifesaver.  I dont use it if I dont have to in a life and death situation.  Im afraid to.  I should not have that fear.  It should work when it needs to.  Its one of the prices I pay for that 14 weight restriction for 55 levels.  Its the price I pay for all that dropped, copper, silver, gold, and yes platnum.  I have a suggestion.  IT ALWAYS WORKS AT LESS THEN 1 bubble of health.  ALWAYS, NO FAIL, NO SKILL CHECK, INSTANT MEM WHIPE.  Leave the skill check in for more then 1 bubble of health.  Heck, exponate (increase it the more health monk has) make it where the monster doesnt believe you if your full health.  You see right?  You see how this would nerf Feign Pulling and not Nerf LIFE SAVING.  As far as damage goes, frankly when Im in a group, Im all for more damage being done by anybody thats in my group.  Im not competing with the fighter across from me.  What I dont want to see is other classes being constantly upgraded and encroaching on my damage lead with me being left stagnant.  If your going to improve other classes without improving mine thats not right, its not fair, and it causes way to many problems.  Here's a hint.  Increasing haste on our throwing shurikens is not an improvement.  Unless of course you have a vendor that sells 35 damage shurikans.  Throwing does little or nothing in the general damage of the encounter.<P>      <P>     b.  What we do solo.  Because we have no significant AC Items (dont point to things off Dain Iceweaver and say Yes you do.  Very few monks will actually get those.  We're discussing the majority, not the minorty).  It has been said and repeatedly by Verant that our AC is where they want it and when we do get High AC items they are usually balanced by weight factors (this proceeding was for informational purposes only, its background, its noth the main point of subsection b, haste on shurikens, that kills me.) So we cant go toe to toe with the average blue spawn at higher levels and expect to survive (yeah the monks with Uber loot can but they usually are grouped so .....).  So what I do is I use Instill Doubt.  Im very, very good at it.  Its how I survive.  Your idea of graying out the special attacks.  Not good for me.  I have basic arithmitic skills and can count to ten.  My timing is perfect.  This will "Nerf" me.  By doing this I will have to wait an extra 2-3 seconds depending on lag to use my special attack after I fear and 5-8 seconds after I special attack to Instigate my Instill doubt.  Why do I have to suffer because other people cant count.  I already have to limit my speed to 65 because other people cant drive.  I hope you seriously reconsider recommending this to the developer board.  I have adapted and learned to maximize my abilities.  I have paid for these with blood sweat and tears.  You will rip these away from me to placate the chronologically challanged.  Even with Instill doubt (just so you dont get the wrong Idea, it doesnt work all the time.  Id say my success is 1 in 5.  But I know what Im doing.  Even with ID, Im still hitting my last bubble of health before the fights over.  This change would not improve things for me.  <P>2.  Roleplay.  This is one sided.  You have evil guilds, places for non good guys to gather in human citys (sewers in qeynos and caverns in Freeport) expand our deity options and place monk trainers here.  Humans can be evil too. Im not saying make it retroactive (would be nice though if you could do a quest for a deity selection but thats not the focus of this section).  Im saying give every monk now!!!! more choices.  <P>3.  Weapons and Equipment.  No big complaints here.  I think though you can make some less effective 1 and 2 hand blunts available at lower levels.  But if those monks really want to train those skills they have options.  Have had those options since EQ release actually.  Treant Fists:  These really need to be looked at.  Please consider restoring an effect to them.  I know the CH proc was totally unbalancing but cmon.  Do a stat buff, skin like wood or something.  No drop items should never be fashion statements.  <P>4.  Quests.  A quest doesnt always have to end with retrieving an Item.  It can end with achieving a goal.  A title would be a good quest reward.  A book that gives us hints to the overall plot, that adds to our knowledge of the history of this world you've created is another that would be appropriate.  Yeah you would get a few crass people who would say this is a waste of time but who cares.  Iksar Monk quests were really well done.  Unfortunatly the were buggy as all get out throughout and when completed with the Shackle of Steel, left one feeling at a loss.  There was no sense of closure, no saying that there was nothing left to achieve.  It left us wondering.  Is there another shackle after?  Quests should not be simple but there should be at least a clue to go off of.  A new NPC in a place that only gives a short description of himself and responds to no key words he himself utters.  Okay, Now what.  We know who he is.  but we dont know when he is.  Is he step 6 of a 9 step quest?  We dont know what he wants.  Thats infuriating.  So keep that in mind when quests are made.  Take a guy/gal from the pool, sit them at step one and say go on.  They need to go through the entire quest as a player would.  Waiting on NPC spawns, turning in items, etc.  This has been the bane of quests.  Poor Testing.<P>Like I said.  These are just my thoughts, these are things I see as being relevent to me.  Maybee some of these are relevent to others.<P>By the way, Black Panther armor?  I dont know how to take this?  Are we being mocked or is there a programmer/developer on the inside secretly sympathetic to our cause.  Also.  Your comment you have to go check the vision to see what the plan is for monks.  Just go check it, dont tell us what you are doing.  Theres a fine line between honesty and credibility.  We expect you to be honest, we expect you to be crediable.  What that one sentence said to us (well that and the haste on shurikens) is this guy doesnt have a clue.  And thats dangerouse when your in the customer service apparatus.<P>Thanks for reading!<BR>      <P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Dear Alan,<P>Just to make a point to the whole balance issue strictly from a pure melee aspect (pure melees being Warriors, Rogues and Monks):  Rogues get the innate double backstab and warriors get innate stun to their kick at 55 and triple attack.  All of these aren't disciplines.  <P>Monks only receive disciplines in the post50 game.  <P>I would appreciate the tuning team looking into monks getting some form of innate ability that is not a discipline.  There are plenty of great suggestions out there (making thunderkick not a discipline but just a normal skill attack or uncoupling kick and punches come to mind)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My final wishes in the interest of simple coding and implementation.<P>I simply wish:<P>1) Fix FD... There are enough posts here that would agree it needs some work.  That %80 percent chance of a mob knowing you stood back up after they have walked half way across a zone is both stupid and unfair.  It should be either lvl and skill based.<P>2) Increase dmg.  I agree with all those who have stated that it is simply our bodies that should do more dmg... How easy would it be to increase the hand-to-hand cap?  and give the kicks a min.  As someone posted here, nothing like do a super duper flying kick for 1hp.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am at work so have not had time to read all of the Monk talk posts so please forgive me if I am repeating someone's post. I wanted to get this posted before it was too late for me to post anything in this thread.<P>Sneak:<BR>I understand the EQ monk to be similar to a ninja type fighter.  With that in mind, I figure a monk would be more adept at sneaking than skill max of 113. A monk should be pretty adept at sneaking around undetected to get to his victim.<P>New ability (I know, I know, but here it is anyway):<BR>Swift Feet. Allows the monk a short burst of running speed.<P>Available for learning at, say, level 10.<P>Amount of increase is a variable amount (sliding value?) based upon skill where, for example, skill lvl of 125 is equal to Sow, 200 is equal to SoScale, and 250 is max speed a PC can achieve in game.<P>Duration is also a variable amount based upon skill. Something like skill 10 to 40 is 10 seconds, and adding 2 seconds every 10 skill points there after. At max skill of 250 that would be flat out max run for about 52 seconds.<P>Reuse would need to take some time. Maybe 15 minutes up to skill 100 then 13 minutes to 200, then 11 minutes to 249 and finally 10 minutes at 250 skill.<P>Obviously, if skill check fails you don't get the burst.<P>Drawback would be a penalty similar to what the cleric gets when they use Divine Aura.<P>-------------<BR>I love playing a monk BTW.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There have been many good suggestions, and some 'differant' ones. I read a post by chaos(?) in the part two thread that had lots of good ideas. Where as a class monks would have lvl minimums on the special attk's for damage.<P>Where using a type of meditation ability, that would help to cure posion/decease, since a monk should be able to control body with mind. This of course could be a trance like state while this is happening, where the monk has focused the mind and become oblivious to the world around, like when casters get the book during meditate. This state would also let them heal HP's faster, say 2 - 3x's faster then just sitting.<P>Armour was also an issue, where it seems that there are good items out there, but that they are not in a logical order of progression. Plus monks should be able to perhaps use tailoring and other skills to perhaps make better armour, maybe something not as great as the epic stuff, but light weight and character make-able. Course it would be nice to see monks better able to control or limit the damage they do take, like when a boxer enters the ring, after the first few hits to a spot, the effect is lessened as the area becomes stronger over time.<P>Critical Hits, I have posted this idea before. A monk as a master of melee, should be able to size up opponents and strike a nerve, perhaps causing a slowing effect, either to movement or attack, or perhaps breaking a casters concentration for a few rounds. Like a stun perhaps. Since a blow to the head causes most people to see stars.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Then there is the idea of agility, like with throwing a weapon. It might not hit for a critical as some have suggested, but why not let it have a chance to stun? A caster trying to recite a long verbal spell might loose his trend of thought to have a sharp object smack him in the head.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Then there is speed, running the ever so slow CR. Hopeing that the combat and bind spot are not too far apart, lest thee return to find thy comrades either dead, or rejoicing. A monk should be able to channel short bursts of speed, maybe this ability could improve with level. It would possibly never be faster or equal to SOW, but as suggested it would make the job easier for pulling.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/confused.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor. These talks are a Godsend. You are actively taking the players opinions, and presenting them at the tuning meeting.<BR>I put myself in your shoes. You played a Cleric, and thus wouldn't know about Monkly issues, or what is important to us, but there were a few things that jumped out at me during the Monk talks.<P>/**********************************<P>The Epic Quest.<BR>--------------------------------<P>Background.<P>The epic quest actually starts at level 1 with the Headbands and Sashes. The Headbands and Sashes are used for the Robe of the Lost circle quest. You turn them in with drops from drops from Raster of Guk and Targin of SolsekB to Brothers Zephyl and Qwinn. They give you items that you place with shadowsilk and JWW to tailor the Robe (no skill check). You then get the Zan and Fi pipes from Karnors and Chardok, and hand them into Brother Balatin in The Dreadlands for the Robe of the Whilstling Fists. You hand in the Robe of the Whistling Fists during the actual Epic quest for the Celestial Fists.<P>Problem.<P>The Robe of the Lost circle quest takes an incredibly long amount of time. Why? Because you can camp Raster of Guk for hundreds of hours and never see him. Just trust me on this one. I know it sounds crazy, but it is true. This is not necessarily a difficult quest because of the skill required to perform it, but because it takes such an incredibly long time to complete due to the No-Show of Raster. <P>So instead of camping Raster for so long, people decide to take matters into their own hands and slay a member of the Lost Circle and take is robe. Most notably Brother Zephyl. Killing Brother Zephyl is a Dragonraid style encounter. He requires more skill to take down than it takes to kill Minotars in Lower Guk.<P>Some people view this as a cheat, but the original quest designers obviously meant for the Robe of the Lost Circle to drop from Brother Zephyl in the first place otherwise they wouldn't have itemized him that way.<P>Solution.<P>Do not change the drop from Zephyl and Qwinn. The skill required to take down Zephyl is exponentially greater than the skill it takes to sit in Guk for hundreds of hours killing Greens. If anything, buff them up a little more. Increase the spawn time on Raster of Guk for people who want to quest it.<P>Problem.<P>People see a level 30 with Celestial Fists and say "BURN THE WITCH!". This is indeed a problem, but their proposed solution is to remove the multi-questing capabilites for all aspects of the Monk Epic Quest (ie. Robe of the Lost Circle, Robe of the Whistling Fists, and Celestial Fists) is not good. Multi-questing is a great facet of Everquest. It allows people to work together to perform "Epic quests". <P>Solution.<P>Twinking with the Celestial Fists is bad, and is accomplished by multiquesting. Instead of thwarting twinks by removing the multiquesting capabilities, just make it so you can't recieve the Celestial Fists or Wear them Pre-50. You can't even get the text if you are below level 50, so it makes sense not to be <P>given them Pre-50.<P>Total Solution.<P>Twinking with the Robe of the Lost Circle, the Robe of the Whistling Fists, and the Celestial Fists is a very bad thing. But removing the multiquesting capabilites will hurt more monks than the twinking ever would. I would rather see 10 twinks and 1 deserving Monk, than see no twinks and the deserving Monk go without. Leave it as is.<P>/**********************************<P>Damage!<P>Problem.<P>We are trumped out by Rogues and the margin between Monk and Warrior damage in diminishing. My maxiumum flying kick at level 60 is lower than the Rogues MINIMUM backstab. I am not asking for a Rogue nerf, but I am saying that Monk damage needs some serious work.<P>Our Celesital Fists are 9/16 weapons. These are REALLY NICE. <P>Now compare these to a Rogue weidling an EXQUISITE VELIUM SPEAR (12/20 Main and Offhand Piercing) and a Ragebringer (15/25 Primary Hand and Offhand Piercer). <P>They will do 1071 damage per second, without a haste item, or the Ragebringer haste effect, from the front of the MoB. <P>Monks will do 1042 Damage per second without a haste item, or the Celesital Fists haste effect, from the front of the MoB. When you add Flying Kick into the equation, we actually catch up.<P>Now put the Rogue behind the MoB with a Ragebringer in the mainhand, and you get regular double backstabs for 200+. This puts the Rogue at a conservative esimate of 175% of the Monks damage from the back. Now, that makes some sense, but it really hurts when they also do 100% of a Monks damage from the front.<P>Do the same experiment with Warriors, but replace the Ragebringer with an Epic blade, and Warriors will do 98-100% of a Monks damage while tanking 165% better than a Monk.<P>Solution.<P>Rogues and Warriors do the same damage as a Monk. Monks need an edge, Rogues and Warriors do not need a Nerf. We need to be placed in between Backstabbing Rogues and Warriors. I suggest that we be given Tripple Attack at level 51 and have it cap at 200 at level 60. I also suggest a Minimum damage on Flying Kicks (I kick for 3 pts of damage at level 60), along with Criticals on FLying Kicks starting at level 45. This would put is nicely between Warriors and Rogues and damage dealers without overpowering us.<P>/**********************************<P>STOP CASTING A_ORC_ORACLE_00! <P>Problem.<P>We can't stop casters from casting. When we say we want stuns, we don't want to immobilize the MoB, we want to interrupt casting. There is nothing more irritating than us Flying Kicking a level 11 orc and him standing there healing himself laughing. <P>Solution.<P>Please add a *SLIGHT* knockback effect to our Flying Kick or a 0.1 second stun, just so we can interrupt casting. We are not asking to immobilize the MoB for any amount of time, we just get irritated when we can't interrupt casting.<P>Quote of Absor: Actually, my thought was that at, say, 50th level, one of the skills you gain at 5th might get a new bonus, like stun or something. Same damage level, making it only really useful for it's special power. A way to give a monk a special skill without linking it to a higher level skill (making that skill too powerful), and giving it the limitation of much reduced damage. <P>I like that idea.<P>Quote of Absor: Fair enough. And maybe not with all of the attacks. Perhaps all past a certain level, or all kicks… something like that. A good idea, though, and easier to suggest than a stun. <P>I like that idea as well.<P>/**********************************<P>GO AWAY! I'M DEAD!<P>Problem. <P>Feign Death. A couple of issues. Feign Death is our bread and butter. As you can see from my previous statements, we don't do the damage we are supposed to. We rely on Feign Death pulling. As much as you folks may not like it, we need it and use it every day. It makes us viable. With the release of Kunark, Feign Death lost a little bit of its usefulness with the crazy pathing and MoB behavior towards <P>Feign Death. With the release of Velious, Feign Death pulling was essentially eliminated because all the MoBs just walk away at once. Also, Feign Death as an "Evade" is useless in a group or when you or <P>the MoB are below 2 bubbles of heath (ie. when we need it most). It simply doesn't work. It is seen throught 70ish% of the time, without a "Fallen to the ground message".<P>Also, I have a problem with spells and Feign Death. As it stands now, if we are DoTed or casted on while Feigning Death, the MoBs see through it, even if the spell is resisted. Not good.<P>Solution.<P>If we Feign and a MoB casts a spell on us, and it lands, make them see through Feign Death. If we Feign and the MoB casts a spell on us and the spell is resisted, make Feign Death stay. If we Feign and we are already DoTed, make Feign death stay. Our bodies would still be diseased or poisoned even while dead, so the MoBs would beleive it. It makes RP sense.<P>Fix the pathing in Kunark and Velious, please change the MoB behavior so Feign Death pulling or at least Chain pulling stays viable.<P><BR>/**********************************<P>That is all I pretty much have to say. Oh yeah, I almost forgot. "Throwing Criticals" is silly.<P>Thank you very much.<P>I compiled the data using Coplands Weapon Analyzer and the Absor quotes from Castersrealm.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I agree whole-heartedly with the thread made by Bodi.<P>There is one more point that no one has made in any of these posts, that I feel needs to be addressed.  There was a Robe put in the game at the beginning of Kunark, it is called the Robe of the Living Fungus.<P>This Robe is a good robe for druids and clerics, and an excellent robe for monks.  Or it was. The stats are 10ac, +4wis, +12sta, and 10vs fire.  It drops from the Myconoid Spore King (I believe, I bought my robe) , the same mob that drops the Fungi Tunic.<P>This Robe is a -very- difficult robe to get, requiring forces that are at least 55+ in level.  It used to have the effect: Fungal Regrowth, but it got a stealth nerf.<P>This nerf was NOT announced in a patch message.  This nerf turned one of the best monk robes in the game into something that no monk will wear after they obtain a Sythrak Hide Jerkin or better.  <P>Solution:  Because the Robe does not have great AC, and is pretty much Monk Only, and is a rare drop from a level 55+ mob...it only makes sense that the effect be restored to the robe, or at least an effect like Chloroplast or Regeneration.<P>Let's balance out the risk vs. reward shall we?  Besides, I paid an arm and a leg for this robe, only to have it nerfed in the next patch.  That was very un-cool.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Currently I play a lvl 47 iksar monk.  I belive along with Absor that major changes should not be implemented but I do have a few suggestions/requests that I believe should be considered that would help balance the class as a whole.<BR>1)Monks are supposed to do the most offensive damage in the game with the exception of rogues backstab. I believe monks should get triple attack at say lvl 50.  This would surely ensure that even monks without weapons such as tranquil staffs, or runed fighter staffs, would out damage warriors with their fist or fighting batons.<BR>2)I believe as monks level they should get a fairly ever increasing haste.  Every 10 levels Monks should get a 3-6% haste buff. This would make more monks want to lvl up and would be an ample reward.<BR>3)Feign death is a great skill.  I am extremely happy it is in the game.  I happen to find however that when I really need it to work or when I need to clear a mob aggro I can hit it 5-8x and still the monster is not memory blured.  I think the rate of memory blur per feign should be increased somewhat.<BR>4)I have to say I love the resistant discipline! good one guys  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>5)I find that our flying kick misses quite a bit. If maybe it wouldn't miss as much or maybe if it would hit more often but with lower damage output that would be nice.<BR>6)The 14 weight on monks is extremely hard to meet. An increase as small as 16 or 17 weight allowance would be superb.<BR>7) I know I am getting off on a rant here (dennis miller) but I feel over all the monk class is a great class. If one of the above was implemented I would be happy. I definitely think that if Feign mem blur was improved or if triple attack was introduced or if that haste thing was introduced then that would be awesome.  I apologize Absor for my poor grammar and sentence structure but my mom is in the other room yelling for me to go to bed so I have to kind of hurry.  Have a great time and take these suggestions anyway you want.  Do what is best for the game in your mind.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Night  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ok, this is not anything with balance I suppose, but would certainly add to the coolness factor.  When monk fight hand to hand we make these silly roundhouse punches, very un-martial arts like.  Also, the 2hb attack graphic is extremely lame, but oh well.  ANYWAY, go look at the giants in Kael and how they look when they attack, they do a cool martial arts kinda arm thing, is there anyway monks could get this new animation?<P>Also, I personally dont think our epic is all that great.  9/16?

</FONT><HR>Kunark has imbalanced the entire game. Where classes were balanced the manner in which “Kunark” was implemented was poorly done and simply ruined some major melee classes.<P>This comparison gives you some hard core data on pure melee classes– although some commentary are more based on personal experience, I have played the game since the inception. Some comments are meant to be funny and should be taken as such – there is no intent to flame anyone and when you read it apply the humor where it should be applied.<P>Defense Pre-expansion<P>Monk Warrior Rogue<P>230 200 200<P>Expansion<P>252 252 252<P>Increase in skill power.<P>9.6% 26% 26%<P>Compensation <P>Monk - No new armor. Warrior -New insane Ac armor WITH SPELLS. Rogue new uber chain armor with spells.<P>Evaluation: Substantial decrease in the defense power of the monk without ANY compensation compared to other pure melee classes.<P>What should have happened? A significant increase of the Monk’s Hit points to increase tanking/defense ability. If the regular skills did not go up, the AC, HP, new defense skill or a combination of all three should have taken place.<P><BR>Offense Pre-expansion<P>Monk Warrior Rogue<P>230 200 210<P>Expansion<P>252 252 252<P>Increase in skill power.<P>9.6% 26% 20%<P><BR>Monk and Warrior (high level) duel wield items of the same exact type. Thus, basically producing a warrior with monk like damage with incredible Hit points and AC. Enter the Warrior “God class” of melee. The Rogue getting new weapons and skills having incredible damage output with virtually no penalty. The rogue can solo on guild events and receive zero damage and still get the kill versus multiple groups of 6. <BR>Expansion - Monks were introduced with high damage “two handed weapons”. There is a reason warriors use duel wielding weapons over “two handed weapons”. (Paladins do about 25% of the damage of a well-equipped duel-wielding warrior). It’s pretty incredulous to place a 2 handed weapon on a class that has always had the premier signature duel wield attack. What were even more unthinkable were monk only weapons that weighed more than steel two-handed weapons.<P>Background – Monks were the “King of Offense” they paid the price with low ac items, low hit points, and a significant weight restriction but were balanced with much higher defense skills to compensate. Post expansion destroyed the balance.<P>Monk weapon/offense skills<P>1st number pre-expansion skill caps. 2nd number post expansion skill caps. 3rd number percentage increase.<P>HTH <BR>240,252, 5%<P>1HB<BR>240, 252, 5%<P>2HB<BR>240,252, 5%<P>Kick<BR>200,250,25% (never used)<P>Tiger Claw<BR>200,225,12.5% (never used)<P>Eagle Strike (Hardly ever used)<BR>200,225,12.5%<P>Dragon punch (Hardly ever used)<BR>200,225,12.5%<P>Flying Kick (Signature special attack)<BR>200,225,12.5% Still trying to understand why our signature attack was only increased to 225 instead they raise kick to 250.

I’m having a very hard time with this one. While warriors are now doing monk like damage with none of the disadvantages they now exceed monks in damage. The only words that come to my mind – Drug Free Work Place saves you money on your Worker’s Compensation.

After the expansion, not only did they exceed monks damage ability “one” rogue could easily out damage a full group with a couple of monks being in the group. Although the damage a Rogue can do can’t be seen via this evaluation, the “skill” of back stab is almost to the point of being unbalancing. (NO, don’t “nerf” the ability just adjust the other classes.)<P>Monk defense skills<P>Dodge<BR>200,230,15%<P>Block<BR>200,230,15%<P>Disarm<BR>200,200,0% (The most useless skill in the entire game)<P>Riposte<BR>200,225,12.5%<P><BR>Warrior defense skills<P>Dodge<BR>140,175,12.5%<P>Parry<BR>200,230,15%<P>Disarm<BR>200,200,0% (The most useless skill in the entire game)<P>Riposte<BR>200,225,12.5%<P>Rogue<P>Dodge<BR>150,210,40%<P>Parry<BR>200,230,15%<P>Disarm<BR>200,200,0% (The most useless skill in the entire game)<P>Riposte<BR>200,225,12.5%<P>Evade<BR>I don’t have the percentages on this skill. However, it allows the Rogue to do unlimited amounts of damage without ever worrying about the “hate list”. Poor rangers begged for something like this but got a horrible spell version versus a Rogue’s simple click.<BR>Click!! Hear that? That’s the Ranger hitting the ground dead.<P><BR>Melee classes that need to be fixed is: Monk, Paladin, SK and Ranger. Even though I did not go into the hybrid versus parent fight, these classes need some significant improvements. Paladins and SK must get a significant improvement on the damage dealing side. Rangers need evade or “gasp” a little more defenses. It’s good to have a “Vision” and to make a class offensive and defensive but you have a bad tendency of over applying your “Vision” by giving double, triple and quadruple penalties.<P>Ridge DeForce<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One of the largest reasons monks are unhappy with the state of our class is because Verant forced the issue of what role we serve in the game upon us.<P>Before the string of skill and mob nerfs, our role was pulling.  Verant didnt like this, so now come velious, FD pulling is all but dead...as is the skill as well since everything seems to see through it.<P>Without our primary role anymore, you've made us realize just how pitiful we are compared to warriors and rogues (Warriors take more dmg, rogues do more dmg...so why would anyone want the middle of the road monk? Because the rogue and warrior are on a bio break?)<P>I think you could solve the whole balance issue by making FD pulling a viable skill again.<P>Monks HAD a role in Everquest...I think it needs to be given back.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>i've been trying to have a look at most of the class threads as i feel it'll give me a better understanding of what the different classes and their concerns.<P>i haven't got a very high lvl monk so i can say from first hand experience what they really need. but i can understand from playing my other characters and seeing what goes on and it gives me a rough idea.<P>FD needs to be upgraded for post lvl 50 monks at least. having to /quit out of the game or FDing many many times is a joke. if the creature thinks your dead and then goes away then it should be a total whipe from the hate list right then and there. nothing worse than having an area constantly trained with mobs due to a monk FDing every minute or so as he/she tries to get off the hate list.<BR>if FD says it succeeds then it needs to succeed, not give you the success message and still have the creatures beat the crap out of you.<P>the monks damage output does need to be increase somewhat to be more in line with the current weapons available in Norrath for other classes.<BR>monks are being left behind as more and more  uber weapons are being introduced into the EQ world.<P>just as a small WARNING though to monks in general about the future changes in ranks for the melee classes. <P>the rogue thread is very very heated at the moment about the almost guaranteed nerf they're going to make to Evade.<BR>seems Absor has been ill informed about the way evade works.<P>i have so far been very suprised to see that most monks don't have class envy and deem rogues to be too uber at all.<BR>we require special conditions to be the damage dealers that we are now and we don't really have much of a role appart from that.<P>this is all about to change though and monks will leap up to being better damage dealers than even rogues.<P>in Absor's thinking you can hit evade and it'll put you at the bottom of the hate list and can even make the creature run off and attack someone that's somewhere else in the zone. this is so wrong it's laughable. <P>i freaked out when i did see this posted and i'll explain why:<P>**Evade<BR>I don’t have the percentages on this skill. However, it allows the Rogue to do unlimited amounts of damage without ever worrying about the “hate list”. Poor rangers begged for something like this but got a horrible spell version versus a Rogue’s simple click.**<P>not a simple click. like using FD you have multiple times in combat where you evade and come up with a success message yet have no change on the creature status at all. many rogues are screaming out to Absor that evade doesn't work all the time when it does show success and it's very easy to get fails besides that. this shows that evade obviously doesn't put you on the bottom of the hate list at all. evade has a 10 second refresh time on it so a pre-nerfed evade can fail or succeed with no result many many times before you could actually get an actual success off. <BR>with the new nerfed evade this will mean we will remain so close to no. 1 on the hate list that we'll die faster than a ranger trying to tank V'ghera .<BR>.....................<P>i know that this isn't a rogue thread or somewhere to whine about rogue issues. but it'll give perhaps some indication as to the changes in ranks for monks as regards to being higher on the damage dealing ladder.<P>i seriously hope they improve monk damage output and i hope they upgrade FD at least for lvl 50+ characters. you're going to need it being the new leaders in melee damage power.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Feign Death needs to be fixed.  If I don't get a failure message, why does the mob keep beating on me?  What other skill, when you SUCCEED at performing it, has about a 10% chance to work??<P>Monk damage needs to be increased. With new weaponry available to the other classes, and our "epic" weapon -- 2 delay faster and same damage as a cheap Jade Mace from a level 45-ish zone -- monk damage has fallen FAR behind its old position...  Give us back our role of best toe-to-toe melee -- it's all we can do for a group!<P>If you need more reasons why, see Zadkiel/Bodi's post. It really does cover the whole issue.<P>Also -- Warriors get stunning kicks at 55, and triple attack at 60.  Rogues get double-backstab at 55, and Assasinate (not a Disciple, like our 72 minute recycle POS, but an INNATE SKILL) at 60.  Monks get +1HP regen while feigned, and four pounds off our weight penalty at 55, and the same thing again at 60.  Come on...  Monks need SOMETHING at 55 and 60 that can help the COMBAT BALANCE.<P>------------<P>Finally:  Why is it that our epic loses all of it's non-haste benefits when you get buffed?  A Ragebringer (don't nerf rogues) has the same haste, the same AC bonus, and the same ATK bonus. However, THEIR AC and ATK bonuses will stack WITH EVERY SINGLE BUFF IN THE GAME, even if they have a BETTER item-haste available.  Ours will stack with...  oh, cleric buffs.  And that's about it.  (for a more complete list of stacking issues, see Zad/Bodi's post).  Just alter the AC and ATK bonuses so they actually STACK -- no matter what -- just like a Ragebringer.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Druids don't get crap but they're everywhere.  Why?  Because they're fun to play.  Most people play this game to have fun.  Not to show everyone what they have.<P>You can easily balance monks just like you can balance all other classes in one shot.  Quit introducting mega-items.  And get rid of inspect. The class should be the best item you can get.  Sure you can get knuckledusters, but it won't be much better than what you already have as a natural attribute to your class/race.  This will cure the "look at me" crowd and the "i just wanna play a few hours a week" crowd  <P>I see all these 50+ people writing in.  Who cares about them, I mean really.  How much revenue for verrant do you guys/gals actually account for?  The 30ish on down crowd is who pays the bills.  Vox raid?  LOL Many of the people paying to play this game have no idea who she is, or what she is.  Or if it's even a she.  Just make it fun and quit worrying about all this "balance" crap.  It doesn't even matter what race you are anymore, you can twink your character to be just like everyone else so the race advantage was taken away for the sake of "balance"  Don't you guys know what happens when you try to make everything so fair?

But I think the game will be more fun adding High level COMMON gear throught all levels. The idea is to add more content not remove some. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Fnord.<P>How bout when you make a new monk, it comes equiped at level 1 with a KD, fungi tunic, fbss and a SoS?<P>Bah.  You see, the nice things about monks was that before weapons, monks were reasonably untwinkable and kept the Doods, trolls, and kiddiez out of the class.<P>Anyway.<P>Absor:<BR>Have ID grey out others ONLY if it doent interfere with the way it works now.  Currently, we can use timing and such, and our special attack overrides out ID, which can be important.<P>CFs can be overwritten by anyone.  Including the passing charicter who just dosnt like you and wishes to interfere with your play style.  Make the CFs overwrite so the monks can have control and not be at the whim of a passing enchanter  "I dont like to see monks soloing so this will mess you up".<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055101-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055101.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055101-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055101-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055101-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055101-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055101&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055101&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
