</FONT><HR>! Do not remove the FADE spell series from revision.<BR>- At present, it is not used because of Z-axis bugs and lack effectiveness in combat.<BR>- If it is class defining, why leave it broken?<BR>- If revised, it can lend itself to Verant's redefinition of Wizards as "Masters of Defense."<P>"The Wizard is a seeker of knowledge, and her life is spent focusing on this goal. She uses powerful spells to see things from afar and transport them between places. A thirst for arcane knowledge has made her a master of defense, as well as an offensive force of destruction." ("Everquest: The Ruins of Kunark," pg. 26, SCEA 2000)<P>+ Revamp the class defining FADE spell series<BR>- Add CONCUSSION-like hate list reducer effect to entire series.<BR>- Add higher level spells to series after YONDER adding INVISIBILITY and/or AOE MEMORY BLUR.<BR>- This would support the "Masters of Defense" redefinition.<P>+ Revamp CONCUSSION to follow the FADE series<BR>- Change the level to 51, to appropriately reflect the challenge of the quest<BR>- Change the Effect to: Target SHADOW STEP, Target MEMORY BLUR<P>Fade is used for Defense.  Those that complain about its randomness in combat, think, would you rather shadow step out of danger to the other side of the room, than tank an aggro mob and die for sure?<P>If the FADE series lowers mob hate (exactly what concussion does), which would make sense (Mob: "ME BASHUM GOOD... er, WHERE HE GO... ME KILL YOU INSTEAD!"), then this spell would be used throughout its progression, and the Brain Bite quest would not have to be changed.<P>As the series progresses toward CONCUSSION, it can include a MEMORY BLUR or MESMERIZE element, again fully in line with the "Masters of Defense" title that is specific to the Wizard class.<P>THE BEST DEFENSE IS NOT TO FIGHT AT ALL.<P>The bonus effect makes it worth the risk of the quest, and to reflect the change to the spell, raise the level of Concussion to 49 or 51.  Think of it as the "There is no spoon" defense.  "These aren't the wizards you're looking for. Move along."<P>Esperifiel Solice<BR>Follower of Solusek Ro and the Path of Fire</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just a simple spell idea for lower lvl Wizards.<BR>We get Teleport(TP) spell then Portal spells at higher lvls.<BR>We get self random inzone TP(Fade, Shadow Step, Yonder). Why not add a group version of these spells for those low lvl encounters. Granted this would compound the current problems with this type of spell (ie. virtical movement problems). However, I think it would be a possibly useful and interesting added game element.<P>Good idea?

</FONT><HR>All I have to say is WOW... a bunch of nice stuff being suggested for Wizards which would somewhat benefit all other classes as well.<P>Increased Mana Regen: From a PvP server perspective this will mean more bind-rushing wizards but I can deal with that easily enough. Maybe make it take effect only after level 35 when you get the sit to med thing as it would prevent alot of the lowbie jerks from picking wizard for super mana regen rates.<P>Spell Efficiency: Everyone suffers this, it wasnt nearly as noticable in the old zones or Kunark zones as much as it is in Velious. Spell Efficiency is just too low to deal with the increase in HPs but if you increase the damage spells do you unbalance all the classes again looking at a PvP perspective.<P>Percentage DMG Spells: GREAT Idea, it should have been implimented long ago but sadly I fear its too late for such things to become part of the game. Might be restricted to a wizard only ability.<P>Al'Kabor Line of Spells: Wait till you see how great AOE groups are with these. Take a group of the following. 1 Cleric, 1 Enchanter, 3 Wizards and 1 Monk. Monk pulls a train and FDs, Enchanter begins to chain AOE stun, Wizards cast these spells and the cleric heals as nessessary.<P>Snare for Wizards: Good idea, although if you give them TOO good of a single target snare you'll remove the main reason why any group wants a druid in their group besides to taxi.<P>Shadowstep Line: Way too overpowered in PvP with casters if you make it so it works vertically as well as horizontally then your gonna screw everyone over. Shadowknights could retain this spell in its original form as its a last resort to get away after realizing they're going to die if they stick arround and melee any more.<P>A blink type spell would work by costing about 50-75 mana. Last about 2-5 minutes. Be triggered by melee swings. Suck as much mana each time it goes off as it would have been to cast the original shadowstep spell and WOULD NOT go off if you didnt have enough mana to be sucked out. It would be GROUP ONLY as you couldnt cast it on wandering melee types before you engage them with a pet and have them disoriented as hell and should be able to be clicked off.<P>Concussion: Its listed as a level 39 spell yet by the quest it appears to me that noone short of a level 55+ could complete this quest. Everything you need to get for it is NODROP off high level stuff (50+) and the scroll itself is NODROP. Make the scroll tradeable and maybe it wouldnt be so difficult to obtain.<P>Melee Proof NPCs: I love this idea. Maybe make them do MIN damage of their weapon each round they strike thus they could input some damage and pray for a bunch of procs but these types of monsters would have to be very easily tauntable and have low resists across the board (or if your using it for big encounters toughened areas and sucker punch areas).<P>Critical Spell Hits: Good idea to implement perhaps across the board. A critical spell could do one of many things... Automatic 100% damage regardless of resistance (or movement for DOTs), Does 25% more damage, Lowers resistances for the next 5 minutes, stun target, ect... Wizards could have a 10% chance of this happening, all 'casting' classes could have a 5% chance.<P>Quad Kiting: See my post in the druid thread. Risk vs Reward... Its harder to kite 4 blues than it is for a group of 6 to fight 1 deep red.<P>Supression Spells: Wizards are the planes travelers make them supress gate, Druids should have a spell that supresses summoning.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Would it be terribly unbalanced to give wizards some form of items comparable to melee FBSS's Haste etc that give a percentage of mana regen?  <P>Melee haste items increase the damage or give you extra attacks for the CHANCE to do more damage.<BR>The % bonus on the Gear would give us the CHANCE to do more damage by giving us more mana to try.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>just some random thoughts on spells.<P>Note this is in relation the game before they raised the level cap.<P>Clerics get their ultimate healing spell, complete heal at level 39.<BR>Wizards got their ultimate damage spell at level 49.<P>hmm... Doesnt seem very fair.<P>Complete heal heals 10,000 HP.<BR>Ice commet will do anywhere from 7 to 1120 damage.<P>hmm... now it REALLY doesnt seem fair.<P>Clerics can buy Complete heal at a vender.<BR>Wizards can only get ice commet by research, but the Runes for it are extremely hard to get.<BR>(remember that before kunark you could only get the runes from vox, nagafen, or completing the staff of the wheel quest)<P>Am I the only one who sees this?<BR>--------------------------------------------------<P>Now for an outragious idea.<P>Clerics get complete heal, its a shame wizards dont get a complete kill spell instead of ice commet. The spell would have a 4:1 ratio, for every 4 points of damage done to the mob, 1 point of the wizards mana would be spent. The limit being either until the mob is dead, or all the wizards mana is spent. This spell would be impossible to resist. It would have a casting time of like 10 minutes.<P>It would also help the ubermob problem. I think I have about 2,500 mana, so with one cast of that spell, I would do about 10,000 damage to the ubermob, then I could zone out and med up in safety, knowing that I did my job.<P>Yes, I know this would make it extremely easy for a wizard to solo, but that is EXACTLY the kind of power I expected when I made my character on March 16, 1999(EQ release day). Back then no one knew that the magician was so much more powerful then the wizard.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am very disappointed after reading what Absor has posted for he just ignored the main problems we wizards are facing after reading all our posts.<P>1) Group-friendly: nothing on his list addresses this problem.<P>2) Uniqueness of the wizard class: why are we unique? what makes wizards unique?<P>Below are some of my ideas:<P>1) Grouping with a wizard will get mana bonus.<BR>i.e - lvl of the wizard x 5 x (number of people in group/2) in group. So if there's a lvl 60 wizard in a full group, everyone gets 60 x 5 x 6/2 = 900 extra mana. <P>2) Give us more group spells. i.e - group blink, group endure breath, group elemental shield that boosts fire, cold, magic resist, AoE root, AoE stun. <P>3) Make mana regenerates faster when grouping with a wizard. <P>4) Lower the aggro of our spells so we can chain nuke (so being able to cast faster becomes an advantage not a suicide action). <P>5) Harvest II and III is a good idea. <P>6) You know that the "Sight-line" spells are useless because of the clipping plane why not give us something new? <P>7) The Al'Kabor line spells need to be looked at. <P>8) Our root should last longer because we rely on our DDs and root most of the time. <P>9) Faster mana regenerate rate|less mana to cast|spells do more damage. <P>10) More gates/portals would be nice. <P>11) New skill/principle - Concentration - when use, mana regenerates faster, fewer fizzles, increase AC, Mana, decrease HP, AGI, DEX, STR. Spells do more damage and consume less mana. Make it last 3 - 5 mins and recast time 1hr or so. <BR>I am only a lvl 38 wizard so I don't know what problems the higher lvls are having but the above are some of my ideas. Verant should address/be aware of 4 main issues that we are having which are <P>1) Wizards are not group-friendly. <P>2) Long down time and when we run out of mana we don't contribute to our group no more while pet-classes can still have their pets beat on the mob. <P>3) Warriors can't fight without HP but clerics can complete heal. We can't fight without mana, but no classes in EQ have the ability to give others full mana in several seconds. <P>4) What makes Wizard Unique? Mage has pets, damage shields, summon ability, DDs, AoEs. We get damage shields too but why? Seems we get all our spells from the Mage class? They have everything we have save ports. So please address "uniqueness". <P>Just my 2 cents <P>Cirea, lvl 42 Wizard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

PLEASE DO NOT GIVE MANA REGEN TO OTHER CASTER CLASSES AS A FIX FOR US.  That will solve nothing.  We give up everything to be the top caster class please let the mana regen be an innate wizard abilty.  Not a mage, necro, druid, or shaman ability.

</FONT><HR>Well i must say i am very pleased with this list.<BR>Thank You for all your endless reading (i know i did hehe)and helping our class.<P>though i have some last minute suggestions.<P>increase mana regen. cant you just up the meditate skill? capp it at 400?<P>second bad tp places. maybe in case of CT make it so the lizards will not come in aggro range of you when you dircetly zone in, thus giving you a chance to invis. and in cases like WK set the "safe spot" close to Qeynos Hills zone. so we have at least some way to get there faster. insted of being even more closer to the NK zone line.<P>the kunark TP spells are exaclty the same for both wiz's and druids with the exception that Skyfire location is extremely dangerous. very much more so then the druids one. i dont think this is right.<P>i won't go into to much and go on too long. should of done that early'r.<P>though i wanted you to asks yourself one thing. not only about wiz's but in general. things like "you have to be in a kunark zone to cast evac" dangerous tp spots. roots that always have a chance to break and 25% when getting nuked. never being improved only time gets longer. put a dragon on a Teleport spot (wakening)<BR>honestly...how much more dept does al this give to the game? for me most of these things add to my frustration level and in no way make the EQ world any more realistic or more enjoyable game. it adds to frustration and waisted time. not too more realistic and dept in the game. <P>Ok i'll stop now  =)<BR>just needed to say this. overall i'm very pleased if this list is gonna be implemented<P>Greetings<BR>Bodan Ji'e'Toh<BR>56 Evoker <BR>Xegony<P>*Thank you for Flying Bo Air*<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ok i have a few suggestions on the DD increase mana regen line of spells <P>Give a Wiz the ability to imbue his spell effects into Gems ( make it usable for one charge and make it only 5 spell stackable at that point you cant make any more)<P>You can charge a Gem with Harvest...<BR>or a TP spell or A DD spell <P>they would have a almost instant cast time and you pay the mana caust ahead of time to make them.<P>Here is how i see it working you memorise the Imbue spell the next spell you cast while holding the Gem imbuse it.. <P>Maybe allow us to trade them to other classes <BR>(maybe maybe not)<P>Increase our mana regeneration.<P>Give us a COTH spell line (it was forced into the mage Framework and really doesnt fit there - we need that kind of utility) <P>We need a percentage damage spell for SOV uber mobs..and it MUST have a Brain Bite Effect or we are toast.<P>since our sight line really doesnt work give us a fix.... 2 spell lines ( one that removes all weather effect and lets us see underwater another that give us a list of npc's in zone when not tageting anyone this same spell when targting a mob could give mob info ie what buffs it has its HP and level or quest faction info)????<P>I like the idea of a blink series but it scares me a little being ported around a dungen when you hit a few times ( wizzard ping pong no thank you)<P>I would like a offensive version of blink where its a limmited duration shield that when a mob hits the shield it is youndered away from us and stuned/dissoriented for 3 secs <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Please add this to your list.”&lt;<P>Really?  Odd.  I would think if this was a problem it would be a problem for all classes with those spells.  And, as far as I can remember, you’re the only person to mention this in any of these threads.  Does anyone else have this problem?<P>rob63 wrote:<P>&gt;”Please also fix the fizzle rate on Sheild of Magi--it is about as ridiculous as Atols!”&lt;<P>Ok.<P>NeuroS-TDE wrote:<P>&gt;”2)*ADD* the evac to skyfire is a DEATHTRAP.. pls move our evac location to where the druid circle is in skyshrine”&lt;<P>I thought it was on the list...  but it seems it’s not.  I’ll add it.  But it’s not likely to be moved to any druid circle, if it’s moved at all.<P>Targonis-FW wrote:<P>&gt;”Nice that my idea for disciplines for casters, as well as buffs that take care of many issues across all caster classes were not mentioned. Seems Absor either missed them, or just doesn't understand the caster vs. melee issue in general.”&lt;<P>Or maybe he understood them just fine, but thought that creating a ton of new disciplines and buffs was a lot more than is needed to fix things.  There are better ways.  And such a long list of things (if I’m remembering them correctly) would take a lot of time and balancing.<P>Grimstaff wrote:<P>Ok, you’ve got a long list.  Some of it I did cover, though.  And I’m not gonna argue with you again about rains...<P>&gt;”-Staff of Temperate Flux doesn't do enough resistance reduction to have any function other than pulling and aggro. In order to have real effect, it needs to have the minimum resistance reduction Verant recognized would be useful in the game (Tashan does 15 points of reduction).”&lt;<P>One item, not really a big deal, I would think.  And maybe it was never intended to be as good as Tashan...<P>&gt;”-Fade, Shadowstep, Yonder don't port past objects like buildings and trees. Even if the not porting UP part is addressed, this still cripples the line by making it even less effective than its randomness already is in any but wide open spaces. That needs to be addressed as well. “&lt;<P>I imagine that the reason that these things don’t go through buildings and such would be the same reason that they won’t go over hills.<P>&gt;”-As has been mentioned earlier by others, EFFICIENCY of blasts was not addressed directly (although you sort of covered it in the damage scaling issues). This would go a long ways toward fixing the mana and damage scaling issues. “&lt;<P>Actually, I think I did address this directly.<P>ITEM:  Spell efficiency.<P>&gt;”-Something not mentioned about damage was speed. Having a blast cast slower than gate is a bit much, and while this was addressed by the Draught line post 50, there isn't anything before level 50. Further, there are spells for other classes (Druid level 44 Calefaction and Magician level 54 Scars of Sigil) that cast MUCH faster - the Druid one before level 50. Wizards are said to be masters of fast damage right? Shouldn't they have some line like this through their levels?”&lt;<P>Maybe.  But it’s not really unbalanced as it is.  The fact that there are a few spells that cast fast really can’t be considered unbalancing.  And this is also sort of covered in the Spell Efficiency thing.  Doing a lot of damage in 6 seconds is still faster than doing less damage in 4 seconds...<P>&gt;”-AE Rain spells must hit more waves than they do, and while I showed you why they should hit with all 3 waves on all 4 targets before, here's the basic argument:<BR>---AE Rain spells take 12 seconds to take effect and as such are a sort of DOT. DOT spells have higher efficiency than DD spells because of this time effect, even fast ones.<BR>---AE Rain spells can be resisted in three separate packets, which makes them uniquely vulnerable to resistances (which, as you mentioned, appear to be higher than normal). This is another argument for higher efficiency, to compensate for this weakness<BR>---AE spells in general are more efficient than DD spells when you count all the targets they hit (see PBAE spells for example) but this is misleading. Each of those targets only suffered a small amount of that total damage, and aren't dead, but aggroed greatly on the caster now en masse. This is another limitation that argues for higher efficiency.<BR>---AE Rain spells, unlike a normal DOT (with higher resistance), can be physically left, the area they are hitting can be walked away from, which prevents the rest of the damage being suffered. This is an ADDITIONAL drawback that calls for greater efficiency. “&lt;<P>I know, I know...<P>&gt;”-The post 34 alleged reduction in resistances Wizards are supposed to have innately was not mentioned. This does not appear to have notable if ANY effect in the game, and if it is supposed to be there could bear some examination.”&lt;<P>Never heard of this.  I don’t even remember it being mentioned in the threads, or ever in all of my time with EverQuest, as a player or tester or employee.  Are you sure this isn’t one of those famous EQ myths?  I’ll add it to the list.  I at least want to find out about it.<P>&gt;”-The Peridot costs too much for the minor upgrade in protection Diamondskin gives, but I'm hoping the examination that Rune IV and the Cleric Symbol gets will cover this as well.”&lt;<P>It might.  I’ll try to make sure that we look at all spells that cost a peridot.  But I’m thinking that there’s a reason these spells cost so much.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>&gt;”-Nothing was mentioned about removing the aggro on Eye of Zomm (which would make it function as a scouting tool, as it was intended to be).”&lt;<P>Nope, no mention was made.  I just happen to know that it IS intended to work as it does.  It’s not supposed to allow you to scout into dangerous places, that’s why it aggros things.<P>&gt;”-Fizzles post 50, this was covered in several other threads, so this is not a major issue. “&lt;<P>Mention specific spells if you’ve got them. <P>&gt;”-Eanamin reminded me of this: The Z axis on Bonds of force wasn't addressed, could you look into that? There is a real problem with it. “&lt;<P>Ok.  Is it only with Bonds?  He basically stated that it was ALL rain and snare spells, and that didn’t sound right.  I’ll add it to my notes on Bonds.<P>&gt;”-Kyria brought up the problem with post-50 damage that has confused me since Kunark came out. Why does a Wizard's spell damage go down blast per blast? Isn't the class supposed to be about fast damage? Draught and Lure spells should have been in place at lower levels anyway. “&lt;<P>For less resistance, you get less efficiency.  That’s how it works, and it makes sense.  You don’t really need those spells at lower levels, do you?  You get them when the resistances get high.<P>&gt;”-Zankoku had some good things to say, especially about Lure spells. In order to land a spell, our alleged specialty, we have to take a huge cut in total damage and mana efficiency. Why should this be true? I can see special low efficiency lure spells before level 50 but after shouldn't all blasts have more of a lure-like effect?”&lt;<P>Because the can affect the target more easily, they are more efficient than other spells that will be more resisted (or always resisted).<P>&gt;”-Ghoul Arch Magus brought up overall AE spells in context of damage types. While I see this as an issue, I further would say that the efficiency and types are scattered so poorly that it is difficult to have any sort of consistent AE activity with your character. Growing up as a player you get used to and comfortable with strategies and tactics that work well, dying has such a penalty that new things are met with grave distrust and skepticism. We have but a few hot spots of AE effectiveness through the levels but overall it is very inconsistent and poorly designed. Fixing Al'Kabor is a great step, but it is always going to be a specialty AE, every level that has only Al'Kabor spells really should have another option as well.“&lt;<P>Well, I disagree.  I like the idea that players need to find new ways to do things, that they have to learn to use new spells every on occasion.  I guess that using the argument that it’s hard and dangerous to have to learn how to use spells because they aren’t consistently available isn’t a very strong one.<P>&gt;”-Random notes: Enstill's minimum duration should be shared by Immobilize, and ONLY be like mes, if they aren't harmed by anyone. Paralyzing Earth being an AE root spell makes sense, it really isn't that much of an upgrade, and with the unreliability of root, this would not be especially overpowering (particularly if you could root yourself). Oldrak brought up a great point about resists and perception, why does a Moss Snake know as well as Vox that my Ice Blast did only 7 of its 450 total possible damage? Shouldn't there be SOME level of perception involved, instead of total aggro on you based on what it could have done? Aggro really needs to be re-examined in the game overall at any rate.”&lt;<P>Aggro is a whole ‘nother ball of wax.  But the things that you describe are fairly embedded into the system...<P>&gt;”Think of it this way guys: Give a little to gain a lot. If we are nerfed some, the pain we feel will be something other classes look at and go "well, yeah they got lots of stuff but they had to give a little just like us" and that is useful for Verant and us both.“&lt;<P>It doesn’t really work like that.  This isn’t a bargaining thing here.  It’s a balance thing.  IF invis to undead goes away, there will not be some sort of requirement to add something else.  IF it’s removed (and I’ll admit that it’s unlikely) it will be for balance reasons, not just so that we can add something else.<P>&gt;”Regarding single target/AE snare: Absor, don't put your own thoughts into our list, did ANYONE ask for that? Leave that one out.”&lt;<P>Sorry, no.  Again, this is about balance and all that.  IF it is determined that this is not unbalancing, then it won’t be touched.  But, well, I get to have my say too.  This is not just about gathering wish list items, it’s about balance.  Again, just like the invis to undead thing, it’s not likely to change.  But it does warrant looking at.<P>Sunstrike wrote:<P>&gt;”I can see now that there will not be any major change to Wizards. Absor have missed a great deal of our concerns.”&lt;<P>I’d love to hear which ones I missed.  I think I got them all.<P>&gt;”These class threads was meant to be handeling balance issues between the classes. The only thing I see in Absors post is that the balance of Mages versus Wizards. This shouldnt be the main issue. We need Verant to look into the Melee vs Caster damage issue, especially for Wizards as this is our only contribution in a group. <BR>Hope that you add this to your list.”&lt;<P>Already on the list.  Look at some of the individual items.  No, I didn’t write: ITEM:  Make wizards do as much damage as warriors over the long fight.  Instead I listed way to fix this as individual items.  That just seemed more useful.<P>Anyhow.  The one thing I seem to have missed is any real method of making wizards more group friendly.  But it seems that most of the ideas I’ve seen to do that are pretty... out of whack.  Personally, I think that if we find a way to make wizards a little more efficient with their ability to blow stuff up, then they will immediately become wanted.  I don’t agree that you have to have ‘group’ spells to be useful in a group.  But if you folks can come up with a way to be more group friendly without just taking some other classes group-friendliness spells or something, chime in.  But I have to admit, I didn’t see anything like that in any of the threads.  Evaks and damage are what wizards bring to a group, and I think that should be enough, if it’s all working right.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> Another thing I see was overlooked is the gaze line of spells. If I remember correctly, someone suggested that the caster's 1st person view be moved out away from the caster when casting the gaze line, and Absor liked the idea. This would really help in outdoor scouting, and definately make us more group friendly in outdoor groups.<BR> Also, to my knowledge no one has given Absor the specifics of the "concussion" spell quest, and why it is so hard. So I will make an attempt.<BR> The quest is given out in the OT and Firona Vie by NPC's. They basically give you 3 jars to fill with the souls of dead wizards, in the form of "a human skelaton". One can be found in Trank's teeth along the zone wall, and from what I understand is not KoS to anyone. I don't think anyone has a problem with this part of the quest.<BR> The next is deep in the back of Karnor's Castle and may or may not be KoS, depending on race and religion. Well a level 39 has no business stepping foot in Karnor's Castle, let alone going deep inside for a quest. It would be suicide with 2 full groups of high 30's-low 40's.<BR> The third, well the third is just outright ludicrous. The 3rd skelly is in City of Mist, all the way at the end of the castle near the boss mob. Now the mobs near the skelly are only mid 40's in level, but we have to go through a locked door with no known key (rogue), and the skelly is KoS to everyone and needs to be charmed to hand him the bottle (chanter or necro). Again a wizard at level 39 in 2 full groups around his or her level has no chance in hell of getting to the quest mob. Simply too tough for any level 39 wizard unless he brings his uber-guild with him.<BR> <BR>Splieve<BR>52 Wizard<BR>Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

So what does a Wizard unique? As we are damage first and evac second, it should be the damage that makes us special. This aint the case right now. 10% better than the 2nd best isnt that unique.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Okay, now that people have had a chance to discuss the list that Absor came up with, I figure it's time to throw some of my own thoughts in.<P>Judging by the apparent fact that most other classes are unsatisfied with the lists Absor came up with for them, I am inclined to make two conclusions:  1) The fact that the Wizard threads totalled more than double the next highest was not lost on Absor, and he thereby gave the subject of Wizard issues a prioritized level of attention.  2) Like some people were noting earlier, the whole job may be too much for one person, particularly seeing as how said person seems to be most uneducated about Everquest classes except insofar as what he's crammed as of late with his present assignment.<P>The Wizard list is lengthy and lists just about every complaint and proposed solution anyone ever offered.  Familiars and proximity spells were notable absentees.  This is, in fact, problematic.  There is no way 100% or even a majority of the items on the list will be implemented.  This means that the genuinely critical issues could be in danger of being ignored along with most of the list, which is an inevitability.<P>In my (educated, I humbly submit) opinion, as stated many times in older threads, the #1 problem with Wizards is their efficiency, or lack thereof.  Taking the problem to its extreme, the average L60 Wizard today does about half the damage over time of the average L60 Warrior.  An increased mana pool is no solution; people who believe it is should consider this analogy: Would increasing the fuel capacity on a car by 20% improve its mileage?<P>Our inefficiency is a fact that people in the game acknowledge on a subconscious level, even when they don't specifically know why it is that Wizards suck in a group, and this is the mental tag that results in Wizards having extreme difficulty getting a group.  They are a burden, not an asset.  Let me quote someone from earlier:<P>&gt; Oh and another things...Lures are great BUT :<BR>&gt; 1. Their dmg/mana ration is appalling and so compared to melee's we still suck at dealng damage.<P>The only thing wrong with this observation is that even the most efficient direct damage spells in the game, namely Sunstrike (L60) and Ice Spear of Soloist (L60), are insignificant next to the most basic melee damage (Warrior).  Lures are an extreme example, and actually not the most common scenario.<P>My original proposals all centered around boosting the Wizard's eventual direct damage efficiency to something on the order of 8 damage for every 1 mana, because this would allow us to at least compete with basic melee (Warrior) damage.  It would by no means make us a better choice over any other pure damage class.  However, since this modest proposal does in fact necessitate DOUBLING a Wizard's efficiency, I figured it was likely the maximum Verant would ever do for us.<P>I reiterate comments from one of my earlier posts: Wizards offer one thing to a group, and that's damage.  Warriors offer the best tanking in the game.  And even Rogues can tank at least to some degree, and their damage output is just about double that of a Warrior, or _quadruple_ that of a Wizard!  So as a matter of fact, my outrageous-yet-modest proposed efficiency upgrade was absurdly inadequate.  This doesn't change the near certainty that Verant will fail to see it that way.<P>I see a lot of people calling for "group friendly" solutions for Wizards.  I'm afraid I have to step on that train of thought.  Wizards are nukers.  It's their persona, their specialty, their calling card.  Verant probably isn't happy with the idea of turning Wizards into group buffers and I submit that they don't have to.  A Wizard has ONE JOB.. but if they are suddenly able to do that ONE JOB better than every other pure damage class in the game, I guarantee you that will be some undeniable group qualification.  If Wizards can suddenly nuke and maintain a damage output similar to that of a Rogue, grouping problems will be a thing of the past.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>(Continued from my last post)<P>I just spied Absor's post, closely preceeding my own.  I hope that doesn't mean I'm too late to re-cover issues.  I'll discuss some of the items he commented on.<P>&gt;&gt;”I still see not even one mention of anything even remotely group friendly.<BR>&gt;I’m listening. Make some suggestions. But there’s a caveat. Do it without turning the wizard into one of the other classes (I’ve seen requests for massive crowd control...).<P>This snippet suggests to me that Absor and I are thinking along the same lines, ie that Wizards are not group buffers and never have and probably never should acquire group-friendly abilities.  As I outlined in my last post, the true solution is to enable Wizards to perform their one and only job to a degree that is in far excess of any class that has our job PLUS some other job (like Magicians who can buff/debuff, Warriors who can tank).  Rogues are basically the only other class that has pure damage as their only mentionable job, and for that they enjoy the status as the #1 damage dealers, while Wizards are a stark contrast at dead last.  The ugly truth is that we should be on par with Rogues.  And let me take a brief time-out to stipulate that there should be no unique and highly unlikely necessitations to our power, such as the ever-popular "AE party" argument.<P>&gt;&gt;”ITEM: The level 4 spell Icestrike is a rain spell, but its spell gem has a green background instead of an orange one like every other rain spell in the game.<BR>&gt;Easy enough to add to the list<P>Not sure why this was mentioned.  This is an item that belongs on a totally different (hypothetical) EQ thread, that of aesthetics.  I happen to be developing a list of items that are unrelated to class balance but are instead old (ancient, usually) bugs or gripes with the game's visual, audio, gameplay, etc., and since Verant is apparently in the process of trying to make imporovements, I may eventually start the thread myself.  (One item I would be sure to mention is how any Erudite wearing anything but a robe is basically guaranteed to have parts of his "blue pajamas" showing, due to the laziness of the bitmap developers.)<P>&gt;&gt;”-As has been mentioned earlier by others, EFFICIENCY of blasts was not addressed directly<BR>&gt;Actually, I think I did address this directly.<P>Yes, you did, thanks.  It was the second item listed, below the no-brainer of "mana regeneration".  Both issues are linked, of course.  You could make direct damage nukes (with Clarity2) efficient enough to match a Rogue's output, or you could increase a Wizard's innate mana regeneration to accomplish the same, the latter of which would be the shortest, easiest solution.  I will warn you in advance that we are talking about a more than 100% increase in overall efficiency, not some token enhancement.<P>And I should also mention that an upgrade to Harvest is one idea that would go over very, very badly with the Wizard community.  The fact that Wizards have to give up a spell slot simply to keep the meager pace they are currently able is something we are already not especially pleased about.  A new or improved Harvest would simply mean that the Wizard would have to watch the clock and be even more prepared than usual to be low on mana so he can enjoy the full efficiency of that mockery of a spell.<P>&gt;&gt;In order to land a spell, our alleged specialty, we have to take a huge cut in total damage and mana efficiency. Why should this be true?<BR>&gt;Because the can affect the target more easily, they are more efficient than other spells that will be more resisted (or always resisted).<P>That's fine as far as it goes, as long as you remember that the resistances in Kunark and SoV scale in such a manner that most high-end encounters demand Lures, and therefore do not give Wizards any option BUT to sacrifice efficiency.  And of course beyond all that, we return to the fact that Wizards are doing, under ideal conditions, half the damage of a Warrior and one-quarter the damage of a Rogue.  Note that I am not arguing for faster damage or the ability to do 40000 damage to a single ubermob so much as the capacity for damage output over time (ie, efficiency), which has always been what I have stressed.<P>&gt;Fixing Al'Kabor is a great step, but it is always going to be a specialty AE, every level that has only Al'Kabor spells really should have another option as well.“&lt;<BR>&gt;Well, I disagree. I like the idea that players need to find new ways to do things, that they have to learn to use new spells every on occasion.<P>I agree with you here, Absor, but be very careful where you go with this train of thought.  AE parties will never REMOTELY be the norm for grinding and you tread dangerously close to suggesting that a solution to Wizard inefficiency might be to force Wizards to seek out such opportunities.  I say again that when the party's over and it's time to get armor from Kael or PoG, a Wizard is going to put his fun AE's away and get back to business.<P>&gt;IF invis to undead goes away, there will not be some sort of requirement to add something else. IF it’s removed (and I’ll admit that it’s unlikely) it will be for balance reasons, not just so that we can add something else.<P>Good place to chime in with my thoughts on Invis vs Undead for Wizards.  My feeling is that this was added as a direct response to the pure absurdity of Necromancers not only having BOTH invisibilities but also an item that allows them to cast regular invis _instantly_, avoiding any danger whatsoever associated with the failure of the buff.  Invis vs Undead was always more useful than regular Invis anyway.  Try running invis through, say, all of Sebilis, which has no undead mobs, and you'll see what I mean.<P>As for keeping it or removing it, well, putting it in was a hasty answer to a much older dumb predicament (imho).  No comment on this.  I'd probably miss it if it was gone, though.<P>&gt;Already on the list. Look at some of the individual items. No, I didn’t write: ITEM: Make wizards do as much damage as warriors over the long fight. <P>It pleases me greatly to see you nod specifically at what people are getting at as far as efficiency goes.  I am worried that you seem to believe bumping Wizards' damage output up to that of Warriors would be an agreeable enhancement.  That would perhaps be true if we had AC in the 1200s.  Warriors are not the kings of melee, not by half.  (They are, instead, balanced in that respect, by virtue of being the quintessential tanks in the game.)<P>&gt;The one thing I seem to have missed is any real method of making wizards more group friendly. But it seems that most of the ideas I’ve seen to do that are pretty... out of whack.<P>Well again, people are reaching for concepts because not everyone realizes what Wizards have been lacking all this time (efficiency, of course).  The closet psychologist in me tells me that they watch other classes fulfill their respective jobs in an efficient manner and begin to yearn for the capacity to be useful, and cement the concept that by being given another class's abilities, they can in fact contribute.  So I reiterate that the real solution is to put our efficiency firmly "in whack", so to speak.<P>Before I go, I want to make my personal thoughts on the Wizard Epic known.<P>It's rare.  People point to Enchanters and Clerics and say, "Look!  Everyone's got one!  Where's my Wizard FA?"  The only thing wrong with this argument is that it assumes that all FA's were created equal.  Look at the stats and effects.  They are similar but there are clear winners and losers.  The Cleric and Enchanter FA's are winners.  More importantly, they are KEY to enhancing the effectiveness of raids.  The Wizard FA gives unlimited personal buffs.  Taken to the extreme of its efficiency, a Wizard could hypothetically tank for about 20 seconds per mob and alleviate some of the usual necessary tank healage.  Aside from that, it's no asset to anyone but the Wizard.  (And it bears repeating that the resists on it are the lowest total of ALL FA's.)<P>Now look at it from that perspective.  That means you're competing against your fellow Wizards, not your Cleric or Enchanter friends.  And for the time being, the Wizard FA is exactly what FA's were assumed to be in the first place: A rare treasure that the owner can take real pride in owning.  I frankly feel SORRY for Clerics and Enchanters; their treasures were stolen from them and they HAVE to get their FA's just so they can be fully effective!<P>If Verant increased the rate of FA acquisition for this and other similar FA's, they would be undermining the efforts of everyone who DID THE WORK and got their rare treasures and deserve to own them.<P>Thanks for reading.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree with what Rets have said in his post. <P>From Absors post.<P>"Evaks and damage are what wizards bring to a group, and I think that should be enough, if it’s all working right."<P>I also agree with this. This IS what wizards are and always where intended to be. BUT there is a fundamental inbalance in the design of this archetype.<P>The wizard is 100% about damage (people dont evac nowadays, you gain more from a cleric ress than to run for 45 min to get back to yer hunt location) But our total damage output is extremely inferior to that of any melee class, only 10% better than other casters MAX and as damage is all we add thats the core of the problem of why we are not welcome in groups.<P>My suggestion to solve this:<P>1/ As Damage is all we are we should be able to do substained magical damage to rival the best melee damage classes, namely warriors and rogues, and be able to keep doing that same high amount of damage overtime.<P>That means our damage per point of mana must more than quadruple and our manaregeneration has to more than quadruple also to help us keep a sustained damage output. <P>2/ Then there has to be a way to controll agro created by such a damage output as compared to rogues and warriors wizards are not damage takers as well as dealers and do not have evade. <P>Buffing up the effect of concussion would be a way to solve that. As for now concussion has LESS effect on reducing agro than the ranger spell jolt has and concussion is resisted most of times wich means we will have a dead wizard.<BR>Fix concussion as well and make it more effective and less resited then leave it to the wizards to controll their own agro which will be a balance on a knives edge with a real damage output. Also make wizard spells taunt a bit less to make using concussion even possible.<P>3/ Evacs are as of today worthless, especialy at higher levels, because of the time loss they cause on groups. And as loss of time is loss of exp groups rather take a death and a ress than an evac. Evacs today are only used by wizards and druids to travel.<P>To solve this: <BR>Make a WIZARD evac spell that will take your group to the ZONE LINE of the current zone you are in. That way saving time for the group and that will make the spell somewhat useful again.<P>This may have been the idea with Evacuate. But Evacuate take you to the zone "Safe spot" wich is in most zones everything else but safe and nowhere close to the zone line.<P>Either modify the Evacuate spell by moving the zone safe spots close to zonelines and Fix the agro clearing issues of the spell, or create a new spell for wizards that takes our groups to zonelines.<P><BR>How would this make us stand towards other classes?<P>Mages and druids would still be more groupfriendly than us because of they array of spells and their pets, heals and damageshileds that making wizards have their rightful damage mastery would only put us at even footing with these classes. Melee classes will still be the primary choise mainly because they are teh damage TAKERS aswell as dealers so making wizards comparable damage dealers is not going to affect balance.<P>Fixing our damage output so we can keep a substainely large damageoutput rivaling rogues and warriors over the long time frame will in short fix the wizard class as if we do that amount of damage we would be useful in groups, but only if our manaregen was scaled after this so we arent turend to 2 minute men or even 10 second men again and that way unwanted in groups.<P><BR>I hope you Absor and the design team will see the same solution to the problem and maybe finaly after 2 years fix the wizard class with more than a bandaid.<P>Sorasil Lorewind<BR>lvl60 Sorcerer<BR>Paradigm<BR>Solusek Ro </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>TO THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM VIA ABSOR<P><BR>ITEM: mana regeneration <P>THIS is a REQUIRED for all casters NOW to begin the balance of the caster versus melee imbalance that exists.  This is needed for all levels as the trickle down of better gear pre-kunark to melee class has skewed the basic caster melee equation into the low thirties.  The trickle down of gear from velious is just beginning and its effects will further skew this imbalance to even lower levels and make the midlevels worse than they are now.<P>A token fix here will produce no good results.  You guys study this in combination with efficiency and resists to ALL casters.  This is not an option but a necessity in the entire life of the caster.<P>ITEM: Spell efficiency<P>SEE ABOVE AND IS REQUIRED FOR ALL CASTER CLASSES FROM ONE TO SIXTY FOR THE SAME REASONS. Forget about the damage of mages, druids, and necros compared to wizards.  FIX the caster imbalance first then work on the individual class differences in your vision of them.  DO NOT<BR>fix class imbalance before you fix the basic caster=melee imbalance. <P>The scientific method  (and its clear you are not using this) requires that the basic sides of an equation must be equal first, then changes to one side of that equation must be met by an opposite but equal change on the other side of the equation.<P>YOU have a basic desing flaw now because of a lack of understanding of the basic equation for the game.  YOU FIXED ONE SIDE OF THE EQUATION SINCE BEFORE KUNARK WAS BEING DESIGNED AND NEVER TOUCHED THE CASTER SIDE.  KUNARK AND POST 50 PLAY INCREASED THAT GAP.  STILL FURTHER ENHANCEMENT OF THE MELEE SIDE OF THE EQUATION AND INEFFECTIVE CASTER FIXES(NON RECOGNITION OF THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM OF THE ORIGINAL FLAW STILL WORKING ITS WAY DOWN) PUSHED THE ENVELOPE FURTHER AS VELIOUS WAS RELEASED.  <P>SURELY YOU REALIZE NOW THAT ALTHOUGH THE CASTER FIXES WERE NICE, THEY WERE WAY BEHIND THE MELEE CURVE FOR BALANCE.<P>VEILIOUS AND ITS INEVITABLE TRICKLE DOWN WILL ONLY MAKE IT WORSE.<P>BALANCE THE BASIC EQUATION IF YOU CAN,THEN WORRY ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL CLASSES.  THESE ARE TWO SEPARATE ISSUES AND YOU MUST BALANCE THE BASIC EQUATION BEFORE ATTEMPTING THE CLASS BALANCE.<P>ITEM: Percentage damage spells<P>Same as above.<P>ITEM:  Level cap on spells<P>Put same level cap on melee where they simple cannot damage a mob at all or remove it from the caster side of the equqation.<P>ITEM: Alkabor<P>This has nothing to do with balance, forget about it.  They suck and you cant fix em.  The game is not geared to ae play on any scale with overcrowded servers.  It makes no sense to crowd an already crowded game.<P>ITEM: Flaming Sword<P>Leave it alone and we can let it go to last page of never used spells where it is now. NOT an issue for balancing the basic Melee Caster equation.  Mages and Necros have their pet=better sword and thats just fine with me and prolly most wizards.<P>I mean, what the hell is the point of the thing??/<P>ITEM:Harvest<P>A WIZARD specific item that needs improvement but needs to be considered in with the basic caster melee equation and issuse in the first two items.<P>ITEM: RAIN spells<P>AGAIN refer to first two items. FIXING a specific damage spell needs to be considered within the basic melee caster equation first.<P>ITEM: Atol's <P>WHAT is the fizzle thing post 50 in a caster class that is way behind already.  Fizzles got worse post kunark. ELIMINATE fizzles post 50. What is the point.  Give a resonable explaination of this???????  What is the logic here for balance and fun.<P> LOOK AT FIZZLES ALONG WITH RESISTS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FIRST TWO ITEMS OF THIS POST AND FOR GOODNESS SAKE, GET REAL.<P>ITEM:Snare/enstill<P>Most wizards never use em work on item one and two above first priority. To heck with em, none of this line is usefull to a wizard now.  Fix them later, fix balance first.<P>ITEM: invis vs undead<P>A comment like " I dont know why wizards get this in the first place" is not reguarded as an answer unless followed by because ........<P>I don't know why a paladin, enchanter, etc etc get it either.<P>ITEM:TELEPORT<P>Not the basic problem fix in later<P>ITEM: fade, shadowstep, and yonder<P>DOH<P>ITEM:Evacs, Abscond etc<P>Secondary problem should have been fixed at implementation if they were tested at all by the test team.

Whats the point here ?????<P>ITEM  Diamond Rod<P>Most wizards could give a hoot. Balance the basics first, you have a ton of pre 50 play crap like this, fix it when you can.

</FONT><HR>Back to older days when they did not have implemented group damage a wizard was seeing as an insanely powerful class (wizards could KS  because they delivered more damage than anyone in the group, I do remember that it also didn't happen all the time so some other classes could already surpass wizards' damage). <P>In the same time when dueling wizards were insanely powerfull when they had open space... root nuke nuke nuke nuke, a wizard could take a magician of same level with his pet. Class envy and some changes were made to the way spells worked more resists, root nerf(root used to work decently) and player reduced damage. Then group aggregated damage was also implemented. Now, due to changes made in the past, the class is broken... <P>A low level wiz cannot do more damage than other classes specially melee. With every new more powerful weapons high level players pass the weaker ones to low level melee players (it needn't to be very powerfull weapons but see how long it takes to a melee to get very decent equip these days) and casters really are becoming inefficient, mainly damage casters (necros, magicians and wizards). <P>Now look at higher levels: tons of insanely powerful melee items, haste items in abudancy. Melee damage has being tremendously boosted but magical damage (including mana efficiency) hasn't suffered almost no improvement at all. Can a wizard expect to win a duel at higher levels, like the older days? Something is terribly wrong. <P>What benefit to have a wizard in group?  Within a very brief period of time a melee class surpasses wizards damage which cannot sustain a decent damage ratio because he quickly goes oom. Also, if spell damage is increased without boosting wizards' physical defense they will die instantly due to the high aggro component of the spells.

</FONT><HR>&gt; Back to older days when they did not have implemented group damage a wizard was seeing as an insanely powerful class (wizards could KS because they delivered more damage than anyone in the group,<P>Not quite.  A Wizard could KS because of the way the OLD kill-winner formula worked.  It went like this: The mob had a small list of names on its agro list (probably 15 or 16).  Whenever people did damage, that damage was added to their total and the sequence of names was reorganized to reflect total damage per person, most to least.  A person could get totally bumped OFF the list if 15 other people did more total damage than him, and he would end up having to start all over (and basically by the nature of how the list worked, he would have practically no chance of getting his name back in the hierarchy).  There was another item to consider: If, for example, a mob had 200 hp left, and a Wizard nuked for 1120, only 200 points would count to his total (assuming he had a total still on the list).<P>Any Wizard worth his /played eventually realized that the way to "KS" was to wait until the time was ripe to do the maximum damage with his biggest nuke at the last possible second before the end of the fight.  This did not necessarily mean getting the kill shot, though that typically sufficed.  It was actually better to sink a huge nuke a split second before the mob died to someone else's damage.  Anyway, that's how that went, and you can see that Wizards did not have to "out-damage" anyone in order to dominate the KS field (because I guarantee you, they were not out-damaging squat).<P>As of about the time of SoV's introduction, two changes were made: First, the "kill winner" rules were changed, ending the Wizard's dominance of this ability.  Second, Lures were nerfed.  Nobody said a word about the new "KS formula" because we were too busy trying to get Verant to admit they had done something terrible to Lures (talk about bending over backwards).<P>I believe I have figured out the new KS rules.  Wizards can in fact contribute to the formula.  There's an item in the game that makes it easier but it's a dangerous thing to pursue either way.  I've said enough.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR> TO THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM VIA ABSOR<P>ITEM: I FAILED TO MENTION IN MY PREVIOUS POST ONE OTHER THEORY FOR CONSIDERATION. THIS SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO MELEE CASTER IMBALANCE.<P>IF YOU LOOK AT THE BASIC BALANCE ISSUE BETWEEN MELEE, CASTER, AND THE UTILITY CLASSES, YOU MUST CONCLUDE THAT THE PURE MELEE IS THE WARRIOR, THE PURE CASTER IS THE WIZARD, AND THE PURE UTILITIES ARE THE ENCHANTER AND CLERIC.  ALL OTHER CLASSES ARE HYBRIDS OF THOSE THREE BASIC CLASS GROUPS WHICH GIVE YOU FOUR CLASSES.  THE OTHER TEN ARE HYBRIDS OF EITHER MELEE,CASTER,AND UTILITY.<P>THE EFFECT OF THE PURE CASTER IS MANA DEPENDENT. THE EFFECT OF THE PURE MELEE IS HITPOINTS.<BR>THE EFFECT OF THE PURE UTILITY IS TO AID THOSE TWO DEPENDENCIES, HIT POINTS(AND HOW FAST YOU LOOSE THEM} AND MANA REGENERATION.<P>WHAT ARE THE BALANCING EQUIVALENTS OF ALL TYPES OF HEALS, BUFFS, AND OTHER UTILITY SPELLS FOR THE CASTER SIDE OF THE EQUATION.<P>NOTICE I SAID EQUIVALENT.<BR>I.E.  IF A SHAMAN SLOWS A MOB HOW MUCH DOES THAT ADD TO THE MELEE HP?  WHAT IS HIS EQUAL BUFF TO THE CASTER SIDE TO PRESERVE MANA?<P>IS CLARITY BETTER THAN OR EQUAL TO SLOW?<BR>IS MALAISO EQUAL TO OTHER SHAMAN MELEE SIDE BUFFS?<P>WHAT ABOUT THE CLERIC COMPLETE HEAL NOT TO MENTION THE OTHER HP UTILITY HEALS.<P>WHERE IS THE MANA REGEN EQUIVALENT OF THAT??  WE KNOW OF COURSE THERE IS NOTHING REMOTELY CLOSE. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THIS BASIC IMBALANCE BY INNOVATION NOT NERFING THE HEALS.  YOU NOW HAVE MOBS WHERE IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE GAME TO CONTINUE.<P>THE ANSWER TO THESE QUESTIONS WHEN YOU ADD ALL THE UTILITY AID TO THE CASTER AND MELEE SIDE OF THE EQUATION IS CLEARLY OBVIOUS IN MY OPINION.<P>DONT JUMP TO WEAK FIXES, CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE BASIC BALANCE AND FIX IT. THEN MOVE LATER TO THE CLASS BALANCE INDIVIDUALLY.  WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL CLASS CHANGE IS MADE TO BALANCE THEN A CORRESPONDING TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BASIC EQUATION WILL BE NECESSARY TO A DEGREE BUT NOT TO THE SAME DEGREE AS THE BASIC MELEE CASTER EQUATION.<BR> <BR>THIS REQUIRES TESTING AND CAREFUL CONSIDERATION BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION ON LIVE SERVERS.

For example :<P>1. Single target mess<BR>2. AoE Root<BR>3. AoE Stun ? with 8 sec duration?<P>And finally, more group friendly Wizard spells.  Why is it that the Wizard spells are solely to do with the Wizard ? I'm not quite sure how you managed to come by this thinking...but Wizzies *should* imo, be used for group spells also.<P>e.g.  Cast a spell on all melee in the group that procs a low level dmg spell onto their weapons and that at the same time when procs gives you mana back ?<P>Just an idea  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Dunx<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Excuse-me Absor, this is not flame ok? It's just <P>On staff of temperate flux:<P>Absor wrotes:<P>&gt;&gt;One item, not really a big deal, I would think. And maybe it was never intended to be as good as Tashan...&lt;&lt;<P>The staff of temperate flux doesn't lessen magic resistance, only ice and fire. It cannot be compared to Malise or to Tashan in that way. Against many mobs it needs Tashan prior before it sticks. And it's overwritten by other spells, as I have read here. Once, it had insanly quick fast cast rate so it was known as "Taunting Stick" it was useful for taunting. Several times I saved the healer or the enchanter by using it. That was why it was useful not because of it's effect which is pretty little. With the increased activation time it lost its usefulness and we could not rely on it to effectively taunt mobs(you could not be sure if you'll pull the mob off someone in need). On the other hand it aggros too much for the effect it has.<P><BR>On innate resistance drop after 35 (included):<P>&gt;&gt;Never heard of this. I don’t even remember it being mentioned in the threads, or ever in all of my time with EverQuest, as a player or tester or employee. Are you sure this isn’t one of those famous EQ myths? I’ll add it to the list. I at least want to find out about it.&lt;&lt;<P>I don't know if it was a placebo effect but when I turned 35 I really felt that my spells were resisted less, perhaps it's not working after 50 (I haven't reached that with wizard yet). Be careful on this matter, I think many players will be aggro if it wasn't implemented. Please read the patch messages, it was in there, somewhere between 18 to 10 months ago.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt; YOU MUST CONCLUDE THAT THE PURE MELEE IS THE WARRIOR, THE PURE CASTER IS THE WIZARD<P>While I agree with your posts in general (if not your caps-lock key :^P ), I have to disagree with this.  There are several classes for whom damage is their primary job.  The Wizard is the purest damage class among casters because this is all he offers in a fight.  The Warrior is not the purest damage class among meleers because he offers the best tanking in the game, another essential job.  The Rogue can tank but most people wouldn't call them good tanks.  His only job in a fight is damage.  The Rogue is the purest damage class among meleers.  And as mentioned before, he enjoys quite a boon in this field because of his lack of versatility.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Group Friendly Spell Ideas<P>You wanted some, so I'm putting out a few ideas.  <P>Ricohet DD's<BR>-If the mob is aggroed on the wrong guy(magic user/rogue/ranger), a wizard can bounce their DD off a tank to hit the angry mob.  The mob interprets this big DD as a swipe from the tank, and gets mad at him.  Can only be cast on group members.<P>AE Aggro<BR>-Wizard casts his Red Flag of Aggro on the plate tank and all mobs in melee range of the tank will assume that the tank has done X damage to each of them for a short period time.  A bit like Concussion, this would only wipe aggro caused by *AE spell damage*.  Can be cast on group members only.  I'm thinking Alakabor wouldn't mind if his line of spells were altered.<P>Share Debuff<BR>-The wizard casts a sort of buff that gives other casters the same debuff that wizards supposedly get at level 35.  Great spell on raids.  About time other classes found out just how "good" the 35+ debuff supposedly is.<P>Lower Evocation<BR>-Another group buff that would also help wizards keep up with exp groups.  This line of buffs would lower the mana cost of *evocation-based* spells for both the wizard and friends.  CLERICS AND ENCHANTERS WANT TO NUKE TOO SOMETIMES.  Can only be cast on group members.<P>Lower Ice cost<BR>-Lowers the mana cost on ice-based DD for group members.<P>Lower Fire cost<BR>-Lowers the mana cost on fire-based DD for group members.<P>Lower Magic cost<BR>-Lowers the mana cost on magic-based DD for group members.<P><BR>Increase Specialization<BR>-This group buff would significantly increase the chance of specialization spell skill going off, whether that be evocation, alteration, etc.  Because wizards are all about specializing in one skill.  Would increase with level.  For group members only.<P>Mana Mark of Karn<BR>-This one's a biggie.  In order for the wizard to keep up with fast melee groups who deal out tons of twinkie melee damage, he casts this spell on a tank right before a fight.  As the tank does melee damage, the wizard recieves a % of mana based on the amount of melee damage done.  If a tank successfully swings for 30 damage, the wizard gets 6 points of mana added to his pool.  For group members only for obvious reasons. <P>That is the best idea I have to balance wizards against the ridiculous twinks running around these days and the overpowered melee gear coming out of Kunark and Velious.  This spell should be quest/mob drop-only, just like all melee gear.<P>Melee Proc Buff<BR>-This idea was shot down by Abashi but since you're 10x cooler than he is(I know that means alot to you), I think you should give this idea another bit of consideration.  The wizard casts a spell on the tank which works like a reverse damage shield.  Only it causes the tank to randomly proc a DD from about 10 levels below the wizard's current level.  If it could also proc an AE DD we'd really be cookin.  For group members only.<P>Indoor-only spells<BR>Hey, you gave druids outdoor-only spells.  Maybe we should have an edge in dungeons since we share evacs with them.  Wizards are all about dungeons.  This could apply to any one of the aforementioned spell ideas listed above.<P>OR<P>Indoor-only SOW<BR>Sounds weird I know but it's an idea.<P>Indoor-only DD's<BR>These spells only work indoors but have much better mana efficiency, damage and lower aggro.  When was the last time you saw a wizard soloing in a dungeon??<P>Increased Frenzy Damage<BR>-This one's kinda mean and would probably come off as a nerf to some players but maybe make it to where mobs hit MUCH harder when at 40-25% health.  Wizards are generally seen as "finishers" since they can't cast till the mob is half-dead anyway.  If mobs started hitting really hard when low on health people might start seeing the need for "fast damage".  <P>TO SUM UP.<P>Wizards are all about nuking.  Everybody loves to nuke.  Any class that can do it, even hybrids with their laughable DD spells, will do it whenever possible.  While I think meleers deserve an important part of the group damage per fight, I think wizards already sacrifice enough in terms of versatility and AC.  They should be much better at it.  See also; rogues.  They can't tank, so they do tons of melee damage.  Wizards ATM can't buff or heal, so they should be able to do tons of damage, with resists and aggro as the moderating factor.<P>If wizards are improved significantly it might be hard for other classes to accept(class envy, as Abashi liked to say).  But keep in mind that wizards, like enchanters and clerics, DO NOT come with a full set of solo spells.  We come close, but fall short without SOW.  We should either be good at one or the other.  I'd personally much prefer to be good in groups.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well Absor YOU said:<P>"Evaks and damage are what wizards bring to a group, and I think that should be enough, if it’s all working right."<P>Do you think that all it´s working right?<P>At level 39 a cleric become THE BEST HEALER CLASS. Yes that´s working right for them. No one can heal like a cleric. END OF THE STORY they are the healers of NORATH. <P>Now lets see the nukers at lvl 39: <BR>-Magician Nuke for 319 (lvl 34 spell!!!) + pet + Damage Shield. <BR>-Druid Nuke for 282 + heal + buff (some of they very great group buffs)+ evak to safe spots.  <BR>-Wizard can nuke for 380 (but wait a bit because you can aggro and you will be dead very fast) + evaks to a dangerous/useless place (Emerald jungle, West karana). <P>Do you think that´s working right? Do you think that we Wizards are the NUKERS in all Norath? When we wizards become the Nukers? Maybe 44? NO. <P>And please dont tell me that your mana ratio and cast/recast times are a BIT better. Compare the ratio of ONE Complete Healing VS ANY nuke of a wizard. Thats what i want ( LOL i dont want to kill a MOB at 39 whith a single nuke  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ) i want to be THE NUKER, because Absor say Druids were the "masters" of Teleports/Evaks i think  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> . I am agree whith wizards are not buffers but please a rogue dont buff and he can OUTDAMAGE us...<P>And WHY Absor please explain me WHY are mobs that are TOTALY resistent to magical Damage? What can a wizard do then? Bind Wound the tanks? Make /rudes to the Mob (maybe he agroo and kill us  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> )?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>While all posted problems/solutions are relevant for Wizard class, I believe that following 3 problems should be our main concern:<P>a)	Usability of Wizards at high HP Uber mob (&gt; 32k HP) raids<BR>b)	Usability (effectiveness) of Wizards in exp groups <BR>c)	Solution for Items to increase Wiz effectiveness at same rate as they do for tanks<P>A- suggestion: high mana regen discipline, lasts 15 min, recast time 2 hours, regen mana while standing too, regen speed fast enough so in average big Velious fight Wiz can deal same dmg as average tank (say 50 mana per tick regen, = like 9000 additional dmg over 15min fight )<P>B – suggestion: supporting class that can cast Complete Mana Fill ( like cleric Complete Heal do to tanks). This CMF spell wont help much at big raids ( since if you have 10 tanks, you CH only those that take hits – that’s few out of 10, while you would have to CMF all 10 out of 10 Wizards after they are OOM. That’s why suggestion A is more helpful in big raids ). But in everyday groups hunting for exp, having CMF would enable Wizards (and other INT casters!) to have same effectiveness as tanks do. In order not to be exploited (like you CMF clerics, and they then CH tanks) spell should only work on INT based casters, and support class who cast it should be WIS based (like druids. Btw, that would increase druid usability in groups too :)<P>C – This problem is twofold. <BR>1)	as someone stated already, tank lvl 50 with items obtainable now can do noticeable more dmg than tank lvl 50 1 year ago, while wiz lvl 50 can do very much same dmg now compared to 1 year ago. New items don’t help Wizards noticeably.<BR>2)	 Items are important part of EQ, as well as obtaining items is important part of playing EQ. But while good equipped tank can deal noticeable more dmg (say 40%) compared to poorly equipped tank, good equipped wizard (since stats are mostly Mana/INT) can do very much same dmg as poorly equipped wizard. Again, items don’t help Wizards (and other offensive casters)<BR>Suggestion (for wizards and ALL offensive casters):<BR>     Make stats on collected items increase caster efficiency at same level as they do for tanks. Make that for every mana point on items we have  0.1% more dmg on casted DD spells. Average good equipped wizard have 300ish additional mana, that would be 30% difference between good equipped wiz and bad equipped wiz – much closer to tank ratio. So, if I cast Lure for example, without mana items I still hit for 640max, but with 300 mana on items I hit for 832. This way new items (with more mana) would enable wizards/casters to keep pace with new weapons for tanks.<P>Nenad<BR>Wizard lvl 57<BR>Cazic-Thule<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor wrote:<BR>"I’m listening. Make some suggestions. But there’s a caveat. Do it without turning the wizard into one of the other classes (I’ve seen requests for massive crowd control...)."<P>1) Make an AE that is target based that will allow the wizard to cast this on the tank and it radiates out from the tank and THE TANK TAKES THE AGGRO.  Not every group can get an enchanter.  You have made some classes WAY to valuable to a group and others not valuable at all. With a enchanter on crowd control you DON'T have to zone, you DON'T have to die, and you DON'T have to evac.  You simply fight mobs one at a time because the rest are mezzed.  It seems the 50+ game for wizards is AE based.  At this point and time the only reason to AE is to quad kite.<P>2) Enchanters, shamans, bards and ITEMS can buff the haste of tanks and regen the mana for casters.  Druids, Rangers, and Mages have damage shields. Necros get one of the best buffs in the game with DMF.  Wizards are the masters of magical damage.  I am against us getting buffs because we are not a buffing class BUT  If I had to make a buff for the wizards it would be something that would ADD more damage to a tanks hits or the casters spells.  EQ can alter the speed of a tank and the speed of the mana regen.  It can atler the damage a mob takes when it HITS YOU.  We have yet to see a difference in the damage the mob takes when you HIT IT!<P>These 2 options are not balance issues.  You can only use the first one when grouped or you would get a message that says "The target is not in your group".  As for the second one, Well I guess it could also be casted on our selves.<P>Absor, if you seriously want to make a change to the wizard class and keep game balance and at the same time keeping the classes defined, then these 2 changes will do it.

Yes there were some "nit-picky" issues posted, and some of the issues had nothing to do with balance, but first and foremost the BIGGEST concern is that Wizards can't contribute to sustained pulls because we run out of mana so quickly. <P>Personally I don't want my Wizard to be like other classes but I want my Wizard to EXCEL at what  Wizards are supposed to do best, Magical Damage, if this is done correctly (which in my opinion it is not now) Wizards would be welcome members into groups.<P>If Absor and Verant do not get this then all is lost. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 13 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-11.html">11</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-12.html">12</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-13.html">13</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000784&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000784&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
