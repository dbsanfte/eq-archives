&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>The only three adjustments i see that need to be made are :<P> 29th lvl Suffocate is a worthless spell, for over double mana cost it is actually resisted 5x more by the same mobs i used choke on. Damage is nothing too, even at 30th, just a continuing of the tick of a choke, about 2x the lasting, for over double mana and literally 1/5 resists on 26th level mobs at thirty, sometimes double resists.. choke was never resisted, maby 1/25, but never twice in a row, since getting spell almost always 2x resists on same mob.. Especially considering this is only dot line, and we've waited yes, 17 levels for it.<P> All our AC buffs are a joke.. At lvl 29, obscure replaces Cloud with a 2ac bonus, not really worth it, and Umbra is same as Shadow at beginning, definately not worth it.<P> Even with 180 charisma, those same blue 26th lvl mobs resist beguile even cast at 30th with tashani on them alot, and when it does affect its only capped at 2 minutes max for me, with average only 30 seconds, and many only 2-3 seconds. Not only did it consume 120 mana on nothing, but the mob now hates me and will ignore the tank, and at 30th cause me to zone or die unless in a good group.<P> And last but not least the enchantment spells plain out suck. Enchanters were promised (yes promised) the ability to enchant items, and this tradeskill bonus is what makes up the enchanter quest. But somehow in two expansions you managed to upgrade many other classes in tradeskills to the point enchanters arent even needed anymore. The velium metal line was a welcome upgrade with blue diamond, but the stats were terrible upgrade compared to others for double the cost of platinum. Other classes now rival the enchanter in tradeskills, and with it easier to buy your plat or velium pieces now, you can play a shaman with the much better alchemy ability.. Or a wood elf or halfling tailor now with race only and new velious tailoring, or any race pretty much now for better blacksmithing, the high elf stuff is a joke. Why bother playing enchanters for 5 spells, when every other enchanting class can imbue items, or make better stuff in tailoring, hell even fletching, baking, brewing, and smithing now.. We get about 3 other enchant spells that are worthless, and have only one goal, like making a potion to make Wu's Gauntlets, which is used 1-10 times maybe in the whole of an enchanters career, and wasnt even worth getting the 12th lvl spell until 30th.<BR> <BR> My suggestion, do what you promised, and give us the ability to cast another line of tradeskill skills that will make everyone love the sight of an enchanter again. A lvl 39th spell Charge Item wouldn't hurt, basically recharge one item in your hand, for over 1000 mana. A 49th lvl SKILL Bind Item, where you can combine a melee weapon and a spell scroll lvl 29th or below in your Tome of Endless Enchantments to bond a random number of charges of that spell to the weapon. And finally, a lvl 60 SKILL or upgrade to Bind Item, where a 29th lvl spell scroll and melee item is bonded to give it a permanent effect.. A proc not a clickable or anything. <P> Those improvements are all we need as a class, last one especially. We are resigned to the fact our pets stink and are never summoned, and charm is always used, at least for me, but please make charm stronger duration and less resist. We also don't care about our DD, they are supposed to stink, and dots just need a little improvement. <P> But overall, with other classes exceeding us in every area, with illusions, better buffs, just as equal footing in tradeskills, and much better pets and damage output, our saving grace is crowd controlling mez. Enchanters are my favorite class, and all my mains will always be enchanter, but lately i've started a cleric and rogue, and with cleric a master dwarf blacksmith, he can put out nearly as good items as my enchanter, in only 1/20th the time of play.. <P> Thanks for hearing my ideas...<P>Indikan Addagram <P>31st Enchanter Rallos<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Something to remember during all of this discution is that not very many Enchanters that play alot post here, ypou are making earthshaking changes in the class with the opinion of the minority,(I play an enchanter as my main and have never posted here befor in my 8 months of playing, i am only posting now becuase i read some of the things that will be on the "LIST" that frighten me as an enc.) I am not sure this is very wise at all.<BR>Also seeing that this discution was never annocuonced in-game or in a patch message, you cannot say "we warned you" so to the hoards of enchanters and other classes who will be changed overnight for better or worse. Alot of ppl in game are just fine the way they are, they don;t need tuning or balanceing. Some times I think you listen to whiners to much and make changes based on there ranting which in turn leads to more ranting from other trying to get an advantage for themselves.<P>Just a few of my concerns.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>i posted a while back but didnt see it on the page i wonder why...anyways, ill post the same message again..im sorry for the double posting<P>message starts here<P>hi, i tried playing an enchanter and actually got him to level 8, but now starts my problem with the lull and mez line of spells, i was camping orc 2 with a group and for a while, my lull and soothe and mez spells were doing their jobs, i would lull 3 and tell our puller to pull a mob, there were 4 in the camp<P>first point, i lull 3 out of 4, why is it that when that happens 2 orcs always jump in when pulled? is it because of the lull range? i tried mez still the same result<P>second point, and this is really what ticks me off...after a little while, my spells were always resisted and all 4 or 5 orcs would just rape me, needless to say i died 5 times lost a lot of xp and the sheer frustration just made me want to quit.<P>is there something i am doing wrong here?<P>in my oppinion, enchanters cant do jack with melee so when lull (and others) is resisted, we die.  it is just utterly frustrating that you die and die on end. can you change this? maybe make mez and lull more potent, or maybe the mob wont aggro when it fails, i was thinking that the spell was like just suggesting to the mob that it should just calm down and stay there, if it fails, the mob just ignores the suggestion and not get hyper about a little voice in its head telling it to calm down.  <P>also, i mezzed a centurion since the group pulled a lego and a cent, the group cant seem to kill the lego so i decided to cast invis on me after spending about 3 or 4 mezzes on the centurion so that when the mob gets out of the mez, it doesnt go out and hunt me, but then, the orc attacks me like he sees me, i know my invis succeeded so why was he able to attack me? orcs dont see invis right?<P>please fix the enchanter class, i dont care if people say enchanters are too powerful I JUST DONT THINK SO, if they were then why would i die 5 times just trying to lull, also countless times that i almost died because i was crowd controlling with mez.<P>another point, people always say, tashan then mez...i just dont get it, how the hell can you tashan and mez when after casting tashan you cant pull off another spell because the mob's just too fast that after you cast tashan its all over you in a few seconds.  i might just be ignorant of the ways so show me.....but i still say fix the enchanters, theyre too hard to play and i wouldnt be surprised if people wont play them.  i mean wizards can kill with their nukes, magicians and necros have very strong pets, enchanters seem to be getting the scraps here.<P>please dont flame me alright, im a newbie and you were once too....just remember that.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have a few ideas for illusions that could be possible. I know they're not great things to turn into, but could be fun for all enchanters when they sometimes do get bored.<P>1) Illusion Snake. As seen in our epic quest, we are holding a snake, so why can't we pay tribute early in our careers to our upcoming heritage.<P>2) Illusion Orc. I don't see where there would be a global file issue, most zones have these in them. I'd like to stand by the camps and keep warm by the fire myself too.<P>3) Illusion Spider. This would be a fun spell to have, it could be the itty bitty one's or the bigger ones, doesn't matter to me.<P>4) Illusion Gnoll. Right up there with the Orc illusion.<P>Lemme just list a few more here quickly: Illusion Fire Beatle, Illusion Lion, Illusion Lioness, Illusion Crag...<P>Most of these have various factions in their respective zones, so I don't see these as being a balance issue or an overpowering illusion. These are just fun things that we enjoy to have, and I know I personally would enjoy being a snake, crawling on my belly...lol<P>Just consider them please is all I ask.<P>Thank you<P>Rhube</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just to throw in a couple more cents because I seem to have a differing opinon on pets.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>ANIMATIONS<P>I absolutely do not feel the need for a stronger, commandable, pet.  My animations are just fine, but they're situational.  I use them in outdoor situations when we have a mostly "kiting" group.<P>If I had to ask for one change, it would be make the higher level pets summon with 2 weapons (auto-dual wield) like the other pet classes.  Considering how situational our pets are, I don't understand how this could be concieved as unbalancing.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Personally, I find very little of the enchanter class to be wrong or un-satisfactory, although there are a few things I'd like to address, ( BTW, I apologize if I am repeating things.. I just don't have the time to read nearly 10 pages... )<P>A. Enchanter Animations...<BR>I really can not see why enchanter animations do not get pet commands.. Now, before you all say " Well because they arent really there, they are just conjured out of nothing...", lets look at the other pure caster pets...<P>Necromancer: This is a skeleton.. A DEAD CORPSE... no tendons, no muscles, no eyes, and oh ya, NO BRAIN. How is it that a skeleton, something DEAD can understand the command to attack something, or the command to stay still. Thats like ripping the flesh off of your friends corpse and telling it to do something.. Ya thats it....<P>Magician: Hmmmm Elementals. Elementals are just large amounts of the elements bound together in a shape by magic... They have no brain, no ears, no eyes... Why do they get commands?<P>For you that say that pet commands would make the enchanter class unbalanced, look at necromancers... They are by FAR the best equpied class in EQ.. They have thier pets ( commands AND capability of being given weapons ), really nice DoT, Life tap series so that they can just suck HP from low level mobs to regain lost life, Their own clarity, and many more with the only draw back being hated... You call that balanced?<P>B. Enchanter Illusions<P>I really dont think that it is fair or balanced for what other classes are getting for form changes...<P>Druids with Wolf Form: Perfectly ok with me. Its been in for months and it has very good uses..<P>Shaman with Bear Form: W T F... Why are you giving this to shamans?? That is completely taking away our shape changing ability! This leads me to necros...<P>Necromancers with Spectre form: I can not see how necros can get this, being the masters of un dead or not. If anything, enchanters should get all of these things...<P>C. Clarity Clarification<P>Why is it that Necromancers AND Druids have their own forms of clarity?( Self only ) Sure necromancers lose HP for it, and sure druids must be in one place ( tree ) for it, but they still have it! Now, instead of taking these abilities out of the game, why dont you give enchanters a self SoW? Being self only, we wont go runnin around with two of the most wanted abilites in the game, and we can easily get moving with it. You gave clarity to necros and druids, along with shape changes, why not give us SoW...<P>D. Magician Monster Summon<P>This completely draws the line for un fairness... Enchanters should have recieved an illusion to transform into a random zone mob WAY before magicians could summon one up... It use to be an amazing sight to see two giants battling it out.. But now, instead of being at awe with an enchanter's charming ability, people just shrug it off and say " Oh, thats just a magician's pet " This just is not fair... Oh, did youk now that even these pets have commands?...<P><BR>That is basically my thoughts on enchanters.. Being level 31, I do not know about plane raids or un godly MR. Yes my DD suck, ( BTW, level 24 Necro DD does more dmg then my DD at lvl 31  )<P><BR>Neplian Shapeshifta ( Surename kind of lost its touch )<P>High Elven Enchanter of TarewMarr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, well, well.. time to talk about enchanters.<BR>I've briefly read over probably about half the posts already in this thread, so I'll be touching briefly on a lot of things people have lready said but I'll try not to say the same things over.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>I'd like to start by stating that I don't believe enchanters to be any over powered class.  As one other person mentioned, enchanters should be the yardstick by which other classes are measured, since as it stands, enchanters and bards are the only two classes that currently reward smart, intelligent playing, and really seperate the people who know their class from those who don't.  <P>Much like clerics, enchanters are considered powerful due to their essential role a group, and the ability to make the impossible possible.  There is, however, a few things to consider in this regard.  Firstly, the old addage "it's a tough job, but somebody has to do it" comes to mind.  Secondly, there is a flipside to all of this.  Enchanters are so specialized in what they CAN do, that there are a lot of things they CANNOT do.  They cannot effectively nuke (the damage ratio on our spells are not bad, but they're all magic based and highly resistable), cannot really do any sort of pet damage at higher levels (except in highly specialized situations), and as a corralation, cannot really solo.  Sure, enchanters can charm-solo, but that's dangerous, and never as xp efficient as grouping (and impossible at most levels due to environments and types of mobs around).<P>A lot of what I'm saying here can be summed up as follows: enchanters don't need to be changed, at least much.  I've seen a lot of people post that enchanters should get controllable pets, get some sort elemental-based nuke... I highly disagree.  Giving enchanters the ability to effectively deal damage in a fight WOULD begin to imbalance the class, since it would eliminate the drawbacks we currently have.  It would be like giving clerics a nuke that was actually mana efficient.<P>And the suggestions to give some sort of visual sign that a mob is mezzed?  No way.  That would take away part of the art of being an enchanter, the art of grouping with an enchanter, and make killing in EverQuest even more mindless and simple than it already is.<P>As for the role of enchanters on a raid, and the problems of such... firstly, I've read people posting that it's pointless to have multiple enchanters on a raid.  Well, to a degree this is true.  I whole-heartedly disagree with the people who state that you can only have one enchanter mezzing things due to different mez spells not stacking -- I do this all the time on raids.  Entrance is my mez spell of choice, whereas other people prefer Dazzle.  We deal with it, and things get mezzed quite effectively.  You just need to use your head (there's that skill part of being an enchanter again...) and remember which things you've mezzed, and keep them mezzed.  Or if this is really an issue, co-ordinate with other enchanters on the raid, and use the same spell.  As for enchanters being useless in the big fights... well... yeah.  But it's just part of the class.  Should we really be essential to the buffing of the raid, and still be able to nuke with the big boys when it actually comes down to that?  Sounds to me like having our cake and eating it too.  If you really want something to do on a raid, start chain-casting Rune V on people.<P>The other thing I saw mentioned that sort of irked me were people suggesting that single target mezzes should be able to overwrite AE mezzes.  Damn, that would be sweet, but I think much too sweet.  Just start off any dangerous situation with an AE mez, and single target mez everything at your leisure?  Sign me up!  Seriously though, that would make crowd control entirely too easy.<P>Now to make a quick checklist of other burning points, and my thoughts on them:<P>- Lull spells: yeah, they're useless as they are due to their resist rate.  Would be nice if we could actually use them.<BR>- Whirl line: it's just plain broken in it's current form.<BR>- Religion/illusions: religion is meant to be a double-edged blade.  I'd like to think that your choice of god still matters, I don't see any great need to change this.<BR>- High-level illusions: not essential, but would be sorta nice to have.<BR>- Controllable pets: I covered that above.  No way, it would overpower the class.<BR>- Mezzing problems in Velious: certainly should be looked into.  I avoid Velious like the plague these days.<BR>- Debuffs: yeah, our stat debuffs (the disempower and weakness lines) don't seem to make any noticable difference in combat.  I'm not expecting much, but it would be nice if either the effectiveness of decreasing mobs stats or the actual stat decreases themselves were raised.<BR>- Short spell durations: except for the effect on my epic (which is a pain in the ass), I've never had a problem with spell durations.<BR>- Illusions dropping when zoning/ld: this is a serious point that really needs to be fixed.  I think it's wrong that we should be at the mercy of our internet connection when wandering through dangerous places with illusions on, particularly when this sort of behaviour is required for many of our quests and what not.  If fixing this would require having illusions stick when logging, zoning, etc. then so be it, but that's certainly the most important aspect to fix.<BR>- Sentinel: remove that spell.  It does nothing but lag about a 100 people when someone decides to cast it at the EC tunnel. :P<BR>- Mem blurs: well, mem blurs certainly do seem pretty useless 50+.  Not sure if this is intentional or not, but it's something worth bringing up and discussing.<BR>- Berserker Strength line: it would be nice if it stacked with strength buffs.  As it stands, they're pretty much unusable. (I currently only use them as self-buffs for the damage absorb component)<P>So, in closing, I think enchanters as they stand are a beautifully executed class.  Lots of fun if doing damage isn't your thing, and rewarding smart gameplay.  Some minor tweaking to current spells may be in order, but overall I think they need little in the way of subtractions, but not really much in the way of additions either.<P>Iadien Moonweaver<BR>55th Level Enchanter<BR>Brell Serilis Server<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here are some thoughts I have on enchanter spells...I play level 60 enchanter.<P>Tash line, great spell, Mega aggro. I've seen other spells like slow/etc (far more crippling than tash) land and then I cast tash and I get instantly summoned. I'd say this happens about 90% of the time on 51+ mobs. I can wait 3-4 seconds before casting it (with 5-6 melee wacking mob) and cast it and this still occures. While I agree some aggro should be attached to this spell it is far to much.<P>Additional, why is it I receive the message 'Spell recast time not yet meet' SO much with this spell or any of the quick-cast line of enchanter spells. I realize they fixed some exploit but when I jump to hit my tash because a mez didnt stick (resisted) and I get that message it causes problems. You can see the same effect with our quick cast stuns. Can you guys look into correcting this? It normally happens when I cast a mez spell then try and cast a stun/tash immediately afterwards.<P>WTYH line of spells... these are utterly useless for me. Bash/stun/etc breaks them almost the instant I cast. A good use for this spell would be that it works on mobs typically not mezable (giants/etc). Since the spell only lasts 6 seconds or so I don't see that it could be unbalancing. Would give this spell some use at higher levels at least.<P>Mask Faith spell would be great. I don't mind being one of the only followers of Mithaniel Marr and enchanter on my server but it sure would be nice if ALL of the enchanters were not agnostic =)<P>Illusions, we want more! I know the faction problem is a issue for things like major illusion (target a mob, cast it and become that type of mob) but I REALLY hope they can work a fix around this.<P>Sex change illusion would be rather interesting also, please add this spell! <P>Clarity spells should be sold, all of them. Thats our primary function outside of the mez line... why must people seek them out off mobs. Please increase the duration of this spell to at least 45 minutes to a hour... the tedium of casting this buff drives me bonkers!<P>I'm also not terribly impressed with our level 60 Gift of Brilliance spell. Compared to the other classes spells it's nothing that amazing. If the spell gave us effect of C2, +150 mana cap and lasted 2.5+hours I think it'd be more in like with say the cleric level 60 mega buff.<P>Boon of Garou, while it has a nice life tap proc and dex bonus... it is so overbalancing that we can only cast it on one person? Also, why is a level 44 spell (this one) limited to 44+ characters while some of my 51+ level spells can be cast on folks lower than that?<P>Cripple/Weakness line. To be honest I never use these spells unless on a large raid and we have several enchanters there already. Gives me something to do. However the percieved effect of these spells is almost nill. Casting weakness does NOT reduce the max damage of the mob... what does it do? Give us some effect from this spell that we can notice. Same for cripple, what does this spell DO to a NPC. We know it reduces agil/dex on a PC. The reduction does of agil/dex does almost nothing to the AC and thus is useless for a typical 6 person group. The mana cost and resulting effect of these spells is not worth it. Please consider these spells effecting directly, say weakness will reduce the max damage of a mob by 30 points, 120 max to 90 max damage, and cripple will reduce the targets AC by 30 or more. These type of effects would make both these spells VERY useful. Not only that ... shamans would use them a well =)<P>Enough from me, im sure you have tons of other suggestions, thanks for your time.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Thats pretty worthless to a 44th enchanter who has very limited use for melee.<P>Even the cold resistance of our 39th dog spell is at least situationally usefull.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>First off I would like to say these information gathering posts by Varent are very very cool; now lets see if any of the good ideas placed here will ever make it live.  Some of us still have a tiny bit of hope left.  <P>First off, Illusions:<P>There has been a great deal of talk about our illusions of late, and there is some reason for concern.  We don’t get any illusions after 44, and yet we have the title illusionist.  I could care less if we have the specter or bear illusions, but giving out two ‘illusions’ to others classes never had them and not allowing the enchanter, ‘the master of illusions’ to have post 44 illusions was just plain wrong.  I believe that our self-only illusions are fine as they are.  We could use more ‘group’ illusions or ‘area’/’location’ illusions; I’ll explain.<P>Illusionary Wall – an illusion that would block off hallways, tunnels, and doorways indoors.  This would reduce the beasty threat from wondering monsters and allow the group to med. in reasonable safety.  Beasties that spawn inside of a room could not run outside of a room without a door/exit, and reduce the possibility of trains.   Pullers would have some difficulty finding the hidden room but, then no illusion is perfect.  I’ll leave the duration, spell level and mana cost up to you guys.<P>Illusionary Terrain – an illusion that would cover an area round the group while they are in an outside setting.  All beasties/npc’s/players looking into the illusonary are will only see the normal terrain and none of the group.  Unless a beasty’s pathing would normally take it through the illusionary are they would not agro on anyone within unless someone from inside ‘gets’ there attention.  Again I leave the duration, spell level and mana cost up to you guys.<P>Illusionary weapon (form 1) – Unlike the No Rent mage summoned items, illusionary weapons could have a duration and fade after the spell duration has expired. The weapons would have stats similar to the mage summoned ones, but depending on the level of spell they could have a illusionary flaming effect or something.  How about illusionary thrown weapons, or arrows (flaming arrows would be cool).  <P>(form 2) – illusions can be cast upon already existing weapons to make them appear and feel (when you get hit) more damaging.  The illusion would effect the primary weapon on the person targeted and increase the base damage of the weapon by a few points while not effecting the weapons speed.  We can even go out on a limb here and add an enchantment component to the effect allowing it to flame, or proc for an effect.  <P>Modifying Existing Illusions:<BR>1. Lv 44 Group Werewolf duration can be increased a bit say to 10 min., 6 min is just to short to be effective.  Another small point, can we get the size of the Group Werewolf to be a little bit larger than the basic self only Werewolf illusion?  So we can tell them apart.  <BR>2. Illusion of a Dry Bone Skelly is removed by a Ice based druid dot spell (lv 50-54 don’t know the name of the spell) Bug? <BR>3. Illusion Spirit wolf should be able to be cast indoors it does not have any running boosts the druid ones do.   No reason to make it just outdoors, its not that great anyway.  <P>Changes to Existing spells:<P>1. Lull line is nearly useless and needs to be dropped or increased in effectiveness.  I have tried to use these spells throughout my 52 levels and have successfully racked up multiple deaths because they get resisted almost every time.  <BR>2. Whirl line was fine before the fix, but the way they stand now they suck.  Drop the line or increase the spell’s duration.  I would love to be able to whirl a giant that cannot be mezed.  How about a AE version of the spell?  I loved the idea of this series and would hate to see it go, but its nearly useless in its present form.  <BR>3. Tash line is one of out defining spells, but I find that even after a tash the resist rates to most beasties are still very high.  Enchanter spells must have some sort of penalty to effectiveness it appears; other pure casters cannot function if their spells were resisted as much as ours with or without tash.  I should be at least 60-70% effective on even RED beasties after a tash; this is simply not the case.  I can deal with the super taunt factor of the spell if I noticed a major reduction in the beasty’s resist rate; the effectiveness is simply not sufficient.  <BR>4. Weakness line has no noticeable effect on beasty, and therefore has a limited effectiveness outside of PVP.<BR>5 We used to have a Mana Dot that worked well, the one we have now is nearly useless in the 40+ game.  Further, I believe the gaining, transferring, and creating mana is an enchanter domain and should be expanded somewhat.  Breeze was a good addition in the lower levels, we need something in the Lv 34-49 range.<BR>6 Group buffs should also effect the pets in the group.  Further, I would like to see our group illusion Werewolf useable on our pets at least.  <P>Spells that I would like to see added;<BR>1. How about a Group Share Mana spell, which would allow the entire group’s mana to be placed into a single pool and accessed by each member.  The total amount of mana would still be the same amount, as would the rate of mana recovery.  <BR>2. How about a Friendly Mana transfer spell that can be used only on members of the same group. I certainly use the mana the bards never use.  One might argue that necros already have this spell, but it really should be a chanter spell not a necro one.  It was added to make necros more group friendly and in my opinion it should not have been.  <BR>3. Use the Thicken Mana line to create something useful. Here is an idea, how about a potion that chanters can make called “Essence of Mana” that grants 50-100pts of mana.  You guys will not have a more effective Money sink in the game.  If it cost 20pp in ‘materials’ to make and sells for 60pp, people, especially wizzies, will carry as many as then can get their hands on.  <BR>4. How about a tash spell that we can cast like a buff on players, this would make their spells harder to resist (kinda like the wizzy lure line), and reduce the total amount of resists. This would allow them to effect those nearly fully magic resistant beasties we are finding more and more of with each patch.  Have the duration be a short one like for one or two fights. It would only effect magic based spells.<BR>5. Temporary Weapon or armor enchantment spell line that was an aspect for the chanter concept from the start to be implemented. <P>Well that about all I can think of on the spot.  Two years as an enchanter is a title I ware proudly; hopefully some of these changes would keep me in EQ for an additional two years.  Positive changes are required to ward off the systematic board cycle of killing beasties.  The 50+ level game no longer holds excitement for me and I’m hoping that the ‘fun’ factor is reintroduced into the game.  <P>Xora Soulkatcher<BR>Lv 52 enchanter   <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello Absor  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Im only a level 50 enchanter now, but ive studied under the best (Atekah you caps using freak you know who you are).  Im going to get right to the point.  <P>In my opinion, this is the primary issue with enchanters in EQ today:  risk vs reward<P>What is the risk?  Enchanters ARE the most difficult class to play.  A good battle is a whirlwind of targeting, making snap decisions, casting, nearly dying after a round of combat, targeting, getting that mez to stick, targeting next NPC...and so forth.  Aside from this, guess who dies the most in a lot of groups?  The chanter.  <P>The very nature of crowd control means the chanters laughably low hps/AC and Megataunt spells will inevitably bring you to the attention of npcs who can kill you in 1-2 rounds of combat.  Chanters dont have the luxury of casting their spells on mobs that are being worked over by 3-4 tanks.  So chanters have to work their butts off to play effectively and what is their reward?  They spend a lot of time looking at their bind point.  Which usually means less exp also.<P>The megataunt on the spells is ridiculous.  4 tanks can be beating on a mob and have it down to 2/3rd life, all the while its getting dotted, its speed debuffed, and people are buffing the tanks.  I cast the 44 tashania on the npc and it jumps on me.  I wish reoccuring amnesia worked it sounds like it might actually help. The only purpose of the Lull series currently is to get lowbies killed a few times while they discover through trial and error that the spells dont do anything. <P>Finally, please increase the duration on the most commonly used buffs, and increase the mana cost proportionately.  The higher level ones cant be cast on the vast majority of players anyways (preventing PL being the driving force behind the low durations as far as i can tell)<P>Dechala <P>p.s. hi Twyl (Krikey!)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Gift of Brilliance, okay I know it has uses being able to stack with Clarity 2 and gives a regen of 2, first off, 150 mana...lets see thats what? half a Glamour of Kintaz?<P>Illusions, I'm not a fan of the gender bit, thought its something to add to my spellbook i just don't think a male with Aleria Truhart above the head just fits me.<BR>I am interested in the Armor illusions and putting them with maybe the ac line of buffs we have. As for the illusion of copying anything or a random monster in the zone I can't see why a super kos tag isn't put on it, copy something like the werewolf faction, i'm practically KOS to everywhere in werewolf form.<P>Whirl to you hurl and DDD, these are jokes i think i use them on myself when i'm bored and have tons of time and mana.<P>Verant stated that Enchanters are the Masters of the Mind, okay yeah we can charm just about anything...why do the Masters of the dead (necros) get a mana transfer spell and life transfer..now from a role play perspective the physical aspect of giving life to another at ones own cost sound necro like to me...giving mana to another person at ones own cost sure does sound like the person whos the master of the mind if you ask me.<P>Our animations suck, they where ment to suck at least compared to pets...but can we get /pet backoff or at least after whatever lvl have it auto dual wield? even if its like 49 and 55 pets only, i'm really annoyed about having to carry Fine steel to make my pet dual wield at lvl 57, to me its just a hassle to go and find fine steel.<P>As it was stated earlier illusions are not to mask the religion completely. From roleplay view thats just stupid that an npc can see into my head and know i worship erollisi marr. From the game view i understand that npc's have to know my religion because they need to know how to react...every enchanter that knows the tiniest bit of knowledge about enchanters when they start knows to make their religion agnostic because if not then basically kind of screwed in essence. <BR>What about us pioneering enchanters, i made my enchanter when very little was known about them and now because i chose a deity to worship all the evil races don't like me much even in an evil race. same thing with tunare followers, if you didn't follow tunare and your an elf then because you chose something else you miss out on some of the black smithed armor.<P>PvP, I don't know who has ever dueled outside of the arena but. Fear - causes LD you can't do anything, Charm - Causes LD you can't do anything, AE Stun - just doesn't work outside of Arena. Okay what about our debuffs and dots and DD, every lore of every fantasy pretty much says a caster at high lvl (ie 50) would wax any warrior at the same lvl easy, the exact opposite for low lvls, the caster would be dead before he even thought about casting..I don't duel much maybe cause last time i tried to fight a warrior she was 1 lvl under me and i got absolutely nothing to stick on her, i was 49 she was 48.<P>As a whole i find it quite annoying that not only do all pure casters have to get new equipment much like warriors in new places, but because we cast spells we also have to search for them off mobs, bards don't have to get their spells of mobs, granted there is only one a lvl, but still. maybe its just me on that thought though i guess i would be to powerful having my area effect lvl 55 tash so i can aggro the whole pull on me.<P>Charm, can we not get some or change the ones we have so they have a minimum time before they can break, i charmed and orc pawn in east commons with Boltrans Argacie (whatever its called) it broke 2 seconds after I cast...come on i was 54 at the time and an orc pawn is what? lvl 2?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Lack of enchanting equipment<P>The fixes as shown by the other posts are well thought up and should be implemented.<P>One other thought - the jewelry kit has 4 slots - why can't the mana vials that we can make be put in there to allow for additional mana usage; or be allowed to make rings that can cast spells like mage fire spells??<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&lt;QUOTE&gt;<BR>Keep in mind that there is nobody that knows anything about EverQuest that doesn't worry that enchanters are already overpowered, even those that play enchanters. <BR>&lt;/QUOTE&gt;<P>God I hate this attitude and I hate that Absor would perpetuate it.  Everyone wants to pay attention to the power of an enchanter, but no one is willing to consider the tradeoffs, risks, and costs that comes with the power.  <P>Let me ask you to consider some other "conventional truths" in the game:<BR>- Chanter nukes have a longer recast time on them than spells used by other casters.<BR>- Level by level chanter nukes dish out far less damage than those of other classes, doing barely more damage than clerics.<BR>- Chanter nukes carry a taunt with them that is far out of proportion to the damage they do.<BR>- Chain casting and using more spell slots than another class, chanters can't out damage any other class for nuking ability, with the possible exception of a ranger or paladin.<BR>- Chanter dot's have a dd component, which makes root break<BR>- Chanter dot's last longer than any other dot, meaning the mana efficiency of them is nothing when the average fight lasts 40 seconds.<BR>- Chanter dot's do not stack with necro DoT's<BR>- Charm breaks quickly on mobs unless they are low blues.<BR>- A broken charm is very likely to mean a dead chanter without a group to support him.<BR>- When a party member dies, it is usually the chanter<BR>- When a soloing caster dies, it is usually a chanter or a wizard.<BR>- When a chanter casts speed, he improves another class, not himself<BR>- A pet class that can't control their pet can get a cahnter killed by breaking mez<BR>- A tank that doesn't understand how to properly use /assist can get a chanter killed.<BR>- Chanters have the lowest hp, AC and defensive skills in the game - and are less likely to have items to improve defensive skills because of requirements for high cha, mr, and int to play the class effectively.<BR>- Few enchanters solo, the risks aren't worth it.<BR>- Haste makes other classes better, not the chanter.<BR>- C 2 can make the chanter better, but also makes every other caster class better.<BR>- Necros, bards and druids get forms of charm.  Necros and druid charms spells are more effecitve on their targets than the general chanter version.<BR>- Necros and bards get forms of mez.  Necro Screaming Terror can mez otherwise unmezzable mobs; it is a fear spell, not a mez spell.  Bard mez can effectively control 2 or 3 extra mobs. <BR>- Bard song mana regen is approximately 50% faster than chanter mana regen spells at similar levels of casting / singing.<BR>- A druid or Wizard can earn more money teleporting than a chanter can doing jewelcraft.  They can do so without investing 25000pp to get to 250 skill.<BR>- A Cleric can earn more money rezzing than a chanter can doing Jewelcraft.  Again, without investing 25000pp.<BR>- Jewlery can be practiced by anyone, teleporting and rezing are reserved to a few.  <BR>- Jewelry is inevitably a dying tradeskill because everything produced using it is permanent.  Shaman potions get used up, teleports will always be needed, but how many Velium Ruby Veils can you wear in a character's lifetime?<BR>- An Enchanter pet will not attack unless the chanter is attacked.  (aggro's uber mob to engage pet and dies to uber mob before pet can take a swing at said uber mob - UNLESS the mob ae's, then it must not kill the pet outright or fear it.)<BR>- Mezing a mob doesn't kill a mob.  Damage does.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A while back there was a patch that add the use of the TAB button to scroll through a stack of mobs.  This is such an AWESOME idea.  After all, mobs take up no space and can stand 5+ on top of each other.  Only thing is...this command doesnt work worth diddle.  Would be great to see this fixed, especially since in many of the newer dungeons there seems to be targetting issues.<P>Also the charm bug (IMO bug).  There is nothing worse than charming a mob to change the course of the fight and then have your pet start attacking someone in your group.  It wont back out.  You cant cast on it.  You simply have to go invis to break charm (who keeps invis memmed) or watch it smack someone around.  Instead of assisting your party you have just unleashed potential terror on your party because that mob is no longer subject to any type spell/damage.<P>Overall, Im pretty happy with the class.  New illusions would be nice.  Some benefits to having a religion would be nice..it seems more of a punishment as it is.  I would like to see more armor options.  Velious was nice for this but we still look mostly like carbon copies of one another with our steins we got at lev 12 and our drake legs from lev 30.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Another quick post as I have to run to a raid shortly however, these are my major issues as a lvl 51 enc so far.<P>*** NOTE: I only fought in SoV for a short time to get my own spells, then I left.  Take that as it may, but I didn't find it worthwhile to be there ***<P>1) Religion.  Give us religion illusions that stack with our normal ones.  This should solve alot of problems for us in quests that just are too darn hard.  Likelyhood to dieing while camping any item near my level about 5%.  Likelyhood to dieing doing a quest for my level about 400-800% or more. Yes, that's right, I die 4 to 8 times ALTEAST trying to do the simplest of quests for my level do to my religion.  Where is the balance in that?<P>2a) Spell taunt.  PLEASE reduce our spell taunts.  It sure seems out of whack with the other casters.  ESPECIALLY the tash line!  Try doing a raid, let 60 tanks go in and let it whack the mob for 1-2 minutes, then cast tash.  Whoa? I'm on the top of the aggro list????<P>2b) AC. Considering our jobs.. We get whacked WAY more than any other caster class, yet our ac is still terrible.<P>2c) Defense.  Same problem, raise our cap post-50 atleast.<P>2d) Dodge.  Cap at 75??? Why?  Fine...Atleast raise it to 200, and give us a 0.00001% chance of it raising per hit.  I'll max that out in no time ;p<P>3) Quests.  We have to do more quests for our everyday things than every other class.  Our pets, our spells, our research spells, and quest armor.  We have to travel to every zone in norrath it appears for a spell or something at one time or another.  I can see this, and I actually enjoy some of them, except when I seem to run into a problem where my religion makes the quest not just a bit harder, but to the point you actually have to get lucky just to complete it and die a ton just trying.<P>4) Sentinel.  Just get rid of it.  It would only be useful in a few minor instances if it was fixed.  As it stands, its just a huge lag creator and people annoyer.<P>5) Whirl til you twirl.  Used the spell once, never found a reason for it.  I wouldn't say take it out...It just doesn't seem to have a purpose.<P>6) Items.  Where's my uber CHA/INT items?  Mostly in the planes... Ok, I get it, not only must I group, but I need to be in a big guild too.  I had to switch guilds just because the guild I was in was never going to be planes ready.<P>7) Group clarity.  DROP THIS to level 44, PUHLEASE!  At 52, it's going to be a short lived spell since C2 comes at 54.  It would have been useful then, I just don't see me using it much after getting C2.<P>8) Color shift.  Lower the casting times on the 3rd and 4th in the line please.  Lower the cast times to 1 second across the board (The first in the line is 1 second and works great), and that'll free up a spell slot for me.  The difference between 1.0 second cast time, and 1.5 is the difference between getting it off occasionally, and not getting it off at all.<P>9) Spell slots.  I understand that it would be difficult to add another spell slot or two for enc's this late in the game but, please understand, this is a problem for us, we have more spells than any other class (see table after this), yet, we are still limited to the 8 spells slots.  And a good number of those are tied up in if-ya-wanna-live-then-mem-this-always spells, that we don't have any room to put up some of the more interesting, less used, or we land up swapping spells all the time (Normally buffs).  This is also compounded by the relatively short duration of the spells we use in every day use.  Example: Clarity - 27 minutes, Garou - 6 minutes, swift like the wind - 16 minutes, rune (Duration long, but since it falls instead of acting like a symbol, it gets recast alot), and the lesser used spells berzerker spirit - 5 minutes, our pets that are constantly dieing because they are green, couple with that the spells that have to remain up because of the extremely long cast time (And they don't 'regen' when they are down and you take the whole repop hit when you put them up) like boon of the garou, berzerker strength, theft of thought, etc.  And we're now extremely cramped for spell gems, and we're swapping the buffs in and out constantly.  The may be the vision, but the vision in this case is plain broke.  In my vision, the game was meant to be fun ABOVE ALL ELSE.  Swapping spells is NOT fun.  Possible solutions are to repop some spells while down (Probably rather difficult since the server would have to keep track of this), increase the duration of our buffs (YAY! Clarity for an hour please! sltw for 45 minutes!), or allow us to add duration to spells instead of simply overwriting (First cast lasts 30 minutes, second cast adds 20 minutes, third cast adds 14 minutes, fourth cast adds 10 minutes -- a total of 74 minutes), change the color shift line so we only need one of them up instead of the 2 I now carry at all times, OR allow us to cast directly from our spell book for a 50% cast time penalty -- we'd have to be sitting anyhow, so how would that be unbalancing?<P>Class Levels 1-12 13-29 30-49 50-60 Total<BR>Enchanter      52    60    60    39   211<BR>Magician       42    47    43    41   173<BR>Wizard         30    43    49    41   163<BR>Necromancer    42    45    40    40   167<BR>Cleric         33    49    43    37   162<BR>Shaman         31    54    50    41   176<BR>Druid          31    63    63    40   197<BR>Paladin         7    14    23    20    64<BR>Shadow Knight   7    14    23    20    64<P>Out of the INT casters, enc's have 22% more spells, yet 0% more spell gems.<P>10) Gift of Magic - Worthless.  It costs me 150 MANA to increase someones MAX mana by 50.  Assuming you give this to your cleric (Prolly the best choice), they can get off an extra one FIFTH of a superior heal.  Or I can keep the mana for myself and dazzle an extra mob. (And have 25 mana left over for a quick 4 sec ae stun).  I think the choice is obvious, and it's less of a hassle too.  A large mana pool is relatively useless anyhow, it's mana regen that counts.  Compared to the mana effectiveness of clarity (1890 mana regened over 27 minutes), its just terrible, and it's a spell five levels higher than clarity.  I don't see how you can even begin to fix this one, it will never be close to the mana efficiency as clarity unless you made some drastic changes, like make it a group spell, increase the mana pool by something noticable like 250-300, and increase mana regen by a mana/tick or two.<P>11) Skills.  Do we have ANY skills that increase post-50?  Why weren't these bumped up as well?  It sure looks to me that Kunark and especially SoV everything was given to the melees.  They deal more damage, they got much better items and equipment, they had their skills caps raised, hybrids got all that plus new spells.  Casters just got new spells that are more and more ineffective (The are more powerful but don't keep up with the MR/HP curve of the Mobs we are expected to kill).  We fizzle more, we get resisted more, more mobs are marked as unmezzable, and our spells do less % damage to total hp.  In general caster dd's need a faster recast time, we need MUCH faster regen abilities, and we need our spells skill caps raised significantly -- probably higher than is possible with the current engine.<P>12) Cons.  We need blue broken up into 2 or 3 bands of blue.  High blue, blue and low blue.  We need to know about the level of mobs with more accuracy than we currently can gather with the /con. (Low priority)<P>13) Charms - Too unreliable at low level.  We don't have 200 CHA back then.  Problematic at the high levels and eats a sorely needed spell slot.  Is it worthless? No.  Can it change the tide of a battle? Yes -- both ways, although in experience the dice are loaded against the enc.  There is always the possibility of it causing the enc to die when it breaks and it's not usually worth the risk.<P>14) Stats.  Of all the pure casters, enc's have to worry about more stats than the others.  Not only must we max int or wis, but we must also worry about CHA.  And if we don't want to get killed, we also worry about AC and AGI (To give the cleric enough time to be able to heal us - especially when we get aggroed mid CH).  Unlike the other INT casters, we're usually on our own to get the mobs off us.  The tanks can help sometimes, usually too late because of our uber taunting spells, and then when we finally can get the mob mezzed before it kills us, the tank had better be paying attention and stop attacking, or now we're really dead.<P>15) Rune.  I'm sure this is the way it envisioned the enc.  I just don't think it should be that expensive for Rune compared to it's benefits.  At best, you could consider it comparible to a heal (Assuming the one who gets runed is actually going to take that in damage), but the pp cost is just way too high.  Infact Rune 4 vs Superior Heal, we pay 10.5pp, we get a cast time 11% longer, we get worse aggro, "heals" for 48% less, you can't "heal" again until you take the damage, and we get it 5 levels after superior.  I think the cost part could be eliminated, or atleast reduced significantly (take a Jasper at the top end instead of peridots).  Even the armor with rune as a clickable effect STILL requires the component??? OUCH!<P>16) I'd love to see a jewelry craftable type of jewelry that would address OUR needs.  Mainly CHA/INT/AC.  OR CHA/INT/HP.  OR CHA/INT/AGI.<P>17) Plain lack of information.  Every other class knows pretty darn well what stat effects what.  As an enc I've been told that CHA affects a good number of our spells, yet, I've been told by others that it really hasn't much, if any, effect.  We don't know if there is any such "cap" on it like INT/WIS.  The problem is the supposid spells that rely on CHA, are just so darn erratic, that any statistical analysis is just overly long and difficult.  All I want to know is: Is there an artificial limit placed on the amount of CHA as it affects our spells??? Common sense would dictate the answer is no, but just about every stat seems to have an effective "cap" that has neither realistic nor roleplay reasoning behind it.  If there is such a cap, I don't see how we are "supposed to figure it out on our own because its part of the mystery of the game" since it's a mechanics limitation, not one that makes any other kind of sense.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>From someone who plays a DARK ELF enchanter...<P>MINOR ILLUSION<P>I recall when I could cast minor illusion on Neriak's newbie log and med in peace without another black wolf assaulting me.<P>Some patch later, I couldn't cast minor illusion on newbie log. It seemed that now I had to cast it in the middle of the zone.<P>Some levels and another patch later, certain creatures saw through my illusion. Now, it could be argued that undead can see the "heat" your body gives off in any illusion. But an orc pawn? Come on. That is one of the lowest level creatures in EC. How can an orc pawn disrupt me while a griffin flies by me? Of course, once the orc pawn starts attacking, the griffin takes notice as well. Is that the idea? If it is, why don’t you take minor illusion out? It’s been nerfed so much it’s useless to newbies.<P>GODS<P>I know DE wizards, HE enchanters, and maybe mages have Solusek Ro as a deity option. I believe enchanters who worship Solusek Ro get a special spell, or can enchant a special metal (don’t remember which). Why don’t DE enchanters have the same option?

</FONT><HR>I don't play an Enchanter any more (I started one but had too many characters to keep her up), but here are my observations from watching my brother and working with him:<P>Enchanters are very powerful, very viable, very useful characters.  An Enchanter can solo if absolutely needed, but doesn't excel at it, they excel in groups.  Every group loves an enchanter, at every level you should be grouping.  Enchanters make the party better and the monsters worse, and everyone survives more and suffers less damage with a well-played Enchanter around.<P>All that said, however I see a few little issues that could be addressed:<P>-Add in pet back off command.  Just that one command, and the class is helped out tremendously, consider it compensation for having pets weakened and other pets made more powerful.<BR>-Add in Major Illusion (random illusion of closest NPC type).  Doesn't require any new work in zones, just duplicate what's there.<BR>-Add in Enchant Weapons like this:<BR>---Enchant Weapons to proc a small effect at lowest level, growing with level.<BR>---Enchant Weapons to do slightly more damage (1 at level 16, for example, 2 at level 29, etc).<BR>-Add in spectre illusion.  Necromancers getting this and the illusionists of the game not is patently absurd.<BR>-Add in group illusions at highest level.<BR>-Look at the faction enhancing spells, something seems to have gone wrong with them.<BR>-Add in illusion: gender and Illusion: Agnostic.  If you can make someone believe a gnome is an ogre, then by all means you can make them think you are female or not a follower of Bertoxxolus.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>BOON of the GAROU : PLease leave this as is. As it is now, it lasts 5 minutes, with a 3 minute recast. That means 2 tanks can have it up at once. I really don't want to have this as a 10 minute recast with a 15 minute duration. If I cast it on the wrong person, tank dies, tank runs out of range (while casting), etc.. I will have to wait 10 more minutes. As is I use this spell all the time, and have no problems with it as is. Whom ever made the spell did a good job.<P>RESEPLENDENT ROBE : I know this isn't a 'balance' issue. Most of the Plane of Growth robe effects are nill worthless. The Enchanter robe has Effect: Rune IV with a 30 second cast time and requires a Peridot. I can not think of a good time to use this. If a melee is dying? No, 30 seconds. Just for fun? No, I would use Rune V if I wanted real protection. Rune IV is a 234mana (around that) level 44 spell.<P>Reducing the cast time to about 12 seconds, keeping the 30 second cast time without requiring a component, or putting someother effect like Gift of Insight would make the robe actually used.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&lt;Quote&gt;<BR>And this seems to be the key issue will all casters lately, with the same problems. But Enchanters have a somewhat unique problem here. Look at the spells that you want to use; charms, mez, stun… spells that completely change the combat. &lt;/Quote&gt;<P>Mezing a mob doesn't kill a mob.  Damage does.<P>Chanters don't kill mobs, the rest of their party does.  In sebilis, assuming NO RESISTS, I can keep a single jugg mez'd for about 4 minutes and then I am oom.  Add in resists and I am lucky to hold a jugg at bay for 2 minutes before OoM.  Oh, and by the way, I really love all the fun associated with dying to that same mob when mez finally breaks.  Doesn't happen all the time, but enough to be noteworthy.<P>&lt;quote&gt;<BR>Crowd control that works on an encounter that has, say, two monsters and is designed to be fought by twenty people… you'd be able to cut the encounter in half! You would, effectively, be acting as ten other characters. <BR>&lt;/quote&gt;<P>Absor, let me educate you of how this is done.  When more than one mob is un mezzable, the raid splits the extras off and either kites if practical, or has a small group tank each extra.  That small group is usually a single cleric and single warrior.  The cleric CH's and the warrior taunts and tanks.  ALL other 18 would be concentrating on the one mob.  <P>How is the chanter Cleric combo that mez/heals different from the Cleric Warrior combo that tanks/heals?  The second mob is taking damage during one and the cleric is expending mana rather than the chanter.  Also, the chanter keeps casters from healing and dies more often.  Otherwise?  No difference.<P>Two mobs that requires 20 peeps to kill is either not charmable by anything less than a 60th enchanter, or the charm will last a few seconds tops.  Level alone will preclude this from being anything more than a VERY temporary charm if not an all out resist.<P>One final note:  A good monk and pull team will seperate the mobs anyway, so what is your point?<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Now that i have though about it, DE enchanters should have a newbie quest for something. I mean, a level 1 DE enchanter doesn't have a single thing to do questwise. And very little MoB wise. It took me 2 hours to get to level 2 because the only things I could find were a few white conned spiderlings and a few white skellies. No snakes that are normally there. And for the HE enchanter. Don't you think that there newbie quest should be fixed. I mean that all of the other HE caster have a newbie quest, but NOOOO. Enchanter don't get one.

</FONT><HR>Heres my view of enchanters past 50.<P>Our DD is way too weak compared the the upgrade in damage other classes get. look at how much enchanters DD for at level 50 compared to other classes at 50: we barely do less damage then all classes except wizard, nuke alot harder then hybrids.<BR>Look at damage at 60, we do very little damage compared to most classes, melees do more damage in the same time it takes to chain cast 2 DDS using their "0 mana cost melee" and we can only test against magic resistance which is a resistance that is put on any mob which shouldnt be mesabable, slowable etc. result is that I stand around doing nothing on many encounters except pretend im a weak healer using bedlam or runes (these spells cast slower then a heal of equivalent strenght).<P>basically give us something to do when we arent mesing (prefarably not more buffs, there is only 15 buff slots)<P>make the level 55 pet more stable in levels, seems the level gap for it is huge and its extremely hard to get a blue coning pet at 55.<P>there should be a way to know when you have reached your max mana pool. I'm level 60 and have 490 mana in items(including gift of brilliance) and id like to know if I can switch some items around to get more HP gear and Ac gear (enchanters need a lot of these with the high taunt factors) because i have reached the total amount of mana I can have and im wasting mana items.<P>is the wrist item from PoG some kind of joke? I remember when a big clamour was made about enchanters not being a pet class then you put "reclaim energy" on our wrist. Not only is one of the worst effects on armour considering how useless it is and how low level it is but it is also insulting.<P>Change the code on the orginal norrath to allow mobs over 51 (or 52) to not be 100% unmesable and charm proof. A good example of this code is the Hole where mobs are immune to my crowd control just because they are over this old level limit.<P>how about making illusions give other resistances and making wolf form usuable indoors again? wolf form doesnt give any sow, you fixed the faction problem with it a long time ago (no longer beta neutral) and it has uses indoors such at the extra cold resist. Right now I can boost my fire resistance with illusion drybone and cold resist with wolf form, how about giving me forms to boost the other resistances?<P>the resistance decrease on tash should be higher. If mages get a unresistable malo which decreases all resistances by the same amount as my highest tash, my tash should give maybe -50 or -60 mr consdiering we were the only class with resistance debuffs in the beginning and these classes are borrowing our ability.<P>something drastic must be done about glamour of kintaz and rapture. Having mobs that take longer to kill, I need a mes that last longer.(this occurs up to 50 then stops) There is only 3 type of mobs that react to these spells which are meant to be a severe crowd control nerf disguised as an upgrade. Juggernaunts, myconid reavers of the highest level, myconid adepts of the highest level. Everything else that isnt mesable with dazzle is immune to mesing. either you should change these spells to either <BR>1) last longer then dazzle <BR>2) make them affect things that dont react to dazzle all the time unless they are god level mobs<BR>3) make them unresistable (rapture does not stick on 100% MR mobs)<BR>4) reduce the mana cost by at least half.<BR>also having a mob that cannot be affected by mes not super aggro on me when I find this out would be nice.<P>There should be a way of knowing if the mob im sapping mana out of has run out of mana (like a message saying that it has in red)<P>Put some ac, hp and stamina on enchanter specific items. most of the time they have very low ac (if at all) making my life very difficult.<P>since alot more classes have mem blur type spells enchanters should get a mem blur that works without costing a high amount of mana. Before 50 mem blurs work decently but after 50 they hardly work. the level 55 350 mana slow casting mem blur should be 100% unresistable for the amount of mana it cost.<P>we have two items that have a right clickable clarity 1 effect, the wand off innoruuk and the pants in plane of growth, perhaps one could be upgraded or changed.<P>the amount of taunt enchanters do on high level encouters (who quad for as much hp as I have) is insanely high and innapropriate.<P>enchanters may have an easy time to get groups in sebilis because of the way its designed but our use in raids is usually limited to buffing and watching, and outdoors no one needs us. People expect clarity 2 for free so it is not a grouping factor. In velious im twiddling my tumbs half the time or mirroring another class's abilities (pseudo healing) because my main purpose past 5<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>In your post you mentioned people complaining that Enchanters, and some other classes, are overpowered and you may have to nerf us in order to balance the classes. <P>I just wish that people would realize that a nerf to Enchanters, or any of these classes, will basically be a nerf to groups. I'm sure that if some of our abilities and effectiveness are reduced or removed they won't be given to other classes to compensate for their loss to a group.<P>What will basically happen is just a loss of the potential power of a well organised symbiotic group. And encouraging us to group and interract is something the designers have always said they are trying to achieve. As such, it seems to me, reducing the effectiveness of groups in general  is not conducive to achieving this goal. <P>Personally, I think the real crux of the matter is that some players feel that groups may tend to choose an Enchanter, or any of the godlike classes, over some other classes when forming a group and that's not fair to the other classes. <P>And while I can understand that feeling I don't believe the solution to this is to nerf Enchanters, or any other group oriented class like Clerics or Bards, so that they aren't so attractive to a group anymore. As I said, all this does is reduce the effectiveness of groups in general.<P>Actually the godlike power of the Enchanter that everyone talks about is pretty situational. If you need crowd control, you seek an Enchanter. Otherwise, Druids and Shaman have heals and SoW and tend to get chosen over an Enchanter, even considering Clarity. In a camp where crowd control isn't an issue most groups will choose a Cleric over an Enchanter. You may have a little more downtime, but you will live.<P>It's a fact that in Everquest some classes are more group oriented and group enhancing than other classes. Many people forming groups will tend to choose those classes over others. It's just the nature of the game.<P>As in: <P>Dang, I tried to get in a group in (insert dungeon or plane name here) and there was an Enchanter (or Cleric, Druid, Shaman) and I didn't have a chance. This is a bummer, they should do something about it.<P>I think that when everyone talks about balancing the classes, what they are really talking about is trying to get the classes to the point where a group won't choose one class over another simply because of their abilities and their perceived potential to enhance a group's chance of success.<P>Good luck game designers, this is going to be a monumental task.<P>Without removing these classes defining abilities completely, SoW, healing, Clarity, Manasong, Mez, I just don't see how you can do it. Groups will always want these abilities and spells available to them. And classes who have them will probably always be chosen over classes who don't.<P>I play the game for fun. I have started several characters and classes. I tend to play each of them according to the situation that exists in any given game session.<P>If I don't have friends to group with, I play one of my solo oriented characters. If my friends are online, I pull out one of my more group oriented characters.<P>I don't worry too much about balance. Early on I realized that it's hard to find a good pick-up group in this game. So I bit the bullet and started some characters that I could play effectively when I couldn't find a group. I could then still play and have fun even if I wasn't advancing my "main" character.<P>I know people have heard this over and over, but I still think it's one of the greatest features of this game, and that is:<P>You can be anything you want in Everquest. You can be an Enchanter. You can be a Cleric. You can be a Druid. You can BE any of these godlike classes you want to be.<P>To me, that is the true balance in this game. None of us as players are really denied these godlike qualities and abilities.<P>All it takes is some time and effort to build one of these characters and you can be as godlike as anyone else.<P>I realize this post doesn't address specific issues of balance concerning Enchanters, but I just wanted to point out some obvious truths about balance in this game while you are making your decisions about how you will enhance or reduce the power of Enchanters or any other class for that matter.<P>Make us better, we will love both you and the game.<P>Nerf us and we will become frustrated with both you and the game.<P>Just the nature of the beast.<P>Anyway, my two cents worth.<P>Good luck and good hunting and see you in the game!<P>Frodo</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I chose (and stuck) with Enchanter as my caster-type largely for the Illusions. I am learning crowd-control as a way to survive and gain groups, but the draw for me was the ability to cast illusions.<P>Having said that, I think I will take a radical departure from several previous illusion-based enchanters. I have a fundamental belief that the enchanter is immune to his or her illusion!  No matter what I change into, it should give /me/ no stat boosts (thus Illusion: Wolf is fine without SoW!) nor any other internal changes (such as a change in vision quality). A previous poster gave examples on how the enchanter illusions are truly transformations - I agree. I however, would prefer them simply to be illusions.  The only things that should happen when I, as an enchanter, cast an illusion are these: 1) The player skin should change to reflect the illusion chosen, and 2) factions should be readjusted for the chosen skin.  This second point does not contradict the 'no stat' request, as factions are not, in my view, an internal stat.  They are a combination of name reputation (Bob_the_Orc_Slayer kills upteen thousand orcs, people will hear about it. If they were plagued by the orcs, Bob's a hero -- if they're the orc clan he's been hunting, they hate him dearly.) and prejudices based on race, class, and belief.  Especially for the racial illusions, a change in my appearance means that the racial prejudice will change, as the NPC I talk to sees only the human enter the room, instead of a dark elf.<P>Along that line, though, it's amazing how much we underestimate the NPC's intelligence. My dark elf can walk up to a glowering merchant, get rebuffed, cast an illusion in front of the NPC's eyes, and amazingly the merchant loves me. This makes sense with a spell like alliance, which essentially makes a telepathic suggestion that my character is friendly towards the NPC's chosen faction, but not with illusions. I am leary about making a change to this yet, though. Not only would that require extra code (my suggestion would be, if there's direct Line of Sight(LoS) within the NPC's current aggro range, then no faction shifts with that NPC occur), but I firmly believe that the LoS code is broken for NPC's.  Every day, in any character, I can be attacked by an aggro mob /through the wall of a building/! Likewise, when I break an opponent's morale and they run away, the flee directive overrides terrain and wall obstacles. The obstacles block /me/ from following the mob, but do not impede the mob at all. Thus, this bug /must/ be fixed before we tackle anything regarding LoS as a trigger.<P>On the question of more / better / exclusive illusions, I follow the trend of taking away certain illusions (werewolf) from other classes to give to us solely, rather than increasing the amount of global skins to accomodate the same. I too want visible cloth armor.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Another way to increase the amount of illusions we have is to alter our DoT spells (or create a new line).  The basis of this spell would be that the enchanter illusionist creates an illusionary terrain, which the target /believes/ would harm them. Thus it is that belief that causes damage.  Examples of this could be a Bramble patch, acid rain, lava pit ('The ground beneath you turns to lava.'), etc, all of which could resist vs magic, and feed from the divination skill.  <P>My final note regards the debuffing effects we have. Here, I fall among the majority: as NPC's are coded now, they have little to no effect. To make them effective, they either need to make STR a true stat on a monster, or the de-STR buffs need to change to a percent drop in base damage instead. This latter change would have its own issues, as that requires a careful calculation so that they affect PC's in the same manner that they do currently.<P>And once, just once, I would like to see a mob start to spin when hit by 'Whirl til you Hurl'.  The spin itself is possible, I know, as mobs often do when in the middle of a morale break. As it stands, neither these nor the blindness spell seem to affect the mob's accuracy in hitting (or even deny it at all by giving them a 'You cannot see your target'. Personally, I suspect that the attack code does not check facing or sight, only distance between the X,Y coordinates of the mob and the PC target. -- Note, I didn't say Z. I've stood at the top of Blackburrow, on the edge of the pit, and been attacked by razorgills what, three floors beneath me? Amazing how the little buggers can jump 300 feet to bite someone.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Anyhow, I know I am rambling, but these are my thoughts from a mid-child (17) Enchanter.<BR>Midgarn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Background- Been playing the Enchanter class since about March after the game came out. Most of what I'd want to say has been repeated, so I'll talk about only the differences:<P>1. Life. Health. Currently we enchanters hold the least ammt. of hitpoints of any class.  At higher levels where things are harder to mez, unless a cleric is on you with heals, a failed mez attempt almost spells certain doom as most mobs 50+ can kill us within 2 rounds.<P>2. In response to the people who have made comments about the weakness/str debuff lines, look deeper as they do have visible effects on mobs.  While I would like to see an improvement of mobs actually hitting for less damage as they should be lacking the strength, starting at level 44 we enchanters can actually "snare" humaniod sized targest by stacking our weakness/incapactiation lines.  I was satisfied with that effect.<P>3. Not to over-emphasize the uselessness of Lull spells, I would suggest taking them out completely rather than trying to find ways of improving them.  At my level Enchanters shouldn't be pulling anyhow, and for controlled pulls Druids (Harmony) and Monks (FD) are better suited to do the job anyhow.  But I, too, have encountered the uselessness of a level 51 Wake of Tranquility that can't even land successfully on level 30 frogs in Guk, let alone would I ever try that spell on level 50+ mobs.<P>4. Illusions - I too believe that these should stay when zoning (for the most part). To think of the game realistically, in most cases "Zoning" involves moving from one pathway to another.  Zoning from West Freeport to East Freeport, for instance... what exactly happens within that 2 feet of ground as I turn the corner that causes me to lose my illusion? Nothing, a simple server change.  Illusions should be upgrades to act similar to invisibility type spells, they stay while you zone and don't drop until they wear off.<P>5. Unmezzable mobs - It's my humble opinion that ANY spell of ANY type that has absolutely no affect on a type of mob should not incurr the aggro of that mob.  Charms.. Mezzes, etc.  If a Giant cannot be mezzed, it means he cannot feel the effects of my spell, so why should he be upset?  For all inents and purposes I could have been casting Benevolence on them? All they know is that pretty lights surround them, but since it has done nothing adverse to them, they shouldn't care.  I don't know how many times I've lost my life learning that a certain mob that is beating on the cleric instead kills me for trying to Mez it when it cannot be.  Either prevent me from casting the spell at all, or have the spell land, give me the message that it didn't work, but don't have it aggro the mob.<P>6. In response to the Shaman that said to nerf us since Shaman are supposed to be the kings of Debuffs, you will find that most of the time the equivalent level of a shaman debuff already is better than the same level of enchanter debuff.  (Good example is the Slowing line of spells, Shaman ones are always better and override Enchanter Languid Pace/Tepid/Shiftless Deeds)<P>7. UP THE TIME of the random counters for spells like Fear, Charm to at least have SOME semblence of a "fair" minimum duration.   Every Enchanter has had the run in with the "0 second Fear" that is broken the very instant that it successfully lands.  In cases like that it should have just been resisted outright.  I realize that it works on a "per tick" basis, where every turn the monster has the ability to break the effect, but it HAS to be possible to code it such that it's unresistable (if successfully landed) for at least N seconds.  Make it 10 seconds, make it 15..  but the fears and charms that last for a half a second before being broken seem silly and unrealistic.  A final recomendation is to make that minimum charm/fear duration based on level... or charisma... or both, so as players become more powerful they feel that they can rely more on spells of that nature to save lives, or save themselves.<P>8. Personally, I would like to see more Charisma items that also boost strength. It may just be me, but I've found that my enchanter is constantly overweight and suffering because most of the Charisma items he owns grants some other stat.. agility... dexterity. Not so much important for our ability to fight, but more so we can carry more than a few daggers to make our pets dual wield (as they can not to start out with).<P>Lasombra Corazon<BR>Illumin Cathari<BR>Solusek Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor:<P>First off, as many have said, thanks for starting these threads, this is what the boards were ment for. Secondly I seem to remember you stateing that you shall be reading this during the superbowl.. well, on page 10 now, and took me over an hour to get through em all.. Relax, watch the game bud, you've earned it.<P>No doubt many of the thing's I see as balance issue's have been brought up before, perhaps with the exclusion of what I would like to see with our charms, so I shall start with that:<P><BR>1) We need a charm inbetween 53 and 60.. say a fixed duration of 3 min with a lower resist and a level cap of round 56ish, Uber mob's immune of course.<P>2) The lower level charms should be either a) refreshable while charmed (not a balence issue given the random duration of the charm itself) or ideally, after the innitial check for resist on casting, have a "minimum duration" before the mob has a chance to resist. this "minimum duration" should be relitively short at the lower levels, (say round 30 sec for the first of the series)increaseing to round 5 min or so with the 53rd level spell. After the "minimum duration" has been met, normal resist checks occur until the "maximum" duration of the spell is met.<P>3) Boon of the Garou castable upon our animations would be a great upgrade, dunno bout codeing but for those of us who do use the pet once in a while it would be nice to see.<P>4) WTYH series: all that needs to be done is set a fixed duration on it,say 6 seconds ranging through 10 seconds for the last in the line, and make it breakable only as much as root when a DD is cast. recast time's stay the same, remove the break on Any damage componant.<P>5) Stopppp the incessant pacing of the animations Please!! i dont care if they are "guarding" me, cant they do it by standing still???? If this cannot be done, then please, please, give us the /pet sit down command or /pet guard here command.Or just a simple /pet pleasestoppaceing command.<P>6) Animations should get auto dual weild at 44 and up.<P>7) Enchanters get hit as much as any tank. Increase defense skills, adding more gear just means more long camps.<P>8) MR and the liberal use of unmezzable flags in Sov.. think enough has been said on the subject.. been there twice, got frustrated,got bored, left. I play this class because it's an active one, tis one thing to have some mobs unmezzable, but whole zone's? Methinks you'll find with your polls that there is a much smaller contingent of players that spend Most of thier time in raids then there is doing a sandard 6 man group.<P>9) Bump for above on the sarnak bracer.. dont think a single one dropped before they poofed on Xogeny.<P>10) A bit of insight on the effect Charisma has on charms and mezzing would be appreciated, along with an increase on its overall effect. <P>11) Memblur line needs looking into, Reoccuring doesnt, and the 55th is already "at the back of the book" as they say. A message that tells us if the blur acctually held would be nice, blinking a few times might just mean the mob has something stuck in it's eye.<P>11) Other issue's that have been discussed over and over, more illusions, make the cripple line do more then an arguably negligent ac debuff, remove sentinal, etc.<P><BR>Much obliged for your time.<P>Valakov<BR>56th Enchanter.<BR>Xogeny.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
