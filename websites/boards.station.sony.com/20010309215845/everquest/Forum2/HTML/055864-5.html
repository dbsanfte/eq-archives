</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Quick question:  Why can't Deflux, and Vexing mordinia made irresistable?  320 damage in 3 seconds, with recover time, on trakanon, would do under 3000 damage, with refresh time.<P>On velious mobs, we'd run out of mana chain nuking, for a grand total &lt;drum roll&gt; of 5000 damage!  w00t!  That'll make the difference on a 200K+ monster   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Seriously though, as you said, the game wasn't balanced around broken lich, in the same fashion, the necro class was balanced around IRRESISTABLE taps.  Meaning, by your theory, necros are currently VERY broken and not "working as intended".<P>As for ignoring trolls, at least I'm not saying whats truely on my mind...

</FONT><HR>Currently I am a lvl 45 DE nec, I don't plan on going on any raids anytime soon, and I really don't mind being a mana battery if it will help the group.  The one thing I always have had a problem with is the darkness line of spells, in Velious it is almost silly to use these spells as they are uber-agro.  I have around 900 hps buffed, that's around 6 rounds of combat I can take against the wonderful green mobs that double hit for 100+, even less rounds if i have Call of Bones on.  Why is it that up until level 45 I have almost solely relied on Engulfing Darkness, when at 39 I received an upgrade?  Reason-Darkness is waaaaaay overresisted, and even when it isnt resisted, pet still can't out taunt the agro it creates.  The only time i use dooming darkness is on "giant" creatures that really need it, even then i like to fear the creature first...<P>And speaking of fear, why is it that my lvl 34 fear seems to last all of 1 second against mobs 10 levels lower than me?  I realize this is a powerful spell, but yesterday I swear i had to fear an elder wurm in velious 7 times in a fight that lasted all of 1.5 minutes.  Two of those fears lasted long enough to give me the "a elder shardwurm looks very afraid", the immediate next line "your fear spell has worn off".<P>Also I put this somewhere else to no avail... A few nights ago in Guk I did not get a message when my invis undead wore off, it just poofed.  No live stuff around to undo the invis, nothing on target, yet no message....   Also, why at lvl 45 do i still get invis and invis to undead that last 2 seconds?   It's silly to IU someone, have them run 2 feetm then have to run back and ask you for another....  Fix this so that is is either based on the caster's level, or their skill in divination...<P>I love the necromancer class, I agree that they are powerful, but then I also believe that all classes are powerful if played correctly.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<BR>Just want to re-iterate what several others and myself have said:<P>Lich, while it may not be working as originally intended, is not broken. It allows those of us to solo to do so efficiently, and at considerable risk (since we generally start fights at low health, a single slip up at the beginning can have severe consequences).<P>Secondly, you're talking about nerfing Lich (which is what a change would be, given that it's been 'broken' for a _long_ time, and you folks have been aware of it for an equally long time (several months in the lifespan of a game that's been out less than two years counts as a pretty long time)) to balance positive changes to necros in the high level-uber raid game.<P>This change would be extremely detrimental to the class as a whole, as you would be taking something away from necros at all levels and most would not ever see the benefits at the upper levels.<P>Mantik</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>The all day, everyday reduction in effectiveness from a lich change vs being a *tiny* bit more useful against boss mobs?  No, no, no, no, no, no.<P>How about this instead:<P>Add one or more *brand new* spells that are useful ONLY against boss mobs.  Tune them to exactly the level of damage and efficiency deemed appropriate and don't change anything else.<P>How do you make a spell only useful against boss mobs?  Gross mana inefficiency and reagent cost.  If a spell has those attributes, it will NOT affect the everyday gameplay because it's too inefficient/expensive to use except on special occasions and holidays.<P>None of the proposed changes in the original list are big things that will swing an epic encounter any easier to accomplish for the raid as a whole.  They serve simply to make the necro player "feel" better about being there.  This is a laudable goal but not at the expense of having the rest of the necro gameplay experience diminished.<P>Touching on the epic quest item...  yes, the stats, the look and the effect are not liked or worth the effort.  Can this honestly be the intended result of an EPIC item design?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor:<P>In the old thread, someone brought up the idea of a buff/nuke for necros.  It was a buff that when cast on the target (improves no stats or resists) would cause a nuke upon that charaters death.  I liked this idea for uber mobs.  One the buff wouldnt be used for everyday experience grps no one expects to die but in large raids it could be useful.<P>Also the idea of soul binding with a tank to share HP or mana pools seem interesting and had potential.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There are some great suggestions in this thread, and also some pretty unrealistic ones. One thing I don't understand is how everyone considers necros very powerful(overpowered) already. <P>May I ask, in terms of what? Soloing? Sure we're good at it, but thats what we've had to resort to becuase of the spells we've been given and the fact that nobody wants us in their groups. Those of us that prefer grouping are punished because of the necro stereotype(soloing kewl dewd). We're not the only class who can solo with ease in case you didn't notice. The only difference between us and druids/wizards is that we have our own mana regen line. And a damn good one at that. <BR>We certainly aren't overpowered in group situations. I can't speak for anyone else, but I would gladly take a HUGE hit in the soloing department in order to be more effective in a group. <P>Soloing is boring and lame. So you soloed to level 60. Congratulations. Now you'll want to take your high and mighty lev 60 butt on some uber raids won't you. But oops! While you were busy soloing and being a hermit, you never took the time to meet anyone or get affiliated with the people who lead those uber raids. You also have zero group skills, because all you know how to do is, snare, fear, dot, dot, dot, lich, sit, and repeat. So you're screwed. Time to go farm lower guk. Hope it was worth it.<P>Verant has said time and time again that this is a group-oriented game. That they've done everything possible to encourage every class to do the group thing. Well I don't know if necros just got warped and twisted along the way, but it would seem we don't fit the original Vison(tm) for the class. No big deal, its final class balancing time! Here's your chance to turn us into the class that you and all of us were intended to be. (assuming we're not there already, i hope)<P>There's several ways that this can be achieved in my opinion. Determine what it is that we're lacking, and what it is that we have too much of. Sacrafice one for the other if need be. Balance will remain the same. Realize that you can't please everyone. Some necros are more than happy to be that annoying k00l dewd fear kiting stuff until the cows come home. But from what I've seen, all of our complaints boil down to one thing. Usefulness at the highest levels of the game, in the highest level encounters of the game. This falls under the category of group friendliness since soloing uber_mob_01 is out of the question. Whether VI likes it or not, they're going to have to address that issue one way or another before anything else can be done. <P>" Do we want to make necro's more group friendly/useful(at high levels)? Yes. "<BR>" When doing so do we want to make them even better at soloing? No. "<P>So I don't see the problem here. Several of the suggestions by people in this thread could achieve this. <P>The big one..(in my opinion)<BR>1.) Making lifetaps(Deflux) unresistable(able to land at all). If VI sees necros as being nothing more than mana batteries on the uber encounters, I don't think this is an unreasonable request. The ~300 dmg that it does will do nothing more than supplement the necro's health while he's liching and dumping mana into others. And an unresistable lifetap won't increase our soloing ability much at all. Soloing = DoT's. The lifetap is too inefficient to use as a weapon.<P>2.) You could fill our spell books with some fancy new spells like group DMF, group Lich, group feign, etc. But I just can't see this being realistic. To anyone who's been suggesting ideas like this, don't hold your breath.<P>3.) Since our pets are such a major part of our class, balance them to be a just as major part of our duties on uber raids. If we're gonna sit in the back, feeding our mana to others, at least let us use our pets to deal some damage. They can't do this if they're running around screaming like a half-elf.(feared) I realize that even though they might resist the fear, the AE or ripostes will get them soon after. But hey, its better than nothin.<P>As a side note, our epic weapon should be closely looked at side-by-side with the other class' epic weapons. And I'm not talking about the looks. How is it that clerics get arguably the best spell(in the game and of their class) on their epic, enchanters get an uber buff on theirs, and necro's get the equivalent of a level 49 dot/snare spell with a higher casting time?! This effect would be useful if it was insta-cast, or at the most, 4 seconds like the lev29 spell that every necro uses on an almost daily basis. Either modify the effect, or trash it completely in favor of a new one. I LOVED the summon a no drop/no rent essence emerald idea. That would allow us to make use of 2 of our currently useless spells, our lovely rez, and as a result, making us more group friendly. <P>Anyway, think it over, talk to a GM or someone at VI(who's opinion you'll most definitely hear out and respect) who has played a necro for a long period of time just as we have and you'll see we're not just *****ing to be more powerful.<P>I guess thats all for now, I've got a few more things to mention, but i'll wait until a progress report is posted.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Thanks for the time.<P>Nagilooh Darkfaithe<BR>56th Defiler of Brell<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>re: lich, and raid stuff<P>One of the defining features of the high level necro, IMNSHO, is efficient damage, and lich is part of that.  We can't do our damage as rapidly as other classes, we aren't the best in pet damage, and our area-of-effect spells, for whatever they're worth, aren't that effective, either.   We do our damage slowly, but efficiently, with a variety of dots, and pets that aren't the best -- and certainly not at tanking -- but have a decent damage output.  Having a superior rate of mana regen fits into this well, and helps to compensate for the extra difficulties involved in using dots and pets to do your damage.  Of course, lich has its own challenges -- often I have to let my hps get below four bubbles before I cast bond of death (since it taps hps much faster than lich can eat them).  I also have to turn lich off from time to time between battles because my health is getting low, and there isn't a mob around to tap.<P>Now, we do have other abilities.  Of course, most casting classes have auxiliary abilities as well.  And the extras we get that aren't done better by other classes -- mana transfer, DMF, and corpse summoning -- are somewhat marginal in nature, especially within the context of a normal group.  Nerf lich, and you are hurting what the necromancer is best at.<P>I'm sure you can see, within this, the raid dilemma of the necromancer as well.  The thing we do best in a well-balanced group -- efficient damage -- is moot on many raids, where pets and dots are often not allowed.  Even if they are, the aforementioned problems with dot stacking, pets being feared / lost in pathing / wasted by aoes sharply reduces this power.  But, I digress.<P>In any case, if lich is going to be nerfed, I expect to see it stack with clarity 2.  Presently, lich acts as a form of mana regen in conjunction with lifetap dots, with an overall effect somewhat better than c2.  This works because bond of death taps 720 hps for 360 mana; you get 720 mana, and spend half of it for bond.  If lich converted at a 3:2 ratio, as you say was intended, you would get 480 mana for those 720 hps tapped.  Since you had to spend 360 mana for bond, your net change in mana would be 120, instead of the previous 360 -- which would make lich vastly inferior to c2.<P>Of course, this assumes you are using bond of death (or its upgrade).  If you are on a raid that doesn't allow dots, and are using deflux to tap, you are tapping roughly 300 hps for 200 mana.  With a 3:2 ratio on lich, you would receive 200 mana for those hps tapped -- no net mana regen at all.<P>But you say, lich is a conversion spell, not meant for generic mana regen.  If that is to be the case, then I shouldn't have to give up a mana regen spell in order to use it.  The overall effect would not give necros with a nerfed lich much more mana the way it would if our present lich stacked with clarity 2.<P>I understand you want to keep the classes in balance, but please consider the effects that your proposed change to lich will have.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Briefly...please do not consider a change to Lich as being an option here.  Necromancers have been dropping like flies under the current "balance" improving Tap resist rates at the cost of a Lich line used by all players sub 55 is unacceptable.  I think it would be better to simply say that Necromancer are not really viable past 55 and end it there.  Just my 2cents on that subject and now for the main point of this post; please, I implore you, take a moment to respond to the new items from the summary below.<P><BR>=== SUMMARY #3 ===<P>ABSOR,<P>I have read through the entire thread and have compiled a summary that you might find useful. I will try and add to it if something new is brought<BR>up. Please note, the vast majority of the ideas below are NOT mine but rather those of the community at large. I am merely the editor and<BR>compiler with one exception.<P>Changes fall within several categories<P>Lifetap<BR>1. If a tap is cast on a mob that is less than six levels above the player, then the tap will check resistance as normal, but always return the full<BR>amount of health of the spell to the necromancer even if resisted.<P>2. Really a corollary to the above in that it allows partial damage while still returning full health of the spell to the necromancer.<P>2b. Makes Taps irresistable, but nerfs ToN with an increase in recast time.<P>Fear<BR>3. Provide a fear protection line that allows the necromancer to make the target immune from fear for a time.<P>4. Group fear protection--similar to above, perhaps an upgrade if a line is considered.<P>5. AoE fear removal spell which would encourage the necromancer to meditate near the fray and cast this spell somewhat regularly to keep all<BR>players and pets on target. This spell would need both fast cast and recast times to be effective.<P>6. MOB fear elimination spell which, when cast on a critter would prevent it from casting AoE fear for the duration.<P>Pets<BR>7. Make undead pets immune to AoE fear<P>8. Additional control commands<BR>a) /no attack--pet will not defend itself<BR>b) /sever--kills pet regardless of distance<BR>c) /one target--prevents pet from changing targets unless countermanded<BR>d) Slight modification to /pet report health in that the health is reported in the default channel so group or bystanders can hear. Helps clerics<BR>out.<P>9. Raid-Pets: Max pet per summon, but have very slow movement rates, are immune to fear, and suicide after MOB is killed<P><BR>General Grouping<BR>10 Ignite Bones--Remove skeleton illusion in favor of a fiery particle effect<P>11.

I think the general consensus from both necros and non was that this would be interesting to try out on test to see how<BR>it worked. Some thought it would get more folks killed than it saved. Given the supposed ease to code, it might be worth a test. My personal<BR>note is that the spell would probably need to be all-or-nothing based on the necromancer's save.<BR>13b. Less dramatic but still quite useful would be a targeted feign death spell, but only single targeted.<P>14. Mana-Link--a link similary to shifting site, but cancelable, that allows 80% of the necromancer's mana to immediately channel to the target<BR>along with 80% of all mana gained during the duration of the spell. This spell should probably have a relatively long duration, 2-3 mins, but also a<BR>very long recast time like 30 mins. Part of the compensation for this restriction should be a better ratio, perhaps 2-1.<P>15. Lower level requirement for Conjure Corpse from 57 to 55. Reasoning behind this from the poster is three-fold:<BR>a) Summoning corpses is unarguably one of the few things necros do on raids.<P>b) Summon Corpse was gained 19 levels before, which is a very long time to wait for an upgrade<P>c) Shadow Knights have gotten Summon Corpse at lvl 50 and are far better equiped to carry the heavy coffins than are necromancers.<BR>Generally speaking, hybrids do not get a parent class spell until the parent class gets any available upgrades. At lvl 55, necromancers are still 5<BR>lvls above the point where their child class gets the upgrade.<P>This situation is even more odd with respect to the improved feign death.  What is the logic for SKs getting this spell and not Necromancers, especially in Velious where mobs almost always hit you after feign.<P>=== End Summary ===<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The only changes that i think need to be made are to make a lot of our self only spells more group friendly.  They say that they want us to group, but almost all of our buffs are self only.  Gather Shadows, Grim Aura, Banshee Aura, Breath of the Dead(I know there is DMF), and etc should all be castable on group members.   Another change is to maybe make an upgrade to Spirit Armor as well.  Why we get that one version and no other upgrade confuses me.  Finally, as some people had mentioned a Feign death spell that can be cast on group members.  It might take a lot of mana, and will have rez effects when the person finally gets up, but it will save the persons life.  We are the masters of the dead and this is skill that necromancer should be able to cast.<P><BR>Thanks,<BR>Kankili Mortibus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First. <P>Ignite Bones. Beyond taking the skeleton illusion from this spell you mention preventing it from being able to be chain casted. PLEASE PLEASE  PLEASE make it have a longer refresh time opposed to having to wait for effects to where off. WHY? SO MORE THAN 1 NECRO CAN CAST IT ON A RAID. The answer to a necros question to a raid leader of, You have room for a necro? Shouldnt be, No we already have 1. You can never have enuff wizards or clerics or many other classes on a raid, why should there be a limit to necros wanted on a raid? Remove the effects, they dont make a difference anyways.<P>Second<BR>Remove the night only part of our spells, I wont even mem Quivering Veil. Levent shouldnt be night only.<P>Third<BR>Essence Emeralds. I think it has been well stated that people dont have a problem with using this component for Convergence, I know I dont. BUt I have never, nor will I ever mem Infusion or any other spell using this component. Too Expensive.<P>Fourth.<BR>Necros are damage dealers. Please do not insult this class by making us change our roles post 55 on Epic Encounters. Its a slap in the face for the hard work someone put into a character. I do not want to be a farkin mana battery. Where did it say in the necro description when I was level 1 that I was a mana battery. It says I am the dealer of death.<P>Fifth<BR>Lifetaps should land on any and every MOB. Im not saying everytime but quite often. Give us a Lure type lifetap if you must. <P>Sixth<BR>I know you dont want to talk about it but too bad. I pay my ten bucks a month so I am going to say it. OUR EPIC WEAPON BLOWS. It looks lame and the effect leaves much to be desired. The quest is too hard for the reward. There is only 1 necro epic on Prexus. Warriors need Dragon scales. They gather a raid and whack a draong to get his scale. Necros have to go on a raid and clear Fear or Hate to get a shot at Cazic or Inny and hope they drop their quest item. Cloak of Spiroc Feathers. YOu have to spent a ton of time in Air to get. The Cloak piece is very rare so its multiple trips. The Herablist rarely drops his piece. *** why make it such a pain in the ass to get for such a crummy item?<P>Seventh<BR>After 55 levels I think necros have earned the right to be more group friendly. Group DMF hurts no one. A group buff and a MOB debuff that actually makes a difference should be added. Screw soloing I hate it, its boring cause there are no good places to solo. You made this a group friendly game, well throw us a frickin bone and make us desireable. You made this a tank/cleric/enchanter game. Where is the class balance in that?<P>Post 55 is about raiding. Its all about killing the Boss or Uber Mobs. Once again I say necros are damage dealers. I have never landed Splurt on an Uber Mob. Even if I did that means another necro cannot. Thats a big reason lifetaps should be allowed to hit. So more necros can participate in an epic encounter. If you are going to screw us and make us lame ass mana batteries on these encounters, them for gods sake make us efficient at it. We are far from efficient now. The spells that you gave mages on Test have potential. Necro pets should be resistant to Fear naturally. If necro pets are immune to Fear and all the player characters are feared it leaves the pets there beating on the mob. Thats fine, its not like a necro pet is going to tank a dragon very long.<P>I would also like an improved FD. No reason we should have this. You gave away Summon Corpse to the Shadow Knights. One trait that made us unique is gone.<P>There are 2 level 60 necros on prexus compared to about 15 clerics, 15 enchanters and several others class that have atleast 10. Why do you think that is? We need to be able to offer more in a group setting and on Epic Encounters.<P>Friday night on Prexus:<P>/who all necro 55 60<BR>8:00pm EST = 5<BR>10:00pm EST = 7<BR>12:00am EST = 7<BR>2:00am EST = 3<P>I am glad you opened this thread but I am very skeptical it will lead to anything positive being we just wasted a month on the previous Necro on Epic Encounter thread.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You have a good summary there.<P>I'm not at all concerned by the transfer rate of the Subversion line.  Most necros I know, myself included, have Alteration as their specialization which makes a noticeable difference at the level you actually use this (I don't think I used it until 44+ at which point specialization has reached 200)  I am almost certain that I attain better than 2:1 transfer rates, probably nearing 1.5:1.<P>The only thing I can complain about is this:  You say we are a very soloable class, that is in fact our strength and the reason we don't have alot of group-friendly abilities.  Yet once we hit the mid 50 range we have very few places where we can effectively solo.  So we then must turn our efforts to grouping and in so doing we hope to get in on the big Bosses as well and do more than wait until a raid is over so we can feed mana to clerics for Rez'es.<P>Well ok I lied.  Second thing:  our epic.  Behind Mages it has to be the most difficult to get simply due to the rarity of items needed for the Spiroc Feather Cloak (PoA quest).  Why would I want to spend ridiculous amounts of time trying to get this when the effect is pretty crappy?  I don't mind the looks at all but the casting time is horrendous.  It means we *still* have to mem our level 29 Dark (which most necros use all the way to 60 due to casting time)  Do clerics ever have to mem a rez spell again?  No.  Mages need to mem a pet spell again?  No.  Enchaters ever need to mem a haste spell again?  No.  get my point?  It's not *epic*, plain and simple.<P>Thanks for the time</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I see too mnay classes flying arund the world with their ports or because their class puts them and porters in groups frequently. Give us a port for nec's only , make it at night or to a spot outside of towns , make it single only we don't want it to turn into an airline service. the druids and wizzies have that market cornered. <BR> Second give us a better Screaming terror. breaking spawns later to solo require a large amount oif magic and a lil luck, also a few spell slots (i.e. root series mez series darkness series, maybe an evac spell gate feign death). those slots add up and require us to limit our other spell slots.<BR> Third change the essence emeralds their only useful purpose is for rez's and the idea of asking a lvl 44+ to die so u can get one is absurd.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>     The problems with necros all started after the last major pet nerf (nerf for necros, it was a boost for mages).  In order to compensate, several spells were added to necros to try to balance them back out.  This was a big mistake.  The spells that were added were the scent line and the mana transfer spells.<P>     Get rid of both of these spell lines.<P>     Get rid of em!  Debuffing mobs and transfering mana are not what necros do!  These spells just serve to further blur the lines of destinction between the classes.  No one wants that, not the necros, and not the classes who's toes we now step on.  Furthermore, these spells also serve to confuse what a necro's role is.<P>     We were given these spells to not only balance us back out, but also to make us a bit more group friendly.  If you want to make us group friendly, then make us group friendly by doing what we were designed to do --&gt; damage mobs.  Just like we used to before the pet nerf.<P>     Defoliation, get rid of that too.  We don't need it, never wanted it.  It's not like it's a line of spells causing trouble, it's a single spell!  Get rid of it, problem solved.<P>     The AoE line of spells, get rid of that too.  I know we have had these from day one, but they are yet more spells that blur class lines.  Necros should have no AoE spells.<P>     Necros need to be restored to what 'The Vision' originally had in mind for us.  We were not meant to transfer mana, debuff mobs, cast AoE spells, or kill plants.  We WERE designed to be a outcast spellcasters (bad faction), who's spells are selfishly designed (self only buffs in almost all cases), who is good at soloing (fast mana regen, high damage output but at a slow pace, decent mob control though darkness/fear/root, with pets), and has mastery over the undead (self explanatory).  The purpose of this thread is to balance us.  Put us back to what we were originally designed to do, and we will automatically be balanced.<P>     Other classes shouldn't want a necro in their group because of our debuffs, mana transfer, ect.  Necros should be wanted in groups because we are good at doing massive damage to a single mob, and good at dealing with the undead.<P>Balance Summary:<P> (-) Remove debuff (Scent) line of spells<P> (-) Remove all mana transfer spells<P> (-) Remove all AoE spells<P> (-) Remove plant spell<P> (+) Increase overall power of pets post 50<P> (+) Allow all offensive necro spells to land normally against all mobs (even Uber mobs)<P>    Two last things, if you do the things listed above, there will be no reason to mess with the Lich line, as it would only be affecting the necro himself, so leave it be.  Also get rid of the nightime only restriction on the three spells that have it.  These spells are not powerful, and this restriction only takes away from the fun factor of these spells, nothing more.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Please change what we are.  We did not become Necros to be mana pumps.  What happened to the controllers of the undead?  Since when are Necros supposed to be a cleric for mana?  Well, since EQ I guess.  I don't know if there is much that can be done right now since the Necro wasn't really thought out in this game (speaking of raids and boss mobs).<P><BR>READ<BR>I would gladly trade my "producing mana" spells for a Poison-based DD that hits a mob boss.  This spell would be far less than a wiz or even a mags DD.  So why would anyon pick a necro over another wiz or mag?   Because then we will also have a spell that does DoT that can stack on a boss mob.  Think about it.  It makes sense.  Necros would be able to do less damage than wiz and mag but enough to contribute effectivly to a group.  If you don't want to make these changes because it would make the necro solo easier, than make the spells only work on mob bosses.  You did it with plant only, so I'm sure that you could do it with boss only too.  psssssst /whispers *our EW sucks heh heh*<P>What does someone else think?  Would you trade in our mana abilities to become an offensive contributor during a raid?  If not, why?

However, if you cast the heart line first, splurt gets the this spell does not take hold message.

I think giving a level 60 spell to ANY class that is only used for the "coolness" factor is not appropriate.<P>6)The level 55 chill bones does only 10 damage more than the level 44 spell. I'm not asking much but how bout if it does 50-100damage more? I don't think that is too unbalancing for a spell received 11 levels later.<P>7)There seems to be some level 59-60 spells that are insanely rare compared to other spells for all classes.

Now, on many mobs, Especially and most notably the Big Game and Vellious Mobs, it is just plain resisted.  I suggest making all 44+ lifetaps their old unresistable selves, or else revisit the spell line with a more balanced Mana/Damage ratio.  We are paying for a benefit that we no longer recieve, and that is just unfair.<P>2. Grouping Spells-  Very few DD's, and in a good group, nothing lives long enough to really DoT, and pets tend to wander off the second you Glance over to get a drink from the side of the Desk.  Screaming Terror was one good one, and Chill/Ignite Bones Helps.  Fixing Lifetaps so we could reliably do damage would help, though not a major concern outside of the Big Game hunt.  I would propose a Spell with a similar effect to Mark of Karn.  You have to Admit, the effect really belongs to Necromancers before it belongs to Clerics--What with having to Strike something to heal yourself.  <P>3. Esscence Emeralds- It has been said before, and must be said again, the only reasonable spell for this is the Resurrection.  Even at that, Clerics, the other class to get this effect can do it with NO reagent, much less one costing someone 4 hours of time.  Time Spent is the only thing in the entire game of any true RL value, and it is this most precious of Coin that we are expected to pay for our magic.  The spells that require it should be all but outright unbalancing. I would suggest changing the nature of the Sacrifice Spell to a DD that requires Emeralds as a Reagent and is resisted like lifetaps, but with a fair Mana/Damage ratio. Give each casting a % chance to form an Esscence Emerald.  Then the cost goes from unbearable to merely astronomical.  Why are we Sacrificing our friends anyway?  I would think that our enemies are targeted for Sacrifice way before a useful ally.  If the Sacrifice spell were Balanced to reflect the same kind of costs that other classes must pay, It would be a cool line of spells to develop in the future, and would see use.<P>4.Limitatins on spells to make them Useless.  The level 60 lifetap, not only does it take the incredibly valuble Esscence Emerald, but has a Recast of 10 minutes.  The Harmshield Upgrade, and the Evac wannabe, only at night.  Cool Idea, but need to be much more powerfull, Such as removing the Recast on the Quivering Veil, or at least reducing it to under a minute. <P>5. Recast Timers- This actually effects all of the casting classes.  Is it at all possible to track a Recast timer in the book, rather than the spell slot?  For instance- There are only 8 Slots. I Memorize Harmshield, but must now wait for the full recast time before that slot is available.  Once used, I either have to get rid of it to Mem a usefull spell, or have a Wasted Slot for the entire recast. It would be nice if the Timer tracked in the book, so that if I have not recently cast a Long recast Spell, it is instantly available.  For me, this is especially a concern with my Healing spell, which normally I do not Mem as I am not a Healer.  But on occasion for Bad pulls or similar emergency, I need it now, and I have to wait through the substancial recast.  Also with the Pet buffs.  Be nice to Free up that slot, instead of having to wait for the gem to clear up. Just a thought and I do not want to allow abuse by Casting Harmshield, Forgetting it, and rememing ready to go.<P>Thanks for your time,<P>--Necridious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I will repeat a number of things, but some bear repeating.<BR>1) Ignite/chill bones skeleton. every necro is told never to use on major raids due to reducing the meelee radius and the skellie effect. It also hurts that while the skellie illusion is on that no toerh necro can land it. No other caster has a  DD spell with this drawback.<BR>2)DOTs causing corpses to poof. Please fix this, this is the forte of Necros (and shaman) and it is  essentially taken away from us on major raids. This should not be considered an enhancement, but a  fix to a game bug.<BR>3)Nightime only spells. why??? it makes sense to load up a spell that could save your life and have it not work half the time. Why would I ever use it over Harmshield.<BR>4) Summon corpse.  No other class in the game has to kill a rare mob to get a regular spell. My guild and I have hunted ishva Mal 3 different nights for over 10 hours and never seen him. 160PP cost is prohibitive enough, plus the fact the coffins take up so much space, plus they can only be bought in one place -did you have to make it so this spell was so darned hard to get. The only way  they could have made it worse was to make the mob that drops it also be hunted by another class for their epic making it almost impossible for a necro  to get this spell if not in a major guild...OOPS.<BR>5)Essence emeralds -bump on needing these for the level 60 lifetap and infusion. The extremely long delay is good enough to never mem this spell.<BR>6)Lifetap resist at higher level. Bump on whats been stated 25 times already.<BR>7) Corpal empathy -I already give up Hps for this spell, why the huge mana cost? There's a 9 second recast, so its not like we can't even heal as good as a level 39 ranger over a 10 second period. <BR>8) Area of effect spells - a money sink for those foolish enough to fill out thier spell book. <P><BR>Some areas where I disagree with my necro brethren. <BR>1)unfearable pets - undead can be feared, uber mobs should be able to fear them as well. The mage pets should not have gotten this, but repeating a mistake doesnt fix it.<BR>2)mana battery conversion rates - it doesnt need to be 1 for 1. The fact that I can give to a cleric to heal or a wizzie to nuke offers some advantage. <BR>3)group FD- Bad idea. Now everyone and their mothers are FD pullers. Nope, bad idea.<BR>4)targeting Gather shadows and shadow sight - Necros are a selfish class, its  a pain to not be able to target friends, but it does make sense. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Why even build our hopes up?<P>I know that is not gonna change, so I resign myself to being a mana battery now.  For that, I need lifetaps to get my hp back and therefore get my mana back to transfer.  How can I do that if lifetap can't stick on the mobs I am facing?<P>Just fix lifetap and maybe a few of the other things and I will feel much better about continuing my necro post 50 or just claim that I don't have Kunark yet when I hit 50 and stop leveling to play my warrior or cleric so I can make some friends or keep playing with all the ones I have now?  Isn't a MMORPG is for the social aspect, at least partially?  Why be excluded simply because VI doesn't think letting an extremely mana inefficient spell stick on some mobs?<P>Well, thank you for reading this post (I hope) and at least putting this on your fabled list (I hope)<P>Let the flames continue, I am not gonna interfere and probably won't even check back.<P>Thank you</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>To an extent I can kinda see what you are saying. Over efficiency is bad. Free mana is bad, as is free heals. The thing is, with the Lich line of spells, mana is not free. It comes at a cost of hit points each tick. Even Clarity is not free, it has the cost of an Enchanter using his mana to cast it on you. In a way though, if you wanted to get technical, mana and health are free, and do come out of thin air. If you sit long enough, you will regen hit points and mana both. Yes, its much slower, and so this all boils down to efficiency. <P> If something is too efficient, then it makes the situation too easy. If something is greatly inefficient, the situation breaks down somewhere and the goal is either lost, or it takes twice as long. <P>Just some items that increase efficiency:<P>For mana regen:<BR>-Manastone<BR>-Manarobe<BR>-Clarity stick<BR>-Mod rods<BR>-Sceptre given in MM for Necro Quest(currently broken, has 1 charge of Clarity II, wont right click, cant hold it either)<BR>There may be more, this is off the top of my head.<P>For Health regen:<BR>Fungi tunic<BR>Fungus spores<BR>Donals BP<BR>PoG Cleric BPs<BR>Singing Steel BP<BR>Iksar BP<BR>I know theres more but I cant think of them atm.<P>These are items. There are a few such as mod rods and manastones that do have a cost to them, being the loss of HPs to gain mana.<P>The list of spells for such effects would be too long to list. My point here is that there are things in the game that do create HPs and Mana from thin air. Some do it very well, some not so well. The ability to turn HPs into Mana isnt a freebie, it can kill you if youre not watching, and the risk of death is greater in combat due to the leeching of HPs and the combined damage from the mob. <P>So to sum it up, I dont believe that the Lich series combined with the Subversion series produces free mana out of thin air. Efficiency is the key here and I feel that by upping the mana given out with Subversion in no way lessens the threat of death by using the Lich series. <P>By the way, Clarity II rocks. If there was ever a free mana spell, this one is it. Dont nerf it though. heh heh</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

If doing a see-through type of undead, its original model can still remaind the same, therefore keeping the target the same size but full-fill the need of turning the mob into a undead. Now, maybe you can change the name Ignite Bones to Ignite undead? If you think the skeleton form is cool, then I tell you I see more skeletons than anyother class because my pet is a skeleton.<P>Now solutions to already see-through mobs and skeletons.

</FONT><HR>Ok, second post, forgot to mention spells....<P>First off AOE "soul" spells... would be better if it were targeted AOE and not self aoe, the only thing these are good for is gaining faction off greens, or bonechips off skeles.<P>Defoliation-remove it, but imp defoliate lvl 29 spell and make it sold/quested, not researched or dropped.  At 29 at least you can fight treants with it, also suculants in OT (not sure they are considered plants, should be).  There are no mobs that we need to use defoliation for, it's useless.<P>Banshee Aura- why is this a 1 pt damage shield at lvl 16?  Unless this has been changed since I was 16, this spell is utterly useless at low levels, a druid shield at 16 is 6pts, move it to at least that...  Also make it self/pet only, people may actually use it then.<P>Conjure corpse- if these are smaller, stackable coffins, why do they weigh the same as the big, unstackable ones?<P>Demi-Lich / Arch Lich-  Ok who was thinking when velious came out?  Why the hell do we have 2 spells that do the same thing at the same level? Duh!?  Move one of these to 53 or 54... makes no sense to have 2 of the same spells otherwise.<P>I don't play many other classes, so here is my question... Are there any other classes that have day only spells?  I haven't heard of any!  I like the idea, really i do, but it could be imp'd better.  These spells should work during the day, albeit possibly less effective, but they should still work.  Make it so the spells are harder to save at night, therefore do more damage, otherwise that is another wasted spell slot.<P>EE's...*sigh* to confirm what every1 else has stated, EE's should only be used for REZ, PERIOD!  This is the only thing that makes sense.  I do understand that these other spells should require an item to work, but EE's are not the answer, I'd even settle for using Fire Opals.<P>Aalavar's .02 worth</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OK.  Necros have issues with being needed/wanted in groups, especially in raids.  Verant's "vision" is that people should group, and they have designed level 50+ Mobs and situations to force people to group, even necros.  However, Verant doesn't want to give necros enhancements that will increase their ability to solo.  I think we all agree that a necro is among the poorest choice of class for a raid or high level group, as what they do best, Pet, DOT, Fear, are tactics that for one reason or another have serious drawbacks against an uber-MOB, or in high level dungeons.  That said, what could be done to improve a necro's group desirabilty, without adding soloing capability?  Why not extend the necro's native forte of manipulating and converting forces (e.g. mana, HPs, and to a lesser extent XP) to include the group, and perhaps into areas not yet tapped.  The guiding theme behind these new spells would be that they don't help soloing, and that whatever you give to the group comes from either the mob, or yourself, and is of short duration, like our current Vampiric Curse line.  Examples would be:<P>Mana DOT - takes xx mana over xx seconds from mob and splits among all casters in group.  Stacks with clarity, but not with Lich (to avoid soloing improvement).<P>Haste Curse.  - Lowers attack speed of mob, and increases haste of all tanks in group.  Lasts 45 seconds or so.  Stacks with haste items and buffs.<P>Stamina DOT.  -  takes xx stamina over xx seconds from mob and splits it among all tanks in group.<P>Snare Curse.  -  lowers mob running speed for xx seconds and increases group running speed for same amount.  Works only in dungeons to avoid being abused soloing outside.  Primarily an escape spell, as you don't otherwise need to run fast in a dungeon unless you are trying to get away.<P>Targeted Feign Death.  - Save cleric on raids gone bad.  Downside, maybe necro stunned for xx seconds afterwards so he can't chain cast it, and to give mob a chance to kill necro instead of target.<P>Resist Curse (one spell for each resist type).  Mob resist to xxxxxx lowered and group resist to xxxxxx raised.  Lasts 45 seconds.  Stacks with other resist spells.<P>You could take this philosophy and extend it to any attribute in the game (e.g. strength, AGI, INT, WIS, etc.).  This would help out the group a lot without infringing on the other buffer's abilities, as theirs doesn't need a mob, and lasts much longer.  It also wouldn't have a significant effect with regard to soloing capability.  <P><BR>Just my two cents worth.  <P>Dirtbasw Cryptkeep<BR>53 Heretic - Brell<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I've played a lot of classes. Almost all of them, actually, except the mage and wizard. I like my necro because a necro is like one of those weird medical instruments on the doctor's table. You're sort of afraid to ask what it does. It isn't obvious. Warriors tank. Duh. Enchanters do crowd control and buff/debuff. Duh. Wizards nuke. Duh. It's fairly obvious from the get-go what they do, and they keep getting better at it throughout the game. <P>We're a twisted take on a lot of mismatched abilities. By accident or design, we came out being, or at least perceived as being, -the- solo class in the game, because we had most of the mechanisms for avoiding damage and some damn nasty DoTs. Being a grouping necro is -HARD-, because 98% of spells are either self-only or have a time-delay element that makes them undesirable in group combat (and I'm ignoring all the bugs in the game, like corpse vanishing here), and frankly that's why necros don't group very much, not because they are good at soloing. I've soloed as every class I've played, including clerics and enchanters. It takes more effort because the risk/reward ratio is different, but just because necros are one of the three classes with a generally good soloing outlook doesn't mean they should be the -only- class that gets virtually no incentive to group.<P>What grouping abilities we do have need to be used in weird ways to be effective. We have to selectively use our pet and DoTs and fear in surgical strikes against mobs, and we can be a backup cleric/enchanter/tank/nuker in a pinch, for a very short period of time, at a very high relative cost.<P>If VI wants necros to solo less, they should give us more to do in a group than to think up bizarre tactics involving multi-fear kiting mobs off the enchanters and clerics in tight spots, which is what I find myself doing most of time. I'm a grouping necro. I group for fun. exp is just a side effect of that. And if I do say so myself, I'm a damn good grouping necro, and my regular<BR>groupmates seem to think so too.<P>Things I would like to see for necros:<P><BR>An upgrade to Screaming Terror at higher levels. Either an AoE screaming terror or an equivalent to enthrall. Numbing Terror or whatever. 44 would be a good level for it.<P>AoEs in general. We get one that I have ever cast, and that was infectious cloud, and not because it was an AOE. The enfeeblement and word lines are so specialized I didn't even bother getting most of them. I think I may have cast Word once or twice when I wanted some bonechips real quick and decided to walk into a bunch of skeletons 40 levels below me.<P>An undead equivalent to the druid Harmony spell.<BR>Cost a bonechip or two is fine, as an upgrade to <BR>the Rest the Dead ones, which I never cast because I'm not going to waste 10 bonechips to break up a spawn of skeletons that might give me 5.<P>A targetable invis at higher levels. Seriously, there is no reason to make invis self-only at level 30+ anymore.<P>A targetable vampiric curse at higher levels, maybe high 20s or 30s.<P>Group DMF? Maybe, I like the idea, but it's not on my hotlist. What I would like is pre-DMF spells. Ie -- level 24 Dead Man Seeing: see invis, +20 resist poison, enduring breath, 20 minute duration.<P>34 Dead man Walking:  +40 vs poison, enduring breath, 40 minute duration<P>I think it would also be neat if while "dead" you didn't consume food or water, as we're the only casting class I can think of that can't summon food and water somehow or easily go somewhere to get more (wiz and enc can't summon, but they can port/illusion). Obviously the duration times would<BR>need to be played with, I'm just pulling numbers out of my necro-butt reasonably relative to DMF.<P>Further upgrades to Shock of Poison. ignite/chill bones isn't a DD, it's a quick DOT. Treat it as such as give us a real DD, even if it's the relatively inefficient Shock of Poison line.<P><BR>If making lifetaps unresistable outside of level considerations is too much, at least make them hit with partial resists. Really now, what percent of a Dragon or God's HP are we actually taking? 2%? Maybe 3%? How much damage do the 49-53 wizard spells do again? What's the damage output of modern level 50 warrior in the time it takes Bond of Death to complete?<P>Eliminate essence emeralds. Make spells that take them cost experience. Every other necro spell is a tradeoff - we lose something and gain something else in return. I'd much rather have an exp res that cost -ME- 1/2 or 1/4 a death than an exp res that cost's someone else a full death. I can justify 4 hours of my time in exchange for a res or a emergency spell, but I'm not going to ask my friends or guildmates to give up exp they may take real-life days or weeks to get back. If I lose the exp, I can at least make the cost/benefit judgement myself instead of waiting for someone<BR>to give up on the game or a character so I can sacrifice them 40 times in a row.<P>On that note, how about TPs that cost experience? Give us more dimensions to make our cost/benefit tradeoffs in. If necros are such good soloers, I would not mind paying 1/5 or 1/8 of a death at the spell level to do a teleport to an undead ruin or necro guild.<P>Give us an unresistable lifetap again. Make it cost exp for all I care. Big raids are basically  players trading exp for items anyway. Give me a better way to do it than by being the unlucky SOB who draws the short straw and gets to absorb a deathtouch or pull that supernasty mob that tends to kill the first person it sees in half a second.<P><BR>And I realize you're never go to give us an epic weapon worth getting, but I have to ask, *** were they thinking when they came up with the duck staff? I mean, really, that just sucks so much I'm suprised ANYONE has gotten it after the first player who completed the quest and tested the effect. I'm not about to ask 40 people to waste days of their lives getting me an item that is next to useless.<P>Anyway, that's my 2cp on making necros "more balanced," or should I say, more conducive to letting players, and not just the necros, have more fun playing the game. It's kind of sad that the general consensus on necros is that "They are fun until level 51."<P>There is nothing less fun than playing a character that cannot self-actualize. No one wants to be a mercy friend to the classes that got something besides the shaft with the expansions.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My comments, after sorting out what I recall already seeing in the thread (and pretty much agreeing with):<P>While it would be nice if our pets were generally immune to fear, the high-end problems would be helped if only the Emissary of Thule were naturally immune to fear.  And, given the name, that would make sense.<P>The too-high-a-cost problem of the "other two" Essense Emerald spells, Trucidation and Infusion, would be solved if the spells only required the Essense Emerald but didn't consume it (like the pearl for Banshee Aura).  Consuming the trapped soul for a resurrection makes sense.<P>I like the night-only concept for some spells (although I don't disagree with the previous comments).  Perhaps this would be an appropriate tweak for Trepidation - night only, but much longer duration and/or lower resistance check.<P>It's been referenced but not mentioned specifically - a necromantic version of the 39th level magician Test spell "Summon Companion" would be a welcome addition.  "Call of the Dead"?<P>Perhaps Arch Lich would be more servicable if the "See Invisible" bonus were replaced with something else with a specific use.  Or changed from a mana-conversion spell (no need for two at 60) to something totally different - area effect fear immunity for group, area effect lifetap DoT (to help recover after using Demi Lich since they wouldn't stack), something.<P>The sister-spell to Ignite/Chill Bones that caused ghosting (transparency) rather than skeletalization could be called "Foot in the Grave".<P>In many ways, the necromancer plays the role of evil cleric, tied to our gods as we are.  Consider letting us imbue gems appropriate to our evil gods.<P>An area effect fear wouldn't be out of place for the necromancer, even if only against undead.<P>Thanks again for taking the time to go through all of this!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I appreciate you responding to my remark about Magicians getting a fear resist for their pets and nothing for us yet.  I understand that this is on test and not live yet, but why hasnt this been given to necros on test?  What would be the reason for not giving it to us?<P>I wish you would have responded to my question on what kind of class we are.<BR>I think that determination could point in the direction that should be looked at.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't think you understand our reason for wanting lifetaps to be less resistable.  The Lich line of spells takes HP from us, while giving us mana.  Our only way of regaining this hp is to drain it back.  The cleric will get mad at you if he has to waste a heal on the necromancer just because he is Liching down too far.<P>Suggestion: Keep the mana transfer at 3:1, make 49+ Lifetaps ONLY, either on Lure resist, or Unresistable (not preferred), or even just pick a single drain spell and make it that way, but we need something to regain the hp lost from Liching to transfer mana. Thank you for reading this far if you have.<P>Allwyn<BR>"Where am I going, and why am I in this handbasket?"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The darkness line doesnt work as intended:<P>A general rule for spell lines is, that the spells are getting 'better' with their level (for example: the lvl49 rez spell for clerics is 'better' then the lvl39 one).<P>I guess that VI intended to implement the darkness line according to this general rule. If this holds true then lvl49 cascading darkness is broken because it is a downgrade to the lvl29 one.<BR>Lvl29 is better because casting time is more important then damage and slow rate in this spell line.<P>Well imho VI cant be blaimed for this misjudgement  at the beginning of everquest. But we all are wiser now, and so the spell line should be fixed.<P>Ack, and please dont fix it with a nerf, else every necromancer around will try to strangle me with bare hands, you surely dont want that?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055864-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055864.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055864-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055864-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055864-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055864-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055864&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055864&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
