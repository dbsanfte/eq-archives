</FONT><HR>Well if you decide to nerf multi-kiting, via reduced area of the AE or whatever -- please do so to the wizards who already out multi-kite druids at the upper level as well.<P>Or best of all, how about you just leave us both be in this regard eh?  There really aren't that many levels, mobs, etc where this is effective and there usually isn't much competition for those mobs other than other multi-kiters anyway.<P>You aren't likely to improve the enjoyment if this game for any players out with such a change, but I guarantee you will lessen the enjoyment of this game for some.

</FONT><HR>I don't know if adding or subtracting anything would make the druid class better or worse. I'd say the main focus should be why they kite so much? They have good spells, yeah, not as good healing as a cleric, not a DD'er like a wizard, and not a DoT'er like the necros..whats the purpose for a druid in a group? I'd say it would have to be alittle of all of the above. Druids can fill in(kinda) for a healer if he can't heal, a DD'er if he can't cast, DoT'er if he's too lazy to get off his Arse..(yeah, you necros are lazy)<P>I would have to say, if you added anything to a druids spells, add some sort of 15 second invulnerability(like the clerics spell). Can't hit, can be hit..I like that.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think you are toying with a ball of fire here Absor. What you are suggesting is to give an already over powered class even more power. Druids are 1 of 2 soloable classes, necros being the other. I have seen the word Primary Healer in this post multiple times. Clerics are THE primary healer, if you give druids and shamans more of a healing ability you take away more from the clerics, which you have already gouged into alot. <BR>Druids can solo to 50 easy, and fine you may say this game was meant for groups but it happens regardless of what you want. Druids are made (not always but the majority) to be a solo player in order to camp items and make twink characters. This hurts the rest of the players in the game and you will only make it that much easier for them to do so. Imagine my surprise when I saw a druid camping MY quest armour and when asked why they were doing it, they were going to sell it to make a profit. Go to Gfay on most servers which is nicknamed Fay-Mart and take a look at the class of the people selling the items. I can garantee you the majority of them are higher level druids making money for their twink chartacters.<BR>Shamans I can see getting a better healing spell but druids no, they are powerful enough already. Druids have certain benefits and one of them is their soloability. Other classes do not have that option, or have an extremely difficult time of doing so. IF you give druids a better healing spell you better make sure to give the already enraged cleric community something in return to make sure their spot in a group does not get relegated to glorified resurection machine.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor: "Add a new healing spell at 55th level. My suggestion so far is Remedy – a fast casting, low healing spell, and a solid upgrade from Superior Healing that won’t really infringe on the clerics power, which lies in big healing spells."<P>I have to disagree strongly on this one. I'm a 54th level cleric and i use Remedy 80-90% of the time. In a well-balanced group with some form of good mana regen and mob slow, i can Remedy the tank and med the mana back before the tank needs another. Also its our primary "save the caster's tail" spell. <P>Please take a closer look at how powerful remedy is to the cleric class. Giving druids this spell at 55 does indeed infringe on the cleric's power. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>OK I am going to take a direction most will flame me for, but oh well.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>I am part of what is likely a very small group (and maybe I am the only one who knows), but I am a druid in RL. I follow the principles of druidry, and that is why my character is a human druid - seemed logical to make a char as close to myself as possible if I was gonna be living him so long (I was warned before I got the game how addictive it is  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> ). So playing a druid as a druid I get some certain RPing satisfaction out of it. But there are some things that bother me...<P>One is that the EQ druid is far too close to the D&D druid IMHO. Now surely I am not expecting it to be uber close to RL, that would be no fun, but there are some principles that bother me. The first is that druids do not use bladed weapons. In fact, back in the time when druids were a major influence on what is now known as the "Celtic" cultures, it was a blasphemy to even draw a blade in the presence of a druid priest. I thought it a sort of slap in the face that our quest weapon is a scimitar but hey. I guess it's probly too late to change that in game so it's livable. <P>Another part of that is that we can't wear robes  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">  See there are 3 levels of druids in RL: Bards, Ovates, and Druid Priests. Now since Bards are in EQ a class of thier own then I assume we are the priests. In Rl the garb if a druid priest is a white robe with gold adornments. <P>And lastly: we can't practice alchemy. This is the single most major thorn in my paw about EQ druids. Druids have a deep, very, very deep connection with nature. As such we are able to glean a lot of knowledge about the plants and animals around us. This is followed in the charm animals line (which admittedly may be a bit underpowered), but the charm plants thing is way off base. Druids have a very good knowledge and use of herbal remedies etc. This should most definitely be in game. I understand that shamans get it from the whole shamanic lore etc, but this is a skill that fits much better with druids than any other skill. <P>Other than that I think we are fairly balanced. The druids stock in trade is being a jack-of-all-trades. We're good at many different things, you'll not likely find a true druid today who doesn't have  lot of knowledge in a lot of areas. As such this holds really well from an RP perspective: we are good at a lot of things, but the best in few. <P>We are not the best healers, but we shouldn't be druids are not about healing.<BR>We are not the best nukers, but druids are not about wonton destruction. <BR>We are not the best fighters, but druids do not fight unless forced. <BR>What we are ther best at is protection, protection of the world and people around us. <P>This reflects well in game IMHO. As was said before we are some of the best PLers second only maybe to Monks (due to FD). This reflects the RL belief of a druid that the young need the most training, the most help. So there may be a few too many of us, but hey it makes up for the sore lack of us in RL  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>So that's my 2 copper (well OK maybe 10 or 12  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  ), So summary: leave us alone except disable swords or any bladed weapons, add alchemy, and add robes. Then I'd be happy, and I could pretty much just upload myself into EQ and live in the server Lawnmower Man style hehe....<P>Newander Sylvanus<BR>36th season Druid of Tunare<BR>The Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OK sorry had to posta  couple more things I just thought of  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Drimamar-HOK - they did finalyl fix the Nitrate/assassin quest, I did it a few weeks ago. After killing the assassin like 50 times before that I finally got a black wood chip. Took it back to Gereal - got 2gp and a shield - sold it for a few gp I think. So it's about a 1pp quest.<P>As far as quests I like doing them but I think they would really only be effective for RPing reasons.<P>But I saw Drim mention something that did get me going: please please please give us a port to Surefall. or even Everfrost...just something. Even if it's self only. The trip from FP to Halas is atrocious even for us. Takes longer than any other city-to-city trip. And Surefall is a major home for druids, so a port there or even in Everfrost, but somewhere a little nearer Halas and Qeynos please  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I don't really care if a druid was camping your quest armor and you're level 20 it has nothing to do with the issues at hand.

</FONT><HR>A better solution to multi-kiting!<P>Give the lightning spells the same targetting system as AoE rain spells. The spell would strike centered around the AREA the target was in when the spell was cast, not finished. Most mobs being kited would be out of the area of effect by this time but a group of mobs standing still would still be hit. That way our AoE (and other casters) would still be useful in the group setting as intended. <P>I say this because multi kiting IS broken. I know, I've gotten several levels doing it. That is the part of druids that is overpowered, now please address the underpowered parts.<P>And I'd like to add, how many clerics have posted here? Hmm like I'll have to keep my eye open for the cleric thread when it opens. Having played a high level cleric I know just how overpowered they are too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>For those who don't want clerics posting their thoughts on this thread. Who is going to be able to give the perspective on which heals actually infringe on the healing role other than the primary healers?<P>Yes, if one fixates on the healing ability of a druid it pales in comparison to that of a cleric. This is true of many ability niches across class borders.<P>When one looks at druids from a global perspective are they balanced? That is the question being proposed here. I don't play a post-50 druid, I don't know if they are balanced post-50 or not from a global viewpoint.<P>The concern presented in this thread that seems most valid is that of druids not being able to participate in post-50 events. I'm not sure that this is being phrased quite correctly, perhaps I need to go on more of these events, but in each high level raid situation I have been on--more is better. We wanted more people to attend, yes even you druids. Can you heal a tank as well as the cleric can, no--but can you contribute, definately yes.<P>Does 'balanced' mean able to offer the same level of benefit in the same types of activities as every other class? I don't think that it does. I think that a better question to ask in the post-50 game is "Can it be done without out you, but is it also better with you attending?"<P>The argument may rise, "But there are only six group slots!" Form two groups--that is what our guild does, and it doesn't take a guild mentality to cooperate in that way. Pickup groups can split and work together. The same situation is easier with more cooperative people than with less.<P>In conclusion, please keep a global class perspective when proposing nerfs or enhancements, and always ask yourself, "Can I contribute?" I think you'll find that the answer is "Yes!"<P>-Campo</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hello everyone.<P>I stumbled across this while surfing at work as generally when I'm at home, I'm not surfing the boards, I'm playing  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Anyway, it's interesting the ideas that have come up with regards to game balancing the druids.<P>Now, while I haven't played a druid at all, I must admit I felt a little upset with the talk of increasing your healing spells.  I play a cleric.  Played two infact.  <P>Now, some people have posted that currently, the druid attempt at superior heal fizzles way to much.  3-4+ times and pretty much by the time the spell actually goes off, the party member needing it is either dead or out of range.<P>I must say that offering superior heal at 49 would be a something that wouldn't balance the druid, it would add to his/her list of already considerable spell power (I actually checked out the druid spell list the first time today and I was very surprised with the list of spells you all get).<P>This is how I read it - <P>Clerics get greater healing at 24.  Druids get it at 29.  A difference of 5 levels.<P>We get superior healing at 34.  Druids get it at 53. A differnce of 19 levels.  Three times as much differance from the greater healing ratio.<P>Some people have posted that druids should move the superior heal to 49 and that you get rememdy at 55.  This I couldn't agree with.  As a cleric, I only get remedy at 51.<P>Here are my thoughts, as a cleric - <P>I would class anything outside a level 40 spell as a cleric role spell (ie healing) should not be available at all to any other class.<P>Fizzling spells.  Ok, well I have an alteration skill of 206 and a specialise alteration of 167 and only last night, I had 2 fizzles in a row when trying to cast sh.  It's something I've seen before and something that I would expect to see again.<P>When I first go superior heal at 34, I was getting maybe 3-4 fizzles in a row...for about 5 levels, before I was confident in casting it in life saving battle situation.  So as a druid, casting sup heal at 53, I can only think you would be the same.<P>Now, I expect some of you out there probably don't agree with this and I don't mind at all.  Post a reply and explain how you disagree.<P>All I ask is that you keep it civil.  Nothing upsets me more than a thread turning into a flame contest.  Let's make it so the only flame we see is the little animated flame on the folder  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>With thought<BR>Sylvara<BR>45th Priestess</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> Ok, i just want to add my two cents worth. I am geting sick and tired of seeing post from non-druids who wish to flame those of us who DO play the class, and know what the problems are with them in later levels. I am in line with most serious posters here who do not want the moon just a role in groups in the later levels of my eq life for which i have played a long time to get to. I mean half these posts are from clerics who are afraid their MONOPOLY on 50+ and raid etc groups will loosen a bit. Grow up people, how would you like every other class to go to your message board and complain you are overpowered?? Get over yourself please.<BR>     To all the people who say we have way too many druid players, yes you are right....to a POINT. Next time you do a /who all druid see how many are actually past level 30. I see less and less as i get farther in levels(currently 41). You know why? It is frustrating to have no use whatsoever in a group in later levels. As of now my only job in a group without a cleric is continuosly casting greater heal to keep my tanks near healed as well as a cleric and before long that will be useless as well. Oh and pack regen 6 hps a tick woohoo on a tank with 2000 hps.<BR>     Anyway my basic message is just like the other good posters here Absor. Thanks for this post to allow us to vent our problems, and no i dont think we need a lot of fixing at all we just need a JOB after 50. Please i dont want to retire my druid, he was my first character. (btw EVERY class should be useful in the endgame or what is the point??)<BR>again thanks for the good non-flame posts and thanks to Absor again.<BR>Tulladar Traveller<BR>41st season druid<BR>Luclin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Fire may be an element but its not really natural of Earth. Fire destroys natural things. That said, I dont see why clerics have a problem. THey get Complete healing at level 39! This is the best spell at 60, all the better because an ogre Warrior will take about 7-8 superior heals to get full life at that level.<P>Clerics also Rez, and I agree this should be left a cleric spell, not to druids, albeit Roleplaying issues aside (Natures Touch?). Clerics also are still the best for HP and AC buffing. Stuns are also a major assets of the clerics.<P>Another thing Id like to see, from something I mentioned earlier that getting back to your previous spot after teleporting someone is time consuming, Id like to see something else similar to a bind point, but instead of a place you respawn when you die, you can gate back to a temporary spot thats reset after you gate. I dont know what kinda of technical problems this would cause but it would definately help me. Also a group teleport to your bind spot. I dont see any issues with this really with the standpoint of bring in full groups to a place deep within a dungeonm because we arent allowed to bind inside most places Post Expansion.<P>THe three main things IMO-<P>1) Better healing, everyone is saying it, and its true, giving a superior healing pre-50 would not take away anything from the clerics.<P>2) Damage shields - Like I mentioned earlier, something along the lines of adding a damage shield to your attack, rather than just defense, and maybe some damage shield that does % damage return based on how hard your hit.<P>3) Teleports - More teleport locations are absolutely needed. This is not for druids alone, and everyone would want this, for it benefits all classes. We receive zone updates all the time. Adding new locations and changing some zones will not be too difficult I imagine.<P>From the roleplaying stance, this is a roleplaying game, but it doesn't boil down to it in the end. So I guess the charming animals or requesting the service of animals, or having animals run favors for you like making a food run for you is far fetched. If trees were targetable, it would cool to have an animate tree spell. <P>Albeit repetitive, just consolidating my ideas. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi Silvaria!<P>This wont be a flame post i think. I just want to make sure i have this right. You say you cant support giving us (and shamen) remedy at 55 because you only get it at 51? Spells over 40 should be cleric only, which implies less than 40 would be available to secondary healing classes?<P>Does these mean you would be in favor of giving CH and 50% rezzs to us? Because that is what you seem to be saying .. <P>Fortunately for me, thats not what I think would be fair. Whats fair is SH for us at 44, and 2 new heal spells for us (in whatever form) at 54 and 59.<P>I really dont understand why clerics are complaining here, most classes have one area of specialty, clerics have at least 3 or 4 (healing, rezz's, ac/hp buffs, stuns). Further, were not asking them to become second best healers, just narrow the gap between first and 2nd.<P>Also, clerics are the ONLY class that is indipensible for post 50 grouping. Warriors can be replaced with other melee classes, necros can do some short term mezzing, shamen can buff attack speed and slow mobs ... but no one groups post 50 without a cleric.<P>And for those of you that think druids are the most played class in eq .. take a look again ...<BR>do a /who all class count on any server and you will find that honor goes to warrior by a significant margin.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Please do not make the damage from damage shield credited to the caster.<P>Why?<P>1)  Picture this, druid not grouped casts damage shield on tanks.  Then waits and nukes mobs.  Make it easy to Kill steal.<P>2)  Druid casts damage shield on the tanks he is grouped with.  Tanks will have a much harder time taunting a mob off the druid.<P>As for rezs, no sane druid would ever want to do that.  Picture this a druid deep in Seb, get a tell.  Hey I died in perma, could you come rez me then port me to a bank so that I could pay you <BR>for the rez?<P>Now could I see a post 50 shaman getting a rez?  Yes but not get any exp.  It never really sat right with me that races (isk,barb, orge, and troll) can not get a rez.<P>Post 50, please up the damage that damage shields do.  They are almost worthless when you have mobs with well over 5k hit point.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>Absor, do you even PLAY this game?<P>Seeing your post highlighted on everlore.com has brought me here to contest it. You picked an interesting class to start your class-balance discussion with, Druids. Here are my thoughts:<P>You say Druids want to be better healers and you're thinking about giving them new spells along that line? Well, you do that and you can say goodbye to the usefulness of a Cleric. What defines Clerics as a class? HEALING! Clerics heal and .. well, that's about it. Why bother with a cleric anymore when you've got UBER-Druid here with Healing/Buffing/Damage Shield/SoW/Snare/Nuke/DoT/AoE?? Yes, Clerics MAY still be needed for rezzes, but Paladins can do THAT now. Giving druids more heal spells (and earlier) is just WRONG!<P>You think maybe thier planes armor is too heavy? Are you serious? With thier strength buffs they can walk away from any dungeon with more than thier share of items and platinum already. You want to talk about a class in need of lighter armor then you need to address BARDS. They can barely move with all thier quest armor and a weight reducing bag!<P>Oh, and on the topic of Druids getting an Animal Charm that leaves the animal Non-Aggro... What? You're going to outrage every Enchanter that plays if you do anything of that sort without giving them the same spell (and earlier, MUCH earlier).<P>Lastly, I'd like to point a few things out. It's unbelievable how useful druids are already! Not only can they SOLO better than any class out there, but they are the 2nd most wanted class [to enchanters] in ANY group! Here's a breakdown of items that make druids the MOST played class and why:<P>-Snare lasts 3 minutes and has NO chance of breaking! 3 minutes? Do you think that's a LITTLE too long for a level ONE spell?<P>-Ensnare lasts 11 minutes and has NO chance of breaking! My god... 11 minutes? What on earth is going to take 11 minutes to kill? Who designed this spell?<P>-Now that ROOT stacking has been added you've just given Druids a No-Risk Root/Snare/DoT lifestyle. How can it get any easier? Now when the mob breaks ROOT they're still SNARED and will never ever hit you before you get another root to stick. No damage to you and more time to med = druid with more mana after soloing. Thanks Verant!<P>-Tracking. Tracking should be left to rangers and maybe bards, but giving tracking to Druids was wrong to start with. Every druid out there is able to farm every outdoor zone for it's rare spawns and get there before anyone else (SoW) and starting at 20th level! Lucky them, poor ranger get Tracking at level 1 but no SoW til 39, and Bards don't get Tracking til 35. Why did you create the perfect farmer class, Verant?<P>-Quad-Kiting. Yes, you've already acknowledged this. Good.<P>All in all I have to say that it has been my experience that you can't throw a dead halfling without hitting at least one dog in any populated zone. Do you wonder why so many people play Druids? I don't. They already have too much power, don't give them more.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Or you can forget everything previously posted and give druids "Earthly Meditation" for better mana regeneration. But whenever you move or cast a spell you lose it (I.E. it is meditation after all) Should also stack with clarity line of spells.<P>With this I dont think id care about much else.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alright:<P>1.) bring druids race specific items. Give us an incentive of the LEAST to become a half elf! Humans have robes, halflings-exp bonus on race + they have 115 base wis. Wood elves no exp penalty or bonus + 115 wis base! half-elves, a thong? C'mon.<P>2.) Allow Spirit of scale to be slower then sow, but faster then running by about 10% perhaps, yet usable inside dungeons.<P>3.) Put the druid portal in lake rathe nearby Jonah Brucker, the portal in plane of growth, and a few other druid "looking" portals throughout Norrath, the advantage of being teleportable to.<P>4.) IF (I SAID IF) you make a Mid-level questable, or dropped druid only set of armor, make different pieces of it race specific. Stop favoring halflings and wood elves; give humans and half-elves an incentive to be existent.<P>5.) DO NOT IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM mess around with any of the existing spell line of aoe! It's good, perfect, leave it alone. Ruin the distance of casting and instantly wizards will reign supreme.<P>6.) Do not make any lure spells for druids, but at least add an ice based spell before lvl 49.<P>7.) I know it's going to happen, if you remove the need for batwings on Elder spirit boots, it's going to be a self only casting item, please don't change it. It's fine, trust me.<P>8.) No illusions needed, however allow spirit of oak, treeform, and any tree illusion line of spells to work in non-tree zones. If zone modifers require the tree look, allow the tree form to change to the shape of the closest "nature-like" object. If none, make spell tell player "Tunare fears these lands"<P>9.) Give a druid only skill called "hibernation" where the druid will be able to regen hp and mana faster, yet be blind. The skill would advance mana and hp regen as the skill+lvl increased. The skill would only work in the night, or in dungeons. In the argument that it would be like a discipline, allow the skill to be as hard to raise as instill doubt or mend, (hardest skills I can think of to raise) and allow it to only begin working efficiently after lvl 20.  <P>10.) grant druids the ability to use sup heal at lvl 44, remedy at 53, and celestial healing at 60. (I think that's not going to be liked though)<P>11.) The edler spirit gloves are inefficient.  Allow casting time to be changed to a faster form, or change effect of gauntlets to some sort of snare/dot and give it 1-2 more seconds of cast time.<P>12.) Insert new quest material for epic wihch allow you to "hire" the iksar master as an assasin (or replace him with an "iksar assasin") to kill faydedar for you, where as you'd have faydedar spawn, iksar master assist in slaying him and you get whatever item drops, removing the nagafen/vox loot tables of course. Allow that faydedar's corpse WILL depop unless significant dmg (let's say 40%) is dealt to him, otherwise the iksar master will grow angry that you had him do the whole work and in exchange ditch you, so to speak.<P>13.) Again, increase half-elf base wisdom, or give an incentive for them to be played; a half elf druid only plate helm, no drop, quest helm sounds cool, stuff like that.<P>14.) If you use any idea I gave, give me credit. =)<P>~Mizuky Minimum Wisdom<BR>~Quellious server<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049494-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049494.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049494-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049494-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049494-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049494-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=049494&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=049494&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
