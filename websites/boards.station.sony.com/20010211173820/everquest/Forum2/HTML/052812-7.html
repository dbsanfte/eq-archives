</FONT><HR> I love monks and its the only class i've stayed loyal to sence i started playing EQ. I love the idea of taking MoBs apart with my bear hands, the first thing i thought when i heard about EQ was "Ogre Monk"! i was a little disapointed when i found only humans were playable as monks. However this would indeffently be considered a BIG CHANGE so i wont go into it any further.<BR> I would love to see a series of weapons in the game that increase the Dam/Del of our fists (Like the Celestal Fists). Most of you monks out there know this one has been a long time coming. I know the monks already have the badest weapons in the game (With one exception, RoA) but that is my point. I think a monks greatest weapons sould be his/her fists. Of course that is only my opinion.<BR>  The human/iksar suation needs to be looked into. Who in there right mind would play a human over an iksar. I have heard that human monks get more Dam/Del on there fists at high lvls but i have never noticed a difference and besides at that level you will be knee deep in amazing 1hbs and 2hbs to beat up on mobs with so HtH Damage and Delay becomes moot at that point.<BR>  Lastly there is way to much monk armor in the game, for a class that is suposted to be limited in that area we has acces to some of the greatest armor/equipment in the game.<P> Well that is just my 2cp,...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>since were talking balance...<BR>Iksar vs Human is very unbalanced.<P>What is a good reason to pick humans beside the faction issues? None.<P>Iksar 60 more nartual Ac at lvl 60 then human of same level and equip.<BR>Iksar Ultravision, not a big deal but still is an advantages.<BR>Iksar very HIGH hitpoints regen, something along the line of 15hp a tick at lvl 60<P>Oh well, its like comparing a troll warrior with a human warrior.<P>Now for the classes, I think were monk are really lacking currently is the damage part. No we are not the highest Damage dealer fighting class, like we should be. Melee now find relatively easy weapons such as 14/24, 12/20 9/18, etc. Monks can use some too, like 9/18 17/28, 14/28...<P>Im a lvl 55 monk and my fists are 14/28 currently, i also possess a 28/30 2h blunt weapon, that i like very much, but when i use it i must cut so much on weight, that i lose approx. 35ac worth of equip, and i can carry Up to 18.9 without any drawback now. Before level 55, that staff was impossible for me to use, it weight 10.0 with a TOTAL of 13.9 weight limit before having penality. Not only does our armor have weak AC compared to other classes, but we suffer also from our weapons, and we need those weapons JUST to keep up with warriors... <P>Rogues is an entirely other matter, a while ago before kunark it was not an issue when the best weapons available were 10/21 *bone razor* and 13/30 *vox spear*, now those are weak weapons, are among the common types.. They get double backstab at 55(as if they needed that to outdmg us monks) My friend backstab for 350+ almost everytime, using a 13dmg vox spear, he can do it twice in a row, and when he use disciplines he can do twice 1000+.. Even without backstab they arent far behind if not better then us(depending on the monk weapon, if fists then we are way behind) hitting for 40-70 dmg at a 20delay in dual weild, is pretty impressive.<P>What i suggest for monks, Either a raise in Damage to our fists at higher levels, a raise in caps on some skills , Defense/offense(we were balanced because of those 2 skills before the 50+ caps, now most melee classes cap at the same as us) Reduce weight on our 2h blunts (especially those that are 10.0) Raise the AC on the shiverbacks( there is no pieces i find myself using anymore, its bascially junk, we can find better in upperguk on a lvl 30 mob, ie gatorscale leggings 7ac +15hp 0.4 weight, or our superb shiverback leggings with 5ac 5wis(?) 5agi 7vs fire 0.1weight) among with alot of others.<P>Also i noticed a HUGE improvement in armor for all melee classes in Kunark, cobalt, Deepwater etc. Huge ac improvement, along with some useful and less useful spell, we get nothing of the sort.<BR>Sure we can use some new armor... Fungi tunic, iksar hide boots come to mind, both weighting over 2.0 each. But those aren't monk only<P>Another point i wanted to put out, Does everyone think Monks are wealthy? i know i rarely loot for coins because they weight so much, i see most the the Monk stuff cost 2 to 3 times more then the best gear of warriors for example... FUngi tunic 60k or so(depending on server of course) Tranquil staff 60k, jade mace 20k, iksar hide boots, 12k, staff of shielding priceless? etc. etc. Why? is this the new influx on twink monks... shrug, i see jasarth trident go for 8k and cobalt armor around 4k on my server, and its better or same ratio as jademace<P>Anyways, Monk need more damage output and armor upgrades that are low weight, and usuable only by them. Thanks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I've read all 6 pages (whats currently up as of my posting). And I am going to try NOT to repeat anything. However I'm sure my brain has phased out 3 or 4 times during the reading (I don't know how you do it Absor). I'm trying to only mention items I have a specific opinion on.<P>Raising damage output -<BR>     I have seen several posts stating that monks should be in between a Warrior and a Rogue. I completely disagree. There is only ONE time a Rogue should outdmg me and thats when he is backstabbing. Warriors are considered a plate class, so they should have the lowest dmg output. Monks are considered a leather class (shoot I met a twinked 25 necro back when I was 25 that had MORE hp then me), since we can take very little dmg, we should dish out the most. Rogues armor level falls right in between, call them a banded class like Rangers if you want, so they should have a dmg output right in the middle of Monks and Warriors. But from behind they should annihlate us.<P>Fixes for dmg output -<BR>     Triple Attack : Yes its been said before but I am adamant on this one. I remember at 35 when I spent the 8k I had saved up for so long from items sales and bought my FBSS. The battle spam complaints started then and they never stopped. It's a feeling monks like to fill up a screen with attacks.<P>     There are many other suggestions (some I'll mention in Skills section below) that I won't repeat for Absor to read for the 100th time.<P>Skills -<BR>     Instill Doubt : Leave the success of this falling about where its at. But decrease the resistability. I have a Necro as well and yes Fear is a fairly resistable spell as it SHOULD be. But I don't think I've EVER ID'd a white/black or higher con.<P>     Spirit Walk : When I read the post from the guy asking for the skill to "leave our body" and safely explore the dungeon without interacting, I KNEW you wouldnt consider it but just in case.... do not give us this skill it is TOTALLY unbalancing. The ability to explore a new dungeon and con all the inhabitants as well as find traps with no risk to ourselves is ridiculously over powered.<P>     Feign Death : I understand why you want this skill to be less effective in seperating MOBs however I don't think it should be nearly unusable as it is in Velious. My suggestion: make only SOME mobs intelligent enough to wonder why that Monk just fell over like he was dead. Example: In Crystal Caverns everything there will REMAIN aggro'd on you til you zone. Take a monk and run to the queen room. Now aggro whats in there and run all through the hall aggroing everything. Now stop in the empty hall. Feign. Wait for the mobs to leave. Get up. They're on you again. Now do the same thing but do the "Velious Trick" of feigning 20 times in a row without moving. They'll forget you. However go attack anything you had aggroed before. Now wait for every spider down there to come running at you cause they just remembered. Now that makes feign pulling IMMPOSSIBLE. Now make those spiders "Stupid" so when you die a couple times they forget you. But now say the Queen (sticking with the Crystal Caverns example), or a Drachnid, or maybe the Life Leech, should still remember you and should in the case of maybe 3 or 4 feigns in a row completely IGNORE feign. I'm not basing this on levels mind you I'm basing this on being a "special mob" if say a 60 monk went into Crushbone, Emperor Crush should be smart enough to see through feign because he's special.<P>     Natural SOW: Here is my opinion on this. As the pullers in the game it would be helpful to ALL classes if we ran a little faster. And it makes sense due to our wt restriction as well. We should run faster then a nearly fully loaded caster. As to keep this from unbalancing make the SOW a progressive increase that will NEVER bypass lvl9 SOW (34%). I propose an increase of 0.5% per level which caps us at 30% at lvl 60. However you should STACK this with SOW. YES this will make us insanely quick at higher levels but even at 60 we would be 15% UNDER Spirit of Cheetah. And as we are the "ninja" pullers this should NOT be unbalancing. And will also keep the druids/shammys from saying that reduces thier need any (though one less SOW to cast would increase thier mana you still want to keep your buffers happy  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> )<P>     Special Attacks: Both fizes I've seen for these are great ideas. I REALLY like the idea of adding a small effect to each skill increasing its viability. This would vastly improve the variety of my battles. However even with the recent increas to 10 hotkeys I would be forced to switch between hotscreen keys quite a bit during battle. Even though it's not quite as fun the chain suggestion is another good way to increase our dmg potential, while still from a gameplay perspective, would be easier on the player. <P>     Stun: I do not feel we should recieve stun. That is the job of my casters to stun the mob. I do not want to decrease the usefulness of any other classes.<P>     Safe Fall Jumping Bonus: While it makes sense from a "ninja"/RPing point of view. It could be unbalancing in a dungeon not designed with this skill in mind. ("Hey guys I'll meet you there I just jumped up to the next lvl bypassing a couple dozen traps and dangerous monsters") There is also the problem of trying to get used to an EVER increasing jump distance. I'd HATE to over jump something in say SolA.<P>Items -<BR>     Weight Limit: LEAVE it alone. The increase in upper levels was a good move. However staying under 15 wt is PART of being a monk. I really feel if you have trouble with the wt limit. YOu should try another class that may be more to your liking.<P>     Mid-lvl Weapons: It sure was strange in the late 30s early 40s having 3k in the bank and wielding two Canes of the Tranquil I could not,  even with selling the Canes (2k each), afford to buy a 1hb combo or even a single 2hb that was an upgrade from my canes. Shoot I couldn't even afford a single Knuckle Duster or Trance Stick  (the next viable upgrades wt wise for a monk from Canes) both of which range from 8-10k.<P>Quests: Monks have 6 quests total.<BR>Qeynos and Freeport sashes: I did these in my mid 30s only so I could turn them in for my Lost Circle Robe.<P>Treant Fists: Never did it. Gem Inlaid's are just as good and MUCH easier to get. I have heard the summon bandages request a dozen times but frankly for a 30+hour quest I still wouldn't do it just for that. How about Summon Pouch of Quellious. Or something along those lines maybe a 4 slot backpack with 100% wt reduction and wt of 0.0 that is NO RENT and ONLY holds summoned items. It would come with 2 stacks of summoned bandaids, 1 stack of food, 1 stack of water.<P>Thanks for your time Absor. I know ALL of us are VERY appreciative of your efforts in class-balancing.<P>Annihlus Maximus<BR>Brightblade Knights of Saryn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bump, and another thought.<P>Seems your item designers feel that adding nice stats (str, agi, etc.) to an item will make them attractive to monks.<P>For the most part, wrong.<P>If you were to do a poll, I think you'd find that most monks are looking for AC/HP/Resists combined with low weight when considering a piece of gear to replace what they currently have.  Some are even moving to HP/AC/Resists with a thought to the big boys in SoV because they need every scrap of HP they can get to survive those encounters.<P>Case in point, the new Black Panther armour:<BR>Full set, less the boots which have not been successfully made yet: AC +79, Str +35, Dex +37, Sta +44, Agi +17, Cha +11, HP +95, weight 12.5 <P>Compared to the gear I currently have in those slots: AC +97 Str +10, Dex +11, Agi +7, Sta +5, Int +5, Wis +9, HP +130, Weight 4.8<P>Hm, more AC, more HP, almost 1/3 the weight in exchange for losing some stats.  Given the underwhelming impact of stats in EQ, is it any wonder that I, and many monks, wouldn't touch black panther armour with a 10 foot pole?  Imagine equipping a tranquil staff with that junk!<P>Stop trying to entice us with stats, it doesn't work for the most part, and you end up with yet another set of monk gear that nobody ever wears.  <P>Give us low weight and good AC.  If you're still determined not to give us AC, then make it HP, lots and lots of HP.<P>Tilric<BR>50 monkey<BR>Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My monk is only 41, but I have friends who are high level monks, and I have discussed issues with them.  Most of the suggestions in this thread are geared to 50+ monks, so let me add some things that I would like to see for levels below 50.<P>1 - Change the stats on the headbands/sashes.  They are worthless statwise, even the most difficult to obtain ones.  I mean, have you ever seen a level 30 monk wearing their purple headband or red sash?  No.  How about increasing the stats a little more as each quest progresses, and add an effect on the high end ones.  Like make the red sash have a 3-4% haste element.  This is hardly overpowering, but is a nice monk-type reward for completing the quests to get this sash.  Adding an ultravision or see invis effect to the purple headband would be a nice bonus as well.<P>2 - as someone earlier suggested, allow monks to quest for the black headband and black/purple sashes.  Make it a high level quest (like over level 45) and give the headband/sash nice stats that are commensurate with that level.  I would suggest making the quests over 50, but these are on the old continent and doing that would exclude non-Kunark owners.  Or make it so level 50s could do it - doesn't matter.  Just make these items questable so the monk has a status symbol they can obtain from their guild.<P>3 - add a minimum damage to flying kick.  Perhaps leave it as is from 30 to 40.  At 40, minimum becomes level/3 and over 50, it becomes level/2.  Add a small chance for a critical kick (less than 5% maybe) post 50.  Critical kick does double normal damage.<P>4 - add a chance for dragon punch and/or flying kick to stun, even if just for a half second - should be enough to interrupt casters.<P>5 - Quests.  Several good suggestions in this thread for quests, but I want to focus on two ideas.  First, make armor that fits between Crescent and Pantherskin statwise, but have it questable for monks in their mid 30s to low 40s.  Second, a quest for a 100% weight reduction bag that is monk only (NODROP) and all the components are NODROP would be wonderful.  Monks are the only class in the game with the weight restriction, yet the best weight reducer in the game is 5250pp, best price.  Monks cannot loot because of the weight of coins and items, so most monks that are not twinked do not get a tinkers bag until their 40s.  Why not add a quest that monks could do in late 30s, early 40s for a bag that is the equivalent of the tinkers bag.  This would be a reward for struggling with the weight restriction all of our lives.<P>6 - add a hide skill to go with our sneak skill.  Sneak is maxed at 113, so why not give the monk the ability to learn the Hide skill, which also caps at 113.  The two can be used in conjunction to make the monk invisible to most mobs, but not to undead.  And the ability can not be used to evade mobs that have the monk on their hate lists like Rogues can.  Rogues still have the ability to move at full speed post 50, monks would not get this either.<P>7 - up the damage per fist post 50, or add a damage bonus to the offhand post 50, similar to the primary hand bonus below 50.<P>None of these suggestions would be unbalancing to other classes, but would make the monk a more rounded character and with the slight damage changes we would be a better addition as a damage dealer to high end groups (which is our job after all =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ooops I cut my message off with out finish my quest opinions.<P>As I said we have 6 quests, and I ran through sashes and treant. The other 3 are:<P>Robe of the Lost Circle and Whistling Fist:<BR>A great robe that is a sign of achievement in EQ. However with the release of Velious it is not as viable when robes/tunics of nearly the same usefullness can be purchased or looted at about the same lvl. And so these 2 quest become the same as the sashes (only done so you can turn in your whistling fist in  the Epic)<P>Celestial Fists: It's Epic, it's great, leave it as is.<P>Wow so out of our wopping 6 quests only one is woth doing. But of course we still do 5 of the 6 quests since 4 of them are required for our Epic.<P>everQUEST????<P>P.S. Wheres my Quellious armor?

I read a post way back on this thread that commented on AD&D 3 monks, In AD&D 3 the monks main advantage is they recive a Wis Bonus to there Armor Class. Iksar has a low wisdom were humans have a balanced Wis, If you give bonuses to AC for wis i think this would be more blanced (Of corse Iksars have natural AC bonus and this would only alow humans to keep up with Iksars) But just a thought, now back to watching the post borads fill up!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The only thing i think they should change is make FD more effective, at higher lvs pulling from dungeons it's hell, i pull say 3 or 4 mobs and FD wait till they one by one walk to spawn point but as soon as i get up they al come back again, i know that lv 35+ mobs have a chance of not forgeting u even if u FD but sometimes i have to FD 10 times just to get a single pull back to camp spot, either decrease the chance of the mobs remembering u or give say lv 50+ monks a new FD that it's exactly like FD as it used to be prenerf.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'd like to add my support for Bodi's post, it has many good ideas in it.<P>One of the few things I would like to add is the (bugged?) way in which spells can currently break FD.<P>If a monster's spell lands on a feigned monk, which the monster started casting before the monk feigned, it will break the feign and the monk will be attacked. Even if the spell is resisted.<BR>This makes it VERY hard for those of us on slow connections to time our FD correctly. I play from Europe and often have to play with high ping times and packet loss.<BR>I know connection quality will always have some effect on gameplay, but I think it shouldn't make the difference between being able to feign off two casters or having trouble with just one.<BR>It's often just luck of the draw for me where for someone with a good connection it's merely a matter of timing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here's my list of bonuses that monks need.. I'd like at least a couple of them added, maybe that would encourage me to go back to monks O_o<P>Fists need to continue to increase in damage after 50.. Using fists rather than uberweapons should always have some kind of merit in the game.<P>Monks should have a higher natural AC, or dodge skill, or whatever. Anything that makes us get hit less. In baldur's gate II, monks are totally immune to phsyical damage after level 20 O_o<P>Monks should get Triple Attack, long before warriors do.<P>A new combat skill after Flying Kick would be great, but that might be too much to implement.<P>Monks should receive a couple of points damage bonus with all weapons. If you ask me, it is totally unacceptable that rogues do more damage than monks.. We should be in groups because of our kickass damage, not our pulling skills.<P>Fist delay should go down further than it does. Fists should be among the fastest weapons in the game.. There are weapons out there faster than fists. ***? either you can hold a weapon that weighs a couple pounds, or you can hold nothing. I think you'll find that you'll be a little more agile with your hands while holding nothing.<P>Some high level gloves that increase hand to hand damage would be great. I'm not sure if there is any such thing, but if there is there should be more.<P>Maybe monks should get a slight running bonus over other classes...<P>Instill Doubt should include an animation that gives the enemy the finger =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The only thing I would really like to see change of for a monk to get any type of real melee stun.  Like the bash for lower level warrior classes or the kick for higher warriors.  Flying kick should have a chance to stun, or at least add it to our level 52 discipline (which is less than worthless now) thunderkick.  You might also want to consider adding a skill called Trip or Sweep that stuns and won't let FK or other monk skills refresh for longer than usual.  A final suggestion would be to let us use more than one attack ability per round.  A flying kick and a dragon punch in the same round would be nice.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>When feign death was originally nerfed, I believe one of the reasons was that it did not fit into the concept of role playing or a tactic that could actually be used in reality.  Imagine this scenario.  Having just left the ranger station in Yellowstone Park, you begin you solitary hike through the wonders of nature.  Walking over the crest of a hill you are confronted by three large, vicious, and unfortunately hungry grizzly bears.  If you had gone hiking with a friend, to escape the bears you would just have to out run your friend; however since you are alone, you will have to out run the bears.  Sprinting towards the ranger station with the bears gaining on you, the only thing you can think to do is drop to the ground and pretend to be dead.  The bears knock you lifeless body around for a few minutes. The bears become bored with your lifeless form and continue their journey in the wilderness believing that there is one less camper to start a forest fire.  You open your eyes only to face one last bear that was slower than the rest to resume its journey.  Springing to you feet, you make another mad dash to the ranger station.  Alerted by your screams the ranger appears with a tranquilizer gun and drops the grizzly bear at the doorstep of the ranger station.  The ranger looks at you and says, “Nice job breaking the spawn”.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor, Thank you for giving the Monks a chance to finally speak about some of the issues we have I believe two major issues are a problem for the monk class, and I will break them down into those two sections. Followed by possible solutions, some of which have been previously suggested through different media.<P>First, the Iksar vs. Human argument¡K<P>Races aren¡¦t equal, everyone knows that a gnome warrior doesn¡¦t even begin to stand up against an ogre. This is FINE, when you logged into Everquest your first day you could see the stats and know the advantages and disadvantages of the races. The difference in this case and the reason I believe there is a valid point here is that Iksar were added over a year after initial release and many, many players were 50 at that time.<BR>	<BR>Now I am not saying they should be equal but there should be well-balanced disadvantages and advantages that are less extensive then now. As it stands now the difference in the classes is as such¡K(This is based off level 60 but is apparent in lower levels as well of course)<P>Iksar:<BR>-Forage<BR>-Night Vision<BR>-60ac Auto Bonus<BR>-Regenerate +15 a tick over a human<P>Human:<BR>-Better Factions<BR>-No Race Penalty<P>The pros just don¡¦t at all equal the cons. The regen is huge coupled with the fact the iksar can wear the fungi tunic. AC is what monks strive for and 60 free ac is a massive bonus. And the night vision and foraging are great little free add-ons but I won¡¦t base any factors off of them. The regen makes sense; you pay for regen with a racial penalty a pretty even balance. The AC does not, balance wise Iksar were given racial ac bonus based on the fact that they can not wear plate mail. However, everything I a 59 monk wears can be worn by an iksar. So this 60ac comes as just a freebie that creates a huge balance issue.<P>My suggestion to fix this one, it¡¦s too late for drastic changes but to at least partially make up for it, give the human monk the same AC bonus¡KI¡¦m not a fan of nerfing others for relative balance. This would at least make Iksar/Human a choice for people and not the obvious one-sided vote it is now.<P>Now onto the second issue...<P>As things have fleshed themselves out over 2+ years monks in most peoples opinions have come across as sort of a Rogue/Warrior hybrid. Rogues being the absolute masters of damage and warriors being the absolute masters of tanking and monks falling somewhere in between. The problem is monks get the worst of both worlds. Using imaginary numbers to state my point followed by real hard numbers in a minute I will show you why monks don¡¦t fall where they logically should¡K<P>Damage<BR>Rogue: 200<BR>Monk: 130<BR>Warrior: 100<P>Tanking<BR>Warrior: 200<BR>Monk: 105<BR>Rogue: 100<P>Logically, and how I believe it should be is that monks should be at the 150 range in both category¡¦s making them a better hybrid of the two, but not at all stepping on the toes of the specialists. Here¡¦s some harder numbers.<P>HPs(Level 60)<BR>Warrior: 3450<BR>Monk: 2050<BR>Rogue: 2000<P>AC(Level 60)<BR>Warrior: 1115<BR>Monk: 1025<BR>Rogue: 1020<P>Here is the defensive side. Now as you can see monks fall right at the bottom in both categories. More logically¡K<P>HPs(Level 60)<BR>Warrior: 3450<BR>Monk: 2775<BR>Rogue: 2000<P>AC(Level 60)<BR>Warrior: 1115<BR>Monk: 1072<BR>Rogue: 1020<P>This would put monks right in the middle of the two making them a bit more efficient at tanking but still not even a beginning substitute for a warrior, which is how it should be.<P>Next, is the offensive side monks are a little better here as stated with my fictional numbers based on hard facts. So I suggest a small boost in damage which could be accomplished in any of the following ways, one or more as obviously some are more powerful than others.<P>Damage Increase<P>-New Level 50 special attack, Crane Kick perhaps, caps higher than Flying kick has same recycle time and does about 50-100% more damage. This would add up to about 8% extra overall damage and the small boost that is needed along with the defensive changes.<P>-Specialty based ¡§Special¡¨ attacks. Monks have many special attacks: Round House, Tiger Claw, Eagle Strike, Dragon Punch, Flying Kick, most of which have never been used past level 30. I think specializing these attacks for the situation would be a very cool idea. Flying kick could have a small chance to be very critical and do 3x-5x damage. Dragon Punch could have a good chance to stun. Eagle Strike could have a good chance to debuff the ac/str of the enemy. Tiger Claw could have a small chance to snare the enemy¡Kall these are just ideas and could be tooled around with ƒº<P>-More Damage, this one is easy, change the damage table so monks hit 10-15% harder or miss 10-15% less etc, this is the least creative but the easiest to implement.<P>Any of these would greater balance the offense of monks against the powerful rogue.<P>I am not trying to make a monk the master of everything, there are specialists and there are hybrids. A hybrid of two melee classes is a equal balance of both. I feel a monk should fall right in the middle of the two, where a specialist tank like a warrior or a specialist damager like a rogue would do better a monk can fill the gap more effectively when none can be found.<P>There are also a few quick and small nit picky things that REALLY bother me and require no balance changes to rectify.<P>-The monk epic weapon Celestial Fists hit fast, VERY fast, I don¡¦t even like hitting fast in the first place it taunts too much but if that¡¦s not subject to change I want a simple chat filter that lets me turn my own hits off so I don¡¦t have to watch the screens and screens of spam of hits for 10<P>-The effect on the monk epic weapon Celestial Fists lasts exactly 10 seconds, there is no real reason for this I can see. If possible changing the effect to 5 minutes or more would not really change anything but make it easier on my fingers.<P>-Finally, the effect on the Celestial Fists (Celestial Tranquility) does not stack with ANY kind of haste spell. Obviously the haste itself should not stack, as this would drastically change the balance. But, we had a robe previous to this (Robe of the Whistling Fists) that stacked perfectly with pure enchanter haste spells like Aanya¡¦s Quickening, Wondrous Rapidity etc. I simply ask that it be made like this so the ac/atk portion of the buff stacks with enchanter buffs without unbalancing things by the haste stacking also.<P>I believe monks are a good class but as the stuff gets to be harder and harder monks in simple groups are thought of more and more as a low damage rogue or ¡§just a puller¡¨. A monk can substitute a rogue in some groups although not as effective, but as things have become much harder even for the small groups of six, monks can¡¦t even begin to replace a warrior and therefore don¡¦t act as a good enough hybrid.<P>Thanks.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'll try to avoid things that have allready been said but I guess it's a bit hard :P<P>1) I like the weight limit. A lot. The weight limit is what makes a monk interesting to play. When 2 monks meet they almost allways inspect each other. We have all a problem: the Weight limit and we are all looking for solutions. This is good and fun.<P>2) Despite the widspread belife, Monks are NOT suposed to be pullers. Pulling is a strategy Verant does not like so don't say "Fix FD we can't pull anymore" because it was precisely nerfed for that reason.<BR>That leads me to a question: What is the specific role of the Monks acording to Verant's Vision?<P>3) Monk usable 2HB weapons weapons are either too lame to be used above 20 or Extremely rare<P>4) Take a good look at the Monk quests and adjust their difficulty. While you are at it, add the missing Shackle quest anf the missing Headband and SDash quests. Implement the Whisting Fists Quest. Implement Storm Saber and Tynn Foil (if they are in game no one ever found one...)<P>5) Try to find a balancing way to make many, if not all, the special moves used for some good reason. Special effect or Combo are good ideas.<P>6) It would be nice to add some fun stuff like  the short duration Lev or the high Jumps or the IKSAR SOUNDING LIKE GODZILLA! (Please Akriss.... go away from me with this Oxygen Destroyer...)<P>7) For some reason I attacked a Rhino in Eastern Waste. It was stronger than I thought so I FD'ed. When hit was far away I standed but it ran back at me. I FD'ed and stood up while taking the Rhino to the Iceclad zone. In 10+ FD the Rhino just did not forget me. Look into this  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>8) I got troubles with a tar goo in Wakening Lands. It was camping the corpse of my Mage friend and then camping my FD'ed self. 1 hour later and some GM scrtching their heads latter a druid solved the problem. Look into this please  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>As I am allready a bit out of the subject I'll end this post saying that as far as I have played Monk is a very good class that seem to need only some subtle tuning to be perfectly balanced.<P>Szlia Southpaw<BR>Swifttail in her 4th rung.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I believe that monks are meant to be masters of their own body and mind. They master themselves to manipulate people, monsters, and the environment around them. This personal mastery and discipline is also what gives them the intense melee capabilities that they have. All of these things contribute to making the monk class enjoyable. <P>Some fun enhancements to the monk class could be focused around the ability to protect and cure the body. This is similar to mend works now. First, monks could consume a greatly reduced amount of food and water or perhaps go for days without food and water before being “hungry and thirsty”. Secondly, higher resistances to disease, poison, and perhaps harm touch make sense or maybe this fluctuates with other conditions. Third, a small enhancement to the mend ability at high levels which would allow pressing mend to not only heal the hp, but cure anything afflicting the monk at that time, like poison, blindness, disease, etc.  Finally, it would be nice to re-examine the weight limit for monks. Perhaps if this was based on a percentage of strength instead of a fixed number, it would be a greater challenge and more flexible for adding equipment. If a monk were to chose to add AC items only, they would be more limited to weight than if there was a mix of ac and strength. Maybe the limit would be tied to agility too since that is what a monk relies on for his abilities. Basically, monks’ options would be broadened if he focused on building a well-rounded character and tightened if focused on raw AC, which would thus limit equipment choices.<P>Another area that could be enhanced to make the class more enjoyable to play is focused around attack. There are two contradictions in logic with design of the monk class for attack and damage. First, they are made masters of attack through increased skill levels in weapon and hand-to-hand melee, however, this awesome skill level never allows for critical hits. I would think that a monk would have the ability to score a critical punch, crush, or kick and effectively stun a target for a random duration of time after their skill level reaches its max. Secondly, there needs to be a certain level of skill when a monk simply cannot perform a flying kick and deal out 3 damage. This ability was learned in the low 20’s and by level 60, the monk should get a minimum damage of his level or some other calculation base on his skill. Finally, also in regards to special attacks, I would like to see the monk “internal haste” also apply to his special attacks. Again, at level 60 and max skill in flying kick, I simply cannot do it any better or more often than I could when I learned it.<P>All of the changes I have mentioned, to me, are focused around making the class more enjoyable to play. Some are focused around simple enhancements that make you think about choices you make. Some are focused around reward for hard work, like doing 60 damage versus 3 on a level 60 flying kick. I have enjoyed the monk class for the most part, but have also become extremely frustrated at times when I max every skill and every quest and yet I struggle to raise my key stats to acceptable levels or I perform a “Thunderous Kick” for 2 damage and listen to the giggles.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>2HB: <P>Make us hit more often with these particular weapons, and when we hit make us hit for higher damage rather than lower.

</FONT><HR>Ok heres my 2 cents..<P>More weight would be nice but not necessary as it does add challenge to equipiing.<P>The whole weapons issue ill kinda skip but now that they are here give us something between batons and the impossible to get stuff or bounce our hands up more as we gain levels.  Our damage vs others combined with our no ac and no hp is really starting to drop the need for us.<P>I like the idea of a quest based alteration to skills.  Say a quest to add stun chance to ANY of our specials.. a quest to add damage to ANY of our specials.. I dont agree with a debuffing addition to our specials as how can a master of his own body and meelee attacks remove a magical effect?<P>New skills above FK would be nice before the 50 disciplines.  say chain attacks OR practically any of the listed suggestions in these many posts.<P>But aside from all that the one main I would wish for would be to make us Stun PROOF - ie unable to be stunned.  We are masters of our bodies.  Our ac is evasion based.  Our prime weapons were/are our hands.  We can heal ourselves.  If all this is true why could anyone damage us enough to stun us?  To add this ability would make us again the prelim damage dealers without altering almost anything else.<P><BR>well thats it for me<P>Shoulynn Shadouwalker<BR>34th human monk<BR>Prexus Outcasts - Prexus server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>as for FD nerfs<P>the way wandering monsters react to FD is NOT a good solution now... that is what causes trains and ghost trains to all zones<P>if the monster is above 35+ and does not have a fixed spawn, it will most likely never forget a FD monk... that means that eventually the monk has to get up to move and he will re-aggro that wandering monster (which in turn might aggro whatever is close to it while it is moving) and VOILA!... a ghost train from nowhere with the monk FD for 10 minutes before<P>wanderers should have 100% forget the FD person... this would solve alot of problems for trains in many zones<P>as for the rest of these posts, i see some good suggestions and some creative suggestions... but A LOT of unrealistic suggestions!<P>people please...
