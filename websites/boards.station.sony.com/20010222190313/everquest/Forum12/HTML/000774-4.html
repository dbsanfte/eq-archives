</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt; ITEM: DoT Pet.<P>I do not like this suggestion because it flies in the face of what an enchanters is.  An enchanter enchants.  He makes his friends more powerful or his opponents weaker and provides advantage to his groups in this way.  To use Verant's own phrase WE ARE NOT A PET CLASS.  If you want to tell us that and put us in that category, then don't compound past mistakes by giving us a new one here.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Food for thought Absor:<P>Pets (and their masters) will never be welcome in fights against uber mobs until a couple major problems are solved.  <P>1.  Pets contribute more to lag than they do to killing the mob.  (see below for explanation)<P>2.  Pets spend more time running away from mobs than they do damaging the mob, and bring friends back to the raid when they stop running.<P>3.  Pets are generally hit by AE damage spells cast by the uber mob more than a tank would be.  Level differences and lack of high enough resists/resist gear place pets at a severe disadvantage to an uber mob.<P>************ Solutions *************<BR>EXPLANATION OF LAG PROBLEM AND FIX:<BR>Every time a character (NPC or PC) takes an action that needs to be reported to other players, it contributes to lag.  If I have 20 PC's and pets hitting on a mob, every time a hit occurs, it gets copied to 20 people, creating 20 * 20 = 400 messages.  These get filtered out using the chat filter, yes.  But the messages still seem to be sent from the server to the client, although they get ignored by the client - this reduces client side lag but does nothing about server lag.  Thus, one way to reduce linkdeaths during a raid is to reduce the number of things hitting the uber mob and have them use slower, harder hitting weapons.  One guild on my server consistently fails to take down trak despite bringing 60 or so people to the raid.  They wonder why half go linkdead almost immediately.  The answer is simple.  <P>Take 60 people on raid: 60 * 60 = 3600 messages per "round"<P>as opposed to <P>Take 36 people on raid: 36 * 36 = 1296 messages per "round"<P>The reason pets will always be a problem on   uber mobs is that they contribute to this lag without doing a reasonable amount of damage in return.  If I have 36 "slots" for the raid before lag becomes unbearable, do I want a pet, or do I want a tank?   Simple, when it comes to damage output and hp, tank &gt; pet.  The only solution that "balances" this problem is creating a new line of pet with the same damage output per minute (same ratio) but making the pet hit less often for more damage.  The pets will do the same damage over time, but contribute far less to the lag problems we see on raids.<P><BR>FIXING PETS RUNNING AWAY:<BR>The test server has a change that makes a 59th level pet spell that makes the pet immune to fear.  The pet classes simply put need resist buffs specifically for their pets.  They need to be balanced to increase teh pet's resists to keep the pets in the battle at least as frequently as a tank would be.  The current Immune to Fear spell given to Magicians on Test has 2 problems.<BR> First, pet classes begin to have this problem at about 45 or 46, not at 59.  Second, immunity is too powerful.  Make it an insane buff, but do not allow it to make the pets immune.  I'd rather see a + 120 MR pet only buff than an immunity to fear.  Yes, this makes them more resistant to magic based ae damage, but see #3 above.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>So, CC needs to be spread out.<P>Fair enough.<P>Who do you give it to?<P>Druids: Can solo up to 50, outdoors are basically unkillable by anything yellow or less by running away, have many group-useful abiltities: heals, evaks.<P>Shamans: Can solo up to 50, best dots, best slows, 2nd best speeds, best self-mana regen, 2nd best caster AC, best caster melee, best stat buffs.<P>Bards: Tank defence.  Low tank armor.  Low tank HPs.  Can solo to 50.  Can outrun almost anything.  Can snare.  Can charm-kite.  Nearly as good mana regen as a 'chanter.  Nearly as good haste as a 'chanter, haste stacks with all other classes haste.<P>Necromancers: Can solo to 50.  2nd best self-mana regen.  2nd best pets.  can heal.  can move mana.  FD.  Better AC than any other int caster.<P>Wizards: ... *grin*.  Ya, let them mez.  Evak, best DD by a sliver, only unresistable DD at a level where DD starts becomes infeasible in SoV, ...  worst self-mana regen, worst snare (AoE snare - great, get yourself).<P>Clerics: *lol*.  Best Rez.  Gets Rez 20 levels before the only other class that gets a 'real' rez (as opposed to the necro xp-transpher spell).  Best heals.  Best non-haste buffs.  Best caster AC.  Best targetted stuns.<P>Warriors: huh?<P>Rangers: Give them mez.  Really.  Give them outdoor mez, might make them viable.  Call it 'cute-ass woodelf ranger wiggle'.  Give them more aggro problems.  Still, they can deal with it better than an enchanter can.<P>Palis: Plate AC.  With mez.  Ya, good idea.  Wait, that was the bard.  Nevermind.<P>SKs: See Palis.  More justification - screaming terror.<P>Monks: huh?<P>Rogues: Change instill doubt?   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>So, what do Enchanters have to contribute?  Given that mez is given away.<P>1&gt; Mana regen.  Once every half-hour.<BR>2&gt; Speed spells.  Right-click every half-hour.<P>3&gt; Nuke Damage.  Wait, uber aggro, low efficiency.  _Clerics_ are better at this.  And Clerics only nuke when bored.<BR>4&gt; Debuffs.  Wait, don't do nothing.<BR>5&gt; MR debuff.  Wait, uber aggro.  And, malosi does more when it sticks.  Lots more.  Still, one thing, so long as we are getting lots of xp and have a cleric to rez us every fight.  Can also be used for hate-kiting...<BR>6&gt; Rune series.  Less efficient than symbol line in pretty much every way.  Aggros more.  Costs more.  Really, toss it on a puller and yourself and the clerics.  Although, did you folk know it absorbes canabalize damage?<BR>7&gt; Ultravision.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>8&gt; Root.<P>...<P>Hmm.  So, other than the stuff you can handle by casting once every half hour, and Ultravision, necros can do everything we can actually do without dieing immediately better.<P>So can bards.<P>I mean, really, if bards where as good as 'chanters at mez, what could a chanter do that a bard couldn't do better?<P>More HPs.<P>Better MR (tank equipment).<P>Better AC (tank equipment).<P>Haste that stacks better.<P>Mana regen that stacks better.<P>Can always kite extras.<P>Better charming abilities.<P>Better damage dealing.<P>Can help the group travel.<P>...<P>We do get illusions.  And we can up our faction a bit easier.  We solo worse, so we need groups more.  .  .<P>I've even heard a rumour that Necros' and bards can mez' giants...  Wow, is that true?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>More food for thought Absor:<P>Recast time is a very effective way to make spells that "tweak" the uber encounter without unbalancing the rest of the game.  High impact, low duration, long recast time spells are where it is at.  The long recast delay means I will use the spells only when the capability gives me a decided advantage (i.e. only on an uber or close to uber encounter).  <P>The "normal" power curve for spell balance can be exceeded if the recast delay on the spell limits your ability to chain cast it.  Some examples are already in game: Dictate, Boon of the garou, Harvest, Dive Aura.<P>The wizards have a problem for instance in Velious - a full load of mana does nothing to the mobs in question.  Rather than go out and do a percent based DD, instead, create an insane damage to mana ratio spell that can only be cast infrequently.  Here's how to design the spell:<P>Figure out how much each class at a given level, when properly equipped, can do in terms of damage per minute.  <P>Determine where you want a wizard to fit in terms of damage per minute and call that X.  To make this work, it has to be on the low side of damage output capabilities for the various classes, but still a respectable amount of damage. <P>Figure out how much mana a wizard will regain per minute.  The calculation should have the wizard without claritied, without mana song and should include chain casting Harvest and meditating at all times.  Call the mana per minute Y.  <P>Create three DD spells with recast delay of 20 seconds, one each of fire, cold and magic.  Each spell does X/3 damage per cast and costs Y/3 mana to cast.  Cast times are commesurate with damage.  Mana efficiency of the spell is X/Y.  <P>In a long engagement, this gives the wizard a sustainable damage output while retaining some of their fast damage.  If they get clarity or bard song, the extra mana can be used to cast other damage spells.<P>The same technique can be applied to enchanters.  You don't want them to enchant mobs in Velious, that much is clear.  Instead, make short duration spells that have long recast times.  Make several of them.  MAKE THEM COMPELLING TO CAST.  Boon of Garou is a nice model, although I frequently get told not to cast it because the illusion effects make people sick when they are in werewolf form.<BR>Duration of these spells should be SHORTER than recast delay - they are one shot wonder drugs for who ever they happen to be on.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>How do you Enchanters respond to the idea of higher level roots like Enstill and Immobilize being given minimum durations.  This would take the form of mes, where the duration lasts a minimum amount of time without breaking (assuming it takes hold) unless the monster is damaged in any way.<P>That would add to crowd control (people try to use root for that right now anyway, sometimes it works) without stepping on Enchanter toes - especially since you get it too.<P>Bard mes should get another look too, in my opinion, since all it does is really piss off different random monsters at the bard.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I still see NO mention of the effect/utility of the Disempower/Debuff lines off spells that Enchanters as well as to a lesser extent Shamans and Necromancers get.<P>Right now there are Slow spells which are supremely usefull and then there are spells which strip away TONS of agility and strength from an npc which has no effect whatsoever.  The spells are devastating in PVP when they manage to land but are worthless in PvP battles.  It would go a long way to making Enchanters a useful part of an epic battle (assuming you stop making EVERY HIGH LEVEL MOB IN THE GAME MAGIC IMMUNE) if these debuff spells had a noticable effect on the mobs.<P>The Weaken Disempower etc spell lines are in the game now and are simply not used at all because they dont do a damn thing.  This would be an excellent time to look at those spells and re-evaluate them.<P>Another spell to look at might be Curse of the Simple Mind which is a useless waste right now but if its effect were changed to somehow prevent a proc (like a dragon breathing) or something similar for a SHORT period of time then Enchanters would AGAIN be very useful to a BIG encounter because their spells would be needed to keep the mob from unleashing huge damage attacks on the whole army.  <P>In essence making the DEBUFFS useful would make enchanters more than just buffers</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Well, 2 bards can do an admirable job of replacing a chanter.  In actual fact, 1 bard can, but let's not split hairs.  I have seen 1 bard control 3 extra mobs while I was linkdead.  Four or more would suck, but 3 was no problem.

If it gets no Spirit of Wolf component, then perhaps it could work indoors (it is currently outdoors only). <P>Spirit Wolf was removed from being indoor because it allowed chanters and droids to do CR on Vox and Nagafen raids pre-Kunark without risk.  I do not see this being made indoor again.  Nor do I see any justification for infringing on SoW.

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;ITEM: Undead Illusions.<BR>Chanters get charm, and can charm animals, undead, or almost anything else.  BUT, the chanter charm is less reliable than the druid and necro charm (per GZ).  It seems to me that the key is not whether we have the illusion, but the effects associated with them.  In the case of Necro "illusions", they carry with them the best self mana regen in the game.  In the Druid Wolf Forms, they carry SoW, faction, and maybe something else.  The chanter effects associated with these illusions are far less powerful in play.  Only when Verant staked out the spectre illusion for necros, and later the bear pet/illusion for shamans/druids did the issue of uniqueness come into play.  Then they promptly went off and made the one unique chanter illusion accessible to non-chanters via an item drop.  <P>I use illusions mostly for utility.  A faction boost to get where I can't otherwise go, an extra damage shield for the million times I get whacked, levitate, tiny regeneration boost, or EB.  Probably the thing that is MOST annoying to me about this is that the rules bend one way for other classes, but the other for chanters.  I.e.  "Let's give necros, shamans, and druids a form that chanters don't get, but let's give their unique form to a non-caster as an item effect.  Yeah, that's a great idea!" <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The anti-undead spell lines give the character back a message when he tries to cast on an invalid target, and the spells don’t even cast (costing the caster no mana or aggro). Perhaps this approach could be used for mez spells as well.<P>Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes.  Did I say Yes?  It would be nice to have the mob not aggro on me for casting a spell that doesn't even affect them (bad AI imo.  Why attack a creature that can't harm you when 10 tanks are beating you to death?

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;ITEM: The Essential Enchanter.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;DESCRIPTION: Some thought should be put into why an enchanter is considered ‘essential’ in a Kunark group, and perhaps change that. If this is determined to be a problem, then perhaps allowing some of the other classes to be better at the skills where they overlap with an enchanter (such as bards and crowd control...) would be a solution.<P>Oh, goodie.  A bard now can control 3 mobs while the group takes on a 4th.  I know this because I group with a couple bards a lot and both of them have done this when I went LD.  So what do you want em to be able to do?  4?  5?  If 2 shamans or druids are expected to be able to take the place of one cleric, the same test should apply to bards and chanters.  The fact is, 2 bards can more than take the place of a chanter.<P>Chanters are nice to have, but a bard and shaman or 2 bards, or a bard and necro can take a chanters place and add other benefits to the group to boot.<P>One more thing.  Chanters are crowd control.  It is the only thing they bring to the group that needs to be done more than once every 20 minutes.  If bards can replace them, why play a chanter?  Why not take a bard, with better melee, better survivability, better mana regen, charm, crowd control, better resist buffs, and the ability to speed and slow?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Let me tell you that you have not seen tash on post-50 uber mobs.  It matters not when you cast.  You cast, you die.  I waited once until the mob in question was at 60% health.  I tashed.  I died.  540 a pop 5 times makes you dead long before a cleric can heal you, Memory flux takes too long to cast, gets interrupted and won't channel, and works maybe 5% of the time, if that.  In short, you know not what you are talking about.  <P>&gt;&gt;&gt;Some MOB's don't MEZ ... GREAT remember root. <BR>The majority of the mobs in many zones don't mez because they are extremely high MR mobs, not because they are immune to mez.

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Simple. Because ‘crowd control’ is an area of gameplay the needs to be spread around to help groups in combat situations. <P>It is spread around.  What is not spread around TOO much is the Mez spell itself.  <P>- Necro's got one that is short duration, but affects mobs mez can't.  <BR>- Bards have sufficient mez capability to keep 3 mobs at bay.  <BR>- Root is the most prolific spell line in the game.  Virtually everyone has one form or another.  It is a crowd control spell against all pure melee mobs.  <BR>- SoW is a crowd control spell.  (Run the mobs around as is common in Fear)  <BR>- Complete Heal is a crowd control spell.  ( Have a tank cleic team tank an extra mob.)  <BR>- Stuns are crowd control spells, chain stuns (wiz, cleric, pally) all can keep single mobs at bay.  <P>I am SO tired of hearing about the "Essential Enchanter".  It is BS.  I see "looking for chanter/bard" too much to believe that chanters are indispensible. <P>Finally, let me make a point YET AGAIN.  MEZ DOES NOT KILL MOBS.  ENCHANTERS DO NOT KILL MOBS.  Their groups do.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have gotten really annoyed with these discussions on a few key things.<P>Enchanters are losing their supiority of Illusions over bards. We should at least have 1 unique illusions. Hell Shamans who get 1 illusion have the only unique illusion. <P>Also while I think bard's crowd control ability should be increase a bit you have to consider this. In most groups there is only room for 1 crowd control person, espically only 1 enchanter. Now you can have 1 bard and 1 enchanter or 2 bards, but there is No need whatsoever to have 2 enchanters in one group. If you give bards enough crowd control ability people will end up wanting 2 bards instead of 1 bard and 1 enchanter. My point is you have to be careful increaseing the bard power because making them stronger will have a serious side effect on Enchanters getting a group.<P>Also I seriously think you should rethink the Bard illusion item. I have no problem having them turn into other races but I think Elementals and Werewolves cross the line.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Things that arent on your list yet are important:<P>- level 54+ mesmerise spells and giant flagged creatures.<P>It is imho not unbalanced and makes the game more fun for everyone if the Glamour of Kintaz and Rapture spells would work on giant flagged creatures. The mana cost for these spells is enormous anyways, so it is already balanced. If it is not done, crowd control is simply done by slow/rooting mobs and putting a defensive style tank in front of it. That would reduce the enchanter to buffing only - which is boring, people choose this class for the danger and fun of crowd control only to see this ability taken away at high levels. Most people like to do difficult encounters with the least people they can because it is more challenging and fun that way, raids with a lot of people are boring (lots of buffs, people not listening, waiting a lot and total chaos of organising, most people are not in uber guilds etc.) Besides if big raids were in the vision there would be a way of sharing xp along the raid groups. Also the entire game engine is not even *capable* of handling big raids, the nature of the internet infrastructure and game engine makes it so that on big raids (more then 3 or 4 groups) people go linkdead and lag out a lot. So making these high level mezzes work on giant flagged creatures will help a lot.<P>- Distinction of unmezzable / 54+ spells requiring creatures.<P>A lot of creatures can vary in level around 54ish, for example the juggernauts in sebilis or the wanderers and golems in the hole. There is NO way of distinguishing which ones are and which ones arent mezzable by dazzle and lower spells. This is a huge BUG imho. Make the name of the creatures different (a 'lost wanderer' or a 'huge juggernaut' or a 'massive golem' something like that) while keeping the base data of the creature the same, maybe make the model a little bigger. <P>Also the creatures in the hole in for example the ghost city are an almost impossible encounter even with a huge force (huge forces only make lag and linkdeath worse). Ultra high repop and because of GoK and Rapture not working they are unmezzable. Either limit their level to 53- or do something else.<P>- High MR in Velious.<P>This has been said a number of times, an important issue. The old world and even kunark is *well balanced*, Velious however is not. It is a good thing however that you saw the error in sirens ghrotto and adjusted it somewhat.<P>Neferti<BR>Human beguiler<BR>Knights of the white rose<BR>Tallon Zek<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Some additional things I wish to mention:<P>Think about this first... fearkiting is one of the tactics you can use in the game, it removes all damage and danger (yes I do that too sometimes when Im bored and hunting in skyfire instead of in dungeons, mobs summon you but you can get a fear off and if you are with 2 people its easy).<P>Then think about this... mezzing that will get you summoned over and over if it breaks or resists - enchanters die first and most of all classes - no way to recast and it is not even able to be stuck on a giant flagged mob while fearkiting (and the necro mez) is??? (Yeah indeed root/slow does not work a lot of the time in Kael, Sirens Grotto and such.) Something is horrible wrong there. I thought the vision wanted you to group up in small groups and hunt deep in dungeons, not kite a mob and camp the zonelines and to throw as much bodies to an ubermob until it falls.<P>Another thing is, please give us armor with more AC. I have a loam encrusted robe but Id rather wear something that has no int, mana, cha or whatever but has like 20 ac or something. you gave necros such armors and they dont even need it, we do.<P>A lot of the points in that list are bugs by the way, not balance issues. And I dont care if I get any more illusions (spectre looks cool though  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">) it would be fun yes to recharge my allure or mana sieve wand with a potion of thicken mana or whatever, but it is not necessary. The mez problems however are necessary to be fixed.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Overall, I like the list, but there are two things I just have to disagree on.<P>1&gt; AC/HP.  We never asked "to have armor and hit points to match warriors".  At least, no one in their right mind did, can't comment on everyone.  If we wanted plate-level AC we'd be Bards.  What I'd like to see, personally, is instead of all this cloth-based INT-loaded stuff (of which there are now a ton of varieties available), offer us a leather-based set that increases HP, CHA, AGI, whatever.  We never asked for the durability of a Warrior.  We'd like the durability of a Druid.  And, realize that an Enchanter leather-based suit could be inferior in stats to a Druid suit, since part of the bonus could be justified by the higher AC.<BR>After all, you've already DONE this for Necros, they have available higher-AC armors already, and WE'RE the ones who are expected to take a beating.<P>Heck, if the Resplendent Robe's Rune gets changed to use no component (even if it gets downgraded to a self-only Rune III or something) it'd still solve most of this problem; the ability to self-buff before most fights with a protective shield would reduce the need for a high AC.  Of course, this only affects plane-level people, so maybe a new quest... for an item that casts Rune I (self-only, no component, longer casting time) at will?  If you made it look like a shield even the people complaining about illusions might like it.<P>2&gt; Religions/Faction.  This isn't just an Enchanter issue, but it's by far the clearest in our case, since we're the class that deals with faction the most, IMHO (Necros and SKs coming in right behind).<BR>Simply put, there are very few bonuses to having a good faction; once your CHA gets above a certain threshold (which varies with faction), you will receive the best prices as long as you're not KOS.  Since Enchanters tend to have ludicrously high CHA, we stopped paying retail at about level 20.  So, what does having a good faction in our hometown (the main use of religion, it'd seem) gain us?  By the time an Enchanter is willing to buy expensive items, faction has become a non-issue.<BR>The other bonuses of choosing a deity: imbued jewelry (most of these aren't very good, I'm sorry to say; the total bonus is unchanged, and the lack of resale value and difficulty finding imbuers of some gods outweigh any personal preference), imbued weapons/armor (doesn't affect non-HIE Enchanters)... not that impressive, IMHO.<P>The negatives of bad faction, on the other hand, are obvious.  My Agnostic friend casts Illusion: Iksar and walks right in the front door of Cabilis while the guards are indifferent, while in my case (follower of Quellious) the guards scowl, ready to attack.  Should religion make THAT much of a difference?  And if so, why does it only make me Amiable in my home town?<P>Suggested changes:<BR>&gt; Make deity have larger bonuses to "good" towns.  If an Agnostic is indifferent, a follower of Karana could be Amiable in all non-evil towns and Kindly in Qeynos.  Or (and I'd prefer this option, actually) decrease the penalty for having an unfavorable deity.  Following Quellious shouldn't take you from indifferent to scowls with the Iksar, in my view.<BR>&gt; Improve Imbued jewelry to have better TOTAL bonuses than mundane varieties, in the same way that imbued weapons and armor are superior to non-imbued.  This affects all classes equally, and gives more of a reason to not be Agnostic.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>So people, if I read the list, I can extract this idea :<BR>- increase chanters self power<BR>- decrease their indispensability in group<P>That is the worse idea I never heard about a massive multiplayer ROLEPLAYING game. Do chanters have to roleplay only with themselves in solo ?? Breeze and clarity make us accepted in groups (as a crack dealer  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ). This is fun. We are totally useless in Velious and by decrease our efficacity in group you are going to make this class TOTALLY useless everywhere. Please, don't do. What about cleric if you say that you would reduce their healing power to give more regeneration to everyone ? I don't think they appreciate !!

</FONT><HR>Groups in Kunark don't "need" enchanters.  Enchanters allow them to do more risky pulling and to be able to play without much need for strategic planning.  So the power gamers want the enchanter in their group so that they can optimize the amount of creatures they can kill, but they do not “need” an enchanter.  My guild often fights in Sebilis without an enchanter, the clerics and shaman root park creatures and everything is fine.  If a bard is along they can contribute as much or more than an enchanter.  In some ways it works better, bards, shaman and clerics can take a beating a lot better than an enchanter can.   Some areas would be hard to do without an enchanter, but they would be just as hard without a cleric or a fighter or insert situational class here.  Is this bad?  I do not think so.  I think the problem people are finding is that they perceive the “need” for an enchanter and then can’t find one because there are too few enchanters.  Perhaps the questions Verant should be asking is why are there not that many enchanters?  Enchanters are a situational class and you do not need too many of them to be effective.  Get four enchanters on a raid and two of them will be twiddling their thumbs a lot of the time.  In a lot of ways they are too situational.  If there is not the "need" for crowd control, then there is no "need" for an enchanter.  Make all the nerfs you are considering and soon an enchanter will not be able to find a group, just like when they were levels 1-28 (before breeze).    <P><BR>Enchanters really need more ways to enhance a group, so that when a group is fighting high MR critters or in a situation where crowd control is not an absolute necessity an enchanter has something they can do besides cast clarity and whatever their highest haste is. Frankly I would rather have a bard in the party for this.  At least he can do some damange when the fights start. <P>I would suggest to all enchanters reading this that you start experimenting with other classes, first for Velious and then for the lack of need for enchanters after Verant swings the nerf stick.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm kind of cuurious about this issue:<P>ITEM: Pet Positioning.<P>DESCRIPTION: Because enchanters can’t tell there pets where to go, they often get in the way. There is a tendency with all pets to stand right in front of their master. This is a bit of a pain when the caster is trying to target something, or just trying to see something. Can pets (all pets) default to standing behind their master?<P>STATUS: None<P>I haven't noticed this problem myself.  If the pet always stood in front of the caster, that would mean that every time the caster turns and looks a differrnt direction they pet would move.  This didn't seem right so I went and tested it a bit.  What I found (please note I only tried this in one zone, OOT, so the results could be wrong) is that my pet always stood to the north west of my position.  Sometimes this was in front of me, sometimes it was behind me, but always to the north west.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The pet positioning thing: I've noticed that they always seem to stand in one specific DIRECTION (northwest?).

</FONT><HR>First let me start by saying I’m very disappointed with the way these issues and ideas are presented. Some were added as if they are really important and others (yes – some I mentioned) were not included at all. Secondly, since this is the “final” list I’m very disappointed in the format it is presented. Anyone who debugs software for end use (and I do) presents their lists for enhancements in a numbered format for easier reference, so discussion and comment can be relayed in a more organized and abbreviated format. The end user will also prioritize these points low/med and high to give the developers some idea of importance to the users. Also programmers will usually assign a low/med/high difficulty factor to the items so the user knows how fast/easy an item could be implemented. This structure allows for items, once fixed or rejected, to be removed and remaining issues to remain visible and in order. For example all illusion issues should be of the same number and then alphabetized to keep them grouped nicely. This would allow Absor to come back and say the development team say’s, “Items 1, 3a, 4 and 7 and not possible at all from a programming perspective”. We could then remove them from our list and still talk about the remaining items in sequence.<P>1. DoT Pet.<BR>No one that I saw asked for this. We asked for our DoT’s to work better/faster. And in the case of SoV MOBs one not subject to resists.<P>2. Rampage<BR>Low priority<P>3a. Illusion, wolf.<BR>LOL – after 58 levels I finally get J-boots so sure give us SoW with this illusion, it figures. If not, let it work indoors. SoW – High priority / No SoW – Low priority.<P>3b. Illusion Race bug.<BR>Low Priority, except for PvP servers, but should be fixed.<P>3c. Undead Illusions<BR>Bite Me. I say we keep them.<P>4. Lull Spells – actually this is more of a clarification request of what this line of spells is actually suppose to be used for. Some think it is a “harmony” type spell. Some think it is as described, “Reduces the targets agro radius”.  However slight this difference is, it should I guess at this point be explained, as many enchanters seem to have no use for the line of spells. The nature of the spell line however, should have the benefit, that if resisted, a chance for no agro should result.<P>5. WTYH and DDD<BR>Whatever – I find this very low priority.<P>6a. Mesmerization – No mez flagged.<BR>Invalid target message after cast. Want it before cast to save the mana and agro. I’m afraid VI had this on purpose, within the “vision”, however, if their willing to change, fine. Make it a Medium priority.<P>6b. Mesmerization – Overwriting.<BR>Are single target mez’s suppose to overwrite AE mez’s? Guess we’ll wait to hear a response to this and what then?<P>6c. Mez (Charm) indicator.<BR>Low priority.<P>7. Low level evocation spell for practice.<BR>Would be nice. It was a fizzle nightmare at Level 8 to get our first evocation spell, considering all our DD spells are Evocation! DOH!<P>8.Tiny Daggers in Qeynos.<BR>Shrug – give them some.<P>9. Pet positioning.<BR>The description is all wrong. The pet is always in a position to the north (well whatever that direction is, but its always the same, learn to deal with it) of the enchanter. Nothing needs to be done here.<P>10. “Charm wear off”<BR>I have never noticed this, but if it’s broke, fix it. Medium priority, if broken.<P>11. Reoccurring Amnesia<BR>Medium Priority – Would be nice for it to work. I guess like a fire AE spell, three blasts in a row or something? Something needs to be done here.<P>12. Failure messages<BR>Yes these should work.<P>13. Mask of Faith<BR>This is plain BS. They chose a religion and now they can have some benefits from having a religion and enchanters want to mask it to eliminate some possible risks? ROFL. Fine then their needs to actually be spells for each religion and agnostic so agnostic enchanters can add the illusion of a religion where it would be helpful.<P>14. Cantana and Clarity Stacking Issue.<BR>I’ve never experienced this before and I cast clarity over a bard song all the time. Is this a PvP issue?<P>15. Blanket of Forgetfulness/Memory Flux<BR>The upgrade should work better. Period.<P>16. Collaboration<BR>I think it works fine. LOL – your faction is so poor in Skyfire that the critters there don’t want to like you no matter what. It’s mini-dragon country you know.<P>3d. Illusions and Link Death<BR>I think it would be nice to stay in illusion either when going LD or camping.<P>17. The Essential Enchanter.<BR>BITE ME YOU FREAKING LOSERS! HOW DID OUR CLASS THREAD GET HIJACKED AND WE GET NURFED. BITE ME ABSOR! BITE ME VI! YOU CHANGE THIS AND THERE WILL BE NO MORE ENCHANTERS POST 50!<BR>STOP BITING ON MISINFORMATION – KNOW THE GAME YOUR DEALING WITH.<P>18. Respendent Robe<BR>Sigh – this was to be a class balance talk and this fits more into a wish list, but whatever. I don’t think click able effects should use a component.<P>19. Rune IV<BR>Cheaper component? Do I get a refund for all money I spent casting Rune IV before, if this changes? BTW – they could have made Rune V a more expensive gem but didn’t, think of it that way. Also if they change to two different gems we have to carry more gems now or can they allow Rune V to be cast on any level person so we wouldn’t have to carry gems to cast Rune IV on lower level people.<P>20. Tash line Agro.<BR>I don’t want this to change. I can control most situations because I know how a MOB will react to this spell.<P>21. Rune line Agro.<BR>This would be nice to have the agro removed from or at least looked at. It does seem to agro a great deal. Specifically if you use it to save someone’s life during a fight.<P>22. Recast bug on fast spells.<BR>Fix it.<P>23. Global Mana Regen Idea.<BR>ANOTHER HIJACK! I HATE YOU FREEKING LOSERS THAT WANT TO ELIMINATE ENCHANTERS FROM THE GAME. BITE ME! /BOGGLE<P>24. Mircyls Animation icon bug.<BR>Another class balance idea? Doh! Just fix it.<P>25. Visions of Grandeur<BR>Reduce recast time? Sure make it easier for the ubers when there are 20 other spells I could think of at a lower level that need their recast times reduced.<P>6d. Dazzle (49) and Glamour (54)<BR>Simple, Glamour should overwrite Dazzle. All spells of the same line should have the higher version overwrite the lower version. The spells of the same level should overwrite each other too, if cast by different enchanters regardless of their respective levels. Such that a level 49 enchanter casting dazzle should be able to stack on a lvl60 enchanter’s cast of dazzle.<P>26. Umbra<BR>This needs to be a real upgrade. Doh!<P>27. Enchant med. Quality Ore.<BR>How this get on a class balance thread.<P>28. Pet control.<BR>I find my pet very controllable, just not commandable. I guess if I was to wish for a command it would either be /back off or /be gone.<P>Now we go into the section Absor call future use. A wish list if you will. These will be numbered separately. Will they be brought up in the dev team talks?<P>1. Phantom Armor<BR>Yes – would be a cool one.<P>2. Group Rune.<BR>I think this is a great idea and probably should be moved to the list above. Why can clerics use one periodot and cast group shield and we can not at any level cast a group rune. Heck, I would use a star ruby for group rune if I could get it.<P>3. Enchanting Items.<BR>Rangers have a form of it, so it’s very doable.<P>4. Religion<BR>Whatever – some religions have advantages already, give them more if that’s possible.<P>5. Thicken mana.<BR>Come on these spells have been in the game forever, can’t you come up with something creative to use them for?<P>6. Targeting<BR>Whatever, I have little problem now. I wouldn’t see a need for this feature.<P>7a. Illusion Gender<BR>I really don’t put this high on my illusion wish list.<P>7b. Illusion, Group<BR>This would be high on my illusion wish list.<P>7c. Illusion, Change size<BR>A medium priority on the illusion wish list.<P>7d. Illusion monster (copycat)<BR>This would be high on my illusion wish list. You prove to me that casting an illusion removes the base faction of the player to the MOBs. I say prove it to me first.<P>7e. Major Illusion<BR>Well make it Level 60 and I doubt many will use it. A low priority for me.<P>7f. Illusion Face<BR>A random face of your own race or stack with other racial illusions? If my race only then low priority. Stackable with other racial illusions I would make this medium.<P><BR>Well that sums it up for Abosrs list. Over 50% I see as fixes and or wishes and have nothing to do with balance. Here are the things I wanted to add balance to my class and they didn’t make the list, LOL, but the rest of this crap did.<P>1. A bigger direct damage.<BR>Hey, all you “Essential enchanters” may want one of these now that you wont be doing CC in Kunark any more. Thanks for sitting on your butts sucking up exp and thinking you were playing your defining roll, all you did was made us weaker with the potential nurfs. Throw a nuke now and then or a DoT and show people you are a well-rounded class. Freaks.<P>2. Self-only mana regen.<P>3. Faster recast on ToT or another one for more mana at a higher level.<P>4. All charms and mez’s should be fixed duration and progressively better from 49 on.<P>The rest I’m drawing a blank on so go back and look at my previous post, because I’m getting to tired of writing.<P>Finally just let me add that since you didn’t bring up Magic resistances in Velious I see there will be no progress here until the uber get done farming it. All I will say is: <P>BITE ME!<P>ROFL and to think I almost wanted to put in for one of your QA jobs!

</FONT><HR>I don't know if this is intentional or not but it seems the Illusion tree and minor illusion might be possibly broken.  These spells cast fine, however there seem the be an issue with faction.  <P>I was in nek Forest and needed to med, being kos to the guards, I cast Illusion tree yet was still attacked by the first wandering guard.  <P>I understand other "monster" illusions making you kos as the guards do kill wolves or skeletons etc, but the guards do not go around hacking every tree or coin they see.  Why do guards/monsters see your faction through an inanimate object illusion?  I dont see this as an exploite issue since these illusions render you rooted.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000774-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000774.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000774-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000774-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000774-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000774&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000774&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
