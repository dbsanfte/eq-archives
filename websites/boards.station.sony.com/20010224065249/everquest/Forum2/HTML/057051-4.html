</FONT><HR>I just want fairness from this next adjustment to our class, nothing more.  I want my current spell line to hit with the same chance of success/failure as any other caster of the same level/skill.  I also want my pet to be nearly to a mage pet (not equal to because they are supposed to have the most powerful pets).  Revise the level 53 and 56 pets to be simple linear improvements (hp/ac/dmg/warrior based) from the 49 pet.  I also want my 50+ spells and class specific items to be just as easily found as loot drops as any other class.  They should also think about taking away our mana transfer ability and giving it to shamans which more sense for them to have it in the first place.  Mana transfer has absolutely nothing whatsoever connected to dead/undead (necro) skills, but falls right in line with shaman cannabilize and buffing others, maybe even improve that by group mana transfer for shamans...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A thought or two...if you're going to make necros into a support class, give us some powerful support spells.<P>For example, some have suggested we get boon of the garou, or a targetable version of vampiric embrace.  A variation on this:<P>Spell: Negative Energy<BR>- mana cost: 400 (tenative figure only -- obviously we can only estimate what the overall effect, and thus the necessary mana cost, might be in a variety of situations)<BR>- duration: 3 minutes<BR>- causes two effects on the targeted party member:<BR>  - Lose 25 hp per tick<BR>  - Proc a 150 point disease-based lifetap off the primary hand.  Proc rate would result in about 4 per minute given a delay of 20, FBSS haste, and a dexterity of 100.<P>- does not stack with boon of the garou (for obvious reasons)<BR>- Possibly make the spell castable on players only to eliminate soloing concerns<P>The total potential this spell would have at the given proc rate would be to tap 1800 hps over 3 minutes and lose 750, net effect +1050 hps on the tank.  However, in a normal group, not all battles will be 3 minutes long; many may be 1-2 minutes.  Consequently, the total tap may very well be around 900 hps, which helps the tank very little as he still loses 750 hps to the spell.<P>Of course, with haste and dex buffs, the spell could become very powerful.  This requires, however, that you group with said classes in addition to the tank, and healer, etc.  Synergies are good in what is primarily a grouping game.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>The key effectiveness of this spell would come in raids, where shaman and enchanters are almost guaranteed to be present.  Additionally, ubermob fights are also likely to last a decent length of time (especially those in velious).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hello,<P>I play alot of different classes, but my necro is my main now ( though I may be playing my 23 warrior or 25 ranger more after the changes... ) I almost always group. I dont know about playing past 50, which seems to be the largest complaint, but I do know that necros could use some improvement stricly in a group enviroment ( If I have sow on, I can solo without any worrys...I think even better than a druid of similar level ). <P>At 35 mobs tend to drop in between 15-30 secs. DOT's are usesless. I dont even do 50% of my damage with Boil. VOS does 40 dam and a bit more. I still cast Heart Flutter for the debuff componant. Mostly I cast a darkness, then Fear it if we are outdoors. Then med. or cast HF. I may blast off a couple of Torbas but usually by the time I dark and fear the mob is 25% anyway. To keeep my health up I will cast Vampiric Curse while I have COB up. Sometimes fear is a pain, so I dont cast that and just dark, hf, one blast maybe then med. This is a partial to full group scenario.<P>So how much damage am I doing? very little. The fear does the most good because I take alot of pressure of the clerics, but indoors this is deadly. Otherwise, all my spells work best solo or with a partner.( a necro and a druid or tank seems to work the best )<P>Basically, my biggest beef is that we dont get any really "group friendly" spells.<P>My suggestions:<P>1)Make some "group only" spells that do some serious damage quickly, but only in a group. A 30 sec DOT that does say 50dam per group member at 29,+5 dam/level...so a lvl30 necro in a group of 6 would do 330dam in 30sec... upgrades through to 60 of course<P>2)Group lifetap. Take 600hp from target, give 100 to every group member at 34 or 39. Make a manatap to match. ( 300 mana from target, 50 mana to every group member)<P>3)Take a look at the Scent series. Takes too long to cast, takes too much mana, and is resisted too much. Pretty much goes unused. I only use it when the group is VERY caster heavy ( like one tank )...<P>4)I like the Group FD idea. That alone would make us more group friendly, especially in dungeons. <P>5)A "anti-Fear" buff, "Bravery of the Dead" or something. Cast it on tanks to significantly improve their Fear resistance.<P>6) I spend alot of time outside where I can run around, because I can always bum/buy a sow and kite. So something to make Necros want to spend more time in dungeons, and make them more wanted in groups. Call it the "Underworld" series.  A spell that is group only, Indoors only that does some serious damage or debuff or something. Like group harmtouch, or stun. <P>7) Pets become less and less significant as the levels go up. Maybe a Pet Burnout for necros That causes the pet to do crits and crippling blows...but dies at the end of the spell. A last resort spell....<P>8) Nerf lich and get rid of the mana transfer. If I wanted to "heal" mana I would have been an enchanter or cleric. Giving mana is too "nice". Necros arent nice....<P>I like my necro. In a pinch I can do just about anything. I can heal, I can snare, I can root, I can mana transfer, DOT, and DD. But I cant do any of those things better than another class. That, I believe, is what is the core of why they are not as sought after at higher levels. At Higher levels you need a full group(or multiple groups) to do stuff. Necros dont have a "niche" so to speak, so give us one.<P>Or I can just play my Warrior :P<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I already posted my views on most things having to do with necros but i will recap them here:<P>1.  Leave lich alone.  Or if you must fix it, move demi lich down to 55 and make archlich 60 with a ratio either equal to or better than lich is now.  Understand that by changing this spell, you are altering one of the Necros core abilities that affect soloing AND grouping post 50.  If this spell becomes as efficient or less efficient than Clarity or Clarity 2 there is a very good chance that necros wont use it.<P>2.  Life Drain.  We need a way to gain back life in the long battles with uber mobs.  I cannot use lich if my cleric or druid has to worry about healing me or regrowing me in the middle of combat.  I need to be able to heal myself so i can funnel mana to those that need it.  This is YOUR Vision of a Necromancer's role, not ours.  You need to allow us the capacity to DO what you ENVISION us doing.<P>3.  Trepidation (Invoke Fear upgrade).  Same spell as Invoke, with same resists, and break rate and costs 100 more mana.  Please make this spell worth having.<P>4. Night only spells.  Could you give me specific examples as to where a Necro would be severely overpowered if he could cast a fixed duration invis during the day (Skin if the shadow)?  Or burn 500 mana for Levant during the day?  And my favorite, Quivering Veil, this is supposed to be an upgrade to Harmshield.  How is it an upgrade if I can only cast it half the time?  Raids arent day or night dependant, I need a spell that i can use in a bad situation to buy me some time.. since I never know when that bad situation will be, why would I mem a spell that may leave me hanging when I need it?<P>5.  Essence Emerald spells.  Convergence is great.  A great idea, a life for a life.  However, why is it so overpowering to be able to give 1100 mana to myself every 15 min, or be able to do an 1100 life drain every 15 min (except on the Bosses which are 100% RESISTANT to Life Drain) without an essence emerald.  Make it an expensive gem that is at least attainable.  Keeping spells this way only paves the way for essence emerald farming off of characters power leveled specifically for the purposes of sacrificing.  No one wants to lose exp in this game.. especially at high levels where one death costs between 3 and 4 hours of work. Oh wait, we ARE paying you for that time aren't we, heh?  Was this part of your vision?<P>6.  Pets.  I understand mages are the ultimate pet casting class.  But at the higher levels are our pets supposed to be so disparate in power?  A 60 mage pet can tank a 55 warrior with plane gear and win.  A 60 Necro pet is no where near what a mage pet is in hitpoints, or damage output.  I do not want to be better than a mage, I just want to be close enough to them in pet power to be able to deal with Kunark and Velious mobs with a pet that has more hitpoints than I do.  I don't want to be as powerful as a mage with my pet, I just think the disparity between our pet power is too great.  In addition, why are Necromancer pets, who in popular literature are immune to most forms of fear not immune to some AoE fears in this game.  Heck, you gave that ability to mages, and our highest level pet, the Emissary of Thule (as in Cazic Thule, as in GOD OF FEAR) is not immune to fear at all.  Make at least our ultimate pet immune to fear, or take the peridot casting component away from it. Make it 3 or 4 bonechips or something.  Heck just giving us back the delay modifiers for weapons on our pets would be nice.<P>7.  Epic Weapon.  Is garbage.  It is laughed at by the other classes (the Duckhead) and the effect is useless by the time you can get it.  Please make the weapon look more fearsome, and change the effct to something useful like a nice Bond of Death type spell or maybe a componentless Life Drain DD spell (Trucidation)  =)<P>Absor, I have been around since almost the inception of this game.  I have seen the Necromancer class go from god status to gimp status.  I understand that in the old world Necros were way overpowered.  Pets hitting faster than hasted monks for 70+ damage a hit.. etc, etc.  But with the creation of Kunark and Velious, and a more powerful group of mobs to deal with, the Necromancer class really needs some enhancements to bring them back into at least contention with the other classes.  I know the tendancy is to nerf, not to enhance, and the necro class has always been seen as super powerful, but I urge you to look, REALLY LOOK, at the necro's strength today as compared to some of the other classes of today.  I appreciate your time and attentiveness to the opinions of your player base.<P>Shaithis Deathwalker<BR>55th lvl NecroGnomicon of Tunare  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You guys are missing the point. As far as verant is concerned, Necromancers are overpowered, Period.<P>As the begining of the thread suggest, we can expect a nerf to lich in exchange for, mabe, a unresistable tap, mabe.<P>These are really the only two viable options being considered. Anything to do with targetable mana transfer is pretty much useless, considering the cost.<P>So...inorder to do a very small amount of damage to an uber mob, our solo ability will be nerfed considerably.<P>Further more, consider youself as the leader of a group in sebillis, you thing a low dmg, high mana tap will make you anymore desirable?<P>You will still be alone, in skyfire, medding longer now because of a unresisted lifetap upgrade.<P>I have really enjoyed my necro till 50, i bored myself to death to get to 55, and then said a sad goodbuy to my necro.<P>i still enjoy EQ playing another class, but my necromancer is retired. I didnt buy a multiplayer game to sit on the bench, waiting till the last team has been picked, hoping there might be a slot for me. Necromancers Dont Beg. <P>There will be no significant changes to the class untill Alan does a /who all necromancer 55 60 on all the servers and can count them on  one hand. And watch, when he does, he will say, whats wrong with the class guys?<P>                     Lebie of the Rathe<BR>                     Necromancer 55 Retired</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Busy casters don't have time to report mana.  You already have the graphics/programming mechanism to do it (the new XP bar).<P>Please also consider the following:<BR>1.

</FONT><HR>I've had my say on them making necros group friendly earlier but last night I grouped with 5 others for the first time. The only thing I found myself ablle to do to contribute was to buff myself add VE and  combined with my pet bevome a mini tank. At lvl 18 thats sad...<P>Also on the balance issue why is necro the only class that i see that has to go invisible in FP to go to the bank, the wharf and their guild because there are npc's camped around there who will KoS you not to mention all npc druids etc in open areas. I would have thought that alone would have balanced us up a fair bit.<P>Druids can go from FP to HH with about 70% of things leaving them alone Everything will attack a necro even greens sometimes.<P>I would have thought that evened things out a fair bit if we are overpowered as you claim.<P>You say you play a high lvl necro I for one doubt if you have played it in a long time and maybe someone there should start one again untwinked and try it now and no grouping with the other testers to make you feel wanted.<P>Me i have started a SK that way i will get all the good necro stuff and better by the looks of it plus more.<P>Just be honest and take necros of the create a character screen like you really want.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I half expect my party members to laugh at me, start cooing, and say "Awww, look at the little Necro trying to help. He's so cute." Sitting down, and meditating for other casters must have been omited from the class description when I created this character. I'm sure I wouldn't have missed something like that.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>HAHA...Most of you guys have fallen for Absors diabolical plan. As long as he doesn't nerf Lich the majority of you are going to sigh in relief and count yourselves as lucky.<P>Seriously guys, I'm sure Absor and VI are really looking very carefully at this issue and we need to back off the fear of the Lich nerf and give Absor what he really needs to make us better...ideas to improve our class.<P>What I've seen so far on test server for other classes is really well thought out changes to other classes and I really don't think VI is going to decimate Necs when in reality the changes I have seen being considered for other classes have been mostly very positive. In fact, I really think VI has taken a decided turn for the better in dealing with group balancing of the other classes so far.<P>There will be plenty of time to rant and rage if we feel the changes VI makes really make us suck as Necs, (like we don't already post 50?). But, for now I think it is in our best interest to approach this with a calm demeanor and suggest what we feel is positive suggestions. If I were Absor I probably would have stopped reading this thread long ago simply to end the agony of hearing 1 more rant against changes that have not even been made or decided on. And, these rants are obscuring some of the excellent posts that REALLY need to be seen by Absor.<P>How bout everyone taking one last stab at listing a few ideas to end this dicussion on a positive note and if the changes made don't please us we will raise holy hell then instead of now.<P>The best ideas I have heard so far to help us out are:<BR>Unresistable Taps<BR>Targetable taps<BR>Upgrade to FD<BR>Short duration DoTs </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If we are trying to find a role for the necromancer at 50+ without increasing the abilities of the necromancer to solo... perhaps we should consider increasing the line of mez spells that the necromancer has.<P>When my buddy (a necro) and I group with parties, we often play the role of enchanter using screaming terror to mez a pull of multiple mobs.<BR>The spell itself is not terribly effective and an improvement in this line of spells would allow necromancers to assist the enchanters in the role of crowd control during big raids.<P>To prevent this line of spells from being used in conjunction with the necromancer's pet (the true source of our power) simply make it like the undead charm series... which do not function when a pet exists.<P>I personally would feel a fulfilling role if I could participate in this capacity.. rather than merely sitting down and giving my mana away, petless, doing nothing.<P>As a necromancer we could do through fear, horror and loathing what the enchanter does through awe and inspiration.  <P>-- Zarc</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

If 3 targets, then each target would be hit for 110, etc.<P>Lastly, if my own Neriak guards will attack me when I am in skel form, then we should get positive faction or reactions from NPC undead.

</FONT><HR>"If you want Necros to assist in mana distribution, we need the tools to do it..."<P>Noooooooooo :-)<P>I do not believe we necros should give in on this one.  We are not 3rd rate mana batteries.<P>We *should* be damage machines.  Isn't that what most of us made our characters to be?  I was under the impression when I made my necro, that a wizard might be able to pump out huge amounts of damage in a very short time to end a bad fight, and I couldn't do that, but that over the long haul I as a necro could contribute more damage than the DD based classes.<P>Nice in theory!  In practice my 1 to 2 minute DOT spells do 20 to 30% of their total damage, leaving them far less efficient than wiz or mage nukes.  My pet is only usable in limited circumstances.  I cannot nuke as well as a cleric or enchanter on normal mobs.  On boss mobs where wizzies are underpowered due to being mana-limited, I can do NO damage AT ALL.<P>No amount of persuasion is going to convince me that necromancers, masters of the forces of life and death, evil begins feared and hated by all, are meant to sit and meditate for other casters who can actually do something with the mana.  Who ever said that was our role in the world?<P>I would look with great shame upon the necromancer class if that is what we become.  I play my class to the fullest of its abilities and my own ability to get from it all that I can.  I just fear that in the end, there will be nothing *to* get from it.<P>scr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

At least then I am not a total waste, and the guild feels obligated to include me on the raids.<P><BR>I would ask that we be made more group feasable please.  When I started this character almost 2 years ago I was told that the necro class was one of the harder classes to play.  It should have read that if you want to be a solo class take necro because groups will be slim.<P>Just got seb keys not to long ago.  Not sure why it is sooooo hard to get a necro into a group.  Not just seb   but anywhere.<P>I play to have fun.  Playing by yourself for long periods makes you bored and burned out on the game.

</FONT><HR>I've been a keen follower of the necro threads over the last year, and have often heard more experienced necros speak of their futility post 50.<BR>I am now a level 52 necro on Luclin, and I can share wholeheartedly these concerns.<P>I share here, my experience on a Vox raid yesterday, which I hope will illustrate the impotence of necro's in the post 50 world.<P>The raid could be split in to the following stages: preparation, clearing the yard trash, the main encounter and finally recovery and flight.<P>Preparation:<BR>I only had one buff to give people - I am not a support class per se so I had no problems with this. But buffing 50 people is tedious. Why no group DMF buff? It makes zero difference to the balance of the classes, just makes like post 50 slightly easier.<P>Clearing the Yard Trash:<BR>The resist rates of the Ice Giants is unbelievable, I may as well not have been there at all. Using my Ignite Bones spell was not an option because of the targetting problems it causes the melee classes in battle. Being a necro, I am a pure caster (right?) - after a few Ice Giants I stopped casting altogether - there was no point.<P>Main encounter:<BR>After waiting until the order for the casters to get busy, I ran bravely to the heart of Lady Vox, close enough to tough her undersides, and started to cast. I wasn't really expecting any DOT's to stick at all - having been forewarned by fellow necros about our impotence - but when I am touching Lady Vox and I can't even Drain Soul her - what am I to do? Load up a rusty spoon and improve my 1hb?<P>Recovery:<BR>Pump mana and summon corpses. Repeat ad infinitum.<P>In summary -<BR>Prep: DMF x 50<BR>Clearing yard trash: no impact<BR>Main encounter: no impact<BR>Recovery: mind numbing boring<BR>Overall: no impact - no effect - no enjoyment<P>Why are the life taps so resisted? Who is frightened of 40 necros coming along and lifetapping uber_mob01 to death? Our Drain Soul doesn't do anything like Ice Comet - and is not in any way mana efficient - it just wouldn't happen just like 40 wizards wouldn't ever consider tackling uber_mob01.<P>Will I consider another Dragon raid? No.<BR>Do I feel somewhat cheated? Yes<P>Post 50 Necro life is not nice.

</FONT><HR>Thanks for the fun Verant.  Here is a post I made to my guild this morning.  Read it and know you have ruined not only mine and alot of other high level necro's fun.  Please do something to help us.  <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Unless things change I will get 60 with Bralan and retire him except when needed. I told Ony to put me last on the Sleeper's key list. The only reason I will get 60 is because I said I would and dont want to be a quitter.<P>I love the necro still in a single group setting. But on the raid level they have reduced the necro to a shell of the class I leveled for a year and a half. I used to be the master of damage. Could solo stuff some groups could not(still can but who cares). Now on the fights we fight on a daily basis my spells dont stick, my pet gets feared, and I just do my best to stay alive.<P>What is my roll? Simply to feed mana. Yea that is a good thing to cut down on down time but that is not the class I started. If I wanted to be a class related to mana I would have started an enchie or a bard. I wanted to deal damage, have a bad assed pet and contribute. The way it turns out absolutely nothing I do nor any decision I make during an encounter makes any difference at all. I med to give someone else mana. Quite frankly it sucks. It's boring as hell and it's not what I want to do in a game I play to supposedly have fun at. <P>I will play to 60 but will be switching to my monk or rogue. I can't decide which I enjoy more. I enjoy the pulling aspect of the monk but don't think I could ever be on Koryo's level so dont know what the point there is except to just tool around in Lguk for fun. The rogue deals good damage and is also fun to play. So chances are I will work on my rogue the most when I am done with Bralan.<P>In all honesty I just can't wait for a new game. My necro has been forced into a secondary roll of suck ass. And I dont know if I can bare the monotony of leveling another class that high in levels without help.<P>Who knows. Maybe Verant will get their collective heads out of their asses and make some changes that will bring the necro back to the end game. Til then I will grudgingly be working on 60. 3 more yellow bubs to go.<P>Bralan <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think the reason why necro's are getting complains is becuase post 50 they are difficult to use.  A necros strengths come from a pet, fear, and dots.  All three of those can not be used in high level encounters.  Pets are too dangerous due to pathing.  Fear is too dangers due to agroing other mobs.  And Dots are too risky becuase they agro the caster, and may make a corpse go poof.  It's really annoying to be standing in a large room with your pet a few steps in front of you, walk backwards, then see your pet take off in the opposite direction, taking the longest path back, and agroing the entire room in the process.  Above that, your pet can be 10+ levels below you, so expect it to fight mobs that would otherwise stand still.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
