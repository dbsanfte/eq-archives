</FONT><HR>I personally love the idea of having berseker frenzy on a hotkey. It would add some more interaction and it could be fun as well, more than once I've been on a group with a paladin, and when things got quite ugly I've noticed the paladin doing a LoH and bringing up hope for the group. As someone previously mentioned(forgot who.. *scratches his head*), berseker frenzy should be something like that, it shouldn't mean "Crap, time to evac" but "A-ha! we're saved!!".. *g*.. well.. not saved, but at least have more of a chance to survive. It would also be nice to get an increased chance of crits/crips when doing this, since you would not be able to use the ability all the time, unlike fighting below 2 bubs of health all the time, and you'd have to figure out a way to determine when to do crips and when to do crits.. what else. Ah, AoE taunt. I love the idea. To the people who say it's too risky, I've experienced MANY situations where this could have helped. Remember, I believe we're asking for this as a NEW taunt, not as one that completely replaces our standard one-target taunt, so you wouldn't be forced to use it. Just like AoE spells. I'd like some taunt enhancement as well, and bind wounds? I've allways hoped for Verant to let us bind wound up to %60-%75.. I'd just love that. I -know- we are not a solo'ing class, but it has happened to me, logging in and trying to find a group in several different zones for an hour, only to log out and log in my necromancer who's parked at EC and play around with the inkies (I'm from Tallon Zek). By the way, my necro is just level 13 and I honestly prefer the warrior, all the way.. hehe. I'm not asking to be made a soloing class. I'm asking to have a soloing chance. HP regeneration for warriors at higher levels would also be nice, but I understand that you might not want to do this. PLEASE add something for the 35-50 levels. Weapon specialization sounds really, really nice. Specialize in one type of weapon (one handed swords, maces, etc) and have maybe a bit more damage with it and a lesser chance to miss.<P>Well, I think that's all I can think of at the moment.<P> Bheeffo<BR> Dwarven Warrior on my 30th Season<BR> Tallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oh yeah, just remembered.. for the people asking for the ability to stun at pre-55 levels, try Ghetto Bashing. Just hotkey an inventory slot next to yer secondary weapon slot, and switch the items quickly when you need to bash. It works wonders, but only with 1h swords. That's why I'd like to ask for the ability to hold 2h swords in the secondary slot instead of primary? (obviously, without the ability to hold anything on the primary).. since there seems to be a damage modifier for the primary hand, this would have to be looked at.. but it'd be a nice adition for small races who'd like to stun.<P>Race abilities sound great. A new skill on the kick timer sounds good as well, those suggestions, pin, headbutt.. heh.. all that stuff is interesting.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P> Bheeffo<BR> Dwarven Warrior on my 30th Season<BR> Tallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yeah, I know, three posts in a row is pretty sad. But I keep reading all the suggestions and I'd like to make a comment on them.<P>Equiping a shield on the back slot. Sounds good. A small AC increase, wich warriors are asking for, and it makes shields really useful. <P>A timed ability to run quickly for a short while, while burning up stamina. Warriors are notorious for not having any escape routes. Indeed it is sad that warriors getting jumped by green mobs while travelling can be their doom. The idea of a skill/hotkey that would allow us to burn our stamina for a burst of speed, in order to escape, sounds really good. Make it a 30 minutes refresh time or something, or whatever you find that would work.. sounds good to me, really. I can't think of anything else at the moment, but I'm sure I will in a while. *g*<P> Bheeffo<BR> Dwarven Warrior on my 30th Season<BR> Tallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I know I could think of something else..<P><BR>As someone previously mentioned, some way to increase our skills faster. No one told me I should train most if not all weapon skills until my mid twenties.. try training any weapon skills you're not good at against the mobs you have to fight in order to get any skill at all.. it is quite frustrating and boring really. The damage output and our taunt ability is cut off by too much, I'm not saying that it shouldn't be that way, but that it'd be nice to have some other way to train our skills. Indeed, casters do have the ability to cast their spells on themselves or their pet in order to increase their casting skills. Training dummies or something of that sort to bring our skills at least to an average level would be really appreciated.<P>*scratches his head* what else.. what else.. must think of something else..<P>ah, since there seems to be a lot of experienced warriors here, I'd like some input if possible on alcohol resistance/alcohol use in battle? mine's at 150 but I never really found it useful for combat.. it is true.. I've barely had anything else other than mead.. so I'm not sure if I'm missing something. If not, having this useful in combat would be a nice twist.<P>Hmm.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>There are 2 main things I see wrong with the Warrior class.<P>  1st is the lack of HP/AC.  It is to the point where we have a hard time fighting low blues w/o the loss of a good deal of HP.  This wouldn't be such a big deal if it didn't take so long to get it all back.  There isn't always a healer around your level willing to group.  I think Warriors need one of 3 things, more HP, more AC, or a faster HP regain rate.<P>  2nd is a big lack in things to do, we don't get moves like a Monk, we can't be sneaky like a Rogue, and we don't get any spells.  I was thinking of a few skills that could be added & would really help let the class do something in the mid. of a fight.<BR>    - Multi Target Attack, this has all ready been said in other posts.<BR>    - A Running Attack, This would have to be used at a rang.  Once pressed the Warrior would run at the target at a very high speed doing 3 or 4 times the normal dmg as well as knocking the target back.<BR>    - Agro Attack, Mobs can go argo on players, why not the other way.  Once a war presses the key to go argo they attack faster, do more dmg, & have a kind of auto follow on the target.  The draw back is they CAN NOT target anything new until their target is dead.<BR>    - Vengeance, This is much like argo attack, but only takes effect if one of your party members is kill.  The added attack speed and stats are only added when attack the mob that killed you group member.<BR>    - Dual Wield 2 Handed, This was also said before, but I would like to add a little to this.  Most Warriors go to 2hs or dual wielding 2 1hs.  If this was let into the game it would fix the idea that Warriors could use a dmg boost, as well as get 2hs users to work on their dual wield skill.  Now I know what you are going to say; What about 1hs users?  Well as long as they hit much faster then the 2hs users, they should be fine, it would also be just as easy to move from 1hs to 2hs as it would be to move from using one weapon to two.<BR>    - Command, This skill when used would raise the stats of everyone grouped with the Warrior, but only for so long.<BR>    - Holding, The Warrior can't attack or move when using this skill.  To top that, it has a very short range.  Is what the skill does is it roots the target, slows it's attacks & lowers its stats.<BR>    - Last Strike, This takes effect when the player is "killed".  This will not work if the Warrior is knocked out or if the Warrior is kill by a spell.  When the mob takes its killing swing, so does the Warrior.  The better the skill the more dmg that last hit does.  If the Warrior's last strike kills the target the Warrior get 5% of his HP back & doesn't die.<BR>    - Chant, This will make any bard's songs in the group have a stronger effect.<BR>    - Battle Cry, This is an AE stun.<P><BR>  Naska<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>About the bind wounds. You say you don't want to add stuff that will make it easier for a class to solo. Yet a patch or two ago you made a major change in how root and snare interact.  Basically you make it even easier for dr00d$ to solo by snaring, then rooting then dotting with even less danger than they previously had.  I have a 36 druid, I know how much easier it got.<P>You might argue you were fixing something that was already in the game, but not working as intended.  Well, bandaging to 200 is in the game already for monks.  Somehow they aren't easier to solo because of this, but warriors would be?  There is some sort of disconnect there.<P>And why do warriors want to solo?  It's not for the fast exp.  Bind wounds changes wouldn't make it faster to solo exp than to group exp.  It would simply make it possible to solo. It wouldn't make all the warriors give up dungeon groups so they can power level.  It would give them something to do when they only have an hour, and happen to be logged out in one of a very few locations that a warrior can solo.<P>I find your quick answer to this issue very unsettling.  Maybe if you changed the description of a warrior in the manual to "For those people who want to do all of their adventuring in a group" I could get behind you.  I knew I would have to group most of the time - EQ is built that way.  I didn't realize I was gonna have to group 99.5% of the time. It may be a lost cause, but please rethink your refusal on this issue.<P>And don't forget to do somethign about the stupid troll helm visual bug! I think that is one of the reasons most trolls are cranky - we get cross-eyed from seeing that trash on the screen every time we swing!!!<P>Cordelia<BR>Trollop Champion</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Where do I start..<P>#1 thing tuant.  Why at 51 am I getting out tuanted by a lvl 49 Ranger? hmm seems odd to me..<BR>I use two different weapon combo's to test it.. <BR>a Viik's Dark Defender / Cane of Tranquil<BR>and<BR>Wurmslayer / Viik's Dark Defender<P>both using fbss and here are the two major problems I see...<P>I barely hit my target 50% of the time.<BR>I can barely tuant the target off anything and my group usually has to wait till I get the mob to 1/4th before they can even start attacking post 50 or one blast of IC and he is eating the Wizzy for lunch..  this needs major fixing.<P>My second issue is our bind wound skill, not only do monks deal more damage, have a mend wound to heal but they can also bind wound to 75%.. warriors get high ac which I play both a high level monk and high level warrior and see no real difference in damage taken, but I do see a high level difference in the speed of recovery and the damage inflicted between a monk and a warrior.. for mobs that do 200point of damage a tick.. stupid 500hp's arnt going to make that much of a difference, AC is king? well sure isnt proving it in my world.<P>Another big issue for me is Travel, I posted about this in the mage forum.. Why for the love of Zek can we not get a bind stone, Lore, No Drop stone that lets us bind at the Door to a  Dungeon?<BR>Its bad enough I get killed by green's before getting them half way down in health.. but when It takes me 40 minutes to run from one side of kunark to the other just to recover a body I usually quit playing after that. Most of the time Ill let my body sit and go do something else just because I dont feel like running all the way to get there.  Also make Gate sticks.. I know you can do it.. its what Apprentice Guides get right off the bat.. well make em in the game.. Make em mage summable, Lore - No Rent. Boy I could see mages making some good money off this and Warriors finally not having to find a wizard to translocate him.<P>My last and most important issue to me right now is our epic quest..  Im almost 52.. Soon I wont be able to take down a couple dragons for my scales.. and most of the time there is 10 other warriors all wantign the same thing.. dragons on a week spawn.. I seem to ding once every two weeks.. well hmm so far since I am not in an Ubber guild, and I dont have 40 friends to take a long I cant finish my epic.

</FONT><HR>Suggestion: New skill, gained anywhere from later 40's to mid 50's that functions as a supplimentary taunt.  Even if its exactly the same as taunt, as long as its not on the same refresh, (aka, both depress when you click either), but ideally, a stronger taunt with a longer refresh in addition to normal taunt.<P>Example of fight with new skill would be:<BR>Taunt<BR>Taunt<BR>Taunt<BR>Taunt<BR>New Skill Used Here<BR>Taunt<BR>Taunt<BR>Taunt<BR>Taunt<BR>New Skill Used Here.<BR>etc.<P>Also, preferably, it would not function in the same way as taunt, in that it simply pushes you to the highest name on the aggro list + 1 damage or whatnot.  But instead, + X amount of imaginary damage to the monster.  <P>I believe this would solve several complaints in one action, namely, the lack of skills from in the 35+ area, and the lack of taunt at higher levels.<P>Thank you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Several points:<P>1) Set kick/taunt/bash keys so that they auto recycle like the melee attack key.  Theres no real game play justifcation for forcing us to repeatedly pound these keys through every fight.  Plus by clicking 2x a player could still use bash/taunt/kick when they want to carry out any stragetic type moves.(Ie bash/stun to try to interrupt a caster mob)<P>2) A meaningful penalty is needed for large races in terms of game play.  My suggestion is to give the large races(Troll/Ogre/Barb) a to hit or damage taken penalty.  Thus the large race would be 25% more likely to be hit by a mob, or take 25% more damage etc etc.  To hit penalty makes sense as its more likely that a large creature will be hit than a smaller one.  As it stand now the large races are far superior due to str, hp and regen in the case of trolls.  A to hit penalty would balance the class out amongst the races, which is woefully needed in my opinion.  Plus, from a game play stand point it makes sense that a larger character would be easier to hit.<P>3) Don't balance us via avaliable item drops, ie we're balanced because we can use the best possible armor etc etc.  As an asside, what possed your item design team to put wisdom/int on high end haste items?  Its just an excuse on many servers to exclude no hybrids from getting items like the Cloak of Piety - maybe consider multiple variations of haste items useable be specific classes?<P>4) Taunt and crit/cripple hit lose their value to tanks as we level up.  Meaning that at 20 these skills are very useful and make a meaningful diffrence to a warrior.  At 60 taunt has very little effect and crit/cripple is nothing more than eye candy.  At the very least we need a better taunt to fufill our role in a group without the use of a high end haste itme and low delay one hand weapon in our primary hand.<P>5) 2 hand weapons simply don't stack up to dual wield in terms of damage and taunt value.  It would be nice if 2 hand weapon dmage came close to dual wield so a warrior could use his 2 hander and not catch grief from the gorup about npot dealin enough damage.  So some kind of meaningful improvement is needed to bring the 2 hander damage input a little closer to that of dual wield.  Perhaps increase the str damage modifer for 2 handers?  Maybe raise the low end cap on the damage these weapons do?<P>6) Disciplines should be on seperate recycle counters.  I have no problem with not be able to use to disicplines at the same time.  But why should using one discipline preclude the use of all others until thre recycle time expires?  This would make us a little more versitile.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alan,<P>I got the impression that you were in somewhat of a hurry (and frazzled by re-re-re-reposting  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">) when you made your reply. I do have to ask that you not make that your final word on what you're submitting. You didn't mention a number of points that have been raised by a lot of people, which leaves us somewhat in the dark in terms of understanding what you're getting out of the discussion.<P>Also, as a side note, I understand that warriors are the template by which other melee classes are based. The impression we're getting however, is that you would prefer to keep warriors entirely as they are while considering boosts to the other classes. <P>We don't have much in the way of fringe benefits; we have a straightforward job and we all generally enjoy that. Most of the intelligent requests here are centered on a desire to be the best at that straightforward job. Taunting, survivability in travel, equipment (more important to warriors than perhaps any other class because we rely so heavily on it) and how tough we are become the most important issues. Other points, such as racial diversity, the desire for something new lvl between 25 and 50 are requests that don't so much threaten balance, but rather simply stem from a desire to do a little more, press another button or two, even just make things a little more complex. <P>Warriors are a template class. A straightforward job with a complex tactical side. We're mostly happy...these are just a few things to allow us to do that job as we're supposed to do, and maybe some eye candy on the side to spice things up.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You know, if you had to pick one class defining trait of a warrior, it would be taunt. The main purpose we serve in a group is to be attacked, and survive it long enough for others to do their job.<P>From a balance perspective, taunt being broken above 50 makes perfect sense, as nearly all of the other classes have also found their class defining  traits useless at that point too.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> I suppose that giving us increased taunt capability would have a huge impact on balance... if the monks, rogues and rangers could whack away indiscriminantly all day, and the wizards chain nuke with no aggro, then the game would be a lot less challenging.<P>The main question is really, is it acceptable and desireable for warriors to narrow their weapon selection (which is probably the largest in the game) to a select few in order to accomplish what their skills do not. If so then nothing needs to be done, if not then you need to make a wider array of weapons viable for holding taunt - either by introducing skills or re-tuning how taunt and the hate lists work. It would also be a welcome change if you can find a way to make taunt strategies more varied in the process.<P>To see what I mean, conduct a survey of how many 50+ warriors use a two handed weapon as their primary configuration. Ask the ones that got their epic if they have ever found a tactical situation where it is better as a two handed weapon. I can't believe it was Verant's intent to keep two handed weapons almost completely unused by warriors. Although not as significant, the ability to equip a shield is largely useless to a warrior after they get dual wield, yet there are many shields they could wear that couldn't possibly be obtained before that level. <P>Warriors have the widest array of armor and weapon selection and the highest skill caps in nearly every melee skill. No complaints there, this is our compensation for not getting spells or any real solo capability. We have the best balance of HP, AC and damage output of any class in the game, as well as the one of the greatest reliances on other classes (I think rogues would come ahead of us). I don't see any reason to mess with that balance overall.<P>Just asking for a little more variety, and a wider range of weapons to covet.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>List of what I think warriors need in order of most to least:<P>1. Epic weapon - Hardest melee epic to get by far. No middle of the road. Make the mobs drop the items 100% of the time and remove the PoA item(reason why I say remove the PoA item, is it takes 12hrs a day 3 days in a row to get there to get the wingblade. Not everyone has that luxury of doing it on a weekend or even weekday.)<P>Add 15 ac to each 1h slashing epic (blade of tactis/strategy), and 40ac to the 2h version Jagged blade of war (Tanking is what we do best, the epic is pathetic compared to other melee's epics, this will balance it nicely)<P>2.  Cobalt armor needs to drop more often.  There are generally more warriors then rogues or monks or ranger or etc. and therefore cobalt should drop more (I would say mainly the bracers and helms)<P>3.  HPs - I would like to see more hps (not drastically more) per level as a warrior. increase it by 2-3 per level or something small?<P>HPs is okay really but I would like to see stamina actually mean more hps then what it does (which should not outbalance anyone as it will effect everyone with stamina).  A 50 point increase in stamina should mean 400more hps or so yet it only means 200 at max. Check the stats you will see what I mean =)<P>Again most notable change would be the Epic item as everything else is pretty decent for warriors.<P><BR>Thanks again,<BR>Moofrog</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alan,<P>In your response you didn't mention two hot topics at all. Please say something.<P>(1) Warriors need a travel escape mechanism.  We are unbalanced in travel safety, because warriors are the class most likely to die traveling naked, and must travel naked from the bind point.  Perhaps enhanced hand-to-hand skill, or a sprint discipline would solve this.<P>(2) Warriors are expected to be the primary tank, yet achieving enough armor to be this is impossible for anyone who cannot commit a field of 30 players for 35 or so trips.  That's for the lesser indicolite.  Committing enough time to get REAL armor like cobalt isn't even possible for most of us. Velious helped, but have you looked at the rate of corroded plate drops and PoG armor lately?  One plate piece in three eight hour days is what my groups have seen.  Something needs to be done.  Increase the drop rates. Give warriors 2 AC per level.  Give us a 100 plat charged item that adds 100 to our AC for two minutes.  Heck, there's lots of solutions.<P>The  comment about the 'base' class speaks loudly.  Well equipped warriors serve as the 'base', but 95% of us aren't well equipped. We are poorly equipped, because we cannot produce income on our own, have to use what gear we find, hav eto fund our clerics, and have to share few drops with the many people who choose the class.<P>I believe the Verant view of warriors as being too powerful is skewed by certain warriors who have the best in gear, the most talented guilds, and limitless time to invest.  Well equipped warriors are immensely powerful.  In fact, the ordinarily equipped warrior is totally replacable as a tank by equal level monk or paladin. <P>If the only way warriors are to compete is to be  gear, then make that gear available. I mean available on a simple 'there is enough in the world so if 100 warriors per server go out to get thier armor today they could conceivably be complete in a year' kind of available. It's not that way today. <P>I'm not saying that everyone should get uber gear. I AM saying that it is wrong to treat every warrior like they have uber gear, because they don't.  The rank-and-file of us over 50 have half indicolite, cobalt gloves, and a skull shaped barbute to go with our mismatched other pieces.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Thank you for revisiting this thread. I do have a redirect for you though.<P><BR>**On Hit Points**<BR>Absor said-<BR>“I'm reading things like more hit points… no.”<P>Frankly I’m a little surprised that you categorically deny the option. Are you saying that the warriors natural HP won’t be touched or HP in general? <P>In the past EQ has been very liberal with it’s distribution of items with the life blood of casters MANA. How then, is the request for more HP in the item sense is not an option in your mind? Furthermore since warriors are the tanking class, what is it about a possible warrior only item that would add to a mature warriors HP significantly? I think that if you look at the ratio of mana to hp items you will find a vast disparity. That in mind it would follow that warriors would take issue with this as HP is the only pool of resources to work from. <P>Please clarify this statement and elaborate your vision of how Hit Points enhancements are a throwaway suggestion.<P>**On Spells Available To The Warrior Class**<P>Absor said-<BR>“…possibility that we will see something that needs to be nerfed. For example, I really don't like the idea that warriors have so many spells available to them through items, especially things like invisibility.”<P>I take offence to this statement as it reeks of ignorance of class balance to the core. Not to criticize your opinion but perhaps there are a few factors that should be brought to your attention about the warrior class. <P>In a general sense please be aware that the effects that you deem nerf worthy are by and large found in the casters arsenal below the level of 15. That being said I feel very strongly that our “effects” are any kind of threat to blanace or the need for support classes.<P>You specifically targeted a utility spell as a crusade item for a potential nerf so by doing so let us look at what this dose to us as warriors. Utility spells are those that help every player in there day to day lives but are not in any way assigned to any one class.<P>Examples include<BR>Invisibility<BR>Levitation<BR>Enduring Breath<P>Consider that these types of spells exist either as a potion or an item that is ALL/ALL so by targeting the warrior class you are effectively stating you wish to EXCLUDE us from what every other class is entitled to. It’s not a mater of weather or not we should be capable of doing it, it is a matter of convenience. Why you seek to make it inconveniencing for the sake of a perceived balance issue is beyond me.<P>Since you targeted invisible let’s explore that one option and see what observations can be made from a warrior perspective.<P>First off, warriors are the only class without and means of stealth operation or instant retreat. We are the ONLY class. Monks Feign, Rogues hide, bards play a song, rangers camouflage, casters gate. Perhaps you didn’t understand that bit of warrior trivia? Invis avalible on 2 ultra difficult spawns is hardly the threat you make it out to be. But while we are on that subject lets explore the variation.<P>To have invisable as part of the warrior arsinal we have to kill one of 2 mobs.<P>Venril Sather, a 1 week spawn, with a exreamly rare chance of a warrior drop. I would venture a guess that warrior cobolt legs have a world entry rate of 1 set every 1 ½ months.<P>Overking in Chardok, a position that takes 3 groups minimum to get to and a rare drop to boot. Add to that the fact that this option is inferior to cobolt and PoG drops.<P>Both options push any warrior to the edge of his/her ability to even be considered for a chance to MAYBE random on an item. An item that takes time to cast and is easily interrupted in a combat situation.<P>Compare to the SK version of invis item “Circlet of  Shadows” which is instant cast and can be obtained by a solo SK at the upper 40’s.<P>Has there been an outcry of SK ruining the balance of the invisibility barrier? I think this grail of yours is unfounded and slightly offensive to a warrior who would like nothing more than to be on per with every other class as far as utility.<P>**On Disciplines**<BR>You state that the description of the Aggressive /dis is in error over the documentation that is commonly available. Would you care to tell the warrior community what this discipline actually is as we only have the official description as a source of reference. In addition, perhaps all disciplines should be re-worded to give a more accurate description as to their function.<P>For your records please note the “official” description of Aggressive:<BR>AGGRESSIVE (Level 60):<BR>The warrior will do more damage with every blow landed, but will also take more damage as well. This discipline lasts for 3 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 27 minutes. <P>“More damage with every blow” implies an incremental increase but in practice and by your admission this is not the case. Please provide an accurate description so that we may know exactly where to place this discipline on your priority list.<P>Again, thank you for your attention in the class.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Taunting: It's mostly in the equipment the warrior has.  If he is one of the few warriors that has the incredibly hard to get uber weapons for his level, he will taunt fairly well.  The vast majority of other warriors will be stuck not being able to taunt effectively.<BR>The other part of taunting is what your group does.  A group that does not manage their aggro well will not allow the warrior to taunt mobs off of them.  The big problem I have with this is that the warrior generally gets blamed for it when someone dies, because the warrior cannot prove that other player members weren't doing their part.  Other classes do not rely as heavily on other classes for the successful completion of their class function, or if they do, it's relatively easy to prove that someone screwed up, ie. 'I saw you attacking the mob I was trying to mez.'<P>Equipment: Equipment is more necessary for a warrior than any other class, even though their equipment costs more pp or drops less frequently than other classes items.  Paradoxically, warriors are the least well-suited class for the generation of money or camping of items.  Spells, on the other hand, are insanely cheap, and can never be lost either.<P>Weapon skills: Aren't warriors supposed to be the 'masters of unarmed combat, in all it's forms,' as the FAQ states?  Can you honestly say this is now the case, Absor?<P>You compared your AD&D fighter to the warrior class in EverQuest, which is a joke.  The fighters in AD&D are much stronger, and the casters in AD&D much more limited than their counterparts in EverQuest.  A high-level AD&D fighter would still be tough with a rusty sword and regular chain-mail, and wouldn't have so much of their worth invested in their equipment.  Powerful items were a reward, but not the key to survival. The casters in AD&D were all about strategy, not brute force damage.  You managed the few spells you could cast each day carefully, hoped you chose the right ones to memorize, and then even if you picked right, you probably ran out of good spells long before the adventure was over.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, first off I'd like to say my main is a monk.<P>I see a lot of warrior requests for damage up to near monk level and requests for more AC and HP.  So I'm thinking...OMG...my high lvl monk has much less HP and a bit less AC than a high lvl war and with him using dragon eye swords, lams, jade mace, etc...with his skillz near 250...he's doing almost as much damage as me.  So if a war gets more dmg, AC, and hp...my monk would be obsolete.<P>However, I agree with these requests.  Warriors, being tanks, should have A LOT more AC and HP than my monk.  I would not mind if they could take more hits...just make sure they have the ability to get the mobs attention to put all that AC and HP to good use.  Warrior dmg looks fine to me at the endgame.  As for clicky effects, warriors getting them is fine...I don't think they overballance them and makes the class a little more interesting to play.  I'd be happy if wars got more hp and ac and dmg power to be a great tank, just make sure my monk has some awesome role to get into groups as well.  <P>Plz, before Kunark Monks rocked, but as the less balanced classes turned into gods with RoK (Wars and Rogues) the monk lost quite a lot (lost offense advantage, lost defense advantage, lost important role in groups).  Plz, now that you are looking into improving monks, make sure wars aren't crapped all over else you'll have the same situation later where the weaker classes are improved in abundance while the war either stays the same or is nerfed.<P>Giving Wars more HP, AC, and offense is great...it goes towards what they're meant to do.  That would go great if you also make improvements to monk's evasive abilities, dmg dealing power, etc.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A note about armor spells:<P>I noticed that you disagreed with their very existance, and the one you targeted in particular was Invisibility.  I'm a lvl 59 Warrior, and I'm well familiar with both the items that can hide a warrior from view.  At one time, I was the owner of one of only two Incarnadine BPs on my server.  I think there may be as many as 5 now.  This BP allows a Warrior or SK to cast Gather Shadows, a self only invis spell from the necro line.  I used this bp until I was lucky enough to win Cobalt Greaves from a guild raid on VS.  Cobalt Greaves cast Invisibilty on a warrior or a party member.  I'm in one of the top 3 guilds on my server and I still own the only pair of cobalt greaves in my guild.  Server wide, I think there may be less than a dozen of these floating around.<P>My point is this:  Of all the armor spells warriors have on class armor, Invisibility is the ONLY one I would miss if you zapped them all.  I just don't use the others, they're not worth clicking on.  But Invisibility is.  You think that's unbalancing, and if the items that cast Invis were common I would agree.  But the rarity of these two items is also the very reason they should keep their spell effects.  It takes a LOT of work, a strong guild, and amazing luck to be the wearer of these items.  I think that's a good example of risk vs reward working as intended.<P>I've replaced all my cobalt with PoG armor.  Except the legs.  The spell effects on the old cobalt did not even weigh in my decisions to replace them.<P>Armor spells are really not an issue.  They're parlor tricks, and don't affect the outcome of any combat situation.  The only ones with any practical use are Invisibility and Invigorate (I only use it to top of my hps to save a cleric's mana, if we have downtime, or to very slowly self heal after a rez).<P>So scrap all the spells but Invisibility, I won't shed a tear.  But I don't see the need to nerf only one I really care about.  It's rare, and it's a reward for a hard fight.  It's in no way farmable, either.<P>Oh, I forgot to mention - I have found Reckelss Strength to be of use.  When transporting ore for smithing, and you're encumbered 525 stones over 200, you can use jboots and cobalt gauntlets to walk, slow, for a few seconds.  Recast, rinse and repeat and you can make it to the forge.  By Sunday.<P>Coffinn Unforgiven<BR>lvl 59 Dark Elf Warrior<BR>Sol Invictus<BR>Tribunal<P>Bombastic P.

</FONT><HR>I'm a level 60 halfing warrior, here's my contribution.<P>Some of these requests here are really silly, our class is already EXTREMLY powerful, on the verge of being overpowered. We do NOT need more HP or AC. Buffed on guild raids I break 1300 AC with full beserker and other AC gear while maintaining 5300 hit points. How can you say we need this upgraded? Note.. I AM A HALFING, a ogre or troll can easily have 5800 HP in HP gear. Honestly we do not need more HP/AC.<P>As for our uber, the weapon is EASY to get if you have guild support. These weapons are not intended to be easy to get, you have to have the strong support of friends and a guild. None of the mobs are extremly hard to kill, and the drops are pretty common to not too rare.<P>Beserker frenzy on a timer? Would this co-exist with how it currently is? Beserker frenzy is good as is because anytime we get low health, we go in to it. As a warrior I would NOT want to give that up for a timer reset beserker frenzy. Now if we could have an IMPROVED one on a timer, that'd be great.<P>Disciplines... Alan what ever you do, don't touch Defensive. Velious mobs are designed around this discipline and having warriors who are capable of using it. This is our class defining ability at the moment.<P>Aggresive needs to be checked at level 60, it seems like a waste of a discipline too me. I've tested it a few times to figure out what it's use is, and will never use this on a raid or in a duel. You get hit HARD and you don't notice any difference in the increase of your hits.<P>Resistant? +10 to each resists? This needs to be increased as well. +20 to +30 resist depending on level would be more fiting. +10 resist doesn't mean much in VP.<P>Disarm needs an improvement. Perhaps add a SMALL change to stun when disarming. This will add to it's effectivness.<P>Our growth plane armor drops WAY too much, I got a full set in three days. But this isn't what you're really looking for.<P>It'd be nice to see an increase in the use of taunt as well past 55.<P>Honestly I believe the warrior class as it stands is FINE and BALANCED. Nothing needs to be touched, the only real suggestion I can give you is include a small stun when disarming to increase our usage of it.<P>Piercing to 255 would be good too, but honestly it's not needed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One more thing Alan, this is the ULTIMATE thing that ALL warriors with their ubers want. Increase the taunt value on the PROCS or decrease the delay by 1 or 2 points. This will make all warriors with ubers happy and we would ask for NOTHING else ever again :P</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Firstly, I don't play a Warrior.  I play a Cleric, but my primary hunting partner plays a warrior.  I hear and see many of the complaints she has about her class while we hunt.  Basically, she's upset that she has nothing to look forward to for the 15 level gap of 35-50, while Casters and Hybrids get spells throughout their lives.<P>Idea for a new skill between 25 and 50:<BR>Absor mentioned the possibility of adding a wide-swing sort of attack to hit multiple enemies.  IMO, this skill should do about as much damage as Bash/Slam (not as much as Kick, and without the possibility of stun/interrupt), and hit everyone around (or at least in front of) the warrior.  Skill should be linked to Bash/Slam and Kick such that it's an alternative skill and not too unbalancing.  Suggested level is 40, since disarm is achieved at 35.<P>And for those of you who say Disarm is useless, yes it's not the most useful ability, but as a Cleric watching the mana bar, disarm is a noticible help on the mana when a mob attacks with the weapon, when it works.<P>Corinus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok Absor you dont want to talk about specific equipment isues unless they are broken well 2H usage is indeed broken in relationship to taunt.  Please consider some way to increase the taunt factor of these weapons/lower the parry/riposte/dodge rates of mobs when we use them.  Currently only a soloing warrior outside of a group/in a group without a cleric ever considers pullin out their two handers, that is if they actually continue to carry one around with them.  I outlined some ideas in an earlier post, and do nt want to rehash it here until I saw your encapsulated list.
