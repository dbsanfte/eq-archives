</FONT><HR>As I have so many high level characters in the game I have spent much of my last week or so reading those threads.  They seem endless.<P>I join this thread as a result of myself having a 56 necro.  I have 4 other level 50+ characters so I have a good idea of how the game is played and what most of the intracacies are with it.<P>I will not participate much in this thread except to say that Absor has absolutely NOT pointed to the main problems associated with the balance of the necro class, from what I read of his initial post.<P>I am, in fact, a bit dismayed that he would even consider to try to post the information he has.  I also find it very difficult to understand how he feels he can, as an middle made cut so much out of what we say when we are really not communicating with him.  We are not communicating with Absor people.  We are communicating with the development/tuning team.<P>This is a big issue for me.  To have a relative newbie to the game (yes, I consider his level of play and time in game as making him a newbie).<P>Of all the things I read what gets to me worse then anything else is that he thinks that the necro is a mana transfer pc for epics.  This is not true.  It is not what every necro should be fighting to get to level 60 for.  This is utter nonsense and pure bull**** to tell me that I have to get to level 60 only to participate in these encounters as a mana transfer.<P>If you read what he wrote, he was attempting to manipulate the direction of this series of necro threads to be turned in that direction.  I've read most of the necro threads over the past year and I can tell you that no necro that I know wants to play their game to the highest level so they can sit down and feed their mana to the cleric or other healer.  That is totally useless and belittling role and I resent the manipulation that I see in what Absor wrote.<P>This is what I mean by Absor is not the person we should be addressing our comments to.  Our comments should be competely outside of the scope of what Absor sets and directed at the development and tuning teams.<P>I'm sorry, but I'm a bit upset here.  When I read what he wrote I about choked up my soda.  I was shocked he would even postulate this as the end-game of the necromancer.<P>As a necromancer, certainly, mana transfer is an ability, but that ONE spell should not and IS NOT the end game of the necro.  The necro is asking for more then just being able to transfer mana to the healer classes.<P>It is an embarrassment to me to even read half of what I've read from the initial post.  Something needs to be done and I hope every necro participating in these threads lets Absor and Verant know that this is not, absolutely is NOT the focus of why I spent more then a hundred days making my necro level 56.  It is utterly rediculous to even consider that the necro's job in epic encounters should be to transfer mana.  The necro has far more abilities then transferring mana and the end game should never come down to that one thing.<P>Bull****.  That's the last of what I have to say about this.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You guys still dont get it.<P>Did that football player run all the way down the field against 11 other players all alone?...or did he have 10 other people helping him?<P>It really boils down to the fact that necros want to land the killing blow and do more damage than anyone else.  In my example above I show how necros were vital to success.  The warriors did NOTHING...ABSOLUTELY NOTHING...<P>If they had, we would have all died.  The final mob is fine to kill, but getting to him and helping the raid be successful is also very fun...  <P>So you dont get to blast him for 20,000 points...I dont mind.  I helped get us there. I am in on the kill.  Out of a raid of 30 people how many actually 'kill' the mob?  Answer: 1<P>One person kills the mob.  So why not do what is necessary to kill the mob?<P>You say...well instead of a necromancer just bring another cleric...<P>Wrong... a group full of clerics will never get you to that mob.  You need classes who can get you to the final fight and a necromancer is one of the best.  <P>So, then what better than have a class that can fight its way to the final mob and then assist the clerics and tanks in killing that mob.<P>Do you get anymore glory for making the final blow or doing the most damage? (please dont say exp here..no single mob gives enough exp to make a difference)<P>No, your raid group or guild is all happy...you get the great loot and you had fun doing it.<P>One mob will never ruin a great raid for me..sorry,I just don't feel your pain</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Let me sum up my feelings on alot of our spells.<P>1. Leave the Lich line alone. This affects so many areas of our class it would be very harmful to correct this now. If nothing else leave the necro alone if our only compensation is being able to tap dragons.<P>2. Make taps landable on Uber mobs AFTER debuffed.<BR>Why is it that I can tap all the SoV Dragons I've come across once debuffed but not the Old World and Kurnak ones using the same debuffs?<BR>Theres something wrong here that needs looked at. Taps are mana inefficent this is made up for by using lich to turn hitpoints into mana so the healing part can figure into it. Making lich burn more hitpoints while having taps return the same throws things off.<P>3. Most people dont' realize you use Demi Lich for the mana and Arch Lich for the faction adjustments the Illusion gives you. Arch lich is a toy.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> So they are fine imo. If you want to tinker with it leave Demi Lich Alone and change Arch lich to just the illusion but add some more benifits to it such as Infravision, higher resistance to poison and fear spells. Lower hitpoint regen but not a negative affect. Make undead like us in this form. By the time we can scribe this near all undead are green to us anyway.<P>4. Dots, Great for soloing but take to long in a group setting so limits our damage dealing abilities in groups. Possible fix, make a fast acting INDOOR only dot. Also look into the aggro dots have. Why can someone nuke for 1k+ damage and I dot something that does 110 to start and get beat on immediately.<P>5. Pets, they have no resistance, very little ac, atk and hitpoints for the mobs we fight now. The only way a necro has to use his pet is fear kite in a solo situation. On Uber raids they die to the first couple rounds of AoE or are feared away due to no resistances. They are such low a level anyway they do very little damage. Necro pets need an upgrade in the attack department to compensate for the low hitpoints. And we need the fearless spell and jboot speed spells for the pets. Why? We are the 2nd best pet class but we seem to be treated as the worst pet class when it comes to abilities for the pets. Something Verant has failed to realise is you gave necro pets a tap process to help compensate for the dagger delay you removed from us. This wasn't a bug. It was stated manytimes as an advantage necro's had over mages. Well the recent process change has in effect negated this tiny upgrade for the delay nerf since my pet went from processing 10 or so times a fight to 2 if its lucky. Necro pets used to hit FAST and for consistant damage. They had the regen to make up for the lack of hitpoints but all this seems to have been taken away. As a mage friend of mine said, "Necro pets need alot of work."<P>6. Screaming Terror, Some would like an upgrade to this but I'm fine with this spell. As it stands I can use it in a pinch to help out on a bad pull as long as there isn't more than a couple adds, and it can be used to interrupt some mobs casting. Leave crowd control to bards and enchanters. Only thing I could see to improve this is to drop the cast time and recast time some.<P>7. Ignite/Chill bones. Just remove the illusion. Its the only usefull nuke we have and we dont' care if it looks pretty at 44 its not used therefor useless to us later on. We also don't care if its just another DD spell. The recycle time alone prevents me from casting it at the very most 2 times during an average group fight. <P>8. Mana transfers, leave the ratio alone. These are just fine as they are but if you "fix" lich it will lower this ability immensely as we will have to use someone elses mana to heal us and take lich off to make up for the lost hitpoints. This all would result in more med time for necro's. The main use of these is to reduce downtime during buffing or help out in a tight spot if no med time is in sight.<P>9. Night time only spells, I'd love Levant to be usealbe anytime. Its a one way inter zone transport that takes alot of mana. Usually 4-5 cast of this and I'm oom so moving this to anytime wouldn't make a huge impact on us just more of a conveince factor. Now Quivering Veil of Xarn should be useable anytime of the day. A Invulnrability spell thats limited to night time only is really silly no matter how you look at it.<P>10. Group DMF, I think everyone agrees that if we are gonna buff with this spell as one of our primary rolls on raids we should get a group buff. Make its duration shorter and mana cost more to compensate.<P>11. Corpse poofing. Till you 100% guarantee that its fixed and change your customer Service Rules on poofing mobs a necro will never be allowed to use dots on a raid. You can log so much now and check into transactions surely you can log Uber Mob encounters too.<P>12. Spell drops. 55+ spells are really rare. Too rare they should be more common. People shouldn't have empty spell books from Kurnak spells this long after Kurnak is out.<P>13 Darkness line. We 99.9% of the time use the 29 Dooming Darkness. Most Necro's use this for the snare effect not the damage. Our Darkness line has some nice damage too it but the 49 and 59 darkness just takes too long to cast to be useable. Fix them by making them cast fast. Then people will start using them more as they are really nice dots later on.<P>14. Essence gems. These are perfect for the Convergance spell, our 53 resurrection spell. They are used as they should be raid saving devices or incase of no cleric handy if your out exploring an unused zone. But the other spells that use this just simply will never be used. Even though now that the experience patch went in I see exp being cheaper and more people willing to waste an hour or so of exp to get 1000 plat. I would if I was broke.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>15. Our Plant line of DD, I'd rather see these removed and replaced with an upgrade to Shock of Poison at 52.<P>16. Trepidation. Our upgrade to Invoke fear. I used it when I first got it, noticed it did the same as Invoke fear and haven't used it since. <BR>This spell needs to have its cast time dropped, resistance lowered, and duration of the spell increased for double the mana it uses.<P>17. Thrall of Bones, (54 undead charm) limited use mainly due to our low charisma.<P>18. Our root line is kinda of screwy at 49 we get our best root but we get other root spells later on. Doesn't make sense.<P>19. Undead DD spells. Nice but very few undead to fight against.<P>20. Feign Death upgrade would be nice but nothing that we must have. Although a SK with VS legs(FD on them) and his 2 spells can out pull a monk.<P>21. Conjure/Summon corpse needs to be able to be used on people not in the zone. Its such a huge waste of time to have the tanks to run to Sebilis after a failed Trak raid. 75% of the Raid's time is taken in summoning bodies if it fails. I just dont' see a way to allow us to target everyons body. Maybe give us track bodies/udead hehe.<P>22. Scent line. This debuff line is entirely useless. Its resited far too much and if I have to debuff something with this to make a spell stick my spells will not land anyway. Change this into a pet buff line.<P>23. Summoning mobs, yeah even I can see a reason for this in outdoor zones but in a dungeon where your gonna be toe to toe with the mob why do they have to summon you?<P>24. Our Epic, other than the first one no one actively goes after this item. The stats are a bit less than others and the effect is no better than our 59 Darkness spell. I want quack about er talk about the look  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">. Due to the PoA drop being so rare very few will get this item either. I went to the PoA we cleared to 7th isle got a few mage crowns for their epics but the horse didn't drop the cape. Put the drop on any 4th island horse would up the drop rate considerably.<P>Thanks for your time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Powerbait, you are not seeing his point to bringing a cleric.   Granted that was just an example, but an example none the less.   It is far more efficient to bring another person of a desired caster class (thereby having that persons FULL mana) as opposed to bringing along a necro and only being able to utilize 1/3 of his mana.  That to me is poor resource management.  And somehow I do not feel I am alone in that</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I've had my Necro for about 3 weeks now... and its been a great experience. <P>But its not worth it.<P>If any of you have read the "History of Norrath" It says that mordor (or whatever his name was), this uber erudite necro, could port himself. I think that, if Verant is going to include something like this in the HISTORY of their game, they might as well add it to our list of spells. <P>And what is this with Pets going away when you zone or go LD? Im on an AOL connection *Shudder* and I've lost over 200pp worth of bone chips and weapons in the past 3 weeks. Pets going away when you camp... now thats ok... Im perfectly fine with that.<P>Mages get a DD spell at Level 1. And its actually USEFUL. I think i can speak for most necros when I say I'd rather be able to deal a fair amount of damage quickly than a lot of damage over time. Please Absor... We need some good DD spells.<P>Pet healing also needs to be upgraded. I can heal my pet for around 10-15 damage at level 13... Wo0T! I dont even care if I can heal PCs... But I do care if im soloing and my pet goes down. <P>If we're KoS EVERYWHERE (especially Dark Elf Necros....argh....I haven't been to North Freeport in about 3 months... Its been longer since i've been to gfay) I think that we should get some *useful* spells.. like a massive DD or an Unresistable Fear Area Affect spell.<P>Also.. if we're masters of the dead... why cant we rez? :) Just a thought<P><BR>Anyhow...

</FONT><HR>Ok, Its time to let someone understand.<P>Powerbait.  I am a 54 necro on Prexus.  I can sit at the entrance to Seb, HS, and Keal...anounce LFG...nothing.  All I see is need a chanter, cleric, monk, rouge.  We are very powerfull with DOTS, but how many mobs in the uber dungens will last 90 seconds?  If they do, then you will have your work cut out for you.  I dont mind a support role in these areas, but I feel that we have been cheated.  We can kill anything pre 50 with ease, then at post 50 we sit and wait.  How fun.<P>Now, the reagent for the spec pet to me is should be lowered somewhat.  But, please don't cry to me about symbol cost.  I have a 49 cleric so I do know something about it.  Try to remember that groups tend to give all the money and gems, but very rare ones, to the cleric for the cost of symbol.  If this is not how it happens with you, then you are being used.  It is the understood rule on my server and I have seen raids where I have recieved nothing, and the cleric is encumbered with money and gems.  I am not crying about it, but you are compensated.<P>Now, please stop critizing everyone and only give good ideas to help the class post 50.

</FONT><HR>If you must fix the lich series of spells(this would devestate the class, but if it must be fixed prior to us being made something other then mana bateries on large raids, then so be it), then perhaps adding a regen componant to the epic weapon that would offset the extra damage demi lich would do.  This would fix the problem and make our epic something people would actually want(no i dont have the epic, this would devastate me, but at least Id really want the epic now)<P>Enchanters should be able to overwrite screaming terror, this would go a LONG way to making us more group friendly, without doing anything to increase our power.<P>Multiple the duration of devourering darkness by 4, divide the damage per tick by 4.  Effect a longer lasting snare with decreased hate and same end point damage dealt.<P>Do the same for the Epic weapon right click effect(assuming the regen componant is out of the question)<P>Upgrade the 56 and 59 pets hitpoints and defensive skills.  Personally Id like to see the monk pet do alot of blocks and dodges like a monk would, and the 59 pet having alot more hitpoints.<P>Against the things the necro are fighting at these levels, the pets are just thin paper bags.  The defensive skills on these things are fine for fear kiting, as the pet rarely gets hit, but as soon as you try to bring the pet into a group...<P>You are considering giving mage pets immunity to fear, well, consider giving it to necro pets as well, same reason, and it would make alot more sense for necros to have pets immune to fear, they are necros.<P>Lifetaps, been mentioned countless times, and I will mention it again, the biggest problem with necros in epic encounters is that when you disable the lifetaps, you just disabled the necro.<BR>When a wizard can land a 2000 point nuke, where is the imbalance in letting a necro land a 720 lifetap at a far worse ratio(if its being used as a nuke, the necro isnt being healed by it, thus that componant is wasted)<P>Trepidation is a shorter duration invoke fear that costs twice as much with no noticable advantage in saves.<P>Btw, its insanely easy to repro a poofing corpse, just dot something and fd, when it dies, it will poof, what bearing this might have on  actual encounters I dont know, but the only time i saw a poofing corpse in an epic encounter was ragefire poofing when a link dead warrior got the final blow.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I love it..I seem to have gathered quite a following here.  Now, where should I start?<P>12pp for a pet is nothing...get over it...I have gone on hate raids with 3 other clerics and come out losing money...yes it was a guild raid and yes all money items were given to clerics and enchanters.  Tru..other times I make more than enough to cover Peridots for 2 or 3 raids...I deal with it...<P>As a necro I go kill Hgs for 30 minutes and get my money back up...pretty easy to do and since I solo them all money is mine..<P>I guess the reason I am just not too worried about the necro class is I have a great guild and very good friends who can always get something going with....My solution to grouping problems is to start my own group if friends or guildies are busy....This works for me.<P>I also dont mind playing support in big raids...my ego does not need to be padded with the killing blow or the most damage (I am not calling any names here.  I simply am not bothered by these facts. I enjoy being with a good group who knows what they are doing.)<P>I really do not feel your pain.  My life as a necro, cleric, and warrior is fun nonstop.  I love EQ and have a blast playing.<P>I simply do not feel that the necro class is shafted.  Sure we want better stuff..what class doesnt?...but I honestly dont feel we NEED most of what people are asking for<P>Sorry if I offended any of my faithful followers, I am just stating my opinion..<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Necros main stuff: Necros are the best soloers. The game is based around grouping.  So once you get level 60 you become bored fast if you got nothing to do because the necros lack of anything to do on raids.  And thats one of the main fun things to do at 60.  This is the main problem with the necro!!!  I have made a cleric because of this and got to 60 on him(yes my necro is also level 60).  Most people would agree that necros are one of the most useless classes for raids out there.<P>Epic: I think the main reason there isnt many epics around because the epic is pure lameness.  I could of got mine if it was worth getting but it isnt.  Maybe its because you need a part from inno and cazic but I dont think the air part is the main bottle neck besides that fact that not many guilds on my server go to air and I assume its like that on most servers.<P>Lifetaps:  I think making lifetaps unresistable for a little lich nerf would be a good idea.  I would be happy with this.  It would make me be able to do something on boss mobs thats worth the trouble.<P>Mana tranfers:  Lets be honnest here giving mana to other classes is totaly useless UNLESS you make it useful ratio.  Why use a necro on a raid when you can be the cleric/wizard.  This is why I mainly play a cleric now.<P>Pets:  Magi pets rock necro's pet world which I  can understand but what I dont understand is why we cant use the sacrifce gems for a super pet.  Give it some niffy features something like immune to magic or whatever.  Also I think the level 59 pet needs to be looked into.  I think it should be buffed a  LITTLE bit.<P>Ignite Bones/chill bones:  These spells are heavly resistant.  They are all or nothing with a pretty big aggro tied in with it.  Either do a major change to them or dont waste your time.<P>DoTs and corpse poofing: I have not seen any corpse poof in ages so I think this is fixed..<P>Arch lich/demi lich:  Someone asked why we got two and the main reason I can see is arch lich is better for soling and demi is better for grouping.  <P>thanks<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, ive been reading a lot of this and to be honest its making my head hurt. There is a LOT of stuff that is being repeated and the bottom line is that IMHO they wont really do much to satisfy our Necro Community.<P>Im not going to add to the masses of redundant ideas that people are sharing to try to balance our class because they have been stated in every way, shape, and form.<P>I am going to say something about the Epic Weapon though. In balancing classes the Epic MUST be looked at. This is an EPIC Weapon for each class. It is a defining look for that class (even though I would perfer not to be seen with ours) and gives them an ability that makes them more efficient as an individual. Please correct me if I am wrong in my assumption. <P>Now the effect on the Epic is a little undesirable because it is a line of spells we get and we even get better then what is on the weapon. I personally think the effect should be left on the weapon because it is an often used spell by the class but it should have something that makes it more desireable to use over our spell book version.<P>In closure, I think what should be changed to the effect on the Epic Weapon is the casting time, possibly move it down to say 4 seconds just like Dooming Darkness so that the effect is better taken and chosen over our spell book versions.<P>The Epics are done so players can have something new and fresh...Why penalize them for their time?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You said you had gotten no feedback on what to let defoliation (level 52) spell hit?<P>POG plants, all shrooms in Seb.<P>Also there is a bug with level 29 spell defoliate.  It was supposed to be added into the game when defoliation was (level 52 upgrade to it) back when Kunark spells went online.  It was never added to a vendor or put in the game.  I've checked with a GM and they forwarded it to some team within Verant, still not fixed.<P>Lifetaps/bond of death should be able to be landed on the uber monster encounters.  They shouldnt be unresistable, but maybe some set resist rate lower than wizard lures.  <P>The lich 'bug' you call it, isn't so much a bug as it is a feature that came about when the damage changes were made to PvP spells.  They're doing 1/3 less damage giving the same mana they always did.  It's a bit later to make such a huge sweeping change, but if making us actually be able to participate in raids and land our spells means fixing it, please do.<P>Easy fix.  Up the damage they do by 1/3, leave the mana return rates on them exactly the same.  Then you've put everything back to as it was pre-PvP spell changes.<P>Quivering Veil of Xarn.  night only?  Why?  We get harmshield an invulnerabilty spell at level 20, and at level 50+ get this upgrade to it.  Please make it usable at any time like harmshield, with a recast of 10mins.<P>Levant, night only????  Why?  True we're not wizards or druids.  But then again the spell working any time day or night isnt out of balance.  It has a huge mana cost and only teleports you within the zone to save travel time.  (often the destinations are dangerous anyways)<P>Group dead man floating.  Doesnt affect soloing ability, only helps us in groups.  Please add.<P>A level 50+ spell to make pets immune or resist npc fear more.  Everyone knows that player pets have crappy resists, lousy stats and so-so ac.  I was surprised to see you were entertaining the idea of giving fear immunity or increased resistance to it to magician pets and NOT necros.  Come on.  It fits theme wise 100% with necro.  So either give it to both if u feel that's necessary or give it to neither.<P>Please do something to make the 1200hp, level 59 lifetap that requires an essence emerald useful.  It and the infusion spell, in their current form are completely and utterly worthless.<P><BR>Thanks in advance,<P>Mindreaver *</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The aggro is huge, it is resisted often, and when it does stick, no one notices their spells getting resisted less or doing full damage more.<P>Perhaps make Scent of Terris unresistable?

</FONT><HR>I play as a lvl60 nec in Saryrn.<P>Ignite Bones: "If we canft size the skeleton, then we probably should remove it and find some other cool way to make sure that the spell 'sticks' to the target to prevent chain casting and to make it more than just another DD."<BR>Hello, I dont really understand why you have to "prevent chain casting", it already has 12SEC RECAST TIME how do YOU chain cast let me know. Anyways, it's hardly allowed to cast this spell in big raids due to it's notorious side effect as you clarified and I do wish it to be took away.<P>DoTs and corpse poofing: "Hopefully this is now much improved, but Ifm not taking it off the list until Ifm convinced it has been fixed."<BR>Necromancers are DoT casters till they hit 46 and start going to planes. They hardly ever do thereafter in raids because of this bug. It's not just "affect"ing but it's destroyed the class already. We can't start any balancing discussions without this bug completely fixed at the first position. I don't understand why you've been wasting time by like adding Subversion line of spells. Fix harming bugs first. Given this fixed we yet have many concerns about DoTs, like stacking, durations, etc., but you can't deal with them at a time can you, I'm quite skeptical after complaing for a year about poofing.<P>Mana transfer: "Again, if their eplacef against the boss mob is to transfer mana, then perhaps we should allow them to do it at a better rate."<BR>I agree with the necros who define themselves as an offensive caster class, not a supporting class. Hate to say I'm afraid there's no serious reason to invite a nec to a raid if you could find one after you LOST and started CR. Another wiz or a clr would be better if our 'position' was merely like that.<BR>But on the other hand it's indeed an interesting idea to build an intended 'mana healing' class! Give it mana-GH, mana-SH, mana-CH, mana-Remedy and so on. But that's not the way what the existing necros would like to take. Period. Make infusion targetable? LoL, VETO, NAY, STOP, EsE is too precious to waste in a way like that, it's made of people's TIME isn't it? Infusion (and Trucidation as well, of course) is currently useless not because it's self-only but it eats EsE.<BR>You can consider casting it tho in like dead-or-alive situations when 1000mana can actually save the raid, but I'm yet not sure if this has something to do with necros.<P>Making LT line irresitable is an interesting idea, but in general, the fact that those nasty mobs resist most spells is itself the problem. Basically not only nec but all caster classes save wiz are made useless against boss mobs. The reason why wiz holds is because it's a DD class and lure line spells are DD indeed. Nec is a DoT class so their DoTs, not LTs, should be usefull against bosses. LT line is cool but that's NOT the main point, because if only LT line be left, nec is merely a weak DD plus weak healing class. Better choose wiz or clr in that case too. Don't mislead the discussion.<P>Come on, I remember Brad or someone wrote "In a short battle wiz can churn out the highest dmg. But what about in a long one?" or something like that. Heh, I can answer who's the best in a long battle, waddaya think. Nec? NO WAY, ROGUE. Look at their HP, AC, and damage per minute! Doh. Now what's a nec intended to do in a raid? Err no, that's not what I want to know, let me ask, WHAT CAN WE DO TO TIE A WIZ? Or perhaps, considering the damage over TIME restriction, fine let's live with it. MAKE US THE BEST IN A LONG TIME BATTLE!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I heal someone but they lose SLN, NS, or PoG?<BR>Pact of shadow overwrites Shm bearform and some Enc buff that eludes me atm. <P>You gave us these spells to be more group friendly. Let me tell you the group isnt friendly after I have dispelled their buffs in an attempt to heal them heh. <P>Require an essence emerald in the inventory but not to be consumed for infusion and trudication. Perhaps then I will actually mem the spells once. <BR>Also the night only tag on the Quivering veil of xarn should be removed. I have to wait till lvl 58 for a harmshield upgrade that can only be cast at night? If I mem it, it takes 8 minutes to be castable I beleive. That means to have it usable for the night, I have to mem it during the day. I cast this spell once to see if it is really night only. I couldnt bring myself to beleive it until I tried it for myself. This spell is not being used in its current form. <P>On a side note, why not make night 8pm to 8am or something rather than 9pm to 5am. this seems very limiting to me.

</FONT><HR>Ok here it goes point by point.<P>Uber mobs : ok we can feed mana thats a given but we cant replenish our mana makeing abilities with any taps as you know.<P>Grouping in the highlevel game.<BR>I am probably one of the more versatile necros i know I can mes, feed mana, and deal damage all in the same group, I have played healer, tank, chanter and etc...<BR>But the necromancer has NO defineing grouping ability that isnt just a 60% weaker version then the class they are dealin with. Our damage spells are either huge agro on us, even timed correctly the amount of damage you can inflict and do inflict are totaly different to avoid agro and the eventual death or draining clerics mana.<P>I think Soloing is completely boreing and I dont do it anymore its as mind numbing as counting 1million dollar bills by hand. I like to group but have no real group benefit. Yes I can deal a huge amount of damage with my pet and my spells but what else can I do? My mes last 12 seconds and I cant maintian more then 3 mobs, maybe 4 or 5 with the right root/mes combo and that means with no resists.<P>Maybe an upgrade to some spell lines that werent touched past the mid 20's, Screaming terror 2 increase its duration by 12 more seconds its still a single target mes but will make us more versitile in our ability to crowd control when you cant find a chanter.<P>Maybe give us more "soft dots" like ignite blood and splurt wich donot agro mobs as bad as lets say Evenomed bolt, some sort of debuff thats better then our scent line, as is the scent lines make you autoagro most anything unless you hit it at below 50% wich is to late to be effective in any situation.<P>The essence emeralds cost vs their use is practicaly a joke. Most necros I know make twinks and sac them back down to 46 to keep them in gems, wich negates totaly what verant wanted (isnt that why you made level 60's un sacable  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> )<P>The only good use for these Emeralds are for reses, and I tell you what I am not likely to res anyone but me with them and most necros are the same. The cost is someone elses xp why use it and be stuck without a res later? <P>Our usefulness along with most casting classes have been cut onto nothing in the new SOV continent. Most groups in SOV MUST have 2 tanks and 1 cleric, and back up healer and support melee. No enchanters , necros, or mages are needed except for pet dmg because most of our spells dont hit except heat based ones hit once in a while but when your signature series like Darkness dont stick even on a level 30mob at level 55 its just plain bad apples.<P>While I see the purpose of the high resists, you are makeing some classes obsolete.<BR> I have a warrior who walks into any SOV are and is sent 12 /tells as soon as the LFG flag is put up. My necro/enchanter friends of the same level of my warrior usually spend 3 hours LFG before the go back to kunark where they are wanted.<P>I think maybe I rambling a bit on but I believe my points come accross.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;other issues not related&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>SPLIT the rahte 3200people prime on friday<P>Epic quest SEVERLY out of balance with thier uses/effects/drops/mobs required to kill.<P>THe only bank in all of norrath if you drop something the bankers "Eat" it needs to go (kunark bankers in the overthere VS outpost_)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Necro Spells that I think should be looked at - by circle...<P>Level 1<P>Sense the Dead - Take Necro pets off the list of things this spell points at so it can really be used as an undead monster seeking spell.<P>Level 12<P>Sight Graft - Many ways to make it useful<P>1. Allow the sight perspective change back and forth between yourself and pet when you change targets from yourself to pet and back again.<P>2. Allow this spell castable anywhere in the zone, so at least if you have to cancel it to get your own sight back, you could leave your pet at an area you are trying to watch, and cast the spell to check on the spot from time to time.<P>3. Take over the skeleton completely, being able to move, etc, like Eye of Zomm. Have sight graft break when PC is hit<P>Any of the above would make the spell at least useful.<P>Spook the Dead - Make undead fears more efficent in terms of duration-resistability-mana. In most cases as we gain these various undead fears, our regular fear is just as efficient, lasts just as long etc. This makes the undead fears not worth memorizing.<P>Wave of Enfeeblement - Making it targetable and function like most other area spells would be nice.<P>Level 20<P>Track Corpse - Having the direction your facing every tick is dangerous in many zones if your travelling a long way to a corpse. Making this spell similiar to ranger tracking i.e. "You sense the corpse to your left, right etc" would be prefered.<P>Word of Shadow - Usefullness ? If it was targetable area spell, yes. If its casting time was less, maybe. Otherwise only semi useful to collect bone chips or something like that if you have really really good concentration.<P>Level 24<P>Screaming Terror - Who knows on this one, last I check there is still a level cap on it? Is it still indoors only as well? Tried for several months to make this one useful. I appreciate trying to give us a memory wipe spell. But if your going to do it then just give us a weak enchanter one, don't try and be anymore creative, this poor spell has seen more changes than any spell in the game =D.<P>Level 29<P>Word of Spirit - See word of Shadow above<BR>Surge of Enfeeblement - See similiar spell above<P>Level 39<P>Wrod of Souls - I think u get this by now =D<P>Level 44 <P>Dead Man Floating - Wonderfull spell, probably my favorite. But in zones that don't allow levitate, is there anyway of just stripping the levitate component when zoning in or buffing with this in these zones? Most of the zones that won't allow the lev component it would still be extremely useful to have the underwawter breathing, and added poison resistance.<P>Level 55<P>Chill Bones - Changing a monster into a skeleton is one of the most entertaining effects we get. However, compensating for the fact that Ignite Bones is highly resistable 10 levels later seems a bit off. 500 DD is not useful at 55 regardless of the neat effect. Moving this one down to replace Ignite Bones would be a godo move, and replace this with something else.<P>Some Overall Stuff--<P>50 plus DOT's - I understand that you can only make dot so powerful before it become unbalancing.<BR>That said, I find it odd that the most efficient dot we get is our level 51 splurt. Some of the others we get post 50 have their place, but nothign touches Splurt for damage for the mana. I would think that we would get something else even more efficent than splurt sometime between 52 and 60, even if it didn't do much more damage.<P>-All 50+ spells that require essence emerald other than resurect...<P>Why ? I never see anyone casting any of these spells that require the essence emerald except for the res. First of all the component is absurd to get, which is understandable for the res, I can live with it. But, no one is going to use one of these components for a mega life tap or mega mana regen, or anything like that and take the chance that it might save someone, when they can use their component to res that person if they dont make it instead.<P>The only usefullness of these other essence emerald spells have is for ubber guilds with huge numbers of members where it is required of their guild people to sacrfice themselves every now and then to make these for their necros. <P>No one else will ever have enough of this component to ever use these spells, except for the res. Which means the average player has several 50 plus spells that he/she will never be able to cast. <P>I would reccomend taking all esscence emerald required spells out of the game except for the res and replace them with other spells, or change the component of the exisiting ones.<P>Other than all the things mentioned above, necros are doing just fine, and I am pleased with both their playability, usefullness in groups, and overall balance.<P>The only thing I can't comment on is raids on ubber monsters. I typically stay in smaller groups and don't participate in these kidns of events.<P>PoloMan<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056290-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056290.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056290-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056290-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056290-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056290&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056290&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
