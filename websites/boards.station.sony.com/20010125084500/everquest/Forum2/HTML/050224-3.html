</FONT><HR>Okay, if you actually get to this point, here is what I would like to see in summons.  Obviously you can't have Mages summoning staffs with 5 charges of Ice Comet or weapons that give permanent Haste.  But then again it is dissatisfying to be level 51 and be able to summon more of the same "stuff" you were summoning at level 8.  (Yes, food, water, bandages, and no weight bag could all be summoned at level 8).  So there must be a line drawn somewhere but it can't be too far back.  <P>Some Summons I personally would enjoy seeing (these ideas, most of them, are not my own, just interesting ideas I have seen).  <P>Summon Focus Stone - Summons a No Drop, Lore, Magic stone.  To use the stone, hold it in your cursor and click on any spell.  The Stone will be given 1 charge of that chosen spell.  Alot may say "It has little use if you can't give it to others."  and more will say "Way to overpowering" but I think that this is the true meaning of the Magician concept of being able to focus mana into objects.  Lets say you put the Spell Gate into the stone.  This would allow a quick, clickable way to get out of trouble.  Casting times are iffy.  The stones may be overpowered if they have no casting times.  If casting times were put on all spells within the stone, it would still be useful in those dire situations where you need just 1 more cast but don't quite have enough mana.  It would be even better to allow other classes to focus spells into the Mage Focus Stone, but that obviously would never happen, heh.<P>More Dispell Summoned type weapons.  Obviously weapons with Stun, Haste, Fire DDs, Cold DDs, Poison, Disease procs, DoTs (you get the point) would overpower a summoned Sword.  But I believe that the Dismiss Summoned on the Sword of Runes is very helpful against what Mages are supposed to be masters against, summoned stuff.  Higher level procs in higher level swords would be interesting and useful (sometimes).  <P>Summon GM - Very useful when you're on an island in OoT and get a tell from a GM you petitioned 2 hours ago. (just kidding of course).<P>Summoned ARMOR series - Any armor, stats don't even have to be incredibly nice (though hopefully better than patchwork).  Magic/Lore.  Particularly helpful when everyone in your Fear raiding party has lost their corpses.   You can suit up your tanks with weapons AND armor.  Could make Mages so much more useful on Raids, or at least CRs, heh.<P>Summon Mob - Summons a single random mob to your side from somewhere in the zone.  Would make Mages essential for groups.  Or even better, Summon Rare spawn, just stand where the rare spawn pops and cast, voila.  80% spell failure and you summon a Large Rat instead. (a joke)<P>Summon Mana Stone - "It's back?" No, of course not.  The mana stone would be similar to a focus stone, except Mages could "sap" their mana into the stone.  Might be an upgrade to the Mod Rod.  The mana would be stored in the stone, which could be given to anyone, and once it is activated the mana stored pours out in a 1 to 4 ratio or something.  <P>It would also be interested to see more Mage oriented dungeons.  The Hole was interesting, but the bad pathing made pets horrible and a Druid can do just as good damage against a summoned creature as a Mage.  Maybe quest spells, that yield special summoning spells.  Those spells would then be useful in conquering certain places in dungeons made to be conquered by a multiclassed group (or groups).  For example, a zone entirely under lava.  A quest mob in the zone (or a rare spawn) will drop a Spell: Summon Lavastone (somethin to that effect, could be a mob anywhere I suppose).  As a result, no group would have a chance of raiding the lava zone without a Magician.  There are very few if any zones out there that require the abilities of the Mage.  A Wizard could do a better job, and you don't have to worry about that pesky pet running into trouble. <P>Okay, well, there are more ideas for Mages, but alot of them don't deal with Summons.  I believe Mages do, however, need a huge revamp on their ability to summon stuff.  It is a class defining ability and it seems to fall short of any other class defining abilities (immensely).  The problem is that its hard to take a step forward with Mages summons without risk of overpowering.  But if we never take that risk, Mages situation will never improve to the norm.<P>-Esmos Darkmage<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1st of all, STOP giving our summons to other classes as right-clickable effects on armor!  Why would you not make items with a right-click effect of wolf form?  Because thats a druid/ranger specific spell that only they should get, well so are item summons.<P>I just had to toss in my ideas too, I'm not asking for everything here but a couple new fun spells or summons would really be nice.  Most of my ideas are for higher levels.  I've also gotten alot of ideas from reading this post and added in my own things.  Please remember that pet proccing was nerfed so they only proc 25% as often as they used too, any proccing weapons will not be that usefull.  All of my summon ideas are No-rent, if they are lore or nodrop I will mention that...<P>----Summon: Upgraded ring of levitate, 4 or 5 charges instead of 2 at higher level..<BR>----Summon: Upgraded mod rod, a better mana-to-hp ratio OR the same thing only not lore<BR>----Summon: Upgraded dimensional hole..  8 slots, instead of destroying items on linkdeath make it move them to other open spaces in the inventory.  If there isn't enough room the items that couldnt fit in your invent drop to the ground.<BR>----Summon: Upgraded waterstone, perhaps 2 or 3 charges instead of 1?  At kedge groups I have to supply 5 other people and they use waterstones up fast...<BR>----Summon: Gnoll hide lariat.  Basically a whip with the same stats, for higher levels... I've always wanted to summon whips for my pet  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>----Summon: Voice box..  1 or 2 charges of voice-graft for your pet only.  Pretty-please?<BR>----Summon: Large fireworks.  They do no damage and have several charges of a large pretty bolt-type partical effect.  So you could make summon a few and put on a lightshow for your friends  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>----Summon: Velium weapons..  Its a cheap proc but they make our ugly pets look a little better.  If we could make different weapons that looked like velium we would get to pick which ones to give the pet.  I always thought pets looked best with a velium mace and longsword  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>----Summon: Plate armor, with the AC of leather or cloth, no weight, wearable by anyone.  Good to scare your friends with.<BR>----Summon: GM.  Perfect for corpses under the world or bug-deaths.  If no GMs are online it will summon the highest-ranking guide to you instantly  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> (yes I'm joking)<BR>----Summon: Fire, Frost, Wind, Earth shard.  Range-slot equipable daggers giving fire, cold, magic, poi/dis resistances for raids.<BR>----Summon: Wand of swords. Level 53-55 LORE NODROP summon with 2 or 3 charges of shock of swords, make it costs a ton of mana to make and give it a 10 second casting time (Shock of swords has 6 sec casting).<BR>----Summon: Wand of bolts.  Same as wand of swords only with lava-bolt basically.  These would be for emergency save-your-arse nukes.<BR>----Summon: Sightstone, an upgraded coldstone, same thing with effect see invis while it is equipped.<BR>----Summon: Firestone, lore with 1 charge of our 49 damage sheild.  Make it cost alot of mana, we could give it to a tank in our group for emergencies.  This would probably be a 50-54th level spell.<BR>----Summon: Shadowstone: Effect invisibility while worn in ammo slot.  If we can't get improved invis like everyone else how about an summoned item we can give to people who can't cast invis themselves?<BR>----Summon: Deathstone.  Looks like a coldstone but casts a 10,000 point dot on the person using it once equipped.  We could give these to people we dislike... *evil grin*<BR>----Summon: Lockpicks (good idea Elvenking=)<BR>----Summon: Class items.  A bunch of items that are for each specific class only that fit in the ammo or maybe range slot.  The warrior item might have 6Ac and 6str, chanter one could have +50mana and +10cha, cleric could have +30mana +3wis...  These should cost alot of mana to make, we need something somebody might actually ask us to summon.  Now that our other summons are all effects on class armor we need something only we can cast. <BR>----Summon: Time-bomb.  I really like that idea  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> drop it and it goes BOOM 3-5 seconds later, only I think the damage should be resistable.. thats asking for abit much heheh.<BR>----Summon: Fountain.  (lore) Makes a tiny fountain you can stick in your backpack, with this you won't need to drink water.  Would be an upgrade to Everfount.<BR>----Summon: Food pouch.  (lore) Upgrade to Cornucopia.  Basically a pouch-looking item of infinite food you stick in your backpack that removes the need to eat all of your rations.<BR>----Summon: Boulder.  (lore, nonstackable) Summons a throwing boulder, just 1.  They are way too heavy for even an ogre warrior to carry around, but if I could make one for a tank in my group once in awhile...<BR>----Summon: 2 handed sword.  We can't make any 2HS weapons.. not even a cheap one.<BR>----Summon: 1 handed blunt.  2HB is awfull for any caster, we could use something to practice with at lower levels.<BR>----Summon: Shrinkstone.  Only usable on pet, shrinks it down really small.  Would mostly be for fun.<BR>----Summon: Female wood elf.  Can never get enough of these.<BR>----Summon: Pet.  No not a new pet, a high level CotH for your pet only.  So when Jabober goes and finds 10 friends off in Karnors if you have it memmed your group *might* live lol.<BR>----Summon: Misc weapon.  Picks any non-epic weapon model and summons a weapon that looks like it.  They all would have the same dmg/delay, just look different.<BR>----Summon: Blade of fire/ice.  Swords that proc about a 20dmg fire/cold AoE for a pet.  Would not be good if your grouped with a chanter or in dungeons, it would be usefull in the right situation.<P>Thats about all I can think of at the moment, if anything else pops into my head I might be back later on  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have seen many many ideas on things that the Mage class seems to be missing. I think we should be able to summon better weapons for pets. it would also be nice to summon 1Hnd blunt weapons and not 2 handers. I have no use for a 2 handers. the 2 areas where Mages are left out is the snare/root Ok Earthpet will root. but I don’t always want to make an earth pet also on a CR if I am out of regents I have no Protection to make my run with. It would be nice if I could summon a ring that has an effect of snare or root that might increase my chance of making it to safety. I wont go down the Mana regen that every other class has and mages are left out. Nope Just not gonna do it.  I do also like the idea of summoning a lost pet maybe make it cost a regent a second malchite it should clear pet agro like COTH does. just My thoughts. <P>Cravin Daklena lvl 54 Elementalst<BR>The RATHE<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Summon: Armor<BR>  This could be good.<BR>  Any way you can have the Armor appear in a bag on the cursor of the person you have targetted?<P>  Random DROPable ammo-slot buffs.  CR, FR, MR, etc items.  ammo-slot items that boost stats.  ammo-slot items that can do things the mage couldn't otherwise cast (like a very innefficnet heal (2 mana for 1 hp) which, if the mana cost was high enough, would be usable in big raids (the mage would have to spend alot of time before the raid).<P>  LORE NO RENT summoned items.  If the mage can only hold 1 of them, the stockpile problem isn't as bad.  NO DROP summoned items that show up on the cursor of the targetted player.  The LORE NO RENT NO DROP binding stone.<P>  Haste ammo-slot items.<P>  Summoned items used in tradeskills.  As ingredients.  Like, summoned phaontom silk.<P>  Robes.  For instance, 'Robe of Invisiblity' - whatever stats, _transparent_ texture on the robe (this might not be feasible due to technical restictions).  1 HB weapons.<P>  Summoned item with multiple charges of summon arror/bandage/shirken.<P>  Quests that give mages less-powerful versions of their uberquest item/variatons on same.  For instance, mage quest robes that are summoned.<P>  Summoned Tradeskill Containers (a summoned forge with 50.0 wt, DROPable).<P>  Summoned held & range slot items with nasty reagents (like gems).  Summoned items with a low-level DD and infinite charges, but won't work for low level characters.<P>  Dress clothes.  All/All weapons without the ability to attack (like the cerimonial wedding sword) that show up anyhow.<P>  I like the 'personal portable hidaway' - Root+Invis+InvisToUndead+LargeAC/ResistBuff.  Note that the entire effect pops (invis) once you are hit, so the AC/Resist will only help against the first attack.<P>  Brighter summoned lightsources.<P>  Hmm.

</FONT><HR>Hopefully Absor is still reading this thread.<P>The main problem with mages, They were a great idea that just ran out of steam.  It seems to me that there was a lot of ways they could have gone, but someone either stopped working on them, or the class was thrown in without being worked on much.  We are basically a 1/2 wizard with a pet.  Which is pretty powerful, I admit.  But it does show a lack of creativity sometimes.<P>I would have preferred magicians to have ALL summoning spells.  Instead of shock of blades at level 8, we should have Staff of blades.  A lore staff with 5-10 charges, perhaps growing in charges as we leveled.  The summon spell would be Massively mana expensive, and VERY long casting time, but, the staff's effect casting would be very quick.  Enabling the magician to Cast a lot of spells Very fast, but after the magician ran out of staves, there would be very little else they could do.<BR>+===================================================================================================+<BR>Unfortunately that is not how things went.  Now there are two problems with posting this thread.<P>Problem 1:  Verant has decided that summoned items cannot be more powerful than equipment that can be gained at a similar level.  This means that the items we can summon are only desired by a) Naked corpse runners, and b) People of much lower levels than us.<P>Problem 2: In suggesting new summons we are asked to try not to infringe on the abilities of other classes.  Unfortunately there is only so much the spell engine and game can accomplish.  Therefor, we have a VERY limited area in which to suggest new ideas.<P>Not too powerful + Can't use other classes abilities = No new ideas.<P>What magicians need, and what all classes would have, is something others will beg for.  Either spells castable on them, and combat abilities.  No point listing them here as everyone know what each class is good at.<P>I think what magicians need, in the way of summoned items, is more permanent effect items.  We have to wait until level 39 for levitate!  This ring should be permanent flight.  Our most requested item is permanent ultravision.<BR>Now since these items do give a perm-effect, the effect naturally has to be a bit smaller than what a casting class could just buff with.<BR>Also more of our summons need to go in the ammo slot.  This is the ONLY slot that isn't full o<BR>Also our summons NEED to be powerful enough that people will actually consider them!<P>Here are a couple ideas<BR>+===================================================================================================+<BR>Ring of Mist:  (Must be worn on finger) Between 34 - 49<BR>Summons a Lore ring that grants +1/+2 mana a tick.  Now this doesn't seem to be a lot to some, but it doesn't need to be renewed.  And it might seem excessive to some, but it does make a caster remove a ring with most probably int/wis or mana.<P>Earthen Torque: Neck slot      Around 34<BR>Summons a necklace that adds 10ac and +1/+2hp a tick.  Again there is a choice to be made, your current neck piece or a small regen necklace.<P>Banner of fire:  Ammo slot/Shoulder slot   Around 20<BR>Summons a fiery banner that fits in both slots.  +10 vs cold and +2/+5 Stamina a tick.  <BR>Good for fighter types that use 2h weapons and a nice resist piece also.<BR>+===================================================================================================+<BR>As for class balance.<BR>Magician pets should be quite a bit more effective than Necro pets.  After all Our pets are 3/4 of our power.  Necros have Many abilities aside from their pets, and magicians have 1, DD.  I in no way want Necros nerfed, I just feel that magicians give up SO much to get<BR>pets, that the pets should at least be substantially better than necros' pets.<P>Post 50 fire pets need to be looked at.  Maybe make them summonable when we already have a regular pet out, and make them a constant mana drain on us.  Once the mana is gone, *poof* goes the fire pet.<P>Work with the above idea.....  Magicians should really be able to have 2 pets out at the same time.  After all we are the masters of pet summoning.  Make a certain line of pets "secondary"<BR>they drain mana constantly and are situational.<P>Defiantly think Call  pet should go in<P>Summoning players from other zones should be a Level 60 spell.  Make is /cast 1 Playername  :    And either a /summonableon/off   function or pop up choice menu.<P>I defiantly think magicians should be able to use ANY item they summon.  Mostly as a fun factor.  Magicians running around with swords and spears would be cool!<P><BR>Thanks for taking the time to read this.<BR>Fizbon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alan,<P>Thank you for the opportunity to provide suggestions.  I have lots of ideas I would like to share.  I hope you make it this far down the list.  I apolgize on behalf of many mages at some of the waste of space some of these posters.  <P>First of all lets address some assumptions in the modern EQ game.<P>It may have been at one time or another that summoned weapons were way too powerfull for the intended level and thus to avoid power disparities by handing lowbies supremely powerfull summoned weapons were nerfed so as not to be unbalancing...<P>This is not the case now.  It is not uncommon to see first level warriors in full suits of crafted and yaks...<P>Summoned weapons will never take the place of good all around weapons..even for newbies.  I will never forget rushing out to get my first magic staff so that we could hit magic creatures and no one wanted it because they already had superior weapons.<P>Instead of having superpowerfull all purpose weapons, I think a mage is better served by having really good situational weapon summonings.<P>I do not know what the deal with 2hb staves are but they are not either prefered by any class nor are they used.  These need to go away.  When verant designed great items to hold in both hands it really has to be special to want to take those out of a casters hand for it to be even considered usefull.<P>Only folks that need a good 2hb weapon are lowbie casters and occasionaly a monk.<P>Given that what would be good?  Well the staff of tracing would be a good lvl 4 spell.  It should be a light source and also very light weight.<P>Any summoned item should be extrordianrly light compared to real ones.  This may make it more valuable and situational without overpowering it.<BR>I know monks and casters would really appreciate it.<P>While some casters do melee this goes away around 20-24.  So caster melee weapons after this point are largely pointless as a weapon.  Please keep this in mind.  <P>What is usefull and what is fun.  <P>Food and water is usefull.  Beer is fun.<BR>Bandages are usefull in the early game, they become worthless at the high end of the game.  Consider a high level bandage that doubles or triples hp given.<P>Ok lets get rid of most of the 2hb staves and replace them with 1hb, 1hs, and 1hp weapons.<P>At low levels small amts of mana and ac are very valuable.  I think small amounts of ac or mana on a summoned item would not be overbalancing.  Also all items should provide a light source.<P>Therefore I would suggest that in the levels of 8-16 appropriate weapons would be say:<P>Short Sword of Defense  4/29 AC +2 (Level 8 spell)<BR>Cudgel of Thought 4/29 AC 1 Mana +10 (Level 8)<P>Long Sword of Sheilding  6/29 AC +2 Str +1<BR>Dagger of the Mind  3/22 Int +1 Mana +20 <P>Get the idea?  I will leave it to you to figure out dmg ratios, and maybe a resistance like +1 or +2.<P>There should be weapons useable by a broad range of classes.<P>As weapons summonings go up they should provide more specialized abilities.  A mace that procs a low level mage damage spell is good or a uesefull ability like cancel magic (self only).  AoE spells are always frowned upon...don't ever give summoned weapons AoE procs please!<P>At high level summonings resistances become more important.  These can be balanced.<P>Sword of Water:  1hs 8/27 wt .1  +10 fire resist +15 Poision resist -10 disease -10 cold<P>The sword of runes is actualy a nice spell but the problem comes from at 29 when a mage gets the spell is friends have much better weapons and there is just not a lot of summoned creatures in the game to make the proc worthwhile.  Good proc but most folks fight summoned creatures in the 12-16 when they hunt lavastorm or at 45 when they go to hole...see the problem?<P>In Summary, summoned weapons should be very light, provide small benefits like ac, mana, in the early levels, mid levels add procs and some stat improvements like agi, dex, int and str.  At high levels weapons should be very specialized giving good resistance buffs and usefull abilities like cancel magic, gaze, see invis, etc.  However they should have negatives too.<P>Summons are really semi-perm buffs.  Ok lets talk about summons that will get you invited and wanted in groups.<P>From where I sit in the mid level game and upper levels the most common and open slots for items tend to be the neck, ammo, and hands.  Lets keep that in mind.  I also see resistance become more and more important.<P>I would like to armors and items that provide general magic resistances as well as being very light weight.  The higher the summon the better.<P>Why not have summoned rings of magic resistances, cloaks of fire resistances and shields of flame?<BR>I really think these would be great additions to any class that wants to specialize.  Obviously you dont want to invalidate the jewelry trade but summoning a lightweight sheild at level 44 that gives ac 20 and +20 fire resistance and -10 cold resistance (sheild of ice) might be worhtwhile.<P>A cloak of resistance that gives +5 ac and +10 MR might be worth wearing in some cases. Items of course have to be all/all or all/melee all/caster.<P>I know these sound powerfull and they are.  However to balance this aspect out there are 2 choices... make them research/quest so that only the "dedicated" mages have them.  I think this is appropriate.  Players willing to take the time (provided it isnt unreasonable and require half the guild to accomplish) demonstrate and bring value to any group and that should be rewarded.  Sure low level stuff should be relatively availble, but the high end summons should be research or quested.  <P>I wont go into invis rings, and see invis sunglasses because they are addressed many times but I like them too!  They should find there way into the game.<P>A purse that changes copper to silver would be a wonderfull summons.  It could also be scaled so that at the highest level you get a gp to pp summon.  This should also be an reward quest/research item.  Call it a philosophers stone.  1 click converts money being held.  <P>I have lots more ideas, like player written scrolls for roleplaying.  type a message and creates a scroll that can be handed to players...<P>thanks...<P> <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Summon no rent craft containers for the on the craftperson.<P>Higher end bandages that allow bandaging up to 100%.  Now hear me out on this one, this would only allow you to heal out of combat.  If you want to survive fights at any level you need in combat healing.  And it still takes a long time to heal to using bandages.  You would still be better serve by a healer casting a healing spell to restore your health.  Other things could be added like diminishing returns once you were over 50% health so you healed only half as much per bandage.<P>Summon high damage thrown weapons in stacks of 5-10 like shards of frost or knives of fire. 20-30 damage, similar to throwing boulders in usefulness.  I would like these usable by the magician btw just so I can still add some damage while oom (even though my throwing skill isn't that great)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I like the ideas... here are some of my own...<P>1. Ditch the entire Phantom Armor line, replace it (At the same levels) with Summon Armor of the same type. (e.g. Summon Leather at 16, Chain at 29, etc).  Make it summon a Tunic, Legs, Arms, and Helmet.<P>2. Summon Fisherman's Kit - 1 Fishing Pole, 10 Ale.  Or swap out the Pole for 20 bait, something to keep us from using this to make money.<P>3. Not a summon but... VOICE GRAFT!  Give it to us!<P>4. Ring of the Skies - 3AC +10 Agility +5 sv Magic, Effect: Invisibility, Charges: 4 (Face it, Invisibility is unreliable at best)<BR>Staff of the Earth: 1 Handed Blunt, 15 damage, 40 delay, +5 Strength +5 Stamina +5 sv Disease, Effect: Earth Crush (70ish DD and 3 second stun)<BR>Shield of the Seas: 20AC +5 Dexterity +5 Strength +5 sv Cold, Effect: Regeneration, Charges: 4<BR>Bracelet of Flame: 5AC +5 Agility +5 Dexterity +5sv Heat, Lightsource, Effect: Fists of Flame (+~15 Attack rating)<BR>---These 4 are my pride and joy.  They are for each element, and players just might USE them!  If you use them, make them whatever level you want, but don't change their stats to be utterly useless!  I took into account their being NO RENT, and made them better than I originally intended.<P>5. Summon Deck of Cards - Right click on them (52 Charges) and you get a random card. Perhaps put in some code so that no two same cards are ever drawn from the same deck?  Be nice to truly play Blackjack or what have you.<P>All I can get out of my head right now, it's 5 in the morning.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor thank you for asking us =).<P>FUN SPELLS:<P>Summon gift: Summons a random item from the following list, that can be placed visibly on the character: Flowers, scarf, gem with pretty lights, crown/diadem, robe. All items are NORENT, have no sale value and no stats, pure adornation.<P>***************************<BR>Mana-storage-oriented battle-enhancing spells:<P>Summon Armour spell line: Summons a random location piece of armour. <BR>Level 8: cloth value. 40 mana.<BR>Level 16: leather. 80 mana<BR>Level 29: leather with +5 resist. (for example: legs always have 5 resist to poison, arms 5 to disease, etc). 160 mana<BR>Level 39: chain with +2 stat. 320 mana<BR>49: plate with +5 resist and +2 stat. 600 mana<BR>52: plate with +4 stat. 900 mana<BR>56: plate with +15 resist. 1200 mana<BR>60: plate with 15 resist, +4 stat. 1500 mana.<P>Pls note that this spell would be group/pet oriented, as only the low level spell could fit the mage.<P>procing pet weapon line:<P>29: We have the SoS. Nobody uses it after the last change. Before everybody used it. To much damage? perhaps pre-50. post-50? no.<P>39: Proc: renew elements. If it is only to go of once or twice in a combat, 200 hp is not a lot. If it will have the old procing rate, is should be much less.(50 hp?) 200-300 hp healed/combat at level 39 seems reasonable.<P>49: Proc: A spell effect that can interrupt casters. Stun like the Gnoll Hide Lariat seems ok. It has no duration. And it is already available: I always buy these whips for my pet. I can get them for 15 pp. (EC or SK). So it would not be overpowerring the pets, since it is already available. It would just make it more 'magician-like'<P>52: Proc: DD spell. It should be a spell that adds about 300-600 dam per combat. Old proc rate: the level 8 DD perhaps. New proc rate: the level 24 that gives 179 dam. ESSENTIAL: Make it a spell from the SOS line, conjuration based.<P>55: Proc: root. ( I would have asked for snare, but that spell is not in our arsenal already...)<P>60: Proc: stun with a duration. Upgrade to level 49.<P>Basically the idea of this line is:<P>1. Make the magician more powerfull 50+<BR>2. Give some pets a downgraded version of other pets abilities. So I can compose a pet for the right situation: for example an air pet that is able to cast a couple of roots during combat, or an earth pets that gets a few stuns of. Or perhaps an earth pet that is rooting more than ususal (good for saving the casters). Or a fire pet that will regain hp faster like a water pet.<P>Summon Burnout item spell line:<P>Lvl 12: Bracelet: Burnout. 4 charges of BU I. cost: 150 mana. ac 3.<P>Lvl 29: Bracelet: Burnout II. 6 charges of BU II. cost: 460 mana. ac 5.<P>Lvl 49: Bracelet: Burnout III. 8 charges of BU I. cost: 1300 mana. ac 7.<P>Lvl 55 Bracelet: Burnout IV. 8 charges of BU IV. cost: 1300 mana. ac 10.<P><BR>Mana storage spell line:<P>34: Earring: +25 mana. 500 mana to cast.<P>54: ring: + 50 mana. 1000 mana to cast.<P>************************************<BR>DD:<P>Basically replace some of the Evo based DD for Conj based, so that we get a conj based every 10 levels before 50, and dont have to wait from 44 to 57 to get another one. We are mages after all =).<P>************************************<P>Utility:<BR>Make all utility spells Item based, with 2 charges when we get them, and 4 charges on an upgrade that comes 15 levels (or 3 spell levels) later.<P>************************************<P>Dont make items NODROP. We want them so that we can offer the group something. post 50 we are no longer masters of damage, so we need to be able to offer the group something. <P>************************************</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Some of the ideas are great some of them are not so great but then that's just my opinion.<BR>What I would like to see is the Mod Rod having the mana cost of it reduced to like 150 atleast or 100 even to make is useful to the mages that summon them.<BR>The Phantom armor line actually having an appearance of what ever the lvl of it is, Leather for Phantom leather, Chain for Phantom chain and so forth.<BR>As it is now water pets have a high poison resist well the other pets should also have a high resist to something. Like earth pets having a high resist to being rooted, air having a high resist to stuns or mezzes, fire having a high resist to fear or something.<BR>It would be nice if we could summon haste masks like the lvl 56 muzzle spell at lower lvls with a lower haste on them.<BR>A better heal spell for our pets is needed, I'm lvl 46 and most of the things I fight do more dmg to my pet than I can heal it in two or three hits.<BR>I would like to be able to summon armor items for my pets that add to the pets stats and ac.<BR>A dex buff for our pets since the pet patch I only see weapons my pet have proc like once every three or four fights. I have seen a lvl 16 ranger friend of mine with like 90 dex make a weapon proc at least once a fight sometimes 2 or 3 times. Or maybe add a dex buff in with the Burnout series.<BR>More weapons that have a proc on them against things other than summoned. Like undead, animals, cold procs and heat procs, granted the heat and cold shouldn't do as much dmg as the undead summoned and animal ones do cause they can be used on a wider range and have one that works on everything but only have it do like 15 or so dmg. A proc that healed our pet would be pointless with how un often the weapon would proc.<BR>Levitation rings should be changed to either more charges, a lower lvl to get the spell or have a longer duration like the necro spell Dead Man Floating. I mean the other classes, except necros, get levitation spells at way lower lvls we should at least have ours last longer.<BR>At later lvls we should be able to summon a coldstone that lets the wearer be able to see invis along with ultravision and maybe make it no drop.<BR>The bag becoming heavier and not poofing when you go LD is a great idea.<BR>Well that's about it I hope that some of these ideas are at least thought about and read about.<P>Sayen Alot of Hands Of Fate<BR>Magician of the 45th Element<BR>Vallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Lots of great ideas going around here.  However I think that many of them are somewhat rediculous...we should not be able to summon bind/gate stones and summon armor spells would just be useless in my opinion.  <P>I do think that we need more weapons for the pets though...seeing as yet again we are the only class without a slow spell.  Need to make a summoned pet only weapon that procs snare/clinging darkness/or that lvl 12 enchanter slow spell.  We also need a summoned weapon that procs a small DD to replace the sowrd of runes...the SoR is compelty useless now, and has been moved to the back of my spell book.  I was thinking perhaps just replace the proc on the SoR with the lvl 8 DD shock of blades, or what ever it was.  And maybe we could summon a weapon equivilant to a gnoll hide lariot.<P>Another issue that needs looking into is how the pets dex got screwed over.  I gave some SoRs to my pet last night just for fun to see the procs go off...and they only went off ~10 times in an hour!  I realize that pets were probibly procing a little to much in the past, but I think you should at least scale up the dex of pets by spell lvl.  For instance...lvl 49 pet summons should proc just as much as the pets used to before the patch, and lvl 4 pet summons should hardly ever proc a weapon (not that a lvl 4 would actually be giving procing weapons to his pet!).  <P>Yet another good idea would be moving Velocity (the pet SOW spell) down to a much lower lvl, like 34 which is when mages start really kiting big stuff around such as sand giants and griffins.  That might be asking a bit much...but perhaps make a Velocity 2 spell that goes where the current one is and make it faster than Velocity 1. <P>I do like the idea of a summon pet spell...that could let you get your pet past areas with bad pathing problems.  Just park him at the zone, move through to your fighting spot, and summon him.  Another great idea would be to summon a gem that has one charge of a spell that could be called "return home" or something.  It would gate you back to your original bind point outside your races home town.  This would be quite useful, for example when you gain a lvl you can quickly head back home to your guild and use your practice points, then use regular gate to zip back to your fighting spot.  This would be much less powerful than gate 2 and bind 2, which is a little to much conveinience.  If you still see it as overpowering, make the stones no-drop, and have them weight a ton so you can't haul them around to use as an instant escape spell...or just stick a long casting time on it, and perhaps have it use up alot of mana.<P>Another thing I'd like to see is to have the mod-rod improved.  All other classes have mana regen spells but us, and the modulation rod is just isn't very usefull...it costs more mana to summon than it gives you back, uses up alot of HPs.  How about upping the mana return to a 1:1 ratio with the HPs it gives back.  I think its' curently 225 HPs for 150 mana...make it give you 250 mana back, and cost 50 mana to summon.  That would make it an actually feasable form of mana regen to put us on par with other pure casters.  <P>That's all I can think of atm.  I'd like to see at least one new summon to replace the SoR.  Keep the good ideas rolling!<P>Tiiden VandorGriffin,<BR>34th Magician on Rodcet Nife. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is a post I made a while back, and after revising it I just went ahead and tossed it in it's entirety into this message. I got a decent response but I like all of these spells and all of them IMO are worth consideration.<BR>---------<BR>Level 1-<BR>Current Item Conjurations:<BR>Summon Dagger- My only problem with this spell is it has too long a recast time.<BR>Summon Food- Decent Spell<BR>Summon Drink- Decent Spell<P>I have no ideas for new conjurations at this level<P>Level 8-<BR>Current Item Conjurations:<BR>Summon Bandages - Decent spell<BR>Summon Wisp - Not bad but it'd be nice if at certain levels you would begin summoning upgraded light sources that put out more light.<P>I have no ideas for new conjurations at this level<P>Level 12-<BR>Current Item Conjurations:<BR>Dimensional Pocket- Decent Spell<BR>Eye of Zomm- Isn’t really an item but it’s not exactly a pet either. Doesn't last very long, if I were to scout someplace I would just do it myself instead of wasting the small amount of mana to cast this spell and only get a few paces away because the eye aggros anything that would aggro on me anyways. Remove the aggro off this and this would be a useful spell.<BR>Staff of Tracing- Decent Spell<BR>Summon Fang- Decent Spell<P>I have no ideas for new conjurations at this level<P>Level 16-<BR>Current Item Conjurations:<BR>Summon Throwing Dagger- Not Bad Spell<BR>Summon Heatstone- Could be better, if it had an added bonus of +10 resist fire.<BR>Staff of Warding- Decent Spell<P>I have no ideas for new conjurations at this level<P>Level 20-<BR>Current Item Conjurations:<BR>Summon Arrows- Semi-Decent Spell<BR>Summon Waterstone- Good spell since it's no longer LORE.<BR>Spear of Warding- Bad Spell. This spear is nearly never used. I'll go as far to call it worthless at level 20 because it's damage output and delay aren't appealing and the stats on it hardly make up for it. Since only melee'rs and I believe shamans can use it, I never summon this.<P>Spells I'd like to see at level 20:<BR>Summon Ale- Works like Summon Water and summons 1 Ale. But every level you can summon 1 more, so by level 39 you should be able to summon 20.<P>Level 24-<BR>Current Item Conjurations:<BR>Everfount- Good Spell<BR>Cornucopia- Good Spell<BR>Staff of Runes- Decent Spell<P>Spells I'd like to see at level 24:<BR>Dagger of Runes- Summons a 3 dmg/23 delay dagger that procs something like Ward Undead (this would be highly useful since there are a lot more places with undead than there are summoned creatures) and offer a bonus of +4 sv poison and disease. <P>Level 29-<BR>Current Item Conjurations:<BR>Sword of Runes- Decent Spell<BR>Summon Coldstone- Excellent Spell useful all the way up to 60.<P>Spells I'd like to see at level 29:<BR>Dagger of Aid- Summons a dagger of around 3 dmg/22 delay and procs something like Minor Healing(Self) and offer a bonus of 3ac and +3 sv poison and disease. <P>Hand of the Forager- Works like Forage and uses Conjuration skill as the limiting factor. Summons items available to Forage depending on the zone. Mages don't have any spells that work in hand with any trade skill and I feel that this would be a help in allowing mages to work in brewing without begging forage-enabled classes for what we need.. even though brewing isn't much of a moneymaking skill it would be a step in the right direction.. plus for once maybe we could summon some food that doesn't disappear (since it was foraged!)<P>Level 34-<BR>Current Item Conjurations:<BR>Dimensional Hole- Decent Spell<BR>Staff of Symbols- Decent Spell<P>Spells I'd like to see at level 34:<BR>Eyes of the Elemental- When your pet is told to "Guard Here" it will stay where it is and face the nearest NPC. This spell would work like Identify and reveal what NPC the pet is being drawn to. Not place it on target, but show it in chat window. Surely if your pet can answer to "Who is leader" it has the ability to speak so it should have no problem telling you what it senses in the distance.<P>Level 39-<BR>Current Item Conjurations:<BR>Dagger of Symbols- Decent Spell<BR>Ring of Flight- Good Spell. It would be nicer if:<BR>A) The ring would disappear once the two charges are used up.<BR>B) Gain a charge for every 5 levels past 39.<P>Spells I'd like to see at level 39:<P><BR>Level 44-<BR>Current Item Conjurations:<BR>Modulating Rod- Decently useful spell.<P>Spells I'd like to see at level 44:<BR>Vine of the Earth- Summons a 1HS whip of around 8 dmg/26 delay that procs Ensnaring Roots and has +5 sta. None/none (pet only)<P>Level 49-<BR>Current Item Conjurations:<BR>NONE<P>Spells I’d like to see at level 49:<BR>Rod of Words- Summons a rod of around 10 dmg/29 delay and procs something like Bramblecoat (using the element of Fire or Ice instead of Plants) which would stack with dmg shields and offer a bonus of +6 sv fire and ice.<P>Level 51-<BR>Current Item Conjurations:<BR>Gift of Xev- Decent Spell.<P>Spells I’d like to see at Level 51:<BR>Wand of Far Sight- Summons a wand that offers a bonus of +2 int and only wieldable by pure casters (Mag, Enc, Nec, Wiz) and would allow a spells distance modifier to be boosted by 10-20 feet. *I’m not sure if this is possible, but I’ve NEVER seen this idea suggested.. may just be my failure to see, but I think this would be a decent effect. It’s not asking for a spell haste.. just the ability to cast a little bit further as long as you hold it either of your melee slots.*<P>Level 52-<BR>Current Item Conjurations:<BR>Bristlebane’s Bundle- Decent Spell. There are small problems I have such as The Spinning Bottle needs to be EXPENDABLE as do Fireworks. Insta-destroy them once they are used. They are already NO RENT, it’s not like you can hold onto them forever and why would you want to?<P>Spells I’d like to see at Level 52:<BR>Summon Froststone- Summons an EXPENDABLE stone that has an effect that raises ice resistance up 20.<P>Summon Flamestone- Summons an EXPENDABLE stone that has an effect that raises fire resistance up 20.<P>Level 53-<BR>Current Item Conjurations:<BR>Quiver of Marr- Not a lot of people use arrows and I’m not sure of the stats on these arrows as I do not have it but I would imagine that in order to make this appealing to anyone (because more archery-enabled people fletch their own arrows) is to have a very high range 200-250 or so and the downside would be low dmg 1-3 dmg.. would be very useful for pulls which is basically all arrows are ever used for at high levels as far as I am told.<P>Spells I’d like to see at Level 53:<BR>Summon Earthstone- Summons an EXPENDABLE stone that has an effect that raises poison and disease resistance up 20.<P>Claw of the Elements- Summons a claw of around 7 dmg/22 delay that procs something like Shock of Blades (35 dmg) and offers +10 sv magic. None/None (pet-only)<P>Level 54-<BR>Current Item Conjurations:<BR>Bandoleer of Luclin- Semi-Decent Spell.<P>Spells I’d like to see at level 54:<BR>Summon Airstone- Summons an EXPENDABLE stone that has an effect that raises magic resistance up 30.<P>Staff of Swords- Summons a 1HB staff (mage-only and NO DROP) that is +6 int, +8 sv fire, cold, and magic. Effect would be something like Shock of Swords that could be activated by right clicking the staff. *This spell isn’t like a normal spell drop, it would drop off a specific mob like the Summon Corpse spell.. but be recognized as a weapon that is simply NO RENT and requires resummoning.*<P>Level 55-<BR>Current Item Conjurations:<BR>Pouch of Quellious- Semi-Decent spell<P>Spells I’d like to see at Level 55:<BR>Essence of Stone- Summons a stone that when held in range slot or melee slots forms the wielder into an earth elemental. (Mage-only NO DROP) the stone grants all the benefits so the form being taken as well as +4 int, +5 sta, and +15 sv poison and disease and is activated when worn.<P>Level 56-<BR>Current Item Conjurations:<BR>Muzzle of Mardu- Decent spell, and as far as I hear it’s pretty nice to have.<P>Spells I’d like to see at level 56:<BR>Essence of Flame- Summons a stone that when held in range slot or melee slots forms the wielder into an fire elemental. (Mage-only NO DROP) the stone grants all the benefits so the form being taken as well as +4 int, +2 agi, and +20 sv fire and is activated when worn.<P>Greater Ring of Flight- Summons a levitation ring that is activated when worn. (This would be a possible solution to the Ring of Flight we get at 39 having only 2 charges). Alternatively the ring would have around 10 charges.<P>Level 57-<BR>Current Item Conjurations:<BR>NONE<P>Spells I’d like to see at Level 57:<BR>Essence of Air- Summons a stone that when held in range slot or melee slots forms the wielder into an air elemental. (Mage-only NO DROP) the stone grants all the benefits so the form being taken as well as +4 int, +2 agi, and +20 sv magic and is activated when worn.<P>Flail of the Elements- Summons a 1HB flail of around 9 dmg/24 delay that procs something like Stun that lasts for 5-8 seconds and offers +10 sv magic, fire, and cold. None/None (pet-only)<P>Level 58-<BR>Current Item Conjurations:<BR>NONE<P>Spells I’d like to see at Level 58:<BR>Essence of Water- Summons a stone that when held in range slot or melee slots forms the wielder into an water elemental. (Mage-only NO DROP) the stone grants all the benefits so the form being taken as well as +4 int, +2 str, and +20 sv cold and is activated when worn.<P>Crown of Elemental Renewal- Summons a crown that offers +6 int, +3 str, +15 sv fire, cold, magic and has a regeneration effect on it. *Like the staff of swords, this would be considered an armor drop but in the form of a spell.* (Mage-only NO DROP).<P>Level 59-<BR>Current Item Conjurations:<BR>NONE<P>Spells I’d like to see at Level 59:<BR>Eye of the Elements- Summons a range slot item that offers +2 to all stats, +5 to all resistances, and has a See invis/Ultravision combo that is activated by wearing (there has to be some sort of spell like that, and if there is not then there needs to be one).<P>Level 60-<BR>Current Item Conjurations:<BR>NONE<P>Spells I’d like to see at Level 60:<BR>Rod of Wrath- Summons a 1HB rod of around 15 dmg/30 delay that offers +5 str, dex, agi, +5 sv to all resistances, and casts Shock of Spikes (176 dmg). This would be none/none pet only and would be really cool if it was a quest weapon.. a Quest weapon for pets (there’a a new idea!) and I feel this is balanced for something you would be able to conjure at level 60!<P>Argaile Talismar<BR>53 Elementalist of Xev<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>If you read through all the posts regarding issues with mages I think you will see that their are 3 fundamental problems mages have with their class:<P>1) We are not desirable in groups.<BR>- I do not think this is true.  Now of course we are not as important in grouping as Clerics, Warriors, Enchanters, and maybe one or 2 other classes, but then again they do not have the solo power that we do.  So this is where things level out.  But in groups we have very high damage power, damage shields, and even have pets that act as backup tanks (or sometimes primary).<P>2) We do not have a crowed control method.<BR>This is very true.  Mages are probably the only casting class that has no way to control Mobs.  We need some form of root or snare so that we are able to get out of bad situations, or even solo 2 or 3 spawn spots.  <P>-To do this I recommend that we get the ability to summon some form of (web) jar.  Then we can stack these jars in our ranged slot and throw them at Mobs.  If you feel this will unbalance things make it have a spell component (say a spider web, or some gem).  But this would help our class SO much.  Please consider it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>3) We have no mana regen ability.<P>- This is true and probably the easiest one to fix.  All you have to do is adjust our summon line of armor to include a very small mana regen component.  After all, we do have to already pay for the stones that we use to create it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>So I hope this helps you figure out a way to help our class a bit.  Thanks so much for the time you spend on this and other important matters.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I like that idea.<P>I can't think of anywhere that pets get stuck due to size, so it would be a spell purely for fun.<P><BR>Also, could we have the waterstone turned into a ring, or circlet?

</FONT><HR>I would love to see a mage harvest some form of their own power.  Giving a reward for increased downtime.  <P>For example, I have just gotten to the level that I am able to specialize.  I got a new spell at this level that summons a "harvesting stone" or "Harvesting rod". There are 2 versions here. <P>  Version one(which I like best)<BR>In versoin one the rod is no drop, no rent.<BR>I then sit and med to full mana.  Once full I right click the rod.  (As long as I am not targetted) the rod will cast a spell and *all* my mana will vanish.  Allow this rod to suck up an amount of mana in direct proportion to the mage's level and skill in a speicific specializtion, and allow it to absorb 25% of that number with every 'full' absorbtion.   When I target myself and right click it, the rod releases that mana in a form of a wizard's "harvest spell" and gives me that percentage back<BR> <BR>   Version Two:<BR>Each harvesting rod summoned only holds mana equal to 50% of the mana it cost to summon and it should cost the same as a pet of the current level to summon.  For example, a mage of level 200 would summon a rod with 200 mana and it would hold 100 mana, not enough to store a pet of even level 12 calibur.  Next allow it to be self cast only and no drop.  This means a mage can store their damage shields and their buff shields, etc. and pass them out.  Depending on the mages specialization in the spell he's trying to store in the rod determines the success and of course the mana limit determines the charges.<P>Finally if that #2 is unbalancing, if the spell is passed out to someone too low to use it (Ie: A level 60 mage could store 250 mana/1 charge of Phantom Armor-Level 52 and give it to a level 1) then have it say "This spell is too powerful for you" as if an enchanter tries to cast Clarity2 on a low level...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As Ive said before, I think mages should deal most of their damage through their pets.  I think that we should be able to summon items to enahance the damaging capabilities and performance of our pets.  I know Ive posted some weapon suggestions before, but in the light of this post, I would like to put them up once again.  I apologize to those who have seen my previous post.  Just some ideas...really wish mages would support the pet weapon idea.<P>LvL 20-Venemous Fang (dagger):Proc Weak Poison<P>LvL 24-Sword of Runes (1hs):Proc VS Summoned<P>LvL 34-Fire and Ice (2 1hs swords) Fire procs around 50dd fire damage/Cold procs around 50dd cold damage<P>LvL 39-Sword of the Guardian Element (1hs):Proc Elemental Armor<P>LvL 44-Dagger of the Shielded (dagger):Proc Resist Magic<P>LvL 49-Staff of the Feeble Mind (2hb):Proc Mem blur<P>LvL 51-Sword of Mardu (1hs):Proc Haste<P>LvL 55-Gift of Ykesha (1hs):Proc Ykesha<P>LvL 59-Elemental Guardian (1hb):Proc Renew Elements<P>I wish Verant would gear item summonings towards our pets.  By the time we get item summonings they seem obsolete for PCs of equivalent lvls.  Procing weapons would provide utility without throwing mages out of balance.  Please consider a new line of pet weapon summons...and please increase the dexterity on pets to make procing weapons useful.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>     A lot of these suggestions are good. Voice graft would be nice for periods of resting.  The tanks like to play with our pets and it would be funny if the pets could growl back at them or exchange insults, or even suggest to the tank that he consider that rude gesture the next time that mean green frogs pops and the tank is low on hp.<P>     I honestly can’t think of many things mages should be able to summon that would help more without infringing on other classes. I do think we need more items, however, or a way to make money like some of the other classes can.  Bandages aren’t really useful post 50 unless you are just fighting outdoors in a relaxed way. Trying to bandage a tank that has thousands of hps takes too long. Food items and bags aren’t very useful either. Its nice to be able to summon them all at once and they are great for newer characters but we cant put items into the bags because of the linkdeaths. A much better version of the coldstone would be nice though, maybe something along the lines of acumen. Yes we definitely need more charges on lev rings and waterstones.<P>     We need to be more group friendly. Right now playing in a group all I can do for them is damage shield and fire direct damage. Sometimes I can make a pet, but its getting to where pets are more and more undesirable because of pathing problems. So for just dd a group would prefer a wizard because they can at least teleport everyone out in case there is trouble. And as far as the samage shield goes, driuds are just as good as ours unless the group needs fire resistance.<P>     I think we need more items to even things out among the classes. Some of the classes get items that cast without using mana. I know shamans have a bracer and while it only casts about 250 damage, they don’t have to use mana for it, and that along with their too easy epic quest weapon is just too much. They now have a bracer and an epic weapon that will do almost 1500 dmg without mana. That really isn’t fair. And I do know the shaman epic quest is easy because I have helped complete three. <P>     A lot of the other classes have ways to make their mana regen. We definitely need something like that. I never did understand why shamans got to wince.<P>     As for some way for mages to make money…. There are many classes that have specific ways to have an income enchanters with jewelry, clerics with reses, druids and wizards with teleports, shamans with their potions. Isnt there some way mages could be included in some wealth? Maybe summon ppl from other zones to us? I was hoping some of the trade skills could help but the only time that really happened was at the beginning of EQ when ppl had to buy armor. The only trade skill that really works now is jewelry. <P>     Some of the spells we have been given were really great. I love the summon monster and spin the bottle but  these are really for fun though and aren’t practical. I hope to many more aren’t added though because it might start to seem as if mages were the jokers of the classes, and while that isn’t a bad thing it is my opinion that, that honor should be left to the rogues. <P>Spicey &lt; Amber Order&gt;<BR>53rd mage E’ci<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
