</FONT><HR>Why do Rangers have such low hitpoints?  Are hitpoints going to let us tank?  NO!  With our extremely low AC, we will never be tanks again, post 50.  More hitpoints however, will make us more survivable.  We will be able to last long enough to get off that last jolt, or survive until we can be healed.  Rangers are the ONLY melee class that did NOT get a hitpoint bonus at 51.  Please increase our hitpoints.  I mean, honestly, should a sneaky, backstabbing thief (rogues) have more hitpoints than a class that has a warrior as a parent class?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't know if any of these have been covered yet (don't have time to read a gazillion posts &lt;g&gt; ), but anyway here's my suggestions,<P>1) Add Firefist at lvl 22 (already on test woowooo)<P>2) Move Superior Camo to 39. You want people to move into dungeons that aren't used. Well since dungeons are rarely crawled when joining a group we need to get to the camp. This would provide a way to do it in some dungeons. By lvl 49 almost everything in that lvl range dungeon sees through it anyway. This would be a nice addition for L Guk live side, Droga, and Paw to name a few. Moving it lower would be even nicer.<P>3) Add a innate resist to all melee types say 2 per 5 lvls nothing majory unbalancing. It's just impossible to keep high ac, str, dex, and hp, yet maintain good resists to boot. Caster basically worry about int or wis (cha if an enc) everything else is far less important. 99% of all groups I'm in never cast resist buffs either since it just adds to every other buff they gotta keep track of. Anyway here's what I was thinking,<P>Your resist increase 2 per 5 lvls (if warriors are higher keep there the same way)<P>Warrior - Magic<BR>Monks - Magic or Fire (mind over matter kinda thing)<BR>Rogues - Poison (they use it why not resist it?)<BR>Paladins - Disease (they are the melee version of Clerics)<BR>Shadow Knights - Poison or Disease (Melee version of death aka Necros)<BR>Rangers - 1 point each of fire and cold instead of  2points into 1 (outdoorsmen good with elements)<BR>Bards - Cold (well there was Nordic Bards makes I guess /shrug)<P>Well just some suggestions the most it would increase any class resistance would be by 24.<P>Weyoon Wyldheart<BR>45th Ranger of Tunare<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&lt;DIV ALIGN=JUSTIFY&gt;<BR>Hail all!  I play a Ranger of the 12th season on Tunare, so many of the higher level problems are beyond my scope.  But, I would like to state how I feel from what I have heard, so I will make this brief.<P>Back when I played AD&D, I always chose the Elven Ranger as my character race/class.  Why?  My dexterity bonus allowed me to duel wield like no other class in AD&D.  The Elven long bow bonus plus my dex bonuses also allowed me to wield a bow like nobody else.  To boot, I had spells.<P>So, why did I play Rangers...what was my role?  I was always the 'tactical support' for the group.  I would make my way to the outside of the group to pelt strategic targets with arrows and spells, watch for incoming mobs seeking to corner us, and then throw the occasional heal whenever one of us got into trouble.<P>Why did I just say all that?  None of the 'classic' reasons for playing a Ranger seem to exist in EverQuest.  From what I have heard from higher level Rangers, our ability to use a bow is pretty much no better than all the other bow-wielding classes and is especially nowhere near the damage output level of our own melee ability--much less that of another melee class'.<P>&lt;FONT COLOR="#0000C0"&gt;So, what would I like to see?  I would like to see some kind of increase in our Archery abilities to increase our overall ranged damage output from our bow and spells to better match and compete with the melee output of tanks.<P>Aside from buffing our ranged abilities, perhaps we could be given a buff on our Fletching ability with the introduction of a set of crafted Ranger only arrows.  These arrows might possibly then be part of a quest to be enchanted to give them different spell procs (similar to the Trueshot -&gt; Rain Caller quest).&lt;/FONT&gt;<P>Well, that is all that I have to say, so I will close.  I hope that my suggestions actually make sense.  Thank you for your time.&lt;/DIV&gt;<P>&lt;FONT COLOR="#004000"&gt;Galandil of the Lesser Faydark<BR>Champion of the Faydark<BR>[Tunare Server]&lt;/FONT&gt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Let me start off by saying I love most of te stuff that the are working on with test seems like its a good idea. Wondering if this can be changed or added or something, but rangers get Cholorplast at Level 55, Druids get it at 44, and Shamans get it at 39. Druids get Regen at level 34, Shamans get regen at level 24, and rangers don't get it. It seems like Rangers, for the most part, get there spells 10-14 levels after Druids. I suggest moving the Druids regeneration to level 24, Shamans regen to level 19 and introducing Rangers with regen at level 30 or 39. Its a spells that wouldn't overpower, and its another chip rangers can use to get into group. Tell me your thoughts.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wow I've seen alot of posts and the one I agree with the most are.<P>1)Defensive skills. Dodge parry reposte type skills need work. I think should be linked to agi stat and wieght somehow? keep in mind when we get hit it will hurt alot. since our HP and AC is still way low.<P>2) Give us a little more damage perhaps tying to a crit type hit when reposte works? And reposte only works if skill and stats add up right. ie make agi mean something for a ranger.<P>3) fix the bow.. stop missing, and why can I cast snared or flame lick to pull when I cannot shoot arrows? Maybe this is good cause it means we can pull from spots where warriors cannot shoot arrows?<P>4) Really good idea I saw was magic arrows adding small spells? Blindness, slow , etc. that maybe wont last too long. meaning if we are far away enough to shoot the slow arrow we are not gainning the effect to melee so we could not use it for an added solo benefit? meaning we would have to constantly be hitting with the special slow arrow and wouldn't be part of the melee? Just an example, other magic arrows would be nice too like blind arrow or snare arrow or flame lick arrow and such.. small spells would add more roleplaying to rangers. Tying the magic arrows to very good fletch skill and components like the rogues poison?? or add poison to arrows if right component was added while making the magic arrows would create the special no drop arrows for rangers only.<P>5) Charm animal with a special component forage no drop only? Say I give the bear some really good berries he becomes my friend for life ). Also ranger only ) talk about good roleplaying.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Verant has already stuck their foot in their mouth when Abashi stated that every fix is considered by Verant to be an enhancement, regardless of whether it is a bug fix or a fix to make something operate better.<P>Gate/Bind/Port/whatever are class defining skills for the druid class (and wizard).  Adding this does not only enhance the ranger class but also fixes the balance issue relating to the problem with the ranger not receiving the class defining spells/skills from the casting parent class.<P>Guys, we didn't get a class defining spell/skill from our casting parent class.  This is unlike the SK and Paladin that received at least one of the most powerful spells from their casting parents spell-line.<P>The paladin gets resurrection.  They also have enough buffs that they can grant a high degree of AC buff and a high degree of HP buff.  In fact, when totalling the HP buff a paladin gets they can cast 975 additional HP on themselves.  In addition to this they have the naturally high defense and they have the enhance HP.<P>The SK received the level 44 necro pet and with the current enhancements even their necro pet can double attack and dual wield without the need for weapons.  Their pets hit harder the the average ranger at levels 50-55.  On top of this they can 2hs with a double attack and be doing a huge amount of damage during battle.  Yes, pets are hard to control, but they aren't impossible to control.  Every pet caster deals with controlling their pets.<P>The ranger received nothing along these lines, in fact they received almost no type of increases in any fashion in the post kunark world.  Only months later did they change that.<P>For me, a serious problem regarding balance, is that the ranger class did not recieve any class defining skill/spell from their parent caster class.  Their archery and tracking are not class defining skills for the ranger as 6 other classes can snare a mob in one way or another.  There are two other classes that can track and both do it better.<P>It seems appropriate that if a paladin can rez someone and can buff with symbols and reso, as well as other AC and HP buffs that stack, then it seems appropriate that the ranger class get some sort of ports and bind.<P>I read Absor's response regarding gate and bind and it seems that he is unwilling to take our thoughts back to the tuning team.  Gates and bind are on our mind.  It is what we consider to be a balancing issue.  Why on earth would Absor choose to just crumple our idea up and throw it into the trash.  This is irresponsible and it does very little in opening the line of communication and in furthering diplomacy between the players and the harsh company called Verant.<P>It is wrong of Absor to present his ideas.  It is impossible for the tuning team to get an idea of what we are talking about if he does not take our ideas, all of them, to the tuning team and let them sift through it.<P>Also, I want to make a comment about how he prioritized (or his lack of prioritization) of ideas we came up with.<P>The most overwhelming response that was given to them to date was the lack of HP and the lack of AC via the defense skill.  These have been givens from the initial Kunark release.  If we fought so hard for them from then till now, why is he focusing on the Jolt spell as being his highest priority item.  If he isn't then why didn't he take the time to show how he was going to prioritize the issues with the tuning team.<P>He has also excluded many other things that were brought up by players that would bring the rangers closer to balance.  To be sure, they have bastardized the game to the point that many of the classes can never be balanced again.  With the release of Velious this is proven true a thousand-fold.<P>Anyway, my two cents is that Absor isn't doing us the justice we need by excluding our ideas because he doesn't understand them.  In nothing he wrote did he show that he understood them.  He even referred to some of them as "thing".  ...this thing or that thing.  He didn't even identify them as serious issues that we'd brought up.<P>He's just making a list, he's not understanding our point of view.  Nothing I read in what he wrote told me that he understood our point of view on any of them.<P>Gate/ports and bind are important balancing issues just as Resurrection and pets were balancing issues for the Paladin and SK.<P>Geez, Absor, at least get it right and try to show us that you understand why.<P>And no, Absor, I don't believe you guys were paying attention when you made the changes on test.  Some of those changes were discussed in other threads, but the adding of endure this or endure that...was that a priority for the players that post here for ranger balance issues?  I think not.  That shows us that you guys were not listening to our thread and that you did make the changes on test without the input of the ranger class regarding balance.  Tell me, how does endure cold balance the ranger class at the low level that it is received?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Rangers tracking is BROKEN.  The only response to this I've seen from Absor (damn, but this stuff takes some digging!) strongly suggests that he all but sees it pretty much "working as intended".  Well, it's NOT, unless it's intended to be "broken".  Allow me to offer an example.<P>When I enter the Qeynos front gate zone from Qhills, and hear Fippy give his zone-wide cry (come on now, say it together!), he doesn't come up on tracking.  Two separate checks of it while running into town will show me the gate guards (who I recognize by name all the way on the other side of the zone) as well as Sneed Galliway, but _NOT_ Fippy.  FREQUENTLY I will then find Fippy (I know his trails well) myself and dispatch him.  Tracking will frequently NOT ONCE show him while I do this since I hit level 12 (13?).<P>Now, by any LOGICAL implementation of how tracking is supposed to work, I _SHOULD_ be able to see Fippy, especially if he's just popped into the zone.  Why can't I?  Is this working as intended?  Absor's response suggests there's no bug here.  Excuse me?!<P>I don't know how tracking was "intended" to work, but here's my two coppers.  The stuff on tracking should be ranked by relative distance and recent activity.  Ideally, chosing between either of the two should be our option, and we should have a scroll-bar or some OTHER means of deciding WHAT we're looking for.  I understand server-loading issues and communication issues, but there are TONS of clever ways to get around these.<P>From my perspective, tracking is HORRIBLY unreliable after skill level 65.  It's an overkill amount of uncontrollable information.  I'm pulling up mobs that could be on the other friggin' side of the zone, but my list is a subset of my tracking range info and the information I get tells me nothing of the distances involved.  This is not unlike many since improved-upon areas and skills-- there's a LOT of room for improvement here.<P>Please don't tell me any of this can't be done because of X if you're not going to at least let me know something of what CAN be done-- this information in turn helps us make more useful suggestions.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As a longtime ranger player on Bristlebane I've been following the discussion and have a few ideas for everyone.<P>One, since its not likely that Spirit of the Wolf will get a level reduction for rangers, how about a new spell thats lower level.   Say a "Spirit of the Young Pup" that gives JourneymansBoots speed at level 20.   This would be an approach not do different to whats been done to help enchanters with the breeze-clarity line of spells.    I see the ranger class as missing an outdoor movement enhancing spell just when they would get the strength, abilities, etc to go explorin.<P>Two, Something must be done to archerys low end damage.   Bows that drop from Dragons coupled with arrows that cost several platinum pieces each shouldn't be hitting for 1 point of damage except in the rarest of cases.<P>And finally Hide and Sneak.   I think the current level caps on these are a tad low for the master outdoorsman and hunters that we are supposed to be.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Could we all start a collection to buy someone at VI a clue? Here's what needs to be changed for rangers:<P>1) Offense/Defense caps for rangers should be 252/230 (paladins/SK's are 230/252, by comparison, seems that the flip/flop for rangers would be more than fair).<BR>2) Give us better AC items. It's rediculous that shamans can have a better AC than a ranger.<BR>3) Give us more HP, it will allow us to live longer and hopefully eliminate the opinion that rangers are mana sponges. Does it really make sense that a rogue has more hit points than a ranger?<BR>4) Fix tracking. Give us a scroll bar, and allow us to sort by range. And I want to stress this: This is a bug fix, not an enhancement. Making tracking more flexible is a bug fix geared toward rangers, and by no means a distinct improvement. You're not fooling any ranger on any server by saying the opposite.<BR>5) Fix archery. Archery is good only for pulling. Fix the line of sight issues, eliminate the rediculous 'your target is too high/low' messages, give is crippling hits, give us double/triple attacks with a bow, give us the ability to do the same amount of damage as a rogue's backstab with a new archery ability (call it a 'targetted shot'). Hell, if you did this, you could leave our HP, AC, and defense where it is, I'd be just fine standing back pegging that dragon in the eye 'til he's brain dead. Plus, this would give the ranger a really cool, unique ranger only ability (rangers have no unique abilities as it stands now).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok<BR>Now I want to cover 1HS weapons and Armor that we share with Druids.<P>This would be an issue roughly for Levels 15 to 35.<P>1. Armor the range Quest cape is (Jaggedpine) is both a druid and a ranger cloak.<BR>This is a ranger quest given out by a ranger.<BR>Now the one reason I have an issue with this is because we share it with the druids, the AC gets lowered to be balanced with the druids.<BR>This means Druids get a great cloak with AC better then their regular cloak. <BR>Rangers get a cloak with a DEX buff that is less AC then their banded cloak.<BR>If we got an Ivy etched cloak, it would not be so bad, but we don't.<BR>There is no reason why we should be sharing armor with druids, please stop doing so.<BR>Please create an Ivy etched cloak, or a ranger only cloak for the Mid 20's to mid 30's.<BR>There may be other armor examples, I only know about this one at this time.<P>2. Shared 1HS:<BR>It is bad enough that druids get 1HS, but to have Druid/ranger weapons is unfair to rangers.<BR>The weapons are all for levels 20 to 35 and make up over 50% of the 1HS weapons that rangers can use at these levels.<BR>In order for Druids to use these weapons they have to be balanced for their class.<BR>That means higher DLY and lower DMG then if they were rangers only.<BR>This tends to unbalance us at these levels because the weapons are created with Druids class balance in mind and not rangers.<BR>Now I am not talking much in the way of stats here, but let me show example:<P>1HS Ranger/Druid<BR>DLY 40  DMG 10<P>1HS Ranger only<BR>DLY 39  DMG 10<P>1HS Ranger only<BR>DLY 40  DMG 11<P>This is only a fictional example, and is only used to show the possible difference in base stats.<P><BR>3. 1HB and 2HB:<BR>I don’t think any of these weapons are an issue, I have not seen any that are Ranger/Druid only.<BR>Also these type weapons are more for a caster class, then a Melee Class.<BR>There may be issues here, I just have not discovered any.<P>The point here is some of the imbalance of the ranger class is in sharing to many resources with the druids.<BR>The druids are very powerful Level 1 to 50 and rule the EQ world in these levels, and that’s ok.<BR>That and they really get pissed off because they can't be #1 post 50.<BR>(my heart really bleeds for all those script kiddies out there)<BR>But in order to share any item with them, the items will always be less affective for rangers, least the Druids become more powerful with the item.<P>Thank You<BR>TeTalonUNIX is "user-friendly", it's just particular about who it's friends are....<P>"I see stupid people they're everywhere, they walk around like everyone else they don't even know that they're dumb."<P>You are either a part of the problem, or a part of the soultion.<BR>You have already taken a stance, so what have you chosen to be.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

This would greatly improve the use of fireworks in the game plus I could turn the damage from the arrows into a fire based attack/DoT/Stack Firedamage on top of base damage. Also I think it would be cool to see rangers shooting arrows that have the visual effect of fireworks/mage nuke spells. <P>Also being able to fletch arrows with rope or specail twine that would enable the arrow to proc snare or root if successfull. <P>I don't think this would dramatically change anything currently in the game because we get snare/root at low levels as it is, but being able to run while shooting these arrows makes a diffence instead of standing still and casting them.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is a Copy if a previous post that Absor did not get to because of all the blatent repeating going on on the boards.  Please read this when time permits Absor and I appreciate the time you are spending looking into these issues:<P>Through the two plus years I have played a ranger I have often wondered whythey do not receive safe fall in out door zones or safe fall preiod.<BR>Rangers by definition are the physical masters of the outdoor while druids are the mental. Being a physical master of the outdoor I would think that<BR>rangers should/would be able to traverse rocky and hilly landscape unscathed very quickly and without harm or use of spells (levitate). It never really made since to me why a bard would receive this skill but a master of the outdoors would not.<BR>Rangers are supposed to be masters of the outdoor domain, where many high drops and ledges are persistant. A ranger, being highly skilled at hunting all manner of outdoor creatures, should be abel to traverse any area in which his prey lurks unscathed after having practiced his trade for many years (levels).<P>Lets put this into perspective. Forest rangers are very adept at climbing and descending hills at a high rate of pace. So are first responders, firefighters that fight in national parks, mountainclimbers (with the use of gear obviously...and I wouldn't be opposed to having to use a piece of gear...perhaps equipped in your hand slot for the travel in areas - dunno), and all sorts of outdoor thrill seekers. tell me where are ranger, by role playing values and stories, would not fit into any one of these real life scenarios. The fact is that that is what they match most and these people are able to do these things all the time.<P>People of the hunting background are also able to scale mountains and steep terrain with great effectiveness.<P>I think most of you are thinking along the lines of safe fall being like a jedi trick from Episode One. I urge you to open your thought process on this for just a second and see the bigger picture.<P>Though rangers would obviously not use the skill in the same way as a rogue would it still fits what they are made to do. Be the masters of their domain, the outdoors. I mean come on don't any of you find it silly that a person that spends his whole life in the wilderness would not be able to climb down a mountain at a higher pace then a wizard without injury to himself?<P>Safefall is the answer to this. Though it would not be used in the roleplay sense that a rogue uses it it still fits quite well. I am sure if you take the time to think about it you'll see what I mean.<P>Some people argue that it does not make sense that a ranger would practice the art of safefall, but I have to disagree. Frontier Mountains, Dagnor's Cauldron, lake Rathetear are all zones where you would definitely find a ranger. I would think that a ranger would be able to traverse these types of terrain where they hunt, specifically going down hill, better then a wizard, magician, paladin, (insert other classes except rogue here). Often times I fall for damage going down mountains (essentially from a roleplaying perspective scaling down it) and have to think to myself, "what was that all about".<P>Another point: I think that rangers should get resist cold at the minimum...maybe at level 49, 50 or 51. Again being a master of the outdoors I think that a natural affinity to cold occurs there. We get that 5 point buff for being a ranger but I don't think that that is quite enough. I do not think that we should get cold based attack though. That is pushing the envelope quite a bit.<P>Ranger of the 50th level<BR>Rodcet<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am disturbed whith the path it appears varent is taking with our class.  Increase our offense, give more spells.  The problem I see is defence.  You are only making it worse by increasing our agro!!  I aggree with the previous posts suggesting our defensive skill be equal to other hybrids offense skills, it makes sense.  If not that then try the other idea of increasing our dodge and parry skills as we are suposed to be agile and wear lighter armor, this also would make sense.  Evade would be cool too but not needed if one of the other two suggestions is put in place.  Archery, we are no better at it than any other class that can use it and this is just stupid.  We are suposed to the the archery kings (or queens *GRIN*) at it!!  Lots of good ideas were already posted to improve this, use some of them.  Fix the bug with archery so that it works if there is a bit of an incline or decline.  It sucks only being able to use my bow on open plains type territory.  Make us more effective outdoors with higher speed, allow us to befriend animals (kinda like having a pet but not a summoned one) for example.  We should be able to bind (self only) outdoors as well, not anywhere but outdoors.  I have had fun with my ranger but will likely start using him to springboard some new characters I recently created the retire him.  Without some significant improvements I just think they are the weakest class other than a warrior to play.  I hope varent does something and does it soon.  Take care all and good hunting :-)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>FORM OF THE BEAR !!!!<P>Ok, I know this has never been brought up in this discussion Absor. You wanted roleplaying back-ups for our suggestions so here it is. Give rangers a buff called Form of the Bear. We can cast this buff on any target. Effect - huge HP boost, damage boost (maybe AC boost - not sure about this)...but and here's the kicker...you can't cast any spells while in this form. Full melee classes would love this spell and it would allow rangers to temporarily act as a tank - we give up our spell casting ability for a short time in exchange for being a tank (nice balance for our versatility). And it would make us more wanted in groups as we could buff the fighters.<P>Apart from being a nice class specific buff it would be really neat to see a bunch of bears fighting some mobs. Who wants to be a stupid wolf anyway? Make me a bear - they are cooler animals  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>Longetalos</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Even with the last hybred exp fix , I have had a problem with groups. <P>Example I guide a new group into Crystal Caverns Doing spiders. I think we have a great time, No one dies lotsa exp. good group messages to all. We own the room. <P>Next night I go see same group in room been there this time without me guiding them. <P>(BTW getting to know the area without maps and how to break spawns in room and asuch cost me 8 deaths in 2 days.) <P>Anyway back to discussion, I hail all and say wow you guy broke room and are all setup can I get into group? (seeing they have an empty spot) <P>Everyone sends me tells except warrior saying they wish they could but warrior think I am not needed anymore and would leave if I join?<P>Hummm.. seems the whole group did still chose an obnoxious person that happened to be a warrior over me.. I asked why.. they all said that they didn't think they could keep a ranger alive the same as they did the warrior and room would be lost. Now I am lvl 37 and warrior was lvl 36 twinked. So what does this tell you? <P>BTW I have grouped with all people in the group since that night and all have appologized for the incident as I am technically a better player.. <BR>Just that in general warrior's characters are soo much better for the situation than the ranger and the greed was high for the drops in the room. Can I blame them not really.. so who do I blame for this very bad night of gaming?<P>VERANT<BR>Please fix the Ranger so that a full group can have a choice if the person plays the character correctly.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I've seen a lot of posts on this and previous ranger talk threads and I have to mention one thing before I voice my ideas.  These are supposed to be forums for balancing the ranger class with other classes while bringing them equally up to par. This is not a forum for you to voice what things you think would make the ranger class more attractive to play to you or anyone else.  I could go on to cite the silliness of requests for Teleports and such, but I won't, because that would not be productive.  Here are my suggestions to make the ranger class more balanced and viable to play among the other classes in Everquest:<P>1)  Defense.  Rangers have had the same defense ability since level 39. Granted, no classes received the ability to progress past 200 in Defense until reaching level 51, but rangers should receive a slight increase in this skill.  If the changes on test are any indication, virtually all other melee classes (and even bards, who are not primarily a melee class in most circumstances - that is to say, they do not fill the requirement of a tank in most high level groups) are receiving the defense cap of warriors.  If this holds true, rangers should have their defense skill cap raised to 225 or 230 to bring them in line with (but still lower than) other melee classes.<P>2)  Defensive skills (parry, dodge, riposte)<BR>It has been stated many times by various VI spokespersons that rangers are designed to be the nimble, chain wearing warriors of the forest, and therefor not meant to be as durable as a warrior.  If rangers are meant to be more nimble and avoidant than warriors, I believe our defensive skills should reflect this and be HIGHER than warriors.  Defensive skills have a lesser impact on survival and durability than AC, but I think giving rangers skills superior to a warrior's would bring a closer balance to the class, and add some truth to how our class has been defined by the game designers.<P>3)  Spells.  Rangers use druidic magic and have several spells that do not continue their "line" after level 50.  One thing I would like to see to continue the ranger's use of druidic magic is one or two "pack" spells.  I'm not talking about new spells that only rangers get (e.g. Call of the Predator), but other spells like Pack Chloroplast.  Granted we get chloro at 55, we should get PC at 60.  In most cases, it will not be necessary, as a druid with Regrowth of the Grove may be available, but rangers should have the option to provide this backup role as it shows the natural progression of their magic line.<P>4)  Jolt.  This spell is and always has been a hack.  I've been following the troubled issue of ranger melee ever since starting my ranger over 18 months ago and it has been made abundantly clear that the code responsible for an individual's placement on the hate list is based on the frequency of hits and POTENTIAL damage that person is dealing rather than the actual damage they are doing to the NPC.  This is why low delay weapons, of which rangers get many, generate a much higher place on the hate list.  Rather than address this code problem, VI has instituted Jolt, which if successful, removes the ranger from the top of the hate list.  Unfortunately, it is resisted over 50% of the time, and when resisted, generates additional aggro.  I often use Jolt to pull, as it is a fast casting spell that is less affected by line of sight problems than arrows, and this is ludicrous.  In addition to this, Jolt must be recast multiple times during combat, because if a ranger is using weapons that put him on the top of the hatelist to begin with, he/she is just going to get there again after resuming combat.  There are really only 2 ways to fix this problem without rewriting major areas of the code which generate the hate list; make Jolt's effect greater and much less resistable, or remove it entirely and replace it with Evade.<P>5)  Buffs.  I would like to see some of the buffs available to the ranger post level 50.  Some of these I see already going in on Test, such as resist cold and skin like nature, and we will have to see if these actually go live.  Rangers get Feet Like Cat at a very early level and yet receive no upgrade to this spell.  Granted, druids don't get an upgrade either that I am aware of, but an upgrade to this spell (somewhere in line with Storm Strength in level) would seem to be appropriate to the ranger class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Kendrick (VI employee) said this on the safehouse discussing the nerf to evade, "Jolt has fizzles, Jolt has interupts (which restricts Jolt as much as Evade is restricted, in terms of getting hit or moving), Jolt costs mana, and Jolt has resists to contend with, for a flat 500 points of hate reduction. <P>Jolt also has a much much higher level restriction, whereas a Rogue can Evade whenever he gets Hide, either by class or racial perk.<P>During that 1.5 seconds of casting, a Ranger can't melee and he is much more vulnerable to interupts than a Rogue's instant effect Evade. If he needs to chain Jolt, he's backed out of combat for several rounds.<P>Evade has a 67% chance of sucess after 40th level. The level of the Evade target has no bearing, which is another major advantage for the Rogue..try sticking a Jolt on a level 75 NPC."<P>He describes exactly what is wrong with jolt and why it is, and always has been a stopgap solution at best. So Absor, please tell me how rangers who are almost always near or at the top of the hate list when performing their function on a raid are supposed to live? Your own dev team member admits jolt doesn't work on high level mobs, so we're left trying to tank uber mobs with ridiculously low hp and ac quite often. Unfortunately, we aren't long enough to try for long :/<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Damage Mitigaion vs. Damage Avoidance<P>Ok, as far as ranger defense is concerned, the problem does not lie in the defense skill, or the ability to get high AC.  It lies in the underlying code that calculates AC.  AC, as we've been told by VI, is made up of 2 numbers, mitigation and avoidance.  As it stands, rangers are high avoidance, low mitigation.  This worked well pre kunark and all was happy.<P>Then along came kunark and it messed everything up.  The mobs were designed around faster encounters, so hit harder and hit for a way higher percentage.  So not only were we getting hit for full (which was pretty normal pre kunark) by every mob, but we got hit more frequently too.  Here's a hypothetical example:<P>Pre kunark lvl 45 mob:<BR>Hit us 45% of the time for an average of 70<P>Kunark mob lvl 45:<BR>Hit's us for 55% for an average of 110<P><BR>Now I understand that other classes have to overcome this also.  But other classes aren't getting hit for full, and are getting hit about the same as us.  Now some want a defense increase, but I hate to tell them that it will do little to no good.  I don't notice it a bit the difference between 900ac and 1100ac.  I'm still getting hit for full, and getting hit for a pretty high percentage.<P>I think the answer lies in the code we don't see, and won't show up in numbers that we see.  I think what we need is to have our damage avoidance upped to compensate for the higher percentage that mobs are hitting for.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Fezzic, the Defense skill IS damage avoidance.  That's why it's in-character for Rangers, Rogues and Monks to get HIGHER Defense than other classes.
