</FONT><HR>Couple things.<P>Rallos - Saw a few comments (mostly from known PKs) that the no-drop tag should be dropped... NOPE.  One reason.<P>PK's will always have faster access to better equipment than those who chose to play by any sort of moral code.  PK's when they make a kill essentially have the equivelant of a uber-mob loot selection every time.  Taking off the no drop tag would shift the balance of power far too far over on the side of evil.<P>Regarding Enchanters<P>Dr_no   I agree the enchanter class is not about damage...but after Verant ripped out charm and fear (what the enchanter class IS about) we have nothing left.  We should get something to compensate for that loss.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>For Tallon/Vallon ZEK:<BR>Reposting from thread one page one FYI.<P>1) Address the issue of rogues / warriors / monks "deleveling" so that they have skills far in advance of their current level. Nothing worse than being PK'ed at level 6 by a person with a last name. <P>(2) 8 levels is too far a difference in levels. A caster can do nothing to a character more than 6 levels higher, yet can be attacked by them. Reduce to 4 levels, please.<P>(3) One team server should be left as is (4 teams). The other team server should be made light versus darks (either class and religion based OR all races vs iksar/darkelves/trolls/ogres). Allow a movelog for characters to choose whether they stay on the current 4 team set up or to the light vs dark server.<P>(4) Address cross team healing and so called OOR immortal healing. I don't have an opinion on this, but it seems that many people do. I can say that on a lighty raid of Nek woods the other day of low levels 12-20 we were very frustrated when the level 50 ogre shaman continually healed the darks we were fighting (with no oor healers of our own--even the darks were kind of mad at him).<P>(5) Not sure if SK harm touch resets on an exp death or not, haven't tried it yet (patch went in today). If it doesn't reset when killed by a MoB, this needs to be fixed. Suiciding to get it back is an issue, not exp dieing. <P>(6) Faction hits. Is there anyway to change the current system? An 'aggressor' flag of some kind would be great, so that only aggressors take a faction hit, and not the people who get attacked.<P><BR>7) I can't believe I forgot about Area Effect spells. I play a wizard. Enough said.My AoE spells can't be used in a group situation because if I group with anyone not on my elf team, it will destroy them too  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> People in your own group (ie your party) should not be hit by any offensive spell you cast. This is the only fix.<P><BR>(8) Fix the guards at the newbie areas. These guards are able to solo Lady Vox. This has ruined raids on cities. The reason it was done was to stop guard farming on the blue servers. Whole threads have been devoted on fixes.Make the guards level 10 and buffed to fight like level 25-30. This will keep the newbies safe, stop people from farming guards, AND allow us to raid enemy cities.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Disallowing Xteam buffs/heals(but allow rez) seems to be the popular favorite.<P>But I don't believe you NEED to Xteam to be successful in Everquest.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Let me preface this response with a little information about who I am.  My main character is Duhara, a level 60 barbarian shaman on Vallon Zek, who is one of the leaders of Defiant.  I have played on Vallon since the day it was brought up.  After reading through most of the posts on this thread I believe the following issues will best improve game play on Vallon without a lot of adverse effects.<P>Issue #1: Cross Teaming and Out of Range healing.  <BR>To solve this issue I would instigate a three-part solution: <BR>A) Limit all beneficial spells to the 8 level range that is attached to offensive spells. <BR>EFFECT: Drastically reduces the ability to OOR heal.   Yes there is still the case where a level 48 could kill a level 40 with healing from an OOR healer, however, given normal game mechanics this would happen anyway.  This solution would eliminate the ability of a level 10 character to wipe out a party of level 15 characters due to the presence of a level 50 druid chain healing and casting damage shields.<P>B) Apply the PvE method of attaching faction hits to the PvP environment.<BR>APPLICATION: Once PvP combat is engaged (i.e. a PC is damaged by another PC) anyone casting beneficial spells on the combatants is added to the faction list.  In addition all PCs who take part in offensive action should receive a faction hit not just the person who lands the killing blow.<BR>Effect: This would in effect make immortal healers think about immortal healing if they realize they will be made KOS in their home towns.  While not completely solving the problem at high levels (Most people don’t care about faction) it would reduce the problem.<P>C) Attach a “traitor flag” to combatants immortal healing <BR>APPLICATION: A flag is activated when a PC Buffs or heals a member of a different team that has been damaged by PvP.  When activated the flag will cause that PC to be vulnerable to attack by any race, and thus have their name color switched to some new “traitor” color.  As this could be detrimental to faction any kill of a PC flagged as a “traitor” would result in faction hits associated with the last person of another team they healed.<BR>EFFECT: Would wipe about the ability to immortal heal.  In essence anyone who heals a member of another team would be fair game to all, and have the faction hits associated with the PC they were healing/buffing.<P>Issue #2: Lack of a real “Death Penalty” in pvp<BR>PROBLEM: Being killed in pvp combat has no real consequences and is easily exploitable.<BR>EXAMPLES: Tanks bound inside the zone they are PvPing in can endless bindrush with no real consequences.  Casters bound close to the combat have no mana but with clarity II or a bard this only stops them for 3-4 minutes.<BR>SOLUTION:  Apply a 15-minute “death effect” to all PCs killed in PvP combat.  This effect would be substantially worse then traditional resurrection penalties.  In addition to standard resurrection penalties I would extend the time frame to 15 minutes, add a major combat speed defuff (Turgurs) and dramatically lower both intelligence and wisdom.  In effect this spell would keep the combatant from doing anything in PvP for 15 minutes.<P>Issue #3: Super Resist items<BR>PROBLEM: The current resist items available to most 50+ characters basically invalidate a vast majority of casting classes from having any offensive abilities in pvp against an opponent of the same level.  Enchanters, shaman, and clerics have essentially NO WAY to damage a prepared opponent with magic.  Each of these classes has no low resist damage spell, and no way to lower resists enough to make their spells hit.  Yes shaman have maloxxxx series but it will never stick, and enchanters have tash; but most enchanters will tell you that even with tash none of their spells will stick.  At lvl 60 shaman get malo, however, by level 60 most opponents can easily get their poison/disease resists over 130 and bane/pox/ebolt/plague will never stick on someone with 80+ poison/disease resists.  Blue diamond jewelry has essentially made these classes healers and buffers for PvP combat.  Druids, necros, mages, and wizards all have some spells that are either unresistable or have a very low resist rate.<BR>SOLUTION: Give each of these classes a low resist damage dealing spell for high mana costs or lower the resist rates on the level 50+ spells.  <P>Issue #4: Z-axis poofing.<BR>PROBLEM: This is an Everquest issue in general, but it adversely effects PvP. Simply, when a player is too much higher or lower than you (frequently as little as about 6 feet), they can simply vanish. The server stops sending you information about them, even if you have them targeted, even after the recent improvements to update rate. (Thanks to Slamz for this)<BR>SOLUTION: Fix the coding &#61514;<P><BR>Issue #5: Guides showing up on ShowEQ.<BR>PROBLEM: Not technically a PvP issue, but it's a griefer issue, and griefers like PvP servers. Simply, a guide entering a zone invisibly to scout for exploiters will show up on ShowEQ. The grief players know when to stop causing trains, etc, because of this. Fix this, catch the griefers, everyone is happy. (Thanks to Slamz for this)<BR>SOLUTION: When guides zone into a zone invisible do not transmit guide location to the client.<P><BR>Issue #6 Con system<BR>SOLUTION: Make anyone in range white those too high should be red those too low should be green.<P>Issue #7 Pumice<BR>THOUGHTS: Pumice should remain out of the game or make it self only with a 1-2 second cast time and only 1 charge per stone. Non stackable.  For any of the buffing classes pumice basically made our buffs worthless.  In the current form melees have to stand still for a short period of time to cast a spell, just like casters have to stand still to cast a spell.  Egg shaped pumice is completely unbalancing.<P>Issue #8: Unresistable Spells<BR>THOUGHTS: There seems to be a lot of people complaining about unresistable dots (Splurt, WD) ect.  Each of these spells can be dispelled if you are aware of them, so I see no problem with them.  IF you learn how to keep the top two buff spots open when you pvp splurt and winged death are just mana sinks for their casters.<P>Thanks for you time,<P>Duhara<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi Coan =P<P>I have to disagree with you on no drop items. MANY items are no drop because VI decided that ONLY people who were part of the encounter(epic) deserve to own such items.<P>IMO Verant dropped the ball on Trakanon drops by making them NOT no drop. From RISK/REWARD standpoint there is NO basis at all in removing NO DROP status from planar equipment. The risk that 2 to 3 or more groups took to gain that equipment is FAR FAR more then the risk ANYONE risks in ANY pvp. Planar armor is a REWARD for GREAT risk.<P>I dont pvp naked.. I dont even pvp in all no drop. In fact SOME no drop I DONT wear in favor of resist items that ARE droppable. *shrug*<P>There IS a discrepancy in RISK/REWARD for pvp however. How to fix it Im not sure.. but removing NO DROP status from items.. particularly PLANAR items is NOT in ANY way balanced at ALL.<P>Danil<BR>53 champ<BR>RZ</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I second that range problem.  It is not specifically a PvP problem.  During bad lag I see that "Target out of range." message until my view has me past the target, at which point I may hit it or see the "You can't hit them from here." message.<P>This occurs much more frequently in PvP.  I assume it is due to the communication between three processors(PvP), rather than two(PvE).<P>Very frustrating for melee's.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi Wayward<P>Agreed, enchanters need some compensation for their class defining spells being weak/nerfed for PvP. I just don't think it should be a poison/fire/ice/disesase based DD spell line. I don't know enough about it to comment further. But I agree that something should be done to improve their PvP skills. (I always get mezzed by chanters, which is annoying, but hardly a killer)<P>Further...to someone else:<P>And a defense I make:<BR>Weaklightykiller(probablegnome_001) says:<P>&gt;&gt;Please do NOT change TZ to GvE (or LvD). This is supposed to be a 4 teams server. It has been that way since I created my first character on TZ almost a year ago. I have seen some of the suggestions of some of the xteamers who wants to change this server to GvE (or light vs dark). I do not think it is fair for me (who has made has made friends and respected enemies on this server) to move to another server because people do not like to play Team vs Team. &lt;&lt;<P>Um...we don't want you to move to a different server. We want to leave you and go play on a GvE server.<P>Stay on your server Knightbane. Hey, we'll even let you and the 5% of you who want to have a hard coded 4 team server have one so you can do all the team vs team killing you want...<P>And with the other 95% of the lights who play on TZ and VZ, I'll be doing a /movelog and enjoying myself killing darks.<P>Your argument is non-existant. If you want to play with your friends and enemies who feel your way, you can stay on the server that remains 4 teams.<P>You only seem to want unsuspecting victims who are trying to roleplay a light vs dark server because VI stupidly hasn't given us one (YET).<P>I suspect if they make a movelog to a good vs evil server for TZ and VZ then they are going to have one server with 3 times the population of the other at all times. <P>Just a guess.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>As Taken From my Previous Post.... more at the bottom sperate<BR>First of all I'll comment on Item loot vs Coin loot. I dislike the idea of coin loot, not because I'm greedy for loot, but because no one cares about dying unless they lose something, whether that be experience, or gear. Yes, you argue they will lose money, but how many people actually care about money? And how often is the money you carry around enough to make you mad enough at the person to want revenge? Its completely useless to kill a person who comes back over and over again and doesn't care in the slightest if they die (*cough* Reefman *cough*) Who will suicide, and /q out to get the dmg bonus and cause exp to others. They have nothing to lose, and can be completely effective WITH FULL GEAR. It is bad enough with all the no drop floating around from planes. (Discussed in more detail down) Thats my opinion on coin loot, flame all you want, but thats how it is.<BR>Problems:<BR>1) Portal ganking: Guilds who participate in this sort of action are normally of the PK variety, however if an anti-pk guild sees pks port in, they will also take part in this time honored favorite exploit of RZers everywhere.<P>Solution: Give players a 5 second invulnurability period after zoning, or porting into a zone. Making it impossible for say 5 Draughts of Fire to hit before a person even comes into screen, sup Maule, Teef, Genaside, Kityara, Apak, and Wiqid.<P>2) No drop gear: For players with full no drop, they remain at 90% efficiency with absolutely no risk to themselves. Most of the 50+ population you will find, stay in complete no drop unless DEEP inside a dungeon. They will go around trying to kill people with full droppable PvP gear, while themselves wear nothing except no drop, even though the people they are fighting are much better resists, the outnumbered opponent will lose, if it be the person wearing full droppable gear, he losses an item, if it be the person wearing all no drop, he loses nothing but his coin, and comes back to loot his corpse, med, or in the case of melees, fight again. Absolutely nothing for them to lose when they die, and thus they pull out all the stops.<P>Solution: Make all gear on RZ servers, except for epics, droppable. Possibly leave Plane of Sky gear no-drop as well. Hate\Fear\Growth needs to be all switched to droppable. There is one other solution to this problem, which will be covered in the part about resistances vs the 66% dmg DDs.<P>3)AE spells on all PvP servers are useless because they effect players, regardless of if they are grouped with you or not. This makes AE spells COMPLETELY useless in all events, and dungeons, although they are effective for Quad kiting, and PvP. It would be nice to be able to use these spells for what they were meant for. <P>Solution: Make a PvP switch. /pvp on, /pvp off. /pvp on, will make spells work as normal on PvP servers, i.e. everyone NPC or PC gets hit. /pvp off will work like any blue server, all NPC get hit, no PC get hit. Whether /pvp switch is on or off, you will still be able to be hit by PC players with their /pvp on. I suggest this over the solution stated earlier in this thread because in large scale events in velious, kunark or planes, you never have just 1 group, or even just 2 groups. Thus you would still never use the AE spells in events. This solution however fixes the entire mess and makes area effects completely usable on the PvP servers. This also minamizes problems of people hitting their friends accidently at events because of lag and such.<P>okay balance stuff now<P>1) DD spells do 66% dmg of PvE in PvP. <BR>for example:<P>Ice comet does 1120 PvE dmg, for 400 mana with instant effect with a 6 second casting time.<P>It does 739 dmg PvP, for 400 mana, with instant effect after a 6 second casting time.<P>Remedy heals 438 HP with a 3 second casting time for 175 mana. <P>Do the math here folks, for every Ice comet a wizard casts, a cleric can completely heal himself + more, when Ice comet is not resisted at all.<BR>Lets check druid PvP ability<BR>Chloroplast, heals for 428 3 second casting time for 175 mana.<BR>Again same situation as with cleric heal, although this spell is 55, druids still have superior healing, which still will out heal Ice comet, or any other wizard spell in PvP. Not that they shouldn't be able to, but with this kind of healing power why should there be a 66% dmg nerf on DD spells in PvP? (I purposly used the most POWERFULL DD in the game when doing these calculations, because even when completely unresisted it is still very useless against any type of healing class) Shaman have similar healing spells. Paladins have LoH. Ranger have weak healing spells so I won't count them. This means 4/14 classes has the ability to OUTHEAL a wizards best DD spell in PVP, even when the spell is not resisted at all WHICH happens 1/30 times against any player with decent resists.<P>Solution: take off the 66% dmg reduction on DD spells for PvP. The reason that these classes have become so powerful for healing purposes is because of the new uber kunark mobs that call for more healing power. Wizards are completely out gunned, as are enchanters, and mages when it comes to this sort of healing power.<P>2)DoTs vs DD spells in PvP<BR>Once again <BR>Ice comet 729 dmg, in 6 seconds if unresisted <P>(which as stated before rarely is completely unresisted, where most cold resists are always buffed above 100, making Ice comet actually on average do about 100 dmg, my own cold resist is actually 167 with self buffs only, druids sometiems have over 200 in cold\fire as do shamans\clerics and various other classes that may be buffed by classes with the resist line of spells)<P>Now we get to complete unbalance<BR>Druid DoT winged death: 1287 dmg pvp (no nerf on DoTs) 5 second casting time. Do the math guys, thats 24 damage a second, for 54 seconds. This goes straight through skin spells. (i.e. mana skin\rune wont stop this badboy) Now can you guess what a druid's favorite tactic is to use with this spell? DoT and run... They winged death you, cast soc on themselves and run for the hills. you can chase after them, or die at your bind point, its your choice really. If they stay and fight, they still have that DoT on you, and their 54 DD 454 dmg in 2.5 seconds. (more dmg and faster then level 51 draught and less resistable in my experience) This total damage out put in PvP maxed for a druid in a given PvP encounter is HUGE!. FYI Winged death will kill any pure caster by itself if left alone, and is completely unresistable with a very long range. <P>Splurt is much the same story doing 1100 full dmg in PvP, this is death for almost any caster, not to mention the necro gets the life back.<P>Suggestion: Either a) make Winged death and splurt resistable or b) reduce dmg in PvP on these spells. And btw druids with WD and Chloroplast + their superior resistances and a DD spell that easily rivals wizard's for best DD IS CRAZY in PvP. Druids before this patch were nuts, with chloroplast they are going to be the undesputed GODS of PvP.<P>3) Melee resistances seem WAY too high. I heard something about extra resistances melee's recieve for PvP, but I'm not sure if this is true, or it just seems that way because they have more HP? 50+ it is crazy to have this kind of resist for melees, wizards can't even take down a melee using full lures. <BR>suggestion: remove the resist, if any from melee classes.<P>4)Resistances on 50+ spells don't seem to check right for classes under 1500 HP. I have my fire resist up to 210 (with resist fire) and scoraie still does 2 bubs of damage 9/10 times without mana skin. (me with 990 HP)which is about full damage. But when mana skin is up, (591 absorb) it seems to take 5 scoraie's on average to take it down with only a 164 FR. I have checked this multiple times with druid friends, in preperation for this post. Mana skin (591 abosorb) seems to eat 5 scoraie's on average before going down with 164 fire resist. On average that is 118 dmg per scoraie when Mana skin is up. However doing 10 scoraie's 9 out of 10 scoraie's hit for more then 118 dmg, 6 our of the 10 scoraie's hit for more then 200dmg, 5 hit for more then 300, and 4 hit for max damage with mana skin down. I then tried the experiment with Draught of fire. (458 pvp) This time it took 8 draughts of fire to take down mana skin, we then figured fluke, and tried it again to find that it took 7 draughts to take down mana skin. Then without mana skin draught seemed to be more susceptible to resists then scoraie, however it still hit for 300 dmg for average without mana skin, with only 1 hitting for full dmg. Could there be some sort of weird bug? I am consistantly seeing scoraie, and other DD take FOREVER to eat through my mana skin, but then take me down with 3 times the dmg without it. Please explain this. <P>Also then we tried buffing a warrior with 210 fire resist. We found 6/10 times Draught of fire would hit for 100-200 and 3/10 would hit for 200-300, and 1/10 would hit for 300-454max. Scoraie was used with similar results. Where as listed before draught of fire hits a wizard with 990 HP and 210 resistances for an average of 300. For reference the wizard used was 52, druid was 54, and warrior was 51.<P>solution: give all non-melee excluding rogue a HP buff when calculating saves, or take it out of the equation all together, if this isn't a bug, it should be fixed anyways. Please tell me how this is calculated so we can find why this happens.<P>4) necro dot drains<BR>BoD and spells like it, even when dispelled, continue to give the necros health<P>solution: if splurt is dispelled on a player, the necro stops receving health. This hurts a lot in PvP, when a necro just chain casts these type of spells and still gain health for each one.<P>5)melees cant hit casters running around casting for crap. Lag, hills, levitate are contributing factors to this problem.<P>Solution: Give melees a bind target where they will follow that target around easier. Also slightly increase melee range in PvP.<P>6)Enchanters can't mez hardly anyone anymore because of the High MR used at 50+ levels, even with tashani on the player mez will still only hold 5/10 times. Similar problem with root.<P>solution: make all magic based spells slightly less resistable. Stuns\mez\root\magic all or nothing DD just do NOT work ever.<P>Well I think i covered it all. If i left out anything feel free to e-mail me at Sysop182@hotmail.com<BR>or go post at the begotten public board www.thebegotten.com<P>So far I think this has been the first post to really cover all the unbalances specifically on the pvp servers. <P>As you may have noticed I used a wizard to compare to most of the other classes in the DD section, not because I feel wizards are the weakest of any class in PvP. But because they have the most mana efficienty DD spells, and I was showing how much the 66% dmg cap in PvP has thrown the favor to the other direction 50+, on the other hand in pre-50 levels things should be left as they are, but post-50 things are COMPLETELY messed up.<P>Please read, comment, and please do not flame my opinion as I have not flamed yours.<P><BR>____________________________________________________________________________________________________<P>2nd addition<P>Summing up the Problem with Resistances:<BR>Casters with high resistances are seeing a very little increase in their resist rates over casters who have relatively low resistances.<P>Example: <BR>A wizard with very high fire resist (200 FR) caught in a draught of fire war with a wizard with low fire resist (100 FR). The wizard with the 200 FR will win approximately 70% of the time. (the data taken from draught wars with pks) <P>the Wizard with 200 FR should be winning 99% of the fights. (I used extremes just to give an example)<P>That was just a straight draught war, chain casting draught of fire.<P>In contrast Warrior's get dealt BY FAR much less damage when draught of fired with high resistances. (i.e. their resist rate is much higher)<P>If a wizard continuosly draught of fires a warrior with 200FR, his draught will do MUCH less on average. I'm talking like 100 dmg a draught here max.<P>Either 1 of 2 things or both is the cause<BR>1) Melees have extra resist buffs in PvP<BR>2) HP is a determaining factor in calculations for saves<P>What are the changes I suggest for this? Make is so people with low resists are effected more by DD spells I.E. anything under 80 and DD spells should do 100% dmg 9/10 (50+)<P>66% dmg cap on PvP spells need to be removed, it was a fix that should have never happend, the resistance system was at fault the entire time, but just was never changed.<P>AGAIN PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE look at the way saves are calculated, and figure out why at low HP resistances have such little effect compared to high HP.<P>To CidHighwind: You are delusional. You make completely baseless flames on subjects you have no clue about. I speak about numbers, and a system that more then likely has a bug in it that was never accounted for, possibly causing many of the problems that have come to fruitation. You speak of me being an uber-pk, which, has absolutely nothing to do with my post. You continuosly spout off your old and used slogans about the "evil pks" ganking all your gear unfairly all the time, never in a fair manner, but unfortunatly the root of the problem is that you are so angry about losing an item you force yourself to beleive you were cheated, when, in reality it was a completely fair kill and you were bested. If you can't deal with that, you like the rest of your comrades who whine about this sort of action, belong on a different server, and I hope the GMs give you the option because GOD AM I SICK OF YOUR WHINING.(yes if there was any doubt you have been stereotyped by your slogans and i doubt its wrong either)<BR>Now that I am done berating you for flaming me, I'll address your so-called "uber-pk" issue, just so the GMs don't get confused about what the real issues are. <BR>If you are refering to the guild in which I am a recruit, Begotten, as being an uber-pk guild, then I'm afraid you are mistaken. We are a PvP guild that wars other guilds that cross us, or give us some other reason to. When we war a guild, that guild becomes KoS, or Kill on sight for non-natives. Yes Cid, we may seem like Pks to you, because if you are in one of the guilds that has given us reason to KoS them, we will kill you as well, we may come with superior numbers, we may not. If you don't wish to fight for your guild, simply target yourself and type /guildremove and our guild will no longer kill you, unless you are an individual KoS.<BR>On to *real* pk guilds. PK guilds like Darkenbane, may be considered some what of a problem in mid-levels, but 50+ I assure you, Absor, they are no problem except when you port in at a portal with 6 of them already sitting there and you get hit by 6 spells before you even come up to screen. See my portion on zone\portal camping. Cid you belong on a blue server, please go there now. Go camp stuff there, this server is about war, and we won't stop war for you to camp items.<P>Unerfed pumice is too crazy, WAY TOO crazy to be allowed back in its former state. A possible nerf of this would be to allow it for self target only, which would help stop WD\Splurt and run syndrome, and help the melees get out of rooted situations. <BR>50+ would just be NUTS with old pumice. (although id love to have some for myself )<BR>Also if damaging spells were removed first from buff list when pumicing this would help get rid of problems with these spells, and other over powered de-buffs.<P>I'd agree with GMs who knew what they were doing, get them on our server please  Btw Ozuri is a good GM promote him to server GM please. Make a set of PvP rules and make sure all GMs stick to them, no more of this icky picky crap for each GM.<P>I think Out of ranged healers might need looking at. Possible solution would be that if a out of range healer is healing a target of PvP action, that target is immediatly attackable by all people in range to the person he is healing. <BR>For Example:<BR>(this sort of thing would only be balanced at the 50+ level)<BR>A level 50 cleric is healing a level 60 tank, since the cleric chooses to do this, he is now in range of all of the people attacking this 60 tank. Reverse the situation and you have a 60 cleric healing a 50 tank, now all people attacking the 60 cleric may CHOOSE to attack the 60 cleric, to which the cleric can then start casting offensive spells on the people attacking the tank. Currently the OOR healer issue pretty much sucks when you are trying to PvP people. Of course this balance would only work for the 50+ world since a level 50 class stands a chance to take down a level 60 of any class.<P>Once again PLZ PLZ PLZ PLZ LOOK AT SAVES AND HOW IT COULD BE SCREWING UP!<BR>resistances still just dont seem to check right for low HP players.<P>Arkons<BR>p.s. thanks for reading this novel, I know its trying Absor, but there is a lot of problems to go through and I seem to be the only one giving actual problems rather then the typical "get rid of pks they steal my gear and therefore I must change the world" line. sup cid?'<P>__________________________________________________<P>Third addition<P>To the people who make unsubstatiated claims against my posts:<BR>Wayward: No one is laughing at my posts, your the only person who has.  It isn't just wizards who can't defend against it conventually, its every class.  Wayward if you don't see the reason Druids are too powerful in PvP remove yourself from this board and go play on a blue server because you are a complete moron. I never suggested a nerf for every class.  I suggested a nerf for the two most over powered classes, druids and necros, and all DD casting classes the increase from 66%dmg to 100% was to offset the total revamping of resists to make it more fair and make DD casting classes much less effective against people who wear resists... again READ THE POST FULLY BEFORE COMMENTING !.  If you missed the point completely here it is summed up for you: Druids have a unresistable that kills a caster in less then a minute, which eats through all rune buffs.  Druids have the ability to heal as well as a cleric(see chloroplast).  Druids have a DD that has been determained to be MUCH more powerful then any wizard spell of similar standards, in PvP (Scoraie), once again Scoraie does 454 PvP in 2.5 seconds, draught is 458 in 3 seconds, and draught is much more resisted, lures wouldnt be comparable because they are less damage and more casting time, dont even try to pull that position.  Fact is, and it seems most of this thread population agrees with me, that druids need to be nerfed, mostly because of their DoT, and so do Necros.  <P>Now we come to what I actually suggested we do about the situation, which was to make harmful effects be removed first when dispell is casted on a player.  This would also eliminate effect anti-mez tactics.  IT is not my favorite solution as I would like to see DoTs become balanced resistance wise, as I would like to see DDs balanced resistance wise. <BR> <BR>Wayward to explain what i speak of when i say resistances, I don't want there to be damage nerfs, dmg nerfs makes <BR>1) healing 34% more powerful <BR>2) naked gankers too powerful.  <P>But Arkons, how can this be so?  <P>Under my system of change, the effect of resistances would be INCREASED, and the damage caps REMOVED.  <P>How would that change things Arkons?  <P>It would change it so someone with 150 fire resist would be DRASTICALLY harder to kill with fire spells, then a naked ganker with say 60 fire resist.  I.E. The naked ganker would die in 2 draughts of fire, as opposed to the 150 FR wizard taking 7 or more draughts to kill (both 51 wizards).  <P>Does this make wizards more powerful then they currently are Arkons?  <P>Well, It makes them more powerful when dealing with people who wear all no drop and walk around naked, but it makes them LESS powerful as resistances get higher. In other words your favorite resident No drop planes wearing PvP wuss, would be dead before his feet hit the floor, as opposed to him having only a slight disadvantage in the current system.  <P>Arkons would this make any other classes more powerful?  <P>yes this would make other classes MORE powerful in the same way it makes wizards more powerful, (i.e. there will be more of a advatage to high resistances), but it would make other classes with DD spells LESS powerful under situations where signifigant resists were involved.  <P>Arkons would this fix the melee vs caster imbalance as well?  <P>Possibly, it depends how the save calculation is done.  My current theory is that HP is involved, which means the MORE HP you have, the BETTER chance you have to resist a given spell.  Meaning the lower life you have the MORE damage a spell does to you on average.  Thus making low level ganking easier, and making caster's resistances much more useless then a warrior with 2500 hp.  <P>I want to reverse this possibly on a % basis.  Meaning that if you have 1 bubble of life left, (20% of your life) your resist save due to your percentage of life would be GREATER then then when you had higher life making it that much more difficult to be killed at low life when zoning from a train ect.  <BR>Now if the situation were completely reversed now, casters would have their resistances save for much more, and warrior's would have their resistances save for much less.  But I don't want this to happen, thus i propose it be based on percetage of life.  <P>100% HP = the current save rate of warriors of the same resistances, for all classes<BR>75% HP = slightly higher save rate <BR>50% HP = Higher save rate<BR>25% HP = VERY HIGH save rate (making it hard for lucky ganks)<P>Wayward I hope that explains to you what I actually want changed, and how it should be changed.  If you still think its because I want wizards to be uber-powerful, you're an idiot.<P>CidHighwind, I have no clue who you are, I highly doubt you sent me running away (lol).  And if you did I ran because it was uneven odds, not because of your superior PvP skills.  As for the rest of your post, you show your ignorance once again.<P>&gt;Arkons wants the aggressors(murderers) to have &gt;even more of an advantage than they already &gt;have. It is that simple, and I think the &gt;opposite needs to happen, that a small bit of &gt;their advantage needs to be shifted away from &gt;them. <P>Id be interested where I said this.  In fact my entire plan of action, detailed above is based on decreasing the power of being an aggressor and evening up the sides, so when you get jumped by 3 PKs, and you got 3 melees with you, you are gonna be able to put up a hell of a fight.  Im not interested in ganking people Cid, I want to INCREASE the quality of PvP on the server.  How? <BR>Read above, won't that help things on the server immensly?  It isn't going to make casters more powerful, its going to make them LESS offensive, and MORE defensive.  (i.e. buffing up everyone's resist rates makes all casters less effective offensivly then in the current system, and MORE effective defensivly, which they lack in the current system)  Please read all my posts over thouroughly and you, Cid, will find that I am right, just like all the other people who have posted their support have.  I have the research, you have none, you just speak of petty in game politics.  keep this thread to people who have done their homework Cid and just post your unwavering support or suggestions for additions, dont go flaming people based on the research they have done and their very educated suggestions concerning such.<P>To T-Wax:<P>&gt;Arkons, you only want to be able to kill people &gt;in one nuke and have others not be able to touch &gt;you. If the pvp damage reducer is lifted for &gt;dd's ANY wizard with ICE COMET can kill a caster &gt;(and most druids) in ONE cast. How does that &gt;balance things? It doesnt. It makes the already &gt;powerful pvp class of Wizards that much more &gt;deadly. I personally would quit pvp if they did &gt;that. Thats 3 accounts Verant would lose. And &gt;YES ONE OF MY MAINS IS A 51 WIZARD! <P>You all jump at me about lifting the dmg cap, when in reality when both steps are taken anyone who wears decent resists 50+ is going to be more able to survive attacks, especially out numbered one.  I am increasing people's survival here, not making it easy for a wizard to 1 shot someone.  Read the entire post then comment.  Wizards aren't very powerful currently because their DDs do such little damage, the reason they seem so powerful is because large groups of pure wizards can take down someone very quickly.<P>&gt;You talk about druid heals being too powerful. I &gt;say BS. Use your tools. You have a spellbook &gt;FULL of interrupt spells and stun spells. Learn &gt;some tactics other than nuke nuke nuke nuke &gt;nuke. Try your stuns. You even have cold and &gt;fire based interrupts. <P>The current druid healing spell is the one im concerned about T.  Chloroplast heals 428 HP in 3 seconds.  Thats more healing power then Ice comet has dmg power.  3 second casting time, stun spells dont work because of resist problems with those spells, shock of lightning is very often casted through 50+.  If you know of cold and fire based interupts please inform me about them because I have never heard of such things.  But im fairly certain they dont exsist.<P>&gt;I dumb wizard is a dead wizard, but a smart &gt;wizard is the king of pvp. Look at Darkenbanes &gt;web site. Look at the screenshots. See the &gt;trend. The majority of the kills come FROM &gt;wizards. And Ice Comets in particular. Sure, &gt;most have a druid with them, but you see the &gt;druid casting starfire, or calefaction, etc. NOT &gt;their dots. WHy? because the fights last all of &gt;10 seconds. It would be a waste of mana to use a &gt;dot when a wizard opens up with Ice Comet. Their &gt;tactic seems to be to stick a wizard and druid &gt;together and the druid tracks down a target and &gt;the wizard nukes it. Druid just helps out a &gt;little. <P>Just because a group of 4 wizards can take down 1 person in 4 seconds doesn't mean wizards are too powerful PvP.  It means they are more effective at killing when they outnumber someone 4 to 1.<P>&gt;Wizards are awesome in pvp. Sure, High resist &gt;warriors may be better at times, but not always. &gt;And it would be too far in the opposite balance &gt;to lower their resists because a rooted melee is &gt;a dead melee. They cant defend against that. &gt;Especially without Egg Shaped Pumice.<P>Even a warrior with 50 MR will be tough to root.  And a high resist warrior is unkillable unless DoTs are involved.<P><BR>Okay now to throw my support around.<P>1) I think there needs to be a loot and scoot rule of some sort imposed, whether it be through adding additional penalties for dying in PvP (i vote yes) or created a set rule about looting and leaving the zone to be strictly enforced by GMs. (I favor the previous)<P>2)Con system needs to be:<BR>Green = low and out of range <BR>Blue = lower then you but in range <BR>white = same level as you<BR>yellow = higher then you but in range<BR>red = higher then you and out of range<P>3) Guild affiliations should remain visable at all times (i.e. always tagged) I think this requires discussion<P>4) Stop the flames please.<P>5) HT needs to be increased back up to 100% but have its resistance be checked BIG TIME.

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>As I stated when the first thread came up, there are really two different sets of rules, with differing problems.  You might want to break future pvp threads into teams and rz parts.<P>Also, one of the clearest and most resounding things I have read in all 15 pages so far that is general is the following:<P>"Don't go test things on people from a blue server, on a blue server, and then implement them on the red servers."<P>Quite seriously, some of the worst things that have happened in the PvP game have occurred because they were tested by either<P>a.  too small a group of red players<BR>b.  blue players<BR>c.  players of the wrong level and class<P>For example, you will see how almost all of the spell casters talk about how pumice was overpowered and should have been removed.  Of course, they have the spells.  Almost all the pure melee's say the opposite, that the removal of pumice has been signing their death warrant in PvP.<P>If you want to do this right, poll a good cross section of the appropriate server.  Ask for it in Email.  You have all the email addresses for people posting on this thread, and I am certain they would be quite vocal addressing the finer points that you, not having grown up on a red server, may not know about.<P>Abashi, for all of his red background, played what is arguably the easiest, most powerful class in PvP, a necromancer.  Consequently, his view on PvP is quite distorted from the median.  If he had played a Paladin, for example, his view probably would be quite difficult.  Only by getting a good view of all of those different views in PvP will you be able to process and prioritize the problems of PvP in EQ.<P>I still maintain that the majority of the problems in PvP should simply be accepted, and the exploitation issue (which is really the core of a lot of complaints) be dealt with by saturating the server with guides/gms.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Please do not move the PK Level gap, Leave it at 8 levels, its hard enough to find someone to pk in the first place. Just find another way to make it so casters can't use spells 2 cycles higher on someone. I suggested a way earlier in a post on the first thread.<P>Make it so the caster can only cast a spell that is within 4 lvl's or lower of the player your attacking.  So a lvl 29 caster can cast on a lvl 21 but can only cast lvl 24 and lower spells on that person.  That would totally fix the problem and would keep the nice gap that there is.<P>I totally agree on making it so that pvp doesn't actually start till like lvl 5, so people can get use to playing on the server before getting owned every 5 seconds by some n00b camper.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If you want a change then make a new sever and alowe those that want that play style to switch to it.  The best way to fix the PvP problem with Invulnerable healing would be to hard code a server but for the number of people that would like to see that, don't hard code a server that is not allready.  You should have known that Invulnerable healing was going to be there in eather one form or another.  Make a new server, Hard Code it and alowe people from the 2 Team PvP servers to switch to it.  As far as any other problems with PvP, this game was not made very well for PvP.  With all the changes people want in the game you would have to make a hole new game to keep people happy.  You must know that PvP is hard in this game but the game was made for a grouping play style and there for your PvP should also be a grouping style.  I say leave the servers alone and stop changing stuff all the time and if need be start another server that is hard coded for the people that really want it but I am willing to bet that it will be a small server.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I say don't change the gap because i have logged onto my druid(lvl40) and gone looking to pk for hours and couldn't find a single person within my range first most because most players that play on pvp only lvl to like 20 and stop because all they want is to pk. Personally i like to get a good group and go spank some high lvl player thats killing everyone, makes it more fun, but if you change the gap then its just more of a luck thing, *who gets the first cast* or *who sneaks up on who first*  it would suck, And what if your trying to raid a zone. You would have to have WAY more people within different lvl ranges.  <P>The main problem is casters being able to own people 8 lvl's lower than them. With my idea it gives the lowbie a chance to actually kill that high person and fell good and talk some trash afterwards.... Theres nothing better than going into a zone, spankin the pants off of some high lvl trash talker and then gettin up in his face and askin what happened???<BR>The idea i gave just makes it a lil easier to do that.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

As it is now buffs in pvp are still useless.  Its dare I say "unbalancing."<P>     This also would make Enchanters more valuable in PvP because of their superior buff-stripping/dispelling abilities.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok here's my 2cp, i've been playing on Vallon Zek since day one, have a level 58 magician with 140+days played, and have lived from the many changes that happened on VZ.<P>1) X-teaming ruins the fun of PvP Teams, not speaking about immortal healing. It should be fixed, GvE seems to be the most prefered "fix" to this, but it won't adress the issues some hardcore teamers have (i'm thinking about the emergance of pure human and elven teams on VZ). The challenge of PvP teams is to do uber mobs with less than normal servers. If people want to play the way EQ is played on blue servers, then they shouldn't be there on the first place. Give a chance to people to /movelog to move to a blue server, then hardcode pvp teams, or GvE teams. If you do this, x-teamers will no longer have the excuse to say "but we're stuck here" yadda yadda when all they're looking for is an unfair advantage in PvP situations (immortal buffing, immortal scouting, multiquesting to raise faction in ennemy towns to be able to gank people at bank, etc ...)<P>2) : if you don't do 1), then please code faction for PvP situations just like it is in PvE environment. If a player heals someone who's fighting a player of the same race of the healer, the healer should take faction hit. This won't solve the problem for Dark Elves (getting faction for Neriak merchants/guards/banker is a joke, but hopefully the player will end up getting KoS in his own guild).<P>X-teaming is my main concern, it has plagued the Team servers for too long, i don't even want to start thinking about class balance in PvP before this is taken care of.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I play on Vallon Zek and am an officer of Emerald Defenders.<P>There have been plenty of posts about game mechanics and such.  I am going to spend my time commenting on the "teams" situation.<P>Emerald Defenders is a guild that excepts all light races and all classes except Necro and ShadowKnight.  We are a very active guild in our server community, and we are part of a multi-guild alliance that helps promote fair play and good sportsmanship when pvping.  That said, I feel that moving to a hard coded enforcement of the 4 teams is not something that would be good for our server as a whole.<P>The server has built its entire community around the system that is in place (albeit against the developers original intent).  To tear apart the majority of the guilds/groups of friends in order to help remedy several other problems would not be beneficial to the server as a whole.  It is very easy for someone who has a lvl 30 PK character to sit in judgement of large groups of 45+ players with significant time investments in both character and guild development.  This person would not be losing all of the hard work that went into building what we have today.  From my perspective, making such a drastic change to the way that a majority of the people on the server play the game would be wrong.<P>Wish I had time to elaborate, but there is a blizzard happening here and I need to get home  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Sheldon Finkletoe<BR>Shortee<BR>Druid<BR>Vallon Zek<BR>Officer<BR>Emerald Defenders</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Most of what I feel would help PvP has already been stated. I just wish to include that I feel the same about these things.<P>1. PvP teams should be TEAMS! Only way the other teams should be able to affect eachother is negatively, no grouping, buffing, healing, guilding, etc.<P>2. PvP teams level limit should be 6 levels max. Most classes can take out at least 2 people 8 levels below them. New spells occur every 5 levels or so sub 50, and these allow the person to have such an advantage. They will always have the spells over you.<P>3. PvP (Rallos) should be made so that damage spells do not affect the group that the person is in.<P>4.

</FONT><HR>Woot 491 posts to the origanl thread =P<P>Hope ya read em all Absor =)<BR>Since your just "reading" and all.... to take in ideas, make money off your own mistakes which over the years we have nailed to an art of what is wrong. Sad thing is that others have learned too, and not from 491 message posts, from really playing PVP and making a better system from day one. I honestly don't know if any of your GM's or guides understands the Zeks, or else you could ask them that question and get these same responses =) But I have a feeling they are as clueless as you appear to be. Good luck to you, and please read others threads, there are some great stuff here. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Arkons I cant believe you have a wizard except ive seen you in game.<P>You want cold based interrupt....<BR>Shock of Ice<P>fire based....<BR>Shock of Fire<P>They are the same line as the often used Shock of Lightning and DO interrupt from what I have seen.<P><BR>The damage output does not need to be increased. Even with CR over 120 I have lost 4 bubbles from ONE Ice Comet. That is a joke. If it werent for the 33% reduction that IC would have killed me. And I never even saw a soandso is casting message. That is not balanced OR fair. <P>The thing you dont realize is Verant is not going to try to balance the classes in PvP. They are going to look at the rules ONLY. My guess is that NOTHING will get changed other than maybe going coin only. <P>I wouldnt care if they did that. I joined the pvp server because the ability to solve a problem with another player is there. I don't care if I get to take an item from them. They worked hard for it. But I just like to be able to play the game and when I have a problem with someone I can rough em up if I choose. <P>I didnt start characters on this server so I could take loot from other players and I certainly don't like losing an item it took me 20 or 30 hours to get. That is just not fun. I would enjoy having Darkenbane attack me by surprise if I werent so concerned about losing my stuff. I would be more likely to fight back instead of gating, running, or bagging. I think it would improve pvp by a factor of 100. So your cash flow would slow down if you were a pker, but so what. The game would be more FUN if people didnt have to worry about losing time invested. PvP battles would be a lot more interesting, instead of seeing the  /ooc why did you run little girl?! comments in every zone. I get tired of seeing that stuff. If people just had to worry about fighting, instead of bagging. You wouldnt see as much of that. It would make pvp more interesting and challenging for the pkers. <P>This thread shouldnt be about who is and who isnt effective. This is a group game anyway remember. This thread should ONLY be about how to make the pvp game more enjoyable.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My opinion make all class specific quest items i.e. guild quests and Solusek Ro quests nodrop. If the ganker can't take it you can fight back with a better chance to survive.<P>And Arkons your argument about damage spells done from Necros/Shaman/Druids lowering effectiveness in spells will not work if you want to raise wizard damage spells. Lower damage from Dot's by the same percentage makes sense to me.<P>No drop keeps pvp alive and breaks ganking which in my opinion is a good thing.<P>And to the pk that says their guild will leave RZ if it goes coin only. I know many that won't miss your 'Darkenbane', or &lt;any of the jerk wanna ruin your day guilds here&gt; either.<P>Make all resists count in the same proportion. Make classes with single type resist spells like enchanters for instance have greater chance to land a magic DD since they have a greater affinity for magical dd.<P>For wizards since they get magic/fire/ice give them a higher resist factor for all three since they have more options than say a cleric or an enchanter only in pvp please.<P>I like the idea of changing one of the team servers to Light vs Dark race seems realistic to me from a roleplaying standpoint.<P>If no changes to the basic elements besides say "coin-only" on rallos give the option to move to another environment maybe a new coin only Rallos or to Blue so we can finish out our time here in peace before the mass exodus. Since Verant has been changing the enviroment several times you can't say we knew what we were getting into.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Boy, you sure do know how to open Pandora's box.<P>First off, I will stated that there will be 20 million different ideas on how the PvP servers should be set up, each from our own view.  Just try to keep that in mind, and do what is best based on the opinions that have been posted.<P>So, now for my turn:<P>1&gt; My biggest issue is for Verant to realize that what may bring about class balance on a non-PvP server does not necessarily bring about class balance on a PvP server.  One thing which was corrected was the SK Harm Touch being reduced, but there are so many other things that can be named.  I play a Warrior and a Rogue, as Casters aren't really my type.  I can tell you that being a non-casting class really puts me at a disadvantage against alot of the casting type classes.  When I go up against a Necro, and fight a pet that is almost as good as I am, and having a Necro with unresistable spells casting them on me, all you really have is one dead warrior.  Yes, I know that Verant's vision is to promote grouping, but there are those of us that do solo mainly because of how PvP works.  I am not saying that meleers should be uber-classes, but what I am saying is give straight meleers a fighting chance, instead of having a winged death cast on you, or splurt, or any other number of spells that are highly unresistable, and knowing you will die from it.<P>2&gt;Invulnerable healing.  I think this has to be the next biggest things.  On Rallos, you don't have to worry about it, but on TZ/VZ, we do.  I am an Iksar, and if I attack an elf, and a dark team cleric comes by to heal the elf, what is the point of me trying to kill the elf then?  I cannot switch over to attack the healer.<P>3&gt; How to alieviate it?  Well, either hardcode TZ as 4-teams, GvsE based on deity (what I would prefer), or Guild-based.  But any way you do it, make sure that you can not benificially help a member of the other team WITH the exception of Rez/Port/summon corpse (I mean, after all, we still wish to have some way to be nice to others and help them out in a bind).<P>4&gt; Bring back Pumice like it use to be.  But make it instant, 5 charges, cancel magic, SELF ONLY.<P>5&gt; This is more for EQ as a whole: Put in some items with teleport effects.  IE, put in rings with effects to TP you to basic ports, such as WC,Karana,IceClad,Dreadlands,Butcherblock. Make these items ALL/ALL, LORE/NO DROP, and put a minimum level limit on them for use at 35 or 40.  Also, make an item for binding as well, so that us non-binders don't have to spend 2 hours out of our 4 hours a night logged in shouting out for a bind.  Again, make it ALL/ALL, LORE/NO DROP.<P>Well, that is all I have for the moment.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alan, Absor, et al:<P>Please do not do anything to compromise the ability of the different light teams to buff/heal each other. The complaints about same-team healers come mostly from a small (but loud) minority who had no complaints about invulnerable healers when they themselves used out-of-range healers, a far more unbalancing exploit.<P>On Tallon Zek, the whole xteam healing furor only arose when the dark team, previously completely dominant, began to lose that dominance to a united light alliance. Many "dark" character players began an attempt to destroy the light unity by rolling light team twinks who created ligh-on-light PK guilds. When the light alliance proved impervious to these tactics, they began to agitate for code changes to cripple the ability of multi-race light guilds to fight together in PvP. When my guild offered a guildwar to these 4-team guilds, which would remove the invul healer exploit, we were invariably turned down. In other words, it wasn't exploiting that bothered these guilds, it was light teams allied together.<P>It is hardly a coincidence (which Verant can probably verify) that the 4-team guilds on TZ are primarily founded by (and disproportionately made up of) 2nd characters of dark team players.<P>Certainly some people do enjoy 4-team PvP for its own sake. But they are still a minority, and the server should not be hijacked by their demands because they are willing to complain more than the majority.<P>4-team makes no sense from a role-playing point of view, and flies in the face of the background story and atmosphere Verant has created, in which the light races tend mostly to be allies. Many light team quests require good faction with other light team NPCs, which would severely weaken them should 4-team PvP ruin that faction. The distribution of abilities and levelling areas is grossly unequal - the elf-team would be virtually unplayable in 4-team PvP, and elven characters would very likely all but vanish from the server.<P>If you need to fix invul healing, start with OOR healing and buffing, a far more serious problem. As far as xteam healers are concerned, either code the server as good-vs-evil, or change the code to remove the invulnerability, not the healing. In other words, if a member of team A heals a player from team B, the healer becomes vulnerable to other team A members for some short peiod of time after the heal (say 60 secs).<P>An alternative would be to base the PvP on guild rather than teams, where each guild can choose to ally itself with one of 2 super-factions.<P>But please don't destroy the fabric out of which the existing TZ commmunities and friendships are woven.<P>Thanks,<BR>Astrael</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
