</FONT><HR>Well, just to add to what has already been mentioned here.<P>* The rogue class is pretty well balanced as it is, we are mostly talking about polishing as someone else mentioned.<P>* The assertion that if you evade a mob will run across the zone to find someone else is false, that does NOT happen.<P>* Tracking skill should be added to rogues, it fits with our IC personae and it can cap at a lower skill if need be. Why a bard can track but a rogue cannot, makes no sense. <P>* Hide/Sneak across zone lines. Been enough said on this.<P>* Increase the movement rate over the course of 1-50 on sneak/hide. No reason i need to crawl like a baby while sneaking if my skill is in the 100s.<P>* See invis should not defeat hide/sneak as was mentioned earlier<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think pretty much everyone has said in one post or another what I think should be done for the rogues.  But I live to reiterate so here goes again  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Hide/Sneak<BR>- persist across zones, ld, campout<BR>- fix evade during combat so that if you are hit when you evade, you don't get a 'must be stationary to hide' message<P>Faster sneaking speed<BR>- we should get this at a lower level, or have a skill/level based increase so that sneak speed increases as you level<P>Poisons:<BR>- reduces the overall amount of time it takes to use this skill.  I don't care how you do it, but the skill as it is pretty much is useless right now.  there is downtime for every step of the poison creation process, from gathering components, making the poison to applying the poison.  And you wonder why people don't even bother using it?  possible fixes can include easier component gathering, stackable poisons (so you don't end up carrying the ingredients instead of the made poisons), reduced application time<BR>- make poisons applied persist across zone, LD and camp out.  It can be frustrating to lose your poison effect (12pp+ worth too!) on a day when the server keeps kicking you off, or your group decides they want to hunt somewhere else etc.<BR>- allow other classes to apply poisons (so you can sell them to recoup costs)<P>Tracking:<BR>- an 'assassin' that cannot track its intended target is ridiculous, while a singing minstrel can???<P>And yes, pretty much every class has a mean of escape in bad situations, be it gating, porting, FD, run away at lightning fast speeds, or have enough HP to last through running to the zone, rogues however is the only class that, if alone, will most likely die as a result.  It'd be nice if this issue can be addressed somehow.  And no, evading doesn't work if you are all by yourself  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Thanks for listening...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Suggested changes:<P>Evade - There is a problem that when mobs hit you while you are evading, you get the message "You must stand perfectly still to hide!"  Since evade/hide are tied to the same button, it makes sense that you can't hide while moving.  However, it does not make sense that you can't evade while getting hit [not to mention that the message is completely awkward].  This is especially harmful during extremely laggy periods when mobs hit you and you evade at what seems like a time that the mob didn't hit you, but it actually did [server lag combined with player lag].  This leads to death.  And I would like to call this a bug that could/should be looked into.  Failing to evade is perfectly acceptable.  However, failing to evade because "You must stand perfectly still to hide!" is probably a bug.<P>Poison - Having non-stackable poisons with one charge, an application time, and only one application per usage is very unproductive.  The only use I could find for poisons is when I need a mega taunt for a certain mob [such as when engaging  mob that must be riposted and therefore has to be on me for a certain duration].  I suggest making poisons either non-stackable or have multiple charges. Or let us apply two or more doses at a time.  <P>Sense trap/Disarm trap - During my time in Necropolis [disarming nasty beetle/dd traps], I've noticed that sense trap has a HORRIBLE radius.  I would walk down a NARROW hallway, sensing traps every 3-4 steps.  The recycle time on sense trap takes FOREVER, so I try to take as few steps as possible.  When I think it's safe, I call my group members down.  However, more often or not, they step on a trap!  That's ridiculous. I don't see how that's possible since this is a NARROW hallway and I'm walking down the CENTER every FOUR steps and sensing everytime it pops up.  I suggest a larger sense trap radius and a faster recycle time for the sense trap button to refresh.<P>Pick Lock - This is one of the worse skills to max, and one of the most necessary to max.  Some doors require 210 skill.  However, just getting to 201 skill takes HOURS of opening/closing door. I've heard of rogues going on 10 hours of opening/closing doors and getting ONE skill check.  That's enough to make even diehard gamers go insane I think.  Especially when there's other things that can be done besides standing in front of a door and closing/opening it.<P>Instill Doubt - This skill has too many checks, takes a considerably long time to take effect, and takes a LONG time to get skill checks.  Again, another skill that takes forever to bring up with limited uses.  I suggest looking at the skill checks for this one and perhaps reducing some checks for a successful ID.<P>Weapon Variety - The selection of rogue weapons are appealing.  However, considering that rogues are limited to low damage weapons [because of backstab], can we see some more rogue only offhand slashers with higher damage outputs to compensate for the low damage primary pierces?  9 damage piercers [and sometimes even 5 damage piercers] can only go so far when warriors are walking around with 25 damage ONE hand weapons in their primary hands.  Of course, we can never get a 25 damage weapon in our primary hand, thus making an offhand weapon with a great damage ratio OFFHAND only [make it a slasher or even a blunt too] to compensate our lack of damage without backstab in primary hand would be useful.  <P>Disarm - Disarming weapons is always useful... Well anyways... Off to next topic...<P>Kick - Why don't rogues have this skill?  It's a dirty and mean thing to do to a mob... Kick them when they're down... A very roguely thing in fact.  Not much damage, but a little skill to add to our arsenal wouldn't hurt.  A little more damage when the mob is beating on us from the front side would be acceptable. Or when we need an extra taunt to keep the mob on us [when that rare chance occurs and we are needed to use riposte/dodge disciplines for uber mob encounters].</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>THIS MESSAGE BOARD STARTED OUT SLOW BUT ITS ROLLIN NOW.<P>I've seen alot of good ideas i.e. ability to track humanoids, pc, npc's maybe at higher lvl's 9we are assassins after all..lol), and sneak+hide through zones since all the other invis's can adn the concept of zones isnt really in line with the roleplaying aspect.<P>Another ideal I got to help rogues lockpick skill useablity is making quest where there are boxes and containers that can only be picked by rogues (or bard with ability etc).  The boxes could contain quest items...money or nothing.  But to prevent dishonest rogues maybe it can be picked by us clicking on the person with our lockpicks in hand.  You would increase the rogues "lovability by other classes" .. lol and would give us more use for that skill at lower lvl and have something else to practice on.

</FONT><HR>Absor rogues are the only tank class that is also 100% dependent on other tank classes.  I mean if there is no other tank class that I can evade to get the monster away from me I'm toast.  This is a huge handicap for rogues getting into groups.<P>Give us a rogue only shields that we could use to make us semi tanks in an emergency.  The reason I would have these shields at different levels is allow rogues to become a semi-weak tanks if the party has no other tank.  Maybe we could tank slightly less than a Pally with the shield and cleric buffs.  I mean I think the rogue is the only class in the game, if there is no other tank in the game we just don't play!.  If you gave us a real nice shield that we could be a little more group friendly. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Once a rogue attains double backstab at 55th level and a ragebringer, they are in very good shape and contribute very well to any raid or group. However before this point rogues suffer quite a bit. Ragebringer is a 15 damage weapon with a good damage delay ratio and haste to boot. It's quite an excellent partner to double backstab. However, for all the rest of a rogue's career before this ragebringer and double backstab stuff, a rogue is typically using a 10 damage weapon and puts out rather weak backstab performance. Any group that doesn't need a lockpicker, a trap disarmer, or a sneak/hide person (in other words 98% of the time) will look at a rogue's contribution to the group purely in terms of damage. They will find it marginal when a warrior can do almost as much damage plus tank and taunt, a monk can do almost as much and feign pull, a wizard can do about as much as well as snare, stun, and evac, a mage or necro can do more damage and offer other benefits as well. Plus a rogue can outdamage none of these classes without someone to taunt and reliably present a back to stab. If the monster switches back and forth a lot, backstabs are certain to be missed and the edge deteroirates even further. Frankly, the rogue is pretty much at the bottom of the list from 10-54 in a typical group. It is at this range of levels the class really needs all the help it can get.<P>1. The most obvious, backstab from 10-54.<P>Right now from 10-54 a typical rogue's backstab just isn't a big enough contribution to make up for their lack of diversity in battle. Indeed, in battle NO other class is as singularly focused as a rogue. Backstab has to justify that narrowness for groups looking to add members. This is doubly important because you cannot even consider adding a rogue in your group until you have already filled at *least* half the group positions. Towards this end rogues in this level range need to do more backstab damage to justify their existance. <P>There are several ways to do this:<BR>a) Add in more rogue piercers with good damage/delay figures in the 10-14 damage range designed to be acquired within the 10-54 level range<BR>b) Halve the cycle time on a backstab that fails becuase the mob was facing the wrong way. It is very common for a mob to switch facing too abruptly to catch or it switches facing on the server before the client updates and shows it facing you. Even with the best reflexes in the world, you can have quite a few backstabs spoiled that way. Halving the recycle time when a rogue "frontstabs" instead will reduce the penalty for the miss and offer a very small improvement in face-to-face combat when employed intentionally. <BR>c) Put in a sliding scale on double backstab. Allow a rogue as low as 10th level to double backstab - very rarely - but the chance to double backstab very slowly increases throughout the levels until 55th level where it intersects with the existing double backstab skill<P>or some kind of combination of the above, whatever.<P>2. Poison<P>Simply put, it's nothing but a time, money, and space sink. While the great number of recipes are appreciated, the time, expense, and worst of all, bank and backpack storage demands that the poison craft requires simply doesn't add up to a worthwhile result. Time invested vs. reward is exceedingly bad. Now maybe this is meant to be nothing but flavor, but honestly it has no value at all other than "goofing off" value at any point in a rogue's life, whether 20 or 60. <P>3. The erudite mask of deception<P>Is in a really strange place in Charasis. You are most likely to camp the bloke who drops the mask if you need his key. However, as a rogue, your group doesn't need a key, and thus a rogue is unlikely to loot such a mask for himself unless he twists enough arms to get the group to camp exclusively for what most people would consider to be a frivolous item.<P>Naturally #1 is by far the most important issue, 2 and 3 are kind of side issues.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Just make new throwing weapons that are useful common drops off mobs (common as in basic gem and coin common).  We pick them up and dont mind expending them.  They would zero resell cost to stores.

</FONT><HR>1) Rogues are supposed to be tanks, so I think our Poison Resistance should increase in much the same way a Warrior's Magic Resistance increases.  A level 10 cleric with Endure Poison cast on himself has more PR than a level 60 rogue.<P>2) Aside from a couple exceptions, throwing weapons are a joke.  If the Halfling Knife (12 damage, 42 delay, 60 range) was added to the Rivervale Rogues' merchant, it would let a rogue choose whether to pull with decent damage (either a backstab or a bow pull), or gamble on a critical (or deadly strike when behind the mob).  Right now throwing does nowhere near the damage of a bow, and few throwing weapons can pull from 70+ range.  The halfling Knife is already in the game, it's just a big pain giving Sir Morgan all your money to get a few of them.<P>3)Sneak/Hide through zones.<P>4)Make Ravenscale a quest!!!<P>5)Get new dagger graphics, and if you have them, use them - currently most daggers, dirks, and stilettos look like small toothpicks.  How about something that's bigger than the small dagger graphic, but shorter that a short sword, and still tapers to a point?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>NO DROP....<P>Our class specific armor is one of the easiest to get and farmed alot..whether for profit or twink.  There is no reason why if a group is camping in Cazic Thule and a mob drops ravenscale that the only rogue in the group should have to roll to get his armor.  I seen this the other day and was appauled.  The person who won it then charges him an outrageous amount of money for it, that is bad form in itself.  I think it should be no drop since it is our armor anyway and that would make us have to work alittle harder and you wouldnt see a lvl 1 in ravenscale.

</FONT><HR>Evade - You brought it up, Absor, no way to avoid it.<P>Simply put, this new skill saved the rogue class.<P>Before this skill was implemented there were a lot of complaints about rogues lacking defensive skills.  This was before all the new Kunark, Epic, and Velious weapons, as well as melee disciplines, that helped the real tanks taunt NPCs onto them.  I can accept that it has become a little too powerful now with the expanded Hate lists.  You can change it, but be careful not to over-do it.<P>Lets say, for example, that the 'lists' used to handle 8 people, and now handle 16.  The rogue used to drop down - at most - to #8 on a successful Evade, but now drops to #16.  A list that long only matters in multi-group encounters, but I'll agree that's a little too powerful.  If it is changed, then just make sure that it's at LEAST as good as it used to be before the list was expanded - drop them down to around #8 (i.e., bottom of the 'old' list).  At the very least, no less than 1 group's worth of agro (6), but no more than 2 group's worth (12).  In single groups he should still drop to the bottom, but for multiple groups he shouldn't be dropping below a dozen other people when he's still in active melee.  Note, my numbers are examples, but I'm sure Absor will get the point.  Do it right the first time (PLEASE!) or don't mess with it at all.<P>On to other skills...<P>Dodge:  Sort of annoying that we're capped at a skill of 150 until level 51, then it eventually goes up to 210.  You'd THINK a rogue would be a little more nimble than that.<P>Safe Fall:  What's the deal with it being capped at 94?  C'mon, let us Master it at 100.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Pickpocket:  Despite the denials in the past that it was never changed, it was in fact fixed (not nerfed) a long time ago so that things stolen were actually on the NPC and not coming out of a seperate loot pool.  Nothing has to change here, although I would appreciate some acknowledgement that it was changed and that we were lied to when told it always worked that way.  (For you newbies, this was way back before we were being told what went into every patch, and customer service was still 'experiencing growing pains' around here.)<P>The rest of the skills I'm okay with.  Not familiar with all the disciplines yet, the more experienced rogues can discuss those issues.<P>Wishlist:  Report Backstabs like Crits.  Give us something to impress our groups with.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><BR>Of course if you do that there should also be an option to turn off all of those types of damage reporting to reduce battle spam.<P>Assassinate:  I've seen screenshots of level 60 rogues assassinating NPCs.  I'm assuming they cannot assassinate anything they'd get Experience for at level 60 - that would be way over the top.  However, I did note the message, and it can use some work.  If possible, could it include the NPCs name instead of 'their Target'?<P>All in all I think the rogue class is in pretty good shape.  Just don't go overboard if you nerf Evade and we'll be happy.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>This has been said already but I want to repeat it so that you know it is important.<P>I understand that the way evade currently works is to move rogues to the bottom of the hate list and that this is not the way it is supposed to work.  I do agree skills should work as intended, but making too drastic a change to the ability to evade could cause big problems!<P>Lets say you decrease a rogue's ability to reduce thier aggro from thier currently targeted mob ( to evade) to the point where they will be attacked much more than they currently are.  As many have already said, this will hurt the class tremendously.  The number one thing a rogue brings to a group is his ability to do damage, and by reducing a rogue's ability evade you remove the ability for a rogue to consistently do damage from behind.  You have to consider the fact that rogues sometimes have to be in group where the main tank is not a warrior (who are the best taunters) or is a warrior of lower level.  In this situation, if a rogue's ability to evade is decreased, the warrior he/she is paired with will not be able to keep the mob on him/her.  I recently began playing a rogue who is now of the 40th level.  If I group with tanks who are of more than 4 levels below me (many of my guildmates) they have much difficulty keeping things on them during the beginning of the battle until I am able to land an evade (failures and the "You must be perfectly still to hide" message sometimes cause this to take a while).  <P>Please don't make it so all of us rogues can only group with members of higher than ourselves.  Our evade skill is the tool we use to do the damage we can do, and we do not need to do any less damage.<P>Thanks for reading.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Jeeze I dont think any of you even play rogues, you must be necros and druids trying to make another class the target of the nerf stick. No, to be fair, maybe you are ubers who started out with some other character and now think rogues are semiuseful to have in your group at level 60. To bring any caster class besides wizards down to the level of rogues would require massive nerfs. Rogues are ok at the highest levels but it is a long a tedious fight to get there if you are not a massive twink that gets powerleveled by your friends. Consider two people that start playing everquest at the same time... who will get to 40th faster if they play the same number of hours each week: the rogue, the druid, the necromancer, or the enchanter. Even before the penalties were removed and rogues supposedly got the best xp in the game, it still wasnt even close to being the rogue. The rogue had to sit there waiting to be bound, then had to hike to the actual fighting area, then find a group. Meanwhile the druid and necromancer have killed everything in the desired zone solo, got bored, and now the druid is teleporting (and sowing,binding,buffing) for plat.  The rogue in the teens wastes precious time wondering where the heck he is supposed to use half his skills until someone tells them he really only has 2: backstab and evade.<P>Here is what is wrong with rogues:<BR>1)  While definitely needing groups to be effective, they are not very necessary to groups except in certain (HIGH LEVEL) dungeons. Contrast this to druids, who are very much desired in groups but have no need for groups.<BR>2) They started at as the most broken class in the game and although great strides in this area, considering where they started they still have a ways to go. Making one high level dungeon with traps does not cut it when the traps skills are gained in the teens. Also the pick locks skill is gained at a level where it is only useful in Befallen for quite some time. To add insult to injury, some of the abilities they gained to make up for their useless skills were more useless skills!<BR>3) There are very few quests for rogues. And there are even fewer worth doing. Isn't this game called EVERQUEST?<BR>4) Ravenscale<P>What rogues need:<BR>1) More low and midlevel dungeons with traps and locked doors. The easiest way to do this: locked and trapped treasure chests.  That way they will not make a rogue 100% necessary, just make it so you need a rogue (or in a pinch a bard) to maximize your loot... as it should be. Put Ravenscale or some other good rogue equipment in these chests. Lock the doors in Cazic Thule! Then at least people would need a rogue in their group to get Ravenscale. So he would at least have a 1 out of 6 chance of getting it.<BR>2) More midlevel quests. These quests for rogues should make use of roguish skills like the burning rapier does. There should be doors to pick, items to pickpocket, dangerous creatures to sneak by, and poisons to make.<BR>3) Poison and throwing made so they are actually useful instead of a joke. The damage poisons do the equivalent of one backstab, and considering the time and money required are useless. Why spend an hour looking for a one use item that doesnt stack and does as much damage as you do in one hit? The components need to drop more often, be cheaper, and the damage should be upped. Poisons should be stackable. The number of doses should be increased. You should be able to poison thrown weapons. There should be better thrown weapons that do more damage on a critical.<BR>4) This applies to melee classes in general: MAKE DISARM USEFUL! Mobs still do the same damage when disarmed! They should do less damage! You should be able to disarm magic weapons, I know there are problems with making it too easy to steal the weapons, but you should fix it so it goes into the mobs inventory. I imagine that a mob automatically instantly equips any weapon in its inventory, but that should be changed.<BR>5) I think the distance between apply and make poison should be spread out. Specifically, apply poison should be lowered in level.  The levels between apply and make go quickly so there is hardly any point to getting any poison before you can make it.<BR>6) Be able to combine food with poison. Give it to a mob and he eats eat and gets very sick. And very mad at you if he lives!<BR>7) This is just a crazy dream, but give rogues (and rangers) the ability to SET TRAPS. This would work as a pet that was completely immobile. And in PvP would make the sense/disarm traps skills useful. It would require careful thought as to how to make i balanced of course, but the important thing is that it would be really cool! Considering that these wouldnt move it wouldnt step on the toes of magicians and other pet classes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alright.. let me just start off by saying that i've played my rogue to 30.. and continue playing him daily.  I love the class.  I *also* play on rallos zek.  Here are my ideas.<P>Poison:<BR>stackable.. combinable.. whatever.. just do it.. i'm carrying a backpack full of pvp gear and two backpacks full of poisons.. as well as a few backpacks in the bank for poison supplies.. plus i need 21 spaces to bag my gear if needed.  Add in food.. water.. bandages.. shurikens.. and the treasures i find along my way.. and that equals one angry rogue.<P>Instill Doubt: Works fine.. i love it<P>Evade: Please dont nerf it so that i cant evade onto my already poorly-taunting warrior in my poorly-set-up pick up group that i had to wait an hour to get into... other than that... it would be nice if it didnt run like mad for the enchanter or cleric every time i did it.<P>Hide/sneak: It would be nice if it could be made so that it works across zone lines and such.. but i understand the limitations of the client and the server.. and i know it would be very hard to do.<P>Throwing: Get rid of the too-close to throw.. too far to melee zone.. that's just ubsurd.<P>PvP Issues: I'd really like to see either...<BR>1) pickpocketing allowed.. restrictions of course<BR>or...<BR>2) Have a successful evade drop you from a person's targeting.. this would not interrupt casting if it were already in progress.<BR>or...<BR>3) Implement a spell called "Gather Shadows".. and make it the only way to see "hidden" player charachters... i'm sick of sneaking at super slow speed just to see some caster begin to unload on me... this would give us a nice chance of survival.<P>Pick one.. or pick none... they would conflict if two were implemented... and they arent really necessary.. but it would give me a ******* chance to survive a battle if i dont have 100+mr<P>My Wish List:<BR>Replace the level 40 discipline for all melees known as "fearless" with "sprint"... allows you to give yourself spirit of the cheetah... with MAJOR stamina drain so that after 15 seconds of running.. your stamina runs out.. and the discipline turns off.  It would void hide/sneak when turned on.. and melee of all types would not be allowed during those 15 seconds.  Might sound a tad bit too greedy.. but i'm sure you could find a way to beat it severely with the "stick-o-nerfing" untill it's not considered to be Un-balancing.<P><BR>General:<BR>Rogues are doing fine.. we do large ammounts of damage.. and we make out great in loot.  My main concerns are about the PvP issues.. but i doubt any of those will be changed.  Please consider them.. there are more PvP rogues than everyone may think.. and they need love too..  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I personally understand why Poison will never be made a real useful skill. Rogues are at the top of the damage-dealing list; nothing can be added that will increase that.  So I don't care if they are stackable or not because I'm not wasting time farming green mobs for ingredients for a poison that is only going to do a tiny bit of damage to the mob, once, at the beginning of the fight.  I'd much rather be out there gaining experience, going up in levels, and finding better equipment.<BR>  <P>Here are some things I don't think I saw mentioned in any of the above posts:<BR>  <BR>Sneak/Hide is canceled if you loot a mob (even if you get "You can't loot this corpse" message), loot your own corpse, or do a trade (PC or NPC).  Yet the buttons not only DON'T ungrey, you also DON'T get the "You stop hiding/sneaking" message.  You also still move at sneak speed and when you do hit the sneak or hide buttons again only THEN do they ungrey and THEN give you the message that you've stopped sneaking / hiding.  Either stop these actions from breaking sneak/hide or ungrey the buttons and give us the message.<P>Put some other effect on the Mrylokar Boots.  The Fade spell is the low-level Shadow Step that is supposed to move the caster a short random distance from the mob he/she is fighting so he/she has a better chance of escaping.  Yet the casting time on the Mrylokar Boots is very long, not to mention no channeling skill, so that the effect will never, ever, not in a million years, go off in combat.  So what's the point?  I thought it was silly I had to wait all that time just to cast Ultravision on myself, but at least after I do it, the end all effect of the spell works... I actually have the ability to see with Ultravision.  I have never been teleported a random short distance from a mob I was fighting; I'm always interrupted.<P>Burning Rapier quest.  It's been awhile since I've done this quest so excuse me for not remember the exact details.  But there is something with the two gems you turn in at the end, and one of them is named wrong.  Talking with several guides I get the impression that 80% of all rogues doing this quest are confused by this and either petition or wind up having higher level rogues calm their fears that they are screwed and have to start over.<P>More dungeon designs along the lines of Howling Stones, where a party with out a rogue can kill a mob to get the key to one part of the dungeon, where they get a key to the next, where they can get the key to the next, etc. OR they can have a rogue to enter any section in any order.  That's how you make lockpicking useful.  The occasional "only with a rogue" sections ala Sebilis, but most should be rogue short cuts.  That way nobody is really suffering one way or another.<P><BR>Things I agree on from other's posts:<P>Yes I think you need to introduce some longer range, stackable throwing weapons.  Love those that are summoned off the Monk Velious bracer, and would love to see those put on the Mrylokar Bracer instead of the normal 50 range throwing daggers.  Tinkered throwing weapons would even be nice.<P>A quest for Soul Bound Lockpicks would be nice.<P>Sneak/hide not breaking across zones.  I have a fast connection though so I can usually hit my sneak/hide before mobs have a chance to aggro... well most of the time.<P>And I have to agree with those people who have said that Evade doesn't currently put us at the bottom of the hate list.  I have seen multiple successful evades not turn the mob back on the taunting warrior.  Not to mention added fun mob hits combined with even the tinniest bit of lag (think about the lag that causes a lot of players to go link dead during large Uber raid mobs) and you get the "can't hide while moving message."  I have always had my suspicions that the "hate list" agro code wasn't doing exactly what you guys think it's doing anyway.  I remember several old arguments where Abashi denied that missed swings counted toward agro.  Please look into this code in depth before you monkey with Evade.  Heck it might even solve the poor ranger's problem... you know the same one rogues used to have, only worse, before you put in evade.  <P>I was even going to leap into the Warrior thread at one point and ask that their Taunt skill be increased a bit because at 54 using a 10/20 Trak. Tooth and a 12/24 Crystalline Short Sword (Neither Proc.) my 59th level Warrior friend sometimes has a hard time keeping mobs taunted onto him duel wielding 10/21 Blood Points that do Proc.  Warriors who insist on duel wielding 9/19 Lamentations (no Proc.) have a horrible time keeping the mobs on them, and I wind up having lots of use for the /bleed emote. <P>And remember without another melee class there to evade onto, at least at high levels, there is no combat going on.  We can't tank... at all... even with a cleric dumping mana into us like money into the public education system.<P>Sentris Ravenstorm of Mithanial Marr<BR>Don’t think of me as a guildless mercenary rogue for hire…<BR>Think of me as networking professional adventurer!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>As a 42nd rogue, I can say that while I like Evade, I don't use it too much.  I rely on melee range as a more reliable form of taunt control, and use Evade only when I chain proc or just quad then land a high BS or something like that.  It works for me pretty well.  Not all the time.  Heh, I'm also still using a Burning Rapier primary, that might have something to do with it.<P>But... if you're going to nerf it, at least make it uninterruptible.  Half the time it's because we're laggy and the server doesn't realize we've stopped moving to Evade yet.  The other half of the time the mob bashes you or something.<P>And fix it so the message is actually right in those odd instances where max melee range and chain successful evades don't do anything.  Remember what those monk were talking about for the 'frenzy code' with FD in normal combat?  Same thing with us, sometimes.  There are times when the mob simply *will not* get off you.  If this is as intended, fine, but fix the message so it says you failed.  At least then you know to back out if things are bad.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I would just like to put in my two coppers worth.<P>First of all, I have a theory on the evade problem. If hate is based on a numeric value and everyone fighting the mob has a similar value for example<BR>Rogue 800<BR>Warrior 790<BR>Cleric 770<BR>Rogue evades:<BR>Warrior 800<BR>Cleric 770<BR>Rogue 769 (He is now on the bottom of the list)<BR>Then the rogue hits with a dual weilding doubleattack while the warrior hits with a big two hander<BR>Rogue 920<BR>warrior 918<BR>cleric 770<BR>Rogue back on top. mob never turned around. Evade succeeded, but seemed to fail...<P>I have no idea if this is how it works, but if so, haveing it changed to lower the hate list by a given amount might (and I say this hesitantly) actually be helpful to the rogue class assumeing that it will put us a considerable distance down the hate list. <P>Now, on with suggestions:<P>1: Evade is still broken, however. You should not get a failure message because you got hit and combat and thus "moved". That is a bug that needs to be fixed. Either make hide and thus evade able to use on the run, or make a seperate skill for evade. Dodgeing out of combat without moving is inconsistant with it's purpose.<P>2: Make sneak/hide persist over zones. If you can't make do that because of the way hide is coded, make an optional command so that you can set it so that you automatically sneak/hide every time you zone and/or log in, similar to the option to automatically default to run when you log on to eq.<P>3: Stackable/multiple charge poisons. I understand that there is a problem with makeing right clickable items stackable. The best solution I can think of this would be to make a container that combines poisons of the same type into a multi-charge item of the same effect. For example. make a box with 6 or 10 slots. make it very heavy if you like so people will only use it at the bank. you put in ten asp poisons and you get back a ten charge asp poison.<P>4: I liked the idea of haveing sneak speed skill based. I agree that you should be able to sneak faster as you get better at it and I think this should apply to everyone who can sneak as a non racial skill. It's great that we get this ability at post 50 levels, but many rogues never get that far...<P>and now back to evade...<P>As anyone who has played a rogue knows, we have the worst armor class of any melee or hibrid class. We have the lowest hitpoints of any melee or hybrid class, often less than half of a real, plate wearing tank. We have a need, (and I mean NEED) to be able to evade damage or we will become an incredible burden to a group and will not be able to level beyond the mid 40's.<P>It is already very hard to find a group as a rogue. I have spent hours running from zone to zone, looking, hopeing, oocing and even occationally auctioning for a group only to be turned down because they feel that rogues are too wimpy to tank and don't contribute enough damage to be worth taking up a slot.<P>I Beg of you. If you do change the functionality of evade, please, please, please Test it very carefully. If it reduces the effectiveness of evade then you may very well be nailing the final nail into the coffin of mid to high level rogues who haven't reached the Ragebringer/double backstab level of allure...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here are some improvements I think the rogue class needs in the order of most importance (to me).<P>1. Hide/Sneak across zone boundaries. The zone boundaries are really an implementation detail needed to keep the system distributed and not overloaded. Invis/Camouflage as spell effects, have the ability to cross zone boundaries without balance problems. Hide/Sneak should as well.<P>2. Stackable or multiple charge poisons. It has been stated that there are technical reasons why this cannot be done, but never been said that there is a balance issue against doing it. I had an idea that was ignored at http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/051504.html that should allow multiple charges without changing the game engine at all. Please take a look at this.<P>3. Haven't seen this myself, but I've read that our improved sneak speed post level 50 only applies to forward movement on dry land. Please make this speed improvement apply to backwards movement and swimming (before I get to that level myself).<P>I am concerned a bit about the discussion of the evade change (nerf). In my experience, evade does not work as Absor described. A successful evade does not put me at the bottom of the hate list every time. If it did, wouldn't it take more than a single hit to be brought back to the top? Not to mention those times that the skill succeeds but there is no noticeable effect on mob behavior.<P>And come on, has any rogue EVER evaded a mob to have it run off to the bard/cleric across the zone who has no idea how they got on the aggro list? If they have, please let me know how and I'll have a new escape skill for soloing.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>--- Geffin Dagrifter<BR>    Wealth Redistribution Engineer<BR>    Level 47, E'ci</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Oh yeah, and you seem to have it in your head that if you evade, the mob will run across the zone or something.  This only works when you're melee kiting a mob.<P>(This is why we work so well with necros and druids.)<P>Mobs rarely, if ever, run that far with me.  They seem to go for whoever last did a lot of taunt - if I just got the mob on me, it's the tank.  If someone just nuked, the caster.  (That's why I don't use Evade too much, especially with lots of casters - it aggroes them easily).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I could sit here and debate many of the points about, praising the good ones and ranting about the bad ones but I'm not here to do that today. I skimmed over most of this, and it's generally the same thing over and over. Maybe you don't like us reposting stuff but it does get the point across.<P>First though I make these requests:<P>1) My first reccomendation if you want to learn the rogue desires is to go to the Safehouse. I know you don't want to follow links or visit sites. I hope that you'll make an exception for rogues. Why? Because, with the possible exception of bards, rogue are the -only- class which has a collective community across all servers. This is where you'll find the info you need. Aye, it's roughly the same here, but at the Safehouse (and those who go there will know hehehe) flames, idiotic posts, etc. are simply not tolerated, so hopefully you could cut to the meat of the argument faster.<P>2) Secondly, I suggest a scheduled "Rogue PvP Talk" thread. -PvP Rogues are balanced in my opinion, however the +PvP Rogue is imbalanced.<P>Anyway, you may or may not do that, so here are my main concerns. None of these affects balance (aside from PvP issues) in my opinion, but simply polishes up the rough spots on the class.<P>1) Raise the Safefall cap to 200. Unless there is a good reason not to, go ahead for goodness sakes. It's silly not to.<P>2) Add locks and traps to the pre-kunark/velios world. But don't make the needed skills as 2001+, add something for the mid-level Rogue, so he doesn't have to sit in Befallen for a few hours maxing his rusty pick lock skills.<P>3) More Ro quests. Ideas include more masks (an easy good-race mask would be nice, to offset the Dark Elf one) and soulbound lock picks.<P>3) Dyeable chain. Glad I can dye it, but I would really like to flaunt my wares.<P>4) Pick pocket post 45. Once gaining a skill of 201 in Pick Pocket (level 51), mobs up to level 55 could be pick pocketed. This offsets balance issues by requiring the rogue to be high-level.<P>5) Evade. Won't comment here, I'll have to see what you guys do to it.<P>6) Throwing weapons. A year ago Thursday, you promised many more throwing weapons to make the skill more viable. I'm waiting.<P>7) Forage. I don't wanna be a foraging tree hugger, but I wouldn't mind being able to scrounge up a poison component every now and then. A skill of 50 in Forage and a chance to forage a poison component would be a nice addition to the rogue's repoitoire of out-of-combat skills. Please add the same thing to Shamen for alchemy.<P>8) Multi-charge poisons. You claim it cannot be done with the current engine. Frankly, I belice you here, it cannot be stackable or chargeable due to engine difficulties. HOWEVER, you guys are not creative enough, I'll shortly post a work-around for this problem, please take it into consideration.<P>9) Evade in PvP. Remove us from the target box. If a spell is already casting, we'll be hit and unhidden anyway, but do this for us. To please the clerics, make it so this only affects people we aren't grouped with.<P>10) Poison resistance increases either 1) by level or 2) by poison (apply or make) skill.<P>11) Apply poison is based on a timer which is based on the skill itself. It never fails, just determines the time to apply. Abashi promised us he'd look into it awhile back. I'm waiting.<P>12) Apply works like Bind Wound. You r-click it and you crouch, apply, stand.<P>13) Track. Works only on humanoid creatues. Maybe I am mistaken but I thought we were assassings.<P>14) Kick. Caps at 50. Maybe don't even give us the button, but just the skill. This would help Instill Doubt problems.<P>15) Taunt. Unless there is a reason not to have it, give it to us. Who is the better taunter, a holy paladin or the foul-mouthed rogue cussin out a mob ? Cap it low if ya want.<P>16) Chance to Stun on a ***front stab*** (NOT backstabs). Use this formula to determine the chance of a Rogue to stun: [(Level / 10) ^ 2] * 2. This gives a level 60 rogue ~70% chance to stun (but only from the front). This would 1) compensate for a mob turning on you 2) increase a rogue's solo-ability without affecting much on groupplay 3) give some strategy as to which is better, BS'ing or FS'ing.<P>17) Sneak works in water.<P>18) Rogue and monks: doubled breathing time in water. Why? Rogues because they should be the masters of escape and monks because they are the masers of their body.<P>19) Illusions can be clicked off<P>20) Either unlock Backstab from Instill Doubt, or grey them both.<P>21) Explain how to Evade somewhere. I am telling level 20 Rogues what evade is hehe.<P>22) Put us in the hands of Kendrick =)<P>Well quite a list, but is it overpowering? Not really, just some polishing here and touching up there, clearing up what is a bug/feature whatever you call it. An attempt to fix some downright silly things (read: Safefall cap).<P>My explanation on how to "charge" poisons coming shortly.<P><BR>Canbik the Rogue<BR>Rallos Zek<BR>A Safehouser</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Things id like to see:<P>1) Poison on a different resist table. Someone else mentioned this and i think its a great idea. There are so many times when i thought, "maybe ill go make some poison.. Nah, whats the point it will just get resisted and I'll be out the time and the cash." Poison gets resisted WAY to much to be useful, and who wants to farm greens for hours only to have their time be wasted. I understand that other classes have Poison based effects/magic, this is why our poisons need to be on a different table. Then you can make sure their spells are still resisted etc. at whatever percentage you want but ours, which are not used nearly as much, would get resisted less often. Its frustrating to spend the time required to make a poison and succesfully apply it, only to have it be resisted most of the time.<P>2)Make backstab give a message that all can see, like critical hits. I get a 449/442 double backstab off.. i want people to see it! heh. Really though, how many times have you Rogues been in a group and a warrior gets off some 300+ Cripple and people say "OMG that was a HUGE hit" and laughed to your self knowing that its feeble compared to some of the backstab damage you pulled off seconds before that.. Higher lvl Rogues know what im talking about.<P>3)Effects on the Ragebringer. They dont have to be Crazy ass effects. I want subtle, yet noticeable effects that myself and everyone else will say, "Holy crap! i see you got your epic, that's a SWEET effect !" I don't know what... Maybe like nearly invisible flames that really get more noticable and brighter when you start attacking. Like your seething with fury or something. The current effect, if you want to call it that, is weak and not a good representation of the weapon IMO.<P>4)We need Thrown weapons that dont suck. There aren't really any throwing weapons i can think of that would MAKE me want to train this skill up anymore. Only reason i have the 180ish skill i do is from getting bored and summoning daggers to throw at mobs while im looking for a group. How about some player made thrown weapons better than store bought ones. This would open up a whole new reason for fletchers to raise their skill up.<P>5)More damage on the Throwing daggers Crits/deadly strikes. Give us a disc like the Rangers get but for thrown weapons. A ranger told me he hit a mob for 192 with his disc on with his BOW! Damn, I want that kind of discipline for throw weapons. Maybe then I'd use them..<P>6)Have evade lose targeting on you. How lame is it to Duel a caster, go hide from them, only to have them blast you outta nowhere with a random dd because they still have you targeted. LAME. I should be able to Evade a PC almost as well as an NPC. It doesnt have to work every time, just enough that if i go to hide from the bastard, i can evade enough to eventually detarget me.<P>7)NEW QUESTS. Make the Troch Skean, which is obtained as part of the Rogue epic, into a quest for a nice offhand weapon. It doesnt have to be Ragebringer caliber, but i'd turn in my Burning rapier and the other rapiers (or whatever Verant dreamed up to turn in) for an offhand that was better than this Bloodpoint im using... Just in general, a few nice pieces that make everyone go, "DAMN that thing kicks ass". Kinda like the sky quests, but with good loot as a reward )<P>8 )Stackable poisons. Like it was said before, if a Shaman gets stacking Potions, we should get stackable Poisons. This makes sense because a rogue making a poison could just make a much more concentrated poison that has multiple uses rather than a one shot poison that it is now.<P>9 )Increase the drop rate on poison components. I have spent hours and hours farming Skorpikos for Venom sacs and have only gotten a few poisons out of it. Not to mention the fact that they get resisted so much, whats the point? There just isn't much reward at the moment for me to spend my time/money making poison. Sure i could make 20 poisons if i took the time.. but where would i put them? Fill up 3 bags with poison? I don't think so. I need all the space for the loot im getting =)<P>10)The High Elf Mask quest! Put it in ! we beat ourselves to death trying to find it in the game, so put it in already! This goes with the entire story line of the Ragebringer. Why not implement it? That way i can sneak into Faydark and laugh at all the Tunare followers and show them the Heads of their treehuggin hippie friends i killed in PoG.<P>11 ) Soulbound lockpicks. I REALLY could have used these a several times. Seems to me that a skilled rogue would be able to pick a lock with random bits of wire/metal that might be laying around. A soulbound set of lockpicks would be a representation of that. OR show that im a Bad Ass Lockpicking Llama, and i have done this really hard quest that allows me to have lockpicks on me at all times. Many of the other classes have quested items in the game that start in the Temple of Sol Ro, this quest could start there.<P>12)MORE locked doors! There just arent enough of them In my opinon. I need more to unlock than running a_random_group01 to the crypt. Don't these Boss mobs know we are coming to pillage their lands? I mean they SAY that we wont Ruin their lands, but they dont even take a few seconds to lock a few doors to try to stop us. I mean, if i had some nice loot, i would lock the stuff up! If not Locked doors, how about locked chests? with traps?<P>13)Effects on the burning rapier. This should have been done when this item came out IMO. When i got my Burning Rapier, i was disappointed it didnt have effects. Give it Flaming effects like the FA, just not as huge. Something subtle that makes mid-lvl rogues proud to be break the thing off in some mobs back.<P>14) Evading during combat is often ineffective due to lag or the fact that Rogues have to move around alot during combat to get to the back of the enemy. I should not be getting a "you cannot hide while moving message" while trying to evade in combat. Im forced to move by the nature of my combat skills. Is there anything that can be done about this?<P>Guilen Imallama <BR>Immortal Vision<BR>56 Rogue of Quellious<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Here are my toughts about the Rogue Class, as a whole it's a pretty well balanced class but with some very annoying problems/issues that should be fixed.<P>From early indication lots of thing being asked as simple request here won't be enhanced mainly due to what i see is the way Everquest is Coded to these i offer an alternative that i think wouldn't require tooo much to implement.<P>1) Sneak/hide across zone: I like most would love this to work across zones, but i'm realistic and doubt it will happens due to the way everquest is coded. Since this is a skill and not a spell like ability. To this i offer the alternative that i think wouldn't be too hard to implement and would probably serve EQ as a whole just not one class. <P>This solutions could just be as simple as not being KOS for the first 10-15 seconds when you zone in, that way we would have plenty of time to hit the sneak/hide button move. But for this to not be too overpowering for casting classes, all offense skills wouldn't work for that zone in. This would have the added advantage of people not dying while they zone as they have no clue what's on the other side.<P>Another solutions to his is make the first few feet at a zoneline a safe area that mobs cannot see in, and we can't attack from. <P>Maybe this is workable, maybe it not but i'm offering a solution to a most frustrating problem to all class just not Rogue. Zoning and finding instant death.<P>2) Stackable Poison: Again this i can see where this could be a problem. Unlike Alchemy where the potioons actually cast spells, poison requires a skill to apply, so i could see where stackable poison could be an issue. <P>But to that i offer the following solutions, how about to allow us to create stack of poison, to which we need to remove one dose from before we apply. Like removing the bottle from a container, placing it in your inventory slot and then applying. It would be a 2 step process, but that is better then not having stackable poison.<P>3) Illusions Masks: Okay it would be fun to allow us to get more mask for all the races in games. I can see this stepping over the enchanter domain. But you guys did make a lute that turn bards into werewolves. Why not instead of making more masks, give us the ability to quest for disguise kits that would be just a couple charges.<P>4) Illusions: We should be able to click off illusions.<P>5) Evade: i won't comment on evade until you guys exactly tell us how you going to fix it. But starting a discussion on how to fix/improve Rogue with a nerf is a tad annoying. Basically, tells us rogue don't espect anything out of this other then a nerf.<P>6) Piercers: Personnaly, i hate the fact that most of the new piercers in velious seem to be a spears. Seriously, i don't see myself as an assasin going around with a stick as tall as me to try to assasinate a mob. More dagger type piercers should be added or at the very least offer a way to transfer these spears into piercer via quests.<P>7) We need more quest: Seriously all other class has a serie of quest they can do to take the boredom out of leveling. Other then burning rapier we don't have anything of worth to quest for. This game is called EverQuest not EverCamp, please add more interesting quest, specially some that would require the use of poisoning/pickpocketing/disarming traps and so on.<P>8) Tracking: We are assasins, and should be able to track our pray. Granted not as good as rangers, but we should be on par with Bards. I would rather have a tracking ability limited to city or dungeons then none at all. Since unlike bards/ranger/druids rogue can't solo so this shouldn't be too overpowering.<P>9) Like most have said, it's hard for rogues to get into group as lot of people do not understand our class or fear that we will be stealing form their loot. I can spend hours looking for groups and sometime just giving up and logging. <P>As it stands most group would rather have any other type of melee then rogues, yes we do more damage then most classes but pressed between a ranger and rogue a group will 90% of the time take the ranger as he as the ability to snare/sow.<P>Something should be given to rogues that would make them more group friendly unfortunatly nothing comes to mind at the moment.<P>Regards,<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There's really only one burning issue that still bugs me, although it ceased to be much of a problem post-35th level. This is a concern for the non-twinked, low-to-mid-level rogues trying to find pickup groups...<P>Pickpocket.<P>Pickpocket is essentially a PvP skill - it steals from other players. Why it exists in it's current implementation in a cooperative game (assuming blue servers) is beyond me. Back in the old days (you know, when "rogues sucked"), it contributed to me spending sometimes HOURS trying to get in a group when other classes were finding group slots easily. People needed  cash back then.<P>At one point, Brad maintained the legend that there was a "secondary" pool for pickpocket loot. I understand if that is technologically impossible. But would it be possible to play some other tricks to allow pickpocket to be *purely supplemental* to looted cash / items? Maybe track only a local list for the player for creatures he's recently pickpocketed? <P>Could the refresh rate on pickpocket be dropped to allow this? Maybe pickpocket only allowed a handful of times until you zone (the zone "gets wise to you")? Greatly increase the taunt factor of a failed (and noticed) pickpocket? <P>Anyway - the point being, I'd really, REALLY like to see pickpocket provide completely supplemental cash for rogue characters. At a point in the game's maturity where level 2 characters are running around with level 40 equipment, will a few extra gold pieces really ruin the economy?<P>As to the more common subjects, I have to voice my agreement with poisons and stacking. Poisons are nothing more than a toy, now. Better than they were a year ago, but still nothing that really effects rogue balance. Making poisons stackable probably wouldn't effect rogue balance to any measurable degree. We can still only use them once per combat, really, and they are so expensive and hard to obtain that they'd still only be used on special occasions. But it would be a heck of a lot more convenient and save my bank account some space.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>               ***A Guide to "Charging" Poisons***<P><BR>*Cut and pasted from my post at the Safehouse, hope the formatting works properly*<P>--------------------------------------------------<P>Some sort of poison combining sack like the Shamen have is gonna be needed of course. Now that that's out of the way, try not to get confused =) (* more later)<P>For each type of poison, make 10 clones of it. Let's say we use Injected III as our example. Rather then just having Injected_III, we now have Injected_III_1, Injected_III_2, Injected_III_3,...Injected_III_10. As items work on a numbered system rather then by names, it wouldn't look as tacky of course  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> And each item would have the name Injected III (* more later).<P>At the end of each "effect" for the poison, we'll add this line:<P>Summon item: Injected_III_<P>Thus, the Injected_III_10 will 1) poison your blade and 2) summon you another bottle of Injected_III this time being Injected_III_9. Obviously, the Injected_III_1 would have no summon code on it.<P>* This leaves some interesting possibilites:<P>1) Since there are actually 10 items, combining 3 poisons could just give you a 3 "charge" poison, rather then having to do it at 5 or 10 at a time. Or combining a 4 "charge" and a 6 "charge" would give you the maximum of a 10 "charge" poison.<P>2) Having the "item displayer" or whatever it is that shows an item when you right click it, possibly it could examine the last digit(s) on the item, and then include a line that says "Charges: X". Different technically, but from the players viewpoint would look like a Shaman's potions, save the number of original charges on the potion.<P>Now you are saying, Dang that'd be HARD to code! Well, now is it? Hard is a relative term. In relation of how hard it would be to entirely recode poison, no, I don't think this is hard at all. Simply time consuming.<P>--------------------------------------------------<P>Now please think on this, and bring it up with your coders. Don't ask them if it would take time or whatever, ask them if this would be plausible. Then ask them if they can code it. Either way, I have thought about this much and don't see any flaws in it.<P><BR>Canbik the Rogue<BR>Rallos Zek<BR>A Safehouser<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oh, one more thing. And this is more of a wish list kinda request than an actual expectation.<P>If evade is going to move you down the hate list by a given amount instead of putting you on the bottom of it, it should be able to eventually move you off the list completely. Example<P>Rogue: Hate:1200 "You will not Evade me Tagadin"<BR>evade<BR>Rogue: Hate:700 "You will not evade me Kyrlan, but I'll get to you later Tagadin..."<BR>evade <BR>Rogue: Hate:200 "You will not evade me Jabober, but I'm still mad at the rest of you..."<BR>evade<BR>Rogue: Hate:-300 aka 0 hate "Hmmm, wonder where he went... oh well...<P>At this point the rogue is off the hate list and hidden. Takes a lot of time, and in a long fight, the rogue will probably never evade enough to get off the list unless he is not fighting at all, but it would provide an escape mechinism for those bad suprises that everyone else can get away from.<P>here's an example of how it could work.<P>NastyMob01 Aggro's unexpectedly.<BR>Round 1<BR>Tank fights.<BR>Cleric camps.<BR>Rogue evades.<BR>Monk fights.<P>Round 2<BR>Tank fights<BR>cleric still camping<BR>rogue evades<BR>monk fights<P>Round 3<BR>Tank is probably almost dead<BR>Rogue evades and clears aggro. is now invisible<BR>Monk feigns.<P>At this point if anyone died, corpse recoveries can start if necessary and the rogue is still in place to do it if the need arises. much better than the low hitpoint rogue getting the crap beat out of him and everyone has to start the long walk back or wait for someone to pull the rogues corpse so he can get rezzed to start pulling the other corpses... <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>That's a neat idea Canbic that I missed over at the Safehouse. Your idea requires 800 new items and corresponding effects though.<P>Here is the idea I had and referenced through a link above (but Absor doesn't want to follow links so here it is again).<P>---- BEGIN QUOTE ----<P>Whenever the idea of stackable or charged poisons is brought up, Verant rejects the notion because it is not possible with the current game engine. Apparently stackable items cannot have effects (alcohol is not an effect then), and poisons cannot be charged because the effect is delayed until the next weapon hit and that doesn't fit in with the charged system.<BR>Never has it been said that Verant is against stacking or multiple charge poisons for balance or other reasons, just that it wasn't technically possible. Well, I had an idea that should work within the current game engine.<P>There are basically 80 poisons as far as I know (16 known effects at 5 strengths). The first thing to do would be to create 80 new items in the item database to represent a 5 charge version of each of the poison. Next add 80 new recipes to the poison making skill using the mortar and pestle. Each of these recipes would take 5 of the appropriate single charge poison that we already have and create the new 5 charge item. If an extra cost for the convenience of the 5 charge item is needed, maybe the sixth ingredient can be a new extra large poison vial for a couple of plat.<P>Each of the new items would be expendable and start out with 5 charges of a new spell that summons the original single charge poison. This would require 80 new spells in the spdat.eff file and would be the only sticky spot in my idea. Are we close to any limit in the spdat.eff file now?<P>In any case, by adding 80 new item table, 80 new recipes, and 80 new spells, poisons are now stackable. I believe these are all simple rows in a SQL (Oracle?) database somewhere. It doesn't seem like it would be too big of a project and it doesn't change the game engine at all, just the data.<P>The same process could be doubled in size to allow for 10 charge poisons, but that would require a new container, and I really don't want to have 2 containers for poison making.<P>---- END QUOTE ----<P>This idea only needs 80 new items and effects.<P>--- Geffin Dagrifter<BR>    Wealth Redistribution Engineer<BR>    Level 47, E'ci<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>*** Something similar may have been covered in previous posts, I don't have time to read through each one, sorry. ***<P>Regarding the Ragebringer quest, I think a couple of sutble changes need to made to this quest to make it more of an Epic Quest and less of an Epic Camp.<P>- Either have Eldreth up all the time, or make him a triggered spawn. There is no reason what so ever to force players to camp for up to 4 (real life) days, sitting doing nothing, waiting for him to spawn.<P>You can argue that this slows the rate of Ragebringers into the game, yes it does, but surely there is a less mind-numbing and blatently boring way to do this, for example:<P>- Swap the Vilinus the Small subquests around so that the items needed for the Stanos pouch (obtained at any time from Malka Rale rather than doing this long quest) result in the Jagged Diamond Dagger instead. Then make the Jagged Diamond Dagger a rare drop from Renux (similar to how the Cazic Quill is now a rare drop the the General), instead of having it drop every time along with the required quest item as it does now.<P>By doing this, those questing for the Ragebringer will still take a reasonably long time to complete the quest, but can actually have fun (surely not!) in the process by adventuring properly for items rather than sitting in the same place hour upon hour, day upon day, doing nothing at all.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>With a 44 rogue alt I have a few comments. My main being a 57 monk I compare the two and also know how rogues perform at higher lvls.<P>1. The hide/sneak through zones is a good idea. Makes no sense that rogues can not do this.<P>2. Disarm is flawed for all melee classes and should be fixed or discarded.<P>3. Bind wound can go up some since the rogue can't solo particularly well as is.<P>4. BS is fine and needs no adjustment imo. <P>5. Evade has to have some kind fo drawback to it. As it stands at higher lvls Rogues have immunity to mobs attacks. This just is not right. Thus, I am in favour of the chagnes to evade as you mentioned in your original post.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 8 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055114-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055114.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055114-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055114-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055114-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055114-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055114-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055114-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055114&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055114&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
