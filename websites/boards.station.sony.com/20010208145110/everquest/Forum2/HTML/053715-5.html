</FONT><HR>Aramalg wrote some _REALLY_ novel ideas. Too bad Alan made it _VERY_ clear that new spells are simply not in the mix.<P>The idea of being able to cast multiple images is an especially exciting idea to me. Unfortunately I can also see that it would be incredibly unbalancing.<P>The idea of spells that combine more than one type of damage is also of incredible interest to me, but don't we have another element that you left out? Commonly reffered to as electrical damage. Or is that considered fire element?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

They are one-dimensional and therefore should be able to nuke for 50% to 100% more than any other class.<P>As it is wizards are perhaps the least desirable class to group with.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This Class talk about balancing the classes but starting out with were not going to do anything drastic to the class because the are pretty much balanced. Bull!!!!<P>Besides how can anyone really review and get all the info from all these threads 1) if they are not here to read them becuase he's traveling and 2) there are so many and so much info that he is now skimming.<P>Essentially Verant messed up they have taken the casting classes and made them second "class" players in Velious. They broke the whole game and want to had everyone a cookie and have the change their whole view of their part in the game. Forget about the this class is better than mine crap and realize what everyone should be looking for is the casters to be able to assume their role of equal damage dealers in all encounters. Their should be no mob that is 100% resistant to all the spells a magic user can cast. There should be no mobe that have so many HP that casters can't kill in some way. <BR>OK so that means that they need to fix the casters so they have enough mana to be effective or have spells that do it. I realy feal that as a caster get higher and higher levels that they should use less mana in their spells anyway so they can cast more of the lower level ones. This would make the encounters last longer and also let the mele players do equal damage. This would also agro the mobs less on the caster. <P>I don't know about you all but I suffered through a tough time as a early player being a caster with the promise that I would be powerful later. (I died quite a few times at the early levels ).<BR>Fix the game Verant. IF the mobs have mega HP them we have to be able the deal out mega damage even if it's in small amounts and we need a way to keep the mobs off us while we do it. <P>I don't want another expansion or new content I want my level 51 character to be worth a crap no mater what the class.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I like the thought another person gave in a reply of a Form for wizards. Wizards have very low Hp/Ac and die quick. The creature form would allow us to turn into a creature and get faster mana regen but make us even more fragile (like that is possible) or it would increase damage or give us some cool ability.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>now besides not having any collision detection, and limited damage output another aspect that completely destroys class balance issues for wizard is this insane need for us to be in mellle range to cast on the big mobs. This rule is completey moronic, the whole idea of being a wizards is that  you give all your defense and in return you are get to blow up stuff from afar. There is no logic to creating a big gun that has no armor but has to be in point blank range to fire, hello thats completely idiotic. So my revise list of changes would be to fix the fundemental flaws which make wizard balance currently impossible then modifications to bring us in line with other classes.<P>1. fix the collision dectection, mobs should have just be able to ignore those big tanks in front of me( ever  rpg game im have ever played is balanced with the knowledge that the dms understand the basic laws of physics.<P>2 No more mellee range requirement to casting on big mobs, this is akin to creating a point blank range gun with no armor, makes absolutly no sense.<P>3. % of mana bar damage, critical and crippling blow on spells or more mana though i would prefer the ability to deliver a bigger payload that merely more of it.<P>4. I think that suggestion of hate based on actaully damage is a good idea, however if the game had actual collision dectection that wouldnt be such a big deal as it is now</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1) Turn the Al'Kabor line into a single target rain spell otherwise identical to the AE rains of the same level.<P>2) FIX the insanely complicated Concussion spell quest so that it doesn't require 2 full-blown 50+ level raids to do.<P>3) Harvest II.  We NEED it, or SOME way to replace lost mana since OOM wizard=ENTIRELY useless wizard since we have no alternate way of doing damage like magicians, and necromancers do.  No, enchanters cannot help after OOM either, but they have the clarity-line and long-lasting buff/debuff/crowd-control spells.<P>4) Critical spell hits.  PLEASE!  We are supposed to be the master of magical damage, so how about actually making it so?  Since warrior's crits work off of Dex, you could tie our criticals to stamina, since that is our secondary stat.<P>5) Velious mobs.  You are against the idea of a percent-based line of spells because that would make us unbalanced with the other classes.  How about instead of a spell, you just give us a harm-touch/lay-on-hands type ability that does so, and refreshes once a day?  Alternately, you could give us disciplines, so we could have one for each spell-category.  Example: At 51 we get Embrace of the Void(cold based), Heart of the Nova(fire based), and Wrath of the Arcane(magic based) - Each one low-resist, and they do 1% of the mob's total hit points at 51, increasing by 1%(or even 1/2%) per level.  ANOTHER idea goes back to the critical spell-hit.  Make our crits do a percent of the mob's current hit points instead of a numerical value.<P>6) Root-Enstill line needs to be looked at.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I do know this about wizards, the class was/is so unbalanced i DELETED a 36th level wiz on the Eci server, his name was Irramar. Magic resists were pathetic, 3 full resists on a green con &lt;------ common place. Full or no damage casts and the ensuing aggro from hell. Fade/yonder didn't work worth beans. Root/enstill were not any better, lasting maybe afew seconds at best IF they were not full resisted &lt;---- see aggro from hell. <P>On the plus side:<P>Damage ratios were about right. Being heavy guns was cool. 310 damage at 35th/36th.<P>The CT port was alil whacky.... even at 35th i would not port in unless i had a tank in group. But for what it was, i agree the port was good, and not to be changed.<P>All in all and from someone that has nothen to gain from being a wiz anymore.... Fix the resists, add time to the root/enstill and fix the aggro/hate from mob's to a wizard... I asked Verant so many times back then to do something but preached to the deaf...

</FONT><HR>ok the way i see it is this way.<BR>Give me a Self only MANNA REGEN spell because all our dammage comes from MANNA not swords, not knifes, not staffs, not by pets.  any wizard who weilds a weapon after level 20 is insane. so basically its like this.  us wizards need something done.  We are Masters of Damage, Key word Being MASTER... If we are Masters they why do i spend So much time on my Butt Medding because our Spells require so much doggone manna.  well the way i see it is this.. <BR>if a Necromancer can Kill 4 Mobs to my 1 mob in the same amount of time there is something very wrong with that.  I play my wizard now in Role Play because i cant get into GRPS if folks Know i am a wizard.. and i am SICK and TIRED of being a port *****.  now i play EQ for fun not to be a taxi and that is the only thing i am good for now<BR>oh yeah i can get to the planes to Big Whoop. ill never go there becaues i know it would take me forever to get my Bloody Corpse back if i was even lucky enough to get it.  Please for the Love of Mac-n-chees Fix our class i have seen just about every class get there upgrades and tuneups while i patiently waited on the sideline thinking we will be next or someday we will be heard, Well folks its that time.

</FONT><HR>Ok i decided to place my complaint where it should heh, Ok i play 52nd lvl wizzie and 90% of his life i've soloed &lt; maybe a little less&gt; Anyway i'm havin alot of downtime which is to be expected to some degree.I think we wizards need at least two more mana regen type spells possibly a Harvest 2 spell or an item that gives mana strictly for wizards. I mean you guys placed a robe that gives haste.Where in the world did that idea come from? That's basically pissin in the wind givin that to a caster.What am i gonna do use my trusty Dagger of Frost and attempt to stick and move a fire beetle? Sorry for the sarcasim but it's getting to the point where it's not funny anymore.Realize how sad it is that I can run OOM in Najena and have to run out and zone cause i have a lame 15th-20th lvl MoB kickin my backside.You guys need to realize we don't have pets and mana is our only means to survive period.We are the true casters in the game but yet we are very limited on our power do to the lack of mana regen.                                                                                            Did some lookin and realized that Necromancers get five and a half HP to Mana type spells their first one is at 8th lvl.Enchanters get three wizards get one and a half. I don't consider Manaskin much of a mana regen type spell and is why i say half. Mages get no kind of mana regen type spells &lt; which i think they should get at least one&gt; I'd have to say this is my biggest complaint as it's alot of my fella wizards too.                                                                                                                                                   Fella mentioned an idea about us bein able to possibly take on forms of lesser dragon types, I think is pretty descent idea that would give us wizards a change of pace and make it a little more exciting if not more roleplayable.                                                                                        As of now when youngers or even friends ask my opinion of the wizard class i don't speak highly at all about it,In a alot of ways i'm not seein how we're balanced with our rival casting cousins. Sure if i wanted a pet to protect me or fein death to save me i should have made a mage or necromancer and to be honest if i had a do over i would have chosen one of the other two. As of now i'm slowin down on playin the wizard as i am workin a mage up.  Anyway appreciate the listenin and hope somethin comes out of this                                                                    Thanks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

We are Masters of Damage, Key word Being MASTER... If we are Masters they why do i spend So much time on my Butt Medding because our Spells require so much doggone manna.  well the way i see it is this.. <BR>if a Necromancer can Kill 4 Mobs to my 1 mob in the same amount of time there is something very wrong with that.  I play my wizard now in Role Play because i cant get into GRPS if folks Know i am a wizard.. and i am SICK and TIRED of being a port *****.  now i play EQ for fun not to be a taxi and that is the only thing i am good for now<BR>oh yeah i can get to the planes to Big Whoop. ill never go there becaues i know it would take me forever to get my Bloody Corpse back if i was even lucky enough to get it.  Please for the Love of Mac-n-chees Fix our class i have seen just about every class get there upgrades and tuneups while i patiently waited on the sideline thinking we will be next or someday we will be heard, Well folks its that time.

</FONT><HR>I have a 57 wizard and think wizards are badly out of balance with the other caster because of the damage done by pets. I've seen mages kill mobs with their pets that would have killed me when low mana and never cast once. A way to balance wizards out would be to take the average damage of pets in a fight and add that much average damage to wizard spells. Also mana generation is far too slow for a class thats 100% dependant on mana. The only mana over time spell we get is manaskin and thats post 50. I know from much experience that wizards are a last ask for most groups because of the downtime and lack of shared buffs or a pet. The only time wizards are asked is for uber mobs in kunark and for ports. Bottom line is give faster mana regen and increase damage by 20% to 30% to even out the terrible imbalance of pets. Even though pets do more than 30% of a mages/enchanters/necros damage, that would be a start. Rant&lt; And why do druids with sow/nukes/heals/buffs get pets at 58ish and wizards get screwed with a joke pet. Please put your druid person on wizards. They might actually get a fair shake then.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Having a mage come close to or out damage us not counting their pet which is the equivilant of a comprable warrior is one of our biggest problems.  My suggestion to this is reduce mage nukes, and increase wizard nukes.  This should help.

SO the effect in the group would be that we could really up the taunt/hate factor on any one person we wanted, so that if the warrior was having a hard time pulling the monster off, we could make him really hated by having an area effect spell coming from him.<P>It seems like we would be liked in groups for that, and it would definitely NOT increase our personal ability to solo.<P>It is too late to give wizards damage shields (which in my opinion we should have gotten instead of Magicians), so maybe we can turn these otherwise unused spells into something neat, like the above.<P>Animated<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hey y'all.  Just thought I'd throw my 2 cents in on the Wizard tweaking issue.  I have a 12th level high elf wizard that I play exclusively on Fennin Ro.  After reading the issues that others have posted - my main concern regarding this class is their usefulness to a party/group.  I have found that some of my heavy hitting level 12 spells (shock of lightening, etc.) are a great benefit to a group but they are really not that useful when we are in a large battle with mutliple, tough MoBs.  The downtime to regenerate mana is the main problem.  I nuke a few enemies and then I'm out for almost the rest of the battle - watching my groups health diminish with no recourse.  I think that a nice solution to this problem has already been voiced - namely a spell, or line of spells, that allows for the wizard to summon a familiar.  Obviously this "pet" would have no melee or defensive functions (that would be intruding on the magician class) but instead, they would act as a kind of focus for the Wizard - offering faster mana regeneration, causing spells to require less mana, and perhaps adding power to a specific type of spell (i.e. fire-based, cold-based, lightening-based).  This also makes up for the fact that Wizards do not recieve any focus inventory items in the game that would serve to enhance our spell casting.  Another point to make, regarding the Wizard class in the fantasy genre overall, they almost are always depicted as having familiars - it is a staple in fantasy games, literature, and movies.  <P>I see the addition of a familiar line of spells to be the best solution (each type of familiar would have thier own unique properties and obviously there will only be one familiar at a time (the one pet rule)- that way Wizards wouldn't be able to have faster mana regeneration AND enhanced spells or another benefit at the same time - for balance purposes).<P>Just a thought!  But I have seen posts similar to this one - might be a good feature to add.<P>Jaxone<BR>12th Season High Elf Wizard  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

This would further the interdependence of Wizards and Enchanters and would have far less affect on soloing.  In the way a complete heal better benefits a Warrior because of his massive hit points, the enchanter's mana regeneration will better benefit the Wizard because of his great dependence on mana ALONE.

</FONT><HR>Derr Wrote:<BR>"I realy feal that as a caster get higher and higher levels that they should use less mana in their spells anyway so they can cast more of the lower level ones"<P>This is a really great point. You would think that one of the benefits to playing any class through to the higher levels would yield this type of result.<P>But, at least with wizards, this is not the case. In fact, it is just the opposite. Not only does it *not* take less mana to cast spells from spell circles far below your current level, resist rates increase, fizzles increase, interrupts increase, mana regen time lengthens, recast times lengthen. You just get increasingly clumsy as you get higher in level.<P>That is part of what is so frustrating. Ok, I lived with having to be level 4 before I could solo an orc pawn. I lived with not being able to participate with killing Avocets when I was Level 20ish - when all of my peers at the time could damage it. I currently live with the fact that if I'm ever going to get into a group I have to make all the effort to get into one (meaning, I'm never invited - I have to always ask).<P>So where are the fabulous rewards for being the weak feebling class when you finally manage to get to the higher levels?<P>Heck, lately at Level 41, when I cast my level 4 gate spell, I've been getting the message that my gate becomes unstable and collapses. Hmmmm, never had such a chronic problem with this when I was L20... you'd think by L41 I could cast my L4 gate running full speed and use zero mana.

</FONT><HR>I really thought the "mirror image" idea was nice. In thinking about it, it could help balance the aggro danger to the wiz if it worked as follows:<P>The wizard casts the mirror image before battle (much like the mage casts his pet) and then his perspective is changed to the mirror (like Eye of Zomm.) The wiz can then cast from his mirror while his body is sitting (perhaps medding to recover mana faster?) but cannot melee since it's just an image. The mirror image does the casting and when the monster decides to aggro, it will go after the image. The image would have a limited number of hit points, lets say something like a wizard of several levels below the caster (again much like a pet is several levels below the caster.) When the "image" is destroyed, if the monster is still aggro'ed on the wiz, it would come after him. The benefit to the wiz is a little bit of protection from a really upset target as well as a little bit of "remote viewing" which seems in line with the wizard description. This isn't really a "pet" since it does not act independently from the wiz, but does give some of the benefits.<P>Ok, here's another idea I had while reading through these posts. What about the idea of "hanging" spells. In other words, the wizard can pre-cast a specific spell (normal casting times, interupts, etc. apply) and "hang" it on himself or others just like a buff. The hanged spell can then be right clicked to be cast again immediately (or with very low cast time.) This would give wizards a way to have a saftey net (with evac and/or gates) that simply needs to be pre-planned. It would also be a way to "buff" other party members in a wizardly way.<P>Oh well, those are just some suggestions. I hope you're still out there reading, Absor.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I like this stamina idea - lets refine it a bit.<P>Stamina is a secondary trait for wizards so it even makes game logic sense !<P>A skill called focus that either converts stamina to mana. This would be tied into our stamina and thus our ability to endlessly do damage would be limited just like a warriors. Maybe instead of turning this into mana regen it could be a skill called bolt. Does damage based on your level - not much, but low resist, and it sucks stamina from the caster. Now a wizard is only helpless if mana AND stamina are spent, similar to a warrior who is low on health and stamina.<P>Actually you could have a whole slew of such skills to go along with meditation, channeling and specialisation.<P>Focus - greater damage<BR>Penetration - lower resists<BR>Extend - greater range<P>Maybe our answer lies in such skills and not in mana (heresy). Think about it though, if you just add more mana it affects everything in game fr us and it will become hard to balance.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

That would pretty much level out the damage/mana problems at lower levels, and would place our magic at a more appropriate level with regard to other classes. <BR>Also, I think we should have some sort of a debuff spell to bring mob MR down some. All other pure int clases have these spells, and it's even more valuable to us being 100% mana dependant.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>                       *** SOME ACTUAL IDEAS! ***<BR>I am trying to include some actual ideas, not complaints, and hopefully somethings that can actually be implemented without rewriting all of EQ!<P>Trying to think of a way to balance the wizard and remain within guidelines of the EQ Engine..  It's not an easy task...  Currently there is nothing outstanding about us wizards.  My opinion to help us balance out should be within programming restrictions.  I hate the idea to suggest this, but I fear it's the only viable solution.  <P>More nukes??   Less mana for a nuke???  All that equals more casting and more bumps to a mobs agro list!!  AND That only makes us more powerful soloers.  I'm against both those ideas as being a primary solution.<P>First off, most "similar" classes share some components... What I mean is along the lines of a Shaman and a Druid both casting a signature spell... SOW.   Now enchanters are incredible at crowd control and mob de-buffing, which is fair, but a form of clarity should be available to a wizard.  If not clarity a mana regen similar that does not affect the physical being of the wizard.. If I think of a grand idea I'll post that.<P>Next, we really should be able to dish out some serious damage without instantly pulling the mob off our tank.  And we certainly should be useful from the beginning to the end of a fight.  Some form of a DoT should be available to us for every fight.  Now the difference should come from possible an AoE DoT or (my preference would be) a DoT that is a Tashani/Malice Debuff combined with a damage component.  ---This means we can hurt the mob up front without pulling it and we can use our magic more effectively when we need it as well.   With this, however, we have to look at what to base the damage or debuff off of, and I would like to suggest the specialization of the wizard.  So if I cast this spell on a mob and I am a specialized(mastered) in Evocation, the DoT will start hurting the mob and my next spell using that specialization (evocation) will hit harder or full.  I would really like to see that line of spells (if implemented) start around level 30 and move on to become a very deadly factor.<P>Finally, since we don't get pets and we don't have a great swinging arm, I would like a spell that's cast time and success are ~about~ equivalent to a shadow knight casting Feign Death.  I would like this spell to act as an adrenaline rush... Not invincibility like a cleric's Divine Aura, but more like a magical form of a warrior's death berzerk.  I don't know what stat it would raise, but it would allow us to maybe land a more efficient blow while it's on with a percent increase. <P>      For example, it's the middle of the fight, I know my melee'ers aren't going to make it.  I cast this spell and it's a success.. I have a flashing icon going to stand for approx 30 - 45 seconds (enough for 3-5 casts max).  I cast Ice Shock (normal hit of 310 dmg and medium resists to equal level mob) the spell has an increased chance of landing, and does 310 + (level/1.5 )%.  So at level 35 it would hit for 310+(35/1.5)% = 384dmg.  and at 4 extra casts equals 296 dmg or &lt;~ALMOST~&gt; an extra cast.<P>I'd love to hear some feedback on these suggestions when any of you read this</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Fellow wizards: I am impressed with what I have seen from you guys. Keep up the good work, I know positive changes are going to come from this, and all our hard work and lobbying will not be for naught. <P>Class Balance Issue: Wizards vs. Greenies<P>Last night I was in Paineel harvesting bonechips with my little brother, he a lvl 34 paladin, I a 51 wizard. We spent 3 hours collecting them so he could up his faction with the Cleric Guild of Kaladim. He required kindly faction so that he could do the soil of underfoot part of his armor of Ro quest. <P>After 3 hours, the results were: Him: 250 bonchips, me: 85. <P>I ask you: does this seem balanced? I had my lvl 8 ice nuke up, and while it was one hit, one kill, the restrictive cast time, and immobility rendered my capabilities nearly useless in this endeavor. It isnt like I am going to chase after the skeletons with my 100 delay staff of the wheel. <P>After making such a pointed statement at wizards (no melee for you, here: use this 100 delay staff) it seems only fair that Verant enable us to be as good at killing off the greenies as melee types  our level! <P>My suggestion: a nuke-the-greenie type spell that is low delay, low mana cost, low damage available at different points in our careers.  They would also have little knockback effects, as well as minor stuns so that we can slowly back up, cast again, back up, cast again and possibly get off a root if we need to. Levels 20, 34, and perhaps 51 would be a good spread for these spells to be entering the game.  I would also like to see these things have resists like lures (to offset the multiple resists a dd + stun spell receives). It totally sucks when a greenie aggros and then your roots dont stick and then you get the loading: please wait screen. I mean come on, were wizards, were not supposed to be completely helpless. <P>Examples: <P>Name: Solists Greenie Nuker<BR>Level: 20<BR>Mana Cost:  20<BR>Damage: 40 + 1 second stun <BR>Recast time: Instant<BR>Delay: 1.0 seconds<BR>Type: Ice<P>Name: Druzzils Diminutive Damager<BR>Level: 34<BR>Mana Cost: 34<BR>Damage: 68 + 2 second stun <BR>Recast time: Instant<BR>Delay: 1.0 Seconds<BR>Type: Magic <P>Name: Tallons Tiny Toaster<BR>Level: 51<BR>Mana: 51<BR>Damage: 102 + 3 second stun <BR>Recast time: instant<BR>Delay: 1.0 seconds<BR>Type: Fire<P>p.s. not to rehash points already made but: 1) i like the familiar idea 2) i don't understand why we wizards are sooo vulnerable to dots, someone suggested a dot shield, very good idea 3) I really like the anti-summoning spell 4) i also like the group harvest idea, 5) Caster disciplines: we need them and i know i saw some great ones at www.graffe.com, I'll go look them up and put them here so that Absor doesn't have to look all over for them. <P>Guys, the easier we make this for verant, the more likely we're going to see positive changes. <P>-Sawz<BR>51 Channeler of the SP</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Firstly a message to both sides of the table:<P>Wizards: A few of you need to calm down, just put your suggestions forward with no flaming.<P>Absor: Forgive the wizards who get a little excited Im sure they dont mean to flame you personally, its just when we rolled a wizard we all expected a lot more, especially in the later levels.<P>So far the main problems are Group Contribution, Port locations, and Misc items (Concussion spell etc) I personally care little about any of them except the group thing.<P>Group Ideas:<P>1)Faster mana regen while grouped, scaled up like the new group exp bonus. This would not make soloing any more effective, which VI seems to have a problem with. <P>2)Group Harvest, maybe this would step on Enchanters but worth a look at.<P>3)Mana efficiency buff. Cast on other casters to make them have a chance of using less mana per spell. Like an extra specialisation bonus.<P>4)Some sort of wall/dome of fire/lighting seen this in other games, would look so cool.<P>5)Mob Evac. Given that Wizards have evacs as a sort emergency panic button, this would be more useful and send all mobs back to their spawn point and have no aggro, like camping out/in. Agreed this is a powerful spell so could have a very long recast time like Harmtouch or something.<P>6)General enhancement to our DD spells, they are currently only around 10% better than Druids and Miagicians, this is pathetic. A Clerics healing spells are much better than their nearest rivals.<P>7)Int cap raised from 200 to say 250 just for wizards, arent we supposed to be the class brain?<P>8)And finally yes, where for the love of god are our pointy hats?<P>If these seem a little crazy, thats because playing a Wizard can unhinge you<BR>Level 51 Wizard<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Okay, figured out how fast a lvl 60 wizard could do dmg vs a lvl 60 rogue until the wizard was oom. Wizard has 3135mana in this example.<P>A lvl 60 wizard chain blasting I figured could get off 9 draughts of ice(3 seconds each with 2.5 recovery time) and 4 ice spears of the solists(4 seconds each with 13 second recovery).  You do ice spear and then 3 draughts and then ice spear again so the recovery time is basically 2.5 the whole way.  Total is 11374dmg.  Time: 75.5 seconds<P>A rogue does 9060dmg in 75.5 seconds.  Takes another 20 seconds for a rogue to outdamage us.<P>Medding at 50mana/tick(meditate(21/tick), epic(3/tick), c2(11/tick), harvest(3/tick), 55+ bard song(12/tick)) it take 6 minutes and 29 seconds(377 seconds) to med to full mana.  In that time the rogue has done 45240dmg.<P>54300dmg vs 11374dmg every 8 minutes(452 seconds exactly). 4.77 lvl 60 wizards(with epics and 55+ bards) to equal a rogue.<P>Those are under ideal...perfect conditions...no resists...no fizzles...no interrupts.  Wizard has his epic, is grouped with a 55+ bard, and enchanter.<P>The 120dmg/sec figure comes from an uberguild rogue on my server and is realistic.  The 25dmg/sec figure for the wizard is artificial and will never be achieved.<P>A wizard is blown away in damage Absor.  I can't say it in many other ways.  I've looked at the numbers.  I've put the wizard in the best case scenario every time and it STILL doesn't help.  <P>So a regular non uber rogue won't do 120dmg/sec...well...an uber wizard won't do 25dmg/sec either(aside from right click items).  I have grouped with a 55+ bard...once.  I don't have my epic and I rarely have manaskin on.  My mana regen is around 35mana/tick which means it takes me 8 and a half minutes to med up to full(500 seconds).  A rogue at my level(lvl 56) and with his epic does 70dmg/sec.<P>40005dmg vs 8684dmg(in 571.5 seconds - 71.5 to cast my spells).  Takes 4.6 lvl 56 wizards under normal circumstances to equal 1 lvl 56 rogue.<P>In the time it takes for me to do 8684dmg from chain casting the rogue does 5126dmg.  Means it takes the rogue an extra minute to surpass me in damage.<P>Again...all of my examples don't favor wizards.  They don't take into account resists, interrupts, summons, and fizzles.  In the first example I went so far as to put the wizard in the ideal group with the ideal equipment.<P>In both examples the wizard falls WAY short of being of any use to an exp group.<P>If we can't get wizards to be the masters of magical damage then the class needs to be reworked entirely.<P>Giving us the bone of 2% dmg of an epic mob is not enough.  We still have to address the fact that wizards are not useful in exp groups.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 9 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053715&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053715&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
