</FONT><HR>Kheldan,<P>I'm not sure I understand your point.  The economics in Ultima Online were completely different (and far more dynamic and interesting) than everquest economics.  In Ultima Online, you didn't have "uber" items.  Armor and weaponry was disposable, and because of how easy it was to die from a pk gank people did not go out with the few uber items they had.  The only time I'd bring out a bow of vanquishing was during the 30 minutes before the servers were taken down.  Ultima Online economics revolved around money and land.  That's why the game was remarkable.  You could own houses of various types, sell anything and everything on vendors.  Hold events in your home, decorate, and train etc...  <P>And that's how it should be.  You could play the game how you wanted to play it.  What can you do but camp spawns hours on end in everquest?  Trade skills?  Compare the usefulness of alchemy in everquest and in Ultima Online.  No comparison.<P>Nerfing was a big problem in UO too.  They made PK'ing way too hard, increased the penalties for killing way too much.  Problems with bugs plagued the game for a long time, house break-ins etc...  But the principle of not making the game driven by items paid off by allowing the player to BREATHE once in a while and take a break from farming spawns. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just look at one of the latest polls on this very site if you want further proof that the devs are out of touch with the majority of the player base. <BR>It went something like this, can't remember exactly.<P>What is most important to you, the player?<P>Being first.<BR>Being the Best.<BR>Being ...<BR>Being ...<P>I can't remember the others. I do remember that no where in this poll did they think to put the option "TO JUST HAVE FUN!!" and that says a lot to me about their mentality.<P>Hey, I'll be the first to admit that I was a hard core power gamer when EQ first came out. That hasn't been the case for me after about 7-8 months into commercial release. I had to return to reality.<P>Time is the ruling factor in EQ. If you had the time (talking 6+ hour sessions) and you were lucky enough to explore things first then you reaped substantial rewards. Now I play with my wife and we do so for maybe a couple hours a couple of nights a week. However, we can also go a couple weeks straight without ever logging on.<P>If we don't have something planned for the weekend we may jump on and have a good six hour gaming session. This is when we usually are able to have the most fun and feel like we actually made some level progress.<P>Most of our friends no longer play and those we make in game now soon pass us by because we don't play 4-7 days a week. So now it's mostly pick up groups which can be a horrible experience and complete waste of time more times than not.That's not fun.<P>We actully are some of the few types that have fun running our own mini-quests for newbies (real newbies are hard to find now). We've been known to give out really nice/rare equipment for just having a player spend a little time role playing with us. But this is coming to an end because we don't have the time to get those spare items anymore.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

There is no way VI can keep up with their abilities--eventually they will run out of content and these uber-elites will move on to another game.

</FONT><HR>I've been playing EQ since it's release in the UK nearly 2 years ago, and over time I've seen a steady lean in the game to the post 50 levels, now in some ways this isn't bad and in some it is, I don't have a 50+ character, but I have plenty of friends that do, and their one big complaint is that YOU have to be in large groups to get to some area's in the game, and to be honest they don't like it, as the 'uber guilds' get more uber, the smaller guilds get shut out.<P>Not by the uber guilds, but by the game it's self, lol classic Capatilism (sic) the rich get richer and the poorer get poorer. Now I'm lucky I have good equipment, most of which is handme downs from higher lev friends, what the game really needs are some area's that are restricted to UNDER a certain level, if they can make the planes restricted to 45+ why can't they do the reverse? <P>Also how about actually duplicating dungeons? i.e. 2 Sol B's or 2 KC's and the such, this would both make it better for people to hunt for items and would also kill some of the overcrowding (Asheron's Call has used this to great effect from what I can see) makes sense to me that poeple want these items so why the hell not make them more available and cut this bull about risk vs reward, the uber guilds are in NO risk when getting some of the better items in the game, why not cut some of the smaller guilds and lower levels a bit of slack and make the game more open and appealing to them. All I see now are people racing to get to lev 50+ and missing out on the fact that the game is meant to be fun, not just fun for the 50+.<P>My 2 cents<P>Griselgrump of Emarr<BR>lev 39 Paladin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Part of the problem is that this game inherently requires zero skill.  Items and levels win.  Tactics are often secondary.  A good strategy can provide a win instead of a loss WITH good uber items but a good strategy is futile with average items.<P>Perhaps we need to see an aim driven rpg soon where accuracy/dodging is implemented to differentiate the good players from the average ones.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Very well said Bogmog.<P>lord_bhaal : In my mind I don't believe Bogmog's post is anything close to a whine.  It's a conscise write up of what is occuring on the servers at this time.  You won't see that as you have stated your highest level character is level 19, which is far removed from the 46+ game.  True, the unique items in EQ are one of the cool things about the game, I won't deny that.  Bogmog is not desputing that either, what he is trying to say (I think at least) is what it *takes* to get those unique items.  The groups, players, strategies, items so on and so forth is wrong.  The trend he describes I'm sure is taking place on most, if not all servers.<P>In the end, the changes that need to be made will probably never happen.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to be a pessimist ... but changes of this nature I'm sure would require complete re-balancing and building.

</FONT><HR>I think Verant already pushed eq to a point of no return. The very believe of good stuff have to rare is the key here.  There is a big different between rare drop and rarely killed here.  When a mob is hard to kill but not like what it is now, at same time, the mob will only carry certain high lvl items but rarely the super high lvl items, then it is good balance.  People can go kill dragons/Gods, get some really good loot, but if they lucky they can get a super item.  Make this super item drop rate like 1 in 10 to 1 in 15 for example. Increase the mob spawn rate to every 2 days.  This way players can have fun killing big bosses all the time, players don't really need the godly items to have fun.  Do you know why this game is a powerlvler's game?  It is because, players need spent huge about of time to lvl, camp, and killing before they can start to experience the entire game.  For most of the other players, they can only experience maybe 60% of the game at most.  Guess what, at the end, those who experienced everything will quit, and those who can only experience 60% of the game will quit.  Only people left, would be the 30% of people who almost got the uberness(no such word) but far above more than 50% of players in game.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree with most of what the original poster says. A very small percentage of the player population belongs to the uber guilds that are able to regualarly raid and farm out the newest items. I have nothing against uber guilds, but VI cetainly has to remember that they are the minority of the players. <P>Something I really dont understand is why VI has placed certain quest items on NPC's that *had* long since become ignored by these guilds. The addition of the quest item in the loot table makes the NPCs once again the realm of the uber guild.<P>Having said all that, VI NEEDS uber guilds. Its these players, with their shiny new toys, that drive the majority of players to continue playing and hope that one day they will have those items.<P>One has to remember, the game was designed to push you to the next zone, then the next, then the next. The quest for the best stuff and the next level, drives players to these zones. It drives level 50+ to Kunark and Velious. I have spent very little time in Kunark. The VS faction is just, well.. idiotic. I dont have Velious and never plan to buy it. I simply dont have the time to play in these zones. I dont have the time to work on FV faction for weeks so I can join groups in negative VS faction zones.<P>I'd like to say, newer players have it much easier in their lower levels than those who started characters a year ago. There ARE more items available to them, it IS safer to travel and there are dozens of well made spoiler sites out there for them to explore BEFORE they explore.<P>I remember seeing a level 23 dark elf cleric in full bronze and thinking how totally decked out he was. He told of a far off house across the ocean where small bronze armor dropped... I just dont know if its the same experience for new players now. The lands of EQ were still new and felt unexplored. I made it to unrest, I knew one day I'd make it to that house and wear bronze. I have no such expectations about Kunark or Velious armor.<P>Overall, I dont know exactly what I'm saying here  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">. In one hand it *IS* the uber guilds that lead the way. They are the ones mapping the zones, they are the ones trying to one-up each other by posting information to spoiler sites or their own web sites. Its also the uber guilds which get items nerf'd, which get mobs made more difficult as VI scrambles to 'balance' certain zones. But they are balancing the zones with the uber guild in mind and not the players who will come after.<P>Nazershar Adaro<BR>51st Spire of Hate<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Even if they make it so POH gear spawns laying on the ground the people who can devote more time to the game will have more stuff then you.  EQ is not about skill, guilds, or classes it is all about time.  Those that can spend it and those who cannot.  How Verant keeps you playing is the desire to get that item.
