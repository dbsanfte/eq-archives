&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>As 51 lvl enchanter, I am just becoming acquainted to the "end-game" scenario that many Enchanters have mentioned in previous posts.  Since this post is about balancing issues, let me direct your attention to the issue of balancing the enchanter class thru the entire life of the class.<P>I don't think I'm alone (atleast amoung enchanter character players) in thinking that the Enchanter plays the most pivotal role of all within the game, even exceeding the healing role of clerics in a group.  My reason for this is that a good enchanter enables the group to take on five mobs which would require three clerics in a group to keep the tanks (and clerics) alive.  A poor enchanter will get the entire group killed.  If Verant had designed the game to limit encounters to one or two mobs, the enchanters role would be much less pivotal.  This is water under the bridge because multiple mob encounters provide the greatest feeling of danger and thus the greatest enjoyment in the game.<P>I'll be the first to admit that I feel that the enchanter is TOO powerful in many situations especially in the middle level (20-45).  However, in the higher levels, the enchanter (along with alot of other casters) has been relegated to the background.  This is not necessarily a bad thing yet the WAY it has been done (giving mobs MR or Mez immunity, increasing mob hps to the point at which dozens of ice comets can't kill it) not only ruins the enjoyment many long standing enchanters had, but demonstrates that Verant needs to examine balance of each class within level bands.<P>Increasing the MR of mobs to our spells in SoV is not necessarily bad.  I've been amazed at the fact that my mezzing is not resisted better by mobs in Kunark and the original game areas.  However, if you are looking for balance, it is NOT achieved by making one whole portion of the game useless to our class.  If you were looking to increase the challenge of mobs to groups having enchanters, you should increase the MR to mobs throughout the entire game to a level where it becomes a challenge (though not the ridiculousness that SoV is designed to).<P>As far as the illusions go, I frankly am tired of the whole deal.  I don't necessarily want any more illusions but I think the excuses that Verant has given then found out to be not truthful reflects pretty badly on your decisionmaking.<P>Our debuffing ability of mobs is pretty ridiculous as it appears that the mobs have unlimited stats such that our spells have no apparent affect.  While it may be useful in PvP, Verant has made clear that the enchanter class is never going to be balanced in PvP by the way your have handled PvP issues with enchanter spells. The previously posted suggestion of debuffing by percentages sounds useful since that is the way the attack speed buffs and debuffs work.<P>I find it decidely unbalanced the lack of reasonable enchanter-only equipment that can be obtained at the mid-levels (ie prior to becoming planes capable) when compared to every other class in the game.  There are three classes that get beat on the most:  warrior (taunt), cleric (healing), and enchanter (Tash, Mezz).  The AC granting spells that Enchanters receive do not compensate them in a balanced way for the increased AC that each of these other classes can achieve at these levels from farming equipment.<P>Aanny Crowdteaser<BR>51 Enchanter (Luclin)  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Very good posts above. I'm impressed.<P>The only thing I would add is to keep Enchanters unique. I don't see much being given to Enchanters in the final tunings and I don't have a big problem with that other than with Velious. Seems like the recent spell additions are tending to blur class distinctions. Please don't give away our core abilities, mezzing in particular, to other classes and dilute the Enchanter class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok.. I play an Enchanter, currently level 13, and this is my first character.<P>He's not agnostic, this means that running into places makes things.. interesting. (With Illusion: Dark Elf, and Alliance up, I'm STILL KoS to the guards in Neriak.)  Could the Illusions also remove the god factions on Enchanters, and place just base faction?  It does seem odd that the guards see me as a Dark elf who worships one of the good gods...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Most of my concerns have been expressed above. The ineffectiveness of the Lull series, the weaken & incapictate series. The high mr and liberal use of the no-mezz, no-stun flag reducing us to buff dispensers only in some of the high level game.<P>Illusion wisp: Even if wisps aren't in the global, there must be room for them. They're what, 3 polys? Make it level 49 and have it's secondary effects be: levitation (like  air elemental illusion does) and endure magic.<P>Why are INT casters punished with Research? <P>Wis casters get all their spells with one trip to their guild, why can't we? I just dinged 44, I've been auctioning for Nitilim's pages for 3 levels now and still don't have the necessary pages for my slow upgrade (or any other 44 research spell for that matter). It pisses me off that shamans can just wander into their guild and buy theirs. Slow is just as critical to enchanters as it is to shaman. Yeah it's pure class envy, but there it is.<P>Incandescent gloves, mid 20's Temple of Sol Ro quest, have +3 mana on them. Are you sure that wasn't supposed to be +3 Int?  I mean, c'mon, three mana? <P>I want to be able to enchant more stuff, go kick Yakatizma and make him design more worthwhile tradeskill items for us to magic up. <P>Enchanters with religion should also to be able to imbue gems, not just clerics/shamans/druids. I'm not sure if the spell system can accept scribing of spells with a religious restriction though. Hopefully my mistake in picking a religion will have at least one minor good point. <P>And please, just fess up on just how charisma effects chance to mez, chance to charm, duration of charm. If it actually effects those things at all that is. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have an idea that could solve the enchanter illusion wants with a single new spell. A copy cat spell that doesn’t copy NPCs but PCs. This spell would copy the target PC’s race, equipment and face. Basically copy exactly how the other player looks…nothing else. I think it would be a neat spell for enchanters and finally deem them true masters of illusion (and I think most enchanters want more illusions). And the fact is they could use at least one more past level 44. Please Please consider or add your opinion to this idea.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Most of what I've seen here has been right on the mark.  One thing I'd like to add that I haven't seen yet is they qyenos enchanter guild hall dose not have tiny daggers.  I belive the merchent who should have them has something strange in its place (it's been a while since I've looked not sure what it is).  Just something you might want to look into.<P>Second if you'd like to get a real good feel for enchanters through out our life span Eugii (a very well respected enchanter across many servers) has a very good site.  It gives a spell by spell analysis and tells ya whats good and whats bad. http://members.tripod.com/Eugii/ is the link.  Check it out if you have time it's also something that was written before your request and thus may be a little more objective then some of the posts on this board.<P>Finally about the str debuffs..the main problem seems to be mobs don't cary anything on them.  Debuffing a mob who carries a few rusty weapons dose have a large effect (the guards in WC are a great example of this you can drop most of there hits from 50+ to teens and single didgets).  However a mob that is carrying only a few pounds of gear (some coin) just isn't going to be encumbered no matter how much str you take away.  If you tossed out weapons to more critters you'd probably see more people useing the str debuffs.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I like the idea of combining the c2 with gift of brillance, one problem may be the casting cost though. Since C2 costs 115 for 35 mins, I'd want the new combination spell to last about 2-2.5 hours in order to balance the mana cost. The idea here being the lvl 60 spell is better. If you are the only enchanter at an event, it would be close to impossible to keep everyone up with c2/gift at the present cost. Or lower the spells cost to that of c2 and keep the time where it is as it stands atm (maybe a group version?) And maybe increase its mana regen to be at least half of Potg.<P>Some have mentioned that they would like to see the rapture and dictate have a lure like ability associated with them. I agree to a point, one thing that lures do though is allow a wizard to hit an uber mob (trak, VS, Zlandicar, etc) And to have rapture hit these mobs is not in the spirit of the game. So i make the following suggestion. Add a tash like effect to the spell that is checked first before the spell lands. Perhaps something like -200 mr, and it lasts only the duration of the spell (dictate or rapture). It was very disheartening to see a flat out resist on the spell when cast upon a lvl 55 mob, it shouldnt happen (the mob was not giant flagged either)<P>I would like to see an AE dispell type of spell, perhaps a AE recant that wouldnt hit teamates (much like our stuns, unless on a PvP server).<BR>An improved manasieve spell would be a nice addition, the old one is a bit dated for the mobs we are attacking at higher lvls now. A charm in the middle of dictate (lvl 60) and boltrans (lvl 53) with a bit of a higher cap but same danger as Boltrans. I had an idea for a spell called "insanity" where the target would randomly continue to attack its target, or itself, depending upon the role, it would be dot like and last for a fixed amount of time.<P>%t has gone insane!<BR>%t has hit himself for # of dmg!<P>Ya i know, pipe dream, but thats the point of this thread right? =)<P>If you could take a look into casting times and the effects, i think we would appreciate that on a whole. Some of the recast times are mind boggling, almost seem to be there to intentionally waste time (Visions of granduer, or any buff in general). Casting time is fine, but a long recast time? Keep in mind im talking about buffs and not dmg spells or dots, so non combat situations.<P>Some of the newer items also have curious cast times. For example the crystal wand and crown of confusion. I believe they have a cast time of about 8-10 secs, the original spells have times of about 1 sec to 1.5 seconds, and there use was to be thrown in as a fast way to interupt a caster, or to regain contraol of a situation etc. But in its currect form, no one can stop a caster from casting in 8-10 secs let alone stun your way out of 5 mobs hitting you at the same time. This should be looked into, across the board for all classes (any right clickable item)<P>On a slightly dif topic, but one that goes back to balance, could you tell me why a certain class has the opportunity to raise its ac much higher than the rest of its int casting brothers? (Necros) One item that they can wear provides 28 ac on the chest. I would like to see all int caster havea shot at these types of items. By no means do i want those items taken away from the necro class, i would just like to see some balance across the board (IMO enchanters get hit more than any other int caster class)<P>Thanks for your time, and i look forward to your thoughts and feelings on our issues.<P>Twing the Phantasmist<BR>Druzzil Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I like Twyl's ideas; I'd just like to comment on a few of them  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Illusion small/big could be pretty much implemented as self-only shrink/grow, and would be nice for folks who like to look like trolls  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> It doesn't seem that unreasonable to me that someone capable of looking like a troll or a gnome could look like a troll the size of a gnome... this would probably be around level 24, by which time we've got all the races...<P>Illusion monster: The insta-kos idea would nicely handle 2 things: one, the coding would be much simpler than doing per-form faction, and two, there would be no worries of folks using the form to reduce risks in a dangerous area. These also, though, address the two biggest problems I remember hearing with Illusion: target... so what I'd love is illusion: target, that makes me kos. You can have it not work on things that, say, summon monster can't get (so no gods etc  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Major illusion: I like this one just for adding more things to look like, though I don't see any need for it to stack, really. The other items that should go with it are already stacking; this on Illusion Troll just doesn't seem right  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Illusion armor: *drool* I like this idea a lot. Doesn't seem like it should be too hard; the server already has to know to lie to other players' clients; now it just lies about the equipment too. And in the spirit of illusions having effects that we already have spells for, this could include the Shielding line. Illusion leather could get Lesser (probably at the level we get Shielding as a spell); chain gets Shielding; Plate gets Greater (maybe this could be split into Bronze for shielding and Steel for major?)<P>On another note, the idea someone had for a specialized attack pet like the cleric pet makes great sense to me as a way to give chanters something to do on the big nasties that resist everything else. Since it's purely attack, dual wielding from the getgo is good; it doesn't need the shield for defense because we don't care about its defense.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>My concerns.<P>1. Our Pets. While I doubt this gets very far, this has been my biggest gripe for a while. Verant has said numerous times that we are not a pet class, but how many non-pet classes get a pet at every spell level? Even non pet classes (shaman, druids) now have commandable pets that can and will kick our pet's arse. That being said our pets need some tweaking in the HP arena. Make them at least on par w/ the necro pets for Level/HP/Damage. And for sake of my sanity quit saying we are not a pet class. Granted we don't use our pets as often, because of CC issues, but there are times we could on single spawn pulls. This would also serve to give us something to do in Velious besides being buff monkeys. At least I would feel I was contributing.<P>2. Charm. I still do not understand why the masters of the mind can not charm a MoB and not have it attack after charm breaks. If we can convince a MoB to do our bidding, it would stand to reason that we could also cause him to forget that we even forced him to do our will. After all we have the ability to make mobs forget us now, just put it in the charm spell so that when it breaks the forget about us.<P>3. Illusions. I use a handful of them on a daily basis, Air is by far the one I use most. I use the racials when traveling in hostile towns. And use water whenever I think I may be in water. I don't need any more. Would be nice to individual cast on others, but I don't know if I would really want that. Would have to many people begging to be turned into X.<P>4. Tashan Line. Make it so it does a PERCENTAGE MR debuff. It would be a lot more useful and at higher levels would serve to alleviate the much higher MR on Velious MOBS.  <P>5. WTYH. This spell line needs a LOT of work. I never really understood why it got hit with the nerfstick. AFter all there are plenty of other classes that can stun the mob and not have it fight back, for that matter we can pretty much lock down multiple mobs for probably 98-99% of the time w/ our color series. <P>6. Mesmerise. Fix them so higher versions of the line overwrite the lower one, and if they are they same version let them overwrite. If you got to enchanters in a group at least they can cover each other when the 'sheet' hits the fan. Entrance should overwrite Entrance REGARDLESS of the casters level. And Entrance should overwrite Mesmerise PERIOD! I would like to see the single target versions of Mes overwrite the group version of lower level as well, but that may be asking a bit much.<P>7. Buffs. In general I don't mind buffing, what I would like to see happen is that the 'Gift' serious changed to allow buffs to last longer on said target. So that Gift of Magic would have a 25% increase in duration on ALL buffs. The other 2 would be 50% and 75% respectively. <P>8. Enchanting. Either let us enchant items other than jewelcrafting or change the Thicken Mana serious completely to something more beneficial. Let us those spells to cast on other players to slow down their mana burn. Honestly when I first heard of these spells that is what I assumed they did. So assuming Thicken Mana cast on a player his spells would cost 25% less to cast mana wise. You get the idea....<P>Well that is about it for my peeves.<P>Amar<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Ok, heh I'll give it my two cents as well.<BR>All in all, I think Enchanters are pretty well balanced, after toughing it out through 52 now almost 53 levels, I feel I've got a good grip what is going on.  Some stuff I've researched from higher level enchanters, some is my own personal experience.  I'm going to focus on spells, one bug (I know, I know=) and some ideas that seemed to have got some popularity amongst the people I've talked to with it.<P><BR>Spells:<BR>-Glamour of Kintaz (Going off of conversations):  Pretty decent resist rates, and very useful.  The only downfall here is the mana cost for the spell; which I believe is 275.  From what I've heard, and seen my friends and I came up with a few ideas.  A) Lower the mana cost to around 200, and give it a resist rate a little better than Dazzle. (When I say this, I mean when Dazzle can be used) or the alternative.  Up the resist rate a lot more on the spell.  Maybe give it only a level check, and take the magic resist aspect out of the equation.  That's a possibility that a lot of people liked, althouhg I dunno if it'd be an allowed one =)<BR>Lull Series:  *Begins to beat the dead horse*  Heh, ok when I hit 51, I thought Wake of Tranquility would be different than the previous spells.  A harmony that works indoors *drool*.  Well, after CR, I finally came to terms with the usefulness of the spell.  I can see this spell being a huge overpowering item, but as it is, it's delegated to the back of my book.  The resist rates are pretty high, even on stuff that was lvl 25 =).  Suggestions?:  To be honest, I don't have a great one, because I can't think of a way to make this spell better, without making it a major balancing issue.  My best guess would be, either A) make the resists no aggro, so when it does eventually stick, we don't have the whole camp coming down on us.  B) Make it a lvl check, with no MR needed.  These are not great suggestions, but maybe they'll spawn something that'll make the spell a bit more usefull.<BR>Charm (Boltran's and Dictate):  Ok, really only have one issue with Boltran's (Lvl 53 charm spell).  As enchanters get higher, cons all blur together and become blue.  What would helps us out a lot?  A message that tells us it is too high too charm, right off the cast.  Like Theft of Thought and the no mana message.  It's not the fact that the mobs are too high, it's that we just blew a lot of mana to see that annoying red message come up =).  The other alternative is make a charm upgrade for, oh lvl 55 or 56.  So that way, we have something to hold us over until Dictate.  IMO, having the "This creature is too high to charm" message right off the bat would probably be the best idea.  -Dictate- Now, this is going off of pure talking, and interviews with other enchanters, so if anyone has any better insight, please by all means share =).  But the spell sis pretty good, the only qulams (if you'd call them that), is the duration/recast time.  Now everyone I've talked to said they'd love to see either A) The recast time knocked down by a minute or two or B) Up the duration by a few seconds.  I can see this being a very fickle area, because it is a neigh-resitable spell.<P>A single Target Stun for pre-50: I think this would be a really good idea.  There were times when I wish I didn't have to rely on the AE one, because I'm in a close tight area.  I think this would be a great addition to any enchanters spell book pre-50.<P>Torment of Argli:  Ok, this is my radical idea of the post.  And it seems like a nifty one, and got the "ooohhhh good idea" response from a lot of people.  Enchanter seems to be the "Masters of Mana" as it were.  From teh lvl 34 mana sieve, to the 39 mana DoT tap, to Theft of Thought, and the other numerous Mana drain spells.  This idea came to me during a duel in the arena.<BR>What this spell currently does, fyi: 900dmg over 3 mins 30 seconds.  lowers Intelligence, lowers wisdom, and lowers Mana by 700.  What if we were to remove the damage aspect of it, and make the mana sieve, a mana tap?  I'd see it as an upgrade to Wandering Mind.  Tack on a big recast time like 4 or five minutes (It is 700 mana over 3minutes after all).  On a side note, it would also be a neat idea if it also tapped the Int and Wisdom of the NPC, and gave it to us, while the DoT was in effect.  That's my radical nifty idea =D<P>Memory Blur Series: So far, I love em.  I keep in my book everytime I fight.  They get me out of trouble, in a very good way =).  My only tiff about the spell is, we don't get a message if they've been resisted.  This has been stated before, but it's a big one =)  The spells themselves are great, just we'd like to know if they stuck or not.  I have been hearing that the lvl 55 upgrade doesn't give us the same result as Reoccuring Amnesia or Blankt of Forgetfullness is, but I haven't had the chance to use that, so I will let others comment on it.<P>Ok that's it for spells, and I'm almost done *Yay!*  I just want to touch upon two more points before I wrap up.<P>Magic Resistances:  Now, to my knowledge, we are the onyl class totally dependent on one resistance check.  And in Velious, the MR is very high.  Infact, it is one of the reasons I went back to Kunark, because, it was easier.  Stuff stuck very well, and I didn't have the white knuckle keyboard effect when I was mezzing in Sebilis =)  Just to side bar a moment, this is my inner monologue when I mezz incomings. "Ok, come on moust pick up that Dar. Go mez...stick....stick..stick...stick...stick...stick...NICE!!  Ok Jin yer next...stick...stick...stick..stick...stick..awwww crap!!!".  It only seems to be in Velious, but maybe if you guys could take a look at the MR there, it's pretty nuts.  I have trouble sticking stuff to greens after I tash =)<P>Singe Target Mez/AE mez overwriting bug: With the risk of opening Pandora's box over this again, let me give you a little history on the big tiff this set off.  Way back when, Arch Mage at the time, Geoffery Zatnik said that single target mez not overwriting AE mez was a bug.  But due to a plehtora of other things on his plate, he said it was low priority and it'd be a while before he did anything about it.  Ok cool, fair enough.  Enter Abashi, who came out and said that it was no bug, and that the spells were working as intended.  I would post the responses from it, but A) There are children reading B) Enchanters stopped becoming the soft spoken people we usually are =)  I think what we are looking for is some closure on the deal.  Is it a bug?  Is it working as intended.  The reason why we got set off, I think, because we saw GZ as being the "spell Expert" and when Abashi came along and said: No this is how it was planned, right after GZ said it was a bug he wanted to fix.  <BR>/vent off =)<BR>So, a final word on this would be great.  If it is a bug and you're going ot fix it *drool*.  But IMO, enchanters have been doing just fine ever since release, and it may makes us a wee bit overpowered if you did that.  Don't get me wrong, if you did it, I'd be doing cartwheels, and build an altar to you as my new EQ god!  Ok, that was an exaggeration, I can't carthweel that well. =)<P>Wow, I wrote a novel, heh.  Anyways, in closing; I think enchanters right now, are pretty well balanced, we just need a few tweaks here and there.  I'd really like to put an emphasis on my idea to change Torment of Agrli, because it seems like a very good idea, and owuld fit very well into our line up.  I am very content with the class, and very glad I got to have my say here.  Thankyou for you time,<BR>/bow.<P>-Utaman Dal'Illusao &lt;Black Tower&gt;<BR>Lvl. 52 enchanter Xegony.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>*BIG bump* heh<P>*General*<BR>Can you make it so components don't get eaten in the event of a loss of concentration, ESPECIALLY in places like town?  Losing that silver bar because you may have accidentally moved and channeling didn't take effect really does get annoying after a while if you have a chronic habit of it.<P>Sorry, I got carried away and went for general complaints (tedious and mana costly, as an example) as well as possible balance things. ;)  I also took your (Absor's) "broken things" to include "redundant" or "generally unused"...<P>*Spells*<BR>Sentinel: agreed - it has no use, and you can't even willingly cancel it after casting.  Kill it, I won't even ask for a replacement, heh, though my spellbook will have a nice hole in the middle then.  The most it accomplishes is being great at GM (read: uber) events when you're feeling the need to have an account suspension/banning for either causing either half the zone to LD, or the zone itself to crash. ;)<P>Charm/Mez - gotta agree also on the "cannot be used on this target," message's case.  I never even knew the Mesmerize series didn't work on giants until I got the message for it, during an overpull even.  Imagine how fun that was to discover. ;)<P>Mez part 2 - Why is Rapture a 24 second duration?  Sure it's low resist, but.. a 57+ spell lasting so little time?  Isn't the idea to be stronger the higher you go, spells become more powerful etc.?  Rapture becomes the level 50+ Mesmerize for about 10.5 times the mana cost of the original.  My question is: how mana efficient is it to keep spending 200+ mana every 24 seconds?  Heck, if Entrance works just as well (only level 31 here, so I'm still a little ignorant :P ), I'd rather use that.<P>Enchant &lt;blah&gt; - weapons, weapons weapons.  I have to ask this: why can't we get targettable spells similar to Call of Sky?  Spells that buff/cause effects/procs in weapons/armor would be *cough* in our field.  That's one of the biggest complaints I have since Velious came out, seeing things that have been long requested by our class added in the Ranger spell repetoire.<P>Thicken Mana line - sure we're starting to get these used more, but seriously: just how many recipes are there that require "Vials of Viscous/Cloudy/Enchanted/Distilled/Purified Mana"?  I don't think I'm far off saying I run out of fingers and toes in the counting, but I could be wrong since I haven't been an avid Velious journeyman yet.  Also, why on earth do Distill and Purify Mana require, respectively, sapphires and rubies?  What do I look like, a jeweler? ;)  (I am a jeweler, for the record, but still.. 132pp or so for something I have yet to  hear be of good report or praiseworthy.)<P>Tepid Deeds line - who's defined to be the crowning class of slowing/hasting?  us for hasting, that's a given, but who is it for slowing?  Shaman, or Enchanters?  Make up your minds with those percentages, honestly. ;)<P>Sympathetic Aura line - I'm guessing Shaman trump us here cha wise on basis of being the general stat buffers as far as spell-casting goes?<P>Gift of Magic line - Yay, I can cast Enthrall one more time! (Gift of Magic)  How likely is that to change anything?  *insert shameless plug for making it increase mana on a percentage basis here, but make it a low percentage (15% for Brilliance?)*<P>Suggestion - group Breeze (enough said), and a lower level for Boon of the Clear Mind.  We have a gap of 13 between Breeze and Clarity, and about 23 between Clarity and Boon of the Clear Mind.  Is it me or is there a something a trifle strange with this gap between these spells as far as total mana expenditure goes?  I swear I use about 30-40% of my mana (at clvl 31) to Clarity my group if there's about 4 casters in it, including self and hybrids.  Sure between 29-39 we should use Clarity on a single-target basis, but in the 40's?  That's where it starts to become less a BlueBarBother(tm), but seriously, it strikes me as unnecessary downtime to have to reclarity everyone one at a time as you get higher up.  Group members tend to gripe and/or blacklist you if you don't, or rather, can't on basis of no mana from the last pull because it was a nasty one and you had to spend your mana charming and mezing and hasting and slowing and debuffing (did I miss anything?) as necessary.  Personal experience.<P>*Pet*<BR>No objections here, although having a level 57+ pet spell that looks completely different from the norm would be spiffy.  It would be somewhat taking a cue from Necromancer and Magician pets getting a different appearance as they get higher (Emissary of Thule being a spectre pet, versus all the skeleton models, and Monster Summoning picking a model from the zone at random).  I still want a floating suit of armor, and it'd be so in theme with the rest of the pet series, animated weapons/armor!  Plus, what harm is there in us getting a level 56+ pet spell?  We're also considered a pet class, so what happened to us having one in the stratospheric levels also?<P>Suggestion here, to bring up charm again:  I like the ideas given by, say, druids about non-aggro after charm wear off.  This could be a place where the Alliance line could be umm.. very nice and useful than for attempting to navigate through an area: alliance mob and if it hits amiable and up, it reduces likelihood for auto-hate-master post charming the more positive faction you have.  If you really wanted to make it fun, add in statements like "Pleasure to do you such a favor" when charm is gone (on death even? ;)<P>*Quests*<BR>Ever notice how hard it is to do your quests if you're not agnostic?  The significant examples being Tashania, the Staff of the Serpent, and the Incandescent Mask quest (both at the Temple of Solusek Ro).  They all require a neat trip into the Neriak 3rd Gate, which is quite the hair-raiser if you're like me and have Mithaniel Marr for a deity.  That means going invis the whole way to avoid training the zone.  Most likely, also, that means I can't do my epic quest on basis of having to talk (yes, talk, not simply give items to) a mob in the Temple of Bertoxxulis, therefore I'll have to be visible and target-worthy (those spectre pets are gonna have a field day, heh).  But I'm willing to accept the tradeoff of deity for limitation.  It's just that in spite of that: deity-worshippers have to go above and beyond the call of duty as far as factions go regarding some quests, if it's even possible then.  Sure a deity limits your questing ability, but it seems like too much, especially in the epic quest case.  yes, it's supposed to be hard, but it's also supposed to be doable by the class in general, last I heard.  *see part about the Temple of Bertoxxulis*<P>Sooo, can we get more deity-specific quests by chance, just to give us nitpicks like me something less to gripe about? ;)<P>*Illusions*<BR>- Is it just me or does Illusion: Drybone make Illusion: Skeleton utterly pointless and redundant?  One is for looks, the latter one mimics both the former's looks and also adds fire resistance.<P>- As far as Illusions go, I wouldn't mind seeing something like impersonating a deity worshipper (or the deity him/her/itself?  Aren't deity models in the global file anyways?), a spell that's town-only (no real use in field?).  It randomly picks a worshipped deity from the zone, so one of the Marrs if cast in North Freeport, and Innoruuk in East, and Innoruuk or Agnostic in West Freeport.  <BR>   Now I'm sure I'll get the "makes it too easy to go through zone x without risk."  My answer to that is make it a quest spell like Illusion: Iksar, and Tashania, and just basically make the quest hell (read: one step below being epic), the components and scroll nodrop.<P>Part 2: <BR>Crossing zones and dropping illusions is annoying for the above Neriak reasons.  I myself am dubious to the generic guards "Guard/Dragoon &lt;name&gt;" in Nektulos while under a DE illusion (even after Benevolence; that changes nothing for reaction).  Had a nice surprise at the Nektulos zone in the form of a guard being trained there, once.  So.. being able to cross zones while illusioned would be nice.  I mean, what harm is there in preserving illusions while zoning?  I can't think of any except "Infiltration turns harder" rationale.<P>*Items*<BR>Umm, does the Book of Ancient Restoration even have any USE?  I've certainly not heard of one.  It isn't even used for restoring faded pages for research: the Tome of Endless Enchantments is.  So I'm saying, give us a reason to have it on our research-item vendor, or scrap it: it's meaningless/broken.<P>I can't think of anything else.  Must be my midterm getting closer getting on my mind.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I haven't read this whole post cause pretty much everyone says the same thing.  Anyway, I have a couple of suggestions that might be interesting.  <P>1.  Make the items summoned from the Crystallize Mana line expendable..in other words, let us drink the cloudy mana so the spell has some usefullness.<P>2.  Give us a line of spells that enchant weapons.  For example, maybe one spell would increase Strength and Dex attribute of a weapon while another increased Wisdom or Intelligence.  This could also be used for resist attributes of weapons.  The effects could dissappear when the persone weilding zoned or logged out.  <P><BR>I have only played my enchanter for 24 levels so far and don't really know the issues the high level enchanters face.  It seems they are mad about the high magic resist of 55+ mobs which is understandable since every spell in the enchanter book is magic based.

'Nuff said.<P>2.  Spells = Aggro - The massive built in mega-taunt that seems to go with so many of the enchanter spells (DDs, mez, tash, etc) is a bit excessive.  I've been in groups where I don't touch the mob till it's at half hp, and even tho' the wiz has landes some solid shots, my resisted DD draws the mob onto me faster than I can blink.  Please find a way to lower the aggro rates somehow, especially on our damage spells - at least with mez it makes a bit more sense.<P>3.  Tash - Considering Tash only lowers one resist, I would think it should be better than spells that lower many.  Yet at 44 the tash spell lowers the MR far less than the malo lowers *all* resists.  This doesn't seem to make a great deal of sense - please increase the amount of MR that tash decreases.  This might also help some with the Velious/high MR problem.<P>4.  Debuffs - There doesn't seem to be any effect at all to our strength Debuffs and almost no noticeable affect to AGI/AC debuffs.  The only one that seems to make a difference is Speed debuffs.  Please either find a way for these spells to have an impact or replace them with lines that have some use.  The only use they seem to have is in PVP, and, as has been often stated in the past, this is primarily a PVE game.<P>5.  Whirl/Dyn's - Besides the fact that they break when someone sneezes, they give an effect message even when they aren't working at all.  My suggestion would be to replace the effect with just a straight, single target stun effect.  This will save us the problem of aggroing guards when trying to help a newbie without KSing by using the color line &lt;grin&gt;<P>6.  Buffs - I've heard it said that the enchanter's main roles are crowd control and buffs.  Please have our buffs last a bit longer, then.  I don't use the speed line too often since Augmentation lasts so much longer even tho' there are times a straight up speed buff might be preferred.<P>7.  Mez - So far as I know, this is the only spell line anyone gets that gets worse at higher levels and not better - greater mana for a shorter duration.  Doesn't seem to make much sense, really.  Please make them cheaper or last longer.<P>8.  High MR/Velious mobs - I was really looking forward to Velious, but I've shied away from it after having to run for the zone when none of my spells would stick.  Increasing the MR debuff with Tash might help, but other casters are also finding themselves stuck...possible revamp the MR overall?<P>9.  Charm - If I can get a good distance between myself and my mezzed target, I'm removed from the aggro list.  My suggestion would be for Charm to work the same way.  I don't think a 'no aggro' charm effect would be balancing even tho' it would make sense.<P>10.  Mem Blur - A failure/resist message is desperately needed.  After I mem blurred a rooted cyclops 3 times at level 44 (the only spell I cast, btw - my LD partner had rooted it), it showed up three minutes later on the other side of the zone to knock me around.<P>11.  Illusions - It is sort of a bit insulting that two other classes get post-44 illusions while the 'Illusionist' class gets none.  I'm also in agreement with folks who think we should stop blurring the line between 'transformation' and 'illusion' as the game designers give them both the same effect.  Since there are existing group 'illusion/transformation' spells, I'd like to see some added post-44 for the enchanter (if not sooner).  In addition, since we took the same nerf as the druids with the wolf illusion (not indoors since no sow indoors), I think some small movement increase is neither unbalancing nor out of line.  Also, some faction effect should occur with skeleton/drybones illusions.  At the very least, other skeletons should be indifferent.  In addition, illusions should hide religion, and I believe the Iksar illusion still leaves you KOS to folks in Cabilis even if you are Agnostic.<P>12.  DoTs - Since our only DoT line is linked to a relatively useless debuff, it does less damage than DoTs of other classes.  In addition, the initial DD component of the spell tends to break roots.  Maybe a second line of straight up DoTs or else removing the debuff component might help here.<P>13.  Magic Resist - With the exception of Clerics, I believe Enchanters are the only casting class whose every spell is based on MR.  Every other line gets at least two and sometimes as many as three different styles of spells (shamans - cold, poison, disease; Necros - fire, disease, poison)  This sort of ties back to the Tash problem in as that our debuff line is also the lowest, and shamans and mages can debuff all Resistances at once.  I don't know what can be done about this, tho', without adding new spell lines to the class.<P>14.  Animations - here's the tricky one.  We're not a pet class, but we have pet spells every four levels.  It's one of our biggest lines of spells.  However, despite being masters of control, we can't even get them to so much as stand still.  I'd like to see the higher level animations be controllable, and it would be nice if the 39+ could be summoned with two weapons instead of weapon and shield.  I think the fact that they are rather low in the HP department and that we have no pet heals/pet-specific buff spells is enough of a detriment.<P>15.  Charm & Animations - if enchanter pets aren't going to be controllable, then I don't see any reason why we can't charm one beastie while we have a pet up.  NPC enchanters have this capability, and the pet commands wouldn't be confused by having two targets since the pets don't accept them.<P>16.  Gear - Incandescent gloves and mask are nice, but I'd like to see more mid-level quest 'armor' for all casters.  Questing is fun for some of us, and by level 30 or so I'd completed all of the 'enchanter only' quests (pre-Velious).  I'd also like to see more AC/HP gear and/or right clickable gear available, especially adding spells and effects that are not part of our normal line.  If other classes can get enchanter illusions, DDs and DoTs, I don't think it's unbalanced to have non-enchanter effects available on gear, be it dropped or quested.<P>17.  Sentinel - Make it go away, please &lt;g&gt;<P>18.  Rune IV - please make the component a cheaper gem.  Going from 8 gold to 11 PP is a bit extreme, especially considering that Rune V has the same component as IV.  Folks might use the spell if it used, say, amber or pearls.<P>19.  Feedback - Umm....why?  Since I'm being fair as to what additions enchanters should have, this spell just doesn't seem to fit.  A short term, fire based DS?  I don't get it.<P>20. Enchanting items - It's the reason I chose the class in the first place and I keep holding out hope that we might get this spell line - not through money sinks that are the trade skills, but an honest to goodness 'enchant weapon' or 'enchant armour' spell line.  Hand an enchanter a finished weapon or piece of armour and let them cast a spell which gives it a proc or a spell capability, be it temporary (duration or 'until you leave the zone') or even (if the cost is high enough) permanent.<P>21.  Trade skills - since these are currently the only way for an enchanter to enchant, please lift the 'only one trade skill at 200+' cap.  If I want to enchant any armour, I need a skill well above 200, but if I want to enchant platinum or velium I need the same.<P>22.  Enchant metals - Why do the imbue spells pop up at a lower level than the enchant smithing metal spells?  Shouldn't an enchanter be able to make enchanted armour at the same level a cleric or shaman can?  And can you *please* adjust the components required for these spells to something reasonable?  Some enchant spells require high level drops while others cost a few plat from a vendor.  The worst of these is the blue diamond needed for enchant mithril now that blue diamonds can make much better jewelry (three blue diamonds for a wis 4 int 4 mr 4 tunic which requires a trade skill around 240 in addition to half a dozen other rare drop components versus the new platinum/velium jewelry that requires the same skill level and none of the other components)<P>23.  Umbra - as has been pointed out, same AC as the lower level spell for more mana.<P>I think that about sums it up.  Thanks for taking the time out to discuss all the classes like this, Absor.  It's a great help all around!<P>SG</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Please DO NOT CHANGE GIFT OF BRILLIANCE!<P>I don't think the people asking for the change actually use the darn spell.  Before you complain about it, please acheive level 60 and use it.  It's wonderful!  At level 60 I do not need more Int.  I do need faster mana regen.  If you change GoB to include Clarity II, then I cannot use Gift of Pure Thought (the group Clarity II spell).  Gift of Brilliance lasts a long time (around an hour), so the big mana cost isn't that big of a deal to me.  The added regen effect more than makes up for it.<P>Please talk to some good level 60 enchanters before you destroy this spell. <P>You people who complain try casting Gift of Pure Thought and Gift of Brilliance on a hybrid.  The combination is really great.<P>Other than that, most have summed it up very well.<P>1) High taunt spells mean we tank a lot.  Something to help with that.  I am going to get yelled at for this, but I think the taunt factor is fine on Tash.  We are a powerful class in many situations.  That needs to be balanced out and I think the taunt does that.  But, give me some way to raise my AC/HP a bit more.<P>2) Velious has mobs with insane MR.  Give us a better Tash or lower the MR.<P>3) Whoever designs enchanter high level gear has little clue about the class.<P>4) The memblur lines do not do what I believe they are intended to do.<P>5)  We are little but buff machines on big raids.<P>6)  Look at the duration vs. mana cost on the high end mez lines.<P>7) I could personally care less about more illusions, but lots here seem to care for some reason.<P>8) Boon of Garou, deal with the duration/recast time.  I liked the suggestion of having it 5 times the duration for 5 times the cost.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Currently I play in a "vision" group. Warrior, Cleric, Enchanter, Ranger, Shaman, Druid. We have 0 downtime except when new mobs are being brought to the group. We have been playing together over a year now and have developed a very good fighting style. I am basing all my changes from this perspective.<P>Take a look at the "taunt" factor of enchanter spells on 50+ mobs. <P>Currently when we enter into combat we follow a 4mm rule. This rule is to wait till the mob has recieved 4mm of melee loss from its health bar. At this point "Enchanter casts Tash" "Shaman slows" "Druid dots" "Enchanter cripples" "Shaman dots" Then the warrior and ranger melee the mob to death.<P>On occasions we have to adjust to a 5mm start time in order to compensate for mobs that get picky on who their suppose to be beating on.<P>What throws this all out of wack is either the mob just gets mad and desides it no longer wants to beat on the warrior or someones spell was resisted and it had to be cast again.<P>A Enchanter that is casting only tash and cripple has a very big chance that they will land at the top of the hate list and stay there for a very long time. I think we all agree that tash and cripple needs to be appllied relitivly early in a fight to be of any use. Yet if not done perfectly it results in a Enchanter that is tanking. This with just casting two spells.<P>The "taunt" of spells can be fixed many way other then lowering it from the casters side. I have no problem letting a caster get beat on a round or two for over casting. Giving a Warrior more taunt would help just as much as reducing the Enchanter spells taunt but thats another topic.<P>Look into the way "memblur" effects the memory of dots.<P>The order of the players on the hate list can be fixed relitivly easy by using a "memblur". Except the poor caster of a dot. I have no solution for this fix that doesnt make it "to easy" to regain the proper person tanking but maybe someone will have a way dots can be effected by a "memblur". This would help alot with the "taunt" factor of alot of spells over all by being able to use a "memblur" more effectivly.<P>The use of "mez" on 50+ mobs<P>Alot of mobs cannot be mezzed or even charmed in the new worlds. When fighting with a single group you need to beable to bring the fight to one mob at a time. Without the use of "mezzing" a mob we are left to using root to keep the mobs far enough away to kill one at a time. We all know how well root works and with any mob that summons we can't use a root that causes damage. So maybe we can get Enchanters back to being crowd control again by letting them be able to mez a few more mobs then befor.<P>All the problems I have seen are based on play level 50-60 in a single well balanced group. Enchanters are truly a great class but just require a little tuning to get them back where they were 1-50.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Utaman:<P>&gt;&gt;Torment of Argli: Ok, this is my radical idea of the post. And it seems like a nifty one, and got the "ooohhhh good idea" response from a lot of people. Enchanter seems to be the "Masters of Mana" as it were. From teh lvl 34 mana sieve, to the 39 mana DoT tap, to Theft of Thought, and the other numerous Mana drain spells. This idea came to me during a duel in the arena.<BR>What this spell currently does, fyi: 900dmg over 3 mins 30 seconds. lowers Intelligence, lowers wisdom, and lowers Mana by 700. What if we were to remove the damage aspect of it, and make the mana sieve, a mana tap? I'd see it as an upgrade to Wandering Mind. Tack on a big recast time like 4 or five minutes (It is 700 mana over 3minutes after all). On a side note, it would also be a neat idea if it also tapped the Int and Wisdom of the NPC, and gave it to us, while the DoT was in effect. That's my radical nifty idea =D<P>Torment of Argli works over 2 minutes, not 3.5.  It does 600 damage, not 900.  And it is a very nice spell just as it is.  Combined with asphyxiate, we can do at least 1600 damage with dot's every 2 minutes.  It's also very useful for the PvP guys, as it overwrites splurt... and clarity overwrites torment.  In short, don't touch this spell, it's awesome how it is and one of my favorites from Kunark.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>After two years, are there any particular issues that the development team is ALREADY considering to change for enchanters?<P>I mean practically every issues brought up has already had several of it's own long threads. It's nice for us all to REPOST these ideas but I have the impression that the dev team is going to recieve a list of well-known issues and say, 'oh, so these are the enc issues! We never knew!". That is very frustrating. Where is their list???<P>Doesn't VI KNOW that the Lull and Whirl lines are useless??? It is their game and their world but they act like only we can tell them the things that need fixing (two years later).<P>Here's what I think kinda briefly:<P>1. Illusions are not important to the most important thing in EQ: fighting. I would consider it a total waste to talk about, but since YOU decided to name us ILLUSIONISTS the issue cannot be avoided. I only care about performance in battle.<P>2. I feel that upon character creation, on day 1 of EQ, I was led to believe that my enchanter would gain abilities and power that it does not ever achieve. When it said my enc was high difficulty, I said 'fine' because I thought that I would, in the end as the guide suggested, become the most powerful of classes. It also said I could enchant items which we really can't do. I envisioned being powerfull and looking through the spells I thought that stunning, mezzing, and charming would be the key to my power, along with clarity, speed, slow and debuffs. I based 1500 hours of playing time on these ideas.<P>3. Then I found out that there was a "vision" that allowed for never-ending changes to the games balance. I believe this to be a critical fault. The fact that VI is making an effort to LOCK class balancing is an admission of this fault. We recieve no retro-compensation for playing thousands of hours under an admittedly flawed system.<P>4. I found most spells while sounding good peformed poorly and would get me killed. ie, lull is resisted and you pull camp onto you, whirl doesn't work, charm breaks after 2 secs, stun lasts one second, etc. And wasted spells you never even want to use like blindness, sentinal, a 7hp DamageShield, etc. All this going against being powerfull.<P>5. Then I found out that I can't mez anything with a giant flag. I just don't understand this. This seems to be one of those 'divine intervention' things but heck I put all those hours into my enc, hoping to become POWERFULL, and then I can't mez a hill giant. I think that is stupid. Right there it is like VI, just face slapped enchanters (I couldn't resist). 'Oh you think you are powerfull with your mez??? Not!!!' I think we should be able to mez ANY creature and it certainly goes against my 'vision' that we cannot.<P>6. Then, I leveled up to 50 and went to Velious to find out exactly how ill-informed I had been when I started my enc. I am good for nothing there thanks to INSANE MR. I mean why did I run to TEN cities and use all my illusions, enchant coins three different times, to get Tashania Quest -MR spell which doesn't help in the cool SoV expansion? Wasn't the old Tashanian Enchanter some master of Magic Resistence. If so, and I did the quest, then why wouldn't Tashania work in Velious? It should, so INCREASE this QUEST SPELLS stats so it reduces A LOT MORE MR.<P>7. I always thought it was ridiculous how short lasting our stun spells were. What good is stunning something for ONE second??? It's a stun not a bash! Then an upgrade to FOUR seconds! Then to Six! Another words when I think of being powerfull and stunning I am thinking of longer durations.<P>8. The shielding line should give WAY more AC. I see this a HUGE problem. This self buff should get us on par with other classes AC wise but it does not. If it gave more AC then when we get agrroed do to resists it might not be so bad. As of now getting agroed is a life and death situation, more AC would help with that.<P>That's all I got for now - more power! I'll leave details to others who are more adept.<P>Odid<BR>51 Illusionist<BR>No double-dipping!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I used to play a 50+ Enchanter on the Eci server.  I say used to because I made the decision yesterday to quit the game based largely on the nerfing of my role in Velious and what I see as my future being one of becoming a Pez dispenser.  I believe that Enchanters 1 to 50 are balanced, and that NOTHING needs to be done outside of looking at a few select bugs.  They require no new spells, and no balance changes.  But 50+ is an entire different matter:<P>In a post before mine, Asterix indicated that there are 4 types of enchanters: <P>Control<BR>Illusion<BR>Enchanter<BR>Debuffer.  <P>I myself am a Crowd Control expert.  This is the job that I signed up for, and this is what I do best.  One of those quick thinking, fast acting, with blood as cool as ice train stoppers.  I was a good Enchanter, and I loved my job and loved the game in general.  <P>There were things that I was not happy about, but on balance I was very satisfied with my class.  I never wanted to solo, I always wanted to group with good players and go out and have some fun.  And fun to me was big fat hairy trains!  Trains where Enchanters were outnumbered 10 to 1.  If I thought I could pull it off, it wasn’t fun.  I thrived on the challenges of a near wipeout.<P>On Eci, I have spent a lot of time in the Plane of Hate, and led regular raids there introducing a very large number of people to the planes, and teaching them the necessary skills for raiding.  One of the things that I really hated was fighting Maestro.  You see Maestro was 100% magic resistant, which means all I could do is watch and this drove me crazy.  But what the hell it's only one boss mob I can deal with it.  I'm useful in most everything else.  It never bothered me that I could not land any spells on Spite Golems, after all most everything else in the Plane I could affect.<P>But enter Velious, where an entire continent of Maestro type encounters was introduced.  Instead of being an active participant whose contributions were positive and unmistakable, I'm now reduced to little more than a pez dispenser for Clarity & Haste.  Above all else I want to be useful, I want to participate, to contribute, and to have some fun.  But buffing isn't fun, although it may be a contribution.  If my future is reduced to following around a raid and standing up every 27 mins to cast clarity & haste and not being able to do anything else, then that is a future that I bluntly am not interested in seeing.<P>I don't want to be a god, I don't want to be able to mes everything in a zone, or even on a continent.  But I do want to be effective.  If I can't mes, that's ok and I can deal with that.  But if I can't:<P>Mes<BR>Charm<BR>Root<BR>Stun<BR>Slow<BR>Cripple<BR>DOT<BR>DD<P>Then I have a real big problem.  I'm not a valued member of a team anymore; I'm a buff dispenser.  This is what I feel is really at the heart of the Enchanter's feelings of betrayal.  And this is what ultimately has led me to the decision to quit Everquest.  I feel betrayed, I feel hurt, and above all I feel like I have been castrated.<P>So how can I be made happy?<P>I'm a pretty easy guy to satisfy, all I want is a future where I am useful and a positive contributor in a role other than buffer.<P>If you want to disable mes on a monster for game play reasons, I'm fine with that.  I have never been able to mes a boss mob, and I have never been able to mes giants and I am fine with that.  The giant & boss flags are great way to limit the use of mes, and I absolutely endorse their use for that purpose.<P>One more thing, there are reports of Necromancers being able to mes monsters in Velious that Enchanter’s cannot.  This is just plain wrong.  If a Necromancer can mes a_monster_01, then an Enchanter should be able to mes a_monster_01 more easily.  Mesing is our core competency, and as such we deserve to do it better than anyone else.  If an Enchanter cannot land a mes on a certain mob, then neither Bards nor Enchanters should be able to do it either.<P>But when you set an entire zone's MR rating so high that I can't land any spells on them that is just not cool!  What am I supposed to do? Sit and watch?  I'm sorry but that is not a satisfying game play experience, and is not one for which I am willing to continue to pay money for.<P>Limited use of high MR has its place, for example I don't think that anyone has a problem with Spite Golems in the Plane of Hate because they are a fairly low population of the plane. <P>20% total MR resistant mobs in a zone is perfectly acceptable, it adds challenge and is a nice touch IMO.  But when the vast majority or even all the mobs in a zone are 100% MR then you have not only destroyed my ability to contribute, but you have ruined my game play experience.<P>This situation can only be fixed by lowering the magic resist of high level Velious dungeons, or by giving us new spells that check a resist other than magic.  With the introduction of Velious, other classes were given new spells with different resist checks so that they could continue to be useful participants.  Why could the same courtesy not be extended to Enchanters?  Instead we were given new spells that are more insult than improvement.  A +50 mana buff, and a new melee buff with restrictions on its casting and stacking so severe, that it is not feasible to use.<P>If you will not reduce the magic resist in Velious, then give us the tools to be effective in this environment.  If everything is 100% MR, and all of our spells are magic based (except for tash), then we are emasculated.<P>Off the top of my head (and I haven't thought much about it) here are a few suggestions:<P>Give us a stronger form of Tash.  This would allow us to be more effective in these high MR areas.  But I recognize that there may still be areas where even with super-tash we cannot be effective.  To function in these situations we need spells that check other resistances.<P>Poison or Disease based root.  This would give us a very tangible contribution on Velious raids.  When we can't mes or charm something, give us the ability to still affect it via a root that we can stick.  One of my favorite zones is the Hole, specifically because there are mobs there that are NOT mesable.  But I can still root park them, I can still slow them, and I can still stun them so I still can have a hell of a lot of fun  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I don’t believe that we need a new form of slow that we can stick, the Shaman have the same problem with MR and their slow line.  If a new slow is to be given to anyone, IMO it should go to the Shaman.  Give the Enchanters the ability to root park these high MR mobs, and give the Shaman the ability to slow/debuff them.<P>A Disease based DD.  This should not check the same resist as our new root.  That way if we cant mes (MR), and we can't charm (MR), and we cant root (PR), then we can hopefully at least cast our new DD (DR).  This would give us something at least to do as a last resort.  Enchanter's do not as a normal course of action cast offensive spells, but if we cannot cast any of our defensive spells, then casting a DD is better than sitting on our asses watching the fight like a coward.<P>As a side note, I don't believe that Enchanters should get any new DoT's.  I don't think that Enchanters should have ever gotten DoT's to begin with.  If there is one thing that doesn't fit our role and doesn't fit with our other spell lines it is the dot.<P>There are other issues with the Enchanter that need to be looked at, but from my point of view the only thing that I care about is the Enchanters role (or lack thereof) in Velious.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A few low level observations... <BR>1. We could use a low level cheap spell to practice evocation.. Flare at 1st or 4th maybe if we don't want to annoy the magicians? <P>2. Is it really a good thing that my first level Human enchanter couldn't buy tiny daggers in Qeynos?<P>3.Upgrades to minor illusion: Major Illusion, does the same thing but with more objects (towers, rocks, etc. L16) Mobile Illusion: Why is that Rock moving? (Something in the thirties unless you want to take away the indiff faction adjustment. Then  it should be 28 or so?)<P>4. While on the subject of Minor Illusion.. can you make it where minor DOESN'T cancel SoW? That's just annoying.<P>5. Stackable illusions for size/gender/clothing  and weapons would be great fun too. Maybe even give us a tiny self ac buff based on type of armor since we probably need it more than other casters? er or not.<P>6. Lull line needs it's effects improved. Maybe act like mez only on mobs that are not agro'd yet?<BR>Would improve ability for the lowest level enchanters to get in groups. <P>7. I understand you want to give sight abilities to poor night blind humans via illusions, but is it neccessary for me to lose my ultravision when casting illusion: human to go into a city? You know, I don't carry a light source normally...<P>8. Enchanters (the master of jewelry making) should be able to make an int/chr piece. Think about adding some real expensive/rare drop gem for that maybe.<P>9. Whirl till you hurl is nearly useless. If it ever lasted half the twelve seconds it's supposed to last would be a good spell<P>10. Could you change the way pets behave a bit... the animations that is. I would like to have my pet stand 3 to 4 paces behind me. since I can't /pet do jack with him please keep him out of my line of site while he's not fighting.<P>11. Debuffs are broken against mobs and a waste of mana. Languid pace is the only line that makes any difference in a fight. Keep them in for PvP use though.<P><BR>I cannot speak for the high level game. My highest level character was 24 and he was a monk. But I have a good understanding of the low level game. After quitting twice and then starting over I've been through it enough.<P>Tyas<BR>DE Ench Morrell-Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I understand completely all the 40 to 50 Enchanters saying they are pretty happy with things. You damn well should be. In those levels Enchanters are very powerful, necessary, and above all FUN. All the training you are now doing, learning to coordinate mezzes, stuns, charms and buffs, guaging the strengths and weaknesses of various group make-ups, and determining te best strategy, are all so that at 55+ you can cast Clarity II and right click your Shissar Staff every few minutes.<P>Here are the things I would like to see in terms of balance:<P>1) An unresistable mem blur for post 50 mobs. If it doesn't work on Gods, so be it. But it should be unresistable for "normal' encounters. I much prefere using spells to keep myself alive than better HP and AC gear. (summary: make Recurring Amnesia WORK!)<P>2) Make GoK and Rapture WORK! These spells are very weak (relatively) to the crowd control spells we get from 16 to 49 in terms of mana cost, duration and recast. For Agnost's sake let them WORK!<P>....much further down........<P>1,239,734) Give Wizards pointy hats<P>1,239,735) Give enchanters Illusion Gender, or Target, or Class.<P>I couldn't possibly care less about these illusions. Give me the first two and I will never complain about balance again.<P>It seems that Enchanters are the Point Guards of Norrath for the first 55 levels or so, then all we are good for is shooting free throws in the 4th Quarter. You gave us a job, please let us do it.<P>Qindara Psyrulean</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>ILLUSIONS:<BR>Please complete out Illusion line of spells.  Many enchanters claim this to be a novelty line of spells.  It is not.  These are utility spells just like any other spells Enchanters get.  Two solutions would be to either add additional illusions or to grant the enchanter class group illusions.  I would much rather see group illusions but have seen previous posts about this shot down by Verant.  I do not see it as overpowering the Enchanter class but my Vision and your Vision have always clashed.  Another part of the illusion that I always thought was a Bug is the fact that we can not Illusion Spirit Wolf indoors.  If it is, as Verant has stated before, that it is just an illusion and that the Druid's Wolf form is a true transformation, why can Enchanters not cast a mere simple illusion indoors?  We do not get Sow with it, we do not get any of the advantages that a druid gets, yet we are still subject to the same penalties.<P>BOON OF GAROU:<BR>What can I say.  It was a great idea until it got implemented.  Please either shorten the duration of the recast time or extend the duration of the spell effects.  I understand Verant not wanting an entire zone of Werewolves running around, but on major Plane or Dragon raids where there are a lot of Tanks and very few Enchanters, it would be nice to be able to keep this up on at least two of your tanks without having a time period where one of your tanks are not Booned.<P>PETS: (Or Animations according to Verant)<BR>I can understand that at low levels we may not be able to control our Pets.  Well, not really, but for the sake of argument, I can understand.  However, at higher levels,(say Post level 39) Enchanters should be able to at least give a few rudimentary commands to our pets.  Maybe not as many as the other "pet" classes get, but a few would be nice.  Currently, I view the enchanter pets as a glorified DoT spell.  I mean, even Mickey Mouse could give a few commands to the animated broom(s) in Fantasia.  He was not a master of the art, but I am sure his master could control them.<P>Whirl Till You Hurl:<BR>Remove it or fix it.  This spell is completely worthless.  Either the stun breaks the whirl/root effect or the whirl/root effect breaks stun.  I do not know which and really do not care.  As it currently is, it is a worthless spell.<P>RUNE Line of spells:<BR>It was stated earlier so I will keep this one short.  Reduce the component cost.  A jump from a Jasper that costs 8gp for RuneIII to a 10p5g Peridot for RuneIV is ridiculous.  For only a hundred or more HPs.  I can cast 11 to 13 RuneIII for the same cost as one Rune IV, which do you think I will cast?  Let me put it to you this way, I do not carry Peridots.<P>WANDERING MIND Spell:<BR>What a stupid spell.  This spell is similar to Theft of Thought but is much, much less useful.  It takes 5 mana to cast and taps 120 mana over a period of 2 minutes.  2 Minutes?  Most MoBs are dead by the end of 2 minutes.  Heck, most are dead after 30 seconds.  And the recast time on this spell is absurd.  And only 120 Mana?  I can burn 120 mana in my sleep.  Perhaps if you shortened the recast time, change the effects to be an instant 120 mana tap, it would be useful.  Currently, it is a waste of a spell slot.<P>JEWELRY CRAFT:<BR>Yes, I know, Jewelry craft is not really a Enchanter thing, but because Enchanters are the primary class that practice this trade, I am going to put it here.  First, I have always thought it extremely stupid that one ring takes up the same amount of space that a 2-handed sword takes.  Or a bracelet that takes up just as much space as 20 water flasks or 20 loaves of bread.  I mean, would it really be that unbalancing of crafted jewelry was stackable?  It may be kind of difficult to code into the game that only one piece of jewelry can fit into a body slot, but I know it can be done.  But as long as the jewelry is in a backpack or main inventory slot, it should be stackable.  Second, please incorporate Molds into Jewelry so that a Rose Quarts and a bar of silver can make any piece of jewelry, not just a ring.  Each piece can still have the +2 Int stat, but it is just silly that all you can make with that combination is a ring.  From a role-playing stand point, it is silly.<P>CHARM/Mesmerize SPELLS:<BR>Please Fix Glamour of Kintaz, Rapture and Dictate.  Currently, the mana vs. duration seems way unbalanced.  It has always seemed that, in the past, spell upgrades would take more mana but also have a better effect.  The only "better" effect is that now Enchanters run out of mana more quickly when they have to Mes and charm more often on the higher level mobs that will kill us quicker.  Oh, wait, that is not better.  Please either lower the mana usage on these spells or increase the duration of the spells.  Also, please fix the bug where a higher level Mesmerize spell will not over-write a lower level mesmerize spell.  It just seems wrong, from a role-playing view, that a higher level spell will not overwrite a lower level spell.<P>ENCHANTING WEAPONS:<BR>Please allow Enchanter to at least cast temporary enchantments on weapons.  Similar to the New ranger line of spells.  Make the enchantment only temporary.  Either time based or zone based.  Low level Enchantment could be just making a normal weapon Magic for a fixed duration.  Higher level enchantments can add procs like Life tap or Slow or even a small DD.<P>UPGRADE TO OUR LEVEL 1 Strength Spell:<BR>Yes, I know we get a whole line of Strength spells that have a HP shield built in, but these spells are worthless.  I do not know any Tanks that want this spell because it drops as soon as the HP shield wears off.  To this day, I still use my level 1 STR spell because it is the only one we have.  I do not even bother with the Berserker Strength line of spells because, unless you are power leveling some Newbies, it is worthless.  Yes, I know a few of our illusions have Strength components but those illusions can not be cast in cities or you will die.  Please, maybe a +20 Str spell at 29 and a +30 Str spell at 49 would not be too overpowering.  IMHO.<P>Ok, Now the important stuff:<BR>Enchanters need SoW, Forage, Tracking, Snare or Darness(we are not picky), Pick Locks, Sneak, Backstab, Bash, Duel Wield, Feign Death, Harm Touch, Lay on Hands, Archery, and Mend.  This would not overpower our class and would make for a much more enjoyable game.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  (As you can tell, this last part is just for laughs.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>These are just my ideas, from a level 60 Enchanter played since Day #1 of retail.  Most of these ideas focus on making the Enchanter more then a buffing-machine at level 60 on Raids.<P>I'll start with the "Gift of.." spells you mentioned.  They are a joke and almost completely useless, especially for their mana cost.  The only, easily implentible changes to these spell series are: <P>Increase their mana regen effect so at level 60, Gift of Brilliance = C2 mana regen.  I seriously doubt Verant would implement this.<P>Make these spells VERY efficient mana pumps.  Perhaps make them a DoT effect, so an enchanter can "bind to" another Player Character and transfer a portion of the enchanters mana to the other Play over ## game ticks.  I think this would be quite beneficial.  There are other mana DoTs/transfers in the game, so I'd think this would be easily doable.<P>---<P>Rune series.  The mana cost+reagent cost is completely out of whack with any other form of "healing" spell.  Without doing the math, I'd say a 35% increase in damage absorption across the board.  If anything, these spells should be more efficient then GH/SH because they have the added reagent cost.<P>---<P>Berserker series.  Biggest drawback, they don't stack with other (Shaman/Druid) strength buffs.  Therefor, if you want to "heal" a tank during a raid, you are forced to using the more expensive Rune series.<P>---<P>Tashania series.  For the love of all that is good, address the CRAZY HATE FACTOR caused by these spells.  If you can't do that, add a JOLT component to them.  Basically if you Tash a level 60+ mob, the Enchanter is dead.  This is with the best equipped melee in the game trying to taunt off the enchanter.<P>Wind of Tash...  see above?  It's only good for simulating Death Touches.  My suggestion for these spells is to up the mana cost and make them a SINGLE TARGET Poison based DD spell.  When a mob is 100% immune to MR, this at least would give higher level Enchanters a CHANCE to feel useful.<P>---<P>Multiple lines of STR debuffs.. silly spells, guess they're good for PvP or something.  In an XP group an Enchanter can cast on of these or use his/her nuke to kill the mob faster.  The one way to give some use to these spells is to MAKE MOBS OBEY their debuffed-STR and SNARE/ROOT them.  Last I checked, only humanoid (i.e. guards) were truely snared by these spells.<P>---<P>Choke Series.  Our THIRD stackable Strength Debuff and miniscule amount of damage over 2 minutes.  The only mobs in the game that live over 2 minutes are Scars of Velious boss mobs... unfortunatly, most of those are 100% MR immune.<BR>I believe there's also a stacking issue with the necro Splurt.<P>---<P>Enchanter Direct Damage..Discordant Mind, etc.. remove the stun/interrupt component from all levels of this spell and make them partially resistible.  Enchanters have plenty of more useful stuns.  The cast times are way too long on these series for timed interruption of mob casting.<P>---<P>Enchanter Slow Series:  <BR>Lvl 12: Languid Pace - 50 mana - 30% slow - 2.25s<BR>Lvl 24: Tepid Deeds - 100 mana - 50% slow - 3.5s<BR>Lvl 44: Shiftless Deeds - 200 mana - 65%slow - 6s<BR>Lvl 57: Forlorn Deeds - 225 mana - 70% slow - 6s<P>Shaman Slow Series:<BR>Level 29: Tagar's  - 125 mana  - 50% - 4.25s CAST<BR>Level 39: Togor's - 175 mana - 70% - 5s CAST<BR>Level 51: Turgur's - 250 mana - 75% - 3 SECONDS!<P>Enchanters get a slower casting, less slowing, spell 6 LEVELS after Shaman.  Basically, knock 2 seconds off Forlorn Deeds and the spell series are "balanced" again.<P>---<P>Glamour of Kintaz, Rapture.. ok, sub-level 50 mesmerizes are TOO powerful, but these spells make mesmerize useless at 50+.  Take a trip to PoG ... know how people are doing Crowd Control?  A 75 mana, fast casting, spell called ROOT/FETTER.<BR>PoG mobs RESIST the "low resists" RAPTURE.  That's 425 mana wasted, and no 2nd attempt to mesmerize for 24 seconds.  One possible solution..<P>First step is to reduce the mana cost/remove the cycle times.  200 mana for Glamour, 250-300 mana for Rapture.  Now, we need a downside to these spells - instead of fixed duration mesmos - 24s for Glamour, 30s for Rapture, make them check for break every tick.  Max duration on Glamour 30 seconds, max duration on Rapture 48 seconds.<P>---<P>Umbra seems broke, never seen it grant more AC then Shadow.<P>---<P>Final suggestion... add a new, fixed duration charm (20-30 minutes), at level 60.  There's really NO situation where Dictate's mana cost/recycle time can be justified.  This new spell would:<P>A)  Require huge mana cost, 1000+.  <BR>B)  Require a reagent, 100pp+.<BR>C)  Same level limits as Boltran's.<P>D)  Alternative to huge mana cost, make the charm drain mana from the Enchanter every tick, as long as the Enchanter has mana, the charm "holds."<P>In 6 man XP groups, myself and other Enchanters can "hold" a mob for 2-3 HOURS with Boltrans.  On raids, we have to worry about our pet while buffing 30 other people.  If the Enchanter or Cleric's Enchanter goes AFK.. either the pet dies or the Enchanter does.  <P>I realize this would be an extremely powerful spell.  Perhaps as a downside the pet can't be buffed or healed.  <P>Charms always been a hassle, that's the downside.  After 60 levels of hassle, there should be a reward and it's NOT DICTATE.<P>---<P>Zamtil Litmaz<BR>Fires of Heaven, Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok lets see...this is stuff I can think of off the top of my head, included are some things that I know probably have no chance but I figure I would bring them up at least with a bit of justification.  I also typed this up ahead of time so if there are any repeats I humbly apologize.<P>1) Illusions crossing zones should stay in tact - invis and ITU do this so coding to keep it in tact exists I would imagine.  as a sidenot I think rogues should be able to sneak across zone lines also it makes sense with these other spells.  OK  logically why would an illusion fade when one walks through a tunnel or across a zone line  that as far as the actual world is concerned doesnt really exist. As an interesting effect of this some peeps might forget to remove their illusion and try to walk into that good aligned city as a werewolf hmmm...would kinda be amusing I think as well as make you have to stop and think<P>2) Group faction spells possibly - "Hey who are those peeps with that hip looking enchanter chic?!"  Think about it  people make assumptions based on people they are associated with, if an enchanter is viewed a certain way by an NPC wouldnt it follow that they would in turn maybe think something better of the people who are with them?<P>3) Do I even want to bring up about enchanting weapons and such?...hmmm naw...how bout an alternative...being able to recharge items with effects that use charges...I dont know if you can do this so it wouldnt be able to be used on potions  and the like thus infringing on shamans but there are some iutems that I think should be able to be recharged.  Or maybe even make this option open to many classes and each class has the ability to recharge certain items usable by certain classes...dunno how or if it could be done though.<P>4) something...anything about stacking meses...whether its allowing the higher level single meses to overwrite the AOE or even being able to recast mes over another chanters mes would be great...I know you can do it if your higher but it makes grouping iwth other chanters a real hassle in large situations...especially when the other chanter may not be quite as timely as you are on renewing meses.<P>5) I noticed in the cleric thread a discussion about the cost of peridots...make the component cheaper for Rune 4 please...10 plat more for only 100hps over rune 3 is a joke at that level its gone before you know it anyways half the time.  Not sure about how cost effective the spel is after that level  anyone with any experience with it please comment...and heck at least the clerics HPS still stay  when a rune is gone..its GONE bam bam bam  10plat goes bye bye.<P>6) Ok new illusions..but something useful perhaps...Velious illusions...giant coldain etc,maybe even some sort of little dragon,  something that will give the masters of mental manipulation that communicating edge  they were designed for that we have in every other city except for those we may have completely trashed and velious.  and yeah I kow we have benevolence and all but we also have access to racial modifiers for the other cities.<P>Aianai W-pi <BR>46th chanter <BR>Order of teh Silver Rose<BR>Quel server<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There is an advantage to illusions dropping at zones. I often use an elemental illusion while fighting, and I like to keep myself bound in town.

</FONT><HR>Manasieve – I’d like to see an upgrade on this spell so we could be more useful in the Final Battle against the bossmob raids. (Many aren’t fully convinced of its current usefulness but perhaps with an upgrade it can be seen.)<P>Defense – I think the defense cap needs to be raised for Enchanters so they could survive long enough to get a heal from a cleric. Other options might be to place much more high AC – high hitpoint items in the game that Enchanters could wear. <P>Rune IV – The component is entirely too expensive for this particular spell. It should be decreased to that of a Pearl or something similar.<P>Illusions – Um, more please. We are illusionists according to our title at level 51. A post 50 illusion or two would be quite nice. <P>Spirit Wolf Illusion – Should be allowed indoors.<P>Lull line – The entire line of spells is useless because its resist rate is too high.<P>Group Buffs – Although these wouldn’t be used much in large raid events it would be very nice to get more group buffs that last as long as the single target buff use a fair amount of mana, yet buff the whole group. <BR>-	Group Augmentation around level 50 would be more than appropriate.<BR>-	Group Umbra at 60.<BR>-	Group Rune 3 somewhere perhaps or Group Rune V at 60?<BR>-	Group Invisibility<P><BR>Limitations on Mez – In Velious there are lots of situations where limitations on Mez don’t seem to make much sense. You can’t Mez the wolves inside Kael Drakkal. They are all tagged with the Giant Flag. I’m ok with not being able to Mez giants, but there dogs? I’m ok with Velious being a much harder continent to fight in, however I hate to see the usefulness of Enchanters diminished close to that of just a buffer while in Velious.<P>There are also limitations inside the Hole that are setup because the Hole is in the Old World. These artificial limitations need to be removed in The Hole to allow Enchanters to Mez mobs. (There have been lots of other threads that more fully explain this Hole issue. Pun intended.)<P>As a final note, I am pleased that the vials of mana line is being used in the game even if the use is limited. And thanks for doing these talks.<P>Neathon Inamorto<BR>52nd Enchanter<BR>The Tribunal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have some unique things to say and some clear explanations  I have read most of the other threads.<P><BR>~~~<P>High level Velious, common problem of lack of crowd control:<P>Our favorite role and the one we come to appreciate as the hallmark of our class is Crowd Control.  In high level Velious encounters this is no longer an option due to Magic Resistant or Unmezzable mobs.  <P>Without crowd control we can debuff.  However, all of our debuffs are magic based so in the case of MR mobs we can only buff.  We are still desired for buffs alone in groups, but it strips our defining role from high level encounters.<P>I would suggest a mostly unresistable extremely mana intensive, low-duration, long-recast mez that could perhaps be used to hold 1 maybe 2 mobs.  Even this would significantly improve our Velious role and I would not see it as deeply imbalancing to those encounters.  We are not asking to mez boss mobs.<P>~~~<P>Linkdeath and Illusions:<P>Here's why they fail when going LD.  Unlike Invisibility Illusions have a set duration, which is a great thing.  In exchange for this set duration Illusions collapse when you zone.  Unfortunately, as a side-effect of this dropping while zoning Illusions also drop when linkdead sometimes placing the enchanter in an instant-death situation  (ie. illusioned dark elf going LD at wood elf guards, yes it happened to me).  As I understand it, out-of-game risk is not desired by Verant.  <P>I don't know if the linkdeath issue could be coded separately from the zoning issue.  If not, Abashi once suggested that illusions could be set to random like Invis.  I highly disagree with this option and would rather have the spells stay as is.  (I don't go LD very often)<P>~~~<P>New Illusions<P>I disagree that enchanters only want utility illusions.  I still want fun ones too  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Here are some current possibilities from the global file:<P>Illusion Eye of Zomm (fun and self explanitory, maybe have it give see-invis)<P>Illusion Animation (makes your body disappear except for what you hold in your hands, just like an enchanter pet or the shadowed men)<P>Illusion: Transmute  (Random Giant Item)  (use any droppable item graphic, bag, coin, dagger, sword, stein, except have the size factor increased.  Hehe a giant stein of Moggok! Giant Platinum Coin!)<P>~~~<P>Group illusions.<P>I think it would be great if our elemental illusions would have a group form.<P>IE.  Group illusion water elemental: gives enduring breath to the party<P>IE.  Group illusion air elemental: gives levitate to the party<P>IE.  Group fire elemental: Gives a small damage shield to the party<P>IE.  Group earth elemental: Gives a minor strength boost to the party<P>~~~<P>Lull series.  The resistance rates on these spells make them not worth using.  I'm not exaggerating, I'll explain.<P>The lull series is only useful on a camp of 3 mobs or more.  If there are only 2 mobs it is very easy to just mez one instead of using lull.  <P>So, say I approach a camp of 3 that I wish to pull 1 out of.  Mez will not help me since casting it once will aggro the other two, so I try lull.  Well, lull must stick on 2 of the 3 mobs in order for my tactic to be effective.  Yet, with a high resist rate it is almost guaranteed that lull will NOT stick on at least one of my two attempts.  <P>If we can't cast singly-target lull spells twice without a huge possibility of resisting then they are useless.  Maybe they are redundant enough that this is okay and the line of spells shouldn't exist to begin with.  I can see that.<P>~~~<P>I believe that concludes my thoughts for enchanters, except for PVP / AE issues which I'll save for PVP Talk (which I hope to follow the resolution of class talks  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> )<P>Inkantra Inkandesence</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Enchanters are, on the whole, pretty well balanced, and are even in demand for groups (but not so much at lower levels).  But remember... enchanters die more often than any other class and level slower than most.  Don't go thinking everything's just fine.<P>I have a long list, despite your plea.  My list includes 32 concerns.  You'll notice that only the first few have to do with balance against other classes, more are balance against the NPCs, and most are non-balance issues or bugs.  It's important to list those too because we don't want them to be forgotten before the big freeze.  Many of these are not my original ideas, but concerns brought up recently on enchanter message boards.<P><BR>Three actual balance issues:<P>The Tashania line should have less taunt and more effect.  Unnerf these spells enough so that enchanters can reduce MR more than shamans.  Compare both the taunt and the effect to the shaman spells... I dare ya.  Maybe Tashan should reduce MR by a percentage instead of a fixed amount.  This has special importance on PvP servers.<P>Too many high level creatures(53+) are immune to charm and mez, especially in Velious. <P>Our pet spells at 34 and 39 are too weak. The pets at other levels may or may not be balanced, but these two are worse than the rest.<P><BR>Three class jealousy issues:<P>We want the ability to both give and take mana from groupmates.  It seems like some class ought to be able to 'heal' mana in the same sense that clerics heal health.  Currently necromancers do that better than enchanters... which just doesn't seem right.<P>Enchanters need armor with more AC (and HP). We need it more than necros need flayed skin armor (and certain other items with AC tuned to shadowknights but still usable by necros).<P>Enchanters should get Invert Gravity too.  We get Gravity Flux ten levels before wizards but never get the upgrade.<P><BR>Two things still missing:<P>The ability to create (and perhaps recharge) magic weapons and armor and wands and such.  Here's one idea: craftable items with one charge of illusion, tradable but expensive to make.<P>More illusions. Many ideas on this, and not just what you think.  Targeted or group illusions instead of self-only would seem natural.  I'd particularly like to be able to choose which face I get (and perhaps what type of armor I seem to have) when I illusion to one of the player races.<P><BR>One great idea:<P>Manashield buff: when this is up damage comes out of mana first, then HP comes off normally once you're out of mana.  The potential benefit is high, but so is the risk.<P><BR>Six spell lines that suck:<P>Lull line. It may have been too powerful in beta, but it's too weak now. Enchanters, being the only class with an uncommandable pet, will find pulling almost impossible unless they play without their pet. So an enchanter already has to make a tradeoff to even use these spells. Perhaps that gives you a little leeway to make these spells more useful, without considering it unbalancing?<P>Whirl/Dyn's/Largarn's. Once upon a time (long ago) these were found to be overpowered. So they were made essentially useless. Isn't there anything in between? Maybe you could replace these with the cleric's line of stun spells. Clerics actually complain about their stuns, but it'd still be better than this line of spells.<P>Taper Enchantment. Not the whole line, just this one particular spell. Its only purpose is to confuse the young enchanters. Don't improve it, don't fix it, don't replace it, just delete it from the game. Please.<P>Thicken Mana line.  There still isn't any use for these.<P>Weakness spell lines. They just aren't powerful enough.  When we talk about stat buffs and debuffs we always end up talking about shamans more than enchanters, and that's only proper.  But still... these spells are too weak as is.  Languid Pace and the other attack-slowing spells are so much better.  In fact, we ought to have at least one debuff (other than attack-slowing) that's actually worthwhile... something stronger than the Cripple spell perhaps.<P>Gift line.  Actually, they don't suck.  But they cost way too much mana.<P><BR>Seventeen things that just don't work quite right:<P>Higher level mez spells should overwrite the lower level mesmerizes (especially the AE mesmerization).<P>Charm spells should have a minimum duration. This one little change might transform charm from a soloing spell to a grouping spell. Really consider this.<P>Make charm more group-friendly 2: Not to make the spell more powerful per se, just a little more convenient. How many seconds does a pet class have to wait after issuing /pet back off before he can issue the next /pet attack command? It should take just as long for a charmed mob to get its bearings when charm wears off.<P>Make charm more group-friendly 3: A visible indication that a mob is charmed... perhaps the name above its head should change to a different color.<P>Yet another charm change: There should be a /pet command that ends the charm, so we can stop casting invisibility on ourselves to break charms.<P>The 'charm wears off' message is sometimes sent a LONG time after the charm has worn off, even after the creature is dead sometimes.<P>Reoccuring Amnesia spell: Doesn't reoccur.<P>Boon of the Clear Mind (group clarity) should overwrite Clarity.<P>The level 59 spell Umbra gives exactly the same amount of AC for the same duration as the level 49 spell Shadow.  They can't both be right.<P>Tiny daggers still aren't sold at the magic guild(s) in Qeynos.<P>It's too hard to target particular creatures when there are several crowded together. We need more targeting features. For a start, perhaps you could show the _01 number at the end of a mob name so we know which one we're aimed it. This actually is an enchanter issue... most everyone else can use /assist.<P>Some spells (Lull series and stuns against giants are primary examples) give the same message on failure that they do on success.  If it fails it should say so.<P>It shouldn't even be possible to cast Mez spells on giant-flagged creatures... it should just not cast rather than cast-and-fail.<P>Religion faction adjustment can never be hidden, not even by illusion. Seems like it should be possible... then maybe enchanters wouldn't have to be 99% agnostic.<P>Cantana (a bard song) and Clarity should either stack or not stack... either let us cast clarity while the song is still playing or don't let them stack at all.<P>Faction hits on some PvP servers make certain very important enchanter quests impossible... fix the quests.<P>On PvP servers illusions drop when casting an offensive spell. Fix the bug and remove this 'temporary solution'.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>For your right now the only things I can come up with off the tope of my head are the following:<P>1) A new Mezmerization Spell around Lvl 51 for use on Giants and the Like. Right now anything large we cannot Mezmerize. Would make us affective once again in SoV<P>2) Give us the promised Item Enchantments we were once told we would have. We are Enchanters. It may take a while and be severely difficult to do but We should be able to enchant great Weapons and Armors. We should be the only class to "Enchant" we shouldnt be the only class though to craft them.<P>3) More Illsuions. I am a long proponent of Illusion:Rat. There are several places with small cracks I would love to be able to poke my head into. Illusion:Giant Should also be one.<P>4) Equipment: There is just not enuff armor that gives Both +Cha and +Int. There is plenty that gives +Int and thats good for the classes that need +Int. Enchanters need both. Also we need higher AC armors since we get smacked around more then say a Wizard or a Mage or even a Necro on a raid. Clerics and Enchanters are about tied on getting the Smackdown.<P>4) Well since I am rambling. Why not make our Epic not require to Kill Cazic.. That will never happen for most unless you are in an Ubber Guild and waiting in a very long line.<P>Just some ramblings</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>After reading most of the posts something I would like to add to my post. <P>Gear. As Forlove posted, whom ever designed high end chanter gear doesn know chanters very well. <P>For example, Resplendent Trousers, Plane of Growth. You would think that since it plane armor it would be good. NOT. As a chanter, I look for cha, then mana, then int, then vs mr, then vs other stuff.<P>AC: 7<BR>+4 STA, +3 CHA, +2 FR, +1 DR, +2 CR, +3 MR, +1 PR<P><BR>They have a +3 cha. Thats it +3.<P>I currently have Drake hide leggings I bought for 25pp. They come from a 29 lvl mob in sol a- the bartender. It has a +5 cha. Hmm, for chanters, what is better? Yes, I know there are some plusses on the plane armor, but I dont know it I would give up my drake hide legging for plane armor. That should be a stupid statement. But its not.<P>Another example. Resplendant Wristguard<BR>AC: 4<BR>+5 AGI, +2 INT, +20 MANA, +1 FR, +1 DR, +2 CR, +2PR<P>I dont see cha there at all. hmmm. Well should I give up my + 7 CHA bracers I have for a +20 mana item? I dont think so. Yes, I know I would get about 14 ac from it after agi adjustments, but I am a chanter, I need cha. So I wont give up my Cats Eye Agate Gold Bracer that I made myself when I was lvl 24 for plane armor. Does this sound right? <P><BR>One more example. Resplendent Gloves<BR>AC: 5<BR>+9 AGI, +9 INT, +35 MANA, +2 CR, +2 DR, +2 FR, +1 MR, +2 PR<P>These look GREAT. ac 5, agi 9 = about 30 ac boost 9 Int, 35 mana. <P>But where is the cha? I dont see any. These would be fantastic for Wizards or Mages or Necros, but for chanters? They are nice, but plane armor should have SOME pluses to the primary attr.<P>Again Plane stats but not plane stats for chanters<P>Cha items are very hard to come by, very hard.<P>Dunar Firestalker<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>I play on Tallon Zek.  My ideas touch on both PvP and PvE.  Over 95% of the time, I am or have been in a group.<P>pre-40:  Looking back on my early years (PvE & PvP), I would have to say most of my time was spent figuring out my class.  To be honest, I feel that the enchanter class is a little overpowered in the early levels.  But I didn't realize that until I figured out how to play an enchanter, which was around 40th level.  Of course, in PvP, other classes realized how to handle an enchanter.  It simply takes more MR to beat an enchanter.  So I think today there is a MR problem, that wasn't there when I was a young enchanter.<P>40-50:  In PvE, the enchanter is right on par, though a few things could be changed.  In PvP, most players have a MR far and above 100.  During this stage, you can win, but you lose far more.<P>Post-50:  Modifications are needed for the enchanter for both PvE and PvP.  Most of my suggestions below are for the post-50th enchanter.<P><BR>1. PvP<P>I realize the PvP community is small, but we have been growing in size.  More and more players from the other servers come to the PvP servers every week.  Here are my suggestions to change the enchanter class:<P>- Magic Resistance    This is a huge problem for enchanters.  It's fine that the magic line is our only line of spells. But MR is the easiest to raise with equipment.  I come across people that have 150+ MR, even some that are above 200 MR.  I have troubles having a spell stick when a person has an MR around 100 (after tashania).  Our spells are resisted way to often.  I suggest the following:<P>-- Modify MR Tables:  I would suggest that the Magic Resistance tables be adjusted.  I don't expect to mez all the time.  But I would expect (at 50th level) to be able to mez a person at the same level with a 100 MR (level*2), 50% of the time.  Then adjust it from there for higher MR and level, but don't be so drastic.  I still should have a 20% chance to mez a 58th level with a MR at 150.<P>-- Change Tashania/Tashanian:  Modify these with higher MR reduction, only for PvP.  I would suggest 45 for Tashania and 65 for Tashania.<P>-- Partial Damage:  Other classes are able to do partial damage, not enchanters.  It's either all or nothing.  This would be fine, but we are resisted far to often.<BR> <BR>- Illusions are dropped in PvP:  It will probable never be changed, but I'm going to list it.  To get behind enemy lines can be a very fun and tactical way to battle.  It's a shame that illusions were modified.  I wish Verant would have spent more time on fixing the problem, instead of a quick fix.<P>- Fear and Charm:  These were removed for a good reason.  They shouldn't be returned to PvP, unless they have a major overhaul to them.  Like the ability to charm other pets.<P><BR>2. Exisisting Spells<P>-Mez and charm in Velious:  There are far to many monsters that are un-mezzable or un-charmable (post-50) in Velious.  I can understand that I can't stun a large monster.  But not being able to actually control them, really has changed my outlook on Velious.  I'll go there to help out my guild for a quest item, but it's just not worth my time.  My role in groups, has been stripped from me in Velious.  My main role should be to control crowds.<P>-Reoccurring Amnesia. This spell is broken. It doesn't reoccur. It should be one of our most used spells, but it gathers dust in my book.<P>-Blanket of Forgetfulness. This spell is supposed to be unresistable, but it's not. It has a huge casting cost, annoying message to everyone around the area and it just doesn't have the effect it's suppose to have.<P>-Glamour of Kintaz/Rapture  These spells are resisted to much.  Even though they are suppose to be a low resist mez.  They should be modified.<P>-Gift spell line. These spells are to expensive for what they give. Either lower the casting cost, longer duration, give more mana and/or give +1/2/3 for mana regen. If you modify Gift of Magic, then I would raise it to a higher level, maybe 44th.<P>-Umbra. The AC addition is to low. It really needs to be raised.<P>-Wind of Tishian/Wind of Tishini. With large number of monsters, this will have everything aggro on you.  It's an ultimate death wish. Maybe change it so that it doesn't aggro those affected or change Blanket of Forgetfulness.<P>-Dictate. Should be raised to charm those at 60th.<P>-Rune 4. The gem cost for this buff is not worth it at the level you obtain it. Once I got Rune 4, I never used it. It was more effective to use Rune 3. Maybe change the gem to something cheaper. <P>-Boon of Clear Mind. This spell is not used much. The spell is useful for 2 levels and most of the time, on raids, there is another enchanter around with Clarity 2. This spell should be changed to a 49th level spell.<P>-Illusions. Illusions should hide religion. Plain and simple. <P>-Clarity 2. Others say to lower it to level 52.  I don't agree with that.  I think it's a huge compliment to get it at 54.  This spell shouldn't be changed.<P>-Charm:  Change the title on the charmed target.  Also give a 1 second message before the charm breaks.<P>3. New Spells<P>-Give mana spell:  Necro's can give there hps to another.  We should be able to give our mana to others.<P>-Illusions.  The illusions we have now are good enough.  Unless there is a need to have factions in the Velious cities, we really don't need new illusions.<P>-Group Haste:  Would be a good addition at later levels.<P>4. Equipment<P>-Rune 4 on Resplendent Robe.  I feel that the Effect should be Rune 5.<P>-Crystal Crown of Confusion/Crystal Rod of Confusion. Casting time on the effects is almost not worth it.  I would suggest cutting the casting time on them.  If there are other items like this, please consider those as well.<P>5. Misc<P>-Pets:  The pets don't need to be modified.  They do their purpose just fine.  The only thing I would suggest is giving us a /pet release command.<P>-Feign Death:  I can't believe people are actually suggesting this modification.  I have suggested other means to help, that are more in line with our class.<BR>	<P>Ellaar Earbiter<BR>52nd level Enchanter <BR>Tallon Zek<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Neurosiis Niakkard<BR>60 Phantasmist<BR>The Rathe Server<BR>Blood of the Spider<P>First of all, let me commend you all on these "Talk" threads.  I find them to be a huge step<BR>in a pleasant direction for everyone.  Even if nothing is changed directly because of them,<BR>their sheer existence at least reveals an apparent concern on VI's part.<P>I really enjoy playing my Enchanter.  I've always liked the "control/status" type magic, and<BR>I think this class does a good job at such.  However, there are a few things that I think<BR>Enchanters lack which we really should have.<P>The biggest problem with Enchanters has always been available gear.  It's always been a lame<BR>fact about the way VI groups and handles all INT casters as if to suppose their roles are<BR>all identical.  Each class' role is different, and accordingly, each class should have gear<BR>(and skills) available to it which compliments this role.  I believe this effort is carried<BR>out for just about all classes, but it certainly is not considered for the Enchanter class.<BR>Enchanters need gear which gives higher AC and HP, than other INT casters'.  You might even<BR>consider upping the defense skill cap for enchanters.<BR>Sarnak Bracer of Honor?  Great item... why was it apparently removed immediately?<P>In more recent times, we Enchanters have been highly let down with the lack of new content<BR>(as in, new, usefull content) which has come with the expansions.  From RoK, we only gained<BR>a couple new spells (Boltran's Agacerie and Theft of Thought, all I can think of...rest are<BR>all minor upgrades, and many totally useless) which hold any practical usage and benefit and<BR>some ALL/ALL gear which is better than Insidious for Enchanters.  From SoV, we got even<BR>less.  There are only 2 SoV spells I have mem'd since scribing: Enchant Velium and Boon of<BR>Garou... don't even mention the Gift of ... line of spells, anyone who posed half an<BR>analysis of that spell could conclude that it's retarded.  And, of course, all the Enchanter<BR>class gear which came with SoV is pathetic (PoG gear? sux... robe is mildy acceptable but<BR>still a huge let down).  To top it off, you make gear (Flayed Paebala) accessible to<BR>Necromancers (who already had better gear available to them than Enchanters) in SoV which<BR>TOTALLY blows away ANY gear that was ever wearable by INT casters (Including Golden Efreeti)<P>I was really hoping VI would give Enchanters some cool, new spells with SoV.  Below, is a<BR>list of some of the spells I thought would have been nice.<P>Silence -- just like Ail from PoG has, only single target of course<BR>suggest: resistance check - Magic (every 30 seconds), mana - 250, duration - 2 min (max,<BR>variable, like root), recast time - 12 sec, cast time - 5 sec, will not take hold over<BR>itself and does not interrupt current casting<P>Enthrall 2 -- Fast casting mesmerise line spell<BR>suggest: duration, recast time, resist check same as Enthrall; mana 100, cast time - 1.5 sec<P>Intoxicate -- induces drunken effect on target, just as if target drank lots of alcohol<BR>suggest: similar stats to Curse of the Simple Mind<P>Phase -- same ability phase spiders get in Dragon Necropolis<BR>suggest -- similar stats to Shadow Step<P>Anti-Magic Aura -- Invulnerability to all magic (even friendly), short duration, self only<BR>suggest: cast time - 2 sec, duration - 20 sec, recast time - 20 min, reagent - opal<BR>possibly, though I'd rather not have this, it first strips caster of all enchantments<P>Illusion Gender -- male/female<P>Doppelganger -- Take on form of random regular zone mob but without the faction relatation.<BR>Make it so faction is unaltered by this spell.<P>None of these spells would be too powerful, I don't think.  The only thing that I can think<BR>of which would need specific tuning would be the need to make the Chardok King and Queen<BR>immune to silence  (and any other caster-type Boss mobs without "dragon" resist magic).<P>In summary, I mostly want to see Enchanters get some more appropriate gear which compliments<BR>our role in this game, and I would like to get some new spells.  I would mostly like to see<BR>a fast Enthrall and a silence spell.  If anything, having these new spells would increase<BR>the difficulty of the Enchanter class, because then, we'd have to wrack our brains to decide<BR>what to demem in order to mem one of these spells.<P>Thank you for listening and for this opportunity to express some of my feelings on my class.<P>In Your World,<BR>Neurosiis Niakkard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 16 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-11.html">11</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-12.html">12</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-13.html">13</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-14.html">14</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-15.html">15</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-16.html">16</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052139&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052139&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
