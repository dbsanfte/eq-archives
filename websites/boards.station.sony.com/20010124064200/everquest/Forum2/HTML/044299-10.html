</FONT><HR> Ok ok ok ok..O-K.<P> If we as Necros are supposed to be mana batteries, I can live with that. If giving mana to the cleric will allow me to gain a right to be in a the roll and be a part of the prestige of killing and uber mob, then fine, I can live with that. And if Verant will not allow taps to land on these uber mobs so that we can regain our mana to pass off, ok heres an idea.<P>Enchanters are gonna hate me for this...<P>Give us a spell that taps mana. It wouldnt unbalance the game in my opinion. You would be doing no damage to the mob itself other than taking its mana away. Make it a DoT like Bond of Death where mana is gained at a greater speed, oh and make it so that its not a 100% resist. This way we dont have to worry about landing lifetaps or draining our mana down to nothing and just sitting there. We suck mana, we pass mana to other casters...there. We now have a more efficient and active roll, even if it is completely opposite of what our class was supposed to be like. <P>What say ye Verant? Would this be too godlike in your eyes?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>*sigh*  I see not -one- response that addressed what my post said near the top of page 5 (I think it was).<P>I see necros feeding enchanters all the time, not just clerics.  I see necros feeding evaccers occasionally.  That COMPLETELY answers your "Why not just bring another cleric" complaint.  Clerics are -not- the only class that ever needs to be twitched.  The fact that you can feed the appropriate class -when needed- is a tremendous functionality that I wish you people would stop just glossing over.  I really can't take it all seriously at -all- until you admit that that is HUGE.  When you act like NO class other than a cleric could EVER need an emergency boost of mana that would save the whole group, I can't take anything you say seriously at all, and the sad thing is, you're ALL saying that!  C'mon, get real.<P>Qwinn Windfletcher<BR>51st Ranger<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Menil,<P> I know man. I dont WANT to drain mana, and I dont WANT to just be a mana battery. But Verant has pretty much spoken on this. Taps wont get any better on these mobs, and even if they say the DoT/Poof bug is fixed on 55+ mobs...whos gonna test it? Is a guild gonna get together and try this out on Trak, at risk of many peoples deaths and the possible loss of some really great items?<P> If were going to be the square peg in the round hole, at least shave off the corners a bit so it fits a little better. A mana tap spell would at least make our crummy ration transfers a bit easier to swallow. Thus giving us at least a role. <P> I personally dont have a problem with giving mana away on a raid. Its the fact that once my mana is gone, I can do nothing else. I could lich but how do I gain health back? Have the Cleric I just twitched blow his mana on me? Thats redundant and nothing gets accomplished. My stance is if we cannot tap life to keep ourselves alive and able to keep pumping mana, then at least allow us something that will make this process viable.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>well i could write another page..<P>but i think its all been said...<P>one thing i havent seen anyone mention when they say how useful it is that i can give my worthless mana to the cleric or wizzie. Alot of these epic encounters are limited seating due to LDs. When its decided who will go and what groups to form you better choose wisely. I can see no reason under the sun WHY you would take more than one necro. Ecspecially now that wizzies n clerics are being nerfed too, and arent doing their job like they used to.<P>my necro is retired.<P>Krystina Atra'Exosus<BR>52nd Heretic, MT<BR>~~lost deep within in the shadows~~<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Might I suggestion something on the corpse poof issue. You keep saying 55+ mobs will not poof. Well in Hate, Fear, Air, Hole, Etc raid zones there are things that do *poof* that have the potential for desireable items and are NOT 55+, thus we do not want them to poof. So reconsider the 55+ part, make it (IMHO) 47+ or at least 50+. Re-evaluate the 55+ mark, Cause not every epic/raid mob is 55+.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I dont know why but as a warrior I can get every pet on me on single second. Tricks on how to aggro a pet in seconds. In a fight while the pet is fighting switch targets to the pet by accident most of the time. The Pet almost always argos. You then yell get your pet off me..pet backs off. Then do it again the second tiem the pet might not aggro. Also it always happens in bad times long fights and never while you are just sitting around. The pet will agro you if you hit taunt and have auto attack during a fight with a group wailing on the mob. Then also if the pet is still mad at you and the pet is not named goner if the caster goes LD you will be killied by the pet unless the group kills the pet. If anyone wants to verify this They can. There was one time that I had two pets on me at one time. I have a problem with switching targets by accident and not realising it. Just do it at the start of a battle have the caster send in the pet switch to pet leave auto attck on and taunt the pet will aggro you no problem during the fight while the caster is there on non pvp servers.

</FONT><HR>Absor...<P>While this may not have been what youre looking for, but since youre paying attention to this thread....<P>A couple weeks ago, we had the Maestro of Rancor poof on us. Maestro is not L55+, but I would still certainly consider him a raid level mob, given that he's more of a pain in the butt than Innoruuk. The situation was thus...<P>Whole lot of people nuking the bloody hell out of him, whole lot tanks swinging.... and then one tank goes LD. L50 Ogre Warrior, solid tank, good damage, but certainly is not going to outdamage the L60 warrior, or myself (l56 warrior) or any of the wizard who said 'oooo pretty!' and let loose on Superfreak.<P>He gets the killing blow.<P>Corpse goes poof.<P>Up until the epic quests went live, I could sincerely have given a damn, since most of his loot rots now. However, he has a drop for the warrior epic quest, and it's fairly rare... so having a corpse poof like that is not cool on a 24 hour spawn.<P>Whatever code you have in place to prevent L55+ mobs from poofing, please consider moving it down to L50+ or at the least l53+<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think everyone is very overheated about this.  Everyone has a role to play in a group or alone or on a super-raid.  I have played all the race/necro combonations out there, and I enjoyed them all.  At first I played a necro because I heard they were a great solo class.  Afterwards, I learned how to play in a group.  I indeed know how to play multiple types of necro's.  I don't mean race/class, I mean group/solo.  I think that if someone wants something that requires killing that level 55 dragon, they better use their grouping capabilities, and do as the group says.  After all, that robe of decay in Veeshan's peak is for YOU!  If you're not part of the support team in there, you die.  Know your role.  Experiment, and DEAL with it.  I hear people saying "I wanted to be the damage dealer."  You're not the wizard, the warrior, the monk... you're an undead-wanna-be.  Give your hit points away.

</FONT><HR>I don't play a high level Necro, just some low/mid level ones.  Just want to get a handle on all of the arguments, so if someone can sanely reply I'd appreciate it.<P>Lifetaps not landing on "boss" raid mobs-<P>From what I understood based upon the SK HT resistances which are on the lifetap resist table (unless you use the discipline), and I may be wrong, Lifetaps are not 100% resistable by all uber mobs, they are just appear to be so highly resistant that the number of times they have to be cast to have chance of landing something renders them effectively unusable in practice.  Pulling some numbers out of my rear, in theory 90% resistance means that 10% not resisted which may look viable, but not in practice on the battlefield what with casting times, mana consumption and whatnot.  This may be a difference between Developer and Player view.<P>Increasing mana transfer ratios would double the Necro's mana pool -<P>It would not double the Necros mana pool, but if the efficiency is doubled, then the effect is that they can transfer twice as much mana, similar effect as doubling the mana pool if the mana pool is devoted to mana transfer functions.<P>Verant's stance seems to be that while you are not that good at mana transfer or with healing but you can do something to contribute to the effort.  If you develop friends they will take you with them even if you are not the most effective.<P>Players stance is that if we are not that effective, in raid situations they don't take 3rd raters so being bad at something for those situations is effectively in practice the same as not doing it at all.  Having to rely on being friends with the Raid leaders just to get the chance to be ineffective sucks rocks.<BR>  <BR>Dots not stacking -<P>Only one can be cast on a creature, making more than one necro in an encounter less useful.  This also affects other DoT casting classes, not just necros.  On the other hand if you allowed more than one dot to stack, while not bad with one or two used in a "normal" group combat scenario it, could scale up to be abusive pretty easily with some creative thinking.<P>Perhaps instead, create some DoTs that do more damage in the early stages and trail off in damage and overall be less effective than consistant damage spells.  This would allow others casting the same spell and overwriting to be more useful, eg 100 damage on get go, 50 damage 1st tick 25 2nd, 12.5 3rd, etc.  That way if someone else casts again after the second tick and overwriting, they are still adding to the damage instead of just increasing spell duration.<P><BR>Pet effectiveness -<P>Sure they die quickly to AoE high level mobs, but who in melee range doesnt?  Wizards have to be in melee range in order to land a Lure spell and they are probably less equipped to handle the damage than pets but they contribute somehow.  For the small time that the pets are there they can help fill the hate list and do some minor damage.  Pathing can still be a problem if your pet is feared.<P>Corpse Poofing -<P>It may have been "fixed" for level 55 and above, but since reimbursals for poofed mob corpses arent reimbursed, not many people want to take a chance on this and I don't know anyone who will go through all the effort just to test it out, especially as proper testing requre multiple attempts for different scenarios, let alone repeats of the same scenario to be 100% certain.  It still is not "fixed" for lower level mobs.  Corpses of high level mobs still seem to "poof" perhaps for other reasons not fixed, perhaps LD members getting the killing blow, dead or LD members's dots or pets doing killing damage or what have you.<P>On a side note, while Warlock is sexed as male and Sorceress the female counterpart, Heretic is a unisex title.  They do need to have male/female titles but no need to weaken a valid point by making up words like Hereticess.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor:<BR>I think there are a few things that you need to re-evaluate. I’ll explain my understanding of things and we can see what you think you need to look at. <P>Issue 1: The necro’s role on a raid.<BR>People are claiming that the only role of a necro on a high level raid is as a mana battery. This would be fine with me if we were able to do that job properly. As it stands a necro cannot use lich while fighting a big monster to keep his own mana up because he cannot tap the creature. The necro is no longer a good mana battery and after he dumps all of his mana he is certainly less than useful. I think you need to get rid of high-level creatures immunities to lifetaps. With Velious you have breached the 32k HP limit. The damage that a necro or even a group of them can do with lifetaps is only a small portion of the life of the new creatures. Kunark is a different story though. The boss mobs die so fast that necros (and I’m sure some other classes as well) don’t have any real need to be there. This is of course a problem that you have fixed with Velious (and thank you very much for that, 15 second boss mob fights are borrrrrrrring), but even in Velious MOB MR is ridiculous.<P>Issue 2: The tools of the trade.<BR>A necro has a lot of tools at his disposal. We have pets, DoTs, DD, mana and HP exchanges for self and for others. We can summon your corpse and a lot of other fun stuff. Almost none of these skills however are useful during a high level encounter. Lets look at them one by one. <P>Issue 3: Jobober Vs. Uber_Mob_00<BR>Pet are very useful and one of the mainstays of the necro profession. On large raids they become a lot less useful though. Walking a pet through a zone is most times a nightmare. The pet will wander off or agro things through walls that a PC wont agro. Verant may claim that this is a disadvantage to using a pet but that is just a flimsy excuse to call a bug a feature. When you do get to the uber mob it’s either going to fear your pet away or it’s going to kill your pet in the first 10 seconds of the fight from obscenely high damage AoE spells. You’ve now just wasted 500+mana.<P>Issue 4: Damage spells.<BR>Mobs at higher levels get some pretty high resists. When you get into the uber mob category the resists are so obscene that only a lure will go through. Everything else is just wasted mana. The only possible way to hit these things is to debuff them, but unless the debuffers are both level 60 and have the supposedly irresistible debuff your not going to touch them. Lower resists a little bit. Make the susceptible to something. Nagafen/Talendor for example should almost never resist a cold based spells yet he is immune to fire spells. From what I hear though the cold resist is still pretty high.<P>Issue 5: Melee range casting (all casters)<BR>What is it with having to be within melee range to cast on all Boss mobs? Why did you put that in. There is not roleplay reason for that to be in the game and I see no mechanics reason for it either. As for roleplay reason NOT to have it. I’ll be damned if I’m a caster and I’m going to get anywhere near a monster like that. That’s the tanks job. I’ll stand back and nuke it thank you. This is something that I have always been strongly against. Either get rid of it or give casters better defense and AC.<P>Issue 6: Summoning Corpses<BR>This is a non-issue. This has nothing to do with killing an uber mob. This is not parto f what necros are griping about. We want to be more effective DURRING the battle, not after it.<P>Issue 7: Corpse Poofing<BR>Yes it still can happen. Why? Because Verant is paranoid that someone somewhere might come out ahead. Here are the ways that I know a corpse can poof:<P>Scenario 1: The NPC<BR>Any NPC attacking a creature if it gets the last hit will make a corpse go poof. As well if the NPC does the most damage the corpse will poof.<P>Scenario 2: The hate list<BR>Another way for a corpse to poof is for a pet to get the last hit on a mob after the pet’s owner has been knocked off the hate list. The hate list used to be so short that people who were not constantly casting or hitting the mob would be bounced off the list. If a DoT or a pet kills the NPC while the casters is off of the hate list the game assumes that it was killed by an NPC…POOF<P>Scenario 3: NPC mode, fear, linkdeath and other “features”<BR>The other way to poof a corpse is for your PC to become an NPC. If for some reason the game thinks that you’re an NPC and you get the last hit. *POOF*. How can this happen? First off as soon as you get feared the game considers you an NPC (a BIG mistake on Verants part in my opinion) So now if you have a DoT on the mob and the DoT kills the mob while your feared POOF! If you go linkdead during the fight you become an NPC. Guess what! Yup if your DoT or pet get the last hit the game considers it killed my an NPC. The same of course goes for ALL the melee classes in the fight. I do not want to hear the line about “we do not want linkdeath to be a desirable state” That’s BS. You’ve already given a once over to enough people who lose all their summoned items due to out-of-game issues that should not have as detrimental effects on your in-game time. <P>So far as I know not a one of these has ever been fixed. The hate list was extended but that is just a workaround and not a fix. With all the outdoor uber and semi-uber mobs you will have to deal with scenario 1 a lot more often now. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I think you are misunderstanding the concern of necromancers world-wide.  Let me explain.<P>When I, and I'm sure everyone else, was choosing what class to play, I looked for certain abilities that would suit my style of play.  I found necromancer to be the best.  I enjoyed the high level of independence, ability to solo when your SOL on groups, and ability to contribute a lot to a group by providing an extra tank -- pet, ability to snare mobs and deal damage.  As Kunark, and now Vellous came out, the abilities for which I picked to play a necromancer have been diminished or eliminated.  To compensate for that, we were given other abilities.  While they are great, they are not what I wanted to have my character do.<P>You say that our role is very similar to that of clerics, now that we have the ability to transfer mana.  You say that we are not yet accustomed to that role.  That's not the problem.  People who picked to play a cleric, picked to play a support class.  People who picked a necromancer, picked to play a class that has the ability to do great direct damage over a period of time via dots, pets, lifetaps.  Unlike clerics who PICKED to sit on their ass and heal, necromancers are being FORCED into sitting and feeding.  See the difference?  After 50+ levels, suddenly necromancers are forced to go in a different direction.<P>That being said, I want to say that the mana feed spell is great, and I have saved a raid from wiping out more times than I can count by being able to supply a cleric with mana to heal that last surviving warrior.  I just don't feel like we should be FORCED into that role by making our other spells useless, and be EXPECTED to save mana and feed clerics.<P>Veerus --  Level 55 NeCleric.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I will try to keep most of the heat out of this reply if I can as I would like to make a reasoned point.  I do not play a Necro, but reading your replies to the concerns in this post, I could not help but notice a very disturbing point of view from VI.  Sice it is very obvious that most of the decision makers of this game have not and do not play it as customers do, let me give you the real life scenario.  A customer goes to the store and pays $100 (EQ, Kunark, Velious) for the game. He spends some time playing different classes to get a feel for which best suits his or her style of play and what will give the most satisfaction from the game.  A Necro is chosen.  Now, for the next YEAR AND A HALF, the person works diligently playing his character. Honing his skills as a Necro. Learning his role in groups and on larger raids. Pushing through the tough times of uber camps, ever diminishing character strength vs mobs, and nerfing frustrations. Becuase he believes, like all gamers and role players, that the pinnicle is attained through hardship and hardwork. That if he "just sticks with it" the satisfaction, the payoff, will come.  Now, in reading your post, it was very clear that after all this time and effort, when the person has reached a level in the game where his ROLE should not only be refined to an artform but should be at its most efficient and gratifying, YOU (VI) have pretty mush pulled the rug out from under him.  You said yourself that the Necro's role CHANGES in these larger raids.  So I ask, why? From all that I've read it seems to me that Verant is just being too damn lazy to find a way to let the different classes BE WHAT THEY HAVE WORKED SO HARD TO BE!  Instead, in a lame effort to make top encounters difficult, you "turn off" abilities and strengths like a switch because they would be too usefull in the encounter.  Your "paying" customers deserve better for thier money, time, effort, and loyalty.<BR>Im not saying the big encounters should be easier. I, like most, like that fact that they are difficult.  But not by directly nerfing abilities (therefor uncerimoniously changeing a long held role of a character), but by other means. Like a Dragon spell that causes all spells (even its own) to fizzle for a short time, or a breath spell that freezes half the raid for a short time.  Those type of things would be much easier to swallow becuse they would be "part of the game" and not as "Verant screwing with my class again!".<BR>Comprende?<P>Thanks.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>From the class that redefines itself at every level with every new song: find a way to adapt and be useful.  He mentioned hp to others, try it; he mentioned mana to others, try it; use that skeleton spell later in the game and chime in with the enchanters that if you can't target the mob you shouldn't have to because you should be using /assist themaintank instead.<P>You live behind fear like mages live behind their dirt clods and then you never figure out what every wizard learns the very first time they group: DO NOT OVERNUKE EARLY ON, let the tanks build up some hate then have at it or better yet be the one who nukes the mob into oblivion or nukes it into flee mode.  Darkness is a great DoT and a snare, throw that on a mob instead of making someone snare with no damage or worse yet root.<P>Learn to group like you learned to solo, each group is unique in that you will play a different role depending on what classes encompass that group.  Big raids take learning these things ahead of time, you can't just solo to 50 then run around  as "Highlevel (Dark Elf) 50 necromancer LFG"<P>Kollins the bard who solos and groups.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Furthermore, the skeletal illusion on necromancer DD spells has been removed in an effort to make them raid friendly.<P><BR>There you have it. Done. <P><BR>And for you lower lvl necros worried about your class, the necromancer is an EXCELLENT class all the way through level 60.

You can still level, still have fun, etc.  Raids are just fun events and have nothing to do with your ability to progress post 50.<P>To you few who were pathetic enough to stoop to the "I pay my $10" sniveling - That money just allows you to log on and keep the servers running, it doesnt mean Verant has an obligation to get everyone who plays to 60th.
