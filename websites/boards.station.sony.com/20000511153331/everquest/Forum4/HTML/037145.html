</FONT><HR>The Veeshan server was chosen to be split because it was CONSISTENTLY overpopulated day and night.  An average evening always consisted of 2000+, always.<P>Today was the server split.  "HOORAY!", I thought as I logged on this evening.  "With 1000 people transfered, the population of Veeshan is gonna be tolerable, 1000 maybe 1200 TOPS!"<P>WRONG DEAD WRONG<P>How many are on Veeshan?  Yep 2000+  Did NOBODY sign up to move?  I check the population of the NEW server Veeshan split into with Bristlebane.  750.  750??????<P>If I just transfered to a NEW server I would have logged on to check everything out, get a feel for the new community etc.  So CLEARLY the 1000 people from each server were NOT moved.  It was more like 500 from each.  Pathetic.<P>This did NOTHING to alieviate the INTOLERABLE overcrowding on Veeshan.  Can you PLEASE explain why you said you would split the server and LESSEN the population, yet NOTHING was done?<P>I stick up for Verant ALOT, but you have really disappointed me here.  PLEASE redo the split PROPERLY. Take 1000 PRIMETIME players, not people who log on once a month.  Nothing has changed on Veeshan, its really sad.<P>I really really wanted to come and THANK YOU for doing something about the rampant overcrowding on Veeshan, yet here I am thanking you for nothing.<P>Please look into this.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Same deal on Bertox. Server split was alleged to be today... but I didn't really see _any_ difference in server numbers. As of the time of this post there are still over 2300 people on Bertox (by EQ Vault's server status thingy).<P>I too am curious about this. Both the expansion and the split were intended to lower the server population, weren't they? Or did I miss something along the way?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Take it easy.<P>Same thing happened on Fennin.  After Fennin was split, there was like 650 people TOPS on Druzzil.  Fennin still owned the bottom spot on the list for a few days afterward, since everyone was eager to play in a recently de-popped server (that, and it was finally rid of the Seekers of Norrath.)<P>Now it's usually around 1800-2000<P>BTW, don't forget.

</FONT><HR>Actually, over 1000 people from each server were moved.  However, when we publish that we are taking registrations, invariably people who don't play at peak ask to be moved, as do people who have multiple accounts. Unfortunately, there's no magic way to determine what percentage of those moved represent peak usage.  Population on Veeshan rose to 2800 at the time that we opened registrations, so it's quite evident that many of those who were running the command were not peak users. <P>We'll give it a few more days to stabalize and then may consider moving some more.<P>-Gordon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Thanks for replying Gordon.  Here is a suggestion...<P>Can you make the second server migration an unannounced peak hour event?  It would prevent those who rarely play from planning on logging in and moving, thus skewing the actual population curve on the server. Get the peak users, not the 'once-a-weekers' </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>ABout the above two posts:<P>Splits servers aren't there to make life easy on the people that get moved and keep life the same on the people that didn't.<P>You're saying that life on the new server is great, with hardly any people anywhere.  Life on the server you came from hasn't changed much.  Thats not the way it should work.<P>There should not be a drastic change on one server and very little change on the other.  There should be an equal amount of people on both servers.  That is why they are SPLIT servers.  They are splitting 2 servers off into one new server.<P>This doesn't mean that server a population should be 2000, server b's 2000, and server C-split should be 500.  It means that if the average peak population for A & B are 2500, that the average population of A,B, & C should be around 1750 after the splits.<P>Split servers aren't being popped up just to make a few people happy to be on a server that has a very low amount of people.  If they wanted to do that, they would need to setup ATLEAST 15 more servers, all split servers.  Ratio of atleast 5 to 1, split to new servers.<P>Just be happy you got a split, and that the overcrowding on your server isn't as bad and won't be as bad as before.<P>When over 75% of the servers at peak time are over 2200 players, and only a few can be split, you have no room to complain or argue about how they are split.  It should be even, and if that means moving more becuase there are so few on the new servers, then so be it.<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif">Syn <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif"><BR>*Innoruuk*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Now is everyone gonna whine because not enough other ppl left because they didnt want to take the chance & leave themselves? You dont want to leave your guild/friends/whatever??? Well I didnt either .. it was no easy decision to split but now I should be able to enjoy the benefits & not have my new server crowded as I took the risk to make a change.  I just don't want 2 MORE servers split into Saryrn in order to "fill it up" I dont see that many posts from ppl on Veeshan or Bristlebane from ppl who missed the split or want another chance to split, all I see are ppl crying that not enough ppl left.  With as many ppl on as there were during the split I think there was ample opportunity to go .. furthermore Abashi already stated that there were OVER 2000 ppl moved in the split .. that is enough. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Here's a thought:  You heard that your server would be split.  You thought "Cool, a whole bunch of people will move to the new server, and my old server will be nice and empty for me and my friends."  You chose not to move to the split server.  You logged in after the server split thinking "Cool, all these people have moved, now the server will be underpopulated just for ME!"<P>Guess what?  Most of the people on your old server thought the same thing you did, and chose not to move either.  That is why the peak population of your server is not vastly smaller than it used to be.  Just look at the last time servers were split.  The new(er) servers (I apologize for not remembering the names offhand) are still among the lowest populated at peak times.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ugh, my guild is pretty upset right now.  There seems to be no logic as to who made the move and who didn't.  One of the husband/wife teams that belong to our guild had the wife make it and the husband didn't, even though he moved log the same time she did.  We had another husband/wife team make it after a lot of trouble downloading the patch (I had to email it to them), but they did the movelog 2 hours after 6pm PST.  We had 3 of our officers who didn't make it even though they did /movelog in the first 15 minutes.  Go figure.  We had a brother make it, and his sister didn't.  The overall idea was to reduce the population of Veeshan during peak hours, and all these people are peak hours players, but I have at least one friend who will not play again if he has to start his character over on Saryrn.  No amount of offered powerleveling will get him to do it, and he sure isn't going to play on Veeshan with all his friends on Saryrn.<P>Gonzzo<BR>Officer of Wyrm Bane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I feel bad for those who tried to move and weren't - Verant screwed up again here, since I too remember reading the FIRST 2000, but for those who didn't want to take the risk, stop crying. Things are no different for you now than they were before. Actually, a little better. You still have a couple hundred less people to compete with.

</FONT><HR>Have to disagree.<P>The entire point of the split servers is to alleviate the pressure on the other servers. If the goal of alleviating that pressure has not been accomplished, and there are still people on those servers who want to be moved (as is obvious from a number of these posts), then it needs to be done again.<P>Believe me, I know how those of you on the new servers feel. I can remember a time when Bertoxx only had 600 people on it, and it truly was an amazing time. But, the fact is that reserving a server that was meant to help with overcrowding by limiting it to 600 people at peak is a waste of available resources.<P>Yes, please split the servers again.

</FONT><HR>It seems fair to me to make a new split so everyone gets a less crowded server. It is selfish to want to be one of 500 people on a server and a lot of people have been separated from friends and guild because they took a chance on moving and it appears to have been random rather than the first 1000 people as expected. I am now playing on both servers but am not happy with the situation at all and would appreciate a second split to give people in this situation a fair chance to move again. I have put a lot of work into my 39 character and now I dont know what to do. I have met a lot of people who this happened too and hope  Verant will put things right.<P>Thank you<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
