</FONT><HR>I have noticed one magor issue was left out of absor's post.<P>MAGIC RESISTANCE OF UBER MOBS IS TO HIGH.<BR>This is a problem for all casters and significantly reduces our effectiveness when compaired to tank. It is especialy bad for wizards as nukes are all we have to offer a group or a raid. Resistance needs to be lowered on uber mobs for all caster and wizards should be resisted less than all other casters. I hope this was left out of our post because it is an issue that effects multiple classes and not because EQ dosnt intend to do anything about it.<P>ALSO ANOTHER NOTE ON BONDS OF FORCE. I forgot to mention if bonds of force is nerfed to a single target spell, they should also lower the mana cost and speed up the casting time. By making Bonds of force a single target snare you make quad kiting more difficult, but AoE snars are also very usefull when in a group to slow down a train for excape. Also if you are going to Nerf the Wizards AoE snare you should Nerf the druids as well. If anyone should be able to quad kite it should a wizard not a druid and at the moment druids do it better because they have sow.<P>AoE DAMAGE SPELLS IN GERNERAL NEED A BIG OVER HALL TO MAKE THEM MORE USE FULL NOT JUST ADDING A TARGET TO THE ALKABOR LINE.<BR>AoE spells are not used much period not just the Alkabor line, personaly i have not used one since lvl 30 ( and the only time i did it then was to clear the RR in High Keep. I died in the effort 70% of the time but it was the only way i could get in a group ). If you want ppl to use AoE's more you need to do one of 2 things.<P>1. ) double the damage they do multiply the amount of mana they use 2.5 . If a current AoE dose 216 dmg for 175 mana, it should be changed so it dose 432 dmg and costs 438 mana. The cast and recast times should remain the same and the agro on these spells should also be doubled. By doing this you give the caster a reason to use an AoE, he can now have a cance of killing one mob and doing serious injury to the other surrounding mobs. Even though the spell becomes less efficient the over all value is increased. Currently all AoE's do less than 20% of a blue mobs HP in dmg ( and that is pre Kunark and Velious ) and if a caster uses one it usualy means suicide with out realy helping the group out.<P>2.) Leave the AoEs the way they are but give all casters with AoEs a spell that prevents them from having spells interupted. By doing this you will alow the casters to chain cast multiple AoE even while being attacked( but they would still take the dmg from the attack ). This could also help Casters keep from being killed by a couple of low green con mobs.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, heres a thought...<P>Current spell: Deathpact = Clerics<BR>If target is about to die, random chance the target will be boosted back to half life.<P>Saves the targets life, and they keep fighting (at least, maybe for a little longer anyway)<P>Idea for wiz version (no, not exactly the same)<BR>Deathport (corny isn't it?) <BR>If target is slain, random chance they are instead gated back to their bind spot instead, at 1hp stripped of all buffs.<BR> <BR>Not useful in all circumstances, in actuality fairly few. It mainly could be used for enchanters, since often if the enchanter eats it, the groups gonna die anyway (same w cleric)<P>May help group factor a bit, if we can give ppl a chance at saving their butt and not having to wait for res and res effects.<P>May not be useful for tanks of course, but its not meant to be used on em.<P>Of course, some might rather die than be ported back to their bind spot, so make it a confirm window for the spell to be cast on someone.<BR>Reagent required?

</FONT><HR>I'd like to suggest an idea for this thread.  Wizards should focus on the top 3 issues we have.  Let's worry about the Skyfire Evac, the pointy hats, and nerfing of AE Snare or another day.<P>Concentrate your arguments on:<P>Spell Efficiency (rework how Channeling works)<P>Higher Damage Output (via lower resistances, implementation of spell crits, and removal of level caps)<P>Loot/Gear for Wizard (Wiz only and no drop) that brings about Spell efficiency and damage output.<P>These are my top 3 anyway.  Feel free to offer your top 3 (try to make arguments that change the class from 1 to 60).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>To the mage that posted in this thread, I have a mage that i play and hes fairly high level. Playing a mage is a godsend compared to play a wizard.<P>Where you think you have a problem you can add that problem to wizards also plus remove any benefits you have as of pets or groupfriendly spells, no matter if druids are better in one area, and we end up with wizards being in a MISEARBLE state compared to mages. Wizards only have our damage. We have no other tools And for mages to argue that your spell damage should be comparable with ours even as close as it is now is rediculus as you have your pet that adds free unresistable damage. IT may cost mana to summon but it will do damage while you med that mana back and it will continue to do damage while you nuke a full tank of mana away for massive damage and med again to do the same while the wizard is out of commision for atelast 15 min from the nukes he casted while you summoned your pet and is now totaly useless to the group and already outdamaged by your pet alone.<P>The conclusion of this is that wizards are a mage without pets or groupfriendly spells. Is this balanced? of course not.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Well, both Azmodeus and Dracones have touched on this issue but I don't think it has seen the attention that it deserves.  What I believe is the primary problem with wizards and casters in general is that they do not get better as time goes on.  I do not mean that they do not get better as they get to higher levels.  What I mean is that with the additions of new expansions, new equipment, and new monsters in the game, casters have seen almost no increase in their power over the broad range of levels.<P>Let me begin with an example of how the power of tank types has increased.  When tanks get new weapons, their damage over time in increased.  This means that they can dish out more damage and over all, take less damage since dead monsters deal no damage.  Now, when an expansion is added (Kunark or Velious) new and more powerful weapons are added.  Some may be just as good as currently available weapons but are simply much easier to get at.  Once these are in the game, trickle down theory takes over.  Many people start getting the new item and the old ones are sold off.  What happens to the ones that are sold off?  Well they usually go to people who are lower level and can't get the old item themselves.  Now that a new better weapon is around, the old one will go down in value so that the lower level tanks can afford to buy them.  Now lower level fighter types have improved, as have higher level ones, so tank types across the board have now become stronger due to the implementation of a new weapon.<P>Casters do not benefit from this at all.  The spells that casters get have more or less been fixed from day one (with the exception of 50+ spells that had to be added once those levels became available).  Since spells are fixed by level, it is impossible for them to trickle down as equipment does for tank types.  This means that if casters are ever balanced with tanks, they will eventually become unbalanced since tanks will eventually get new equipment and casters will be stuck with the same spells.<P>While casters have equipment that does trickle down the levels, it is largely unhelpful.  Caster equipment does one of 2 things.  It either gives the casters more manna or it has a right clickable ability.  There is really no other benefit to be gained from caster equipment.  Stats other than the one linked to your manna are basically worthless (with the possible exception of Charisma for Enchanters) as the benefit of these stats is negated by the fact that casters don't see hand to hand combat.  Now, while more manna is nice it really doesn't do all that much.  The difference between my level 40 wizard when she is equipped with all her equipment (reasonable equipment for her level) and when she is completely naked is about one to one and a half nukes.  That isn't much.  And if you consider that I get manna back just as fast regardless of how much you have, they extra manna in the pool is basically just for emergency situations when you have to do a little bit more with your spells.  Down time afterwards is also increased due to the extra manna.  Right click abilities are nice but do not make insane amounts of difference.<P>"But my Cleric / Druid / Shaman / Enchanter, seems to be quite powerful enough."  The reason these classes are not screaming at being overshadowed is because their power is based on the power of the tanks they work with.  Clerics heal tanks so that they can keep fighting.  If you can keep a more powerful tank fighting, that healing has done a lot more than the same healing put on a less powerful tank.  So in a sense, healing gets more powerful as the tank gets more powerful.  Healing also has a built in efficiency increase.  A tank that can do more damage will kill a monster faster than one who does less damage.  This means that the monster will have less time to do damage to the tank.  This means that the healing needed to keep the better equipped tank fighting is less than the poorly equipped tank against the same monster.  Better armor for tanks only increases this effect by making tanks take less damage and therefor require less healing.  Shamen and Enchanters derive a large part of their usefulness by buffing tanks.  Haste style spells are particularly effective since they make a tank do even more damage faster.  This scales with the new equipment.  A tank with better equipment does more damage faster, which is then bumped to even faster when they get buffed.  To illustrate this point further, how often do you see clerics use their nuke spells effectively?  In almost every case I've seen, any cleric that uses their manna to nuke is yelled at since their healing is a much much better way of doing damage.<P>As the system stands, the power of casters (especially ones that don't enhance tanks such as wizards and magicians) is fixed by their level where as the power of tanks is dependent largely on equipment.  There are no spells that casters can get that make other spells of the same level obsolete.  Caster equipment as it is has no baring on how powerful their spells are.  Caster stats have no baring on how powerful their spells are (although they do effect how many spells can cast if they have full manna).  This means that there is no way for a caster of a set level to be come more powerful.<P>As things stand getting new equipment is one of the main reasons to continue playing everquest.  It is the driving force behind the game.  If no more new equipment becomes available a lot of drive to play the game will be lost.  However if new equipment keeps getting put in, casters (especially wizards and magicians) will fall further and further behind in the scale of power.  Spells will never do more damage or get more manna efficient since they will not be changed but tanks will continue to do more damage and take less damage as their armor and weapons get improved.  This will eventually result in casters becoming worthless except as support for the tanks, (which is something that wizards don't do at all).  I really don't want to see this eventuality come to pass.  <P>There needs to be some way of scaling the power of casters to their stats or to their equipment or else they will simply fade into uselessness.  I believe that this is a very real concern that needs to be looked into.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Also<P><BR>It is a Clear fact that wizards are undesirable in groups, though we do get invites, were EASELY replaced by practicly any other class. Why? <BR>1, We cant keep up damage output<BR>2, In kunark, but more in velious, mobs have to meny hitpoints for us beliegerd wizards to handle.<BR>3, our damage is compleately limited to our mana, we have no pet, no alternate form of damage, we can cough up maybe 10-12K damage at 60, and were spent, done, empty.<BR>4, We have no useful spells to offer our group, no useful buff, or what have you to make your group say, i rock now thanks to our Wizard!.<P><BR>Absor has a adressed all but the later, Thanks to him recognizing out major flaws, theres a light at the end of the tunnel for our class. <P>However i wouls still like to offer something to my group, as a thank you for the invite, right now i just do damage, if those issues come into effect, we would do much better damage, an output that we should have met in the first place.<P>Afew ideas to add to our group effectiveness, is a damage added to melee wepons...<BR> (Enchanters have haste spells, Mages have damage shields, Necros do too, Wizards have 2 damage sheilds where i fail to see the effectivens.) <BR>... I would like to see, a type of spell that adds afew points of damage to every seccsessful swing of the tanks we are gourped with make. <P>i think manasink is up there to high, it isnt that effective, but with used with a tecnieque it would be extreamly useful. Also make a Group verion of this, since meny Uber mobs have AEs we could give valuble group members afew more seconds to fight. <P>Also add spells that add an inhearent amount of damage to our nukes, and those of our party, For every succsessful nuke we, or a group member makes, this would add an extra XXX points to there<BR>attack. now the casters will have use for us too.<P>Could our Damage shields Radiation/flickeringflame have some kind of low haste built into them? just asking, would be cool<P>All my ideas should have serious thought put into them, my only hope is for them to be noticed and apreciated, im not asking much, just for afew extra numbers, Those numbers are up to VI to decide.<P>BTW percentage spells where my idea! no kiddin invloved.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Tis a good thing I had my damage shield mem'd along w/ having a Weeping Wand in my hand rather than non-melee items like some casters like to do (GBS and book, etc.) otherwise it would look rather pathetic seeing a level 36 Wizard having to run away from a level 8 mob ...especially when the Wizard was full health and full mana to begin with.<P>Sineed, I think you need to step back a little and see the picture from a bigger angle rather than that narrow one. We are not perfect, despite what you think. And if we are not perfect, than we could use some work.<P><BR>You know, my personal motto is there is always SOMETHING to improve 'bout myself. Tellin' myself that I am perfect is not only a bald faced lie but I would be foolin' myself. It would be the most UNconstructive thing I could do for myself.<P><BR>Believe it or not, but that is how you are coming off.<P>If you take this as a flame, sorry not my attempt ...but I stand by what I said and that is why I said it.<P>Safe travels on your adventures and may your luck be better than mine.<P><BR>Shenlung Tianzhu<BR>Level 36 Wizard of Brell<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor:<P><BR>ADD ITEM: Impose minimum damage for Wizard spells. And if you really want to get fancy with this, make the minimums scale up as the Wizard goes up in levels. This would start at around level 24 for the Wizard clas since tactics for fighting mobs changes drastically around this time.<P><BR>Example:<BR>Level 24: Minimum is 10% of spell max<BR>Level 29: Minimum is 20% of spell max<BR>Level 34: Minimum is 30% of spell max<BR>Level 39: Minimum is 40% of spell max<BR>Level 44: Minimum is 50% of spell max<BR>Level 49: Minimum is 75% of spell max (b/c of Ice Comet)<P>Level 50+: May require some more thought since Lures become viable at this time.<P>OR... for across all levels, the % of the minimum can be the same. If it is decided that we deserve a more diverse spell book (i.e. more elements at each spell level) ...than you can make some elements give a better minimum ratio. Would be tricky to factor in Resistences, but hey... that is why you guys earn the big bucks.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P><BR>WHY SUGGEST THIS?<BR>==================================<P>I was reading some of the other class threads and it surprised me to see that a Monk's Thunderous Kick was being considered for minimum damage ...as well as 2 Handed Slash for all melee classes, mentioned in the Paladin thread.<P><BR>I know we brought up the minimum damage idea b/c I remember suggesting it myself.<P>The same arguement that the Monk's use for Thunderous Kick applies to our spells as well ...EXCEPT, a Monk is still fighting w/ his hands. So if their kick fails they are not completely useless. If our spells fail, we are completely useless.<P><BR>Do you know WHY many groups that do invite Wizards, invite Wizards ? Mainly because they depend on the casters to do a full mana burn when things go wrong. That is our moment to actually do something other than med. So do know what it is like when the whole group is depending on you to help turn the tides when things go bad and all you get is complete resists ???<P>Well since you do not play a Wizard, let me tell you. It feels extremely lousy. When this happens the only thing you end up accomplishing is making sure you die first because you chain casted trying to get some damage in, and the group still perishes.<P><BR>We have more of a right to ask the Dev team to consider Minimum damage for our attacks than any other class. Period.<P>If it can be considered for the melees than surely it can be considered for Wizards and maybe even other casters as well, like Mages.<P>Please add this to the list, Absor!<P>And if anyone else agrees w/ me, please note it so in your posts so Absor does not miss this point because I think Minimum damage for our spell line would go a LONG way to improving our class.<P>No this won't give us anymore damage, nor will it make us more wanted in groups ...but it might help stop groups from shunning us b/c now we can actually provide something.<P>Removing that 6 level cap on our spells would also go a long way.<P><BR>Thanks for taking the time,<BR>Shenlung Tianzhu</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Thanks for putting together the list.  A few notes:<P>1)  Do not take away our AE snares!   The people complaining about AE snares are newbie wizards who haven't learned how to play their class and snare themselves on accident.  AE snaring is one of the few things we do better than a druid - do not take it from us.  If you want to add a low mana single target snare I wouldn't complain.  That would certainly help us against Velious mobs that sometimes takes 4 or 5 tries to stick a snare on.  I guess you could even make the level 29 snare single target, but I don't want to lose the ability to AE snare - at least keep Atol's as it is.<P>2)  Invis to undead is fine for wizards.  We are masters of sight, it only seems reasonable that we are relatively competent at hiding ourselves. Like all wizard spells, it is self only and thus doesn't infringe on anyone else's territory.  If you really want to take it away, please compensate us by actually giving us some good invis spells.  How about group invis?  Group plainsight? Or allowing improved invis to be cast on others?  How would these unbalance the game?   My barbarian warrior friend is constantly running around nightblind because our shaman can't spare the mana to give her acumen.  My mana is far less valuable than his ...  let me cast spells on others!<P>3)  Group friendly spells!  I did't see anything on your list addressing our problems as the most selfish of casters.  People at Verant constantly say this is a grouping game, but I can't do a single thing to aid my groupmates besides blowing stuff up!  Would it destroy game balance if I could share a bit of mana with my mates or if harvest was a group spell?  If you want people to group, you need to start giving them reasons too.<P>I appreciate your taking the time to do this.  I just want to see some meaningful changes come of it.  Frankly, I could care less about what you do with Al'kabor spells or any of the other crappy spells no one uses.  I would much rather you address the fundamental problems with wizards - and don't make us even weaker by taking away the few things we already have. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oh, a couple more points.<P>4)  Cazic port is dangerous.  Big deal.  Danger is fine.  If you want to fix dangerous ports, fix dangerous evacs.  Cazic gate is a travel spell, not somewhere you evac to escape to.  Oh, and you could easily move the WK port location to the other side of the world without changing the actual geography.  I'd be happy to land on the dirt rather than a fancy wizard pad.<P>5) Imbue fire opal is hard to get.  Again, not a big deal.  People kill Nagafen all the time.  If someone really wants the spell, they can get it from a friend.  Let's focus on real changes and not silly stuff like this!  This spell affects maybe 20% of wizards anyway (most of us don't worship Solsek Ro).<P>6)  Magic only mobs?  Who is the genius who thought of that?  Who's going to tank?  What's the point?  I agree it is stupid to have melee only mobs.  I feel like an idiot when I have to use lure spells to hit green cubes in Skyshrine, but it doesn't make our life better to impose the same stupid rules on our melee friends.

</FONT><HR>Fellow Wizards: you don't need an AOE snare to quad kite!  Druids manage without an AOE snare.  They can do it because their single target snares works like this:<P>1. Low mana cost: their level 1 snare is 15 mana.  Their level 29 snare is 35 mana.<P>2. Long lasting.  Their 29 snare lasts *10 minutes*.<P>With a snare that works like that, they can snare all the mobs *before* they gather them together for quad kiting.  With our AOE snare, we have to get the gathered together first, and then snare them.<P>I'd gladly trade Bonds of Force for something that works like the druid's 29 snare: 35 mana and 10 minutes.  (Oh, and their 29 snare casts in 1.75 seconds, so it's easy to cast while being beaten on, and since it is not AOE, they don't risk catching themselves....we have to root, back away, then snare in that situation).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Shenlung - on giving your post some more review, I am a bit concerned for you.  I am not Sinneed, I am not a wizard.  This discussion is not about me (a kinda plump bald guy at a keyboard (actualy 2 keyboards, one of my Paly's is up on the other, waiting for disease to go away or his mana to come back).  It is about a game.  A game that is designed to be HARD, and one you CANNOT WIN, but must simply play until you are tired and then quit.<P>The game is based on the idea of classes that have strengths and weaknesses.  Wizards have one strength, really:  we Nuke Real Hard, Real Fast, or Both.<P>I am sorry you are seeing the wizard class through the narrow view of a chance run of bad luck against at lvl 8 skellie.  I remember a friend who hit 49, memmed IC, nuked an orc pawn, and hit for 1.  He was pretty upset.  I laughed real hard and beat it to death with a stick.  All I can suggest you do is play any other blasting class at a similar level.  You will miss the power and variety of your wizard.  At higher levels, our resist rates are usually (random, see?) substantially lower than most others, most of the time.  We are never going to outnuke a cleric on an undead mob.  And druid dd against summoned hurts real bad.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Just to make sure you understand, I am not lauding my ability to play a wizard (I strive to be competent at each of my chars, nothing more).  I certainly never claimed that *I*, nor did I ever claim *the wizard class*, is perfect.  I am OK, the wizard class is great.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I may not play a wizzy, but the fact that this class is pretty much obsolete I do not like at all.<P>Just an idea I had which every caster should get, and which would be very realistic, as well as making wizzies more useful due to higher dmg output:<P>I understand that a fire spell does fire damage, and that a blizzard type spell does cold damage. But lets take Ice Comet: this spell in fact does cold damage (as intended) but one thing you could do is to add some "solid" damage to it, too (i.e. give it 2 seperate damage calcs: cold, since it's ice, and crushing since it's a COMET hitting the mob). The cold damage would be the same as it always was, but the crushing damage would be somewhere around 500 or 600dmg and a mob could evade it through checking it'd defense against melee attacks. This wouldn't be overpowering at all in a large raid situation, as the wizzy would have to carefully time his nukes because of the huge aggro. And while not being overpowering, it would enable them to do more damage to a mob with 100k HP, as well as giving them a chance to do some damage even if the cold component of the spell is resisted (we're talking about wizards, the masters of mana based direct damage)<P>Wizards are meant to do most damage pet hit, yet they don't, especially not on high lvl raid mobs. Make this a post 50's spell upgrade if you think it too powerful pre 50, but give it to wizzies and give them a lot more.<P>Wizzies have been obsolete for too long and REALLY deserve a BIG bone (clerics and necros also need a good bone).<P>Giving some classes interdisciplinary abilities is ok, but not on the costs of making another unwanted<P>Sumeine, lvl 49 cleric of Tunare -- retired for now because too boring<BR>Vilye, lvl 37 necro of Inny<BR>Bertoxx</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Phoenix, I heard ya man! This is an excellent post and primarily uses the economy of norrath to support that casters in general don't increase in power relative to our counterpart melee types. This wouldn't be a problem if our mana regened as fast as the stamina of a melee. I can tell you one thing, if VI ever made it so that the stamina went up like mana plus you add the costs of mana for boosting up stamina with spells, you are going to have a mad uprising. Based on my 20 lvl warrior i play, it takes about 20 sec to get all my stamina back but with a caster like my wizy, it takes 12 minutes from oom at times.<P>Even though I have made passsionate pleas for efficient spells in terms of dmg/mana ratio, this means nothing if mobs in SoV and kunark have high enough resist where casting a debuff doesn't matter, you still get tons of resists. This means there is no point to debuff the mob since you can't magically damage it to begin with. This affects all casters and no tanks. This just reinforces the reason why groups prefer a tank over a caster in many cases. <P>We can sit here all day/night and argue but in my opinion I ask for VI to check the mobs in SoV and kunark for that matter for<P>1) fair resist on them<BR>2) fair health points<P>I heard that some mobs can have over 100k hp, and I'm sure they would have like 200+ resist too. To be immune, more or less, a player should have 150 resist and by giving mobs resistances over this number is like making it so only it can be damaged by physical(melee) combat. There is no reason to have casters. Even 150 player resist doesnt' keep mobs from magically damaging you. I don't think I've ever seen a resist done on my by a mob even if I have 160 cold resist.<P>You owe your customers an apology and you should fix this mess in the expansions. We trusted that we would be given a quality product. I did ask for a refund on SoV once but I was told by a GM in game that there are no guarantees playing this game. We are at your mercy but too much of this halo effect, sociological term, will make your gamers just go to another game. I don't see any other solution other than VI fixing the expansions rather than adding traps when you port in a zone, making zones one way, making 40 trash mobs have 5k+ hp, ruining the game by making tanks casters which they said they were never going to do. Yah, I've seen a paly cast some weird heal spell off his helm, since when can you cast a natural healing spell from a helm with no mana? Most healing, historically, has come from nature, and to cast a heal spell from a hat just blew me away for example.<P>Pluto<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Grimstaf,<BR>  You seem to believe that by giveing up IU we will gain anything.  I don't know where this perseption is coming from.  Frankly, I am not at all impressed with the list as it missed the core problem with wizards and that is our efficiancy or lack there off compared to other spell casters and also our lack to contribute to a group other then being a second rate CC person behind the Enchanter.  At lvl 55 I see my primary responsibilty in a group is to aid the Enchanter with CC via my AoE snares and my Roots.  As most Wizards know we can only afford to cast once or maybe twice per mob on a fast pulling group or we risk going oom and being usless to the group as our mana is the only thing that allows us to contribute anything to a group but being an exp spunge.  Frankly, other then a mana increase rate based on the size of a group where you regen mana faster with more members in your group, I really don't know how the wizard class will ever be balanced in Norrath.  And forget about going to SoV where even our Lures are resisted too hell.  I can't even cast my drought line on greens as they are more often then not entirely resisted.  Opps there goes 215mana.  Oh well.<P>Kelhadar Drakain<BR>55 Evoker Fennin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well looking at the other class list discussion threads I noticed that there are 2 to 3 times as many replies to the wizard thread, this indicates that we are still cocerned about our roles. I mean it is nice to have a list of what is under consideration but it doesn't address a lot of the major ideas in the original disscussion, as a matter of fact yjis list seems more like a place to start a disscussion than a list to end a disscussion.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, Thank you for taking the time to read the posts and come up with your list.  With 14 threads it is obvious that there are SERIOUS problems with wizzies that need to be addressed.<P>I hope that the people who make the decisions can see the problems, especially since they are the primary cause of these problems by their increases in power that the expansions and recent additions (disciplines) have added to other classes (increased power in weapons etc.) and by their creation of the truly Uber MoBs in Velious.  A secondary cause is the lack of defensive abilities available to the class stated in the literature to be the masters of defense -- this was left out in the original creation of the class.<P>Adjustments need to be made that address these Verant created problems.  These adjustments can be in these areas:  1) low mana efficiency; 2) inability to do sufficient damage to Velious Uber MoBs; and, 3) lack of group desireability (defensive skills?).<P>Mana:  Give wizzies a faster mana regen than other classes, maybe by a factor of 2 at level 20 that increases with level increases up to a factor of 5 at level 50, but that is still made faster by a clarity buff (and maybe give us a group clarity, but weaker than an enchanters).<P>Velious damage:  increases in the max damage spells do which is directly related to a MoBs hp (that is it does damage equal to a per centage of the MoBs hp) is the only way to truly address this problem.  <P>Groups:  The first two will help some, but some sort of group spells are needed as well.  (e.g. a DD effect added to the damage other members of a group do or which increases the damage they do by a percentage; or the group clarity) I won't repeat all of the suggestions listed above.<P>Defense:  There are so many possibilities posted above that I won't post again here except to say that this area must be addressed for wizards to remain a viable class in Velious, whether the defensive additions are self only or group oriented.  As it is, aggroes onto the wizzie are problematic, esp on overpulls when the wiz needs to be able to take down a MoB all alone to "save" the group and be the true defensive masters they are supposed to be.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sinneed:<P>I pray you listen this time ...or maybe I should say, read carefully. Start reading carefully...<P><BR>I have never said we were useless, nor have I said we were broken. *I* said we are losing our value. There is a diminishing returns going on in Norrath right now. With expansions coming out, casters are losing value.<P>If you cannot see this than you are not paying close enuff attention. You say I have a narrow view, no I believe it is the other way around. I used to be like you, defending the class no matter what someone said. Why? Cuz at the time I believed what I was saying was correct.<P>Now I cannot believe that anymore. Our value is simply diminishing. Take a look at some of the melee type boards (not here on this site cuz I don't read those) and there are tanks complaining b/c new and wonderful weapons are coming out thereby making their weapons worth less and now they have more powerful weapons to work for. Wow, I would love to have that complaint.<P><BR>Tanks do for more damage in a normal everyday group. How much proof is required before you actually read it, Sinneed?<P>Tanks at my level have such great weapons that my quick fasting "HARD" hitting spells rarely keep up. I start casting now when the mob is around 75-90% HPs (pending mob) b/c most likely by the time I am done casting I am either gonna get the kill, be too late, or just barely make it so the tanks only need 1 or 2 more hits.<P><BR>So where does my quick casting spells help me now?<P>I will tell you, it is when there is an over pull. Then I can prove my worth and gotta pray the Resist God is hearing my prayers that day.<P>Speaking of resists, how in the heck can you call that bad luck when I get FIVE ...READ THAT 5, complete resists in a row! I had to resort to melee cuz my mana drained down past half way ...on a level 8 mob?! ...I could see one spell ...maybe even two, but 5 in a row???!<P><BR>Sorry but your warrior missing the mob doesn't cut it for me. Solution is Cleric healing the warrior and giving him the stamina spell and the warrior is back in business. If a wizard fizzles or resists outta mana there is no quick fix. Your argument lacks logic. Oh I did NOT say that I do not think tanks should not have minimum damages on their hits. I did not argue that. I said that we (Wizards) have just as much right to that argument, if not more.<P><BR>Despite what you think, I do not think this game is hard. It is all a matter of gettin into a routine, that is all. If you think this game is hard, than you have not played many games.<P>Yeah this isn't 'bout you, so why do you keep bringing you into the argument? <P>"i love my wizard, don't change him" - Sinneed<P><BR>Tell me that is not selfish? That is selfish. Some of us do want a change. Change is good. EverQuest is changing. Norrath is changing. Other classes are changing. Everything is changing, yet you want to remain static. NO thank you, change is good.<P><BR>I agree, we should not bash our class b/c that IS harmful. I agree w/ you whole-heartedly on that issue, BUT (yes a but)... we need to recognize our faults.<P>This thread is 'bout our faults and our suggestions to fix those faults ...not hold a self help group to make us all feel better 'bout our class. I didn't come here for that. I came here to answer Absor's questions.<P><BR>There is a very distinguishable line btwn trying to fix our faults and bashing our name. I am sorry you cannot see that. Many of us here are trying to fix the faults. I have seen far less 'total negativity' in these threads than I have seen the first 34 levels of my career as a Wizard.<P><BR>I am glad we can have this type of conversation w/o resorting to flaming b/c I really do want you to understand that the goal of this thread is to make us even better. The purpose is a 'good' thing. I know some people do not like change, but Norrath is changing ...vastly.<P>I took a break from EQ for 'bout 5-6 months b/c I overplayed (burn out) and while waiting for friends to catch up, i kinda quietly left for awhile. When I did Kunark was already out and all of the zones explored. But when I came back I can tell you that I saw a BIG change in Norrath when I came back ...HUGE change. Who knows what kind of changes Velious is gonna bring. Velious is still rather new. It's impact right now is mostly just affecting the prices of old items ...the major stuff will happen later.<P><BR>In this HUGE change I talk 'bout ONE big difference I see is in the tanks today than that of the tanks of yesterday. May not help since I am on an old server (Brell) which means everyone is twinked up the wazooo ...but hey, if I have to change servers just to enjoy being a spell caster once again does that not right there prove there is a balance issue btwn casters and melees?<P><BR>I have both a Monk and a Paladin so I know what is like to be on the melee side of things ...not at high levels mind you, but enuff to see the difference. I do a lot of research and from what I see, casters value is on the decline. (NOTE: remember I did not say we are worthless). I do not know for sure that I am a good wizard. My friends say I am. The people I grouped with before I quit for that long 5-6 months still remember me and say hi so I would like to think that I am a good Wizard.<P>Ok let me pull out a quotation which I cannot remember exactly so you will have to forgive me, but wasnt it Socrates when asked why he was the smartest man alive responded with, Because I understand there is still too much that I do not know.<P><BR>Notice he didnt respond with, cuz I am the greatest. He responded by saying that he can see his faults. We need to be able to see our faults, Sinneed not self-glorify ourselves. This is not the right time for that. That is not what the purpose of this thread is. Nor is it to say we are worthless. Just to state our faults and find a way to work on them.<P><BR>I said a lot here, so you might want to re-read this message before you respond again. Than you might see you had me pegged wrong.<P>Good luck and safe travels,<P>Shenlung Tianzhu<BR>Level 36 Wizard of Brell<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
