</FONT><HR>Thanks for responding so quickly, Absor. I haven't read all the replies, rants and rebuttles to your response (hehe), but I had a quick question...<P>How could the Lute of the Howler be considered a balance issue? On my server there are probably less than a dozen 50+ bards out of the what? 4,000-6,000 accounts there? Of these high level bards, only 2 have lutes. I could certainly see why enchanters might be a little miffed if this were an inherent ability that bards possesed - to cast illusions on themselves. But this ability comes with a price - mainly leveling up to around level 57 (which is no small feat) and being lucky enough to get one of these loots in a very tough dungeon. I don't have one of these lutes myself - I'm looking forward to getting one for the fun of it, but do bards even get stat bonuses associated with the illusion? Or is it just for kicks?<P>Wouldn't taking this illusion out set a precedent for removing the DE, Iskar and Erudite masks as well? How is it different from those?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok one LAST POST!<P>Shauri's Sonorous Clouding: great song, awesome song, with only one thing needed.....fix the radius.  I've been killed too many times because a party member lagged too far behind and went visible, which makes me go visible too somehow.  Please fix.<P>The other thing is a general question: has the stamina loss effect increased with the last patch?  I just noticed that taking a ship, fighting and singing, etc.  I am using WAAAY too much stamina compared to before.  A guide said this is how its meant to be.  I would love to see Stamina (I'm talking about our yellow bar here) go up incrementally with level rather than the other way around, which is how the Guide described it to me.

</FONT><HR>OK, I didn't catch this post back at the start and haven't had the time to read thru it all yet.  But here are some current thoughts.<P>Mez:  OK, the targetted mezzes are working fine now, but why is our AoE mez STILL nerfed to hell?<P>Charm:  Cap of lvl 51...please raise this, we lose a powerful ability by gaining levels, and that should not happen.  Even if you have to increase the mana cost...<P>Epic Quest:  Everyone's out of range to kill Vox and no one can kill Gorenaire.<P>Melee:  Bards do fight melee, but more because when there's an enchanter around there's nothing else to do.<P>Clarity:  This line of spells has become too good.  Bards aren't needed to be around since clarity 2 is so good.<P>Resists:  Because there are now so many resist items in the game, shaman talismans that stack with cleric resists, and whatnot, bards aren't as needed for epic type encounters.  Also, people do not want to take their resists past 255 fearing that the old bug of resetting has not been fixed.<P>Nerfs:  We get effected by ANY nerf, please keep this in mind...we've been subjected to so many nerfs intended for other classes it's getting annoying.<P>Testing:  Sometimes it seems like bard stuff just isn't tested...perhaps you should have someone on your team specifically ask you if bard stuff was tested before every change.<P>Haste:  Let bard haste stack with chanter/shaman haste, the icons make it look like they should, but only the stat portions do, not the haste.<P>Armor:  Remember, we have plate armor...and it's not because we can tank, it's because enemies hit us...my imbrued bracer has worse stats than the lambent, that needs to be looked at.<P>Well, that's what I can think of at the moment.<P>Algara Offkey<BR>53 Bard<BR>Menacing Visage<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ok couple of quick points here absor so please bear with me...<BR>1-you mentioned that just because we are a plate class does not mean that our armor should have plate ac.....then a little while later mention that we are defensive hybrids.....um is my logic flawed? i thought one of the prime stats for ANY defensive oriented class was armor class....please explain this apparent oxymoron<BR>fact is plate ac should be plate ac, period<P>2-resists at raid level encounters are basically meaningless, and it does seem that a combonation of the rumoured soft cap of 175, and the persons level have more of an impact on whether they resist or not, to me this is a very serious issue because if we are not needed for resists, then we should be able to contribute in some way...and we all know that bard melee blows<P>3-haste stacking....our hastes are really weak and not necessary when theres a shaman or enchanter around, which nowadays they always are due to the design of a lot of the newer places on kunark and velious...frankly theres a lot of places people flat out refuse to go to without one or both of those classes so we then become irrelevant<P>4-if our armor effects were to be useless and not desined to give us something usefull that we didnt already have, then how do you explain items like the cobalt bracer (shrink) or incardine bp (invisbility) would it really kill you guys to at least take the concerns about wasted effects on our armor seriously? (and yes i know incardine is war/sk only, but its still an incredibly usefull effect for warriors, and by no means do i ever want to see warriors or sks nerfed in any way)<P>5-i agree with you about one thing....we do not need double attack, higher defensive abilities would be nice though (dodge/parry/riposte)<P>6-i personally like slashing weapons over piercers, so leave those alone, if youd like out more piercers in the game for those who prefer those weapons  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>7-insipid ditty should be made into a targetted stun with no other effects, no debuff, no dmg sheild, nothing, just a stun, even with a 5 sec recast timer (xxx stands looking stupid) would be a nice message.....and make it so that it interrupts casters, even dragons/giants etc<P>8-the white scale is horribly out of whack...post 52, you can still get scales from ragefire from helping your cleric buddies with their epic, but there is no way or other means that is reasonable for the white scale....i dont care if its a ragefire type dragon that you have to quest for to make spawn, or even have it drop off a dragon in WW<P>9-when talking balance it should not be balance vs other classes, rather balance vs environment, and even in this we are lacking....we cant take a hit, we cant hit back hard enough (be it with spell or song), we dont really help effect the outcome of raids (the cleric epic makes us obsolete for CR, but i dont mind, clerics deserved something this awesome), and we are marginal at best when people are filling out groups because of haste/slow stacking, CC, downtime, damage output.....personally i can live with either one or the other if you raise our level of defense (and have our PLATE armor be commisurate with this on the level of pal/sk), OR raise damage caps for our melee and our attack skill level<P>as for dead issues, yes lullabye is a dead issue, i can live with that, chain is bad, but i dont think it should have been destroyed like it was, as it is now its rarely memmed<P>p.s. theres no need to get hostile absor, we know that you got a thankless job, but walk in our shoes the last couple of years and you would understand why bards are basically very ticked off lately  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Dyahannah 53 Minstrel Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>i have a 20th bard.. and im about to start a new bard so i can play with my brother.. he is just now getting a computer.  i like the class pretty much the way it is.  but some of the suggestions i have really liked.. <P>like letting a bard play 3 songs at once .. to cut down on carpul tunnel hehhe.. if you did that.. you could just have it so that you press one key.  starts a song.. then all your spell gems come back except the one thats playing. then it would let you start another.. but i dont know if thats overpowering or not.. as some songs have better effects when played constantly..<P>another thing.. about the 15th level kellins lucid lulliby.  this song is currently useless.. i tried making some ORC PAWNS go to sleep today. i was using a lute, and i have 90 base chr. at level 20 an orc pawn, something that is so green should go right to sleep.  but it failed 5 times in a row. and lots of newbies died.  it never stuck on it once.  dont get me wrong, sometimes the song works.. BUT<P>I think this song should work nearly all the time if im using an instrument, and for balance sake, if it works so well it should tie up the bard so that he/she should only play that song, so make the spell alot less resisted while using an instrument, and make it only last 5 seconds.  this way the bard can actually use this song to some benefit. instead of just getting himself and his party massacred.<P>it would be cool as well if enchanters could use that vial of viscious mana to help make bards a magic lute, or a magic drum.  for lower level bards.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Okay...a few thoughts...<BR> <BR>There is something really amusing about being called a "defensive hybrid." I dont seem to defend well against much of anything at level 52. What is really funny when you think about bards status of "jack of all trades, master of none" the only thing I can think of that bards do better then any other class, is we run faster (with drums). So if by defence you mean the ability to run away really fast...okay...its hard to kill a bard outdoors is true. If this is the case, and bards are supposed to be the best at running away from fights, how about making selos accelerendo work indoors too then...then we will really be the masters of running away.<P>Seriously though, as stated, most bard songs are good for the life of a bard. This is why we dont just get the same songs over and over, just a little stronger each time, like casters do. This being said, I think the amount of increase in each song we have should be looked at over the life of a Bard. And songs that are not useful later, because a better song replaces it, should e looked at closely, to figure out how to make them useful at later levels. Because bards dont get 10+ songs at each "spell level" but just get one at each level (with the exception of 34 and 51+) at level 60 a bard should not just have 25 to 30 different songs to choose from, but 50+. <P>Synamin Stixx<BR>Bard of the 52nd Song<BR>&lt;Triton&gt; of Povar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hey Odwyn =)<P>When you ride the boat, it drains your stamina as if you were running as fast as the boat is moving.  It's a bug, but not an exciting one (you don't really need stamina for anything while on the boat).<P>One annoying bug is that for the first zone you're in, when you log into the game, you lose stamina at an accelerated rate.  This can be corrected by zoning out, and zoning back in.  <P>Also keep in mind that heavy weapons drain stamina faster than light ones.  Most bard races don't have a high stamina to begin with, and the class doesn't gain much as it advances.  If you're having trouble, try trading your weapons in for some lightweight piercers and the problem should go away (when the total weight of my weapons is around 3 or less, I don't usually lose any stamina).  It may also help you to keep jaxan's jig of vigor memorized, and sing a little spritz of it every now and again if your stamina is dipping too low.<P>- Syll</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Thanks for the reply Absor.  Judging from your reply, it's clear that I underestimated you.  When I posted my (long) letter for comments on the bard boards, one of the critiques was that some of it got too complicated and that I'd lose you.  So I gutted sections of it to make it shorter and simpler.  It's clear now that you had no trouble following it, and were actually confused by some of the oversimplifications.  I apologize for that.<P>&gt; &gt;"Comparing Rondo (57) to our level 54 song is a joke. If you're singing Rondo, a mob hitting your party on average<BR>&gt;                          1.5 times every 3 sec will take 4 dam/sec from the damage shield. For the damage shield to offset the 23% loss in<BR>&gt;                          haste, your party must be doing less than 12 dam/sec melee damage for Rondo to be better than Celerity2…<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt;                          …<BR>&gt;                          Please either fix hastes/slows so an instrument increases them, or change these songs to have double their current<BR>&gt;                          haste/slow (optionally making them instrument-only)."&lt;<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; This whole part of your discussion got completely confusing. You<BR>&gt; are trying to compare the haste component on a haste only song with a song<BR>&gt; that does several things (not just haste and damage shield). My first<BR>&gt; thought would be that of course the haste will be less when you get a ton<BR>&gt; of other bonuses with the song.<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; Frankly, I am very dubious of any comparison of things that are rather<BR>&gt; closer to apples than oranges. But I'll add the request to the list, and<BR>&gt; we'll hash it out internally a bit.<P>I cut out a paragraph to shorten the post.  Here's  the full version.<P>20% haste - Celerity (level 36) singing<BR>18% haste - Crescendo (42) brass<BR>30% haste - Verses (50) singing<BR>45% haste - Celerity2 (54) singing<BR>22% haste - Rondo (57) brass<P>Sung:<BR>Verses (50) 30% haste, 30 str (and corresponding atk), 30 agi (and corresponding AC)<BR>Rondo (57) 22% haste, 10 str (and corresponding atk), 5 atk, 8 point damage shield<P>So Rondo has on Verses +5 atk and +8 point damage shield, and loses -8% haste, -20 str, -30 agi.  If the mob double attacked and hit every 3 seconds (best-case favoring the damage shield), for the 8 point damage shield to offset the -8% haste, the party would have to be doing less than 67 dam/sec.  At level 57, a single rogue can do that much damage.  Our level 50 song is that much better than our level 57 song.<P>Comparing to Celerity2 is even worse.  If you're singing Rondo... [paragraph I included in the original]<P>&gt; &gt;"- The boots summon 1 water at a time with a 5 second cast time. PLEASE change this to summon 10 or 20 at a<BR>&gt; time so it's at least useful. As it is, I just buy my water in bulk instead of taking 2 minutes to summon a stack of<BR>&gt; water that'll all disappear every time I go linkdead. &lt;<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; Welcome to the world of magicians<P>AFAIK, all of the other summon food and summon water spells in the game generate a stack of 5 or 20.<P>&gt; &gt;"For the other classes that get it, Kunark armor effects give them something they didn't have before."&lt;<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; Here is where you get yourself in trouble with me. I do not like the idea<BR>&gt; that classes now have the ability to do things they were not intended to<BR>&gt; do by the use of items. I am strongly against such items, and their<BR>&gt; existence is certainly not going to convince me to ask that more such<BR>&gt; things go into the game.<P>Ok, so your stance is that it was a mistake to gives warriors and rogues heal and invis, and casters mana-less nukes and heals; and you'd like to remove those effects from the game, but don't feel it'd be fair to the players.  But you're not going to compound the problem by adding any more into the game.  I can live with that.<P>&gt; &gt;"This nerf affects us even when we aren't fearing, and you didn't compensate us for it in any way."&lt;<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; To be fair, you should know that this is a red flag for me. Compensation<BR>&gt; for a needed change (even if it was a nerf) is never something I will<BR>&gt; support. Show me how this change unbalanced the class or something, but<BR>&gt; don't tell me that you deserve more power because something was<BR>&gt; taken away if it was made weaker, it was because it needed to<BR>&gt; be weaker. There is no compensation.<P>That is kinda my point.  The needed change was to fix fear so it didn't cause the exploitable situation.  Instead, you guys did the easy thing and nerfed the best movement slowdowns.  This not only fixed the exploitable situation (for which I agree we shouldn't get compensation), it also reduced the effectiveness of our movement slowdowns in non-exploit situations (for which I was asking compensation).<P>A lot of bards were using the exceptional movement slowdowns of our snare-type songs to slow down incoming mobs and give enchanters more time to mez extras before they got into melee range of the party.  With the speed cap you've put in, this is much less effective as the enchanter usually only has time to mez one mob before the rest reach the party.  The loss of this ability was what I felt needed compensation.<P>&gt; &gt;"At high levels, that margin simply doesn't exist. The 10% haste on the level 60 song doesn't come anywhere<BR>&gt; close to giving us the 45% haste advantage that's needed to keep us in line with the other melee classes."&lt;<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; One of us is making a logical error here... Bardic hastes are not, primarily,<BR>&gt; designed to make the bard into damage dealer comparable to a warrior. That's not<BR>&gt; the intent. The intent is that the bards can improve the melee ability of his<BR>&gt; entire group by that amount. Keep in mind, bards were designed from the ground<BR>&gt; up to be a party based class.<P>I believe you're making the error here.  For the sake of argument, say at level 54 (when we get a 45% haste song), a bard is balanced at being able to increase his party's melee output by 45% over the unhasted base.  Now fast forward to level 60 grouped with an enchanter.  For the bard to be making a full contribution to the group, we need to increase the party's melee output by 45%.  But our haste doesn't stack with the enchanter's haste, so we have to use this 10% haste song you've given us.  You're saying if there's no enchanter in our group, our balanced contribution is to increase melee damage 45%; but if there's an enchanter in our group, our balanced contribution is to increase melee damage just 10%?  What is it about an enchanter that automatically means we must lose 35%/45% = 78% of our effectiveness when grouped with them?  To me it's like telling druids and shaman, "When you're grouped with a cleric, your heals will only heal 22% their normal amount."  Or telling rogues and monks, "When you're grouped with a warrior, your melee will only do 22% the normal amount." <P>Yes we get other abilities, but most of them conflict with or are diminished by an enchanter (and to a lesser extent shaman).  What's left isn't enough to justify bringing a bard on a major raid except because the bard is your friend.  Our primary strengths are hastes, slows, clarity, crowd control, resists, and regenerative healing.  All but the last two are made obsolete or diminished by the presence of an enchanter.  Resists are ineffective at higher levels.  And regenerative healing is, well, so boring you can do it while AFK.  We need at least one of our strengths to complement, not conflict with, enchanters for us to be desired at high level raids.  Making our hastes stack seems the easiest way to do it.<P>&gt; &gt;"OTOH, if you just don't want bards picking any high level locks, leave the cap as is, but give us the skill at about<BR>&gt; level 10. That way it's at least usable by low level bards in Befallen and Najena. I'm not sure why you'd want to do<BR>&gt; this though, seeing as rogues already have several ability monopolies (backstab, pick pocket, invis+invis to undead,<BR>&gt; poisons)."&lt;<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; *sigh*<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; Well, of course rogues have a skill monopoly on basckstab, pick pockets… this is<BR>&gt; another one of my pet peeves. I LIKE the idea that classes remain unique. Telling<BR>&gt; me that bards somehow deserve a skill just because rogues have it is silly.<P>That is kinda the point.  I shouldn't have to tell you that bards deserve the skill because we already have it.  You just chose to make it ineffectual.  Write down a list of all the major skill monopolies in the game you can think of.  I think you'll find rogues are overrepresented on the list.  I didn't want to put it so bluntly in my original post because I didn't want to make it sound like I wanted rogues nerfed (which I don't).  It seemed you intended the skill to not be a monopoly (else why give it to two classes), but your implementation made it for all practical purposes a monopoly.<P>If you didn't intend it to be a monopoly, I presented options for you to fix it.  If you intended it to be a monopoly, then by all means leave it that way.  I was just making a suggestion based on what seemed to be a deviation between the game's design (the skill being shared by bards and rogues) and implementation (nearly all locks being rogue-pickable only).  I mean you did ask for class balance issues, right?  Here's a skill that's given to two classes but only of use to one.<P>&gt; &gt;"Dirge (level 43 song). Mana cost is 800. [snip]"&lt;<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; But you also don't suffer any ill effects for being low on mana,<P>As others have pointed out, our high level charm (one of our most popular songs BTW) uses mana.  I'd mentioned that in my original draft and removed it in editing.  My bad.  Sorry.<P>&gt; &gt;"What 'negative changes' do you have in mind Absor?"&lt;<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; Well, I'm already planning on complaining about the lute that allows bards to change<BR>&gt; into werewolves. And if anything else comes up, I'll add it to my list. Right now,<BR>&gt; that's the only thing I have that I know of.<P>Heh heh.

</FONT><HR>Hail Absor... I know by now you might be tired of all the rants about bards being underpowered.. well I dont think they are necessarily underpowered, just maybe in the need of a bit of tweaking<P>the 39th lvl charm song has a MR reducing componant to it which would serve to more than likely increase the chance to recharm.. however.. the song does not re-apply.. at all... this being the case why does the MR reduce exist? you tell me...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>as for bards getting double attack.. ehhhhh im a but iffy on that one... they make a good arguement however to the one where you stated that bards are a defensive hybrid.. we most certainly are not seeing as how we have less HP than a ranger AND less ac AND a lot less defensive skills than a ranger who supposedly got more offence for a lack of defense... if we were to balance a bard the way rangers and paladins are supposedly balanced... we would be right up there with warriors... im not asking for more offensive sills per say... just make our melee a bit more useful in battle<P>one suggestion posted on this board i do not support however is the automatic weave thing... weaving separates the kick ass bards from the lazy finger bards... bards are an active class... get used to it.. I like the fact that i can weave by myself and that im one of the few high lvl bards that do it.. this is a good tool that separates the men from the boys please dont change it<P>other than that bards are great... keep up the good work absor.. and keep the asprin handy for this thread...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>Mahande Windsinger/ 48 wood elf bard/ luclin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It seems to me that bard haste is the best area for improvement.<P>Enchanter augmentation(29) provides 22-30% haste according to castersrealm. A bard matches this at 50. Augmentation costs 90 mana and has a maximum duration of 27 minutes (according to same resource) ... this means the opportunity cost for an enchanter keeping all the tanks in a group augmented is VERY LOW. <BR>I would want to see either:<BR>1. Enchanter augment line &lt; bard haste &lt; enchanter quickness line as ALL levels (as it is its a no-brainer, use quickness line if enchanter can spare the mana, or augment if not. Only at 54-55 is bard haste even worth consideration in a group with an enchanter. And in practice I note enchanters tend to have enough mana by 54 to keep a real haste on all tanks, not an augment)<BR>or (preferably)<BR>2. Bard haste stacking.<P>... by this I do not mean 2 songs at 50 and beyond with trivial haste values that require instruments. I mean all the current bard haste songs should have some stacking haste element. If they could add their full current value to the haste equation, this would be ideal. If that is too strong, make then add half their normal value when stacking on top of a haste spell. Although I doubt it would anywhere near too strong.<P>...Ideally, extend this to the attack speed debuffs as well, making 20,23,48,etc stack at normal (or half) value with the shaman insect and enchanter sleepy lines.<P>...minor balance issues.<BR>1. Accepting that some nerf to fear/snare was required (although I still suspect what happened was some VI employee watched the technique used once and mistook extreme skill AND LUCK for 'no risk' ... I know my snare doesn't seem to have anywhere near the resist rates required to pull this off without danger) the random duration on chains is really no longer called for. Examine the opportunity cost of using snare. For a ranger/druid/necro/sk it is very small. For a bard it is roughly 33% (assuming target may start running soon after) ... not 1/3 of the bards twist, but ALL of the twist (100%) once the target gets to the running point. Remove the early breaks from this song entirely, and the bard would still be wise to chain sing it, to account for a resist or two.<BR>2. Quite some time ago, Abashi asked what bards wanted to do about Desperation Dirge no longer being the only mana using song. If I recall correctly, the response was greaty in favor of replacing the mana usage with a fixed recast timer. Why was this dropped? Or better yet, who cares, just consider doing it again.<BR>3. Perhaps the first charm song should use mana. Just perhaps.<BR>4. Rune effects. At first it was (and still is by some) thought that a rune effect would absorb the hit that brought it down in its entirety. As the other rune effect using classes employ runes that are at least as great as what the things they are fighting hit for (excepting the shadow knights shieldskin spell) actually making this the case would involve a relatively minor buff. For bards, whos rune values are very very small compared to the expected damage they will be encountering at the levels they get these effects, this would represent a large boost in effectiveness. As it is, it is rarely the case that a rune effect in a 3 song twist will prevent more damage over the whole group than a healing song would repair.<P>Entirely non-balance related graphical issues (you've heard them, I know, but I'm posting on a bard thread anyway, so might as well)<BR>1. Drum, not drumstick or flute-we-think-is-a-lute.<BR>2. Slide, not waddle.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm not going to repeat the stuff that everyone has gone over, but one idea that I had for bards is that since we don't get anything great in post level 50, how about the ability to twist more songs than 3, maybe an award for the bards that stuck it out this far. To do this, you can make a songs effect last longer than 10 seconds, maybe add an additional 1 second every level after 50, this would not only make the bards who try they're best be able to twist up to 6 songs at level 60, but make it so it's not so straining to twist even 3, sometimes I find myself just twisting 2 songs after a long session of exp grunging. Another idea I had was maybe increasing the caps of Riposte and Parry. Capping them at 70 pretty much makes them worthless at high levels.

Yes we can a little, but for a game that requires an enchanter for so much, I am surprised by the lacking of "enchanterness" in bards.<BR>*Perhaps have songs that are truely AE for PCs.<BR>How is it that "group" members can hear the songs, yet those around you not in group cannot?<BR>Hmm if bards could be pc ae intead of group ae..<BR>*Have a zone duration "charming" song.  Bards are able to sway others to adore them, why not be able to go into kos areas(of intellegent mobs, such as kael), play their song, and be looked upon indifferently?  Can't bards impersonate others?  Would love to see that.<BR>*Haste here haste there.. every level almost.<BR>Why not make a few haste songs, and make them good, increase with level.  Replace the other 2-3 we dont *need* with fun songs.  Such as AE mob choas..  cause the affected targets to randomly fight another mob, run, attack a pc, or sit there and do nothing.  Perhaps having a song decreases casting times of spells by 10%-20% while played, or increases spell effectiveness.  Sure we have tons of haste for melee, but only manasong for casters? hmm.  Imagine a bard giving a cleric "spell haste" and inspiring them. Make cheal 8 seconds, not 10, give that heal spell an extra 200 hp.  For being such a group class, we do really little in group interactions.<BR>*Song durations.  Why are all songs 3 "ticks".  One listen to the local radio, and you will see not all songs are exactly 3 mins long.  Perhaps changing the time it takes to get song going(casting time? is it called that?) and duration should change for each song, and relative to its effects.<BR>*twistless playing.<BR>My fingers will fall off one day from this game.<BR>Why can't bards have one button to start a "soundtrack"?  Play this song, then this song, then this song.  Done.  That means no 1,2,2,3,3 and perhaps 1,1,1,2,2,3,3 with missed notes, or lag.  Such a relief to our wrists/fingers.<BR>Do you know how hard it is to answer /tells, guildchat, groupsay, says, occ, etc when you are trying to keep your 3 songs going?? <P>I am glad that VI is taking time to look at each class, there are little problems with each that can be fixed to make them better.  But perhaps bards just weren't engineered the right way at first, and no matter what fix/gadget/addition is applied, the result will be the same.  Bards aren't easily played, or able to be relied on for any specific function.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree with Kaearia. As allways his posts are right to the point and very well formulated.<BR>At 45th level (I play for fun!) and playing a bard since march 99 (Musiker bdate is april 99) Im starting to feel the carpal tunnel syndrome myself. I Have just altered key setup, so now I use my right hand for twisting and moving (I need to move my movement keys too I think), which helps, but I would much rather see a fix for the twisting. The suggestion that you should be able to start 3 songs just by activating them sounds good to me. currently the keyboard macros are not workable in combat because once started they take to long to end when a sudden need of a new song arises (you have to wait until the macro is at end before starting another song) or if a note is missed.<P>Apart from the issues mentioned by Kaearia and Thott I cant think of anything else...

</FONT><HR>Another thing I would like to add, could you guys make songs resisted less, especially for charms/mez. The reason being is that we have to recast a charm or mez every 10 seconds, while an enchanter can cast mez once and not have to deal with it being resisted for over a minute. To keep one mob mezzed as long as an enchanter keeping one mob mezzed we have to recast mez 8+ times, that means that the mob has 8 times to resist when against a chanter it only has one chance.<BR>Thanks Absor.<BR>Mephistro the Maestro<BR>Test Server<BR>p.s.

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I'm overwhelmed at your endurance at keeping up with these threads. I'm a game designer myself (card games, not computers) and know how tough this sort of thing is. You have my profound respect.<P>A couple notes:<BR>1. Bards are really wonderful. They're unique and enjoyable. I can't imagine playing another class. Several additions lately have greatly increased the playability of the class without reducing the importance of any other classes. Well done to your team!<P>2. Kaearia has done a *wonderful* job coallating, analyzing, and presenting the primary issues that a legion of bards have over on the Concert Hall. Please pay a bit of extra attention to K's messages, as many of us are avoiding spamming you with the same information. We figured you'd prefer it that way. <P>3. When discussing crowd control issues with bards, I think it's important to point out that I don't know of any bards that think we should take this important role *away* from enchanters. But considering the necessity of crowd control in dungeon situations, it seems important that there be a 'fallback' class in case all of the enchanters are in a group already. No one wants a situation where every group needs to have a cleric and an enchanter or else you may as well not bother. A group can substitute druids or shamans in a pinch to replace a cleric (somewhat), and I believe all bards are suggesting in terms of crowd control is the ability to be a reliable 'back up' to enchanters. It would be a shame if there was ever a single class that every group needed to have in order to be safe and effective. If that perception even exists, there is probably something to the issue. <P>Again, I admire the task you've put to yourself. If nothing else, people truly appreciate being heard.<P>Whit Scarletsong<BR>Scarlet Horizon<BR>Solusek Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Man theres too many posts to read all of them, so Im probably repeating a lot of things. These are just some of the things that I believe can be changed to balance us in terms of our songs and our usefulness to groups, as well as some other general problems. I am not including my complaints in regards to bard melee skills, or some of our other "abilities" (instill doubt?? what the heck?? give bards and rogues feign death please!!)<P>Anyways, first thing I can think of is our level 49 song.... rune effect for 20 points of damage, or 40 points if instrument is used. If Im not mistaken, this effect is all or nothing, so if a mob hits for more than 20, you will receive the full amount of damage. Um... what good is that at level 49??? Seriously, what mobs are we going to fight at that level that hits for less than 20? The idea of a mana-less rune doesnt work, its too powerful if it actually buffered a reasonable amount of damage, so please replace this with a new song.<BR>We also have some less than useful songs below 40... theres one thats see invis/ultravision... not needed after the invis song included see invis, and mask of deception gives UV.... our "identify" song... well, its kinda usefull for doing certain quests, but since we usually only get one song per level, I could think of some more useful effects. How about a group invis vs undead? <P>Post level 50, our haste and slow songs are kinda useless when grouped with an enchanter or shaman. Our slow songs "stack" with their slow spells, but only because one component of the song is different (eg a snare effect) The attack speed-debuff component of the song is not staking on the mob. Our melee enhancing haste songs "stack" with shaman and enchanter buffs, again only because of the stat increasing components. We are not adding to the haste of the tanks. <P>Our ability to mez... hmmm, in most RPGs, bards are seen as the group member that stays back and puts the monsters to sleep... not so with Verant's "Vision" of bards =) ok, so level 50 bards cant mez a level 1 snake... working as intended....  Although a mana-less aoe mez would present problems if the song worked all the time, but I say give us back out ablilty to do crowd control. An enchanter can mez a group of mobs, then sit down to med. Make our lullabye have a resist rate that would make it possible to do some crowd control, but a very risky form of it. The bard would have to keep the song up all the time, and would get hit a lot, due to the random duration. A level 50 bard really shouldnt get resisted by mobs in Crushbone lol.<P>Bards and mana... yes that darn mana song that gets us into groups doesnt even afffect the bard himself. Again "working as intended". In a way, we really are hybrids, and our mana pool in based on INT. We need INT to charm things, but after a ressurection, we cant do a damn thing to get our mana back. We can ask for clarity, mod rods, mana transfer from necros, we can stand on our heads till the blood rushed to our brains, but nothing works. No other class, after receiving a ressuraction, is unable to help their group again after a few minutes of meditation. Perhaps the reason our "med" skill is capped at 1 or 0 is that you dont want us to be able to change songs quickly in the middle of a fight. This is acceptable, when you think about it, a song should be a lot harder to remember than a spell. However, theres no reason not to let us regain our mana back faster. I SERIOUSLY doubt bards will start using our "desperat dirge" song any more frequently than we are now (uh, never? =P) lol 300 points aoe... we'll use it when we're desperate to find out where our bind point is....<P>Selo's song of travel... lose the damn invis component. Running through fronteir mountains, some greenie giant smacks me, causing me to plumet from a height where my awesome safefall skill (whats it capped at, 3? lol) cant save me. <BR>How about if we get hit, we drop invis but still have lev and speed? Either that, or get rid of the invis component.<BR>Now, on to the Kunark singing steel armor. Seriously, summon water? Summon food? Eye of Zomm? What the heck?? You need to be level 45 to activate these items, so why do we get such lame effects? Other classes get stuns, heals, buffs, DoTs and DDs... we get to summon one bottle of water at a time. If you must keep this rediculous effect on the boots, at least make it summon one stack at a time. When in a group, you cant stop the mana song without the casters complaining, and if you ask them to summon water, they say you got the SS boots! (we cant win!) Same with the pants. Hmm eye of zomm on the helmet.. give us something useful.... I realize we cant really get DDs and DoTs from out armor for 2 reasons: first, the "Vision" doesnt like bards doing a lot of damage with one spell/song... 2nd, its not practical for us to stop singing during a fight. How about some nice buffs instead? For the SS arms, please have the stamina effect self-only and permanent, so that our stamina does not deplete while wearing the arms. I dont think this would make the game unbalancing, as there is a shaman spell that gives unlimited stamina (dont remember the name, acumen or somethng like that). The BP, 100 hit point heal? Damn... I dont have this item, but again I think  would be shouted at if I stopped singing the mana song to use this during downtime. During fights... 100 HP? Can we say Loading please wait?<P>Those are just some of the things that need changing, I didnt touch weapons/instruments/twisting/melee skills (parry and riposte at some levels that i'll probably never reach lol)<P><BR>Acoustic<BR>Level 51 Minstrel<BR>E'ci<BR>"The Legue of Antonican Bards shall avenge my death!!"<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Ok absor, here is my input as a lvl 57 bard. I've observed much, so I hope what I say means something. <P>Bards really are the jack of all trades- EQ got that right. The inherent problem in that skill is that we are master of none, which is drastic at high levels. That is a problem, because serious groups (high level in dangerous places) need things we can't offer. Here's the short little list:<P>1. Melee Damage- High level Bards do less damage than any other damage dealing class. All melee do drastically more damage, as well as mages, necros, wizzies, shaman and druids.<P>2. Healing- Bards can't heal during a battle at all. At level 55+, tanks start having 3500-4500 hp with cleric buffs. Mobs hit for 150+. Our 60hp heal per tick doesn't come anywhere in the area of cutting it. That's not neccessarily a terrible thing as itself, but combine with the rest of these.<P>3. Haste- Bards do get decent mana-free haste buffs. These work great until about level 50. At around that level, mobs become "serious", and haste is essential for serious groups. Both enchanters and shaman can put melee at 60%-80% haste and above at these levels easily. Bards get a 30% haste at 50, and a 45% haste at 54. Plain and simple, our haste doesn't cut it at high levels. Maybe if they stacked...but they don't. Again...on it's own...not so bad...but keep adding these up.<P>3. Slowing- Bards get some less useful slows...around 20-30% even at high levels. Shaman get the best slows, that demolish mobs, but enchanters get great slows, too. Superior in effect, and the fact that it doesn't have to be reapplied every 3rd song. Same concept...jack of all trades...but keep going down the list.<P>4. Mez- Enchanters are the kings of mez. Bards get a "so-so" mez at 28, and don't get another until 53. Now...don't misunderstand me- the 53 mes is great. I can mes up to three targets with little resists. But...because I don't get AoE mes or stuns, it takes a while to mes more than one...and some damage gets done. It also takes the bard out of the fight...where as an enchanter can still slow, nuke, stun...etc. Again...<P>5. Mana replenish- bards do get the better mana replenishment spells in the game. Manasong and Cantana of replenishment are a tad better than Clarity and Clarity II. However...an enchanter can do this, too. Also, I often have to stop manasong for crowd control, or snaring, or something else...so the enchanter version turns out to be a little better because it's always on. Here is my point =)<P>Enchanters can do everything a bard can realistically offer to a group, and they do it all better. Straight up. The damage that bards do can be equilized by either the better haste of an enchanter or one nuke. As a level 57 bard, I'm the poor mans enchanter. I rarely group with an enchanter because our abilities are so similar, and they happen to do the most important ones better. <P>This is the curse of the "jack of all trades". Master of none. Serious high level groups need cleric to heal, shaman and druids are way second choice, if they can handle it at all. Serious high level groups need tanks to take damage- Rangers, Paladins, or monks are third choice after warriors and SK's. So when it comes to crowd control, Enchanters are the standard. And because the useful high level bard abilities are so similar to enchanters (and inferior), we get left behind, or we become the "make due" enchanter in less serious groups. <P>This is the problem of high level bards. Solution? Bard need to be reworked from level 50-60. You guys need to determine what role you want a bard to play, because right now we only have two roles: 1- Make due chanter 2- 6th slot filler for some damage and mana replenish. We need abilties that seriously benefit a group that enchanters don't have.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>[quote]&gt;"For the other classes that get it, Kunark armor effects give them something they didn't have before."&lt;<P>Here is where you get yourself in trouble with me. I do not like the idea that classes now have the ability to do things they were not intended to do by the use of items. I am strongly against such items, and their existence is certainly not going to convince me to ask that more such things go into the game.[/quote]<P>However, they do exist in the game, in great numbers.  Bards can be balanced by giving us the option to use them, as other classes have, or by taking these items away from the other classes.  The availability of items to a particular class is a balance issue.  To simply say that you don't like this type of item and oppose the creation of more of them fails to address this balance issue.<P>[quote]"Generally what I found is that power for all classes rises proportional to level squared, except for bards. For bards power rises proportional to level."<P>And he may have been right. But also, keep in mind that most bard songs remain useful for the life of the bard. This is completely unique to the class, and requires a completely different scheme of increasing power.[/quote]<P>Yes, bard songs increase in power and remain with us for most of the game.  However, this is already balanced by the availability of far fewer spells.<P>[quote]&gt;"Dirge (level 43 song). Mana cost is 800. Bards don't benefit from any form of mana regen, so 800 mana takes 40 minutes to regenerate sitting, 80 minutes to regenerate standing. The song does about 311-340 points AE damage to a maximum of 4 targets. Could you please reappraise the mana cost on this song? We can't meditate so if you factor in sitting mana regen time, this song does best-case (4 targets) 0.6 dam/sec."&lt;<P>But you also don't suffer any ill effects for being low on mana, with the exception of the use of this song. So I don't see this as a big problem. All it does is determine how many times you can use the Dirge in any given time period. Unlike other casters, it does nothing to prevent you from using all of your other songs.[/quote]<P>RED FLAG TIME!!!<P>Wrong wrong wrong.  Our lvl 39 charm spell also requires mana.  Because charm is such a HUGE part of what I can add to a group, intentionaly going OOM by singing dirge is something I will never do.  Note that bards are also severely hampered by being ressurected as well.  What would be so bad about allowing mana regen songs to increase our mana pool?  If you have to, put dirge on a timer like LoH and HT.<P>[quote]&gt;"3. Song instance creation at the same point that old instance fades erases both old and<BR>new instance of the song. Very very annoying when you're selo's cuts out while kiting a<BR>mob."&lt;<P>I consider this a very minor bug. It can't be very common. But I'll add it to the list.[/quote]<P>Grumble grumble... and you thought the selo's bug was a minor annoyance as well.  First of all, it's fairly common.  Fairly minor unless it happens w/selo's for escape or charm, in which case the mob is tagged as charmed (can't attack it) but isn't charmed (beats up on you or your party).  <P>Let's assume that this minor bug occurs once per every 1,000 song starts.  That would mean it happens .5% of the time.  Doesn't sound bad does it?  However...  Since most bards twist song almost continuously from the time they log on to the time they log off, that means about once per 333 seconds.<P>[quote]&gt;"Song stacking <BR>You simply need to fix the stacking problem. I hate having to constantly stop cantina for<BR>clarity or regen songs. I hate playing level 50 song and having the enc wonder why sos<BR>isn't sticking. Quite simply make it so bard songs dont prevent songs from being casted,<BR>and prevent a slower bard haste effect from ruining a better haste effect. "&lt;<P>Ok, on the list.[/quote]<P>Just want to make sure we're clear here.  The problem is NOT that the song does not stack with the spell.  The problem is that the spell can not be cast while the song is in effect.  Most of the time, it's just a matter of the shaman saying "Hey bard, can you stop the heal song so I can cast regen" which is annoying but ok.  however, if Regen goes down mid battle it gets a lot dicier.  <P>[quote]&gt;"Basically, bard charm VERY OFTEN goes into "effect", IE you get the message, and you can't charm anything else, but you have no real control over the creature. The problem is that your pet will not attack you, but frequently attacks your other party members, and of course, your other party members can't effect your pet and you can't control it. It is one of the most annoying bugs I've encountered, and it isn't being fixed."&lt;<P>Messy. I'll put it on the list.[/quote]<P>This is one of two bugs with bard charm.  The other thing that happens is that the charm is successful, but a party member's pet has managed to work its way high enough onto the mob's hate list that the charmed mob now turns on the pet.  My guess is that the mob considers the pet an NPC and thus a fair target.  The solution to this is to order the mob to /pet back off, target the correct target and /pet attack.  No problem for an enchanter, who has plenty of time w/ his new found pet.  However, since bard charm lasts a max of nine seconds, by the time you've figured out what's happening and have control of the charmed mob again, charm is ready to break.  Essentialy, this bug greatly reduces the use of the charm song, particularly in groups w/ pets.<P>[quote]&gt;"The stuff about possibly making a negative move to make things balaced... He says that in the start of all the threads, he is not suggesting it anymore for bards then someone else. Sheesh."&lt;<P>I have started doing that with all of them. It's partially to cover my behind if I do end up with a nerf on my list. But mostly it's there because it's true.[/quote]<P>Please understand how touchy the bard community is about this subject.  We have been the unintended victim of so many accidental nerfs we get jumpy.  Not only that, but there have been a few instances of key songs being nerfed intentionaly with nothing being said.  We get nervous with the N word...<P>[quote]&gt;"1. Range on travel type songs is too low"&lt;<P>If I remember correctly, they were recently increased. But I can add it to the list.[/quote]<P>Ok, this is a big one with me, particularly in the post kunark world.  Here's why:<P>Kunark is composed of a lot of very large very graphic intensive out door worlds.  Idealy, everyone in your group would have a fast computer with a lot of memory and a high end video card.  However, we all know that this isn't true.  In these large worlds, player movement speeds vary due to frame rate issues.  I don't understand the issues well enough to tell you if their average movement rate remains constant with huge variances in their short range movement or if frame rate actualy slows down their average movement rate as well.  The point, however, is that selo's being limited by range and players moving at different rates due to varying computer power means that in Kunark in particular, players often fall out of range of selo's.  When this happens, the whole party must either wait or circle back, eliminating the major benefit of the song: faster movement.  I'm at the point where I won't even try to move parties through kunark w/ selos, prefering instead to rely on sLow, or insisting that the rest of the party use sLow while I zoom on ahead.<P> <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>QUOTE<BR>---<P>&gt;"You need to make sure the people designing this stuff understand that bards are a plate class."&lt;<P>Just because a bard CAN wear plate, that does not mean that all of the armor pieces designed for bards MUST have plate armor class. That's a false assumption. I agree that the designers need to keep the idea in mind, but don't go overboard.<P>&gt;"Skill caps on defensive skills"&lt;<P>From what I'm hearing, bards, paladins and shadow knights are all 'defensive' hybrids. I'll add a suggestion to increase the defense caps of all three to the lists.<P>&gt;"5) Offer Bards Double Attack, capped at a low level (anything to give us useable melee skills)."&lt;<P>Here's how it goes.<P>Bards, shadow knights and paladins are the defensive hybrids and they get the defensive stuff. They will not get both double attack AND dual wield. Rangers are the offensive hybrid, and they get both skills (I think…) and in exchange they lose out on the defensive skills.<P>---<P>Now just read what you've wrote, doesn't it sound a little contradictive?<P>It's quite a surprise to me when I heard bards are 'defensive' hybrids. I've been playing a bard for 2 years (almost) and this is the first time that I've heard bards are suppose to be 'defensive' hybrids.<P>When was the last time I tanked some mob that's about my level range and doesn't beat the XXXX out of me? I've tried to solo green snow cougars in Iceclad Ocean and without using fear kite and just one of those 'green' mobs can easily claw me down to 2 bub hp.<P>Besides, if bards were 'defensive' hybrids, why so many of our armor pieces are only chain class AC? There are also quite a few plate class armor that we cannot use. Even you said that we aren't suppose to get plate class armors.<P>Most level 55+ bards with superb gears have an average unbuffed AC of 900-920, and even level 60 bards only have an average unbuffed hp of 1500.<P>Compare the AC to the other defensive hybrids and you know we just can't tank anything at all. <P>It's good to hear that you are going to revise the cap on our defensive skills, but we are getting those skills just too late into the game. (Parry at 54 and Riposite at 58) <P>And even with a higher cap, with such low ac and hp we still can't tank anything 1/3 as good as a SK/Paladin, and not even 1/5 as good as a warrior.<P>In fact, if you compare our AC and HP to that of rangers, we aren't any better. I've seen rangers of the same level range tanks *better* than bards.<P>If that's really the case, Absor, why not just define bards as 'offensive' hybrids? <P>We never had and probably never will have the ability to tank good enough to become 'defensive' hybrids, as I'm sure Verant won't go overboard and go change the AC of all our armors, increase our base AC and HP and give us a increase in defensive skills cap all at once.<P>As it stands, bards will never be able to tank anything and no one with the slightest clue would allow a bard to tank anything without having to chain heal them.<P>On the other hand, if we were 'offensive' hybrids, and given skill like Double Attack, we could directly increase our melee damage output to any group almost instantly, and we're not asking for skills cap anything close to that of rangers, just low caps to slightly increase our melee output.<P>If that's indeed granted to us, I'm sure bards won't mind Verant to leave all the AC as is (as we're now 'offensive' hybrids), or those plate armor that we can't use.<P>We're looking at an overboard changes to all AC and defensive skills related issue for bards, or a simple addition of one new melee skill, I think the latter is a much more reasonable choice.<P>EQ has evolved a lot since it has been released, and I think it's a good time to take a look at bard as a whole.<P>What do you think, Absor?<P>My 2 coppers.<P>- Solos Chimamire<BR>- Mithaniel Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Kaearia and Thott are right on target.<P>If you only make one positive change to the bard class-- and I think it's obvious that, in the 50+ game, bards need a substantial boost in power-- make it haste stacking.<P>Bards have significant problems at high levels.  In traditional xp groups (tanks/crowd control), the *only* situations in which a bard is preferable to a chanter is where the bard's admittedly impressive (but still around 5th best on the depth chart) pulling abilities come into play or where the group is sufficiently healer-deficient as to have to depend on bard-healing.  <P>(Bard-healing, by nature, cannot be used as spot heals, and therefore if you have a bad run of unlucky mob hits against a player in a primarily bard-healed group, someone's gonna die.)<P>Otherwise, chanters are flat-out better than bards.<P>EVEN if bard haste was as fast as chanter haste-- which it's not-- chanters would still be better than bards for trad xp groups.  They mez better.  Their mana regen is more dependable.  Chanter slows are so much better than bard slows, it beggars description.<P>Are there good things about the bard? Yes.  Bards are and remain the best possible puller for AoE groups.  In fact, bards are and remain among the best finesse pullers around.<P>The downside is that finesse pulls are generally only important when your group is doing something that it really doesn't have the levels for, and otherwise you'd rather have a warrior doing faster brute-force pulling of 2-3 mobs at a time.<P>Where bards really fall down is in raid situations.  I have exactly one song at level 55 that constitutes a substantial contribution to a battle against any epic encounter: Occlusion of Sound, because it stacks with everything I've seen and it makes it easier for the casters to do their thing.  I have *no* new songs currently in-game that remotely justify using me in an epic encounter over yet another warrior, rogue, monk, or even other hybrid melee.  <P>Either make all of bard hastes stack-- in which case bards will be the optimal 6th man in a group in a VERY limited number of possible groups-- or up the haste percentage on the Ervaj songs to the point where it makes sense to use them.  As others have pointed out, this point is around 45%.<P>Many of the other issues that Kaearia has pointed to in her excellent compilition post should also be addressed, and IMO a few nerfs to the bard class are also in order-- bard soloing ability from 27-45, for instance, is now completely out of whack, and should be answered by the addition of a mana cost to the 27 charm.<P>But if you're going to make only one positive change, make it haste stacking.  It won't unbalance the game (see stats on bard as 6th man vs. rogue as 6th man WITH haste stacking.)  It will make every bard and every melee class in Everquest deleriously happy.<P>                    --Jylieu McKenna<BR>                      Defiant<BR>                      Vallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Not sure if this has been said yet and don't want to wade through 5 pages os stuff to check, but this is about the 'song ends' 'song starts' 'song ends' bug.<P>From my experience with this, there seems to be 2 timers on song effects, one on the server and one on the client.<P>You see this best when you are in danger of going LD. No info is being passed from the server during this time, but the client knows that the song effect is fading, and expires the effect as normal, therefore there must be a client side timer on this.<P>However, you will also notice that during those times then you almost go LD and then come back, that certain song effects that should have been refreshed have been expired on the server, again when there was no info passing between client and server, therefore there must also be a timer on effects on the server.<P>Now, this bug takes place more when there is lag, so what I am assuming is that the timer on the client starts before the timer on the server. The client timer expires and the song is cancelled on the client, just before it is refreshed, but then the timer on the server expires and cancels the song again before that timer is refreshed.<P>A question, when you say you cannot re-produce this bug, are you testing on machines with a direct connection to the server ? Try connecting through an external ISP that gives normal lag, get into a full group in one of the kunark dungeons to increase the lag effects, and try to keep 3 songs up. You will see the problem multiple times during each fight.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>My two cents on the bard issue:<BR>Basically I agree with most points made, there are soo many posts already up that I can't possibly say which ones I agree/disagree with but most seem in the right direction.  My two greatest complaints about the bard class are the declining usefulness in a group with an enchanter and shaman and the SS gear.  <P>The first topic has been thoroughly discussed already but I thought I'd pursue the SS issue.  All the previous posts have been right, SS gaunts and bracers are the only useful parts.  The rest as was stated earlier do not allow us to do something we couldn't do, and are pathetic if you compare them to the effects of armors on other classes.  <P>Singing Steel Helm - Eye of Zomm is almost completely useless.  Not only does it not last very long, but it aggros mobs like crazy.<BR>The only time I use this is when I get severely bored and summon an eye, then proceed to kill it, prompting a good laugh from the others around me.<P>Singing Steel Boots - Same deal, was already mentioned that since bards get forage, by the time we get these boots we have already maxed our foraging skill and as a result forage regularly.  Similarly with the helm, I've found a good way to pass the time prior to hate raids and getting seb groups is to draw my name on the floor with summoned water....it's not much more useful than that.<P>Singing Steel Greaves - ***?!  Honestly, I think this is the single worst effect of the Singing Steel set.  The boots were more useful because foraging does not turn up water as much as food...which can make it good in certain desert situtations.  However, summoning food is completely pointless as most of us bards have full backpacks of foraged food at all times.  To top it off, this item comes off an incredibly difficult mob, Venril Sathir, and should as such be better than other pieces(short of the BP) due to the difficulty in obtaining it.<P>Singing Steel Arms - This has been covered pretty well.  We have to completely stop singing to cast this, which is pointless considering we have the Jig o Vigor which achieves the same effect, but on a full party.<P>Suggestions:<BR>Unlike a couple other posts, I do enjoy songs being placed on items, albeit the Melodic BP has a bad combination, but the Breath of Harmony was a good idea.  The right-clickable effect has no startup, stop, or recast time which makes it somewhat useful as it can be easily twisted in with whatever the bard happens to be playing.  However, I do not think that putting songs on armor pieces is a good idea.  BoH, in my opinion, is as far as putting songs on equipment should go.  Anymore than that and you begin to get into issues where too many songs can be twisted and the whole point of memorizing and playing songs diminishes.  I advocate the position that SS should have spells or effects that we cannot normally achieve(which can be difficult due to our versatility).<P>Finally, my suggestions for new effects:<P>Amplification of Songs(ie instruments) - This may seem way out there, but I think it should be considered an option.  I'm not sure how your implementation of song amplification works, but I think it would be really neat if each piece added a small percent to our singing or instrumental effects.  It is after all called "Singing Steel".  Maybe have the bracers add 5% to singing each, while the helm added 5-10% to percussion, vams maybe 5-10% brass, etc.  Also, make this "amplification" stackable with instruments. Although this would not fit what seems to be your vision of Kunark Armor(doing things that we couldn't on our own), just consider your current implementation and how it reflects that vision.  This would make the pieces much more desirable as well, probably comparable to the desire other classes have for their armor. (honestly I try to get all mine more for the look, the status it represents, the AC, and lastly the effects, most classes try to get certain pieces because they greatly aid the class somehow through the effects( i.e. jb bracer, cobalt bp, dw helm, etc)<P>Perhaps an alternative to this idea is to make each piece cast a self-only buff that does not stack with effects from other pieces but will stack with instruments and amplifies a certain instrument/singing.<P>Transportation - Although other classes may be the kings of transportation, no one rivals us in terrestial movement.  I would probably have qualms about this but I think a gate spell or two would be very handy on the SS.  I would propose one piece having a gate that took them to a tavern in Qeynos, and the other to a tavern in Kelethin.  Honestly, I detest Faydwer and I avoid that continent at all costs, but Kelethin and Qeynos are the two cities I would consider as bard centers of the world.  With Qeynos being the home to half elf bards, and Kelethin the home of wood elf bards.  Humans bards are just freaks imho.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Proc - paladins, shadow knights, and rangers all have spells that can add a proc to their weapons.  Bards seemed to have been left out of this bunch.  I think adding an effect casting a similar self-only spell would be appropriate and well received.  Paladins have a stun, rangers a DD, SKs a lifetap.  To make bards unique, I think it would be interesting to give us a mana drain spell proc.  It would pretty much be limited to helping with gating mobs, but I think it would be handy and yet not overpower us in anyway.  The proc could drain 100 mana or so everytime.  This isn't much considering the amount of mana that certain mobs have, but if it procs once or twice in a long fight it could help and yet not be an unfair advantage.  The inconsistency of procs also adds to making this a feasible option.  In all honesty, i would love a stun, lifetap, or DD in that order, but those seem to have been already taken and it would be nice to have something to call our own as the other classes do.  Perhaps another choice as a proc would be something similar to the SSS.  Maybe a small stackable, heal, AC buff, STR buff, hp buff, whatever, take your pick.<P>If the above changes seem out of the question, maybe something along the summoning lines would be considered.  Perhaps instead of water, the boots could summon ale, or the party packs that magicians get.  It would fit the bard character, and would just be more fun to have than plain old water.<P>Other Bard related issues:<P>Twitch!! - Ok, our mana is well estabalished as useless.  Of the two songs that us it, neither needs it.  Dirge could easily have a recast time put on it, while charm isn't used often enough and even then is resisted a lot at higher levels so was never a threat to allowing bards to solo.  So...I think instead of a last ditch type of song like Dirge, we should get something, maybe on SS or a new song that lets us twitch other party members.  We seem to have about 1.5k mana or so at higher levels, if there was an effect or song that transferred mana to other party members at the same ratio as a necro it would be very useful.  We couldn't do it regularly like a necro, but it would help in "desparate" situations where the cleric or enchanter is low and would put a use to that mana that we've accumulated.  <P>Double Attack - ok, bards got the short end of the stick on this and I'm sure that's well established by now.  Paladins having Double Attack only, lets them use a shield.  Rangers have both.  Since bards only have dual wield we are in effect doing the same damage as a paladin(actually a lot less), but don't get the added bonus of a shield.  I agree all bards in typical RPGs have dual wield but I think we should also get Double Attack.  Perhaps not to the extent that any of the other classes get it, but maybe cap it at 80-100 or so.  Allowing it to go off now and then putting us closer to paladins are but not as high as rangers.  Paladins with double attack more often that not do much more damage than a bard because their weapons are better.  I.E. SoM, FD, ND, etc.  I agree their weapons should be better, but the gap between us and them is too great in my opinion.<P>Well, this concludes my contribution to the bard balance board.  I hope you have time to read all these and will consider our suggestions.  The SS and the grouping-with-an-enchanter issues are the biggest in my opinion.  With the naming of Singing Steel and the current lack of appropriate effects, I hope you can seriously consider having each cause an instrument-type effect.<P>Sanctus Mirtarr<BR>54 Bard of Qeynos<BR>Lanys T'vyl<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

This is a minor issue that has been brought up since day one. <BR> ___________<P>NOR_Bard posted, but someone else wrote:<P>&gt;"In general, melee damage triples from 50 to 60 and spell damage increases 50%. Bard "spell" damage is really a form of melee damage, since the damage is slow yet takes no mana. Yet for some reason it follows a lesser curve than regular spell damage. I have no idea why."&lt;<P>Well, because you are comparing 1 song to all of the melee damage done by a rogue (why not pick a warrior, or a caster?). Now, add the other things that the bard does into the equation, and let's talk further. Look at damage by twisting two songs plus the damage done by increasing the attack speed of that same rogue. Or look at the increased damage of that rogue when bard hasted, and the increased damage output of the wizard under the mana song AND whatever third song you want to sing…<P>I'll agree that perhaps we should look at the damage dealing ability of the bard. But I'm not convinced that it's too low by this argument, as it fails to include all the other things that a bard does. It's kind of like saying that an enchanter doesn't ramp up his damage as fast as a rogue after 50th level. Bards are not just about damage dealing.<BR> _______________<P> Ok, i have to bite at this one. Mainly because what the poster tries to say is true. Bards melee abilities rise marginally past 50th, with a few new skills that cap so low that they're almost useless. Bards songs , the new ones, past 50th, really dont add to much to a groups damage ability, or a bard damage ability. Our hastes raise 10%, if you give up the 30 points to str/agil. Or, if you want to keep the str/attk you can drop haste 18% for an 8 point dmg shield.. this is , of course, assuming you're not burned by getting to 57th to get this great song. Lets not forget that bards get that great melee skill, riposte.. of course, you have to wait until 58th (??) to get it, and of course, thats capped extremely low too. <BR>  Like every class that has melee in its makeup, we as bards recieved a marginal increase to defense. Since it was passed to you that bards are a defensive hybrid, other than that sad parry skill, would you mind pointing out where we got any kind of a defensive increase past 50th , to reflect our defensive role?<BR>   On the power of songs being added to out total makeup of increased power past 50th? Other than a big new clarity for the group, could you point out what songs we're suppose to have that are greater just as songs, compared to a song we had before 50th? We got an aoe snare, ok, forgot that one.. aoe.. snare.. random time duration? hmm.<BR>Oh, wait, we get a new DD/stun! , its lvl 55, and does less than a dirge attack, and its not aoe? Oh, of course, it has the new timer for it, so it doesn't use mana, like the dirge should in the first place.<BR> BTW, after using a dirge, a bard will have about 20% mana.. or about 4-6 applications of our lvl 39 charm song left, how is this not crippling us?<P>oooh.. got carried away there.. sorry.<BR> ________________<P><BR>&gt;"Solution: Remove the "soft cap" if it exists. Improve the player resist rate against these high-end targets with maximum resist, so that there's a significant benefit to getting up near 255. Double-check to make sure there's no roll-over bug when resists exceed 255 (or whatever the max is in your code)."&lt;<P>I know nothing! I'll look into this.<BR> ____________<P> Considering the difficulty and buffing involved in getting ones resists to 255 in any one field, and considering the damage of high end spells being cast at characters from mobs, there is very little benifit to having a high resist vs kunark and SoV type boss mobs. This low benifit takes away from the old bards duties in the old days of vox and naggy, where a bard could make a party almost invulnerable to dragon fear, and lower the aoe dmg dramatically. Not sure why or where, but the newer mobs that are vox/naggy comparison look/react at high resists as if non existant.<BR>  _______________<P><BR>&gt;"Comparing Rondo (57) to our level 54 song is a joke. If you're singing Rondo, a mob hitting your party on average 1.5 times every 3 sec will take 4 dam/sec from the damage shield. For the damage shield to offset the 23% loss in haste, your party must be doing less than 12 dam/sec melee damage for Rondo to be better than Celerity2…<P>…<P>Please either fix hastes/slows so an instrument increases them, or change these songs to have double their current haste/slow (optionally making them instrument-only)."&lt;<P>This whole part of your discussion got completely confusing. You are trying to compare the haste component on a haste only song with a song that does several things (not just haste and damage shield). My first thought would be that of course the haste will be less when you get a ton of other bonuses with the song.<P>Frankly, I am very dubious of any comparison of things that are rather closer to apples than oranges. But I'll add the request to the list, and we'll hash it out internally a bit.<P>And, once again, comparing song with the spells for classes is a tough thing to do, and may not always be a fair comparison.<P>By the way, none of your links are complete…<BR>   _________________<P> Lvl 57 song is a combat buff song, lvl 54 is a combat buff song, that orange sure looks like an apple too. See the second response above, i made mention of the sad effects of this song.<P>   _________________<P>&gt;"- The BP is a self-only 100 point heal with a 12 second cast time. In 12 seconds, a level 50 bard using a Plane of Hate lute can heal 80 hp for each party member. I don't even know what the point is making the BP's heal self-only. <P>- The vambraces have an effect of Invigorate - a targeted stamina replenishment. Our level 3 song replenishes stamina for the entire party. Our level 34 song does it while healing and giving mana."&lt;<P>Ok, I can see it. The logic might have been that this is a 'free spell slot' for bards, but since you will have that song memorized to help your party, the clickable effects are not really useful.<P>&gt;"- The boots summon 1 water at a time with a 5 second cast time. PLEASE change this to summon 10 or 20 at a time so it's at least useful. As it is, I just buy my water in bulk instead of taking 2 minutes to summon a stack of water that'll all disappear every time I go linkdead. <BR>- The greaves summon 1 food at a time. See boots above."&lt;<P>Welcome to the world of magicians…<P>Here I find it very easy to argue that not all items are supposed to be super useful. These two can save you a trip to town and allow you to put it off until a more convenient time. It's certainly not the most awesome effect in game, but that's not really a good argument.<BR> __________________<BR> <BR>A bard constantly sings to have thier buff/effects on, a caster does not. We have to drop all that we are doing and buffing to enact these effects, in the process, loosing that "spell like effect". We cannot use clickable effects while singing, but yet that caster that just cast thier buff/spell can, while thier effect is in no danger of dropping. In essence, we kinda pay double penalty for being a bard in this matter. And before you argue its manaless, lets remember most of our songs are washed down versions of other spell effects, the benifit mainly gained because it is manaless. <P> Welcome to the world of Bards!<BR>______________________________<P>&gt;"This nerf affects us even when we aren't fearing, and you didn't compensate us for it in any way."&lt;<P>To be fair, you should know that this is a red flag for me. Compensation for a needed change (even if it was a nerf) is never something I will support. Show me how this change unbalanced the class or something, but don't tell me that you deserve more power because something was taken away… if it was made weaker, it was because it needed to be weaker. There is no compensation.<P> ______<BR> Awhile back, a bug was discovered that caused the reduction of the max move base slow down from our snare songs to equal no greater than some necro's snare. Why we cannot have a snare that doesn't slow something down more than a necro snare is beyond me, because it did before the fix.<BR>I think this is where everyone is upset, our random duration snare at least slowed them down more than those other set duration snares from other classes. Many were lead to believe this was the benifit involved. When this was taken away, well, you can probably see why they're upset over this.<BR> __________________<P>&gt;"Chain, Largo's Absonant Binding (51), and Assonant Strane (L54 AE movement slowdown) are all random in duration. They could last the full 12 seconds, they could wear off immediately. No other movent slowdown spells in the game have a random duration, even though the spell versions last 10-50 times longer than Chain. It can't be because Chain has a slow component attached because no other slow spells in the game have a random duration either. I hear all the movement slowdowns except the level 1 snare used to be random duration, and were gradually changed to have a fixed guaranteed duration - except the bard ones."&lt; <P>A logical enough argument. And you weakened it with this last line:<P>&gt;"In light of the above one-sided nerf, perhaps you could give these songs a guaranteed 12 second duration?"&lt;<P>But it does not invalidate your point.<P>"Generally what I found is that power for all classes rises proportional to level squared, except for bards. For bards power rises proportional to level."<P>And he may have been right. But also, keep in mind that most bard songs remain useful for the life of the bard. This is completely unique to the class, and requires a completely different scheme of increasing power.<P>  _______________<P>And that scheme is built in, most of the time, instead of the song/spell effect raising every lvl to cap lvl like a casters does, a bard sees only an increase about every 6 levels. Past 50th lvl, this means we see one increase, maybe two, vs the casters getting whatever effect/spells increased from 49th to cap, as well as any spells they get before 60th, increasing every level as well. This is a MAJOR sore point of mine, and a real balance issue for bards.<BR> ______________________<P>&gt;"At high levels, that margin simply doesn't exist. The 10% haste on the level 60 song doesn't come anywhere close to giving us the 45% haste advantage that's needed to keep us in line with the other melee classes."&lt;<P>One of us is making a logical error here... Bardic hastes are not, primarily, designed to make the bard into damage dealer comparable to a warrior. That's not the intent. The intent is that the bards can improve the melee ability of his entire group by that amount. Keep in mind, bards were designed from the ground up to be a party based class.<P>&gt;"Dirge (level 43 song). Mana cost is 800. Bards don't benefit from any form of mana regen, so 800 mana takes 40 minutes to regenerate sitting, 80 minutes to regenerate standing. The song does about 311-340 points AE damage to a maximum of 4 targets. Could you please reappraise the mana cost on this song? We can't meditate so if you factor in sitting mana regen time, this song does best-case (4 targets) 0.6 dam/sec."&lt;<P>But you also don't suffer any ill effects for being low on mana, with the exception of the use of this song. So I don't see this as a big problem. All it does is determine how many times you can use the Dirge in any given time period. Unlike other casters, it does nothing to prevent you from using all of your other songs.<P> ___________________<P> Read second response, i got carried away and posted about this up above. 8(<BR> ___________________<P>Ro-kenn said:<P>&gt;"What 'negative changes' do you have in mind Absor?"&lt;<P>Well, I'm already planning on complaining about the lute that allows bards to change into werewolves. And if anything else comes up, I'll add it to my list. Right now, that's the only thing I have that I know of.<P> _______________<BR> Ok, another sore point. Being of theatrical background, bards and rogues are prone to having to "Disguise", since no such skill exists in EQ, and it is considered a class based skill similar in importance to a warriors dual attack, in that is defines the class and saves thier &lt;bleep&gt; heh, it seems VI has put in these various "illusion" items for the rogues and bards. Remember the above response to balancing a class with items in the game? If this does not pertain to that idealogy of the wrong type of class balancing, it falls so close, there would be no visible grey between. Bards and rogues should have had a disguise skill, then this type of fix wouldn't have been neeeded.<BR>  ____________________<P><BR>&gt;"Skill caps on defensive skills"&lt;<P>From what I'm hearing, bards, paladins and shadow knights are all 'defensive' hybrids. I'll add a suggestion to increase the defense caps of all three to the lists.<BR>  ______________<BR> see responses above on this, second one again i think.<BR>  ______________<P><BR>Baramore wrote:<P>&gt;"5) Offer Bards Double Attack, capped at a low level (anything to give us useable melee skills)."&lt;<P>Here's how it goes.<P>Bards, shadow knights and paladins are the defensive hybrids and they get the defensive stuff. They will not get both double attack AND dual wield. Rangers are the offensive hybrid, and they get both skills (I think…) and in exchange they lose out on the defensive skills.<P> ______________<P> Bards are a hybrid when it suites VI, but not a hybrid when it doesn't. I'm sorry, but that is getting sooooooo old. If we're a hybrid, fine, so be it. But if we're a jack of all trades, then by god, give us something that seems essential to any true melee. You'd think we could learn it to some degree.<BR> ________________<P>Aanani wrote:<P>&gt;"Another issue is the recast time on our level 55 song, Brusco's Bombastic Bellow, (222 direct damage). Currently at a 5 minute recast, I dont know of a single Bard that keeps it memorised. 222 damage is an extremely small ammount of damage to require such a long recast. A huge delay reduction would be required to make it usefull, something in the neighborhood of an 12 second recast."&lt;<P>That does seem like a long recast.<P>Razamanaz said:<P>&gt;"1. Range on travel type songs is too low"&lt;<P>If I remember correctly, they were recently increased. But I can add it to the list.<P>Baerd wrote:<P>&gt;"- Casting animation on bard songs. We are bards, we play our instruments...we don't cast spells. I should not be swinging my arms over my head while playing my Chant series or while playing Niv's Melody of Preservation."&lt;<P>But aren't bards supposed to look silly?<P>Ok, that's my first pass on bards. It may be a while before I post here again, but I will be reading and adding new suggestions to the list. So keep posting good ideas.<P>Alan<P> _________________<P> Doing a great job so far Alan/Absor! <P>Jhade<P><BR> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Particle Effects are most important to a Bard and are not working as expected.  It would be of benefit to all players if the Particle effects mechanism was fixed/enhanced.  <P>Bards determine when to twist via various means.  The most important of this is our visual clues as to when our song activates.  Our songs give us this visual clues via Particle Effects.  But unfortunately having Particle Effects on can make the game unplayable in many situations.  <P>The particle Effects settings are not working as players expect.  Low, Medium, and High particle effects all produce the same amount of Spell particle effects (though they may reduce rain and such).  This leaves just two Particle Effects settings in regards to spells and song, Off and not off.  <P>When Particle effects are off a few of our songs still have reduced effects (such as reduced healing blue flashes).  This is great (but what we would expect from a Low setting not an Off setting).  Other songs have no Visual Effects in the Off setting making it difficult for the Bard to know when to twist.  This is very important for a bard.  We cannot play with effects on and we cannot twist as correctly with them off.  What we are looking for is a Low setting which actually works.  <P>We hope for a Low particle Effects setting which reduces most of the Song Particle Effects while Still leaving minimal Visual Clues.  This is currently in place for the off setting for some songs like healing, so it is possible to do.  Please implement minimal particle effects for all songs when the Low setting is in place.  It is what your players expect the setting to do and it is benefit to all players, not just bards, and would do well to enhance the gaming experience.  <P>Thanks,<BR>RADIA,<BR>54th<BR>Cazic-Thule<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052807-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052807.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052807-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052807-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052807-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052807-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052807-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052807&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052807&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
