Everything, except the 2 crowns, on this list is available around level 30, and most of it is ALL/ALL.  I got my Lockjaw Vest when I was level 12 for 20 plat (which was a lot for me way back then).  If we can these items VERY EASILY in a pickup group, or simply buy them for a small amount of plat, why is it that, except for the shiver boots, every single  item of our planes armor is overshadowed by ALL/ALL equipment that is easy to get?  You may say that the shiver has nice stat modifiers, and I would agree, but all of us know thats stats dont really affect combat they way it should.  AC is king for the melee classes, and shiverback AC is simply too low in every case to be useful for a monk by the time he/she is able to get to the planes to get it.  I really dont think it would be unreasonable or unbalancing for shiverback AC to be modified so that the AC at least is equal to the lowest AC of equipment that is otherwise common equipment for monks.  If you want to reduce the other +WIS/INT/DEX/STA whatever, thats fine, as long as the AC is raised to at least the AC of something we already use and can easily get.<P>Draggoon Slayer<BR>54 Rodcet Nife<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>First of all, these ocmments apply primarily to the 50+ game<P>With all due respect, if a monk doesn't do damage between a warrior and rogue, what is a monk's role in a group?<P>A monk is not capable of being a main tank, so that's out.  We don't have the HPs to surive against Kunark or Velious mobs in this role.  We have high AC, but when we get hit, it's usually for max or close to max damage.<P>So a monk is a secondary tank in a group.  But what would the compelling reason be to take a monk over a 2nd warrior?  The warrior does nearly as much damage, and can take a much bigger beating.  Since aggro is based mostly on # attacks and not actual damage, warriors have trouble getting a mob off of a monk.  What about a rogue?  A rogue does about twice as much damage as a monk, and with a competent main tank will take a minimal amount of damage because of Evade.  What about a hybrid melee?  Sure, the monk does more damage, but the Pallies and SKs tank better than a monk, and all the melee hybrids bring more versatility to the group than a monk does.<P>OK, what about pulling?  Prior to Kunark, monks were desired in groups for feign pulling, a practice which Verant very publicly frowns on.  In Kunark and Velious, the advantage in pulling was taken away, both by modification of mob behavior and the impact of higher levels on aggro ranges.<P>Raally, what all the above posts come down to is defining what a monk brings to a group, either in a standard hunting group or in a raid situation.  Basedo n past communications and EQ manuals, the definition that Verant has provided is that we do more damage toe-to-toe than any other class, with only a backstabbing rogue able to surpass us.<P>Aganerral Pardus<BR>57th Master<BR>Erollisi Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor, <P>The roles of classes are easily described here.<P>Warriors = main tank, great AC, great HP, damn good dmg ability.<P>Rogues = Supposed to have semi poor AC (not currently) and lower hps than a tank (also not currently, since their HPs usually match a Pally/SK), do Awesome dmg above all other melee (absolutely) and have some useful skills.<P>Monks = in between these 2 classes. Monks have the HPs of a Rogue, yet get an added attack that is generally only decent (i.e.) flying kick. They have a natural AC bonus to "HIT AVOIDANCE" (there are 2 types of AC, damage avoidance and damage mitigation). That is why their armor generaly BLOWS CHUNKS i.e. 6 ac armor against lets say a warrior 40AC armor piece.<P>They have 2 defining abilities. Doing DARN GOOD DMG while Dodging/Blocking attacks very well (this makes up for the lack of good AC armor and Lack of a Warriors HPS), and the ability to Feign death. That is what a monk is. <P>The problem arises when against uber mobs, There is no avoidance of their attacks, they hit every time, and since Monks have low hps and small Damage mitigation AC, they get hit for Full dmg like a caster when they are hit. That is why they ask for higher skill caps, or better armor.<P>Then when they are being slaughtered against these Uber Mobs, they notice that warriors are doing as much if not more than the monk in Dmg. Why play a monk at all if a warrior can tank, Taunt, Slam, have Unreal AC, and do as much dmg as a monk?<P>WHY IS STUN AN ISSUE?????<P>Basically verant gave all mobs over lvl 50 a COMPLETELY overpowering ability to kill a full 45 person raid in a matter of seconds. It is called GATE SUMMONING. <P>Here are the steps:<BR>1) mobs over lvl 51 can summon you to them from anywhere in the zone, if you are aggro'd.<P>2)50+ mobs can easily kill a single character in seconds, especially if there is more than 1 mob hitting for 200+ a hit. <P>3)caster mobs now can GATE to their origionation point.<P>Conclusion:<P>When a wanderer mob adds to your battle, If you do not STUN it out of its casting of GATE (this is only ONE spell mind you), The mob gates to a spot where there are usually 5 to 10 mobs around, then summons characters across the zone to their utter death at its normal attack rate (1-2 seconds a pop). <P>THAT IS WHY EVERYONE NEEDS SOME FORM OF STUN. It is an outragously overpowered unresistable (if gate completes) anialation of a raid, and since monks have NO ABILITY TO STUN at all innately, they are at a major disadvantage to other melee classes. Stun is not something they need to just say they can do it, everyone needs it, just so you can stop this ONE outragous mob ability (think of the cleric BP and you will understand how bad this ability really is)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hmm, I tried a monk for a while but gave up after realizing that its just a fighter w/o weopons. Ok that might have been the original thought for having the class, but it never did much for me. I had hoped that EQ would have done a more interesting monk that followed the more mystical realm, but just to join the fighter band wagon here are some combat moves first:<BR>1 Higher level monks can turn their skin into armor sort of like the magicans armor spell. Its a personal thing. It takes chi power to do so, or just make it a skill thing that has a duration.<BR>2 A force push thats starts out like a simple gust of wind that air elementals cast. As the levels increase it can grow and become a number of things (take your pick here)A) a wind that really knocks the opponent back a few feet and knocks them down/stuns for a time. or B) can be used as a "keep away" force field that keeps the mob at bay ( insert bully holding whimp at bay with stiff arm on head here)<BR>3 How about a chi power that either disrupts a body's tissue or damages a weapon. Choose to lay waste to the mob at higher levels or drop mobs ac by 100pts or something. Unfortuantely our mobs dont really wear armor do they? hmmmm<BR>4 Mirror image .you know what I mean.<BR>non combat<BR>5 Cant we throw an opponent? I mean lets use hand to hand to throw (humanoid type monsters of regular size lets not throw giants please).<BR>1 Um levitate? Personal and not for other folks?<BR>2 Astral projection? A way to move your character to other zones to do exploration and reconisance(sp)cant carry anything or anything like that, but have a better duration than Eye of Zomm....and distance<BR>3 Walk thru walls? What a nice way to escape?<P>and some toys...doesnt have to be as much as a ninja, but I think one of the old console rpg games had  a ninja class  that used eggshell grenades (hello gnome tinkerers?!?!!?)pepper grenades net use <P>Lets see something different, dunno how much more they are gonna work on this game, but I'd like to see them step outta the box they are in. I take my hat off to them for doing a great job thus far, I dont agree with much of what has been done, but since I played since beta I suppose I cant complain too much! lol</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I just add here some personal toughts, which are shared by most of the monk of my server (The Nameless).<P>--------------------------------------------------<BR>Summary of issues<P>- solve FD bugs and make aggro clear on greens 100%<BR>- change ugly looking graphics for human female and make some nice looking items monk wearable if they are heavy enough.<BR>- add features to special attacks like bash.<BR>- enchance our armor with more resist stats and spells.<P>--------------------------------------------------<BR>1. FD issues<P>Verant stated that FD was not designed at first for pulling but as a way for the monk to escape death.<BR>Well now it works fine as a pulling method, but it does not work to save your life. In group situtions when the mob aggroes on you you would like to use FD to give the tanks more time to taunt and jump back up into the battle a little later. Well as lots of monks stated even on a successful FD the mob keep hitting you as if you were not FD. This problem MUST be corrected.<P>Some bugs with aggro clearing. You are supposed to have a close to 100% chance of aggro clear when the mob returns to it's bind point and roamers are conseidered to always be at there bind point regarding that issue. Well sometimes a mob just NEVER let go, when I have time I test it and I have FD'ed non stop on some mobs for 30+ min and those came back to me each time (statics or roamers). There is definitely a bug here.<P>Now as for improvements we would like to have a 100% aggro clear on green con mobs and this as soon as we FD. It sounds logical that green cons are supposed to be way less experienced creatures so they should have no chance to see through our well trained feign.<P><BR>--------------------------------------------------2. Armor looks<P>At level 60 we still look like newbies, it is way time that you look into this especialy after the work you have done with velious ! You have implemented tons of new graphics so how DARE you leave monks still look like newbies. Druids were said to be a leather limited class too but now they comonly wear chain and plate.<P>Ok will conceed you I am the only monk so far that I have met that puts looks before stats  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> but my claim is of interest to all monks.<P>First I play a human female character for which even basic graphics sucks. The leather look for gloves and leggings is plain UGLY, please redo them to look like males.<P>You introduced colored plate armor, great idea but why not colored leather armor ??<P>Our epic quest gloves look just like we have nothing on whereas every other class had a special design, this is unfair ! Please add a graphic for them. I would suggest something light, like bare hands but featuring a ying-yang tatoo or somehting else. Something that strikes the eyes as unusual.<BR>There is work to be done on the floating graphics that come from the gloves, you can't see them. You should add some depth to the design and chane the color or work on a 2 color combination, make them to be seen.<P>Monk can already wear a very few selected pieces of armor that have a plate look. I would like to have more choice at my disposal be cause I like to be well dresses on events and a robe is not a solution when we stand among the fighters. I must admit I fancy the plate looks too  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Monks don't were plate because it does not suit them for combat, they are not supposed to be forbidden to wear them though.<BR>I suggest you make more plate looking items wearable by monks. You concern is the too high ac we might get out of these but the solution to that is already in the game, it's our weight penalty ! A perfect example is the Black Chittin Legs, monk can wear them but they weight a lot so no one uses them for combat. I would take too loong to look all the items I agree so just work on player made plate maybe and definitely crystal chittin armor (they look great and I know the bp weights 15 so will never be used in combat).<P>The design of planar armor is great, just correct the one on gloves and legs for human females, make them look like male, or make the legs look like shorts ...<P><BR>Velious has prooved you have a great team of graphists so make use of them please.<P><BR>--------------------------------------------------<BR>3. Disciplines<P><BR>Stone Stance<P>It's not an immune to dammage disc so it could have it's duration increased a little to make it really worthwhile compared to Void Dance.<P><BR>ThunderKick<P>It is only used at level 60 when it's recast time does not too much prevent you to have another disc ready.<BR>Something should be done to make it worth using.<BR>Make it last only 40 seconds but make it apply to every kick during that time.<BR>If you agree to add a bash effect to the flying kick then the disc would also make the bash always successful.<BR>If you don't give a minimal dammage to special attacks then give the disc a minimal dammage. Lending a thunderkick for 2 is just ridiculous, it an powerful attack not a poke !<P><BR>4. Burning issues : armor and dammage<P>You don't want to give monks too much AC ? Sure but give them a minimum !<P>We are now all equiped at 90% to 100% in non monk only gear whereas the other classes have a few to mostly class only equipment.<BR>Did you make a mistake on making some items monk usable ? I don't think so because monk are barely balanced with their AC using all/all stuff. As I am equpiped now I don't think I can claim for more AC because monk are not designed to tank with AC.<BR>That is balanced by their supposed high damamge output and their spuerior ability to evade hits.<P>That was true before Kunark, it not anymore.<BR>Compared to other melee classes, especialy warriors, we have lost part oof our superiority as dammage dealing and evading abilities.<P><BR>Dammage dealing ...<P>Before RoK the best warrior weapon was Ikesha 8/24 (the proc is quite insignificant) and monk fists were 14/28. our dammage output was HALF BETTER !<BR>Now all melee classes get weapons better than fists ! We get some blunt weapons that are better too but not more with the same diffrence, it is WAY from that now.<P>We can't stand landing flying kicks for 1, it's a special attack not a joke. Reduce max dammage if you need to but put in a min dammage to your level for flying kick, level/x for other attacks.<P>Make special attacks chained if it can be coded. That would be, when a flying kick lands, a dragon puch is automaticaly tried with lower that usual chances of success ... Number of chainable attacks and success can increase with level.<P>Some of our combat skills have increased with RoK but we have lost some of our advantages over other melee. We can't go above the skill cap so maybe you could make monks gain a few attack points ever level above 50 to compensate.<P>You can give us better fist and weapon dammage/delay but I think the enhancement should be in other fields (special attacks ...). This could solve another pb at the same time, the desirability of a monk in a group where there is no need of FD pulling.<P>Stunning<P>Except in Norrath, in all the worlds I know monks are the masters of stunning. don't you think you should work monks in that way too in EQ ?<P>I understand that stun is a very powerful tool in EQ and must be dealt with utter care, though I would like you to look in that direction.<P>I think you should give a slight percentage chance to every swing to bash. Calculate it so a monk with level 60 fists and max haste should trigger it once every 30 to 60 seconds (give a thought on the trigger delay). The success of the bash should be based the on weapon skill used.<P>A least add a bash effect on the special attacks, success based on special attack skill level again.<P><BR>Evading abilities<P>With RoK the caps on Block, Dodge and Ripost have not been raised enough comapred to other melee so monks could stay ahead by the same pourcentage. This should be corrected and even over corrected as the gap between AC on monk gear and warrior gear has become vider with RoK and even more wide with Vellious.<BR>Raise the AC on monk only gear so it's will stop being ridiculous and raise stats buffs so our evade skills may work better.<P><BR>Armor<P>You must have noticed that most monks don't use a single piece of monk only armor whereas other classes are mostly equiped with class only armor. Don't you think there is something wrong here ??<P>Low Ac is the first reason, you should up the AC on these items closer to those worn now by monks. Just enough to make the armor a choice to consider.<P>Monk have so few items available to them that it's a pain to get resist gear. I don't think this was intentional so put more resist stats on monk only armor as it's about the only place they can get some. I think that is the best idea because it will give the players a very good reason to consider using these armors against higher AC all/all stuff.<BR>Example :<BR>Monks now use old azure sleeves (ac 12 no stats). Make the shiverback sleeves ac 8 and add some stats and resists and they will have a choice to consider here.<P>Still about resist, why the monk bonus to fire resist isn't as good as the warrior's bonus tu magic resist ? It seems to me it's the same type of bonus and should be the same value.<P>I have also noticed that monks have way less items available with spells on them, why is that ? I hope it was not intentional and that you will correct that soon. Being able to use a few spells is so funny  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> I would love to be able to use the ragefire bracer too, why can't I ? The armors from ragefire are too heavy to cannot be used in combat so make them monk usable so we can have fun too with the spells please. This game is about fun first, allow us to share some.<P>--------------------------------------------------<P>I'm done bothering you, thanks for reading.<P><BR>- Aaricia, 58 master and cutest monk of The Nameless  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Nowadays,Monks lost their positons in this game when they got 50+Lv,especially 55+Lv.<BR>So we want to find Monk's characteristic abilities again.<P>First,Monk's skills, abilities and AC/HP are not enough if you still think Monks are Parrying attacker.Monks should not be Evasive attacker by the reason feign skill does not work to evade theirselves from any mobs while a combat in a group.<BR>Unfortunally,their fists(include epic) are too great to avoid themselves from getting attentions of mobs.So monks have to control their auto-attack buttons while combat,with wasting their power of melee and healer's mana.They will not call Monk forever in their group in this game,after Monk shows his poor fighting stiles.<BR>So Monk is no longer reliable melee class in this game.<P>Feign Pulling was nerfed by the visions of Game Designers against pulling.So Monk lost the position as prime puller forever.<BR>That was good job,if you think WAR/PAL/SHD must be the best pullers in this game.They can be the best reliable pullers in their certain situations.<P>I have to say,Absor.Please show us your CERTAIN VISION what monk should be.Almost of your replies were without your visions what the Monk class is,except you told monk should be questhounds rather than gearhounds.<BR>We want to know what Monks should do in this game.<P>In addition,Monks do not need any more damaging powers without deffensive skills or abilities,by the simple reason it would kill theirselves faster.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here's my 2cp.<P>Keep in mind, this is coming from a level 12 Iksar Monk, but I read ALOT.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>A lot of these make sense in a Role-Playing perspective, and hopefully will mesh with "The Vision" &lt;genuflect&gt; of what a Monk should be.<P>We are supposed to be martial arts masters and the "masters of melee."  <P>1) Remove the special attack inter-locks.  i.e.: Why should I be unable to Eagle Strike / Round Kick / Kick in succession?  The total damage output is negligible at higher levels, and Instill Doubt already has the animation showing that it is physically possible.  Perhaps to balance this out, increase the reuse delay.  <P>2)  I disagree with adding Stun to monk special attacks.  This is infringing on true Tank territory, and I dislike the idea of sharing abilities with other classes.  Much as I'd like to shoot an Ice Commit from my arse, leave the DD to the Wizzies, etc.  Warriors / SKs ... they are brutes in comparison to the finesse of a well played monk.  Let them stun with their bashing.  However, I think adding the possibility of a Critical to the special attacks makes more sense.  We are the only Melee class without Crits. (Warriors have them, rogues have them on thrown weapons)<P>3)  Special Attacks should have the chance to disrupt spell casting.  If a bixie lands a lucky hit on my Necromancer, there is a chance of disrupting my spell.  I think a well placed flying kick should be able to do the same, yes?<P>4) Epic Fists:  The whole idea behind the epics is not everyone will have them.  Why is that even an issue with regard to class balancing?<P>5)  In regards to the Moss Covered Twig being the only off hand only weapon available to Monks, there is also the Essence of Dol.  Please keep the non Uber weapons in mind folks.  Some of us have yet to earn Surnames.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>6) From what I understand, Monks were originally supposed to be able to run faster due to our weight restriction.  I'm not asking for a built in SoW, but maybe the same as a low level bard?  When they first get Selo's Accelerando, they don't move a whole lot faster than a normal run, but it will still out run the average Joe.<P><BR>7)  Adding other skills are good ideas, but not if they're skills other classes have.  We need something new.  Having them attained through a quest is a great idea.<P><BR>8)  Someone mentions giving headbands/sashes stats similar to our Iksar Shackels.  If you do, please consider giving the shakels the Stat buffs that the Mammals get from their quest items.<P>This is the best I could come up with so far.  Hope you like the ideas, and keep up the good work!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ok, I'm way in the back and nothing but a junior monk with all the +50's commenting but Absor you asked for reasoning behind our requests.<P>With me at 38, Necro pets cast by chars up to 5 levels below me can outdamage me.  A 32 warrior with a fbss and a slow 2hb can outdamage me (these are not uncommon things I encounter).  I get no taunt and no stun.  No crazy attack (triple attack).<P>To make a group want me beyond using me as a FD pull machine, make it so nigh naked, using just my hands I do more damage a round than anyone else except some dumb caster nuking too early in the fight.<P>KEEP IT BALANCED, by having my STAMINA drop more quickly as I fight (so I become significant;y less effective over time) - so during long fights, where a bigger, better protected warrior or Rogue hidden in the shadows untouched will then start to outdamage me as I tire and take a beating (just like life).  <P>But in the first flurry of battle, or in moments of sheer paniced melee, no other fighting class should be able to do more damage in say a 5 round window than a Monk can do.<P>As we get higher, leave our offense as it is, or maybe add stun and triple so we keep up on the planes and against the uber mobs, but make our defense king.  Make the monk class wanted in groups not because we do more damage than warriors but becuase we are hard to kill off and at the end of the fight, with the group pounded to near death, we are still standing with our warrior brethren on the front line and can have the chance to deliver the ashen hand to finish it.  What better way to add value to the monk class than to make them a catylist for saving groups beaten down but still hanging in there?<P>Let warriors be the damage machine over time, make the Rogue the stealthy damage nuker, the cleric the blessed savior, casters crowd control and buff/healing kings.  Let SK's find a home as shades of warriors with a special evil casting touch.  But let monks have value in there ability to survive and fight on when the group is overwhelmed and just needs a second or two to rekindle the power of being a team.  No single monk will turn the tide, but they should be able to hold it for a second and let a good group of casters, warriors and priests a chance to do what they do best and bring the group back.<P>This probably mean monks will die a lot more, but hey I don't play this game to sit and watch on the sidelines safe from harm.  I play it to be in the center of the action and I'd like to know I contribute to my group beyond a safe MOB snare machine.<P>/bows deeply<P>Fangfoo 38 Monk, Tor. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>EPIC QUEST<BR>------------------------------<BR>"The epic quest is too easy."<BR>------------------------------<BR>No, it's not.  The components require quite a bit of time.  I've spent over 50+ hours in Karnors with no Pawbuster.  I've spent 30+ hours in Chardok with no Betrayer.  I spent exactly 91 hours camping Raster, 10 hours camping Targin, 5 hours camping for Zephyl, 20 hours camping Qwinn, and around 50 hours camping for headbands/sashes.  Add another 20 hours in Skyfire trying to get a book.  <P>Almost 300 hours already put into my epic quest, and I still have yet to get the Robe of Whistling Fists, Book of the Immortals, let alone start on the killing of Eejag, Gwan, Trunt, Deep, and Xenorvash.  You can bet that I'll be spending several hundred more hours doing this quest, and that's providing I don't fail any battles.  <P>Maybe it's just bad luck.  But you know what?  I've talked to or read horror stories of countless monks spending as much time as me and more.  Add in another huge significant time slot for the Iksars forced to do faction work to get their sashes/headbands.<P>Why should the monks who have been unable to get their epic quests be any different then those that already have theirs.  We should all have the same opportunity to get our epic quest with the same requirements.  <P>*************************************************<BR>Suggestions<BR>*************************************************<BR>There are some changes that should be done to the quest.  <P>1- Iksar must do a lot of faction work to get their headbands / sashes.  Instead of forcing them to become friendly to a race they would not normally be, let them have their own quests.  Perhaps they can turn in shackles or another similar quest line can be created.<P>2-  Headbands and Sashes should be no drop.  It's not right that they can be sold and bought.  This would also make the quest a bit "harder".  An increase in their stats, particulary AC should be implemented to make them useful items instead of a bank and quest item only.<P>3-  Robe of the Lost Circle.  This should be quest only.  A loophole of the epic is that an "uber" guild can take out quest NPC's such as Brother Zephyl to subtract all the time needed to camp sashes/headbands/Raster/Targin for the robe.  Make it so it dosen't drop anymore, and can only be done by quest.  <P>This is just the tip of the iceberg.  It makes me extremely frustrated seeing a post calling for the quest being made harder, and even more so considering that this was a topic put on the list of possible monk changes.  The only change needing to be done is to make it more Iksar friendly and add more No Drop elements to the quest items.  Why make the rest of the monk community wishing to do their epic quest suffer from a selfish post.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

You aren't familiar with these classes, so you need to take it in context with what's been done before, said before, and comparing them to other classes.<P>Trolls pay the same penalty as Iksars, but trolls have only ONE advantage over other races, the same regeneration Iksars get. There is no other advantage to playing a Troll warrior over a halfling for instance, at upper levels.<P>Secondly, Verant already acknowledged that the Iksar AC bonus was too much of an imbalance between the two races when it came to monks for the experience difference to cover, so they implemented faster fists for human monks over iksar monks.

</FONT><HR>I'm a lvl 53 Human Monk on Quellious.<P>In grouping with a number of warriors and rogues im amazed at our damage output in comparison to theirs. A rogue i was with the other day was repeatedly backstabbing for the mid 200's and got as high as 500+ with one of his backstabs. (Thats an insane amount of damage when added to his normal damage). &lt;-- I'm not calling for a NERF but something to make us monks more proud of who we are.<P>In terms of the TANK CLASSES Monks i believe have a 20% exp penalty where Rogues and Warriors have 0%. Effectively based on this penalty shouldn't the same level Monk be considerably BETTER than the Warrior or Rogue? This is not the case at 50+ and either the penalty needs to be removed or the classes damage and defence abilities lifted to reflect that penalty more accuratly.<P>SUGGESTION; Could you make the damage of our Flying kick more meaningful. In doing this i would like to see some questable armour become available for footware that would increase maybe our skill table? (+10, +20, +50) to our skills based on the type of shoes we are wearing. So at level 30 make a quest or drop available that would end up in a reward of a pair of boots that would be +10 to FK skill over what it currently is. And so on for the higher levels. If our cap at lvl 60 for flying kick is 230, these boots would result in 280 skill and therefore increase the damage output. If you disagree with the skills being raised then any other way that would increase the minimum and maximum damage dealt.<P>Also, when our flying kick deals more than 100 damage could it not be shown on screen to all regardless as to their chat filters? Similar to Critical hits for warriors. It would give us a sense of pride within the group we are with.<P>Planes armour has already been mentioned as not having the significant stats in relation to other available armour. But could you also look at the drop rates for Shiverback in PoF. I have been to PoF 5 times and each was a 3 day raid. In that time there were 3 Shiverback drops. That is downright horrible. 15 days and still im without one piece of Shiverback armour. The NO DROP on these items is plainly unfair based on the drop rates.<P>Supporting past posts;<BR>There is no reason to "NERF" our epic quest. If you do the quest as it is intended it is one of the longest quests in the game and can take place from level 1. I would be extremely critical if you listened to the voice of other monks that have already obtained their epic who are asking for a nerf to stop others getting theirs.<P>Creme Dalacreme<BR>lvl 53 Human Monk<BR>Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

We probably get far too wraped up in it and our expectations are high.

Perhaps you don't want us to get too excited I do not know.<P>I am sure every class is saying the same thing but if the brain trust at VI honestly believe the monk to be a viable member in the psot 50 group something is wrong. If some drastic changes are not forthcoming to balance the monk class next to the rogue and warrior than I will likely walk away from this game once and for all.<P>A 40-50% increase in damage output is totally reasonable and it only seems drastic becasue we have been screwed that badly since the release of RoK.<P>I'm rather upset atm because I see every other class getting positive changes this past year except the monk. <P>Do what you must Absor but I for one have little faith in the system any longer.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One direction that doesn't seem to be looked in is the classic type monk. Sweeps to stun, with a long delay before it works again. Perhaps a side step or throw? Feign death (I am prepared for the flame) is really not a monk's style. Also, SOME magic would be nice. Very few things, but a heal (Mr. Miagi, hehe) and a gate (passing through shadows back home). I also think that our punches and kicks shouldn't be linked, and there was a really good idea in "combos". All of these things I have named are a bit much, but would balance the higher levels. I think instead of higher damage, perhaps varied damage. Our thrown shurikens could become a real attack. Again, the sweeps and throws, and a variety of things. Variety is, after all, is the spice of life.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>An idea for a change that could possibly solve multiple issues here:<BR>Give monks specialisation! Yeas, thats right. Just like real world martial arts, there are those who train in weapons (kung fu and some types of karate for example) and those who train unarmed (kick box, sambo, muay-thai, brazilian jiu-jitsu+vale tudo, stuff you see in the UFC). This would certainly add flavour to the class too.Give them a choice between the following:<BR>*Unarmed specialisation:<BR>Pros: Increase cap in HtH, increased fist damage, increased offensive and defensive skills and abilites (not just caps, maybe increased effectiveness, especialy for special attacks, such as tripple attack, stuns, crits, chain moves), all those while under current weight limit. This will bring monks using fists closer to monks using weapons in damage. The defensive increase is to cover the left gaps in damage (if any).<BR>Cons: Reduced weapon caps, and even weight limit.<BR>*Armed specialisation: <BR>Pros: Increased weight allowance, increased weapon caps. <BR>Cons: Decreased HtH and specdial attacks.<BR>So, what do you think?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR><BR>I am mainly discussing issues related to the high-level uber game, as thats what Im familiar with.<P>There is a major problem with Feign Death, mainly it doesnt work.  Someone brought up the mob frenzy idea, which is NOT correct.  While soloing, I have frequently successfully feigned with well under a bubble left.  The problem is lag.  My guess would be that lag causes the client and server not the synch the feign, so that while the client thinks it did a good FD, the server still has the monk as a valid target, the monk gets hit and feign breaks.  If Im in a fight and there are 5 or so other people there, feign almost never works (meaning no failure message, not interrupted, but I still get attacked).  If I step back and turn my back to the fight, it works better.  But as a life saving tool in combat, its marginal as is.  As an agro reducer, its worthless.  Currently, Feign Death is only useful when pulling, soloing or scouting.<P>The biggest problem I see with Monks is that we dont have a role.  Were not tanks; we dont have the HP or AC of a Warrior, not to mention no taunt ability.  Monks may do slightly more damage than Warriors, but the difference is minor, and probably shrinking with new, better Warrior weapons out there and triple attacks.  Also, Monks usually have fast, agro producing attacks, and no evasion ability (as discussed earlier, FD is useless here) so Monks often must hold back to avoid becoming damage sponges.  The net effect is that Monks actually manage to do less damage than Warriors do.  Basically, one melee class, Warriors, are better at ALL aspects of combat than another, Monks.  That is not balance.  Monks do FAR less damage than Rogues, whose Evasion allows them to attack at will.  <P>So what can Monks do?  Some scouting, sneak improvements have made Rogues generally better for that.  Corpse recovery is now located in Necroland.  It comes down to pulling, which is not in the Vision, and Velious was designed to make feign pulling as hard as possible.  Its been said that feign pulling makes no sense from a role playing perspective, I disagree.  Perhaps in a literal sense, it is silly.  Just like a Dark Elf Rogue sneaking right into the front gates of Freeport in broad daylight past KOS guards.  Personally, I imagine the Rogue got into Freeport by climbing the wall, or using a disguise, but the game engine cant support it.  Feign pulling is in a similar vein, playing dead to draw out the curious.  Its a time-honored trick. I just imagine all the standing and flopping isnt taking place.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>The Iksar factor: There is no single disparity between two races in the same class as between Iksar and Human monks.  Iksar monks get infravision, regeneration (and extra 12 hp/tick at level 60, I believe) and an armor class bonus that maxes out at 50 AC.  Their disadvantages are minimal.  Faction is a pain in Antonica, but not an issue in Velious and advantageous in Kunark, as Cabilis is a much better place than FV.  Fist delay isnt an issue, because at level 60, monks either use Celestial Fists (same delay for Humans and Iksar) or weapons.  Lastly, there is an experience penalty (although with the elimination of classed based penalties, current Iksar Monks will actually take less exp to get to 60 than I did).  What makes all this worse is that most Human Monks never had the option to chose an Iksar.  It would have been an interesting idea to give Iksar Monks different skills than Human Monks, but its too late for that.  As it is, the Iksar are considerably more survivable.  <P>One final thing to remember when balancing classes: new equipment disturbs the balance.  A Warriors PoH leggings are AC 20, their PoG are 34.  A Monks PoF leggings are AC 5, their PoG leggings are 6.  That means that in Velious, the armor class gap increased even more.  Every time Warriors get new armor, their AC increases by leaps and bounds, while Monks get trivial increases.  So even if the classes are balanced today, that balance will be thrown out of whack tomorrow when Warriors get some AC 50 leggings and Monks get AC 8.<P>What is the solution?  Id like to see Feign Death fixed so it works in combat.  If there could be some sort of mem blur effect to wipe agro in combat (without making it abusive for pulling), that would be helpful.  Perhaps if a Monk is feigned and a mobs agro list is changed, the Monk is dropped from it?  Would that be possible?  So if I feign, and a Warrior taunts, the mob will forget me.<P>Monks need a place in the melee hierarchy.  Just doing more damage probably isnt the right solution.  What would be nice is if Monks were specialized in combat, better at fighting certain mobs.  It makes perfect sense that a Warrior in plate armor could fight hordes of Frogloks better.  However, someone more agile, not burdened by armor would be better able to dodge a dragons bite, and the protection of plate armor would do little to mitigate the damage from the six-inch fangs and jaws powerful enough to crush a VW.<P>The idea of a Monks special attacks having other effects is interesting.  Even if Monks just got stun, it would be an improvement, and make sense role playing wise.  Martial arts teach pressure points, something a knight in plate mail kicking never learned.  It would make the most sense to have Dragon Strike or Eagle Claw stun, as a) its more along the lines of a strike to pressure points and b) a Monk would have to trade off damage from Flying Kick.  Also, if an advantage was given to Humans, it could be that only Dragon Strike, not Iksar Tail Rake, stunned.<P>Finally, I hope feign pulling is brought back.  My EQ identity is as a puller.  Thats what I enjoy, and I spent a lot of time perfecting my skills.  Its something unique to my class.  Maybe a Warrior is a tougher fighter, and a Rogue can drop mobs faster, but pulling is at least a purpose.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

He also gains the ability to control his aggro to avoid tanking and to maximize his damage. The rouge is a VERY mana efficient DoT that can go invisible at will and has the ability to open locked doors, sense and disarm traps.<P>The warrior gets to deliver as much damage as we do(almost) and gets to tank MUCH better than we do.<P>Might i add that both those two classes got a experience bonus in your new system and i have faced having a experience penalty my entire career.<P>Its not entirely amusing to have your character mutilated by the liveteam at 50 just cause you desided to release RoK and then SoV.<P>We were a damage specialist that sacrificed hps for damage output and you left us with the sacrifice and took away our reward.<P>The epic needs to be reworked:<BR>*good ratio instead of good delay(18/25 or so) this will ensure us to hit harder but less often and not attract so much aggro. We realy should get a better ratio weapon than rogues since their damage is supposed to be in backstabbing and ours from normal attacks. This would also make it so that we wont use a stave of shielding over our fists for offhand(a stave dropped at zone line better than our epic?).<BR>*make the effects from the song into item based effects like the ragebringer so we can be buffed like anyone else.<BR>*I highly suggest to have iksars suffer a 1 pt higher delay on epic as they do on normal fists too to make that disadvantage somthing more than just for show.<BR>*Dont consider the epic easy to get just cause the actual quest isnt horribly difficult. You have to consider all the time put in by monks completing sash, headband and the two robe quests when considering its difficulty. <P>Other than the epic changed we realy need somthing innate to our class to make us better damage dealers post 50. Many great suggestions in this thread of ways to help this situation.<P>We also need to be able to drop on aggro list without loosing damage like rogues can if we ever are going to be a mana effecient damage dealer.<BR>Also many great suggestions for this here.<P>When you look at shiver ac then look at PoG and SoV quest armor ac and graphics too, please.<P>Aelorn 56 monk Saryrn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

That way the monks role would be defined again.  That way, they have a specific thing they do, with the higher defence they are not the cleric mana drain they are now, and they don't step on the toes of the other classes.  I know that would take a mindset change on the game designers, but it seems to me that they painted the monk into a corner when they helped the other classes, they raised the bar for all except monks.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Not sure you are still reading these posts, but only thing I want for my monk is to be able to click off spells other people cast on me, mostly enchanter/shaman haste spell, can't do anything about bard , since it a song. I have epic, and it doesn't stack with anything, So I lose the haste, extra atk/ac bonus's with it.<BR>(personally I'd like to click off any PC spell casted on me)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Though I have no doubt my view will be frowned upon, I feel compelled to mention it anyway.<P>I read somewhere in this thread about a monk wanting Feign Death to be more effective, specifically more effective against the 'frenzy code' that a mob seems to use when a monk is below a certain amount of HP.<P>Now, I happen to play a cleric.  We have a spell called Divine Aura, which has 'the gods render me invulnerable' for 18 seconds.  However, I can and do get stunned during those 18 seconds.  This, as you can imagine, severely reduces the odds that I may flee a bad encounter through becoming invulnerable.  So I am invulnerable, but I still get stunned.  Why?  Because whoever was handling The Vision way back when said 'Nobody gets a "get out of jail free card".'  <P>So, my stance is probably clear by now.  If the gods render me invulnerable and I still need some vaseline for what then happens to me, monks (and everyone else) should be in the same boat.  That's purely my opinion.  <P>Slang Logic:<BR>The dieties themselves render me invulnerable, and I still get dazed and spun like a rag doll.<BR>You FD at low health, spewing blood and in the thralls of trauma induced grand mal seizures, and expect a mob to write you off entirely?<BR>Counter Slang Logic:<BR>You've croaked more times than anyone can possibly count, so you darn well ought to be good at faking a death. How hard can a pretend dirt-nap be?<BR>The gods who render me invulnerable will someday be found standing in their own plane, getting their hinies handed to them by 20 to 40 teenagers that haven't slept in 18 hours. Their ability to protect anything will be highly suspect at that point.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Dear Absor,<P>I mainly want to express my full support of the idea compilation posted by Valares / Bodi / Zadkiel. This post is the joint work of a LOT of people in the monk community and should be imho (after all i have only 130 days played on Rogan) the main focus of your attention.<P>(Sorry if this sounds condescending, but even though you stated previously that "you know a good idea when you see one", your claimed interest in monk throwing critical hits has made me a tad doubtful)<P>Otherwise, as i tend to do more and more BGH these days, the concerns expressed by monks such as Denzalo and Arlos are also really dear to me (although those 2 took part in the brainstorming that led to Bodi / Zad 's post)<P>On a final note, i really think monk progression should be more skill-driven, and hence would really love to see quested skills.<P>Rogan - Master of the Silent Fist<BR>Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>FD fix:<BR>Personaly I doubt that there is any monk-low-on-HP check in the equation of the mobs chance to see through FD. It seems to have more to do with how much a mob hates the monk.<BR>The reason it becomes apparent in the combination with low health is of course that no one needs FD as an escape skill when being at full health.<P>Recently I was spending alot of time in OOT killing seafuries. I did that together with an enchanter and his pet. Sometimes I wanted to FD so the chanter takes a hit and his pet helps in combat but I had to realize that the "fail without fallen to the ground message" rate is 100% or nearby. And its reproducable. Do like 200 dmg solo to a seafurie and try to FD - never works for me. Auto attack was always off before i tried to FD and I tried multiple times, it would never work. <BR>What did work was: run away from the seafury. It will chase you but with sow or jboots it can be outrun. When there is a large enough distance hit FD and it will succeed and the fury runs back to who ever is left on the hate list (chanter in this case). So its either the melee or aggro range i have to get out of before I can successfuly FD those furies. With level 51+ mobs summoning the monk its obviously even harder to get out of melee (or aggro ?) range before trying to FD. And in dungeons with often limited space to fight in, low HPs and no sow / jboots how would someone outrun a mob to get away before trying to FD. So as an escape skill when the monk is low on health FD seems indeed pretty useless to me as well.<P>Spells not breaking FD: well, let's not trivialize the use of FD but the above situation needs fixing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 8 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053085-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053085.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053085-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053085-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053085-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053085-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053085-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053085-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053085&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053085&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
