</FONT><HR>-Idea for how to improve Taunt-<P>...quickly and easily.<P>Currently, when taunt succeeds, it puts you just above the former #1 guy on the hate list.  How much higher isn't known but I suspect it's just +1.  When it fails, your position on the hate list remains unchanged.  The problem with being placed +1 above the former #1 spot is that if someone is even slightly outdamaging you AND is attacking just as quickly, they immediately re-take the #1 spot and there's nothing you can do about it till Taunt recycles.  <P>To improve it quickly and with a minimum of effort, do this:<P>1) Make a successful taunt put you 2 hate points per point of Taunt skill above the former #1 spot.  This means, when you max Taunt at 200, a successful taunt places you 400 points above the other guy.  Kendrick (a Verant guy) said melee hits can range from 50-500 points of hate, and Jolt is -500 hate points, so 400 seems an appropriate amount.<P>2) On an unsuccessful taunt, add 1 hate point per point of Taunt skill to your current total, but not to exceed the #1 spot's amount, if you aren't that person.<P>These two changes would have the following effects:<P>-All classes with Taunt would improve, but warriors would improve the most due to our higher Taunt caps.<P>-Untauntable ubermobs would still be untauntable, as intended.<P>-Even if someone is outdamaging you AND attacking as quickly (i.e. pretty much any monk, ranger, or rogue) a successful taunt can keep you above them for at least a little while.  It's still not a free aggro control button.<P>-A failed taunt is no longer completely useless, and, by itself, cannot place you on top of the hate list.<P>Aside from purely untauntable mobs (either because they are ubermobs or because they are higher level than you, post 50), the worst taunting situation to get into is someone who is attacking just as quickly AND is outdamaging you.  Rogues (when they fail to Evade successfully), nearly all post-50 monks, and (if the test changes happen) rangers all cause this situation.<P>You gave rogues the ability to Evade, which is good, but I'm very concerned that the upcoming changes will cause problems with aggro-management.  Rangers can Jolt, but only at 55 and it has resist problems.  Some possible changes on test may address this.  Monks can FD but in my experience, any monk who needs to FD to "let" me tank will regain aggro almost instantly.  Besides, is FD during combat to reduce aggro really its intended use?  Seems pretty silly to me.<P>To use myself as an example, I'm wielding a 9/19 weapon and an 11/22 weapon and I wear a runebranded girdle for haste.  Just how much better do I need to go to maintain aggro, and why am I forced into using the fastest weapons I can obtain in order to just plain get hit during combat?  Why even make twohanded warrior weapons when they reduce us to a non-tanking DoT?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think everything has been said that possibly could be said and Absor got the great majority of it down.<P>The only thing really that hasn't had alot of attention has been STATS.  There is no proven or noticable difference if you increase any of your stats, mainly STR and DEX.<P>I have a STR of 132 unbuffed and around 155 or so buffed.  This is quite a significant boost yet when I fight before and after buffs, I see little if any change in dmg as a result.<P>True AGI increases AC but it takes roughly 5-7 points to make 1 AC.  Nothin too much to brag about since AGI hasn't necessarily improved my ability to miss hits like it's definition states.<P>DEX has no impact whatsoever on what a tank or other melee class does.  I have seen for myself as well as other melee types to where a proc on a weapon has gone off more with a lower DEX.  Yes proc are random, however, what controls that randomization if DEX is not in the equation?  If it is, it's not working.<P>Basically, I comes down to that somehow certain stats don't do what they are "defined" to do.<P>Lastly, I agree that more emphasis should be made on the value of AC and gettin rid of the soft cap and tanks gettin the wealth of it as they should versus gettin more hp.  I like my clerics or any healer to be ready to fight alot more than medding cuz of how much he/she had to heal.<P>Thank you</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Also,<P>ENOUGH with the disciplines! Defensive is THE discipline used by high-level warriors. Making berserker frenzy a discipline on the same timer as Defensive would essentially be a NERF to berserker frenzy, relegating it to the land of never-to-be-used.<P>Implementing AOE Taunt is a grand idea, but making it a discipline, again, means it would compete with Defensive -- and hence remain unused.<P><BR>I've been reading the Paladin talks, and I noticed that an item for consideration is giving Paladins the Defensive discipline. My question to you is: are you insane, or just plain stupid? Warriors are supposedly the defensive class. WHY give our bread and butter to a class that will soon have our same defense caps, hps and ac within 3% of our own, lots of useful spells, self-healing, resurrection, etc? Balance, anyone?<P>As it now stands, there are several KEY issues that need to be addressed; namely:<P>1) Remove the AC soft cap at 1100. PLEASE.<P>2) Raise warrior hitpoints to compensate for the fact that we're soon going to be saddled with sharing our defensive top spot with paladins and shadowknights (classes which have higher net hps than us to begin with, since they can self-heal).<P>3) Fix taunt. Make it work a LOT more effectively.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I must agree in regards to the plea of my fellow Warriors to NOT touch Berzerker Fury.<P>Feel free to UPGRADE the effectiveness of Berzerker Fury...but do NOT make it a Discipline. For most young Warriors, this innate and natural ability is next to worthless. And thus it is not surprising that some of the pup fighters would ask for it to be changed to a Discipline or similiar wild idea.<P>They have probably not yet ventured into a dungeon environment where the casters have all gated out, the monk is feigned, perhaps others are hidden or invis...and the ONLY thing you can count on to save your life is the fact that you WON'T be overtaken by the slow "death-crawl" that occurs to other classes when their health is low.<P>The youngin's have not yet considered that someday in the far future being below two bubbles means you still have 1,000+ HP left to go.<P>And, of course, they have yet to understand how Berzerker Fury and certain Disciplines were meant to work TOGETHER, not as separate abilities.<P>So there you go. Feel free to upgrade it, but don't change the way it actually works.<P>However, as I said before...this issue and others should be considered secondary in nature.

</FONT><HR> Good list, Absor, thanks for doing this.    <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  <P>I do have a few comments on some of them, though.  <P> AoE TAUNT:  I like this idea.  This sounds like a fun new ability that, as Absor said, has its own drawbacks built right in.  <P>INCREASED HP:<BR>While I don't believe that the defensive gap between hybrids and warriors should be closed, I don't believe it should be widened either.  <P>TWO HANDED WEAPONS AND TAUNT:  This one could very well end up being a nerf in disguise.  Currently, warriors have the worst taunting ability of the 3 heavy tank classes, because taunt+spell+melle (hybrid) is a MUCH better taunt than  taunt+melee (warrior).  This is already a serious class balance problem post 50 (IMHO).  The only reason this problem is not worse than it already is, is because dual wielding taunts better than wielding a 2-hander.   If you change it so that 2-handers taunt as well as dual wielding, then warriors will fall even farther behind hybrids at taunting.   Be careful what you ask for, my warrior brothers.  You might get it.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  PLEASE DO NOT implement this one.    <P>FURIOUS DISCIPLINE:<BR> This discipline is not very useful anyway, so I never noticed this.  <P>COBALT HELM AND BRACER:  <BR> Drop rate on the bracer is just SLIGHTLY too low IMHO, but the drop rate on the helm is obscenely low.  The problem here is that the areas where these items drop is not an area that people really do as a one-group camp.  These areas are usually done as part of a multi-group raid, often just in passing on the way to Trakanon.  Hence, the number of reet frogs killed in a raid is usually very low.   I'm glad to see this one on the list. <P>CRITICAL HITS FOR LOW DAMAGE:<BR>  I really don't see a need to change this one.  Critical hits are basically eye-candy only (although I like them for that reason).  It never bothered me personally to see critical hits for 30 damage.    <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  That just meant to me that I got an extra 15 damage that time.  <P>BETTER TAUNT:  <BR> This is the big one to me.  If you guys at Verant don't implement anything else on this list, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE implement this one.  Taunting is 50% of the job of tanking, so it really isn't a good thing for warriors to be vastly inferior to paladins and shadowknights at taunting.  Slightly better ability at taking damage + dramatically INFERIOR ability at taunting = inferior tank.  Despite higher taunt skill caps, warriors are inferior taunters because some of the hybrid spells generate a *LOT* of hate, and they generate this high amount of hate EVERY time they are cast, even if the spell is resisted.  Procing weapons do not help the warrior very much with this, because the proc is random, and will rarely happen just at the moment needed to save a dying party member.  <P> Level 50+ mobs are much harder to taunt with the taunt button, and this DRASTICALLY increases the importance of taunting with spells, which warriors can't do.  <P> I suggest replacing the level 53 warrior discipline (charge) with a new discipline that would have a 15 or 30 minute re-use time, and would taunt just like a spell does: by simply generating a large amount of hate that would cause the mob to turn on the warrior 90% of the time, and stay on the warrior for a while after that (i.e. don't just hit the warrior once or twice and then go right back to killing the monk).  <P>BERZERKER FRENZY AS A SKILL: <BR>  This could be good, or it could end up being a nerf.  If you replace any of the disciplines with this new skill, then it WILL BE A NERF.  The level 54 warrior discipline turns every hit into a critical hit or crippling blow for a few seconds.  This does not add all that much to the warrior damage output, unless the warrior uses it when he is berzerk.  If you replace a discipline with "berzerking", then berzerk will no longer stack with the 54 discipline, which will make the level 54 discipline nearly useless.  (Useless is a strong word, I know, but the amount of damage it adds would almost never be worth the very long re-use time of this discipline, unless it can be used to turn every hit into a crippling blow.  I rarely use this discipline even now.  If I can't use it to turn every hit into a crippling blow, then I would *NEVER* use it.) <BR> <BR>Again, warriors, be careful what you ask for.  You might get it.  <P>RESPECT FROM GREENIES:  <BR> I wouldn't really oppose changes here, but this isn't really that important to me.  Being the only class with no way to protect myself from hoards of greenies is a price that I have consciously paid for the advantages of the warrior class.  It's a big price, but it's one that I knowingly paid when I created my character.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>IMHO<BR>====<P>ITEM: Better Taunt.<BR>DESCRIPTION: Warriors want to be able to taunt more effectively at the higher levels. It may be, though, that the problem isn't with their ability to taunt, but with the taunting of other classes. Also, players are not supposed to be able to dictate the actions of higher level monsters. They are supposed to be smart enough to kill who they think needs killing, and they are not supposed to be tricked by simple name calling… But this should be looked at along with the big picture, perhaps warriors should have a greater ability to taunt.<P>If the Vision[tm] defines Warriors as 'meat shields' and high level mobs are smart enough to attack other players because of this, then something is REALLY wrong.  'Hi, I'm a meat shield, that's what I'm designed for, but mobs won't attack me so I mill around pointlessly.'<P>ITEM: AoE Taunt.<BR>DESCRIPTION: The ability to 'taunt' all of the creatures in your combat range. This would have to be a high level ability, most likely a discipline.<P>This is, IMO, a stupid idea.  Based on the Vision[tm] of taunting and mob-intelligence, AoE taunt makes zero sense.  Plus, unless taunt OVERALL gets fixed, who cares.  It won't affect anything at all.<P>ITEM: Two-Handed weapons and taunt.<BR>DESCRIPTION: The consensus is that slower weapons taunt less, no matter the damage level generated. If this is the case, perhaps finding some way to make these weapons taunt more would make them more popular.<P>Fixing OVERALL warrior taunt will fix this.<P>ITEM: Increased Hit Points:<BR>DESCRIPTION: Some warriors feel that their hit points are too low, at least at the high levels.<P>Not a bad idea, if not taken to extremes.<P>ITEM: Berserker Frenzy as a skill.<BR>DESCRIPTION: This has the potential to be significantly overpowering, but it's certainly interesting. The idea is to turn berserking into a skill or discipline with a recycle time and a duration that balances out the fact that they can do this at will. This might also mean the removal of the berserk code for low health. Perhaps the berserk skill would drain stamina and then, when stamina was gone, hit points.<P>Bad, bad idea.  It's not broken, it's effective and interesting as is.  Please don't change it.<P>ITEM: Respect.<BR>DESCRIPTION: The idea here would be that a deadly warrior shouldn't be jumped on by little green beetles when wandering back to his corpse. They should fear his dangerous fighting power. The gameplay point here is that warriors have no way of travelling safely among otherwise annoying greens. Where a caster would go invisible, a warrior has to fight off hordes of weak enemies.<P>Amen.  Make green cons indifferent until player-aggro'ed, at which point they can all gang on the foolish warrior.<P>ITEM: Equiping shields on the back.<BR>DESCRIPTION: Allowing shields to be used in back slots. A popular idea, and it makes some sense, assuming the shield only gave an armor class bonus from the back.<P>A very interesting idea, but one that's probably impossible to justify as a class-specific idea, which sucks since sooo many shields will be overbalanced on the backs of many rangers/rogues/paladins/SK's.<P>SUMMARY:<P>- Fix taunt<BR>- Add 'Respect'<BR>- Add a few HP's<BR>- Shields on back (if workable)<P>*** A final note:  My biggest beef with the hybrid/warrior issue is this.  Both expansion and many patches have introduced many new spells and disciplines for the hybrids, while the warriors got (comparably) little.  Is it really unreasonable to throw in _something_ for the Warrior class?  I think I speak for all warriors when I say 'Oh Gee, look new ranger/paladin/SK spells.'<P>Thanks for reading this  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>All Melee's (all classes) need the ability to be bound in any place.  Lets face it, the whole idea of dying and coming back to life at a predestined goes against anything explainable or reasonable from an "Everquest Lore" standpoint.  The only reason life after death and bind points are in the game is for function and practicality and it doesn't add to the roleplaying aspect.  Therefore everyone is hurt from the inability of melee classes not being able to bind in any place but inside a city.  It just makes it near impossible to find balanced pick up groups (some of us never will be in anything more than pick up groups) in some areas because melees wont travel there due to the lack of a nearby or friendly bind point.<P>Giving all classes the ability to be bound outside of cities will just increase the overall fun of the game and remove some of the barriers of travel.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I just wanted to say that the concept of weapon specialization is really silly, and I hope they don't implement it.<P>It would be a good idea if there were any real difference between the weapons.  If, for example, blunt weapons did damage and could stun, while piercing weapons did reduced damage but effectively lowered the target's AC, and slashing weapons were just normal.  Then you would have some basis to pick a specialization from.<P>But right now, the weapon we pick is the weapon that does the most damage that we can afford to obtain.  There's no sense in specializing in 1HB just because you happen to like the Club of the Ice Ocean, when next week you'll stumble over a better 1HS and your specialization will be worthless.<P>Weapon specialization would be something to consider for EQ2, and make each weapon type of a unique characteristic.  There's no point in implementing it in EQ as-is.<P>Also, just to chime in, I agree that making berserker frenzy as a discipline would be a nerf.  Since I use Defensive as my disicpline, I would basically never be able to Frenzy anymore, which would make Mighty Strike completely worthless.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Berserker Frenzy idea.<P>Bad idea.<P>I prefer that it is left alone as it is. I'm perfectly fine the way it works.<P>But, my suggestion for the use of Berserker would be for an increase in berserker mode.

The point spells like this SHOULD NOT be allowed to hit players on PVP period, since it is highly unbalanced, and young melee classes have no way to defend themselves until much later in the game.

Please consider this skill for lower levels where it would be most useful.<P>Personally, I think AE taunt would make a LOT of warriors (and their caster buddies) happy without throwing a big wrench into game mechanics.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Jarery's list is very good and I agree with all points.  Being a level 60 warrior, those items would help a ton without warriors becoming "too uber".<P>Im not gonna add anything to the list except for a Epic quest rant.<P>/rant on<P>I've been working on my epic now for a couple months.  As a warrior you really cant WORK on it, since all the major pieces require 24+ people.<P>Since I have to drag 24+ people everywhere to get a single piece, why do these pieces have to be uncommon to just plain RARE?<P>Lets start with Chardok royalty.  The Queen is considered to be the toughest of the royalty, but only has a drop rate of around 15% for the warrior quest item.  Why dont clerics and enchanters have to deal with these low drop rates on the King and Prince?  What does it prove to require 24+ friends to kill the queen an avg of 7 times for me to get a single quest piece?<P>Spiroc lord.  Same thing here.  The spiroc lord has about a 10%-15% drop rate on the blade.  Take 24+ friends on a 4+ hour run, only to come up empty.  If it wasnt for the epic piece, Sky would be another dead zone.<P>Theres nothing Epic about the warrior quest except the epic amounts of time you need to kill the same mobs over and over and over.  Other class quest at least have some RP elements to them.  Clerics and Rogues get the cool triggered spawns, and enchanters get to use their charm skills.  The warrior quest is an excersize in TOIL.  Unfortunately its not only my toil, its the poor 24+ people I gotta drag all over the place that toil too.<P>Even some of the easier items are a pain to get.  Gotta get that hand off maestro that does'nt drop all the time.  Nothing a level 60 warrior in full cobalt likes better than to head to hate for a shot at another rare drop.  Ball of ever-luvin golem, same deal.  Last time I did Fear was to help an enchanter get a quest item and none of the golems coughed up the goods. <P>Why is there such a disparity in the dificulty of these EPIC quest?  Almost every rogue I see has an Easybringer, and I've seen low 50's rangers able to forage up their Epics.  One of my best friends got his cleric Epic and I hardly knew he was working on it.  Rogues and Rangers get the added bonus of a Sky class haste item along with their weapons.<P>When it comes right down to it, its pretty difficult for me to justify wasting 24+ peoples time to kill the same mobs over and over so that I can get a substandard weapon.  Of course if I should ever finish it, I'll be able to go 3rd person view up against the zone wall and say "Yep, looks cool".</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ITEM: Critical hits for low damage.<P>DESCRIPTION: When a warrior gets a critical hit, having it hit for less than a normal hit can be distressing. Perhaps putting a minimum damage on a crit (or raise it if there is one now) to be close to their normal maximum damage would be a good idea. So, if the damage generated is less than their normal maximum, raise it to that maximum.<P>What I belive most are complaining are about, is that critacle hits now do below or max damage of a normal swing.  If anything I wanna see the crits damage up more, more than max. A critical hit should not be a normal max damage hit.  If it is, it just means it has a special name.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The thing about taunt is it is just not effective against high level creatures. Caster do not even need to generate agro in any way and you still cant get the mob off. A perfect example is the Plane of Growth you have mobs like the sprites, Protectors of Growth, ect that automaticaly agro on casters no matter what. the mobs can be pull to camp and instead of agroing on the warrior who is stabbig them and taunting the run for every caster who is sitting down, and the likely out come is a few dead casters before you can taunt them off. Coding seems to be writen to agro on catter type classes first no matter what.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>just to throw in my 2 cents worth here.<P>AoE taunt - interesting idea, could be useful. however, this wouldn't solve the problem that currently exists with taunt.<P>berzerking as a skill - has some interesting points, as a skill. as a discipline, it becomes just another useless peice of crap to not even bother to hotkey. because of the way warrior's disciplines are set up, there is basically one truly useful discipline: defensive.<P>on hybrids - by effectivly increasing both the spell casting range, ac, damage output, and hps of the hybrid classes, it is in effect a nerf. ever heard the term war of attrition? in everquest, warriors are currently on the losing side of one. without a way to maintain a warrior's edge (forgive my pun), there will be NO use for warriors. this is already becoming the case. pallys or shadowknights are just as commonly used in pickup groups and camps, (i'm not saying this is wrong), but i dislike seeing a shadowknight gain preferance over a warrior - it really demeans the value of my class. the reason? fully buffed, the pally has about 200 less hit points than me, and since he has lay on hands, that effectivly gives him DOUBLE my hit points. the shadowknight can ubertaunt a mob with his harmtouch, pulling off the casters for those vital heals. just to make a case in point, (keeping names anon, out of respect), a lvl 60 shadowknight, when equiped with just about the best gear possible, has approximatly 200 less hps than a lvl 60 warrior in full bezerker. think about this - they have the same ac, because of the softcap, virtually the same hit points, and, since both have their epic, nearly the same damage output. counting harm touch - the shadowknight wins. <P>equipment - warriors are all about it. the more toys and pretty shinies, the better. so why are the best peices of warrior gear attainable by other classes? a solution posted on the 6th extention of the thread had a nice idea - make all the good warrior stuff nodrop. this has two nice benefits. 1) no farming, and only the people who can use it get it. 2) i don't have to look at damn lvl 20 (or below) twinks with better armor and weaopnry than i have. <P>backs and sheilds - interesting coding problem is presented - especially if any other classes than warrior can use the sheild. therfor, would just suggest changing the drop of the nautilus sheild in the plane of fear to a nautiuls shell cloak (or similarly named item). same stats - would be an uncommon drop in the planes, much like rogue shrieking aelphiss (usful in range slot.) this would be a very easy thing to do - no graphic change needed, and basicaly a minor tweek.<P>epic weapon concerns are very very important. see my referance to equipment.<P>hilwin brought up an interesting point - what does agility do for a warrior? it is considered one of the warrior's primary stats, but above 75 points, the benefit is minimal.<P>armor class - we need a better understanding of how armor class works in this game. yes, we know it's important, but without a frame of referance, all the data we gather is pointless.<P>respect - pointless. i like having to outrun green cons to get to my corpse. it's part of the fun. do i get annoyed that a lvl 5 skeleton will go out of it's way to (try) and hit me? yes. but one riposte kills it, so i'm cool with that.<P>================<BR>unadressed issues<BR>================<P>ok, the cons in velius - either increase the mob level so that it is commensurate with the damage output or decrease the damage output. i find it scarey that a shadow guardian in iceclad ocean, which is under level 35, could take my lvl 50 warrior down more than 2/5 of my hps. there is definetly something wrong with this picture.<P>soloability - soloabilty shouldnt' be a warrior issue, because of the sheer downtime involved. however, anything that increases our soloability would be a plus. this includes innate haste, regen, and higher bandaid caps.<P>well, taht's my two coppers. flame on.<P>-siacay, 51 warrioress, Cazic-Thule...(playing my rogue since i can't get a group...)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I would just like to add something to this list.  I am a warrior, and I understand that our place is not out soloing.  However, every other class in the game can solo exceptionally better then a warrior.  The idea is to make a warrior the one class absolutely required in a group.  Well, we're not.  Pally's have our defense.  Rangers have our offense.  Everyone else out-damages us.  Our taunt rapidly loses effectiveness post-50, and we are the only class who cannot perform CR in any situation.  So what I recommend is this.  If it is a warrior's place to be in a group at all times, then the dev team of EQ better make darn sure nobody, and I repeat nobody, takes our place as meat shield and taunter.  Right now, its getting that way, and its getting that way fast.  So either give us back our edge, and fast, or make us a soloable class, and fast.  Because right now, we can't do either significantly better then another class, and it sucks.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>thank you Jaade, glad someone saw that idea  and liked it =)<P>and the guy before you makes some very good points.  <P>I think what Absor is afraid of the most is if we become too good no one will want to be paly's or SK's or rangers. Don't count on it.  Give them better defense, fine. Just allow our AC to matter, and fix whatever is not working in regards to AGI.  I don't care if I have only 200hp's more, but I better have 150 to 200 aC more at 60, and it better matter. that's the issue it sounds like.<P>Someone else made a point about my specialization idea.  knocked it because of the issue of what about when I get a better weapon?  ok, I'll answer that. <P>We all know what basically the best weapons are of each type. This doesn't mean every warrior should have to be the best at 1hs. Someone MIGHT wish to be a 2hb person,  or a 1hb warrior, it's possible they just want to be different. Just like how Ogre warriors keep saying they want to use 2hs effectively. (and i'm sure barbs and trolls too).  But just like a caster's specialization, every skill should get an improvement to 50, just like every class of magic does. <P>if you use the scale I discussed, then every non main skill gets an innate 10% haste max. But the 2 you take beyond 50 can grow to 20% 1h or 30% 2h.  seems like a nice trade off. So lets say you like to DW, and get a super 1hs and a super 1hb or piercer. One gets a 20% haste at 60, the other 10%. Still not bad.  And maybe they allow 2h to go to 75, so it's half of the other 2h skill. <P>Also, as I mentioned, let the other melee classes have this skill to a lesser degree. It would become the melee version of caster specialization, which should have been the first thought after the caster one by whomever thought it up.  <P>and for those that think berserker frenzy works fine, you're crazy. the issue about the lvl 54 disc. and berserker frenzy makes sense, so that's it's only practical use.   the way it is currently implemented is pathetic. For you to sit here and say oh it's fine leave it be, you need to lay off the weed.  Hybrids get spells, rogue's Backstab, Monks kicks, bards songs, that all boost their dmg output for a single hit.  these hits are for normally substantially more than a normal swing would be.  We get an autoskill that we have no control over, and when it does work, it does random damage. Backstab hits for well over a normal hit, monk special attacks the same. ours routinely hit for under half of a normal hit's dmg.  If left as is, it should at least hit for 2x max dmg, and crippling blows should hit for at least 3x max and should happen at least twice as often.  I also think while our STR goes up and ATK, our defense should drop. I would think that once I start wielding like a madman, I'm gonna hit a lot harder, but I'm not going to be dodging very much.<P><BR>oh, and on the issue of soloing. i don't think any of us started warriors to solo. Besides, you ever grouped with a good warrior absor? why would we solo? in a good group all we do is pull, kill, pull, kill. Non stop. i could never attain solo the exp i get in a group. I can' do all the little tricks a druid can. But I learn how to pull great and can be steadily bringing more as the others med.  I would never solo, even if you gave us sow speed innately.  would not happen. No reason to.  <P>I do think we should get a meditate regen equivalent though. with almost 3000hps to regain, it would be helpful. does any caster get 3000 mana pts? how long would it take if they did?  even that slow would be better than now.  it's not going to help us solo, but it may keep us alive after getting jumped on corpse recovery or just traveling.<P>looking forward to seeing your responses absor, take your time and get them right.
