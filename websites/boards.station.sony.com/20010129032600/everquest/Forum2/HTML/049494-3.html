</FONT><HR>This is a discussion about druids, and what they need to have to make them more balanced. Obviously every class has its issues, but keep in mind, classes were made to compliment each other, and not every class can do everything.<P>However, some things need to be adressed. <P>Shamans nearly always replace a druids spot for a group, with all their group friendly spells - Mob debuffs, haste, massive group buffs. This is fine, this is a perk of being a shaman.<P>However, Druids are supposed to be the ones in tune with the Earth, and granted Natural powers. This would definately go in line with giving druids better heals. Shamans are medicine men, and should specialize mostly in their current state as group buffer and mob debuffer.<P>Being these "nature-walkers" as such, druids should have had pets, but would have terribly off-set and unbalanced them, with the Teleports we are granted. However, all druid charms, albeit extremely limited to those few areas animals can be found (animals drop crap loot, so youd only be hunting for exp anyhow), should allow the charm to be broken and the mob not aggroing you. Charms should also have the casting time reduced significantly, for without snaring your pissed little friend first, you cant land a re-charm.<P>It is absurd that druids share the same heal as Paladins until level 53. which they will get the same spell again at level 57. If you dont make druids get better heals, make higher healing spells that do the same amount of healing, but with the mana consumption significantly reduced. Druids prefer to solo, rather than pair with someone or group, because its 100x more mana efficient to sit off and not take a hit during a battle, than to waste all your mana healing your warrior.<P>Also, the idea of "thorns" and "fire" shields is a little out of whack. Unless you hit with your fists or claws as a mob, i dont see how you can take damage everytime you hit someone. Also as such, passing your hand quickly over a fire will not affect you at all (in real life) so why should punching someone encased in fire do any damage either? Spikes would hurt- yes. but back to the game. Maybe give druids the ability to lay on an attacking shield as well as a defensive damage shield. Every time you hit a mob with this damage shield, it adds extra damage. I would be happy almost with this spell ability alone.<P>Yes, druids are decent soloers, and do such most of their EQ time. However, this is extremely boring, and I often times wonder why I play the game. This new patch adressed group exp bonuses, so why shouldnt druids get better and more mana efficient group spells? Also, I cannot solo a blue mob unless i have 10 levels over it- Unless i have a whole lot of time and clarity 2 on. Necros make much better soloers, and much better "farmers", still able to take down Red mobs in some cases post 50. The form of the howler gives mana regen, in slow rate. I can spend about 20 minutes getting to FM at level 52, which is un acceptable. Shamans can Cannibalize, necros have their mana regen, wizards can, and obviously enchanters. If I try to heal for my group while the cleric is down or there is no cleric. I often have to halt operations for about 10 minutes till i get mana to the point where i can heal for another 5 minutes, which wont allow me to use my other group spells.<P>Teleports: The reason I chose this class in the first place. I whine about not being able to heal, and people say then why didnt you play a cleric. This is the reason, for I jump around the world nonstop. When one place is overcrowded Im gone, when I need to get someplace to sell or buy - I'm there. However druids need more Teleporting locations, and some others have voiced this concern. A Everfrost or qeynos hills teleport are definately in order. Yes I also agree the wind of the south and north need to be replaced by normal Circle of Emerald Jungle and Circle of Skyfire. Clerics whine and are usually always found /anon because they are bugged for Rezzes all the time, and often from people not in the same zone. However, I see no difference in people bugging druids and wizards for Teleports. First of all, if you arent bound in that exact same spot, If you teleport someone, not only is it very time consuming and takes a chunk of mana for a return ticket, but you will also have a great deal of running ahead to get back to your previous spot.<P>For those of you who have read through this post - Way to go, I know I wouldnt have with my attention span, but I cant stop myself from typing</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One thing to think about.  When one class, ie. Druids are the most played character on every server you better think any and every change you make all the way through.<P>All these people are not playing Druids without reason, and this class has a lot more checks under the Good side than the Bad.<P>Brock</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Oh yeah and while we are on the ports issue.<P>Make the Kunark ports more friendly. If we are master of travel we should be able to port to Skyfire and Emerald Jungle from anywhere. Not port to Dreadlands, run to Karnors and then port.<P>Same thing for wizzys on that issue. CoM is under used. Howling Stones to a point. Yes, well that key is another issue *snicker*. But since downtime is such a big issue for many of us it would be nice to use our ports as ports and not the staggered port - run - sone - port issue that Kunark has caused.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One more thing. I agree that druid damage spells are useless pretty much 50+ . Mobs hit too hard anyway to use it on yourself, and In a group, the members would likely choose a shaman for slow over a druid. This would certainly fall into the category, druids arent really good at one thing, and each class has its perks, but the damage on shields needs to be increased- or conditional on how much damage you take- This would remove the problem of not wanting to make more powerful damage shields for not wanting to make druids completely uber at power leveling. <P>Mobs at level 10 hits for like 18-22 damage from what i can remember. So If druids got some sort of damage shields that dealt out damage depending on how hard you were hit, might solve a number of problems. If yours hit for 10 damage maybe the shield deals out 1-2 damage.. If your hit for 150 damage it deals out 40-45 damage. This would also not affect PVP servers, for PCs obviously cant hit as hard as MOBs consistantly at that range. Although some fixed damage damage shields should stay, because a little power leveling never hurt anybody, right?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This may be redundant, but Damage Shields are currently completely uncredited.  If I DS a player and a mob beats itself to death on them, without taking any other form of damage, the MoB just poofs as if killed by an NPC.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>Some thoughts from a druid player since day 1.<P>1) Greatly reduce kiting.  I find it one of the worst aspects of the game.  My group often pulls stuff being kited by someone else.  We often get trained by people kiting.  Kiting seems to demonstrate the poor AI.  Its just irritating to watch 3 monsters running around chasing someone for 10 minutes, knowing they don't stand a chance.  The whole thing seems the antithesis of a fun group play environment.  Maybe I should have listed this last so folks will still read my post...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>2) Spirit of the Bird (fly about 40 feet of the ground)<P>3) Talk to animals.  Maybe hailing a bear enables you to say "track griffon" and the bear takes off.  Kinda like that wolf in WK that leads you to the criminal.  One of the neater quests in the game.<P>4) Summon treant.  Summon bear.  Etc.  If they're in the zone, they head towards the caster.  If not, the spell fizzles.  I would love to be able to summon help when I see dark elves slaying treants.<P>5) More faction hits for "bad" druids.  I like the roleplaying aspect of the game.  When I see druids killing the druids around the ring, it always gets me.  "But the exp is so good and its easy."  Fine, maybe next time in Kelethin you get thrown from the trees.<P>6) This isn't druid specific, but it would be nice if you could choose what to forage for.  /forage food.  /forage water.  /forage leaves.   Also be nice if you the foraging code wasn't so brain-dead.  Forage rabbits while in the middle of the ocean.<P>Silverstar<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>NO NO Effing NO!!!<P>Druids and shaman should NOT GET SUPERIOUR HEAL AT 49TH LEVEL. 53, maybe, but NOT 49. <P>Druids and shaman should NOT be main healers on raids or whatsoever. Thats what clerics are FOR. <P>If you ARE going to give it to them at 49, then give sup heal to pallys at 51.<P>I personally belive that clerics and ONLY clerics should get higher end heals (like divine light and such).

</FONT><HR>Was reading through this and only thing that stood out to me as odd was the discussion on damage shields...<P>--- snip ---<BR>&gt;”Simple: Damage shield damage gets credited to the caster if more than 8 levels above the one being casted upon- same with mages.”&lt;<P>Actually, I’ve always wondered why this damage wasn’t always credited to the caster… I’ll ask.<P>&gt;"PS The idea of DS doing netural dmg instead of caster dmg was to prevent mobs from aggroing on caster all the time (At least so I heard) After I snare mob its pissed at me already, if I have DS on my tank, It'll never get off me :/"&lt;<P>I might be wrong, but I thought that damage shields credited their damage to the person that had them on them...<BR>--- snip ---<P>Well first off... damage from damage shields is not accredited to anyone. Someone pointed that out in another post, if you have a damage shield up and it kills a mob without anyone else doing any other damage to it, the mob will poof.<P>I see two /big/ problems with having damage shield credit damage back to the caster:<P>1.) This would result in large amounts of  unavoidable agro back to the caster. I don't think I need to explain how this is bad.<P>2.) Casters could KS using damage shields. Especially if significantly higher level than the target, a caster's damage shield could easily out damage the target's damage and credit the kill back to the caster. Damage shields would prolly have to be made group-only to prevent this.<P>And of course crediting damage shield damage to the person it was casted on would only make it easier to powerlevel because then they wouldn't need to do any real damage at all to the mobs they were fighting.<P>At any rate, consider fully what you're doing to damage shields if you change how they're designed. Personally, I consider damage shields to be one of the fundamental abilities of the druid class, and one thing that makes us desirable in groups. Making them any less useful than they are now would be a very bad thing.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sorry- last post. Since you cant edit, I cant add on to my first post. How can you praise the Ice Spell Phleg? This falls into my Immolate category of completely useless. Its resisted anywhere from 50-99% of the time in my experience. I cant do anything in solb still. Normal mobs resist Ice a lot, but shouldnt these fire mobs be hit by it consistantly? You would think so but no. Fire Giants, even when Tashani'd and Malosi'd still resist ice 80% of the time for me, and no way in heck I can land a starfire (starfire should be a lightning based spell, based on name) . Druids are useless on Nagafen raids. <P>The whole fact that druids entire line of DDs was mostly based on fire is kind of lame from a roleplaying standpoint. Fire is the enemy of earth, and Druids are earth people. Druids DDs should have been more along the line of "earth" spells. Like DDs inflicting damage by giants boulders being heaved at you. This would also have taken more planning, because there would have to be a whole 'nother resistant scheme. But for now the Earthquake line of DD spells engage magical resistances, which are already useless for the reason they are point blank spells -useless for soloing because they have an uber cast time- and useless for groups because if you dont have an enchanter for mez and your fighting 3 live mobs 50+ your group pretty much is toast anyways</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>To complete the argument for superior heal at 44 for those that object:<P>We are supposed to be able to act as SECONDARY healers in some situations.  I can't keep a single tank alive with greater heal - even chain casting it I can't equal the damage a mob is doing.  Since 40s I am able to act as a healer for maybe a tertiary tank if we have an enchanter to clarity me and mez adds.  Thats not a secondary healer its a pretty useless healer... I switched specialization to evocation now because I'm more valuable as a nuker ... it costs me less mana to kill things before they kill the tanks than to heal the tanks before they die.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>And yes druids should be able to call on multiple surrounding animals like a beastmaster they are. This is pure theory, it would unbalance druids, but take something useless away like our Earth line of AOEs. Druids should get more spells from a roleplaying standpoint. The ability to change the rains, which is completely useless other than the fact it will make a lot of happy humans, is really cool. There should be more spells like this that have Tunare the earth "mother of all" backings to them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt; Fire is the enemy of earth,&lt;<P>Huh? Last I checked fire is just as natural as anything else on earth..<P>At any rate, I agree that  druids could've used some more non-fire based spells. The magic-based nukes are nice, but we don't get enough of them to cover the gap when our fire based nukes won't work.<P>Also, I've heard varying responses to the Immolate line of spells. I use them regularly without much problem.. yes they are resisted more often (because of the AC debuff component) but I would hardly call them unusable.  A few people in this thread have said that they've been resisted almost every time, but in my experices I've seen maybe a 25% resist rate.  Still quite usable imo.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There is always a lot of bickering by players when druids are discussed. Many think that druids are overpowered, others that druids do not provide enough to groups in the upper tier of play. I think this wide belief in druids ability comes from there being two distinct situations...grouping and soloing.<P>I would agree that in solo play druids are very powerful. They have a wide range of abilities, perhaps more than any other single class. In solo play this gives them a great advantage. The ability to do practically everything well makes a druid almost a one person group.<P>However, this strength in soloing is a weakness in grouping, specially in the upper levels (post 50) play. It is in this area that groups need classes that are not simply good at a skill, but are excellent at a skill. Thus the recent threads over the need for shamans to recieve an upgrade to their healing spells so that another class other than clerics be capable of providing some sort of true healing.<P>If you are asking as to what can be done to better druids in terms of solo play, I would answer nothing, as I believe druids are already plenty powerful in that catagory.<P>If on the other hand you are asking what can be done to better druids in term of group play I think minor additions that would improve one or more of their 'good' skill. More than likely though you would need to decrease other skills (thus hurting solo play) to balance this.<P>As far as other things I had always wanted to see that, while not affecting the power of the druid class would increase the enjoyment of the game from the Druid perspective. I had always wanted to see mid-level (30 to 40) druid item quests. Please don't feel a need to think that these quests must be for armor only. Perhaps a spell, weapon, or hand held item. Something to give druids quests in EverQuests.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Syndy Silvermoon - 52 Druid<BR>Kovina Bloodfang - 52 Cleric</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Zangal, I believe Shamen have the group PR and DR spells.<P>I did post on the previous thread, but I will mention the 3 things that I think should be looked into (in order of importance):<P>1. Healing Post 50 (Shamen/Paladins as well):  Clerics are required and there is no replacing a cleric with 2 or even 3 druids/shamen/paladins.<P>2. Kunark Teleports: Everyone teleports to Dreadlands, runs to Karnors, evacs to Skyfire or Emerald Jungle.  I don't think this is along the lines of how Verant seems to feel/thinks about teleporting, if you gauge their thoughts on how they dealt with Velious.<P>3. - And easily the least important - the annoying "That isn't an animal" message.  Insects, spiders, raptors, etc are all not animals.  Again, no big deal, just annoying.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Here is what i DO NOT WANT a druid to have.<P>1. I DO NOT WANT A PET!  At lvl 55 you gave us a very low lvl pet, which does very little in terms of dmg delt to mob and mob hp ect..  Doesn't help our grouping abilities.  Take it away it is a joke!<P>2. I DO NOT WANT A REZ spell.  I JUST DO NOT!  Granted i die 23047 times per lvl, i accept it, and still i do not want rez.  It is a cleric spell, or a pally spell not a druid spell.  If you want a rez spell be a cleric, the druid class is not for you.<P>3. I do not want more nukes that are fire/ice types or posion for that matter (those are shamans  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ).  Why? resistance rates are pretty high.  Our fire debuff spell is always camped and difficult to get.<P>4. I DO NOT WANT CHEALING!!! Why? that is a CLERIC ONLY spell.  AND ONLY CLERICS SHOULD HAVE!  Giveing us that spell will make us over powered even with higher mana/casting rates.  <P>5. More idiot droods that do not know how to group.  I was in a group with a druid today, and he acted as a primary healer, and i was secondary.  he nuked like he wanted to start a fire or something (he was lvl 44).  Always oom.  I on the other hand did all the snares, regen spells, and even healed almost never nuked.  From the look of things i was primary healer.  Something is wrong here.<P>To let people know why i picked the druid class.  I hate soloing, i find it extremely boreing.  And quite inefficient.  I wanted a class that i can help my GROUP with, where i can only make my group strong with my presence.  I also am a very lazy person  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif">.  I want to run fast, and have the ability to teleport myself and others as well.  Only one class that can do all that the druid.  I'm a lvl 40 druid atm 1/2 way to 41.  The mobs i am fighting are doing 100+ damage to 150+ dmg.  Even with pact regen going at all times (+5 hp a tick) i can no longer act as a healer any more.  I have sometimes left the group so the group can invite a cleric to heal in my stead because i cannot keep them alive as well as i like too.  <P>What i would like to see.<P>1. I would like to have sup healing at lvl 44 or even 49.  I have not yet experenced the fizzle rates other of my kind has complained about.  If it is so i would like to see the fizzle rate compareable to the rates of our other heals at the lvl we recieve the spell.  <P>2. Perhaps more tp areas.  In kunark i believe verant has inadverantly isolated areas due to the distance from bind and tp locations.  People have suggested Warslick woods as one.  i like that choice, my only concern is the stupid frame rate problem =p  So i would like to see a ring at the edge of the ot/WW zone, with the ring on the OT side.  Purely frame rate concers for me plus i don't want ot get lost hehe ;P  Also i would like  tp around the qeynos area.  It takes around 20 min or so to travel in that area.  As you have read above i am lazy.  Also takes another 15 min to get to ever frost.  Only once have i traveled to ever frost.  Why?? it is isolated from the surrounding areas, so i don't bother traveling up there.  A tp in the area can and perhaps open it up, might solve or help rememdy the lack of use in the permafrost zone.<P>3. DS.  Alas my druid is only lvl 40 and ds is semi effective against some lvl 43 or lvl 44 mobs.  I prefer the group i am in to fear it or i will kite it around while they peck at it.  I can't heal them when a mob dbl hits for 100+.  Only way to keep group alive.  I see the lvl 50 ds only does dmg in the 60s.  Lets see most mobs at higher lvl i would assume casts or have alot of hps.  64/18000 = 0.0035% great........<P>4. I would like a unique heal type spell.  Take our pet away, and pls give us a unique h.o.t (heal over time) spell.  All of our more efficient heals are h.o.t. cloro and regen.  Very efficent esp in the pact forms.  Also they last around 5 or so min.  Clerics get a cestrial heal that lasts around 2 or 3 ticks.  A druid version won't be as fast, probally 10 ticks (1 min.)  to do twice as much heals.  I don't think that would be over powering.  And perhaps get it around the mid 50s.  with a 10 sec recast time?<P>5. I swear this is the last ).  For role playing purposes i would love to have treant form.  In that form we can only go walking speed.  +2 mana regen +10 hp regen.  lower fire resist, but higher ice resist.  Would be nice to see a druid on one of those no?<P>This post ended up much longer than i expected  oh well.<P>Thank you for reading assumeing you did  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Kaidebx 40th druid<BR>Morrell thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor:<BR>&gt;&gt;Add a new healing spell at 55th level. My suggestion so far is Remedy – a fast casting, low healing spell, and a solid upgrade from Superior Healing that won’t really infringe on the clerics power, which lies in big healing spells.<P>The problem is that the cleric dependency is due to the big spells.  Remedy and Divine light are solid upgrades.  Great spells.  And they should be just the clerics.  The combination of these spells and high hp buffs will always make clerics the #1 healer.<P>What shamans and druids need is the effecient, big heal.  2k, 10 seconds casting, 400 mana.  This and only something like this would make them productive healers in the big situations.  It won't infringe upon a cleric, as it heals less than complete heal and the shaman/druid buffs are nowhere near as good as a clerics... unless a druid and shaman are working together.  And a druid+shaman should be able to equal a cleric.<P>To give them the better small ones cuts into the clerical healing edge without solving the main problem: shaman and druid healing is worthless against the big mobs.<P><BR>&gt;&gt;Hmmm… just a higher level version of tree form, that would come after wolf form, that is mobile… Interesting.<P>Treeform used to enable us (both druids and enchanters) to walk around.  This was changed because the shape of trees led to people falling through the earth.  Druids got compensated with their treeform being given benefits for the loss of movement.  (Enchanters, of course, didn't, but that's a matter for a later topic *grin*).<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As far as not infringing on a "cleric's role" of healing -druids, shaman AND clerics are *all* "priest classes" and I'd think healing would be within all of our roles <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Superior heal at 44 would be better than 49, imho - for shamen too. <BR>As already pointed out the damage from the damage shields are not attributed to us because we'd never be able to cast them due to being too high on the aggro list.  Although not of much use after 50, pre 50 they are one of the reasons we are accepted (not *wanted*) in groups - taking that away from us would be less group-friendly, not more.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor<BR>Station Member   posted 01-18-2001 01:02 PM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>First I want to ask you all to keep within the generally existing mechanics. We’re looking for balance, but I’m not going to bring a dozen new spell ideas to the team as a balance tool… And, realistically, we have to keep the ideas to things that won’t require a team of artists and programmers to create.<BR>Here’s what I’ve gleaned so far, filtered through my own ideas.<P>Healing:<P>Druids (and Shaman) want to be better at healing. Not only would this give them a more active roll at the end of the big raids, while at the same time reducing perceived ‘need’ for clerics at such times. But we also have to keep in mind that healing is the clerics role, and we do not want to infringe on that role.<P>So the proposal is this:<P>Move Superior Healing to 49th level.<P>Add a new healing spell at 55th level. My suggestion so far is Remedy – a fast casting, low healing spell, and a solid upgrade from Superior Healing that won’t really infringe on the clerics power, which lies in big healing spells.<P>Maybe add another healing spell at 60th level – perhaps Divine Light (though I’d rename it…)<P>::&gt;How about Divine Extra-Lite&lt;G&gt;&lt;:: Seriously, though, you could give both us and shaman serperat spells, Shamman a bit faster but slightly less mana eficient, Druids a lsightly slower but a bit more mana eficinet spell in keeping with the perceved diferences in the classes, but it would probably be best just to keep things simple.&lt;::<P>Reduce the fizzle rate on druid healing spells at the 50+ level.<BR>::&gt;Im about to have an organic experience!(Joking)&lt;::<P>More Quests: There have been repeated requests for more mid-level quests for druids. Though this isn’t really a class balance thing, I’ll keep it on this list.<P>::&gt;Actualy more Quests for Everyone, not just us Druids, the old ones are geting a bit threadbare!&lt;::<P>Charm Animals: For a long time I’ve liked the idea of a druid being able to charm pets without making them angry. But this also has a ton of gameplay issues attached to it. Keep in mind that the main drawback to charm is that aggro factor. Taking it out would require some other serious drawbacks… But I’ve also got that on my list. It should make for some interesting discussions.  The idea of making them act like enchanter pets would certainly help. &gt;” How about a High level charm animal spell that only works on animals that con kindly or amiable. If the spell works, it says "The wooly mammoth decides to join you", if it fails it says "The wooly mammoth declines your offer".”&lt; Right, something like that… <P>::&gt;i prefer Pet Guardians on the Enchanter mode, after all, when you look at "Pets" in the fiction, the Druid invariably coments "oh him, we just happen to be walking the same way&lt;::<P>New Druid Rings: I’m not likely to advocate placing new rings, those require redoing whole zones to get graphics in for them. But some of these ideas might be feasible (I’m not saying that they are good ideas, just feasible…):<P>::&gt;i may misunderstand this, but i though some itmes in the object files could be used as "Druid" or "MAge"port focuse/target items. also Both Surefalls and Gfay have a Druids Chapple with a nice big area in them, granted, that would make porting into them a pain for Evils, but then you could just use the Ruins in Permafrost as a foci for mages&lt;::<P>If we assume that trees themselves can work as foci for druid travel magics:<P>Surefall Glade<BR>Warslik Woods<BR>Greater Fay OR Lesser Fay<P>Form of the mouse! (I’m only slightly kidding, I like the idea).<P>&gt;”Simple: Damage shield damage gets credited to the caster if more than 8 levels above the one being casted upon- same with mages.”&lt;<P>Actually, I’ve always wondered why this damage wasn’t always credited to the caster… I’ll ask.<P>&gt;”Any chance of treant form?”&lt;<P>Hmmm… just a higher level version of tree form, that would come after wolf form, that is mobile… Interesting.<P>Other new forms aren’t gonna fly (heh, good pun). As I’ve said before, I’d much rather advocate the use of any free space for giving enchanters more forms.<P>As for Spirit of Wolf - part II the revenge of the doggie: I’ll suggest it, but I don’t anticipate it happening, and I’m not one that would vote for it.<P>Soloing: And, as a note, I’m not inclined to suggest improvements to the druids ability to solo. Keep in mind that we are encouraging grouping…<P>New looks: this isn’t a balance issue. But I’ll bring it up. I wouldn’t expect any new armor looks to come out as a result. Those kinds of things take a lot of resources to make. <P>Class specific armor is too heavy (Vermiculated): This is also something I can ask about. Heavier than warrior armor?<P>Faydedar: I’m pretty sure someone is looking into this beasty and his lifestyle. I’ll follow up on it.<P>Quad Kiting: My personal opinion is that the ability to do this should probably be reduced. I will probably suggest changes that have that effect. Though the only one I’ve seen (that wouldn’t also affect the rest of the gameplay for the class) that might work is to reduce the range on AoE spells…<P>NO LURES! Not gonna happen, I tells ya.<P>No resurrections either. I don’t see a need for it at all.<P>I admit that after about seven pages I started scanning instead of reading. But most of what I was seeing were repeats of the same requests. I consider that a good sign, really. But if I missed something that you don’t see above, let me know.<P>Alan<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm really not sure what could be done to make druids more balanced... I think they are great the way they are.  Perhaps more healing, but I like having a cleric around for rezzes anyway.  We make great backup healers for when the cleric is getting pounded on and the warriors haven't gotten the mob off them yet.<P>There is one issue that I do have.  I doubt anyone likes it though.  It is with scale of wolf.  I agree with it being a travelling spell.  I agree it should drop when something casts on a PC.  What I don't agree with is how little of a speed improvement over spirit of the wolf it is.  If druids are to use it as a travelling spell and take the consequences for trying to use it in that fasion, then it should be a significant improvement in speed over spirit of the wolf.  Then perhaps it would become a useful spell, and would actually get used in group settings.  Don't give us more destinations for our circle spells, just make scale of the wolf an incredibly significant improvement in speed over spirit of the wolf.<P>Wow... never knew an orc could right so well, did you? =D<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I currently play a druid and am lvl 51 right now.  I figured I would just offer my two copper pieces.  <P>I believe that druid should get a better healing ability.  It has gotten really hard to even keep casters healed with just Greater heal.  I believe that getting Superior heal before 50+ would help that out.<P>Secondly, I really would like a quest armor for mid lvls.  Something that looks original and gives us a specific look to go for.<P>Lastly, I would like to see an upgrade to our charm animal ability.  It is such a usefull spell line, yet no one uses it because of the short duration (which is almost always) and the problem of the animal aggroing after charm wears off.  From a truly asking for help from an animal when you are an nature priest should not aggro it.  Especially when one of the spells is named "Befriend Animal"  when does befriending something make it want to kill you?  Also, another suggestion to upping this line of spells would be to decrease the chance of it ending prematurely.  Having a greater chance that the spell would stick longer would make people more likely to use it.<P>Well, there are my 2 cp.

</FONT><HR>What's wrong with powerleveling? If EQ allows twinking, then powerleveling is perfectly acceptable. Besides, while the druid is an awesome powerleveler at low low levels, say up to level 20, NO ONE can out do a nice, high level monk, enchanter or necro for the BIG, BIG gains. If you need help figuring that out... well, you must not know what real powerleveling is (I'm not even going into group PLing, where a group of high levelers PL's one person). Nerfing that method of PLing would in turn nerf most of the usefulness of the enchanter. <P>Besides, clerics are almost as good at PLing as druids, just a different style.<P>And I for one am tired of the "we're balanced 1 to 50, but fix us at level 60". Hrm. While I agree that druids are awesome outside, druids stink inside at ALL levels. I would love to get into some dungeon groups, but... I'm a druid, so I don't get picked (except for some outside dungeons). Since verant is all about grouping, either A) get rid of druids and necros all together, or B) make us more group friendly, evac doesn't cut it. Which are you going to take, the guy who can restore your xp 98% or the guy who MAYBE can save your life if he has enough mana to cast it and if you are not left behind.<P>Nerf soloing? Might as well delete the class. Of course deleting the items specific to the druids wouldn't take long would it *uncontrollable laughter*.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"><P>Nerf clerics and enchanters, since they are so desired in groups, they are obviously overpowered. (This is the corollary to the argument that druids are overpowered because they solo things other classes can't)  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"><P>Anyways, what is the big deal if druids can solo and level faster than the rest? Sure isn't because they can get the better loot and go in the cool dungeons/raids. What good is being level 60 if all you can do is solo creatures that drop cloth caps and 8 copper (oops, did I just describe the average frontier mountains 30+ loot?)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"Druids (and Shaman) want to be better at healing. Not only would this give them a more active roll at the end of the big raids, while at the same time reducing perceived ‘need’ for clerics at such times. But we also have to keep in mind that healing is the clerics role, and we do not want to infringe on that role.<P>So the proposal is this:<P>Move Superior Healing to 49th level.<P>Add a new healing spell at 55th level. My suggestion so far is Remedy – a fast casting, low healing spell, and a solid upgrade from Superior Healing that won’t really infringe on the clerics power, which lies in big healing spells.<P>Maybe add another healing spell at 60th level – perhaps Divine Light (though I’d rename it…)"<P>And a collective sigh of relief fell over the cleric community.

</FONT><HR>im reposting to see if anyone liked the idea 8/<P>Silence = This spell occurs in D&D and you have given it to a Trent in POG, it would be a level<BR>55 spell and single target only and would not be resisted by uber mobs. <BR>My reasons for this are.<P>(1) Most monsters in the level 50 + range use magic as a secondary ability. The fact is most <BR>of these mobs hit for ungodly damage and thats all they really do. The usually spells include <BR>Complete Heal, Slow, Dispell, and HP and AC buffs. Some monsters do cast some dots or poison <BR>spells ect but, there main damage is in melle. <P>(2) This spell would not stop Death Touch's, Proc's, and the ability for a monster to summon you.<BR>this spell would be marked the same as the lure line of wizard spells.<P>(3) the Down side of this spells is, yes druid would be able to kite casters, but there is one problem. <BR>Most level 55 + monsters resist your spells and well I dont have enuff mana to kill even a 32k hp <BR>monster, and most monsters at this level summon you.<P><BR>Evac's = as it stands one of the main reasons I or a wizard could get a group was your ability<BR>to evac/ port people around. As it stands this ability has ben almost totally taken away<BR>from use in the new expansion. also because of this many of your new absolutely<BR>wonderfull zones are very under used. Currently you need faction to use the<BR>limited ports in the new expansion.<P>(P.S. Building a fancy zone no one really go's to is a waste of time and money on your part)<P><BR>Healing = as is Super Heal fizzle rate is horrid. I currently always fizzle the first time I<BR>cast Super Heal. On an average I fizzle 3 times in a row before i can get the spell off. To <BR>be more of a back up healer I beleave I should be able to heal a caster to full hp and a <BR>tank to half his hp. this would not step on the toe's of Clerics. How this is done could <BR>be a new heal spell at 56. Your biggest problem is this curve that occurs in the hp and <BR>ac after level 50. The jump form say 800 to 1000 hp heal to a full Complete heal of a tank <BR>who has no less then 4000 hp and up to 8000hp. It is because of this steeply climbing curve <BR>in the amount of Hit points that is the cause of most of your problems for other class's<P><BR>Well im not going to ramble on some more but, Frankly nothing really worth bringing a druid on a raid will happen. <BR>Most of your problems are with he new expansion. Sure Druids can solo. So can half the class's in the game and, <BR>where not the best at it.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>What I'd like to see changed in the druid class.<P>Make the "Firefist" spell targeted instead of self only. Add a "Flame Fist" spell with an appropriate amount of +ATK at 29 (say +30 ATK), an "Inferno Fist" spell at 39 or 44 (say +50 ATK)and a "Furious Fists" spell in the mid 50s (+100 ATK?) This is in keeping with the priestly classes being buffers and is unique to druids. <P>Get us a spell that reduces the ATK of mobs, something to make them miss more or hit for less. This isn't going to make the solo druid more powerfull, you're doing something wrong if you're hit while soloing anyhow. <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">Also should stack with shaman/enchanter slow/cripple lines. <P>I think Superior Heal ought to be given out at 39 following the scheme of the rest of the heal spell s up to 29.. ie shaman and druid get it 5 levels later. I also think that clerics need to get a few more buffs at earlier levels, like sow and strength.. but thats for another thread  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>The theme here is that of the three priestly classes Clerics are the best straight healers and the best at AC and HP buffs, Shaman are the best at Stat Buffs, best slowers, second class healers, Druids are first class ATK buffers,best utility (ports) and second class healers.<P>What I wouldn't mind losing... well nothing.. <BR>What I could live without..<BR>     All direct nukes.. yes this would make it harder to solo.. so what, it'd still be doable with dots and the DD from our roots.. and it'd kill quad kiting.
