</FONT><HR>It seems there is alot of complaint about our offense.  I agree, it is REALLY bad hehe.  I tend to miss more than I hit with my 2hs and that makes it tough.  How can we taunt if all we do is miss?  Our new defensive skills will be wasted if we can't get the creature to pay attention to us.  <P>How about raising our 1hs and bash skill up real high.  This would give us some offense, but keep us below the pure melee classes simply cuase there aren't many real damaging 1hs weapons out there.  At lest not many with a decent dmg/dly ratio.  <P>I would also like to see paladins get the rez line sooner.  How about revive at 39, and resuscitate &lt;sp?&gt; at 49?  Then give us resurection at 59.  This seems like a good idea to me.  Our guild only has one cleric at the moment and he is not always on....which means at level 50, alot of us are eating deaths.  It would be nice if I could step in and at least give a 40% rez to them.<P>The last thing I would like to see is moving Superior heal up a bit.  I feel we should be able to step in as a cleric if situation calls for it. I think we should get it in the lower 50's while it is still usefull.  By the time we reach 50, greater heal doesn't help a whole lot.<P>Cae</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A few things I'd like you to take to the team Absor:<P>1) Offense:  You could make our cap 300 for offense and 1HS and we would still not outdamage dual wielders.  Along the lines of 235-240 would not be over powered.<P>2) Defense:  I have a lot of Ranger friends; every single one has higher AC then me by, at the least, 30+ points.  We are similarly equipped and I use a shield from the Plane of Hate...whereas they use another weapon.  I wear full plate (admittedly a lot of it is Ro since valorium is a myth and I refuse to join a uber guild to get the equipment just to be a decent tank in the game).  Their self only spells stack, give them a dmg shield *and* nice AC.  Then they get all kinds of attack buffing spells.  I am 51 and my ranger friends at 40 had more AC =).  Chain sure has protective properties I never knew about =).<P>3)  Spells:  What can one say?  Stacking spells are where its at.  We *need* and I do mean need, spells that stack with cleric spells.  Clerics are  the most wanted and probably the most powerful class in the game...they're not going to go anywhere if we can add to their buffs.  Healing...since we can't melee worth a darn, or takes hits like the light tanks can...maybe we could heal a bit better?  The current healing spells being put in are, and I don't intend disrepect, jokes.  Resist Disease I honestly thought was someone just releasing false information to bu funny.  Rangers got a *great* AC/ATTK buff, SK's got the 44 necro summon corpse; both great spells.  And being the weakes of the 3 we got another useless spell?  The group heal spell is just silly.  I'd never mem it.  Flame of Light might be usefull if the recast time were less.  Lastly we could use the 39 cleric exp rez at 49.  SK's got Summon Corpse from their parents 44 collection...and I am happy for them.  Perhaps we could be seen a little more useful getting a spell from our parents 39 collection?<P>4)  The casting penalty:  I would argue that this is no longer neccesary; in fact specialization may now be in order.  Most of my career I could back up a druid or shaman in healing; now they get sup heal 6 levels before me -- not bad except those 6 levels are approximately 4 months if people "allowing" me in their group if they are desparate enough to take a Paladin..and if I play 8+ hours a day.  We will never have near the wis priests do, we can't do anything else really so maybe we can heal better and more often.  <P>5)  Weapon selection:  Paladins have the worst selection in the game currently (among melee's).  We need some more *obtainable* weapons.  Not the kind that I need 30 people to get.  I think most people are worn out of the fact that tieing ones shoe post 50 is epic.  Going from one zone to another is epic...ahh thats for another post.<P>6)  Travel:  We're pretty poor tanks honestly; druid and shaman again are way ahead of us in healing; all of our buffs are obsolete and overwritten.  We have to do a lot of travelling to find people willing to group with us for those reason.  Perhaps some travel aids are in order.  Some form of speed increase for those without Jboots...maybe a levitate type spell.  Something.  We can't even travel..or tank...or heal..or buff.  There must be some bone we can have.<P>7) Uniqueness:  I can't say it enough, thats what it all comes down too.  Making Paladins a poor tanks with awful dmg output and obsolete/useless buffs and weak healing spells...we need to be unique and get away from just being watered down things.  If need be remove cleric spells and replace them with our own.  Give us unique melee abilities instead of watered down (and I do mean watered down) warrior stuff.<P>Thanks I do hope you'll consider more the what is on your list.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Could you add something about our Rez line?<BR>As it is, only one class can really provide ressurections. And that is the Cleric, until level 59 when a Paladin gets a 90% rez.<P>SoW is shared by Rangers, Druids, and Shamans.<BR>TPs are shared by Wizards and Druids<BR>...and so on.<P>XP rezzes however? Just one, the cleric. The no-XP rez doesn't come until 49, at which point my groupmates don't was a revive because they want to save the corpse for a possible XP rez.<P>I am not thinking anything major. What I'd propose is bump the level 49 No XP rez down to level 39 and add the 50% rez (which the paladin does not currently have) at level 49. This will relieve the dependency on one class in both raid situations and grouping situations. (Clerics have THE tank buffs, healing, and rezzes department cornered for the most part.)<P>I realise Verant does not want to cross more skills, but two monopolies on raids (Healing and Rezzing at least) are under the Cleric. The Paladin currently has none.<P>I hope that our Cleric brethern will not scream too loudly at this...but I really think there should be NO situation where a certain realm of downtime is cornered by one class. (In this instance, downtime caused by xp loss and CR time.)<P>With these changes, we will still be a full rank behind Clerics in rezzes, and we never get the 96%er.<P>-i just thought this post was so good and important i had to repost it! </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yes paladins will never heal as well as clerics but why can't we buff exactly the same as clerics.  Healing is the clerics true role but buffing could be downloaded to paladins conserving cleric mana.  Clerics will still be needed for their healing.  <P>Ressurecting could also be offloaded to paladins as most clerics view it as a pain to be constantly sent tells for resses.  Thus paladins should res at the same levels as clerics.  Maybe an epic quest centered around a 'holy sprinkler' for paladins.<P>Akrux Daprovisioner<BR>Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The one thing that I would like to see is that beyond Ghoulbane all of our quest swords are two-handed.  I think everyone has agreed that Paladins should be 1HS and Shield.  Can we adjust our epic to be a 1HS and Shield.  Kind of like the warriors get two cool 1HS weapons.  1HS and Shield should defenitely be our specialty since we are defensive in nature and the Shield gives us extra AC and stun capability.<P>The last thing I have is total agreement on the surcoat thing.  I think there should be a near epic level BP that we can quest for that gives us a plate with surcoat looking BP with an emblem of our God on it.  That would be absolutely rocking.<P>I also like the previously suggested Undead Only Damage Shield.<P>Kindring GoldenBlade<BR>44 Paladin of Tunare<BR>Sacrament, Povar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>If they DO give us an undead only Damage Shield, it has to be high enough to make a noticeable difference - make it higher than druid or mage damage shields since it's UNDEAD only and would give us something unique. I'm thinking 50 pt. damage shield.  Either make it high like that or make it stack with all other damage shields and be about a 25pt. dmg shield.  Make it a group buff too.<P>Then again there is so few undead 50+ maybe we're barkin up the wrong tree.  However, improvements in the vs. undead area do not tread on other classes' toes and we have a much wider margin for improvements here /shrug.<P>Regardless, I would like our hit/miss ratio to be looked at!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I still think Pally Armor is To Rare.  When you see mid 50's still in a hodge podge of Armor of Ro, Valorium, and Deepwater its not a good sign.  Armor of Ro is good for to about 40, then we cant get Valorium readily to 48+ (if it drops, lots of bracers and nothing else dropping lately), then the camp-a-thon over several different zones trying to get DW.  Make every DW piece except chest piece drop in Karnors, Sebillis, and Howling Stones so it is possible to get it.<P>I would not care at all about raising any defensive stat for Palladins IF I could get my armor.<P>PS Before I get flamed I play an awful lot to have as little armor as I do.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>All this talk about the new discipline idea of taking half damage from a party member is completely missing the point of making us useful on a raid.  This super taunt, or victim replacement would only be useful if we actually replaced the attacked member completely.  This would allow the enchanter trying to mez, druid trying to evac, or cleric trying to heal to actually get their spell off.  Only if we could literally pull all the mobs off of a selected target would this have any worth.  Yes, I know it could mean death for the paladin, but lets be honest.  If you choose to play a Paladin, you should realize that a holy knight will sacrifice himself for his cause (protecting his companions).  This would be one ability that no one else can do.  And it really doesnt make us anymore powerful, so I doubt anyone would complain.  Basically, it just gives us a purpose to be in a group.<P>Jaybartu</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ok, no offence Absor, but i think you misunderstand some of what paladins are missing.<P><BR>taunting. Paladins, like shadowknights are tied as the SECOND best taunters in game, followed only by rangers. (and rangers never try to taunt, else they die)<P><BR>Stunning.  shadowknights cant stun.  we have three spells for stunning, and they all become ineffective 56+. its especially annoying when a mob tries to gater and we can not interrupt, or when they CH.<P><BR>Offence. yup, we need more,  the numbers of times we miss while swinging at stuff is pitiful. Rangers have offence equal to that of warriors, and weaponds comparable or in some cases better than warriors. Unless you give us ARMOR with equvalent AC to that of warriors (along with dodge, parry, repost, etc skills to that of a warrior) we will never be on par with a tanks ability to 'tank.' i Strongly urge you to bump our offence up some, so what we lack in the tanking department, we can attempt to make up with offence.<P>along with superior healing fizzeling, could you look into bumping the spell down a level or two?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

After all we are the true fear of the dead.<P>I would also like to see paladins get a better heal and fizzle less. Now that druids and shamans will get a better heal I think that paladins should also get a better heal. Right now they are a back up healer but now they will turn into useless healers.

</FONT><HR>Ok.. just real simple message.<P>1.) Your not the backup healers... druids and shaman are.. your what is called tertiary healers... giving you druid level healing is just plain silly.  <P>2.) You are defensive hybrids most of you agree.. why are some of you whining for OFFENSIVE?  Do the math.. offensive + defensive specialists = warrior with spells.. ain't gunna happen.<P>3.) mage pets can out dmg you because they are WARRIORS... hense why they don't cast a few dozen different spells... they also have less hps than you... if they were out damaging rangers or warriors it would be an issue.<P>4.) They can't let bash work on uber mobs.  If they did it would be perma stunned by the 10 paladins on the raid... never get off a single hit and die.. that would be unbalancing.. they should give you a post 50 skill with a longer reset rate with a stun on it... that would not be too bad.<P>5.) Yes please let them trade in the 2 hander fro a sword/shield combo... it is only fair... these guys are defensive.. they need a defensive epic.<P>6.) Please raise thier defense<P>7.) Please let them wear white plate.<P>8.) What the hell is the guy talking about a 50% exp res at lvl 49?  Your a paladin man... not a cleric.. you are starting to infrige upon thier turf. 50% by lvl 52 would not be too bad.  using SoW to justify Resses is just silly... rangers don't get SoW until what lvl?  It's more than 20 levels behind I am pretty sure.  Rangers ae warrior/druids paladins warrior/cleric.. if ress is what keeps the cleric an important clas than you should always be just as far behind per spell as the rangers are to sow. so if (levels here are wrong) Sow - Dru 14 Ranger 44 than 50% - Clr 39 pal 69.  Frankly I think your doing pretty damn well in this line of spells as it is. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm gonna keep beathing of the head til I hear a damn response. <P>"Paladins have a similar problem. The drop rate again is not the problem, it is the number of spawns. And in our case, it is the nature of the spawns. Count how many Male Fetid Feind Spawns there are? Find any? That's right, there are NONE. There are Fetid Feind spawns that have a 50/50 chance of spawning a male or female fetid feind. This can mean that entire clearing of the plane of fear can find as little as 0 male fetid fiends and as many as all fetid feinds, leading to a famine or feast approach. I think most paladins would prefer to have to the static spawns set to 80% male, 20% female (since there are more Valorium peices needed to drop as opposed to the belt dropped by the female version). You can leave the roamers on this random spawn, since it adds the flavor that was intended without penalizing paladins."<P>This was on thread 1 <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif">g6 on the paladin talks. This best decribes the problem with Valorium drops. Not only that,but what's the point of Shadowknights or any other classes other than Rangers/druids/wizards to come back to fear? There is no new incentive because PoG drops better crap.   <P>Thread 3 pg 2, Jehred has an identical same evaluation as myself in terms of the equipment balance.<P>Doesn't anyone else see the problem with PoG drops? No one seems to be commenting on this which leads me to assume no one knows how good the armor is in PoG. If you dont, I can tell you it puts Kunark armor to shame. Plus by putting it in a very acessible zone, you're talking 24/7 pharming whenever mobs pop up there. <P>So as our SK brothers are getting better stuff, we're getting screwed yet again. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Why are people talking about item graphics, pre-50 spells (I was happy pre-50), weapons (you're STILL going to miss), armour (we can get huge AC - that's not the problem), and resses (be nice but that ain't gunna balance anything).<P>Every single class fits into 2 rolls.  Damage.  and Healing / Preventing Damage. We need to fit into one of these effectively.  Depending on how verant wants to go about it I'd be happy with any of these,<P>a) Taking Damage - there is no point being a better tank when you can have the best one.  Defensive tanks do NOT stack, you almost never need a 2nd one and therefor being 2nd best isn't good enough.<P>-If this route is to be taken (taking damage roll), then we have to be BETTER at it then warriors are, otherwise, groups will just pick a warrior.<P>b) Damage roll.  And personally I don't like this one cuz it isn't what paladins were designed for.<P>- If we go this way we would have to do damage on par with all the other damage dealers.  I'm talking like 75% warrior damage or so.  Damage stacks after all, and more to the point it's needed 100% of the time.  "Backup abilities" aren't needed 100% of the time - that's why nobody cares if you have LH.<P>c) Preventing Damage - we can be supplemental damage suppressors.  This is my favourite - pre 50, our heals were quite effective, greater heal does a good bubble on casters, and keeps a tank alive for 3-ish rounds so the CH can land on them.  We can hit stuns, which if you ask a cleric when used well prevents a LOT of damage.  And if the situation gets sticky we can even crowd control with root.<P>-If this route is taken we have to be able to heal effectively - superior heal at 53 like everyone else.  Our stuns have to hit, and stun.  Not just disrupt spells, they have to STOP DAMAGE for the 2 seconds.  And root has to be upgraded to immobilize somewhere around 51-53ish.  Past that in the 58-60 range, we could use celestial healing or some sup.heal upgrade.  We could use one more stun (how about the 53, and say 60? stuns are effective against giants?), and upgrade immobilize.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>On White Armor:<P>If I remember correctly, this item was brought up a long time ago, and while well liked, was not possible at the time. Due to the limitations of the EQ engine coupled with those of the version of DirectX we were using, the colour White was recognized by EQ as an absence of colour. However, they could not assign "no colour" to an item texture, so this idea had to be put away. If you carefully examine Gossamer robes, you will notice they aren't truely white, but a variation of it.<P>Now that the engine has been updated and we are using DX7, this idea may be feasible, and I for one would love to see it happen, maybe to Armor of Ro as was originally suggested, or to a new armor if this isn't feasible. <P>Just thought I'd throw that in for no reason, maybe I don't remember correctly and that wasn't why there's been no white armor.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ITEM: New Discipline Idea.<P>DESCRIPTION: There is an interesting idea floating around for a discipline that would help make the paladin more useful on raids. It would allow the paladin to target a PC and, for the duration of the discipline, take half of the target’s damage in his stead. So if the target is hit for 100 points, the paladin would take 50 and the target would take 50. The restriction on this would be that the paladin had to remain within melee range of the target and that it would not stop AoE spells or environmental damage. The idea is that the paladin is throwing himself in the way to protect the target.<P>---<P>I originally suggested this /defend &lt;target&gt; skill, although I got the glimmer of this idea from someone else.  There was more to it than just taking 50% of the damage.<P>As listed above, its usefulness is limited.  If the Paladin is protecting a caster (low AC, low HP), taking 50% of the damage will help - but not a lot.  The paladin's AC and defensive skills need to be shared.  For instance, if the Paladin has a AC 20 shield, the AC of the caster could go up be 20 and the Paladin down by 20.  Also, the Paladin should be able to Parry and Riposte for the caster.  (Of course, the Paladin can't block for the caster).<P>It doesn't make sense for 1 hit to hit two PC's, as the 50% dmg sharing implies.<P>But it would be cool to see.<P>A beast tried to hit YOU but a paladin parried the attack.<BR>A beast tried to hit YOU but a paladin took the blow.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>  I must say that what I feel is the most pressing issue facing Paladins lack of desirability in groups and lack of viability as a class as a whole isn't even on this list.<P>  The simple fact is that as things stand now with our offensive caps so low we do virtually NO noticable damage.  On my very best day I can't even do half the damage that a warrior can do and can't take as much damage either.  We only wield one sword (which is fine)  but when you miss on 40% of your swings, because you only gain 15 skill points in melee categories in your last 21 levels of play it just becomes pathetic.  Just think about that in the 21 levels passed 39, a class that is suppossed to be a tank gains just 15 points in their melee skills. <P>  This being said what do Paladins bring to the group that makes up for this great disparity in damage and lowered defenses?  We heal during downtime?  We have AC buffs from 20 levels ago?  Once every 70 minutes or so we get an almost complete heal?  Is it any wonder we can't get groups?<P>  As a knight there is nothing more disheartening than to see the endless string of misses that I compile nightly and the constant feeling that I am simply letting my group down.  Paladins need an increase in there offensive out put more than anything.<P>  I think that an increase of 10 to 20 points accross the bourd to offense and our weapon skills will do more than anything to balance out our greatly underpowered class.  This will not put us close enough to warriors in these catagories to cause any great imbalancing as with duel wield and kick they will still far out damage us.  This will simply make the knights of Norrath, well, more like knights.<P>  I dont think this will solve all the paladins problems, but if implemented along with the list allready put together, it should work wonders to make paladins viable again.<BR>  <BR>  I just hope the people at Verant will at some point realise how frustrating it is to have poured countless months of play time into a character only to find out when you have reached the pinnacle, and what should be the funnest part of the game, that your class is a veritable group outcast and for the most part ueseless.<P><BR>/ooc Paladin LFG  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Pepto-RoS:<P>Regarding your point #8 about the possibility of Pallies getting xp rezzes at 49, you argued that it would infringe on cleric's turf. I strongly disagree. Can you honestly say you know of ANY 49+ player who would accept a 50% rez if there was even the slightest possibility of getting a 90% rez (from a cleric?). Somehow I doubt it. It would simply make paladins a) more fun to play, and b) would make clerics less REQUIRED in 49+ groups. That's what balance is about, no one class should be required in a group - and clerics would still be highly sought after - paladins would merely fill the role in a group when no cleric was available.<P>Besides, I know a few clerics who would welcome the idea of paladins taking on some of the "can anyone xp rez me plz?" burden. Many would complain, of course - no one likes change - but truly it would not do any harm to clerics group desirability. It would just make grouping without a cleric POSSIBLE when one isn't available.<P>Oh, and according to eq.castersrealm.com, Rangers now get SOW at level 30 on Test (insert usual disclaimer about changes on test not necessarily blah blah blah). And I'm in favor of that (or at least have no problem with it). Currently Paladins get Revive (non-xp rez) at 49. That's not balanced, and it's not right.<P>Revive at 39, 50% rez at 49, etc. would go a long way towards balancing both paladins AND clerics.<P>-Caedebald Goldheart<BR>Prime of Paladins<BR>Order of the Silver Drakes<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Pepto_RoS:<P>1) Healing: It benefits everyone, and no Paladin can match the mana supply of the priests anyway.  We've had the same healing as druid/shaman for most of the game and that is part of what made us a decent class pre-50.<P>2) Offense:  We're not the defensive tanks we're told we are.  My similarly equipped ranger friends have better AC then me; *more* original, not to mention *good* spells then I do.  Again, it hurts no one if we can actually hit the mobs at this level.<P>3) Mage pets:  Yeah, they outdamage warriors and rangers hands down.  In fact, a mage pets 10 levels lower then warrior owns the warrior (unless he has equipment better then his level can normally obtain).  This is post 50, not so bad pre.<P>4) Rez:  The level 39 (30% rez spell) at level 49 is not such a bad thing.  A cleric still owns that area since people will still pay large amounts of cash and drag the corpse anywhere for the 90% at that level.  All this would do is: 1) Lower the number of people that (due to lack of funds/connections) take full exp hits with deaths. 2) Give us a spell that can be used on a raid if all the clerics fall.  I've offered my no exp rez everytime all the clerics fall in a battle.  It's always refused and there we go rebreaking a plane over it.  That of course is personal choice for those people; however they may be a tad more willing to take a 70% loss as opposed to 100% loss.  It's not crazy to suggest that spell at all.  <P>The question to ask:  Why choose a paladin over<BR>1) Warrior -- Way more HP, AC, dmg output and nice defensive disciplines.<BR>2) Rogue -- Way way more dmg output, similar HP, higher AC.  Hide/sneak to get those hard-to-reach corpses, nice disciplines.<BR>3) Monk -- Phenomenal dmg output, much higher AC, fewer HP.  Feign death for breaking up those spawns, mending constantly for nice self healing when needed, nice disciplines.<BR>4)Paladin -- *Way* lower dmg output then any of those classes.  Lower AC/defense then any of those classes. Moderate HP. Can "CH" once every 72 minutes. Useless buffs/heals at those levels.  No useful disciplines.  No special skills to help the group(s).<P>There is a problem that may someday be seen, if anyone that does *not* play a Paladin will stop making assumptions.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I like all the points above and really hope all of them will be implemented. Nevertheless, I have 2cp of my own want to add to he list.<P>My Idea:<P>1) While you make 1hs + shield a much better option for pal/sk (with block skills/better shield/better 1hs for pal/sk) , please try to keep 2hs a valid choice for us. I would love to be able to switch weapons depends on situation. (ie use 2hs to deal more damage when I don’t need to tank as much, and switch to 1hs + shield if my defensive ability is needed) According to ur list I think 2hs is underminded for pally (ie. A 2hs pally don’t stand a chance in front of a 1hs+shield one). Therefore :<BR>i) our 2hs / offense cap rasied to a point that if we use 2hs we got 80% dmg output of a warrior<BR>        such that paladin will be less efficient than warrior with the same 2hs weapon and we don’t have crit hits/kicks etc.<P>2) Now even cleric might got self invis…….I am very confuse…….that means ALL classes can invis (count hide/sneak in) in this game except paladin???? What’s the point of it????  And where alchemy stands in this kind of world?? Alchemy should be fun for shaman but in fact not many is buying their potions. Therefore :<BR>ii a) remove the invis effect on the warrior armor, now that  invis potions might become popular (or even needed) for pally and war.<BR>ii b) give pally self-invis too, altho I don’t like this idea too much, but it’s simply un-balance if pally is left alone without invis.<BR>      <BR>        The point of alchemy is to give spell casting ability (mostly utility spells) to the ones who can’t, I    <BR>know it’s a nerf for warrior class and they won’t like it but I think it’s needed and the right thing to do to make alchemy useful again. I also looked at the warrior fix list and if warrior got most of those, they shouldn’t mind to lose some spell casting ability (invis for a warrior is just s spoiler man!). After all, It’s not an RPG anymore if warrior can cast shrink/invis (and whatever else they got) to himself.<P>	In fact, I encourage nerfing if it’s the right thing to do. For example, invis vs undead for wiz? Why? Invis for clerics? Oh well …no comment (just because u make cleric so weak when melee and not having decent nuke spells). Invis/ shrink for warrior?? Does “warrior” mean something new nowadays? Flame of light for paladin?? I didn’t know they like to play with fire. There must be some more I missed, but remember this is a BIG fix of all classes now, so don’t worry and do it. If the classes are really balance after that, I don’t think anyone will have anything to say. <P>Note: please balance the classes in terms of their ability and potential strategic values in groups. Don’t balance us base on how we can do on certain mobs, otherwise we will be unbalance again when u try to create new type of mobs. IT is fine and very reasonable that some class do better on certain mobs and the other do worse, just don’t make it such that warrior/monk/rogue always the best and sk/pal/rng rated second. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Paladins:<P><BR>ITEM: Defensive Skills.<P>DESCRIPTION: Paladins would like an increase in their defensive skills, those like Dodge, Parry and Riposte. Obviously a paladin should be a good warrior, and the design was that they would be better at defense than offense. But in making any adjustment to these skills, the paladin should not become a better tank than a warrior.<P>STATUS: None<P>NOTE: An increase to levels above those of warriors in the listed skills would not be enough to make a paladin a better tank than a warrior.  Warriors still have more hitpoints, high natural magic resistance, and due to the nature of their equipment, generally higher dexterity, and agility.  Not that i'm even asking for higher skill caps, but at least equallity in this area.<BR>---<P>ITEM: Divine Strength Stacking.<P>DESCRIPTION: It seems that this spell does not stack with the 50th level ranger buff Call of Earth. As these seem to be two of the defining spells for those classes at those levels, they would like them to stack.<P>STATUS: None<P>NOTE: I only have 15 slots for buffs as it is, and when i fight an epic mob, they're always full.  Stacking these seems to be a minor concern as there's plenty of more important buffs to get.<BR>---<P>ITEM: Stunning.<P>DESCRIPTION: Paladins, like shadow knights, would like to be able to stun more things at higher levels. Perhaps allowing stuns to work on some of the more powerful monsters would not be unbalancing. This might be an interesting idea in conjunction with some other ideas on this list, and might be useful in making the sword and shield combination the signature of the knight classes.<P>STATUS: None<P>NOTE: The removal of a paladin's ability to stun a mob is truly a slap in the face.  One of the things that makes a paladin useful against lower level mobs is the ability to intterupt casting, and reduce the amount of damage output of a mob through judicous use of stuns/bash.  <BR>---<P>ITEM: Bash.<P>DESCRIPTION: Not only raise the skill cap on this, but perhaps even base a discipline on it. Perhaps one that would allow all bashes to stun (and against any creature) for the duration. Perhaps even allowing critical hits with the shield. Again, this might help define the knight hybrids as users of the sword and shield.<P>STATUS: None<P>NOTE: Happy with this one.<BR>---<P>ITEM: Lay on Hands.<P>DESCRIPTION: There are several requests to make this power better. Giving it the effect of Complete Heal, allowing it to heal a value equal to the paladin’s base (unbuffed) hit points, reducing the reuse time gradually for levels over 50 and even a discipline that would turn it into a group Lay on Hands. Also, it would be nice if there was no way that a paladin could use up his Lay on Hands on an invalid target.<P>STATUS: None<P>NOTE: Previous to the recent upgrade in effectiveness of LoH, I was only getting back ~3-3.5 bubs of health when using LoH on myself at lvl 53 with only self buffs up.  Recently I managed to fully heal myself with a combination of cleric and shammy buffs, so at least up to lvl 53 the power of this ability seems to be fine.  The inability to cast it on invalid targets however is a great idea.  I can't tell you how frustrating it is to target someone, click LoH and due to a targeting bug (targeting a monster that is infront of where the button is on the screen) that my LoH goes to waste, and in many cases causes the death of the entire group.<BR>---<P>ITEM: Yaulp IV.<P>DESCRIPTION: There have been requests to add this spell to their lineup at level 59.<P>STATUS: None<P>NOTE: I don't know any paladins that use any of the previous spells in the yaulp series after the early levels, but as long as it doesn't supplant a more important issue, it's not a horrible idea<BR>---<P>ITEM: Increased Taunt.<P>DESCRIPTION: With their somewhat limited ability to deal damage, paladins might have trouble taunting. They would like an increase in their ability to taunt.<P>STATUS: None<P>NOTE: This is one of my biggest issues with the paladin class.  Yes, as many of my brethren have pointed out, paladins have the ability to gain aggro like no other tank (except for a debuff crazy sk).  The problem however is in how long it takes to do so, and how much mana it eats.  If i need to cast 4 stuns to taunt a mob off a caster, and one or two of them are resisted, chances are the caster is dead.  And as for taking a mob off a warrior, or other tank/melee, by the time i can work up an unshakable aggro, the warrior's at 2.5-3 bubs of life, and it would be better for them to keep taking hits to let CH be more mana efficient, and hey... as it is, the warrior's gonna be better prepared to take the hits anyway.  One proposed solution is improved offence, and while that's something that we need anyway it's a seperate issue.  A good fix would be an increase in the paladin's taunt skill.<P>---<P>ITEM: Shields.<P>DESCRIPTION: Perhaps creating better shields for knights. Ones with better armor class. Perhaps even finding a way to make shields that can proc on a successful bash.<P>STATUS: None<P>NOTES: Hmmmm.... procs to me seem to be less important for a defensive tank than ac/stats on a shield, though it would be a fun toy.  The ac issue is certainly a problem though.  The higest ac shield that i can wield currently is 25ac.  The exception to this is the orb of the frozen void (35ac, and lots of yummy stats), i believe... and it's all/all.    <BR>---<P>ITEM: Wave of Healing.<P>DESCRIPTION: The recast time on this spell is 1 minute. That seems pretty long for a 200 hit point group healing spell.<P>STATUS: None<P>NOTE: I don't have this spell, so i can't be certain, but yeah, as a utillity spell it seems pretty worthless.  However, where it shines i'm told is as a taunt.  Perhaps that should be the purpose of this spell after all as an alternative to stuns?<BR>---<P>ITEM: Celestial Cleansing.<P>DESCRIPTION: This spell might not really be an upgrade to Superior Healing. And the 30 second recast time makes it less appealing.<P>STATUS: None<P>NOTE: Not familiar with this issue really...<BR>---<P>ITEM: Flame of Light.<P>DESCRIPTION: It seems that this spell does not have a particle effect.<P>STATUS: None<P>NOTE: ummmm... isn't this thread about balance? I know that when i play, 90% of the time i have particle effects turned off anyway.  This prolly should be fixed, but should NOT be a priority, or even listed as a classbalance concern at all =(<BR>---<P>ITEM: Holy Forge.<P>DESCRIPTION: Most paladins are unhappy with this discipline. They would rather see it replaced with a more defensive (or THE Defensive) discipline. It seems like it might be a fair idea to allow them to have critical hits on undead at all times (though perhaps at a lower rate) once they pass the level where they get Holy Forge now. If a replacement discipline is chosen, a shield block or bash-based discipline might be the direction to go.<P>STATUS: None<P>NOTE: Crits and Crips.... eye candy, and not good for much else.  Everyone i've seen who's done an analysis of the damage contributed by crits and crips has come up with a number less than 5%.  Again, something that would be nice in the case of all time crits/crips versus undead, but does nothing for the balance of the class.  Making holyforge give nothing but crits and crips on every succesful hit, well... by the time you get holyforge there's such a limited usefulness to skill at undead fighting that it still would be an underused discipline.  A defensive discipline would seem to be more in order (after all the offensive hybrid gets evasive...)<BR>---<P>ITEM: Divine Glory (53).<P>DESCRIPTION: Some paladins feel that this spell is underpowered, especially when compared to the 51st level ranger spell Strength of Nature. Divine Glory is a 100 hit point buff. Strength of Nature buffs 75 hit points and 25 attack.<P>STATUS: None<P>NOTE: Not a big issue here really... pure attack buffs don't seem to do much to influence the outcome of a fight, but a few extra hitpoints can... mebbe making divine glory a 125 hp buff is the answer?<BR>---<P>ITEM: Divine Favor (55).<P>DESCRIPTION: Some think that the long recast time on this spell is out of proportion to its usefulness.<P>STATUS: None<P>NOTE: Not familiar with this one either<BR>---<P>ITEM: Piercing Skill.<P>DESCRIPTION: Since two-handed piercing is based on the piercing skill, perhaps we should raise the skill cap for the knight classes in this skill.<P>STATUS: None<P>NOTE: Makes sence to me... else why would we use piercing weapons at all... not that there are manay to choose from for a paladin... atm, other than rp reasons, i can't see why pallys even get the skill<BR>---<P>ITEM: Lull spell line.<P>DESCRIPTION: People think this line of spells is too easily resisted and/or causes too much aggro. They claim to use it more for pulling than for anything else.<P>STATUS: None<P>NOTE: Heh almost every time i tried to use this spell line the mob aggrod directly on me and brought his buddies.  The druid/ranger spell Harmoy on the other had works far more often than it fails.  <BR>---<P>ITEM: Store bought lances.<P>DESCRIPTOIN: We should probably add these so that the knight classes can practice their piercing skill at the lower levels.<P>STATUS: None<P>NOTE: Unless you plan to increase the piercing cap, and make a greater variety of viable piercing weapons available, i wouldn't worry too much about this one.<BR>---<P>ITEM: White Armor and Shield.<P>DESCRIPTION: It would be nice if paladins in game could look like the one featured on our art, with the white shield and the white surcoat.<P>STATUS: None<P>NOTE:  ummm.... again... this is not a balance issue, and i know that personally i don't want to wear white armor at all, even though the velious plate for dwaves is white armor  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><BR>---<P>ITEM: New Discipline Idea.<P>DESCRIPTION: There is an interesting idea floating around for a discipline that would help make the paladin more useful on raids. It would allow the paladin to target a PC and, for the duration of the discipline, take half of the target’s damage in his stead. So if the target is hit for 100 points, the paladin would take 50 and the target would take 50. The restriction on this would be that the paladin had to remain within melee range of the target and that it would not stop AoE spells or environmental damage. The idea is that the paladin is throwing himself in the way to protect the target.<P>STATUS: None<P>NOTE: as stated above, the discipline would be awful.  usless in most cases to save a caster, and you really don't want to split damage between tanks 50/50 as it means that the cleric will have to initiate triage and decide which tank to CH.  I can see raid commanders specifically ordering that this discipline NOT be used.  I've seen some interesting alternative suggestions (pally takes 100% damage, pally lends ac/defensive skills, pally lends resists) and if they can be implemented, i think they should.  One of the traditional abilities of a paladin is their auras of protection.  As a discipline i'd have to vote for the pally takes 100% of damage/effect that would otherwise be taken by the caster route.  Call the discipline Sacrifice mebbe.  The auras of protection (group ac/resist/regen/whatever)  should prolly be spells that eat mana over time in the same manner as divine purpose, only spreading an effect over the whole group, or specifically group members in a certain radius from the paladin.<BR>---<P>ITEM: Deepwater Armor.<P>DESCRIPTION: They would like us to re-evaluate the effects on this set of armor.<P>STATUS: None<P>NOTE: Sounds like a good idea, but not what i'd call a major class balance issue.<BR>---<P>ITEM: Trueheart Shield and Theologian Claymore.<P>These items are found on the plane of Hate, yet have a basic graphic. It would be nice to make them look fancier.<P>STATUS: None<P>NOTE: Yet another issue that has nothing whatsoever to do with class balance.  My Darkmetal Holy Watersprinkler looks just like any other morning star.  So What?  If my ACGS looked like a rubber chicken instead of any other two handed sword it wouldn't make me like it any less, or make it any less useful....<BR>---<P>ITEM: Two-handed weapon minimum damage.<P>DESCRIPTION: How about making the minimum damage on two-handed weapons a little higher, perhaps based on the base damage of the weapon, to help bring up their popularity. After all, they should hit hard.<P>STATUS: None<P>NOTE: Not a class balance issue.  I know as many rangers and warriors that swing two-handed weapons as i know pallys that do.<BR>---<P>ITEM: Superior Healing fizzle.<P>DESCRIPTION: This spell fizzles a lot.<P>STATUS: None<P>NOTE: Sounds like a problem, but not one restricted to the paladin class.  My druid and shaman friends almost universally refer to this spell as superior fizzle, and some refuse to use it at all.  Something class related however seems to be the level we get the spell.  While i have no problem with being behind druids/shamans in getting this heal, if you reduce the level for them, it does seem appropriate now to lower the level when we get the spell as well.<P>---<P>ITEM: Offense<P>Description: Paladins fall FAR behind the other melee classes in terms of offense.  It has been noted that even a bard who has no double attack, but has dual wield can out damage a paladin with relative ease.  This has several negative effects.  It limits the effectiveness of a paladin's taunt ability.  It also reduces a paladin's desireability to a group.  What's the solution? well i can't pretend to know, but it certainly seems to bear looking into.<P>STATUS: not on Absor's list.<P>---<P>ITEM: Line of Stackable Spells<P>Description: Paladins seem to want a line of class defining buffs that will stack with the buffs of others.  One proposed solution was a line of protective auras. This fits with the traditional abilities of paladins in rp games.  The auras of protection (group ac/resist/regen/whatever)  should prolly be spells that eat mana over time in the same manner as divine purpose, only spreading an effect over the whole group, or specifically group members in a certain radius from the paladin.  This would go a LONG way towards paladins being desired as group members, and also on raids vs. uber mobs where resists are a must.<P>STATUS: not on Absor's list<P>---<P>ITEM: Weapon Selection<P>Description: Paladins seem to feel that there are just not enough weapons out there to help narrow the gap between a paladin and the dual wielding classes, and that those that are out there are just far too rare to obtain.<P>STATUS: not on Absor's list.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think the LH should be a group heal and time to recast should be lowered as you level up.  I think a pally should be able to rez at lower levels making them wanted also.  They idea of a stackable buffs would be nice also.  These three items would be simple to add and would make getting into groups much easier. Level 40 groups dont like Palidins either believe me. Giving us all of the above items we would never replace the Cleric or the Warrior which seems to be the big fear.  We would help in rezing, and help make the tanks stronger for battle this by no means would hurt a cleric or a warrior it would only help them.<P><BR>Please take this into consideration.<BR>I keep hearing past 50 talk how the pally is not wanted for grouping.  My only char is a lvl 40 pally that is all ready running into that problem.  I was leading a group in Solu B window room last night keeping the waiting list and keeping our group balanced.  I would ask the group everytime who they wanted out of the top ones on the list in five hours of leading the group we took no Pallys. Not that you only need one pally in a group but to all the other players you never need one, but I was the one leading so I guess that makes me be able to stay.  This is bad as a pally group leader I couldn't ever see where a pally was gonna be a real assest to our group.  If I can't see why our group needed a paladin why would another type of player ever pick one.<P>I have not been playing as long as most people playing EQ I'm sure maybe things have changed since you worked your way up through the levels. I dont have supper tweak items spent a lot of money and time in Smithing I wear armor I have made, which is Fine Plate.  I have almost finished my Ro Armor Quests I have all the stuff and can make ronium.  I did not kill gnomes as they are a freindly race I bought the Melatite.  I did kill the fairies which i think was probably not what a real Palidin should do but face it at lvl 40 they are green and I could not find enough fairy dust to buy.  But have yet to get any molds but will in the next week or so.  The big problem I see with Ro is i could have bought armor that was better by now than Ro.  But I like the idea of making my own armor and questing for it.  <P>I could move all my stuff over to a warrior become twink run through the levels faster and be sought after in every group.  But instead I will continue down the path of a Palidin no matter how disadvantaged it is if in the end when I pass level 50 no one will fight with me it will be the end of my EQ days.  I may be looking at this wrong but can't believe that you work hard for 50 levels to find out that is the best you can do becuase of they class you picked.<P>Binafus <BR>Champions of Brell<BR>Paladin of the 40th season<BR>Bertoxxulous <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I have been on over half a dozen Fear raids seeing not one piece of Valorium drop; half of those times not one male FF spawned. Please re-evaluate the spawn % of Male vs Female FFs in Fear and/or allow a certain % of Valorium to drop on both females and males.<P>Casting on lower level characters:<BR>It seems that some of the hybrid spells can't be cast on lower level characters because they are post 50th level spells for the hybrid. But these spells are actually lower level spells for their parent class, and the parent class can cast them on lower level characters.<P>Deffensive skills:<BR>Dodge, parry, reposte upgrades I noticed on Test, but please include Deffense as well.<P>Bash:<BR>Please do not allow the attack round of bash to be used when you "can not see your target" or "you are too far away".

</FONT><HR>HYBRIDS ARE THE FALLACY!<P>ABSOR, do you realize we are currently the SIXTH best melee class in the game??  SIXTH!!! Monks, Rogues, Rangers, Warriors, and Shadow Knights out damage us. Most of them SIGNIFICANTLY out damage us!! We are not even close. More in line with Clerics....<P>We are also the FOURTH best healer in the game!! FOURTH!! Clerics, Shaman and the all-powerful do everything Druids out heal us...and not just out heal us...I mean it's not even CLOSE!! We are WAY behind.<P>We are not even the best at DEFENSE which is supposed to be our "defining" role as a "defensive tank"!  We may every well be THIRD in defense behind Warriors and Monks!!<P>Why on EARTH would anyone want the 6th best at melee ability and the 4th best at healing and the 3rd best at Defense in ANY group? WHY??? It's simple. THEY DON'T!!! Easy as that. <P>And it all makes perfect sense. If I wasn't a Paladin, I wouldn't want me either!! We only get groups as a last resort. That's it. We are akin to the kid on the playground who really wants to play but the team to pick last HAS to taken him. NO ONE wants us, it's just sometimes they have to take us. Sad really...when you consider we are supposed to be proud noble warriors who lead by example!<P>Hmmmmm....looks like I have wasted months and lots of hard work, only to slowly move myself closer to extinction with each kill. Such a shame too. I enjoyed my Paladin, but can't see any reason to continue an exercise in futility. It will be much less fun to play knowing that with each victory I move closer to losing and soon will be obsolete. <P>Must be time to start a monk or a rogue.....at least I have a defining role and can continue to improve instead of becoming LESS effective as I gain experience. I have read the other class talks. I don't see players saying "time to retire" or "I have already retired" or "I guess I have to quit".  We are the only ones. TAKE THE HINT VERANT! SOMETHING IS WRONG!<P>I agree with an earlier post. The fact that "Hybrids" are here at all is where the true fallacy lies.  Verant just threw together the Hybrids using skills already present in our "parent" classes.  They gave us nothing new, just something other players already had...and they gave it to us in a much MUCH diluted form. Nothing special in anyway. Vastly inferior in most ways. NO DEFINITION WHAT SO EVER!<P>Without defining skills and abilities, we have no chance because we will always be infringing on our parent classes and Verant can't let that happen. We are painted into a corner with no way out.<P>There is an old proverb that says it's never too late to turn from the wrong path...(paraphrased). Unfortunately, Verant is making the Players turn to other characters instead of fixing the real problem themselves. We should not be Hybrids. We are Holy Knights. But the way Verant has it, we will ALWAYS ALWAYS be second best....or, in the case of melee, 6th best...or in the case of healing 4th best or in the case of defense 3rd best. We aren't even the BEST at our defining skill of DEFENSE!!!

</FONT><HR>The thing is with Paladins is no where will you find an occasion where someone will say Oh WE NEED a paladin for this or a Paladin will do great here and so on ...you WILL ALWAYS find an occasion where they will say WE NEED an enchanter here or a warrior and a rogue and cleric and so on....<BR>   Perfect example was this weekend when i got a tell while i was in no ro and the person was in sebillis...they couldnt find any tanks so they said they FINALLY went through the paladin list and asked me...if its not my friends i usually dont get random tells for groups.. The thing that bothered me was they looked for every other type of so called "tank" before they ended up with paladins....<P>Thats where the fix has to be made....we cant be a last resort class anymore<P><BR>Italadin Portaluce<BR>56 Knight<BR>Bristlebane<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I dunno if this has been mentioned yet, but as it was discussed, and promised to be fixed asap, in the HoC chat a while back I thought it would be wise to remind ya.<P>The HELM BUG for Erudite paladins, our helm still takes the colour of our gloves, and therefore we dont have any real helm graphics. <P>I know its a minor thing, but it was promised to be fixed early in beta and in the HoC chat were you participated.<P>Aask</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
