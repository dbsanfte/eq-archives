</FONT><HR>Well I switched from a Lvl 12 Wizard to a WoodElf Druid and I am very happy with the change so far.  I would like to be able to look forward to some spells like Ring of Rowen which allows you to turn your group into a Ring of Rowen trees when the battle has turned south.  It would only work outside. It would last for only 2 minutes and act like a zone when it came to hate factor.<P>So if your battle is too close to the MOB when the spell wore off it could re-aggro on the group but if you were far enough away when the spell wore off you could quietly retreat, regroup, and go back for more.  <P>Of course while you are a tree you can't fight or cast spells but your health would regen as if you were sitting and resting.  And if any of your team died in the area then this would keep the MOB slightly interested in your group kinda like saying "UGH where did smelly good guys go?"  <P>Maybe this would be a quest or research type spell for a mid level Druid.<P>And spirit of the Eagle would be good, kind of a combination of Levitate and SoW.<P>What I think about character classes is this they are all pretty good each with their advantages and disadvantages.  This concept always seems to get lost in the scheme of things.  Sure being superman would be fun until you nullified every bad guy there ever was.  Then it would be boring.  <P>I believe that there is great value in soloing and it should be applauded.  There is always safety in numbers but it should be possible to travel the whole of norrath and explore without too much penalty.  I mean if you use good common sense as you would probably do in the real world you should stay fairly safe.  This really isn't the case though and that is too bad.  <P>If any class is soloing and trying to hunt alone are they being selfish or are they unable to find a group.  I had alot of trouble grouping as a Wizard even at lvl 12.  Everyone wants tanks and healers.  Wizards are probably very good at high levels and probably find groups easily.  But my experience with groups is very poor.  I am now in a 3 person group most of the time. Still I find it difficult to get others to join in.  So I believe that life in Norrath should be less dependent on groups and more dependent on actions.<P>But that isn't how this game is played so I do what I must to eek out a living in Norrath.<P>Druids, Monks, and Wizards are my favorites.<BR>Good Hunting </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"For the Scale line, how about it not overwriting sow, so that when it drops because you were attacked it still drops, but sow remains giving you a chance to escape. (Not counting the sow speed mobs, of course)" -ascii<P>It would solve the problem of people wanting the, presumably, more expensive SoW2 as well.  Making SoW2 castable indoors, with no speed increase over SoW, in conjunction with the above "Scale Line" proposal would seem to benefit the class in a way that is not to unbalancing.  Being able to SoW indoors would also give us a nich in high level dungeon encounters.<P>Dunneldeen Gaillionne, druid of saryrn.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Grrrr!  Fluff.  I'm a lvl 40 druid, and have travelled with the same group since I was level 10.  I have noticed only a couple things that would make me more group friendy...even now. <BR> <BR>Main reason I'm "needed" is for ports and snare.  When our cleric is not on, I have to play healer, and with Velious mobs hitting for more than the Kunark mobs, ouch<P>Greater healing just does not cut it, even at level 40.  And I don't get another until post 50!? Eeeep!  I'm reduced to healing the healer if it get's aggro'd on, or healing the chanter when ONE of her spells outweighs the aggro of a snare/dot combo.  Healing our tanks is just starting to get foolish, I have to chain cast in Velious!<P>Grrrr, I'm just SICK of looking for Ro's Fiery Sundering.  Some said Garou has a CHANCE to drop it, and since he has the skin I want for the club quest, O'tay!  Sooo, after a week, haven't seen a Garou, and have found out his drops of spells are random/rare as is the skin.  Next is, Guardian Wurms drops spells, O'tay!  Went there with my group, hrm...don't think it's truely possible to hold the room without two groups AT MY LEVEL. <P>Put it this way, RANDOM spell drops from CAMPED or VERY RARE spawns is just frustrating.  I don't want to be level 50+ before I get ONE of my Velious dropped spells.  <P>Summary:  <P>Already getting hard to even be supplemental healer at level 40, considering mob damage has increased in Kunark, and now, even more in Velious.<P>Yay! Got a DD at level 34! (That's also a stun so gets resisted goodly)  Booo, got my level 39 DD and it's more mana efficient to cast careless lightning over and over again.  BUT!!!  Ro's Fiery Sundering?! My answer!?  No, MY HELL.  I refuse to spend all my waking hours to find this one spell, that will make it a lot easier to land my fire DD and DoT.  That's simply NOT how I wish to spend 3/4ths of my online time.<P>GRRRR!  Forget the fluff!  I DON'T want to solo!  I DO want to be with my group, AND be able to be effective.<P>Saduj Proditor<BR>Druid to the 40th Power<BR>Blazing Monolith of Defiance<BR>Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If this is the "definitive" list then I guess I am a little dissapointed appreciative of any change that would make us more desirable in groups at 50+.<P>ITEM: Healing.<P>This is the only area where that your propsed changes make any real difference to me  Fortunately, it was the only area I really cared about as I am a Healing/Grouping Druid.<P>This is my request.  At the end of your balacing act, please make certain that 2 Druids OR 2 Shamen OR 1 Druid and 1 Shaman have the same power to heal as ONE Cleric.  So that means you need to watch out how Druid healing and Shaman healing are going to stack.<P>ITEM: Charm Animals.<P>I don't care if you do anything to this.  Except for a couple of specialty zones, I don't use this spell.<P>ITEM: New Druid Rings.<P>While I would like this, I don't see it as being a Balance Issue ... you don't get invited into groups because you can port someone somewhere.  Now I do think you should do it just as a convenience to the Players (not just Druids).  More casual gamers will stick with you when the next neat game comes out if you make the game friendlier to them.  Oh, and whatever you do in this regard for Druids, do for Wizards too.<P>ITEM: Spirit of Wolf – II.<P>I'd take it, but I don't care since I don't kite anyway (well, not much  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> )  i agree with another poster with a name remarkedly like my own, it would be better just to make Spirit of the Cheetah useful again.  When you "fixed" it awhile back, I moved it to the back of my spell book and haven't used it since.  BTW, thank you again for letting us move our spells around.  I know everyone takes that for granted now days, but I still appreciate it.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>ITEM: New Appearances.<P>Irrelevant to Balance.<P>ITEM: Vermiculated Armor.<P>Irrelevant to Balance.<P>ITEM: Elder Spiritist Boots.<P>Irrelevant to Balance.<P>ITEM: Quad Kiting.<P>I think Quad kiting is a bad thing for one reason and one reason only.... it makes everyother class and his brother too damn JEALOUS of Druids.  It also acts a Mob horder since the Druid is occupying four Mobs at the same time for a good bit of time.  It just pisses the other players off.  So, just take it away.  Please do NOT mess with Snare as that would HURT our function in a group.  Just take away our Lightning Blasts and replace them with some GOOD rains that could not be used while Kiting.  Alternatively, you could put a +or- 5% into the Snare spell so that mobs would move at SLIGHTLY different speeds.<P><BR>ITEM: Emotes for Wolf Form.<P>Irrelevant to Balance.<P>ITEM: The 55th level pet.<P>Irrelevant to Balance.<P>ITEM: Succor and Egress.<P>Yes, this should be fixed.  IMO, it's pretty damn stupid that you'd be placed on someone's hate list just because you are under the effect of an offensive spell (the real complaint here is that Gonaire can be amiable to you but she aggros on you and kills you if you are accidently caught in a AOE).<P>ITEM: Tunare’s Request.<P>No opinion.<P><BR>ITEM: Fizzling Spells.<P>YES.  Fix Fizzling!  Applies to all casters.  If you have a spell, you should be able to rely on it pretty well, especially after the level that you got it.<P><BR>ITEM: Beguile Plants.<P>Irrelevant to Balance.<P>ITEM: Scale of Wolf and Spirit of Scale.<P>Irrelevant to Balance.  I use these for the exact same thing I used to use Spirit of Cheetah for.... the long run in West Karana... and that's it.  Is that all you wanted us to have it for?<P>ITEM: Ro’s Fiery Sundering.<P>Irrelevant to Balance.<P><BR>Finally, please remove the Kunark Dungeon restriction from Winds.... or put in a slower casting spell that goes the same places without the restriction.<P>Thanks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>/sigh<P>Less fizzle would be nice, but we are still useless to raids on the big mobs.  <P>Everything resists our nukes.  Noone trust DoTs, so we can't use them if more than one group is involved for fear the mob will poof.  Noone wants our buffs, since other classes are better.  And we still can't heal fast enough or enough hp to be of use as healers.  So this list has done nothing to make us more group friendly for the end game mobs.<P>That is assuming that we can actually get our drop spells, that we have to be 2 or 3 levels higher than the spell to get a chance that they will drop during an exp group.  As far as I am concern none of the spells should be dropped, maybe quested for, but would have to be doable for a druid of that level and not require the backing of an uber guild to do.  Yes trak or that turtle may drop a 60 lvl spell, but why are the big mobs needed to drop what is our reward for gaining a new level?  Its not like we can resale the spells when they become obsolete.<P>And yes I have had the pleasure of being on an open trak raid that took that dragon down (it was the first time an open raid was tried on my server, naggy and vox style).  And tried each type of dd spell that I had and nothing stuck.  And only made him mad at me for some reason.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  I felt totally useless on the Trak part of the raid.  I did blast a bunch of stuff getting to trak and help a little with heals.  But for all the good I did against Trak, I would have been better off staying in the cubby hole and waiting for the battle to finish.  How boring!!!  Atleast then Trak wouldn't have killed me for being silly enough to try and nuke him.  Heal during the battle you say.  Hehehehe, I tried, but didn't do any good fizzle, fizzle, fizzle, oh about 5 of them then the tanks were died, then me.<P>So what is it druids do on the boss mobs?  Sit in a corner and stay out of the way like with VS?   How boring!!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

And honestly that will just make us even more of a taxi service then we are now. Better heal spells would be a plus but isnt it a bit late to change this now?

</FONT><HR>There are quite a few good ideas in this last series of Class Talk (Druid) postings.  ABSOR's "final list" ignores nearly all of the really needed changes and additions.  I'm sure Druids will now be in great demand by groups for the enhanced doggy tricks we'll be able to perform.

</FONT><HR>I've looked over the list of changes and read the, up to now, four pages of comments made. I agree with many. I believe that many problems have been recognized, but no real useful solutions created.<BR>I understand that in order to keep the gameplay fair for all classes that there must be limitations, but as many have said I see no point in creating a line of spells that practically no Druids use due to their practical uselessness. <BR>I only have one character and that is a druid named Kurran on the Bertox server. I've come to the conclusion that druids are ok at just about everything, but really good at just about nothing. We need need something, like Windburn says on page one of these postings, that makes us "UNIQUE." I bring nothing to the game that some other class couldn't bring. I love the idea of making the pet charm/befriend spells an ability instead of a spell. Make it possible for Druids to simply ask an animal, that roleplay-wise makes sense, to join them. The animal can either join or not depending on your ability rating. I thought it was awesome when I first started playing and found out I would get the ability to have a pet, but I soon learned that it was merely something thrown in of little to no use. I wouldn't mind having to wait til even lvl 40 or even 50, heck give it to me as a grand reward when I reach lvl 60, but make it useful to me. Don't give me a spell somewhere in the 50's that only allows me to charm pets in the 30's. That just gives me the ability to power level others. Just give me the ability to charm creatures within a couple levels of myself and I'll be happy. If you want to add the drawback that they must con friendly or amiably then the other druid factors of being a treehugger will factor in automatically. Make it outdoors only if you want and maybe another slight drawback like a lower attack strength because it is no longer wild. Whatever you decide, either get rid of it completely or fix it so that it is worth having.<BR>I love my class, I enjoy my character and the only really annoying thing that I've seen thus far is the futility of the charm spells. Just want to thank everyone who contributed to make such a sweet game.<P>-Kurran</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

post.<P>From a BALANCE point of view the druid class has absolutely no problems as a solo class or as a group class until somewhere in the 40s.<P>After this point in a druids life it starts to get increasingly difficult to get groups.<P>We cant get in as damage dealers because a druid deals less damage than just about any other class in a high level group, apart from clerics, enchanters and bards which all have their clear roles in a group.<P>We cant get in a buffers because clerics, shamans and mages can do any one of our buffs earlier/better.<P>We cant get in as healers because a cleric is more or less needed and suddently preferred in any high level group and because shamans are the preferred secondary healer class if any is accepted.<P>The ONLY important change on this list, is the socalled healing improvement of druids and of course I fully support that. But lets face it. Moving Superior heal from 53 to 51 only helps druids that are level 51 or 52. It is no significant overall improvement of the druid class.<P>More importantly the suggestion is to improve the healing of shamans and druids equally, and if this is the way it stays NOTHING WILL CHANGE.<P>Druids will still only get a primary healer role if no cleric and no shaman can be found. And they will still only get a secondary healer role if no shaman can be found and the group really need 2 healers. Translated into real EQ play this means that druids will (still) only very rarely be accepted into good groups.<P>Dont deny the obvious. Our primary competition are the shamans:<P>Lets compare the classes:<P>SoW     Equal<BR>DoTs    Equal<BR>DD      Druid  +<BR>Heals   Equal/Shaman + (gets some spells earlier)<BR>Pet     Shaman ++<BR>Buffs   Shaman +++<BR>Slow    Shaman +++<BR>Meele   Shaman +<BR>AC      Shaman ++<BR>Mana    Shaman +++ (can trade health for mana and regen themselves)<BR>Snare   Druid  +++<BR>Root    Shaman +<P>This obvious imbalance is what faces high level druids. And this imbalance is not adressed at all even if every single change suggested on the above list is carried out.<P>SUGGESTIONS:<P>1. Make druids the second best healing class so that druids and not shamans would be best suited to fill in for a cleric.<P>or<P>2. Improve druid damage output. Most logical way would be to give druids much better group  dmg shields. Why after all should mages get the best pet in the game AND the best damage shield?<P>or<P>Give druids an earlier self only way to mana regen that is more than just token size.<P>                  --- o ---<P>If the prize for a real role in groups for a post 50 druid is nerfing quad kiting then by all means do so. Just do it in a way that does not affect our one good spell ... snare.<P>Anyway I am afraid it is to late. Our need for REAL improvement in our group role will be overlooked again because people are seing soloing druids and thinking the class must be overpowered.<P>I am sad to say I started a cleric and a shaman so on second thought ... leave druids as they are :P<P>Respectfully<P>Bari Eagleeye</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Speaking from a cleric's point of view, the only options I see being posted here to make druids more valuable in groups is to increase their healing abilities.  Druids already have many advantages overall and have some excellent group skills as well.  This does not mean that I do not think they should have some changes made to them that will make them more desireable in groups.  Granted, I have not read through every single post so I may have missed a suggestion or two.  <BR>     <BR>Druids and shamans both SHOULD have the current increases listed on the test server.  SH at 51 is a good move, even to 49 would not be unbalancing.  A spell similar to Remedy at 55 is ok and then a spell that heals around 900 or so for BOTH druids and shamans at 59 or 60 would work as well.  That should be the cap on the heals for those two classes.   Why? Because that leaves clerics with one heal spell that is better and that is Complete Healing.  This is a situational spell at best and not used as much as many people seem to think it is.  Most clerics use Remedy and Divine Light or Celestial Healing/Elixir in most group fights for the simple fact that 10 seconds cast time on CH means many dead group members if you are not careful.  Clerics do one thing extremely well, and that is heal.  If we are creative, we can do a few more things but for the vast majority it is truly med/heal/med/heal etc.  Diluting that more could have an impact on clerics in higher level groups.<P>Please do not take all this as a rant.  Just trying to explain a cleric's perspective on the healing issue.  No one should be close to a cleric in terms of healing.  At the same time, clerics should not be absolutely neccessary for a group to form in a normal circumstance.  What I mean by this, is that in Karnors Castle, any group should be able to hunt with any reasonable combination and able to hunt well in most places of the dungeon like the hand room or warlord etc.  A cleric should not be required to hunt in most areas of the zone.<P>     To this end, I think that druids should be given a capability that makes them desired in groups AND reduces the need for healing at such levels that requires a cleric.  Druids right now are considered the second best at just about every role but have no specific role to call their own.  Why not give them a role that is unique and complimentary to other classes without giving away other classes' abilities to make them more desireable in groups?  Why not give druids a spell at higher levels similar but complimentary to the shaman slow series of spells. Call it entangle like the old AD&D series of spells. I am not an expert on what exactly the shaman slow spell does so bear with me on this; and I am not familiar with all high level druid spells either but I don't think they have anything currently like what I am thinking of below.<P>Spell: Engtangling roots (or some other nature name).  Roleplaying aspect is that the spell causes vines to grow from the ground tangling up a monsters arms and feet thereby reducing their ability to fight.<P>The actual effect of the spell would be that it lowers the target's overall ac by a percentage instead of an actual numeric value.  This enhances the meleers'capabilities in having higher damage.  Even more important overall though, would be the spell having some sort of effect that could help reduce the mob damage output.  I think the shaman slow spells increase the delay between the actual mob attacks.  For example, if a mob hits every 3 seconds and is slowed it now hits once every 6 seconds or so.  Why not make the druid spell do something similar, but instead, it reduces the actual number of attacks in an individual round?  If a mob qaud hits, then this could reduce it to 2 hits or in some circumstances to a single hit. <BR>Make it stackable to the shaman slow spells but reduce the effectiveness of both if they are both on the same mob for balance purposes.  Test the ratios to make them work but this would reduce the damage a monster does in a round of combat where it should be sufficient for a druid or shaman to act as a healer WITHOUT making them into clerics at the higher levels.  It adds a role for them in a group that is unique and compliments other classes' roles. And if I am describing the shaman slow spells when I refer to reducing the number of actual hits per round, then make the druid spell increase the time between attacks.  Make the higher level spell reduce attacks by 50% or 75% if it isn't too overpowering.  That would definitely make a druid desireable in a lot of groups and it wouldn't really effect their ability to solo since kiting really does not involve getting hit.  Make the mana cost somewhat high to offset the advanatgaes of damage.  350 or 400 (similar to complete heal cost).<P>     Another issue I did not see really addressed here, was the high end raids and the role, or lack thereof, druids (or shamans) play on them.   Currently, one shaman is usually all that comes on a raid since only one can actually cast slow on a mob.  Others are mainly backup healers.  Druids, well they seem to be there for ports out at the end of the raid more than anything else or healing casters.  And I am not trying to flame either class, just trying to address the issue of how they are seen for higher raids.  They SHOULD have a role and an important one like other classes do.   Have a "raid" version of the slow spells for both shamans and druids.  Make them stackable. The more druids and shamans, the more cumalitive effect of the slow spells.  Cap it at 40% or 30% or whatever.  Say each druid that casts the raid version slows the mob 5%. Same for shaman.  The more of each class you have, the better chance of slowing the boss mob even more.  And on the high end Velious mobs, that would definitely have an important effect and help out all raid members.  I don't think raids should boil down to 1 or 2 enchanters, 15 warriors, 6 rogues, and 5 clerics.  <BR>Heck, add a curse series for necormancers that might reduce the effectiveness of how well a mob hits.   Maybe make it miss 20% of the time.  That adds something to them for grouping but doesn' take away from other classes. <P>These are just my two cents worth.  Verant asked a while back for ways to make other solo oriented classes more group friendly without stepping too much into the realms of other classes.  The argument that druids and shamans need even better heals to keep groups alive because there are few clerics is not really addressing the problem.  Why not give you the role and tools to be creative and reduce the damage dealt to within the  current capabilities you have to be able to heal the group.  It won't be as efficient healing as a cleric but it also shoudln't take all your mana to do it.  Just an idea for balance that will add a new dimension to druids and make them more group friendly without making them mini-clerics.<BR>Also, give druids and shamans a group spell buff that cast the equivalent of the resist line of spells (adds 40 resist) but that covers cold, fire, poision, and disease all in one shot? There are better group spells for a single resist like GRM and the druid circle of winter spells, but this would be a general purpose elemental buff.  Just an idea for balance. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm not a druid, infact I'm a Paladin, but I regularly group with one and I think this is a very good idea. So I'm reposting it to keep it read because post new posters don't usually read over old posts and this needs support.<P>**************************************************<BR>ok, I would like to reiterate that there is another option to fixing the charm concerns. Which is COMPLETELY removing the line and inplace make a charm SKILL. This skill could either be like LoH\HT or it could be like Mend. Both have advantages and disadvantages that the Dev Team could pound out.<BR>One of the reasons druids don't like the charm line is that we dont feel animals should aggro on you after charm drops for roleplay reasons. You, Verant, feel it would be a gameplay problem for them not to do so. Additionally, our spells shouldn't be forcing an animal into submission though magic (such as the enchanter would) but "befriending" it. Thus the skill come in. If an animal is befriended it will stay your "pet" (either controlable or not) until either you die\zone or it dies. The "charm" won't wear off therefor you, Verant, do not have to concern yourselves with the balance issues of that, only the reset time on such a skill. Finally this would make druids unique!! I CAN'T stress this enough....it will make us UNIQUE!! Which is something our class desperately needs.<BR>Now, this isn't a flawless idea. There are just as many cons as there are pros. All I ask is that it be added to the list to be brought up and suggested.<BR>thankyou<BR>Druids: PLEASE SUPPORT THIS IDEA!!<P>Amarok Windburn<BR>Druid of Tunare<BR>40th season<BR>Heroes of the Avatar<BR>Tallon Zek<BR>**************************************************<P>Selanar Truthseeker<BR>Paladin of Tunare<BR>Norrathian Protectors<BR>Tallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree that this final edit of our list does nothing to improve our grouping abilities, nor does it really reflect the "draft" that was posted.<P>I currently play a lvl 45 druid (amongst other classes) and am already finding it difficult enough to get into a group .... hate to think what post-50 is gonna be like... <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>Possibly the most outstanding idea I have seen posted here is the idea of "Windburn" who suggested making our charm animals a SKILL instead of a SPELL.  Windburn this is a great, original idea which should definitely be taken into serious consideration by VI.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cool.gif"><P>The other things that make sense - although do little to improve the "need" for druids in a group is a ring in Surefall as it is one of our starting cities, as is GFay/Kelethin. Also the need for "rings" to be placed into these zones is not absolutely necessary.. there aren't any rings in Skyfire or EJ's are there? and they are not our home towns!<P>Another opinion of mine, and remember they are only my thoughts to improve the grouping abilities of us druids, is to give us an AoE snare similar to the wizzies though perhaps change it a little to say.. half the snare time with an added "slow" effect??<P>imo if we are given a SOW II which I doubt will ever happen... it should be similar to the "clarity II" given it's limitations as to the level of player it can be cast on. This would greatly improve the desirability of grouping in higher levels and also stop the lower level beggars hassling us for it... you don't see a newbie asking for a Clarity II very often, unless they are true "newbies" and don't know the limitations...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif"><P>The only other thing I can think of to improve grouping desirability is to make a "sow" or a "wolf-form" (mouse form, bird form, bear form... whatever...) that increases movement rates indoors... Why can NPCs cast movement spells indoors and druids can't?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>As for the rest of the silly requests that I had not seen previously posted before here... wolf-emotes  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/confused.gif"> .... such a waste of effort considering all the other GREAT ideas that have been tossed around on these boards over the past couple of weeks...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>Please consider a few of the more reasonable ones to make us more desirable to groups lvl 44+...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Already the cleric has been cheapened with 2 other classes having rez, there really is NO excuse or reason for a third.<P>People constantly complain about the number of clerics in the game and use this as an excuse to ask for better and bigger heals, but surely the sane here can see that this is a fool's path? Instead of improving an already flexible and DESIRABLE class (check the number of people who play them, something MUST be right...) to cover the lack of clerics, how about improving the cleric so more want to play them? No? Thought so.<P>Druids should be enhanced to function at 50+, I agree, but bigger heals earlier is a stoopid way to go, from my viewpoint at least. At this rate, there will NO L50+ clerics being played, and they will have to give you all Cheal, or is that the plan?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>All those proposed changes are nice but you forgot one BIG issue.  The big uper mob fight.  The other day my guild went out and killed the dragon in emeral jungle, skyfire,and wakinglands.  We had a lack of wizards on that night and it put more pressure on the druids in my guild to nuke more.  On all 3 dragon I wasn't able to do more then 500 hp worth of damage casting 3 to 5 dagamge spells on them, even after tash and mala which drop all resist.  The reason I belive on these encounters as with the many other uper mobs such as gods that druids should nuke is becasue our sup heal doens't do anything to a dragon that quad hits for 500.  The fact is our healling and nuking capabilities on these encounters are a JOKE.  Not a very funny one.  I am tired of felling worthless on these raids and am about to quit playing my druid and concent trate on pling a character that can acctually contribute something on big raids other than teleports.

</FONT><HR>Ok, I see a lot of good suggestion, but few of them fix the problems.  I agree with the changes to heal, but the MAIN problem is that our class mandate is broken.  We're travelers.  According to EQ's definition, nobody is better at getting from point A to point B.  The problem is...<P>1) Wizzies can TP even better, and are #1 at nuking.<P>2) Shammies can SOW, and are #1 to #2 at buffing.<P>So, if a group takes a wizzie for nukes, and a shammie for buffs, they have NO need of a Druid.<P>Even if this weren't true, travelling will only get us into groups long enough to tp them.  Once they're there, they have no use for us.  Travelling is useful for PREPARING for an adventure, not for adventuring itself.<P>I think the solution is to change or add travel spells to give us back our mandate, and make us useful in an adventure again.<P>Give us a chance with improved camo spells that work even against "see invisible".  One of our upper level Wolf Forms should make almost everything non-agro, but Drop if we attack anything.  The idea is to give us a chance to travel through dangerous zones even at upper levels.<P>Then, the thing that will REALLY make us popular in groups...  Give us a "group-summoning" spell.  That would allow us to sneak through the zone, find a reasonably safe spot, and summon our group to us.<P>I'm sure there will have to be restrictions...  Not allowed between zones, or requires 100% of your mana, or any of a number of other things.<P>What it WILL do it make us wanted in groups, while at the same time giving us back our mantle as master travelers.<P>Gaellic</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi all,<BR>  I've been playing my (now 31) druid for about 6 months now. Yes, I know he should be higher by now  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">. Anyway, here are my thoughts on things brought up on the list. These are my "druid pet peeves":<P>1) Spirit of cheetah. I love it but I don't like the time it takes to become active in your spell list. TEN MINUTES? Get real. If you want to have a long gap between castings, fine, but don't make it a ten minute wait for it to become available! Also, can't it last a little longer? I use it to run across zones (Karana!!) and it would be nice to have it last.<P>2) Two more druid entry points: Surefall Glade! The Karana run is disgusting and I don't understand why we have to do it. It's tedious and almost insulting to the player that they have to run across this ridiculous zone just to get to Qeynos. Also, I created a new Wiz this weekend and happened across an unused druid ring in GFay. Making this active would be nice, but not required since the run from BB isn't that bad.<P>3) Charm animal: if someone made me spack gnolls around I'd be pissed too!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">. How about this instead - don't let the pet go aggro on the caster unless it's hurt. That would make more sense, no?<P>4) Self-only Velious TP at 29! Why the wait to 34 only to get a group spell?<P>5) I agree with the problems of looking like a damn newbie! I'm 31 and I look the same as I did when I was 8. Please make some new respectable texures.<P>Mike<BR>Talisaar - Level 31 druid - Xegony<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Please, if you add more ports, DON'T put them in either of the Faydarks.  We already have two port destinations on Faydwer; Butcherblock and Steamfont.  I can run from Butcherblock to Steamfont in about 5 minutes as it is... why would I need to port into either of the Faydarks?<P>Certainly, please let us port into Surefall (or even the haunted druid ring in Qeynos Hills).  It's ridiculous to have to run from North or West Karana, or take a boat from Toxxulia, especially when you consider that we have 3 port/evac destinations within two minutes of each other: WK, NK and EK.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>hello i do not play a druid or wizard.from a travel stand point it sucks when it take 1 hour and a half to get your forces somewhere in the game.you are trying to cutt downtime which is great,try cutting set up time and give the wizards and druid more travel spells please.if you cant give them more how about modifying some of the some of the ones already in game.example make the emerald jungle and skyfire evacs castable from anywhere not just kunark dungeons,or you could give them a new spell that is just a group gate spell for those 2 spots that works anywhere that way they still ahve the fast casting evac too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Thanks to those few that have expressed their views with regards to the issue of Druids and their inability to heal.  SoW II, the newbie look, charm animals, port locations, the pet...none of those make the Druid as ineffective as the issue of healing, which is written in our bio.  When we don't get into a group, it isn't because of any of those things.  Most gameplayers do not even realize we are blasters, I often have to tell them that to get into groups.  Druids are more often sought for their ability to heal, or be back-up healers which disappears at level 39.  <P>Because of all of the other requests, EQ has given no serious credence to the issue of healing.  The petition submitted calls for Superior Healing to be moved to 44 or 49.  EQ has somehow acknowledged receipt of a request for a move from 53 to 51.  It should actually be moved to 39 because this brings it into line with following one spell cycle behind the Cleric.  In addition, we should receive increases in healing hitpoints at 49 and at later a later level that comencerates with the increase in hitpoints of the melee classes and why not give us Complete Healing at 58 or so.. we ARE healers.  We didn't make it up, EQ did.  And no, I am not trying to be a Cleric with my Druid.  <P>Let me give you an example:  During game play last night in Dreadlands, I was grouped with a Cleric, Shaman, Magician, Ranger and 2 Warriors (an Ogre and a Barbarian).  The only one of us that could heal the Ogre was the Cleric.  When the Cleric left, the Shaman and myself both had to become healers and we still couldn't quite keep up the healing.  In the meanwhile, we were shouting for a Cleric.  This is ridiculous.  And to think that this is going to go on until I am level 51 or 53 is totally absurd.<P>It is also ridiculous to suggest that a group always have a Shaman and a Druid to make up for a Cleric.  Who's to say that this is always possible.  In addition, in a group setting, Druids and Shamans have other attributes to offer other than solely dedicating their time to healing..just like other classes.  Increasing our healing will not make us Cleric, or make Clerics any less desirable.  Clerics will always have a place because of the summoning line and their buffs.  Personally, I think its only fitting that our buffs don't stack with the Clerics because they are at the forefront of the Priestly classes.  <P>Please do not mistake me for saying that some or all of the other items shouldn't be on a wish list.  I am simply hardpressed to complain about port locations, or what I am wearing when during game play when I can't keep a player alive.  The issue of healing is the one that directly affects our game play.  <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000393-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000393.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000393-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000393-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000393-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum14&number=14&thisthread=000393&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum14&number=14&thisthread=000393&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
