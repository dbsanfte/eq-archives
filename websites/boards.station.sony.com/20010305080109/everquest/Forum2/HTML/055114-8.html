</FONT><HR>My name is Phalladar Le`Voleur and I'm a level 54 Rake from Lanys T'Vyl.<P>I haven't read every post, but I've read quite a number of them... and sorry if I repeat suggestions, as I'm sure I will... but I might as well affirm them anyway.<P>DAMAGE OUTPUT: <BR>We are the melee masters, I know this, you know this, and everyone that has ever grouped with us post 50 knows this. No need to adjust anything here.<P>DEFENSE: <BR>Currently, I have around 900 self-buffed (go turtle booties!) AC... and about 1550 hit points. Buffed in a group, I do tend to take a lot of damage, but it's nothing that isn't easily negated by a good cleric. IMO nothing to change here either. <P>HIDE: <BR>I'm pleasantly surprised by the changes in HIDE post 50... stuff that used to see us doesn't anymore, and I think that's pretty neat. However, I do think,<BR> a.) We should be able to stay hide/sneaking when we travel through zone lines. It may be a coding issue where they can't leave a hotkey operational where you zone, but if this is possible it would definitely be nice.<BR> b.) people with see-invis should *not* be able to see us. We are not invisible, we are hiding. I saw a suggestion that someone made as well about evade... they said when we evaded they should lose their target. If this was implemented I could live with people being able to see us while hiding.<P>MAKE POISON: <BR>This is one of the most underused rogue skills in the game... probably even more so than sense/disarm traps now that Velious is out. On my server, I'm one of 3 or so 50+ rogues that uses poison. And even though I use poison, I only use it for PVP. They components need to be *much* easier to get your hands on... I've never even been able to attempt to make a _IV_ series poison. Also, the MAKE POISON SKILL needs to go up *much* easier. I remember sitting in Firiona Vie for hours getting my Make Poison from 80 to 100 or so. Only a couple thousand platinum later, I succeeded. This is easily comparable to alchemy or jewel crafting... the only difference is we DO NOT MAKE PROFIT OFF POISON. Please somehow make this skill go up much much easier. Since I can't get my hands on components without purchasing them, my MAKE POISON skill is at about 122, and has been there since I was level 40 or so.<P>APPLY POISON: <BR>IMO this goes up pretty easily. The only thing is it takes WAY TOO LONG to apply. In a PVP situation this is usually not an issue as you can hide, run off into the background, apply, and run back... but in a PVE situation this is definitely a problem. If you think you can apply first, poison, then begin applying again without having a problem, you are sorely mistaken. Once you agro the mob anyway, sitting down only increases your agro an insane amount. I'm proposing not only being ABLE TO APPLY POISON WITHOUT SITTING DOWN, but possibly decreasing the time it takes to apply as well. Make us unable to move for 1.2 seconds or something, I don't care... but decrease the time it takes to apply noticeably please.<P>RAGEBRINGER:<BR>This weapon is insane. The only thing I'd change is the General... not that he's too hard, he's not . . . plenty of people have their RBs, but in the case of losing the battle with the general, I think there should be some type of redemption quest so you don't have to COMPLETELY REDO THE ENTIRE QUEST. I just tried to think of a way this would be possible but I couldn't come up with anything good... It'd have to be something to prove you did the quest, maybe something like this could be implemented from something each NPC that you have to kill drops in addition to the other stuff you need for your epic anyway. Then if you lose the battle with the general you can go turn in all this until-now useless stuff you've acquired throughout the quest, then you turn it into Stanos or something and he gives you another box so you can spawn the general. This is just an idea, a bad one too the more I look at it, but I'm sure someone with some more creativity can think something up.<P>PETS AND ROGUES:<BR>Someone mentioned this recently on the safehouse boards, and it's seriously a huge pain... to the point of I don't like grouping with magicians. The problems doesn't arise from pets that root... say magician A sends in his pet that I'm the sole person fighting. I'll evade and the MOB will absolutely 100% ignore the mage pet even though it's beating him pretty dang good. This is not a problem with evade... it's a problem with the coding of pets. If I evade, then back off, it will attack the pet. And if I can attack from a good distance, usually the pet can tank normally for a while. But this is an unneeded aggravation. Any changes to this would be appreciated.<P>MRYLO BRACERS:<BR>I put away my 200-range bow because I got some of these. They summon 20 daggers with 55 range. Obviously a rogue doesn't throw for damage. Please INCREASE THESE TO 100 OR SO RANGE (1/2 a good bow)... arrows are cheap, but summoned daggers are free, so there's our penalty of it being free... 1/2 the distance. I've always thought throwing was more roguish anyway.<P>RUNNING SNEAK: I thought the idea someone had about making running sneak take effect a bit earlier was neat. Maybe start it at 41 instead of 51 and make it increase exponentially until at level 60 it’s full run speed. All that would mean is sneak speed would increase half as fast per level as does now… which also means that it would honestly be barely noticeable at 41, probably wouldn’t even be noticeable until level 48 or so. (I base this on the fact that I am just now noticing how fast I sneak at level 54).<P><BR>Alright, that's all for now. I'll post more if I think of anything.<P>Phal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The things mentioned here are by no means things that would shift the balance towards the rogue.  It's just a few things we feel would add a little flavor to the class as a whole while also helping the rest of the Everquest community.  For simplicity, I will break the list into two posts.  First, there are some things we feel need to be addressed overall, things that would affect from several to all classes.  The second post will be specific issues from rogues.<P>First and foremost, we would like to point out that we feel that for the most part, rogues are extremely well balanced.  We find our defensive skills fairly well placed near the bottom of the melee classes, while our offensive melee prowess is unequaled, given a certain set of circumstances.  And that is where we want to stay... the absolute masters of melee damage while being able to take a hit or two, but not much more.<P>Some of the other talks have us a little concerned on a couple of issues.  First, that should monks, for example, gain greater combat power, they would threaten to overtake our current position as the leaders in offense.  As we see it, from top to bottom (pure melee only), offense is rogue, monk, and warrior, while defense is warrior, monk, and rogue.  And we want to keep it that way.  And we do understand the this is only if the rogue has a good taunter to keep the mobs turned.  From the front only, monks will always outdamage us, and well they should.  <P>The second big concern from the monk thread is the one comment, "If anyone is going to be masters of throwing, it might as well be monks".  That perked a lot of eyebrows amongst the rogue community because we have always been told we were the true masters of throwing, thus our special critical and deadly strikes with them, while monks do not.  We think that comment should be reconsidered before the changes are made in the name of balance.<P>And the recent changes on test are a little concerning, as well.  Paladins, Shadow Knights, and Bards have defense skills equal to warriors now, while rangers are now equal in offensive and weapon skills.  So where do monks and rogues fit into this equation?  If balanced as noted above, monks should have slightly higher offensive skills than a warrior, while slightly less defensive, and a rogue should be much higher offensive and a lot less defensive skills.  We just want to be certain we remain where we are... the true masters of melee damage.<P>Also, this list is not all my ideas or concepts.  It is a compilation of many suggestions from rogues on a lot of different servers.  I do not take credit (or blame) for the information included.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Overall:<BR>Any good rogue knows that the only way we remain the masters of melee damage is to have a good taunter.  And I think all of us have at points seen even warriors who apprear to not even know what a taunt button is, and many casters would agree.  With this in mind, we would like to see an across the board increase in the taunt ability (how much taunt affects mob hate) for all the classes that have it.  This will allow the "meat-shields" to continue to fill this role.  Some classes, like rangers, only need a little boost since the taunt factor of snare is high, while warriors need a pretty good boost.<P>In conjunction with this and in an attempt to increase the taunt skills of several classes, Disarm should have the taunt effect drastically increased.  Even some of the rogues have suggested that rogues be given a small (maybe 50 max) taunt skill so we could taunt a mob off a cleric, for instance, so he could get off a heal, even if it did mean we get pounded.  While most rogues disagree with this, most do agree this would be a great benefit to a party, but don't feel rogues need the skill itself.  By increasing the taunt level on disarm, a rogue who needs to "save" his or her cleric could by simply trying to disarm the mob.  By the same token, any class with disarm would gain another skill with which to taunt the mobs (right now, most use taunt, spells, bash, even beg to try to taunt).  This one change to disarm would kill 2 birds with one stone, so to say.<P>Further, in conjunction with the requests of several classes, Disarm needs some major increases in it's usefulness.  We should be able to disarm any weapon a mob has.  That doesn't mean the item drops to the ground, since that would be a really cheesy way to gain some pretty nice magic items.  All weapons disarmed should go to the mob's inventory.  This would allow us (and monks, warriors, etc.) to change a dual-wielding mob into a single-wielding mob.  When weapon speed affected npc attack speed, Disarm was a godsend.  We could disarm a hill giant wielding a fine steel rapier and reduce his attack speed while leaving the ones with staves alone since they were slower.  But now, the skill is nothing more than fun to play with.  And since it does not work on any magical items, it becomes increasingly useless at higher levels.  I've had a monk disarm my Ragebringer in pvp, but I can't disarm a Necropolis rat that is dual-wielding Velium weapons?  What good is that?  Disarm needs this change to remain a viable skill for the classes that have it.<P>Next, we feel that the addition of dyed plate has had an incredible affect on play in that looks do count.  But the question is, why are there no dyed leather or chains?  This would be a trade-skill enhancement that would affect the entire player base.  We could get some black or blue chain for our night out, and then swap to out current jester outfits to actually hunt.  (more on rogue jesters later in the rogue section).<P>Also, Plane of Growth is a good idea gone very bad.  Sure, it's another option for characters to get armor, but risk versus reward is completely wrong.  First off, the armor is comparable to Kunark armor.  While this is fine for the arms, boots, etc., for the breast and legs, it is a complete and total slap in the face.  At 46, you can go to PoG and get armor for half the raiding party, while the same size raiding party but at a minimum level 55 to take out the dragon Trakanon or Venril Sathir himself with a sliver of a chance to get 2 items only.  And the quests in Velius for armor are also not balanced with this.  I know this will cause a stink, but, the minimum level for PoG should be 56, not 46, and the difficulty of the encounters should be much harder.  Either that, or the breast and tunic should only drop from top-level enounters that are on a 3-day minimum spawn cycle.  Also, the drop rate of the Velius quest gems needs to be reviewed.  We have a druid in our group that's had the Thurgadin tunic for over a month and still not found even one of the 3 required Black Marble to complete that quest.  And in that time, tons of tunics have dropped in PoG, where druids cannot get armor.  And I also have the chain tunic, while not one Flawless Diamond has been found.  Lastly, the stats on the armor all need review.  If PoG remains as it is, then the quest (Thurgadin and Kael) armor should be improved (or PoG lowered), and then the SkyShrine quest massively increased, especially since it takes killing with raid-level parties in the Temple of Veeshan to even have a chance for those items (or move the items to another area).<P>We find this a LOT in Velius.  We know all the items cannot be god-level, but when you go on a raid with 30+ players with an average level of 58+, to get an item that would not even be wanted by a lvl 30 player does only one thing... it makes the winner of the item use it to twink.  Black Blade of Torment from Kael is a good example.  It is a rare drop from a very hard mob, and stats are 9-22 1hs effect of Torment and weight of TEN.  Very little chance anyone wants this at this weight.  Perhaps if 10-20, or 9-18 and weight of 5, but not much use like this.  And the giant scalemail from the same area with less stats than most other items ingame.  Risk versus Reward is in dire need of review in several areas.<P>Lastly, as we move deeper and deeper into the game, there are more and more soulbound keys and such.  One suggestion was for a keyring to hold these items.  What we would suggest is a quest that involves bringing some item to the questgiver in order to get a key ring type container.  You would then combine your Sebelis, Charasis, and Veeshan Peeks keys plus a Cobolt Scars tooth into the container, possibly even some more keys, such as the ones from Najena and Tower of Frozen Shadows.  This would grant you a Key of Norrath, one that would remain soulbound, but replace all teeth (well, most know that the CS tooth already replaces all lesser teeth) as well as the Seb, HS, and VP keys with one single key.  This preserves bank and inventory space as well as reducing trips to the bank because the cleric forgot his key.<P>Again, this is not all my ideas, or my fault.  Just things I have seen.<P>Zy</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have seen many people say that melees do more damage than casters.  I do not think casters (or monks or warriors, going off of VIs vision of rogues being the masters of damage) should do as much damage as rogues.  This is for _balance_.  Look at everything every caster can do.  Now look at everything your rogue can do.  Goodness, we _should_ be doing the most damage.  We are the most unwanted in groups, most dependent class out there, but because of our history we don't whine enough, I guess.  <P>I like my rogue, but I spend a lot of time looking for a group, much much more than I do when I play my other classes.  Please listen to the suggestions that repeatedly pop up in this thread... We know what we are talking about!  We have just not been as vocal as other classes lately, but don't think that because we don't squeak all the time we don't need some grease.<P>And don't think we need downgraded just because other classes are complaining they don't do as much damage.<P>Thanks.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Why must you decontent the rogue class? Everyone else gets increased abilities and the rogues get nerfed? Dont touch evade please. Dont reduce damage. If you think rogues are overpowered then maybe you should play one everyday. I quit my shaman because we sucked. Now I have to quit playing my rogue as well? Its not that rogues will be weak, but its that there will be no way to not feel like we were slighted amidst all of the other class enhancements.<P>Sometimes I dont understand how you fellas think. Please leave the class alone if you cant add anything. Evade still doesnt save me from death at times and is not a fail safe to be at the *bottom* of the agro list. Reducing damage is not even an option. You need to reevaluate what it is you achieve by this.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR><P>- Poison problems:  Most rogues don't even bother with poison any more (or never did) because the effects are just not worth it for how much you have to spend and carry.  First, we have to either camp greens endlessly just to try to find the components at all or buy them from lesser levels, which means bartering, and then only if we can find someone who has since there are already other rogues trying to farm them.  Then, the costs of the poisons as a whole are not justified by the results.  Couple this with having to carry stacks of vials, suspensions, and components for a chance to make (if not failed) and carrying a 6-slot poison kit instead of a 10-slot pack for all the loot we swipe.  <P>Poison Suggestions (in order of importance):  First, stackable poisons.  This means we could carry our normal packs and stacks of poison instead of full packs of components.  Verant released a long time ago that poison and shaman potions could not be stackable.  Well, potions are now, so why not poison, too?  Second, just as shamans potions were too hard to find components for, so are our poisons.  Add a poison component merchant somewhere dangerous that a rogue would need skills to reach.  Perhaps in the sewers of Cabalis, meaing a rogue would need stealth (or the Iksar disguise) to reach the area.  And other areas, as well.  Perhaps the best components would be on a merchant in Dragon Necropolis.  Just allow us to obtain the items a little more easily than to farm them from greens.  Third, add suspensions to the brewing skill.  We can already make vials with pottery, so suspensions from brewing makes sense.  This would mean almost all items could be either made/farmed or purchased.  Lastly, the poison effects need to be reviewed for effectiveness based on the time/cost to make them.  Just as with the shaman alchemy, there are a lot of poisons that are not worthwhile at all.  It was suggested to make the poison effect like a proc, similar to Vamperic Embrace.  This would be a complete revamp (rogues learn poison recipes as a caster scribes spells, and when the poison is "cast" is uses the made poison as a spell would use a gem to grant the rogue a poison proc for a short time) of the poison system.  While many agree would be an extremely good enhancement, we do not think it viable with the current existing system.  But it is worth the suggestion, and perhaps noted for future projects.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>- Stealth problems:  Rogue are also the undisputed masters of stealth.  However, with the addition of Velius, more and more areas have become restricted from us as many more mobs now can see us move around.  Additionally, in many cases, there are mobs just across the zone line, meaning for the first time in their career, many rogue actually have to request invis so they can safely zone.  Additionally, the recent change to bardsong to not break hide was phenomenal.  But their invis song still hurts us.  When hide/sneak is on, if someone tries to cast invis on us, we get "xxx tried to cast invis on you, but you are already invis"  But bardsong just stacks, then when the bard is out of range and the song fades, we become visible, breaking our hide.<P>Stealth Solutions:  First, allow hide/sneak to work across zone-lines.  If this is not possible, then perhaps a rogue-only questable nodrop item, such as an Earring of Shadows that has the unlimited affect of Gather Shadows so that we can invis across a zoneline.  This is the least desirable solution, but would be acceptable if we can't have hide/sneak work across a zone-line.  Second, have bardsong invis also not stack with hide-sneak.  This would eliminate the problem not only rogues have of bardsong messing with our stealth, but it does the same thing to other invis characters as well.<P>Another solution since it is evident that hide/sneak will not work over zones would be a questable mask or earring or something (as noted), except that instead of Gather Shadows, would be a new spell effect, one that is self only and last only 40 seconds max.  It would allow the rogue time to cross a zone or to camp and still be able to relog and hit hide-sneak before being seen.  Also, when the invis drops, it should not drop hide (make rogue visible).<P>One other thing mentioned was a complaint that wizards could bonk a sneaking rogue.  The suggestion was to have hide be different than invis and give casters a new See Shadows spell.  Not sure how this would be different, but it was a point noted.<P>- Evade problems:  We can't hide while moving.  This is not generally a problem.  But in combat, when the mob is on us, we get pounded and bashed, so can't evade.  It also make evade completely useless in underwater encounters because you can be certain you will not be still to hide there, being beat on or not.  This eats enormous amounts of cleric mana trying to keep us alive while we wait on the hide to recycle.  While evade is an incredible help, in this case, it doesn't much help.  Also, in pvp, casters can target a rogue and fire, even if the rogue is hidden and the caster not have see invis.  Also, in melee combat, the enemy keeps the rogue targetted, so evade is useless.<P>Evade solutions:  Either make hide recycle quicker if the attempt was botched because moving or allow rogues to hide while moving.  The other less desirable solution would be to add a quest for an item that granted an instant-cast Jolt effect so that we could evade if we have need and can't.  Sure, evade is always better than Jolt, but at least Jolt might buy us a second so we could evade.  Personally, I would prefer allowing rogues to hide while moving and not want the Jolt, but it is an option.  As for pvp, the solution is that evade removes you from the enemy targetting, just as if you zoned.  The enemy would have to simply retarget you.  If a spell is already in works, the spell would still hit, but the caster would have to retarget before casting again.<P>Further, to those complaining about the evade "nerf" I see no problem with this at all.  As was posted by someone else, if you my to 5th on the list of 55th, what difference does it make?  This change is actually a good one to balance the class (providing the change still works better than ranger Jolt spell).<P>- Throwing problems:  Aside from the problem noted above "why not monks", many rogues still have problems with throwing.  First, almost all throwing weapons are very short range and low damage.  Sure, a bow should fire an arrow farther than someone could throw it, but the range is so short that most mobs will aggro before the weapons can be thrown.  Also, our critical and deadly strikes are a little low.  Just as monks are embarrassed by a 24 Thunderous Kick, so too are rogues embarrassed by a 24 Deadly Strike.  Deadly my foot! <P>Throwing solutions:  Monks got a new bracer in Velius with the summoned shuriken with long range, while rogues are still using the Mrylokar with summon daggers at a much lower range.  Add this same affect to the rogue Velius bracers so we can benefit from this longer-range throwing item as well.  Additionally, add more variety of throwing items, such as some with effects.  A ranger can find or quest for a bow with nice stats and range, plus a proc (one with a shamans 80-ish damage spell comes to mind), while rogues have to carry many stacks of daggers, etc. and nothing has procs.  One other suggestion was a boomerang or similar item that would return to be thrown again, and item with a long range and extremely long delay, something like 10 damage, 200 delay, and 150 range, and a few stats perhaps.  This would grant rogue (and monk, maybe) the ability to pull with it without carrying tons of items.  Also, possibly a fletched dart to allow for some tradeskills, as well.  As for the Deadly Strikes, the best solution was to have deadly strike use the backstab formula when it hits, especially since it hits from behind anyway.  Sure, backstab with a 6 damage throwing dagger is not going to be close to the 15 damage Ragebringer, but it would still grant us the minimum hits based on level and some realistic deadly strikes.<P>- Appearance Problems:  Assassin's Armor is absolutely totally and completely HIDEOUS!  What self-respecting rogue would possibly want to wear something that looks like a banana suit from a costume party?  Sure, the stats are grand, but the look is terrible.  Much of the new armor is the same way.  The Gladiator arms and legs from the Arena in Kael have newbie or no graphic also, and it's for several classes.  Even I look more like a Jester than a rogue.  Assassin's hat on a halfling is normal chain, boots are moldy chain.  Ice Shackle is a kind of yellow-green with a pattern, and assassin's is bright gold.  Woven Shadows tunic is gray, Darkscale greeves is dark blue-black.  Plus gray WS gloves and the no-graphic gladiator arms (the butch look).  I now look like a jester, where before Velius, I was all black and gray.<P>Appearance solutions:  Change the armor color on Assassin's from yellow/gold to maybe dark blue or gray.  Also, add some graphic, even if just the same black chain as the Giant Scalemail from Kael to the Gladiator armor.  We did hear that Assassin's wasn't going to change, and it's kinda sad to hear, but only really matters to us rogues that like to look like rogues, not just poke like 'em.<P>- Other enhancements: There were some other enhancements suggested that many of us agree would be definite flavor for our class as a whole, while some may even benefit other classes as well.<P>Discipline: Sprint - A new discipline that grants the user a vrey short burst of movement speed, perhaps 10 to 15 seconds of Spirit of Wolf speed, with a recycle time of 30 minutes or more.  The discipline would be approximately level 50 to 52.  It would break all other forms of movement plus breaking hide-sneak, etc.  The use would be for a quick escape, something similar to Druid-Shaman Spirit of Cheetah... limited use, but extremely helpful in emergency situations.  It would allow a puller that was overrun to perhaps make a zone or get back to his or her healer, or a rogue that was caught sneaking around to get back to the safety of the group.  And the skill should be usable anywhere, indoors or out.  Also, it is felt this should be monk, warrior, and rogue.<P>Discipline: Stealth - A new Discipline at level 56 or higher that would grant the rogue pure stealth.  The discipline would last 2 to 3 minutes with a 75 or 90 minute recycle time to avoid abuse.  When the skill is activated, the rogue can hide-sneak and gain beta-neutral faction to all npc ingame, including dragons, gods, etc.  It would be pure invisibility to everything on the npc side.  The use would be for corpse recovery from very nasty spots, such as deep in Kael or from Trakanon's Lair.  We do see that there could be possible abuse with the skill, thus the extreme recycle time.  You might could get past Trakanon once, but would be trapped for quite some time before able to get by again.  One rogue using this discipline could not pull all the bodies from under a dragon, but could pull some key ones, or several rogues could pull quite a few.  Having the recycle at 75+ minutes would help reduce the abuse of the skill.<P>Discipline: Shadowstrike - A new discipline similar to monk Thunder Kick, that would grant the next backstab a damage increase, and a displayed increase similar to Thunker Kick.  Another suggestion was a discipline that worked similar to warrior defensive, but was offensive in nature, perhaps 2 minutes of fairly good attack value increase with a 30+ minute recycle.<P>Several have complained that warriors criticals get displayed, and monk Thunder Kick, while our 500+ point backstabs do not.  If worried about battle-spam, then remove the warrior critical displays.  The complain is a rogue double-backstabs for 500+ each, doing more than 1000 damage on a single strike, then hear the group or folks fighting near say, "Nice Critical, WarriorDewd!" after seeing a 300 point critical strike.  Now, some rogues think this request vain and show-offish, but others have it as a real issue.<P>Rogues are the masters of stealth, yet cannot track or stalk anyone.  Some have requested a very small skill in Tracking, perhaps 10, so that we can track at a very short range.  Others have suggested a new skill called Stalk that would be similar to Sense Undead in that it would turn the rogue to the closes npc and then track it until canceled, thus allowing a rogue to stalk something.<P>Instill Doubt is a very nice skill in some cases, and for a monk, is extremely reliable.  Rogues, however, do not get any skill in kick, so in many cases, a rogue will fail Instill Doubt simply because the kick did not land.  The solution would be to give rogues, at higher levels (higher than ID is awarded), the ability to kick, but with a limited cap, perhaps cap of 50.  This would massively help ID to actually land on a mob, rather than just missing.  We have no problem with the rate of success, just the rate of the kick hitting.  Otherwise, it does have it's uses.<P>Safefall skill caps need to be increased.  Rogues are capped faily low, considering we are so agile and dexterous.<P>Rogues are meant to be some what of loners, so some have suggested a small amount of forage skill so that we can perhaps forage a little grub, or possibly even forage some poison components, which would help resolve some of the poison issues.  Others feel this is indeed not a rogue skill in any way, and that if a rogue wants foraging, he should be a wood elf.<P>More quests on the scale of the Burning Rapier or similar to RageBringer are greatly desired.  Many thrive on the quests and their complexity, many of them involving a lot more than just kill mobbie01 and bring me his head.  Perhaps a quest for the Mask of Obstenerate instead of being mob dropped, and other such items.  Also, change the Ravenscale from mob-dropped to quested.  Maybe you still need to kill the CT mobs for one of their items, but the armor itself must be quested to obtain.<P>Some have suggested that since rogues are the masters of disguise, there should be more illusion masks, perhaps even some that are pottery-made (perhaps 1 charge or so, and 180 or more pottery skill, using clay, water, a special gem, and an enchanter illusion scroll).  This would affect all classes, not just rogues because pottery is not a rogue skill.  The arguement is what better way to master stealth than to be one with your enemy.  There are others on this issue, however, that note rogues are masters of stealth, not disguise, and if any more illusions are granted, they should be very limited, and by quest only, and a very difficult quest at that.<P>Soulbound Lockpicks is far and away the most requested enhancement.  Perhaps a Solusek Ro quest, given by the Burning Rapier quest guy.  The quest should be fairly well involved and require mechanical lockpicks as part of the turn-in (so as to involve some trade skills), and need a minimum level to complete, perhaps level 30 or so.  This would reduce storage of extra lockpicks (I actually keep 2 extra sets in the bank for emergencies), as well as trips to the bank for them.  And along these same lines, and in conjunction with the Key of Norrath quest noted above, a second quest for those well over level 50 (perhaps 55+) for a set of Master Lockpicks, which involve turning in a Key of Norrath, your Soulbound Lockpicks, and some other involved quest items.  And the Master Lockpicks would function as lockpicks as well as the Key of Norrath, plus remain soulbound, thus eliminating a lot of soulbound items.  <P>One other suggestion on lockpicks was to allow the RageBringer to double as lockpicks (not picking the lock with the tip, but maybe a small copartment in the handle that hides the picks) similar to the bard weapon doubling as all instuments.  It would indeed be unbalanced to have RB soulbound, while not all other epics were not.  It was suggested that all epic weapons be soulbound, but others have noted it would be more "fun" to have the epics as is and actually quest for the soulbound lockpicks, especially since we have requested more quests anyway.<P>On the issue of quests (and this will surely start an arguement, but it was suggested), the RageBringer quest needs to be reviewed for it's ease.  Many rogues have been actually disappointed that the Burning Rapier was not actually a requirement for the final goal.  The suggestion was made that the rapier reward instead of being the same pouch as is received from the start of the quest, that either another weapon be awarded, or some unique item that must also be turned in to Stanos for the final reward.  This would lengthen the quest considerably and make it on par with some of the other classes.  It is still of concern that the genreal could actually be spawned 2 or 3 times in a night, while classes like bards and warriors must wait on dragon spawns, but this at least would make the quest more epic, and covering the life of the rogue.  Others have argued that it would not be fair at this point to change it, and even that all rogues do not feel they NEED to be redeemed.  Then again, the quest can also be give if rather than saying "I am in need of redemption", you say something like "I am not in need or your or any redemption".  So there are pros and cons on both sides of this one.  Me personnally, I did get all the rapiers for that part of the quest, and I loved the BR, used it for quite some time.  The other suggestion was to make the rapiers instead of the swords award the dagger, and change the dagger to really rare drop, like the quill.  (None of these proposed changes are the agreed opinion of all rogues, but several have voiced concerns on the issue).<P>One other "nerf" that was suggested was to have weight affect sneak speed.  If, for example, the rogue were at 100% capacity, sneak would go very slow, even when SoW is on, while if weight were only 50% or so, sneak would be at maximum speed (for the current level).  We are not certain just how possible this is with the existing mechanics, but would add more realism to the skill.  Just how sneaky can you be carrying around 1500 copper?<P>Melee skills are everything to a rogue.  We are masters of piercing, but our slashing and blunt skills match piercing.  Perhaps a small increase in our piercing skill so that it remains the skill of choice.  Also requested were more variety in blunt and slashing weapons, especially at mid-levels.<P>Lastly, it was suggested that our riposte and parry skills be increased at least to the level of monks, perhaps even a little higher.  We are offensive masters.  We do not need monk skill levels in block and dodge, but since we are masters of melee, we should be masters of all melee.  This change would not shift the balance and let us talk like a warrior as our overall defensive skills would remain the same, but would allow us some little measure of an offensive defense.  It also grants us another method of remaining the true masters of melee damage.<P>Now, this is a very long and detailed summary of the suggestions made, but cover almost everything that was discussed.  We don't see any one of these changes as being class-defining or balance-shifting changes, but do have concerns that if the others changes go into place, other classes will take over our place in the overall scheme (rangers getting warrior offensive skills sould give them massive damage increase, and with their current available weaponry, possibly outdamage a rogue... how do rogues compare to warrior offensive skills).  This is not to say that some of the changes are not needed, just that we want to retain our place as the true wizards of melee.<P>Zyvalla Kwikfingers<BR>House Arcanum of BristleBane Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>To throw my 2 cents in here. <P>I do not play a rouge, nor do I plan to. But let me say, I have passed a rouge by when grouping in the past because of the pickpocket skill. I understand that most rouges are very honest, but some are not and thus the pickpocket skill tends to give all rouges a bad name in general. <P>I think it would go a long way to solving this problem if it were somehow announced when a rouge sucessfully pickpocketed something from a Mob. For example on a dragon raid, if an emote were generated saying something to the effect "Snicker(rouges name) has taken something of value from Gronaire". Or maybe have the mob say something like "Snicker (rouges name), your theft has attracted my Wrath." In my opinion this would help remove some of the stigma associatied with rouges.<P>I'm perfectly fine letting the players ostracize a rouge that pickpockets when he should not, but right now it often turns into a guessing game about when a rouge does or does not pickpocket, and it allows certain rouges to take blame for something when they should not.<P>Peredur</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As a level 60 rogue on the bristlebane server, I feel that the rogue class is fairly well balanced.<BR>I can understand the reasoning behind the 'nerf' on evade; however, in my experiences I usually get turned on shortly after a successful evade as it stands.  The main issue I would like to see for the rogue class is to allow us to hide/sneak across zones.  I also feel that the plane of sky items should be looked at as far as risk vs reward, it seems that obtaining these items requires far more effort than finding better items with less effort, this applies to all classes actually.  Also, I have used countless backpacks full of bandages and have not received a skill increase in bind wounds, perhaps this skill should raise a bit more quickly.  The ability to critical and deadly strike with thrown weapons is very nice, but in actuality the damage is very insignificant and with our thrown weapons not hitting if there is a mob in the way, it makes throwing only useful for pulling.  I would like to see the damage on throwing crits and deadly strikes increased slightly.  Lastly, I am really hoping that you guys are planning on providing more illusion masks for us to acquire, because everyone loves toys.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Thanks,<BR>Krymson<BR>Level 60 Assassin of Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I was not at all happy when pickpocket was changed to steal cash from the loot pool--since I'd never looted 35 copper from a gnoll pup, and I had made those sorts of picks from them, I know it didn't used to.  (Although I was never sure on items, but since it won't steal magic items that didn't really concern me.)<P>If pickpocket "creates" a small amount of cash, then cash is entering the world slightly faster, and perhaps that's why it was changed.  But, shouldn't thieves have a little more pocket change than the average adventurer?  Further, the various money sinks put in place seem to have done their job--most big trades aren't for platinum only, but they sometimes are, and plat is a common "sweetener" from what I've seen.<P>No other serious complaints... I played a rogue to 30 before Evade existed, and so far as I'm concerned, that was the final addition that balanced the class out.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I was wondering if this was some sort of bug or miscalculation in the system.<P>Too often when moving around a mob or just newly facing a back and I begin landing attacks and hit backstab, I'll get the messages "you cannot see your target from here" (in the case of facing slightly to the side) or "you are too far away" (most common - just out of range of pickpocket but not melee).  Having to maneuver around things and timing my evades to land them, I can't just stand facing directly at the mob's back, (which wouldn't happen if I stood still anyway - they chase casters and spin between tanks) three feet from it (insta-death). So I miss too many backstabs to these stupid red messages.<P>Please, for the love of god, bring range of backstab up the entire extra half foot to match regular melee, or kill any bug that would cause this problem. And I don't see how having the mob to one side of the screen while you can still land any other attack being a real game issue, please fix this for our sanity.<P>- Also, the red messages that apply to regular melee, applied to backstabs, can be confusing in a dead rush to kill something - please give any backstab faults their own message, as the pickpocket etc. skills do.<P>Thank you for your time.<BR>Mlaanie of Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I want to start out w/ a quote from the safehouse:<BR>What we all SHOULD have said in Rogue Talk...<BR>"Verant, all you have to do to make sure rogues remain balanced is this one little thing...<P>do WHATEVER Kendrick says." <P>--Ender<P>Basically, I think rogues are balanced now. I hope that the weapons from Necropolis/WW hit the market. Post 50, weapons are like, CSS, bloodpoint, extremely rare stuff I'll never see.<P>Other things I think are important for rogues:<P>This is by far the greatest thing I'd like.  PLEASE take the range limit off of throwing weapons. Any weapon that clasifies as throwing weapon, (except maybe shurikens) could be used at any range. including just as a weapon to stab in someones back and leave.  Also, throwing weapons of rougly the same dmg/dly of some midlvl weapons would nice, (Hey, I"m an optimist =).<P>Poisons:<BR>-Have the lower lvl components drop more. Or make them buyable.<BR>-Make them stackable. (I have 1/2 my bank inventory used for poison stuff. I've got like 1 of each component.)<P>Soul bound lockpicks would be a very important change.  On CR for a group, having to take a trip back to the bank to get picks can be a very large problem.  This will only be compounded if you add more bind points.  Plus, this would provide a rogue quest in the 30-50 region<P>As for the evade change, I see no problem with it as long as the change is something along the lines of:  either move rogue down the agro list by 4 or 5 notches (second to last or last on list) or 1/2-2/3rds down list.  Whichever is biggest.  I don't have  a problem with being above many of the casters and those people just watching, but I can see there being a problem if I evade, but the warrior is dead and now I"m the only one anywhere near the top of the list.<P>Oh, and I'm sure you've read a ton of the threads at the safehouse that started over a week ago.  I won't post links since you said you really didn't want it, but they really expressed most conserns well.  I think the most promonent being: Poisons, Throwing weapons, upper lvl weapons between TT and ragebringer, is there anything that can be done abour ragebringer particle effect? Either non, or something ddifferent.  It's a bit silly right now.<P>also, a large consern is Eldereth with the ragebringer quest.  I don't think we mind so much how long a spawn he is, but we would appriciate it if it was a little easier to predict/know when he is up, etc.  a 18/19 hour spawn that doesn't always come up and is camped is nasty.  There are rogues camping him anywhere from 12 to 72 hours at a time.  Also, I think requiring a burning rapier would maybe help increase the dificulty if making Eldreth more constant were considered making the quest too easy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just a few things, mostly stuff that's been said, but the more people that point it out the more chance Absor will listen to us...<P>POISON<BR>Very cool, a definate defining point for rogues.  But it is too expensive considering what must be done for it.  A simple asp poison (like 50-150DD) costs around 4pp to try, and you actually have to make 2 successful skill checks (create and apply) to use it.  Not to mention that even something as simple as the asp poison takes 5-10 minutes to find 2 asp venoms, not to mention a special trip to a low level zone to farm the items.<P>Not to mention that they are far too cumbersome without being able to stack them.<P>THROWING<BR>I'm a 30th level rogue, and am a master fletcher. Even with the chance of a critical hit, i'm doing much more damage with a decent bow and some 4 dmg arrows. Either give us an inherent throwing bonus (range and damage) or let us have crits on all ranged weapons, since due to backstab we rogues know where to hit em to make it hurt.<P>EVADE<BR>Since rogues are so good at sneaking around, what if we were able to hide from a mob for, say, 30 seconds without getting attacked by the mob, we would be wiped off of its aggro list.  That way it would in no way be as good as FD, but if you have REALLY made a mob mad with backstabbin it, you can just hide from combat for a bit and let it forget about you.<P>SNEAK<BR>Sneaking across zones would be great.  Invis works that way, why shouldnt it?  In the sense of the game, why all of the sudden crossing the plains of karana, do i suddenly appear for no reason?<P>FLYING<BR>I like the idea on the first page about giving rogues the abliity to fly too  :-)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I believe that rogues are, for the most part balanced.  I would like to see a couple of things, though.  I feel that poison components (venom sacs, etc.) should be a tad more common than they are. <BR>Also I really really really really want my Burning Rapier to burn again.  It's one of the best quests in the game, and a true Rogue status symbole, like the soulfire sword.  It was taken out because some rogues complained that it went against rogue sneakiness.  True, but when we're sneaking around, nobody can see us, so it doesn't make much difference.  As it stands now, we just have a plain-ole rapier, that just happens to kick some butt.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Can Hide/Sneak be made to do the same?<BR>2)Poison: All vials and suspension have the exact same 'look' in inventory.  Can there be a different graphic for at least between vials and suspension, and at most between each kind of vial and suspension?<BR>3)Poison: This may have been mentioned before, but Having at least a comperable 'bear-skin bag' for poisons, would be super to reduce the conjested inventories.<P>thats it, Thanks<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1. Hide/Sneak skill should not be visable by people who are using "See Invis". This is not a spell affect, It is a skill. The spell is kind of like a illusion. It fools the eye to make it appear you are not there. Hide is a skill, you are quite and smart enough to simply stay out of sight.<P>2. You should be able to Hide/Sneak accross zone lines. (casters can with their invis spells)<P>3. On PvP Servers you should be able to pick pocket people on other teams.

</FONT><HR>Beyond that weird red message peeve I don't have any other problems with the rogue class up to level 41.<P>I like the early level disciplines implimented in the Velious expansion, it adds some flavor to the in-between times while skills are capping and you're just itching to get to 51.  Kudos!<P>Please - PLEASE - for the love of Bristlebane, don't touch the Evade skill.

</FONT><HR>For the record, I play a 39 rogue on Fennin as my main. (been 39 for damn near a month too, been screwing around a lot and playing twinks)<P>1) Sneak/hide: I realize this has been beaten to death, but I have some things to say...<BR>a) Make it persist over zoning. It's really really really annoying to zone into a train that 80% of my other characters could avoid in some way from their own version of invis. <BR>b) Please change evade so that a) you don't have to click off autoattack to get it to work (this makes no sense and is very annoying) and b) it can't be interruppted by you moving. <BR>c) The hide key should not gray out if the game "thinks" you're moving when you hit it. Failing that, if you hit sneak first it should work. You don't have to stop to start sneaking...<BR>d) Sneak/hiding should overwrite ALL other forms of invis... currently, if you're sneak/hiding, and the bard starts singing the invis song... when the invis song stops, you become visible, even though sneak/hide are STILL considered active. I can show you a log in mistmoore of such an incident. Wasn't too pretty, for me or my group. Aggroed on me, then aggroed on the bard because he was still singing.<BR>e) Increased speed sneaking needs to come earlier. I'm no better at sneaking than I was at level 19, when I reached the cap of 100. Sneak is currently at about 160, which is way undermaxed for my current level, because I have no reason to work it up.<P>2) Poisons: Make them stackable... and make them easier to get, for god's sake. I spent THREE HOURS in unrest farming grave molds, I didn't even get half a stack, which was only enough for FOUR attempts at a poison.<P>3) Masks: Please fix this so you can click them off. Enchanters can, we should be able to also. Also, as has been said, an easier to get "good" mask would be nice.<P>4) Ravenscale: PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE MAKE THIS QUESTABLE. I spent SIX levels in Cazic Thule trying to get RS, and EVERY PIECE that I got I had to roll on, or my friend rolled on and won and then gave to me. I'm still missing the arms. This is ridiculous, no other class has to do this. Nobody questioned the SK looting their decayed armor, despite this being RARER than RS. I saw TWICE as much RS drop as decayed.<P>5) Weapons: Add more rogue usable piercers, specifically daggers. My main is currently using a spine chill spear. The damn thing is longer than I am tall. But until I get an SCH (ANOTHER SPEAR) or a Trak Tooth, it's the best ratio I can find. Speaking from a backstab damage standpoint, piercers progress fairly nicely up to about Serrated Bone Dirk, then Jagged Chokadai Spine, and then there's a rather LARGE gap between that and Trak Tooth, except for spears (arg). Also, more throwing weapons... would give me an excuse to work up the skill, since I currently only use it when (rare situation, granted) pulling.<P>6) Additional skills, like taunt, kick, etc... *shrugs* I could go either way with this. But instill doubt and disarm work so damn rarely they're practically useless. The one time I got it ID to stick on a blue it wore off 6 seconds later.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The only thing I would want to see changed about the rogue is how poison works.  In my estimation it is one of the hardest trade skills due to the fact that you have to find almost all the ingredients as monsters drops.  But it really isn't even the difficulty, thats ok, its the time factor, or more specially the time factor to usefulness ratio. I think that rogue poison should be the defining trait of the "assassin" class, even more so than back stab, though, and don't get me wrong. I know in current EQ back stab is where the main stay is, and I am not going to suggest you make poison so good that it over shadows back stab.<P>To get to the point, currently poison works like this. You sit down and apply the poison this is of course after you took what was probably hours getting and making 3-5 vials. Now those vial are all one proc all or nothing uses, if you fail to apply your SoL, thats ok, all trade skills are all or nothing. I'm just trying to emphasis how it is to use the skill as a player. Now assuming you have gotten a dose on your weapon you now have one chance to proc it on a monster and at that it has a fair chance of being resisted, and again there is no problem with rests except that it made so much time seem like such a waste.<P>That how it is to use the skill currently its very time consuming for very little reward, granted some of the spells have decent power... well the slows have decent power, and the cripple ones are probably good on pvp, but the dd's and dots are basically just equal to one extra back stab.<P>Ok, that was the explanation of the skill as I see it, which is what you asked for... detail.<P>Here now are two ways I think the skill could be made much better.  The first way is only for the rogues themsevles and this is a good way to not make such drastic changes at the second way which I will explain later.<P>I think the passions should work like procs and last until you zone. I think this is how all rogues way back when poison was just about to be added thought it was going to be, I know I did.  Now I understand that the poisons themselves in there current state would be much too powerful to be procs, the slows and dots and dds would all have to be tuned, and this would of course equal a lot of work, but it is how I think most players would feel it should be. Especially given the fact that many classes have proc spells. which is good at least we know part of the code is in.<P><BR>Or here is how poison really should be... include all that was in the first post about it being proc. Poison in my opinion really should be more of a trade skill. With many of the components beign available on rogue vendors, enough that there are a few basic procs that can be mass produced, nothing major maybe a small dd a dot and a few debuffs that can be totally made at the vendor the way shamans and most other tradesman can. Then change the way apply poison works such that it can be used on other players by tagetting them as the way to tell the game knows where the poison is going, rogues would target themselves to apply to themselves. And of course there should still be poisons that are higher level and more powerful that can only be gotten as drops like the current system, of course they wouldn't be as powerfull as the current posions due to the proc nature, but they would be more powerful than the vendor poisons.<P>This type of change really would make poison something the players would really see in there game play life, as poison is now, if you even see a rogue use a poison in your playing career well your lucky.  And as Rogues no one really uses it, except to have the skill, I don't know of a single rogue who has ever told me they use poison for more than for duels or just because they happened to make some while rasing there skill so there using it. <P><BR>Thanks for reading this far, I didn't ready many of the posts past the first page which was mostly "first post" posts so if someone said what I said before me kudos to them and I hope you take what they said seriously heh.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The single most hated thing about rogues is the fact that we can be seen while hideing by a " see INVISIBLE" spell.<P>What is invisible, it is a magical method of fooling ones eyes into not seeing them.<P>What is hide in shadows, it is the art of blending in with the shadows. Being near impossible to see, naturaly.<P>Why on earth can see invisible detect a rogue hideing in the shadows?<P>It makes our skill pretty useless in PvP, considering EVERYONE has see invis cast on them <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>That in a nut shell is MY ONLY request. I share this feeling with MANY people.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I do not play a high level rogue (only 32) but so far i almost never see any effect from evade i will evade and the mob will still be beating me down while the warrior is trying to taunt it of (maybe i do to much dmg) <BR>i almost never use posions because it is cheeper to buy a much better weapon then to build this skill.  it takes alot of time to get the stuff for must of the posions and involves "Farming" low level mobs.<BR>Also i like instill doubt but i wish i could use it on something that is a higher level then a skeleton.  It occasionly works but then the mob resists it almost ever time, very annyoning.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
