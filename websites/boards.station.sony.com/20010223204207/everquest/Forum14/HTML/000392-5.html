</FONT><HR><BR>-----------------------------------------------------------<BR>Pets...what a joke.<P>-----------------------------------------------------------<BR>root...another joke.<P>-----------------------------------------------------------<BR>fizzle rates...the joke's on us?<P>-----------------------------------------------------------<BR>stun resists...been happening for so long I've just stopped even thinking that you would do anything about it so it doesn't matter anymore.<P>-----------------------------------------------------------<BR>mana regen...it's been one of the all encompassing beliefs from you guys that clerics are NOT casters and they are NOT tanks so what the hell are we?  As someone else posted earlier you've given every other casting class some form of mana regen to help them with downtime.  <P>-----------------------------------------------------------<BR>melee skills like parry and dodge...wouldn't hurt but, as in the past attempts to try to get some help keeping clerics alive this won't fly either so putting it on the list is yet another joke.<P>-----------------------------------------------------------<BR>defense increase...should've been done a long time ago but, like melee skill increases, it's a joke and you'll never do anything to help so not worth worrying about.<P>-----------------------------------------------------------<BR>bash...worthless if you're a good cleric and sitting and medding every chance you get.<P>-----------------------------------------------------------<BR>bind wounds...same as bash; worthless if you're a good cleric and sitting and medding every chance you get.<P>-----------------------------------------------------------<BR>death pact/divine intervention...I'm a bad cleric cuz I refuse to even bother anymore.  I've seen it go off 5 times ever and they still died quickly afterward.  Guess my charisma just blows?<P>-----------------------------------------------------------<BR>make of karn...used to work now it's only good for removing damage shields and pulling.<P>-----------------------------------------------------------<BR>celestial heal...I don't even use this anymore.  Takes about the same amount of time to cast as divine light and doesn't even keep up with the damage my tanks are eating.  Another good attempt but, while it would've done me good at 39th - 53th levels for sure at 59th it's fairly worthless.  BTW as a side note here to my fellow clerics, I don't fizzle this as often as I fizzle MoK, remedy, have a gate collapse on me or, believe it or not...have root fizzle on me.  root?? /boggle<P>-----------------------------------------------------------<BR>heroism/heroic bond...works fine as it in my opinion.  it's up to the cleric to pay attention to their first cast of bond to determine who has something else on them and then tell that person it's up to them to let you know when to recast bond.  Sure it's a waste of mana and buffing sucks in general but at least the option is there and you can make the person with something else on them take the responsibility of calling for the next cast.<P>-----------------------------------------------------------<BR>hammer spells...useless in the beginning and still worthless as ever.  They're barely better then a rusted warhammer so, other then the ability to summon something to be sure your next corpse doesn't decay too soon (and why wouldn't you summon something useful like food and water instead?).<P>-----------------------------------------------------------<BR>invisibility...Alan and Gordon both have made it abundantly clear that clerics would NEVER have this ability so having it on the list is a joke.<P>-----------------------------------------------------------<BR>ac lines of spells...now this one is a personal pet peeve of mine.  These spells, in general, SUCK!  They suck the mana dry, they don't significantly help anyone that doesn't go over any of the 800, 900, 1*00 marks.  Any good warrior will tell you that ac buffs will only make a difference for them if it takes them over one of those levels.  That's all well and good but these spells are damned expensive to cast and take a long time to cast on top of that.  I've actually gotten to the point where I won't even cast an ac buff unless asked specifically for it.<P>-----------------------------------------------------------<BR>Banishment of Shadows....this spell is so useless that some clerics and necro's on my server have actually laughed and said no thanks.<P>-----------------------------------------------------------<BR>root or mez undead...well mez is encroaching on an enchanter's job (let's not mention necro's ok?) so that won't do.  Root, we already have (although it's been, imo, one of the worst implementations of a spell type) so why is this even listed?<P>-----------------------------------------------------------<BR>gate to temple...would be great for when I needed to go to the bank or something but don't see this as anything that VI would implement so yet more ascii text space filled for naught.<P>-----------------------------------------------------------<BR>diety specific spells...shoulda been done from the git go.  woulda made it more of a choice on which race to be.  coulda made the whole class more interesting and fun to play. /shrug<P>-----------------------------------------------------------<BR>Anyone detect some bitterness here?  59 thankless levels of having to deal with heal/sit/heal/sit/buff/sit/sit/sit/heal/sit/ rinse and repeat.<P>I would love to see some good improvements done to the class in general but I think that VI is so involved in their "pet" classes like necro/shadow knights/rogues and such that there just isn't enough time left for them to peer into our functional class.  We can heal and we can buff so what more should be ask for?  This is the general feeling I'm getting overall.  What's my solution?  Get Azhami to 60 and then retire her and go play one of the classes that VI actually spends time making improvements on.<P>Well, been fun ripping through this list some.  Won't make a lick of difference but was still fun.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Regarding the new changes posted:<P>Changing HoT spells: Wonderful! Absolutely great, thank you!<P>Changing the Hate lists: Hmmm, uhoh. Have you reviewed exactly how this will affect the balance issues between cleric/druid/shaman in Post-50 play? I am 49th, so I won't claim to know alot about it, although I'm getting my first tastes. Consider that Druids and Shamans will have new spells post 50 that allow them to get closer to clerics in healing ability. This is a good thing, clerics are far too relied upon (I had tells coming in for groups/resses within minutes of hitting 49th, it was ridiculous!) But now that post 50, when the Complete Heals are supposedly so required, the cleric probably will have trouble using them, and will fall back on those same spells that the druids/shamans have (minus the HoT spells, but regen/chloro offsets that a bit.) <P>Why? Because of the fixes to the Hate lists. I've put in feedback wondering about this before, that CH generated nada for aggro. It put me on the hate list, but it was very little (I can usually sit down next to them.) I have to wonder how this will change the normal tactics, which is fine with me. At least then I'd have an excuse to not be sitting..... "Sit down and med! Ok. *BAM BAM BAM* I think I'll st-t-t-t-stand actually. &lt;Bombil takes a swig of Dwarven Ale&gt;" *smile*<P>Just something that popped into my head. <P>Regarding mana regen? I'd love to have it, anyway you want to add it is fine with me.<P>Defense skills? I don't understand why we wouldn't have the highest of the wis casters, we wouldn't be wearing plate if we didn't know how to use it. I'd say up defense to 200, dodge to at least 100. Why would we parry? That would imply a higher weapon ability (ability to turn others weapons with ours) which we don't and shouldn't have. Up dodge, trust me, clerics are damn good at getting out of mob's way..... *grin* And up defense, my hitpoints aren't that of a warrior or hybrid so not really an issue of being able to tank.<P>Bash? Would love to have it for high MR mobs (stuns useless), but it would be a bonus, not something required to balance us.<P>Stuns? You seem to have covered that one pretty well, the MR in Velious would definitely deal with alot of it.<P>Hammer of Faith? Don't have it, don't care.<P>Bind wounds? Covered in the patch, binding while med'ing post 35 (no spellbook) would be nice to conserve some mana (use Sup or Cel instead of CH for fat tanks. Yeah, that's you Dregg.)<P>Symbol costs? AAAHHHH! Dropped 900pp on gems for a Hate raid, right after dropping 250pp for my 49th spells. I know some Christian clergy take vows of poverty, but leave me some Ale money please!<P>Shield of Words? Mana cost not too bad, needs to be a bit more AC, and shorter casting time (8.0, complete heal is 10.0!!! About 6.0 sounds better.)<P>Mark of Karn? I'll stay as civil as possible. At the same time you nerfed this, you also fixed the haste bug (any item + any spell = haste cap.) WHY did you not fix the haste bug first, and see what effect it had? We have recieved no reason to believe that you tested MoK after fixing the haste bug. Boanerges-CC had a good idea, 10hp per hit, primary only, still advantage to 1h weapons, but would give pally/sk reason to use 1h + shield instead of 2h with a MoK cleric.<P>Fortitude? You hit nail on the head.<P>Summoned Hammers? Make 'em stackable and range equipable, and we'll like 'em.<P>Abolish Disease? RP reasons aside, we can/will use it, and handing it off has 0 effect on shamans. Druids probably should get it as well.<P>Invis? Would love it, either that or make shamans able to make relatively cheap, stackable invis potions.<P>Temple Gate? Again would love it, might actually visit Kaladim some more. Probably about a 20-something level, when folks tend to quit using their home town as much.<P>Lulls? Hmmm, my high elf cleric used them alot, and they worked, but my dwarven cleric finds them effectively useless, even when he gets 100+ charisma. What the hell is it based on?<P>Group buffs in general? Need them, only serve as downtime extenders to cast individually. Perhaps at 1 or 2 circles later (right before or when the next buff is usually available.)<P>Deity specific spells? Only, and I mean ONLY ONLY ONLY if each god has a unique spell that are all relatively balanced in desirability. A really good root to Brell, and Disease attack for Bertox, an aggro reducer/inducer for Inny (Hate), etc.<P>That's about it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wow - ok, a lot of changes made it in today.  Um, why did the first post of spell changes made include Clerics?  Oh yeah, you reduced the fizzle rate of heals.<P>This is pretty sad, you upped defense stats for paladins, shadow knights, etc. - heck, rangers even get to even offensive and defensive skills as warriors.  What did you do for Clerics?  NADA.  Clerics are the MOST boring class to play in the game, and I am sorry, CH doesn't get used that often in post 50 play that I feel "honored" to have it.  Besides Rezing (which Paladins can now do), please tell me what it is that makes you feel Clerics are so unbalanced?<P>Is it because people feel they NEED them in groups post 50?  Again, we are talking Rez, no other reason.  yes the heals are nice, but there are so many other ways to reduce damage (slow, fear kiting, debuffs, etc) that if you took a really hard look at why Clerics are so wanted post 50 it is because of Rez.  So you may as well give that to more classes also, and then the clerics can truly stop playing - there will be no point to our existence, and why the heck would I play a cleric when a Druid or almost ANY other class is more interesting to play.<P>I play a monk now, much more fun - but it sucks that I got my cleric to 54 and feel very little urge to play him because the main things I do are Rez people and buff ... it makes their game more enjoyable, but doesn't change anything that I would like to do with my character.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I haven't read this whole thing yet but as far as cleric I don't ask for much.  Yeah I would like a clarity type spell, pets, turning undead and so forth but if anything I just want ONE spell.  <P>Heres my spell and my reasons and I don't know if this has been posted before.<P>I want an area affect spell that will stop agro's.  Not a root type or fear.  Just kill the agro and make them forget they were chasing you for 5 or so seconds unless you reagro them within that time frame by doing something completely stupid.  A root or stun would be wrong because this will give you the ability to root/stun a group and have the nukers go to town.  This is not the point of the spell.  Its to give you the ability to RUN LIKE HELL!  When your grouped it will give a busy wizzy or dru a few seconds to evac but not enough to polish off the bad guys.<BR>A 2 second cast would be ideal.  A level 20 would be great but realistically it should probably be minimal level 30.  We don't have sow or ports, don't need them.  Just give me the getaway car and I'll drive it.<P>Haldolmer (NTB)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One more thing to add or a couple.  This spell should only be recastable after 15 minutes or more to prevent misuse of its original intentions.  Second, the same concept could be used with a group type Divine Aura that lasts 3-5 seconds with a long recast as well.  If it given at a decent lower level, I just want a decent cast time.  Higher level with a longer time is not so bad since you shouldn't be upfront anyways in a group.<P>Haldolmer NTB</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I still believe that clerics should be the best at destroying the dead.  I propose having a new combat ability called turn undead.  This ability would act just like turning undead in D and D did.<P>As for example it would be an area effect undead direct damage that scaled with the level of the cleric.  It should be able to destroy any Green con monsters that is located in the AOE and scale down as the undead mob lvl increased.  i.e. blue cons take 75% dam, white cons 50% and yellow and red good chance of resisting..<BR>It would also be on a day timer like HT and LOH<P>This would be a blessing for a number of reasons.<BR>1. It would open up the clerics ability to do some combat without infringing on other classes.<P>2. Would be a helpful addition to the clerics arsenal when a cleric is fighting a Necro or SK on PvP.<BR>3. It could also have to have reagent such as the symbol of your god to be able to perfrom- this would tie into God quest that so much of us want.<P>So that it doesnt become to powerful the drawbacks should be:<BR>1. Immense taunt that pulls all remaining undead to cleric.<BR>2. The mobs that it destroys will be green so no xp would be gained- making it advavtages to us it in the right circumstances. such as bad pull or invis fail.<P>Hope this makes it on the list.<BR>Thx<BR>Padren Cleric 20th lvl.. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Something that I didn't see here, or maybe missed.

</FONT><HR>New heals?!<P>Why are druids and shamans recieving better and better heals? Pretty soon, any melee class would rather have a shaman in group than a cleric. This isn't balancing, this is very unbalancing.<P>What would help balance a lot is make mark of karn the same way it used to be. That would keep clerics wanted, and make enchanters less of a need. All the time I am with a group in seb waiting on one class, an enchanter, while there are plenty of other fine classes lfg. Enchanters will still be greatly wanted, but groups would begin to feel more confident not having them.<P>Also, LAG? I play on the rathe server, where it has peaked over 3000 people before, on top of that, the server has been coughing up a lung for ages now. I abosolutely hate when a lag spike claims my group members life. Most clerics should know what I'm talking about, when remedy takes about a 1 min. to cast! It sucks! ;p<P> - Solution: Mark of Karn (old version), while you stand there casting Divine Light for a whole minute, the melee classes will still be hitting the mob, hopefully keep them alive long enough for the lag to go away. Of course this won't help casters much, but boohoo. They don't get hit much during lag anyway.<P>It once was a useful spell, but now the only time anyone uses it is when they ding and mem the spell just to try it out a couple times; Afterwards they let the spell sit there in the book, never to be clicked on again.<P>And if absolutely necessary, make it not able to be cast in places that are specifically for raids, like the planes, heh, I can see how that would be VERY useful there, but really, too useful I guess  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>hmm i seem to post a lot..<P>absor, i know that i have posted a few *****y and somewhat ranty things, but i am curious as to how you see the cleric in the game after this balancing. we are pure healers. that is it. shamans and druids have almost identical healing capabilities save complete heal. they gain the edge with built in mana regen. a shaman with a regen and canabalize has near infinite mana at their disposal, and while their heals won't do as much as ours, they can heal more in a slightly longer time frame, not to mention they nukes and other means of assisting in battle. yea someone has to be the hardcore healer, but it seems that there are fewer and fewer clerics as the job is repetitive and dull. how do you see these balances doing anything but decreasing the already small cleric population?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I would just like to state my opinions about a few<BR>things brought up above. I am a 38 cleric on Lanys<BR>T'vyl so I might not be as experienced as other<BR>people who posted before, but still:<P>Standing meditation: Feels totally unfair to other<BR>classes. You could give the "but we get our power<BR>from the gods" as an argument, but I think it is<BR>still invalid. Maybe we need to be in contact with<BR>our diety to regain our mental strength?<P>Lull line of spells: I stopped using these a while<BR>ago because they are simply too dangerous. I have<BR>attempted to lull lizards in the throne room in<BR>Cazic-Thule twice, and both times it failed and<BR>caused the deaths of several people. I think that<BR>monsters resisting the spell is just fine, but it<BR>should _not_ make them aggressive to us. Even if<BR>it seems more realistic that it would, it actually<BR>makes the spell completely unusable when trying to<BR>break the spawn in larger mob groups.<P>Invisibility: I think it is a big drawback that we<BR>don't get even personal invisibility, but also I<BR>feel that all classes shouldn't get everything.<BR>I have created and administered a MUD, which is<BR>one of the biggers in sweden now I think, even<BR>though I retired from it. It feels like the<BR>biggest problem is to keep all classes separated,<BR>balanced and still useful in different ways. I<BR>personally vote no for even personal invisibility<BR>for us even if it is a big drawback. Keep classes<BR>unique  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Maybe this post will upset lots of other clerics<BR>out there, but personally I feel that my points<BR>are valid.<P>Also, I would like to thank you developers for a<BR>great job balance wise.

</FONT><HR>I skipped through like pages 2-4, dunno if this was repeated, but I like the Prayer Idea someone had on the first page.  Essentially its like Harvest, but we call it prayer.  Takes a Spell Slot, casts every 10 mins and gives around 400-600 mana and stuns the cleric for 10 seconds.  I dont see any wizards soloing Gorenair, so Verant must have done something right with Harvest.<P>I know people will go "But thats unbalancing, clerics are already powerful"  Its obvious these people have never played a cleric.  or they have, but to level 43, and have special insight on post 50 healing.<P>Im 58, almost 59, and I cant heal in Sebilis, Howling Stones, Karnor, Kael, Skyshrine, or Velks Lab without out both a slow and a mana enhancer, or a tank with full cobalt.  Maybe I have bad luck, but I always run in with some half assed ranger with AC 100 lower than me, and I have to chain cast my heals, always OOM.  If having mana regeneration/debuff is required just for a cleric to keep up with heals, let alone DO anything else silly like Stuns or *shutter*, damage, they have a warped sense of "Balanced".  I see druids solo'ing in Skyfire without any buffs from other classes, necros as well.  I dont see wizards or mages yelling "OOM" every 10 mins cause they have a tank thats not in the fortunate 5% with AC of 1000+. They gotta give us this, or something like this.<P>What do they do in return, Mark of Nerf and Breastplate of Nerf.  Cool beans, I saw that coming, can you please at least nerf the other classes too?...*verant gives shaman/dr00ds new heals*.  Okay, how about clerics?...*verant gives clerics more aggro for the heals they already cant cast cause their OOM*..Okay, thx, now Im oom and using another spell slot for 2 invuls to not get smoked by an avalanche Golem.  I will admit though, I do thank you for fixing the fizzles.  That was annoying, casting Naltrons Mark, and fizzling twice, losing almost a bub of mana.<P>As the wizard before me a few posts back, clerics keep raids running, and if no one wants to play clerics anymore, the wheel stops, and all the rangers are forced by their uber guilds to start clerics, then all hell breaks loose.  People CH'ing monks and bards, remedy on warriors, dogs and cats living together, Mass Histaria.  You dont want that, do you, hehe.  Support your local cleric, and give us something cool.  Make it a quest, I will be the first guy in Hate killing a mob for an item for a neato mana regen spell for clerics.<P>Your Bored-out-of-his-mind-with-healing-Templar<BR>Vasdenjas Ghoulbane<BR>58 Templar - The Tribunal<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Ok, I've played a fair number of EQ classes over the past year and am currently making my way through the levels with a cleric.  I enjoy much of a good cleric's duties.<P>However, in all fairness, I was very surprised and a bit disturbed by the recent patch message.  It seems that Verant left all the problems with the cleric class unaddressed.  This might be understandable if Verant honestly believed clerics did not need some remedy.  However, as Absor's original post that started this thread clearly shows, Verant has already recognized some of the key problems with the cleric class.  Yet, they have left all of these problems untouched. <P>Now, as to specific issues.  The #1, big kahuna, monster problem with clerics has to be mana regen.  Clerics desperately need some form of mana regen.  Of course, it should NOT stack with clarity or breeze, but have a similar effect.  It could either be a spell (Divine Faith) that opens a clearer path between cleric and deity or a skill such as an advanced meditate (Commune) that allowed a double-rate mana regen when sitting and sticking one's nose into that infernal spellbook.<P>I honestly don't mind staring into that book and monitoring group HP bars during battle.  What I do mind is that, usually being the only cleric in a big group, I am ALWAYS out of mana, even with very high wis and wis and mana bonuses.  I almost never spend mana buffing and heaven forbid I use one of the dd or stun line spells in combat.  ALL of my mana MUST be strictly preserved for healing.  Faster mana regen gets me more into the game and the action.  I will be more able to use a variety of my spells, because I won't be at less than full mana with every pull.<P>Look, clerics are the big healers.  We all get that.  Just like Wizards are the big nukers.  No one tops a Wiz at nuking.  However, while a Wiz gets a mana regen capability to keep them nuking and allow them to occassionally buff or take on other casting activities, clerics are stuck with zilch in the mana regen category.  From a game-play and balance perspective some mana regen capability for Clerics is absolutely essential.  It is the number one reason I get frustrated in-game.<P>From a roleplay perspective, it is easy to think of clerics gaining a greater connection to their deity through a skill or spell.  I always imagined that a Cleric's meditate was like prayer to her/his god.  Step that up a notch to communing with her/his god.  It only makes sense.  Drop it into play at the mid- to high teens, but definitely no later than level 20.  Meditate times start to be ugly from there up.<P>It can be self-only, so we don't become mana crack dealers like some other classes and don't affect the clarity/breeze economy.<P>Standing meditate?  Who cares?  Really.  That is a waste of programming time.  Help clerics with mana regen.  Before you do ANYTHING ELSE!  HELP CLERICS WITH MANA REGEN!<P>A cleric can live just fine without invisibility, with low combat skills (why would I want to melee?), and without many of the other items listed on the talking points.  However, a cleric cannot live (nor properly do her/his job) without MANA!  Given that the other healing classes have a mana regen capacity and, after this patch, have improved heals, why, oh why, can't clerics be given some mana regen boost?  Isn't that now an essential change in order to restore/preserve balance?<P>By the way, I like the previously posted idea of boosting the healing bonus for clerics from 15 to 20 percent.  That would definitely help make clerics more uniquely valuable, especially at levels below C-HEAL.  However, and once again, this must be considered secondary to a mana regen boost.<P>Seeking mana from Verant,<P>Pat<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First, I would like to thank you for finally giving the Celestial line its own effect as it should be.<P>Second, depite all the mindless and untested flames I really don't have a problem with the increased taunt.<P>Third, I actually like having shamen and druids being able to heal better, even if that heal is horribly substandard. But that's another isssue entirely.<P>My problem comes in 2 parts...<P>Part 1 - You nerfed warrior taunt. This is where clerics are going to be hit hardest. I watched warriors being out-taunted by paladins and SKs. If they can out-taunt a warrior then the cleric class is in trouble. Removing procs as a taunt helped Rangers and nerfed Warriors, Paladins and SKs. I suspect this is where we will be impacted the most down the road. Warriors are already having a hard time taunting as a result.<P>Part 2 - MoK is fixed. Or is it? This is so typical of why clerics get frustrated and subsequently quit the game: we don't feel we are listened to. Did anyone read our concerns?<P>It's like having a pipe burst and calling a plumber who comes in, replaces a leaky faucet, declares his job to be done and leaves with the burst pipe still unfixed.<P>You completely missed the point on MoK. Nobody wanted the resistances changed. What we want is the healing factor restored. As it stands now, the spell returns 80HP/min. A ranger can heal that well. We want the spell restored to at least some portion of its former strength (ie a fixed HP return per hit). Changing the resistances doesn't do anything towards fixing the spell.<P>So please change MoK back to no changes made. Give us back the healing abilities or please don't bother telling us it's "fixed".</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>---<P>ITEM: Standing Meditation.<P>There is nothing clerical about standing meditation.  Asking for a prayer skill (picture a priest on knees) would have been a more likely candidate if faster mana regeneration is really necessary for balance.  The next step would be to argue why faster mana regeneration is necessary to balance clerics.<BR>  <BR>---<BR>  <BR>ITEM: Defense skills.<P>Clerics have always had the best defense of all the "healer" classes because they can wear plate armor.  This is a non-issue.<P>---<P>ITEM: Bash.<P>This will probably hurt clerics much more so than it will help.<P>Cleric tells the group, "Yeah I saw it start to cast Gate but I wanted try and interrupt it with Bash instead of a stun spell."<P>---<P>ITEM: Unswerving Hammer of Faith.<P>Make it exactly the same as the druid pet but make it a hammer.<P>---<P>ITEM: Stuns.<P>Have to /agree Absor on this one.  Make one of the higher level stuns have a lure-type resist rate.<P>---<P>ITEM: Bind Wounds.<P>No opinion here.  Healers are actually using this skill?<P>---<P>ITEM: Death Pact / Divine Intervention.<P>The point of these spells is to rescue the buffed recipient from death.  These spells do not accomplish that in their current form.<P>Solution: When this buff is activated it should do exactly what it does now and additionally gate the recipient back to their bind point.<P>---<P>ITEM: Healing Over Time.<P>There should be two distinct sets of healing over time spells.  Combat heals should stack with the slower paced regenerative spells.<P>Combat Heals: Celestial Elixer, Celestial Healing<BR>Regenerative: Regen, Chloro, Regrowth<P>---<P>ITEM: Aegolism.<P>Make it a group buff.  Fixed.<P>---<P>ITEM: Symbol of Naltron.<P>Going to have to /agree Absor again.  Either double the duration or halve the component cost.<P>---<P>ITEM: Shield of Words.<P>/agree Absor.  "This exactly follows the pattern of the spell line, though, and may not need to be changed."<P>---<P>ITEM: Mark of Karn.<P>Mobs should not be able to resist this spell.  It should also be made slightly more effective.<P>---<P>ITEM: Divine Light.<P>Already addressed in the last patch.<P>---<P>ITEM: Heroism/Heroic Bond.<P>Allow players to click off beneficial spells.  Problem solved.<P>---<P>ITEM: Fortitude.<P>Really looking for a more powerful spell here, not a convenience.<P>---<P>ITEM: Hammer of Striking and Hammer of Requital.<P>Let's face it.  These will never be weilded by a player.  Leave the stats alone and put in the following procs:<P>Hammer of Striking: Strike<BR>Hammer of Requital: Furor<P>...At least these could be given to pets.<P>---<P>ITEM: Abolish Disease.<P>Abolish disease is not a "class defining" spell for shaman.  In fact I think most shaman would agree that even if this spell was a right-clickable effect on a flask of water it would be less of a concern that the real issues in the shaman thread.<P>---<P>ITEM: Invisibility (personal only).<P>Give clerics a fixed 5-pulse (30 second) invisibility spell with a long recast delay.<P>This will assist in getting a cleric past a few mobs and to a corpse or their group.  It also fits in with the other short-duration protective spells that clerics get.<P>---<P>ITEM: Self-only Gate to Temple.<P>Please don't bait the hook if it's really too late for "such a big idea".<P>---<P>ITEM: Lull Spells.<P>These should be resisted like Lifetaps.<P>---<P>ITEM: Holy Armor / Spirit Armor / Guard / Armor of Faith / Shield of Words / Bulwark of Faith line of armor spells<P>Again, let players click-off beneficial spells.  Problem solved.<P>---<P>ITEM: Banishment of Shadows.<P>Use the same component as the wizard spell, Disentigrate.  Opals cost about 20pp.  No other changes are necessary.<P>---<P>ITEM: Group Resist Poison.<P>Clerics have group HP/AC buffs.<BR>Enchanters have group Clarity and Magic resists.<BR>Shamans have group stat buffs and group Poison/Disease resists.<BR>Druids own group Regen, ATK, Wolf, SoW, Thorns, Fire/Cold resists, etc. etc...  /boggle<P>No change is necessary.<P>---<P>ITEM: Root or Mez undead.<P>Clerics are already wizards in platemail vs. undead and have a full line of root spells that work just fine.<P>---<P>ITEM: Deity specific spells.<P>Please don't bait the hook if it's really too late for "such a big idea".</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>POSTPATCH ANALYSIS<P>Right now the strongest heal spell with a resonable cast time belongs to druids (Nature's Touch).  This is more powerful then our Divine Light at level 60.  <P>NT heals 978 in 5.5secs for 400mana<BR>DL heals 910 in 4.5secs for 350mana<P>So how bout making clerics have the strongest healing spell again, since you say we'll remain the best healers. Such as by adding a spell like<P>1400hp in 5.5secs for 550mana<P>I Find it discouraging that right now the strongest reasonablecast time spell doesn't belong to clerics.<P>Yes i've left CH out of this, because its a 10 second cast time, so can't be used in a lot of situations.  This would be a solid heal for casters.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

PLUS they can still regen their own mana that stacks with clarity. and sow and dot and everything else they could do before.<P>the reason they get what they want is cause they ask for it.  and they never say make it hurt us, and take away something we allready have to get it.   <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alright   the current problem  as i see it is this healing nerf . Its caused me 6 deaths  the 6 times i cast cheal since the patch. I dont have a problem with it rasing the hate some. BUT CLERICS STILL HAVE CRAPPY DEFENSE AND DODGE or some way to deal with AOE agro. so once we're agro they try to taunt it off and we die. Thank god for pallys having some form of rez or it would have been a bad CR.  I'm not UBER , i dont have some UBER wacked AC. I still use a charred guardian shield at 57.  <P>So now the first time we heal the tank  ... We Cant Sit and med till not just that mob is dead but all the mo9bs currently engaged. CH is a bigger taunt then enchanter Mez now at least in my seb group. <BR> I understand if you did this to justify the  Melee increases aka dodge , defense , adding parry and bash. and the addition of standing meditiation. But i think you messed up the implementation by not giving us all these increases first. <P><BR>  The only way clerics have of clearing aggro is ATONE  WHICH DOES NOT TELL YOU IF ITS SUCCESSFUL  HAS I HIGH RECAST AND IS RESISTED BY MOST 51+ MOBS AND IS SINGLE TARGET. And since CH will aggro every mob your group is fighting you have no way to adjust the hate list. DA /DB  Help while they are up but waiting 15min between 2 casts of cheal is rediculus<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

But it doesn't make sense to have them overwrite Lich.  And they aren't going to stack with Lich.  The negative effects of Lich isn't supposed to be too easily overcome.<P>Gondil wrote:<P>&gt;"1.

Then try to find a cleric wearing more than the donals arms (which are too common, btw)."&lt;<P>Well, with all these items being so rare, my thought would be then that it is intentional that they be rare.  Keep in mind that items, for the most part, never leave the game.  Things tend to get less and less rare as time passes.

Unfortunately, nearly every suggestion that I've read about how to make it more 'fun' for the cleric ends up make clerics much more powerful, and that's how they are more fun.  That's not what I'm looking for here.  Clerics are balanced pretty well.  There is little need for more power.  In fact, more power would be a bad thing.  I would really like to see some 'fun' ideas.  But, folks, getting a version of cannibalize, while fun, isn't really about fun, it's about power.  I'm all for more fun for everyone.  But we also have to keep the whole balance thing in mind too.<P>Zaldra wrote:<P>&gt;"Sure we don't need a traditional or watered down traditional pet, but this would be a good opportunity for VI to do something new and unique."&lt;<P>This is true.  Though we've had pretty bad luck with fun pets in the past.  I still hear complaints from players of classes that were given the pets that they asked for 'just for fun'.  Once in the spell book, people then start complaining that, sure, these pets are fun but they don't help be fight enough<P>Ok, all that aside, I've read the ideas about a pet that Ripostes for its target.  Interesting.  Might be a coding nightmare.  I'll take any other suggestions for fun pets, but keep in mind, no new art.<P>Grondus,  I talked to a lot of clerics in Baltimore   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>As I said, I want to add fun to clerics, we all do.  But we need to do it in a way that doesn't make them significantly more powerful.  You describe spending most of your time in a group not healing, just waiting for people to die or for a pull to go bad.  Maybe your group isn't taking enough risk?  More danger, more healing, more for the cleric to do.  I'm not saying that this is any sort of miracle cure.  But for me, having a good cleric in the group means that we can take much greater risks than with a secondary healer.<P>Maybe I missed some of the great fun ideas.  That's certainly possible.  Go over them again in a post and I'll look at them.<P>Evolin wrote:<P>&gt;"what about the cleric concerns in the same situation? throughout history the clergy has been givin a certain space when traveling and retrieving the dead. allthough this wouldnt be for the same reasons as the warrior, it would be fitting to have and almost fearful respect of a high lvl priest by lower lvl npc's."&lt;<P>Dude?<P>Sorry, slipped into the Dude-speak that Akriss taught me.<P>I'm confused as to why this keeps coming up.  Self invisibility is on the list.  I don't like the idea at all, not any more than I like the idea that I listed for Warriors.  But it's on the list, what more do you want?  And, well, any class could be put in there.  'it would be fitting to have and (sic) almost fearful respect of a high lvl &lt;insert class here&gt; by lower lvl npcs.'<P>As a final note, please, let's talk about the aggro changes in other threads.  We're still looking at it, and we want to talk about it.  But let's leave this thread for talking about other issues.  Yes, we have to consider this change when talking about balance, and that's fine.
