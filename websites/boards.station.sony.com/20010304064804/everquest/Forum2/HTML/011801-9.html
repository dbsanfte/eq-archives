</FONT><HR>I hate to be the one to say this.  Verant at this point CANNOT fix Lullaby.  If they were to bow under the pressure on this board to do it, could you imagine how many more like conditions would IMMEDIATELY crop up?  Kind of like giving in to Terrorist's demands.  Mind you, in this case Verant is dead wrong.  Even they, at this point, realize they are wrong.  The best they can do is what Abashi just announced.  Boost another song to make amends.  I think we should just be grateful, start offering constructive criticism and direction since we know we have thier attention.<P>Let's comprimise, make the peace, and get our mezz line of spells fixed by enhancing other songs now.  Honestly, I just want to move on, have my Bard work like he should, and go have fun.  Verant is obviously open to enhancing our songs now and I would like to see that happen.  <P>I only hope they don't throw a bone hoping to pacify the barking dog that turns out to be another dissapointment.  I don't think they will, because the uproar would be even worse than now.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>This is the silliest...<P>About bards being rare now, you'll recall there were never many bards to begin with.  Oh yeah, huh, Doh?  And about mezzing, I never saw bards trying to mez past 40 anyway, it doesn't work and gets the bard killed, it's not a smart song to play.  Was this something that all bards discovered yesterday in a frenzy?  Maybe 2 bards with personality disorders quit because they discovered their mez song doesn't work.  You know, not having a mez song at all would change nothing.  They have a mana song, they have their attack song, they have their resist songs, and they're semi decent tanks.  They're among the most valued classes, and if you told a group looking for members, "I'm a bard who doesn't have a mez song anymore,"  the group leader would give you a blank stare and shrug his shoulders because it's silliness is what it is.  All you hypochondriacs/bards stop writhing on the floor moaning and get up and stand on your feet like men.  It's a brave new future so let's all hope for a better tomorrow, I believe in you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I'm thinking that bards need an upgrade as it is all around...<P>Melee wise, we should be a little better..We're pretty much priest classes with dual wield.I think we need a few more defensive skills, or just to get them earlier.Bards are susposed to be notoriously good at getting out of trouble, right?I'm not talking feign death magnitiude here, but something nice besides a dodge that has the same skill cap as pure casters.<P>Lullaby-Bah, I can live without lullaby.I'm 34, I think it sucks that it doesnt work right, but I'm more worried about Pixie Stike..I'm actually affraid what goes on with the testing, because I'm assuimg if they make any changes to the song they'll just screw us up anymore.I think it's sad Necromancers can mez better then bards, while bards in a roleplaying point of view, should be better at putting things to sleep then Enchanters even..I dont care, put a mana component on it, make it equal to the Enchanters mana requirement on it...It doesnt matter, just make it somewhat useful.<P>Selo's-Doesnt break root?Cute..really..let's go and take something that bards use most of the time, and screw it up..I mean, we have to play it constantly for it to work..that is a disadvange over SoW, etc.<P>Mana Song-Bah, that and healing seem to be the only things I have that work anymore..<P>Snare- Really..was it that overpowered?Rangers and dr00dz can susposedly do the same thing we were doing at higher levels...so??Crap, just make it that running things turn around when snared enough that they wont move!<P>Charm-Really needs to last longer..I have an enchanter friend who usually gets bored and goes invis instead of waiting for it to break IN KARNORS.Of course, I'm not asking that we get anything close to that, but just decent..<P> Okay..and I dont really this stuff about us soloing 2 HGs at  once..hehe...I cant do two cyclopese under good conditions...I definatly cant do one...Enchanters can much more easily do this...and it's consitered okay?<P>                              Ltol Moonsong<BR>                             34 bard, Bertoxx</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>It is extremely important that Abashi has realized that an Enchanter can mez mobs and regain the mana to mez them again before they wake up.  This shows that the "no mana" aspect of our songs is not a uniquely powerful bard feature.<P>However, Abashi also said that an Enchanter can mez "one mob" and med back the mana fast enough to keep the mob mezzed indefinitely.  I think it's very important that he realize that "one mob" is not the limit.  A level 35 enchanter can keep 3 mobs mezzed forever; a level 51 enchanter can keep 4 or 5 mobs mezzed forever; a level 60 enchanter may very well be able to keep 6 or 7 mobs mezzed forever.<P>This is the baseline against which bards' lesser mez ability should be calibrated.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I believe that 'nerfing' player characters is counter productive. People play the game because it is fun, if it is made frustrating or boring by such actions then players will leave.<P>The player loses, the company loses.<P>I am not currently aware of company policy or research in to character balancing, but it is my honest opinion that Verant should seek out long term players of classes and ask them about their opinions on in-game changes.<P>Players have a good idea of how to play their classes, and how the changes will effect them. I am not against nerfing if it does truly improve the style of play and makes the game more interesting for those involved.<P>As it is, I cannot see how I could play a bard and have and much fun... Bards in parties I form or join only have the opertunity to bolster the others members of the party or run when trouble comes... I do not think that decreasing the level of bard talents at the moment is really an option, despite the lack of mana drain the Bard faces compared to casters. <P>Plus, there really should be someting to fill the infamous level 49 spell gap.<P>Vassikk Bloodscale - Iksar Necromancer of the Rathe.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I haven't read every single post here, there's way too many, but I haven't seen it suggested.  I think a reasonable solution to the problem would be to add a level 49 song that would be an upgrade to lullaby and affect mobs level 55 and under, or something like that.  I wonder if Verant will be open to that idea.  They can make it a quest to get the song like the other hybrids have.<P>That said, I still don't understand the logic behind the decisions that have been made by Verant on the issue.  It really does seem that the planning and decisions made for the bard class have been more of an afterthought than folks really sitting down and discussion the direction of the class.  I used to think I understood where we fit into the EQ equation.  I no longer feel that way.<P>I understand the manaless casting argument.  I agree with it in principle.  If we have nothing limiting our ability to affect the environment, then we could do it continuously without fear or danger.  I also disagree with it though.  We have such a limited timer on our lull/mez/charm songs that we can not affect the environment in other ways while engaged in that activity.  I think the better way to handle the issue of lull would be to make it so the song must be played continuously using an instrument.  The result would be removing the bard from supporting the group in other areas.  We can't heal, buff, regen mana, etc, while the song is being played.  We also couldn't melee.  Our sole duty in that case is to keep the additional mobs occupied.  That's not anything an enchanter can't do with the net result being zero mana loss (I don't play an enchanter, I am getting that info from another post).  I am not trying to argue with Verant's decision.  I just don't understand why that would be overpowering.<P>That's all.  I'm tired of thinking about it.  I don't want to get my hopes up.  OH, and please, please, please, If there is any possibility of making a level 49 song an upgrade to the level 15 song, please, please, please, remove the way-too-high secondary resists and make it a viable alternative to enchanter Mez.  If it will be highly resisted, than don't bother.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I normally don't bother replying to these boards as they most generally are flame-ridden useless drivel, but I feel the need to at least once speak my mind. I have been playing EQ for almost a year now, most of which has been my Bard, I have finally reached level 22. I know, a year and only 22, I take my time and enjoy the game itself. I personally love my Bard, I play him 90% of the time that I am actually online. Apperantly I am one of the few people that understands that a Bard is a Jack-of-all Trades and will never be as good as any other class at what they do, but they can do more than any other single class. So we cant fight as good as Monks or Warriors, they cant cast spells either. Ok, so we dont cast as good as any magic users, we have better fighting abilities and a better range of weapons and armor. Too many people are obsessed with unlimited power, try relaxing and playing the class for what it is.<P>Diarmuid Blackthorne<BR>22 Level Bard and Loyal servant of Veeshan<BR>Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Last night at peak time on the Erollisi Marr server there were over 1800 people online and a '/who all bard 30 60' came up with 16 bards who weren't /anon.  Is there a problem with the bard class? No. Well, not really. Well, actually there are many little problems with the bard class.<P>But why are so many players upset and quitting their bards over such seemingly minor problems? After all, every class has some problems with it... and it's necessary for classes to be different to promote class interdependence. This must be yet another typical class envy post, right?<P>W R O N G !<P>I started my bard one month after Erollisi Marr was created. In the past year, I've seen *so many* little problems with our songs.  And, like many fine players I've met, I tolerate them.  I work around them.  I laugh ruefully and shrug that something so obviously broken yet so simple to fix wasn't tested, or was somehow overlooked and I keep playing. I love my bard.<P>It has never been an easy class to play.  You don't have power like a wizard. Or soloability like a druid or necro.  You don't have heals like a cleric and can't tank like a warrior, paladin, shadowknight or ranger. I've played all those classes. I know. Yet still I love my bard, despite all it's problems.<P>As a bard, you get nerfed with the hybrids, your songs get broken when caster songs get adjusted, your melee capability is FAR behind any other hybrid's ability and unlike other hybrids, you don't get a full set of spells. Instead, you get one *song* per level.<P>Songs are NOT spells. They can't be cast then forgotten. Beneficial songs only affect group members. Direct damage songs are much weaker than even a warrior's BASH skill. Area effect spells get you killed because your tanking ability is nearly as weak as a caster. In fact, my druid can tank better. Everything about the class is weak to begin with. Yet I love my bard.<P>Why play such an obviously weak class? What do bard's *have* then, if we don't get anything to compensate for the hybrid XP penalties, the weak defensive ability, weak melee ability and limited spell selection? etc. We have our songs. The benefit and bane of our existence. Our songs, the core raison d'etre of a bard, is why so many bards are quitting.<P>Many great players of bards have put a lot of effort into exploring, understanding and testing our songs and they have generously shared their knowledge and experience; what type of instrument each song can use, which songs require an instrument, which songs stack with which other songs, which songs overwrite other classes' spells. The main focus of being a bard, is to use your songs to enhance a group. It's vital to know how your songs can combine, affect, and enhance other classes. Therein lies the reason *so many* bards (and other skilled players who really understand a bard's role) are upset - Verant shows a complete lack of *understanding* about the bard class that they miraculously created.<P>This latest debacle with Kelin's Lucid Lullaby is an issue that has been ongoing for *nearly a year* and during that time, more and more problems with the class have been inadvertently introduced by patches to other class capabilities. These problems *added* to the existing problems with the class which remained unaddressed. And each time a new inadvertent problem occurs because of a patch, many fine bards have put their heads together and tested the songs thoroughly and discovered the problem and have even hazarded guesses about the code causing the problem.<P>Every time a new problem is introduced and old problems remain unadressed, FACTS about the way the songs work have been presented politely, clearly and precisely to Verant so that they can fix the problems they keep creating. And every time, Verant *ignores* the hard work and dedication bards have put in trying to keep this class working properly throughout the changes that inevitably break things in subtle and complex ways.<P>Instead, after many polite reminders, they quickly 'test' the songs using modified eqclient programs that DONT SHOW WHAT THE PLAYERS SEE (eg secondary resist messages), they 'test' certain functions of a song and not the other functions of the very same song (eg see invis), they 'test' the changes in conditions under which the problem doesn't occur (eg lullaby by level 15 bard vs level 15), and then they CLAIM THAT THEY HAVE TESTED IT and that the song is 'working as intended'.<P>All these problems are ON TOP of the myriad of little problems with the class that bards have been patiently waiting to see fixed; missing songs (the CORE of the class remains incomplete), the bard drum animation, BUGS (such as the song that causes a dark elf to lose his natural infravision), and other such problems that have existed SINCE THE GAME STARTED and have yet to be repaired, addressed, or even acknowledged.<P>I feel sad that so many wonderful, intelligent, thorough, polite and dedicated players have been treated so poorly. I understand why so many people have quit playing the bards they love and why some people feel that it has gone too far and they must quit this great game. And like most bards, I secretly keep hoping that someday, maybe someone at Verant with a little bit of patience and intelligence will pay attention to the many posts we've made. That someone at Verant will *read* and try to *understand* what has been written by bards rather than glancing briefly at a post and thinking they understand what was written then proving by their responses that they don't.<P>Paradoxically, bard players have never been a vocal group of people. We generally play bards because we believe in the rightness of dialog and communication rather than making the bigest bang, the loudest squeak, the greatest noise. If anyone at Verant reads this post, REALLY reads this post, I hope they stop and think and try to understand what has been written by so many good people before me.<P>Aanluil Lumiaria<BR>Erollisi Marr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hehe pardon the laughter. It seems that "Queen Verant" has a terrible habit of getting herself confused about Bards. Don’t blame her it is easy to do, as Bards are there OWN CLASS and not a Hybrid as the Queens mouthpiece has stated many a time on this board.<P>Which means if bards are there own class we should not be held to an inferior position as compared to other classes as we should have our "own" area of expertise. As do all the other Classes.<P>Which means that the "Queen" has erred in her thinking that our songs should not be as powerful as those that use mana should. By your own logic this does not make sense. But we shall follow your line of thinking to the logical end.<P>First okay so no song will be as powerful as any spell that uses mana, Next we will only give 1 song per level until level 51 then we will give the bards 2 songs. (Not to mention the lack of a song for level 49) So we wont even complete the bard’s class of songs great. Next we will give every mob no matter what level 2 chances to resist every song and now whalla there you have it Bards are in balance with the other classes. Who get more spells. Mobs only get one chance to resist their spell and we will give the caster classes more items to make it easier to do what they do.<P>First Bards are NOT balanced. No matter how much you stamp your feet and scream till you are blue in the face it will NOT change that fact Gordon or whatever you call yourself. I will just refer to you as mouthpiece of the “Queen”. <P>First you slowed our SOW speed; you limited the range of our single target songs. All in the name of curbing "kiting". <P>Next you make our mez line of songs useless. They are a waste of a song. I suggest that if you insist that they be fine you just ripe the songs out of the game and make some new songs to replace them with songs that do have some usefulness.<P>Also you make it so our chain song works about as good as a piece of twine tied to a charging elephant would work. If you wish to keep this the way it easy then at least change the name of the song to twine song not chain song as the name implies it would actually hold a mob in place.<P>Now to the insulting way you the mouthpiece of the “Queen” have treated the bard class. First when you say  “Dozens of high-level bard players quit over every issue imaginable. Often I think that in cases like this, the player is burnt out and is looking for a reason to bail out or start a new class.” How very arrogant of you to presume you know anything about why people quit the game or there character. Here is a hint “mouthpiece” read the boards people often use it as there last ditch attempt to get a ray of hope that will make them stay and the often careless and blasé way in which you conduct yourself does nothing but chase them away quicker.  <P>Then you wonder why people don’t like you or trust you to do justice or to take there concern seriously. Well its statements like this “mouthpiece” “Evidently the drum animations aren't in, or perhaps we don't have anything that looks like a drum when held. I've not personally looked at the appearance in game to see.” <P>How can we the people believe that you know what you are doing or even how to test things in game based on the previous statement “A player called me on the phone today shortly before I left work. We chatted for a while about various bard-related issues and this is one of them that came up. While he was on the phone I figured I'd check it out. I was unable to reproduce the claim that lullaby works better on level 1 npcs at level 15, than at level 60. In fact, I noticed a substantial decrease in primary resists, though secondaries remained constant, as they should. <BR>In both cases I was able to mez the level one creatures a good percentage of the time.” First “mouthpiece” the question you were so ineptly trying to answer was “Why can't you mez level 1 snakes in Freeport?” not if you can use lullaby on level 1 npcs at level 15. “Mouthpiece” we do not trust you or believe you have the wherewith all to carry out such a test on your own.<P><BR>VIA LA REBELLION!!

</FONT><HR>For those who are (sorry to say this) below level 40, play a bard, and still enjoy them...<P>You really haven't gotten into the point where Bards really REALLY decay in performance vs other classes, esp vs NON HYBRIDS.<P>There will be a time, when you've spent over a year or more working on your character, finally get her or him up to a level you think you've been working for all this time (planes, dragons) and see yourself cubbyholed into one role:<P>MANA BATTERY<P>Even that, when chanters get Clarity 2, they'll be able to do that better than you.<P>Because of your Jack of All Trades Branding, you will NOT be able to do anything better than anyone else.<P>Verant does not understand bards and how they programmed them.  Anytime anything is changed and they accidentally "break" a bard song, it'll be easier for Verant to just leave the song broken than fix it.  See the history of bards.  See how many things were broken as intended.  These little things will add up to later on keep decreasing your options later on.<P>Later on, you won't be able to do Crowd Control.<BR>Later on, you won't be able to pick any locks of any consequence.<BR>Later on, you won't be able to use any mana-requiring songs after a rez.<BR>Later on, you won't be able to use certain Psalms while using a DE mask.<BR>Later on, you'll be not able to use ANY AE's in places you'll want to be.<BR>Later on your Healing songs will be a pittance and probably too much aggro to use during actual combat.<P>You'll be a pretty, mobile manastone.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>For shame I forgot to mention the other thing the "Queen" has done to bard (there were so many) that is the exp penalty. The "Queen" in her ifinite wisdom has decided that not only will our songs be 3rd class and never is as good as spell casters but we will need roughly double the exp to level. Yep mouthpiece of the queen bards look balanced to me. Judging by the way you use the word I think you require a dictionary so that you could perhaps use it to educate yourself on the word so that you may use it correctly in the future.<P>What is the Vision for Bards use? <P>"That's for you to figure out and establish given the tools that we've provided. What is at your disposal? What can you do? Where can you excel? That is our vision for the bard class. "-Gordon. <P>In other words we have no clue what Bards are good for they do not fit into our vision there for they are not important.<P>I think the "mouthpiece" should go back and read all of his post he made about warrior issues. He made the same statements that the warriors were balanced and nothing would be done then bang 6 months later warriors are viable classes to play.<P>Lets face it the "mouthpiece" does not have clue as to how to play a bard and what the issues we face and he has shown no interest in trying to understand the issues instead he is quite comfortable making ingnoant uninformed statements about classes and game machanies he only has an inkling as to what is involved and uses his skill in BS to make it into something more to fool most of the public and the others he does not fool just go away as they are the apparent minority nothing that the "Queen Verant" cant live with out.<P>VIA LA REBELLION!!

</FONT><HR>One comment i have is in relation to Gordons reply that when players use spells in a way different to the way it was "intended" they alter it or "nerf" it to make sure they use it in a way it was intended. Now I have played so many P&P RPGs over my years (god the money i spent on it all, but tht is for another posting area) Those very games, that EQ by the way does an excelent job of recreating, have as EQ a limited number of spells. GIven a limited number of spells a mage being of a more intelectual mindset will experiment with spells to find uses beyond the limitations that would be readily obvious to anyone. EX A light spell creates light, but a light spell casted in front of a targets eyes creates blindness and thus attack modifiers. Now any GM worth his salt in a P&P would celebrate a mage who used a spell in a new way to add to the entertainment of the game. So how is it Gordon that you feel you must be so restrictive with the creativity of the mages. I remember reading long ago of a bug that let one levitate staves to make a magic ladder. I am surethat is gone as it does not keep wit hthe "vision". But, while i see daily players complaining of nerf this, thay have/we want, why is it when a player does not complain but sits down diligently and finds a new way to use a spell and then is told no we don't like that it won't work that way anymore. that is rather unrealistic in a fantasy setting (i know that sounds rather oxymoronic buyt I believe you understand the jist of it) If a player can research to discover his spells, why is it so inconceivable that during his research he would discover a new use for an old spell. Now if it is something that would cause sytemic problems (a dupe or something) the by all means nerf it, but if it is anything other than something that interferes with the game on a global scale than my thought is to leave it and allow the creativity of such spells. <P>As an off topic asside. I do have one slight problem with the idea of banning. In relation to other games on the market, If I purchase a game and lets say kill the good guys or whatever, the producer does not send a code through my internet connection and ban my computer from playing a game to which i have payed for. leaving me essentially with a coaster. Yet this is exactly what you do in banning. Those players that are banned are left with a 40 dollar coaster. Now if I play lets say Balders gate or Diablo II and they decide I am nopt an apropriate online player and ban me. I still have the core game and as such can play on my own (although with much less enjoyment) but with EQ if the CS department decides you have commited a bannable offense then you are left with a game that can now be played on no platform. you are left with the equivalent of a blank CD. With out representation nor a jury of your peers. Yes i believe you know where i go with this thread. As few as the banning crimes are, should not the tax paying (monthly surcharge paying) citizens be allowed due proccess on what is essentially a death setance to something they have purchased, and continue to pay for after the fact for their crime. Is a trial system so unreasonable. now yes there are some cases that are with out a doubt bannable. but as I have seen lately there is much debate as in the real world) to some sentances. when will we as the paying public be ruled as a democracy ond not as a corprate dictatership.<P>Othere than that i enjoy the game immensly and hope to continue playing for many years. (xcept for the fact of missig out on the reduced rate for a kunark upgrade) Keep up the good work, and I will keep playing. Thank you for your time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>GORDON<P>A few respectfull suggestions & questions:<P>You said:  There is no way that we can make a no-mana song as powerful as a mez as good as a spell that uses mana, which is the reason that it was changed to its current state last August or so. <P>Lullaby is NOT very useful.  Oh sure it could have it's applications... like True North or Meliflous Motion, but I'd never use any of them either.  And yes Gordon I am a Bard who excels in adapting to new situations with what I have at hand.  But I'd love to have a better mez solution.<P>If you can't have a mana free mez work as well as a spell then please raise the cost to a reasonable level and allow it to work.  (It may work as designed but it's still not a valid choice given it's current performance vs other songs we have around that level)  &lt;-- THAT is inarguable!<P>And lastly, Bards are a wonderful class but we still have some pretty big issues.<P>*) Some songs still give no message when secondary  effects are resisted.  At higher levels with all the pyrotechnics this means you have to turn off Particle Effects and yet still get no Song message.<P>*) EQ was never meant to function with Bards because you can't even manually follow someone running with Selo's in any Kunark zone due to the client losing the PC target when the Z axis changes, etc.  Essentially rendering Selo's a NON-group friendly song.<P>*) All our song buttons gray out when singing one song.  I can't tell what I have memmed if i'm singing.  Sounds like a small issue I know but you'd have to play a Bard to see that it is an inconvenience.<P>*) And lastly, no VIABLE mez solution.  If you just can't give Bards a GENERALLY useful mez solution even at a higher cost, then say so.<P>I just want to say, even with these issues, my Bard is my favorite class.  That doesn't mean, however, that it's ok to leave them as they are.<P>I know that some issues (like the Z axis thing) are just going to go unfixed because you'd have to rewrite the engine.  This is not acceptable but it's not like you gave us a choice.  In return for forgetting the Z axis thing why don't you fix the other 3 issues?  =)<P>Sincerely,<BR>Menoly Wintersong<BR>L51 Bard Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>NOTE:  These quotes are pulled from Caster's Realm, and as such may have been out of text.  If so, I apologize.<P>Abashi said:<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;A player called me on the phone today shortly before I left work. We chatted for a while about various bard-related issues and this is one of them that came up. While he was on the phone I figured I'd check it out. I was unable to reproduce the claim that lullaby works better on level 1 npcs at level 15, than at level 60. In fact, I noticed a substantial decrease in primary resists, though secondaries remained constant, as they should. &lt;&lt;&lt;<P>The secondary resist remained constant, eh?  And you see nothing out of balance for a level 1 MOB to resist a level 60 player 35-40% of the time?<BR>For *any other* class to get that kind of resistance to *any* spell (or combat ability, for pure melee'rs) would be considered so out-of-balance that it would be given top priority.  For bards it's simply "working as intended"<P><BR>Abashi said:<BR>&lt;&lt;&lt;There is no way that we can make a no-mana song as powerful as a mez as good as a spell that uses mana, which is the reason that it was changed to its current state last August or so.&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>*cough* Stealth-nerf! *cough*<BR>How is it that an AE Mez with a limit of mezzing up to 4 MOBs at once (that was put in at the end of Beta as lone bards had the habit of mezzing whole trains in Blackburrow), and can't be juggled with *any other song* (for the uninitiated, every time the song pulses, it's as if a spell is being recast, ie: a whole new chance to be resisted) be considered as good as a same level enchanter's mez (where they can Clairty/Breeze/etc themselves and med their mana back before their mez breaks)?  Not only that, but because it lasts only a few seconds after you stop playing it, to try to juggle anything else is just suicide.<P><BR>Abashi said:<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;I think that there is little understanding on the level of communications that goes on behind the scenes. Depending on the issue, I may or may not bring other people into the decision process. I was hired due to my understanding of the big picture, being tuned in to what the design team was trying to accomplish. In many cases, I often have a better idea of this than anyone on a large scale, besides of course the producers and lead designers. That is why I make decisions in regard to what issues, for instance, that I'll bring to a tuning meeting for discussion. &lt;&lt;&lt;<P>Question:  If the way bards work is "a mystery" (quote from you) to you, how can you *truly* claim to see our role in "the big picture"?  Not as a flame, but I simply believe your view of bards and bard abilities is askew.  How can you balance something you don't understand?<P><BR>Abashi said:<BR>(Original question: "What is the Vision for Bards use?")<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;That's for you to figure out and establish given the tools that we've provided. What is at your disposal? What can you do? Where can you excel? That is our vision for the bard class.&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>Hmmm... Funny how when we (or any class) find(s) a use for something that is not as intended by the enigmatic Vision (read: FD pulling, kiting, etc.), it is *then* that we get told what the idea for the class is, and how it fits into The Vision(tm), then that class is subsequently nerfed.  We adapt, we overcome, then we get told it's wrong, the class gets nerfed, rinse and repeat.  To me, The Vision for bards is only as viable as they people in charge of it.  To make a statement that bard songs are "ancillary" to the class only re-enforces my belief that you (and possible others at VI) have no idea about bards and our role in EQ.<P><BR>Abashi said:<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Bards are not really hybrids despite having the same experience table. They are a class all to their own. If I had to name something, I'd call them part warrior, part rogue, part enchanter, part druid, and part shaman. &lt;&lt;&lt;<P>*bends over and takes it*  Nothing like being penalized for something you aren't.<P>Abashi said:<BR>(Original post:"Why are bards one of the least played high level classes?")<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;They are difficult to play well, and their name doesn't scream offensive power like some other classes. &lt;&lt;&lt;<BR>and<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Dozens of high-level players quit over every issue imaginable. Often I think that in cases like this, the player is burnt out and is looking for a reason to bail out or start a new class. &lt;&lt;&lt;<P><BR>Partially right.  Most folks that want screaming offensive power won't even *start* a bard.  The main reasons that high-level bards are an ever-dying breed is that yes, we are harder to play at higher levels, but also that VI keeps jerking us around (almost a year for Lullaby, months for Chains, not even a word on Pixie Strike, and has anyone seen my level 49 song and/or my drum graphics?).<P><BR>Abashis said:<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Evidently the drum animations aren't in, or perhaps we don't have anything that looks like a drum when held. I've not personally looked at the appearance in game to see.&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>(Score another one for "the big picture")<BR>This is an issue that has come up time and again since Beta.  Supposedly, we were going to get our graphics with RoK along with the Barb shields, but we still have yet to see them (and come to think of it, there really hasn't been word on it since RoK came out).  Just to make this easier for the folks at VI... There are *NO* drum graphics in the game (aside from the equipment view).  When we use our drums, we are strumming our flutes (??) or doing nothing (Nostrolo's Tamborine doesn't even have the flute grahpic movements).<P><BR>Abashi said:<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Chains had the power to reduce the effective movement of a fleeing NPC to zero, causing it to be an effective root. However, were an actual root spell used, the NPC would have fought having no other option available (fight or flight). It had fleeing mobs at a dead stop, yet not fighting back.&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>Uhm... that's what ALL Snare songs/spells do.  The only difference being that with Chains (since most songs grow as the bard progresses through levels), beginning at around level 39, it could stop a fleeing MOB at 40-50% health as opposed to the 15-25% that it is now (which is the way it works when you first get it).<P><BR>Abashi said:<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Most spells work as intended until someone finds a way to make it work in a way that wasn't intended. People think that new way they've discovered is the way it is supposed to work, so when we make changes so that it only works as intended, it's perceived as a nerf.&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>Correction: we are using the tools provided us to establish our role in The Vision(tm).  Interesting how in an "ever-changing" world, VI refuses to let the classes evolve.<P><BR>Abashi said:<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Please don't confuse 'no' with not listening. We always listen, just sometimes the answer isn't the one people want.&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>Sorry Gordon, but from the bardic communities standpoint you are *hearing* us, but not *listening* to us.  (sort of an aside:  when testing Lullaby, Pixie Strike, Chains, etc, did you folks use a retail client or your own?  The reason I ask is that your version has proven to be faulty in the past)<P><BR>Abashi said:<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;I wouldn't reduce it to that, but bards are indeed supposed to be a support class.&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>And what happens when/if we "adapt", using the tools that you have given us, to become more than just a support class?  I have solo'd most of my 41 levels (would be much higher, but back in early January I deleted then recreated my bard because I had really goofed on my stat points), so does this mean that bards will be getting more nerfs?  <P><BR>Abashi said:<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;They aren't completely useless, just reduced in usefulness once the targets go over level 30. That said, we're not opposed to revisiting pixie strike and twilight to see if they need to be changed positively now that we know that lullaby is working correctly.&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>Try giving any other class a 35-40% resist rate on a spell/melee ablilty for a level 60 player vs a level 1 snake and see how "useful" they feel that spell/ability is.<BR>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<P><BR>Abashi said:<BR>(Original post: "Why no response on these quotes from GZ?")<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Because the quote really doesn't address the issue at hand. It doesn't say whether he's talking about primary or secondary resists, nor does it say what the level of the target is. Based upon some tests I ran while on the phone with a customer this evening, that quote looks pretty accurate for NPCs under level 30. <P>If you would like the full text (plus screenshots) I'm sure Ro-kenn, Talies, Kaearia or someone out there can get you any info you need.<P>Sorry for the long post, but I fully intend to beat this dead horse for the next three months.  Why 3 months?  That's when my current account ends.  At that time, if VI hasn't made some decent amends to the bardic class, not only will I take my money elsewhere, not only will I never spend another hard-earned dollar on another VI product of any kind, but I will urge everyone I know to follow my example.  Perhaps Real-World economics will succeed where words of reason and analytical data have failed.<P>-=B=-<BR>41.6 Bard<BR>The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I don't really agree that bards should have some of the things that are asked for here, but I do think we are resisted way too often, and I think that the main song in question here, the lullaby, CERTAINLY has problems, even at pre-50 levels.<P>The first time my bard tried to use it, all it did was nearly get me killed and taunt everything off the tanks and onto me!  It is a megataunt... and it's not very effective.<P>With that said, I'm very suprised that the very very small number of bards out there have managed to generate such a large thread!  You'd think that this very fact in itself would cause Verant to take the issue a little more seriously...<P>As far as I'm concerned, they can make it not effective at 30+, but make it at least moderately useful at pre 30.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Surely there is another way to balance our level 15 lullaby song besides making it not work at all. The song is broken, it doesn't work in any practical sense in any context I can think of within the game (beyond level 20 or so).<P>The only context that I can imagine you would actually use this song is if you needed to taunt multiple mobs to attack you at once. Perhaps this could be the new purpose for Lullaby. I suggest either fixing it, or renaming it. Perhaps "Terrible Taunt" might work. Or "Death Dare" or "Magnificent Manadump" something of that nature. Change the primary and secondary resist messages to read "YOU taunt a moss snake to ignore others and attack only you." Viola, fixed song.<P>Also, while you are at it, I suggest enchancing the abilities of Enchanters somewhat, further widening the gap between their percieved/real necessity as part of the group and the percieved/real risk of adventuring in kunark without them. Adventuring in Kunark without an enchanter is like the difference between driving a porche and taking your little brother's bigwheel. The only other class that approaches the real/percieved necessity of an enchanter in Kunark is a cleric. Luckily clerics are one of the most popular classes to play and there isn't really a shortage of them. I wonder how often bards would be sought out in groups if we didn't have a mana regen capability or if there were an abundance of high-level enchanters around. Seems to me, fixing the bard mez line - including lullaby - would kill two birds with one stone. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Heck,a Darkness spell from lil ol' 15th-rank Shadowknight me could stop a fleeing orc cold at a certain level of damage(and the darn thing took a few good whacks to KO even then).<BR> <BR>Spells that can slow a target certainly can and do manage that trick. In many cases it's the only way to safely pick off a single target. As opposed to being utterly mangled by a pack of them.<BR> <BR>So bards can't even do what I can do as another "hybrid"? Rangers can Snare. SK's can Darkness. <BR> <BR>And a double-dose of resists for an effect that checks every few seconds to break in the first place? <BR> <BR>Doesn't such a universal expression of revulsion from the dedicated players of the bard class strike any chord here,if you'll excuse the pun?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
