</FONT><HR>"If I could drain life between AE waves, I'd never die."<P>Umm, right.  The Chardok Queen kills a fully buffed caster in one AE two tops, the necro drain life won't save you more than a heal saves any other caster.  <P>And there is also a thing called "mana".  I'm sure you've forgotten, but even with the best necro drain they could only do 1/3 of a wizard's damage for about 3/4 of the mana.  No problem with that, since it also heals, but the problem lies that you can't drain high level monsters, period.<P>"Necros give hp as mana in raids."<P>That would be fine if the mana transfer spells were any good(even a 2:1 ratio would be decent), or if we could still somewhat drain monsters at higher levels.  Thing is, if you use demilich and transfer mana, you're not going to get any of those hps back, and most likely waste a cleric's mana should the monster hit you once or twice reducing your puny hp to even punier proportions.  The one problem I see now is that the mana transfer spells are way out of proportions.  I give three times the mana that the cleric receives? That doesn't sound like a deal to me.  Even a paladin can heal more than a cleric would be able to with 600 extra mana.<P>"Necros have to accept their changing role at higher levels."<P>Does those changing roles make any sense? Are we still playing the same game here? I know that EQ isn't about roleplaying much these days, but a necromancer giving mana to someone else? No, most necromancers are not complaining that we are underpowered in groups.  Most of us are complaining that we are no longer playing the class we started.  This is a roleplaying game.  How can we play the role of an evil caster, the master of the dead, the slayer of the living, the cunning magic tactician, if all we are reduced to is mana transfer? Do you guys get the point here? Necros did not choose to play a necro because we wanted to be a cleric.  There is something called "separate roles" here, something called playing the class WE WANT to play, and that's why most of us chose the necros.  Yes, power is sweet.  Yes, being useful is cool.  But ultimately it comes down to this: If I chose the necromancer I expect to play the necromancer, NOT the cleric.<P>"Necros are the most powerful soloing class in the game."<P>I'm starting to doubt that.  I've seen monks solo the ghoul lord, thieves solo a monster that has 32k hp(assassinate), mages chain casting pets to kill 100% MR giants that my necro would never have a chance of beating.  Shamans killing monsters that summon with a slow and a couple of dots & then melee all the way.  Enchanters charm killing in sebilis.  It seems that the necro is GOOD at soloing in exactly one last area: fear kiting.  Yeah, I'm supposed to spend the rest of my life in Skyfire, I suppose.<P>"I know necros are very weak in raids, but they still can contribute."<P>Herein lies the problem.  If a class is weak, that class will most likely be discarded for a better class.  This is how the higher level game works, folks.  You don't bring classes to a raid because you need the numbers.  Most guilds have the numbers.  You bring a class because that class is useful, it fills a decent role.  Necromancers, being the weakest of all classes in a raid, are no doubt still useful... To a degree.  But that degree doesn't warrant them a spot in the raid.  <P>When it comes to high level raids, the only thing a necro can do is summon their long time friends and guildmates and try to do whatever in their power to not make the guildmates who doesn't know them so well despise them for coming, for creating more lag.  A class that can be replaced to a benefit by any other class is not well looked upon in a raid.  You don't want more people than you already have because the less people there are, the less lag.  If we could fit 200+ people in the same zone without lagging to death, I'm sure necromancers would be invited to raids just for the sake of inviting them.  Yet, because only ~30 people can fight the same monster without all going LD, you need to pick and choose.  Here is where at higher levels most necromanceres claim that they are being neglected.  Not because they don't have friends or a guild, but because the guild doesn't "need" them, and thus it is best that they do not come to a raid so as to create less lag, and more of a chance for the guild to succeed.<P>I think when it's BENEFICIAL for a raid to have only one necro(for summoning corpses & DMF) or no necros at all, that the class needs to be looked at.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Its that verant abuses the "NO TAP FLAG" on 95% of all uber mobs.   80% of a level 60's life is these battles.  95% of 80% means that for roughly 70% of what you should be doing, you are useless!  If rogues couldn't hit mobs 70% of the time, or chanters mez or give clarity (because it was a no clarity zone) 70% of the time, thats the problem.  Nothing to do = boring, = no play = no money for verant.<P>Maybe thats a formula they'd understand.<P>I don't think necros want a spell that will land 100% of the time on uber mobs, I think we want something that isn't going to be a guarenteed resist.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here are just a few suggestions...<P>1. Ignite/Chill Bones: There is no functional purpose for the skeleton effect. The coolness factor fades very quickly, and the effect has the potential for making an epic encounter harder. <P>Solution - remove the illusion. These spells do land on some epic encounters, but they're forbidden because of the effect. With the illusion gone, Necromancers would have the ability to cast DD spells during these encounters. With no functional purpose to the illusion, is there an actual reason to keep it?<P>2. DOT spells: Very simply, corpses still do poof at times when using these spells. This effects not only epic encounters, but really any encounter that may have a desired drop. <P>Solution - With as hard as this has been apparently to recreate on a consistent basis, I don't know what kind of programming solution may be available. If the problem itself cannot be reliably fixed, is there anything that could be established so that (for example) any loot on that monster would remain in play on the ground? That may not be possible, but this needs to be addressed, directly or indirectly.<P>3. Mana-dumping: Necromancers make very inefficient manastone's on these raids for the simple reason that they cannot draw mana from the mob. If this is what Necromancer's are left with on epic encounters, it should at least be somewhat efficient. <P>Solution - if making Lifetaps usable is not an option, could the mana-transfer spells be looked at so they are viable in these situations? Certainly, most would prefer that taps be usable, but if Verant more or less officially sees this as the role of Necromancers on these type of raids, at least make it a viable, efficient one. <P><BR>The first two answer functional problems with these spells. To address them does not involve changing class balance (unless Verant broke them intentionally to prevent their use...I don't think that's true, is it?), it simply allows them to be used as they were intended. The third is a plea that if mana-dumping is indeed what Verant officially sees a Necro doing on an epic encounter, make it a viable one. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well as a higher level necro I just feel i should put my two cents in.  I have never and probably will never go on a dragon raids because of the necro/DoT bug.  To say a classes role changes is one thing.  To give us ONE, fairly uneffective buff, and tell us that is our job is well LAME.  I made a necro for roleplaying, and undead fire power.  Well there are few places to go use that power post 50, and well roleplaying is not enough to keep me in the game.  I will do what most will do which is more than likely quit EQ and find something new.  To say that the DoT thing is to fight twinking is dumb.  A 40-50 enchanter can Powerlevel a char of any class so fast it is not funny.  This is just a bad attempt to curve power.  I have very few issues with nerfs, this is probably due to the fact that as a necro, I have endured many.  Knocking some of the winds out of the sails of a class is one thing, making them lame horses is a totally different story.  Mana dumping is not mana efficent, much like mod rods.  To say that is our classes new job, is not a job at all.

</FONT><HR>   I think what many people are missing is this.  1 through 50, we are damage dealers, we make things hurt, we do that well.  Clerics may only be HP batteries.  However, Clerics have known this since day one, and have continued to play because they like it.  Even the bard that was complaining about being a mana battery, thats what he signed on for, a support class.  I signed on for someone that can kill things, and end up with some dufus with a pet Enchanters hate, a bunch of mana to give to someone who can use it, and a frickin duck staff.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Demrack wrote:<P>&gt;"Ok, so if this is to be our only role in large raids where is the necro mana version of the cleric complete heal?"&lt;<P>Not at all.  There are other things that a necromancer can do.  You all eschew the use of pets on raids, but they work just fine against any creature that doesn't use fear.  And there is Dead Man Floating, summoning corpses…<P>I'm not going to pretend to know everything about how a necromancer works.  My concern here is that some of you are calling necromancers useless in any big raid, when it's not true.  You may not be able to do a ton of damage to the boss monster, but that is by no means all there is to doing a raid.  If you see massive damage dealing as the only way that your necromancer is useful, then that is where we disagree.<P>Musicicus said:<P>&gt;"First off clerics are used in Raids more favorably because not only can they heal, but if the raid goes bad, they can return the exp of the bad raid."&lt;<P>And a necromancer can return the corpses so that the cleric can work…  No, necromancers have as much to do post and pre raid as any other class, and more than some.  And I don't hear most of you concerned with that.  The major concern here seems to be that at the 'big' fight you are relegated to a support role, and you don't like that (and that you're not exceedingly efficient at it).  In other parts of a raid, clearing or recovering, a necromancer is as useful as any other class (yes, even clerics).  I hear that druids are in a similar position.  On a raid all they do is a bit of healing and other support stuff…<P>Oh, and you mentioned DoTs making corpses poof.<P>They don't.  As far as we can tell, it hasn't happened in months.  We haven't been able to make it happen.  At least not on anything like a raid-level mob.  If anyone has seen a high level NPC corpse poof from a DoT in the last three months, please let me know and tell me exactly how and where and when and what.  High level mobs shouldn't poof anymore.  We've coded it so that it just shouldn't happen.  It will happen on rare occasions for lower level stuff, and that's probably not going to change (though we are looking at this whole thing again right now).  But the high-level-raid-boss-monster-type-NPC corpses shouldn't poof at all due to a fix we made months ago.  Don't let that stop you from using DoTs.<P>LordZemus said:<P>&gt;"But let's face it. Yes there is a drawback to our soloing power, and you can't complain of it. First off, having a necromancer or two on a raid is a good safety net. Do you know anyone else who can fd and res? And yes, your guildmates will be willing to let you sacrifice some secondaries once they notice you're the only one left at wipeouts. Cleric or wizard used too much mana? Pump them. Enchanter getting pummeled by a mob? ST, turn your pet's taunt back on (you do leave it off for raids, don't you?) and send it, or cast anything out of the Heart Flutter line, guaranteed to make the mob want to eat you.  Throw a shadowbound out to save that tank, because Bond of Death and Deflux WILL hit every mob except the last one, despite these asinine complaints. Oh, and your DoTs do hit. Try using the right ones."&lt;<P>Some folks don't agree with the idea that a class that is exceptionally powerful at all other portions of the game might have to take a power-hit in this one part of the game.  And it's not such a big hit, as there are still several useful things that make a necromancer useful on a raid.  Thanks for pointing some of them out.<P>GeistTallon wrote:<P>&gt;"LordZemus:<P>I'm suspicious of you even being a necro. Half the stuff you said doesn't work at all, or isn't a viable option 90% of the time."&lt;<P>I'd love to read your counter arguments to those points of his that you don't agree with.<P>Aerik N'Krosis wrote:<P>&gt;"I wish they'd make out pets immune to fear at least (like a mindless undead should be!). Maybe use the owner's resistances for the pet? Or else lower the ubermob resistances now that they can have more than 32k HPs. This way we necros could at least DoT them and make a contribution to the fight that is in keeping with the original PURPOSE of the necromancer."&lt;<P>It seems pretty unlikely that things that are currently immune to spells will be made less immune.  But I kinda like the idea of making powerful undead pets immune to fear…  In any case, rest assured that I'm passing this thread to the team to read, so it's not like I'm final arbiter on anything you all suggest.<P>Mongo wrote:<P>&gt;"1. Ignite/Chill Bones: There is no functional purpose for the skeleton effect. The coolness factor fades very quickly, and the effect has the potential for making an epic encounter harder. <BR>Solution - remove the illusion. These spells do land on some epic encounters, but they're forbidden because of the effect. With the illusion gone, Necromancers would have the ability to cast DD spells during these encounters. With no functional purpose to the illusion, is there an actual reason to keep it?"&lt;<P>This is something that I want to look into further.<P>&gt;"2. DOT spells: Very simply, corpses still do poof at times when using these spells. This effects not only epic encounters, but really any encounter that may have a desired drop. <BR>Solution - With as hard as this has been apparently to recreate on a consistent basis, I don't know what kind of programming solution may be available. If the problem itself cannot be reliably fixed, is there anything that could be established so that (for example) any loot on that monster would remain in play on the ground? That may not be possible, but this needs to be addressed, directly or indirectly."&lt;<P>They shouldn't be poofing any more.  Not on NPCs over 55th level, which would include anything considered a raid-level encounter.<P>&gt;"3. Mana-dumping: Necromancers make very inefficient manastone's on these raids for the simple reason that they cannot draw mana from the mob. If this is what Necromancer's are left with on epic encounters, it should at least be somewhat efficient. <BR>Solution - if making Lifetaps usable is not an option, could the mana-transfer spells be looked at so they are viable in these situations? Certainly, most would prefer that taps be usable, but if Verant more or less officially sees this as the role of Necromancers on these type of raids, at least make it a viable, efficient one."&lt;<P>Changing the resistance to Lifetap is probably not an option.  And making mana transfers more efficient would be a balancing nightmare…<P>Let me suggest to all of you that there is no reason that your role in this one part of the game can't be different than it is in all other parts of the game.  For example, enchanters don't do 'crowd control' on, say Trakonon.  Their role there is different than what they do in, say, Guk or wherever.  I, personally, don't see a changed role in one part of the post 50 game as a bad thing, not at all.  Whether that role is useful enough, now that might be something worth talking about.  But a complaint based solely on the fact that your role may be different at one point of the game than it is in others isn't something that I can fully support.  I'm not saying that it's not a valid complaint, I just think that it's more of a personal opinion than a threat to the value of the class.  And where one personal opinion varies from another…  there may be as many necromancers that like being able to support their group on big raids as a change from just beating things up.  I don't know, and it's hard for me to know.  It's important to keep that in mind during this discussion.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think some of the people reading this thread might be missing the point that the High level Necros are reffering to.<P>Group Friendly Necro:<P>A Necro has many things to contribute, Hitpoint tranfer, Mana transfer,Ghetto Mezz,Damage output,<BR>Fiegn death. We can use all these skills during normal fighting but not for Uber mobs.<P>I have used my Necro as the only healer in a 6 person group in OS at B1 we had a blast. We also used a Bard for the Chanter. My Necro has also been the only Mezzer for Crypt/Emp for a full day without one death. Again was a Blast My Necro is by far the most fun char to play for me until we hit the Uber mobs..<P>Necro Pets:<BR>For the Necros that wont or arent allowed to us your pet for normal grouping. YOu need to prove you can or learn how to control him..He can be used almost anywhere if you do your job and dont take you eye off him.( /pet get lost & invis circlet) IMHO pathing is part of the game. SO if you pet walks thru a wall or paths bad you kill him asap.. That is your Job Control your Pet!!<P>Necros & Ubermobs ( We suck errr Can't Suck )<P>Hitpoint Transfer:<BR>Without being able to drain our target it takes the transfer out of our options.. if we get cleric buffs we could do a 500 point transfer and hope we dont get dotted or AE..<P>Necro Pets:<BR>I well buffed Pet can do some good damage against an uber mob.(Mag daggers,cleric buffs) As far as pets getting feared, I get feared sometimes even with +250 MR it si just the luck of the roll..My pet done run away any longer than most PC's<P>Mana Transfer:<BR>When it is used for Uber mob Raids IMHO it is to slow and ratio stinks...<BR>Example.. Trak raid when the charge for casters is called Trak is dead before i can come close to dumping my mana..Also will add that 50% of the cleric still have Mana..It is not an over kill raid either usually under 28 peeps<P>Necros bring to the Uber mob Table:<BR>100% resist Drains, 80-90% Dott resist. Able to transfer 600 before mob is dead. Some would say well that is 1-2 CH heals.. that is very true, but this is how i would respond.<P>MY FINAL ANSWER IS ...just bring an extra cleric or wizzy to take my spot and let me park my Necro at the zone for Summons if needed ..Mana ratio much better .<P>In Verants Defense:<BR>If you have played long enough you can remember a group of 6 Necros level 15- 18 killing level 35 SG's ( hense the 6 level rule for drain )<P>THey might be worried that we will gather 24 necro's head to OS casty Touch of night two times.<BR>48 TON = 34k damage = Dead Trak in two casts..<P>Necro is very group friendly until the Uber Mob arena. We develop our skills anf Strength to level 60 and cant use our most feared Spell ,,LIFE TAP!!<P>I have openly accepted all the changes the Necro class has gone thru the past 16 months and never complained, Until now. <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> I kept thinking few more level ill stick these spells on those epic or Uber mobs.. Hey guess what ? They don't stick even when your 60.. <P>IDEA!!<P>ALL Uber mobs now 100% melee resist.. New role for tanks= Bind wound all the casters. <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Wow what a full filling thought for a level 60 Warrior.. <P><BR>Thx everyone.. <P>Warlock (sitting in corner wondering who to pump his 1000 mana )<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Infernall - everything posted in this entire thread is opinion.  And all of our opinions are based on our experiences either directly or indirectly.  Some posters play necros, some have grouped with them extensively, etc..<P>You may not like my opinion, but it is every bit as valid as yours.  I feel no obligation to "prove" my opinion to you.  My personal experience/knowledge/opinion is that necros are an incredibly viable class up to lvl 50, and still VERY useful post 50 - in almost any situation.<P>If one person states necros suck, and one person states they do not then the topic is immediately reduced to opinions.  There are no cold hard facts in this thread, even rereading it.<P>Where you feel inadequate, other players have had success.  So now it is a discussion.  If you dont want other players input with risk of disagreement, you would be better off to send Verant an email.<P>Furthermore, whether one is a necro or not, this subject is of interest to many.  Other classes might be watching this to see why (or why not) to invite you to these raids, and if they have anything to say it should be welcomed.<P>I believe the interaction is a benefit to Verant as well who may see merit in both sides of an argument.  They certainly cant try to keep a class balanced purely by listening to players of that class, not in a game based on interaction.<P>At any rate, this answer will have to suffice.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor<P>Your missing the point. Due to your server/internet stability issues you cannot take a great number of people on any uber raid. Your taken by ur value to the overall effect on the raid. There is no point in taking people who add zero value to the raid and only increase lag. Its a well known fact on BB that the Dragons best weapon is AOE Link Death.<P> Your a chanter/bard thats c2 and CC covered so you go.<P>Warrior Rogue is damage and tanking. <P>Wizards only taking IF they have lure. No lure no go.<P>Clerics and Shaman heals malo slow buffs.<P>Druid can land ***rarely*** a fire based DD. Many are told to wait behind.<P>Necro buff DMF and camp. You provide nothing to the sucess of a raid. You cannot hit with dots, you cannot use a pet (even the spec is lame). You camp and use your other box char on the raid. Usually a rogue/warrior. Necros now only attend pre and post raids.<P>But we shud not feel to lonely as in SOV you have added Wizards to the useless list also. If you havent listened to your testers better listen to your players. <P>FIX THE SV'S/ You have eliminated ALLLLLL casters in SOV.

</FONT><HR>Ok, well here's da thingy<P>I don't mind being a mana battery, its fine with me, the thing is, i didn't make a damn necromancer to be a mana battery. Not a lot of people, including me, started necros forseeing that they would turn into mana batterys at lvl 50+. Well,  some people aren't easy going as me, and when they are all excited about getting to lvl 50+ and being respected and powerful, it will be disaster. People did not create necros to be a mana battery, they work hard to be strong and get to a high lvl. What is a tanks reward? superiour skill. Clerics? The ability to heal. Wizards? there dd's. Enchanters? there mana regen spells. Necromancers? becoming a lackey for clerics on raids. You've just wasted peoples time verant, the necro is one of the most popular classes, and if it stays that way you will lose more and more customers once they find out that their hard worked class sucks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>     I am one of those necros that has been able to adjust to many roles. I can solo, I can fight well in a group, I can play mezzer, and I can even play healer if it's called for. Let alone the fact that I can obliterate about any blue mob with my current lineup of dots, I still have a huge problem finding groups, and often just have to solo for my living. Often I am LFG for the entire evening and never get a tell, and get the same amount of responses sitting in the dungeons LFG. It's pretty sad really, and has made me think more than once about completely quitting EQ. If I go out and solo, I just get called a farmer(even tho the mobs are blue.) Verant has made some of the other classes in such a way that a group CANNOT exist without them. Some of the others can just go to hell in the eyes of the mainstream players. <BR>     I agree that the only time a person loves a necro is when the person or group has screwed up so badly that they need a summon corpse cast. Even then I rarely get enough money to cover the costs of coffins. <P>Bonehand Andfoot<BR>52nd Season Heretic of Torvonnilous<BR>Caster of the 13th Circle</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor said:<P>You may not be able to do a ton of damage to the boss monster, but that is by no means all there is to doing a raid. If you see massive damage dealing as the only way that your necromancer is useful, then that is where we disagree<P>Truth:<P>We can do no damage to uber mobs.   Pets don't live past a hit or the AE or just flee, and none of our spells stick.  Sorry what do I have the dozen stackable dots for if I cannot use them?<P>This isn't disagreement.  This is you not knowing what you are talking about.  =(<P>Absor said:<P> And a necromancer can return the corpses so that the cleric can work… No, necromancers have as much to do post and pre raid as any other class, and more than some. <P>Truth:<P>Once everyone has the PoG robes, this will speed things up when you can use the spell (see summon corpse at specific spots only change) and those people are actually in the zone.<P>Let me see...From Kael to Necropolis is how far for non-binders to run so I can summon their corpse?<P>Hate or Sky?<P>Obviously not a well thought out answer.<P>Absor said:<P>Oh, and you mentioned DoTs making corpses poof.<BR>They don't. As far as we can tell, it hasn't happened in months. <P>Truth:<P>You mean the changes you made where DOTs don't stick, some fix.    I can lay the dots on a mob (any mob that they stick on), then Feign Death and let them eat the mob up.  Mob WILL poof.<P>Again, you speak and have no idea what you are speaking about.  <P>Absor said in response to LordZemus:<P>Some folks don't agree with the idea that a class that is exceptionally powerful at all other portions of the game might have to take a power-hit in this one part of the game. And it's not such a big hit, as there are still several useful things that make a necromancer useful on a raid. Thanks for pointing some of them out.<P>Truth:<P>Only a clueless necromancer [or a trolling non-necro] would say such a thing.  I have used every DOT available on the 55+ uber encounters, they do not stick.  Neither do a host of other spells, such as slow, cripple, malo, tash, etc.  So we are not the only ones that cannot land spells on some uber mobs, but we are the ONLY class that can do 0 offensive damage and when a mob has hundreds of thousands of hit points, that makes us pretty useless.  <P>Again you speak without knowing the facts, 2 CHs for a cleric with all my mana and then do nothing else is pretty pathetic...and not fun.<P>You understand not fun, right?  We don't want to play anymore?   No more money for an account that isn't played=bad.  Ask Sony, they have a clue on this issue.  <P>Absor said:<P>They shouldn't be poofing any more. Not on NPCs over 55th level, which would include anything considered a raid-level encounter.<P>Truth:<P>So sorry, not true.   Let me land 8 or 9 DOTs then feign, pet will keep going and all of that is NPC damage because I am not 'alive' for the 2 minutes.   NPC poofs.<P>Absor nails the coffin shut:<P>Changing the resistance to Lifetap is probably not an option. And making mana transfers more efficient would be a balancing nightmare…<P>Truth:<P>Then you lose players.  You lose money.  So make it not an option, and confirm it via any other well known EQ person and I'll be cancelling my account because leveling ANOTHER character to play isn't in the cards.<P>Why?  Necromancers ARE damage dealers, not a bloody mana battery...those spells were added AFTER I hit level 50.   What a deal, really.<P>Same with summon corpse...but hey the spell meant to make YOUR CS job easier by allowing the players to summon those corpses, is really meant to make our class 'fun' and 'useful'.<P>I WAS FUN AND USEFUL IN THE ORIGINAL EQ!<P>/em shines herself.<BR>Soandso twitches.<P>=(<P>100% clueless, hon.   <P>Ayama</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Let me ask you a question:<P>WHY can't drains be allowed to work on uber mobs?  Where is the logic in saying that they cannot.  Is it that the 340 damage per 3 second spell is overpowering?  Is it that the 720 damage spell for 405 mana over 6 seconds is going to allow necros to displace wizards?<P>If thats the belief, lower the damage to 600 damage and add half a second.  Balance the spell to be in line with a reasonable damage/mana/time balance that you think necros should be doing.<P>As for your comment about the role of an enchanter pre-trakanon.  Wrong.  Chanters buff all the time in guk/sebilis, and this is EXACTLY their role at trakanon.  Chanters buff/crowd control.  If you remove the crowd control they still have one of their 2 primary functions.  Look at their epic!  It BUFFS.<P>Everything about a necro is damage, removing that leaves us with DMF (buffing, not a necro primary skill), Corpse summoning (not needed during the raid, only after), or Mana dump (3:1 ratio, may as well get another person of the class I'm dumping).  If you played absor, and said in any well thought out raid "Lets get 3 necros to dump our cleric" instead of "Lets get 3 more clerics" you'd be laughed at and promptly /guildremoved.<P>The issue is, you've changed, or tried to DRASTICALLY change what it is necros are.  And it sucks what they've become.  <P>I'll ask you the same thing.  Since you've changed my classes value, will you please have a GM reimburse me a warrior for my Necro (equal level and equipment)...<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor.. thank you for at least passing on this thread for further review.<P>Please try to understand that Necromancers Class-defining ability is their ability to take hp from a mob and convert it to the necro's hp.  From there the necro can convert it to mana or transfer hp to another player.  <P>If our role on Uber mob raids is to be a mana battery AND secondary healer I could live with that if I could at least land a lifetap of some kind so I could keep lich running and keep up the flow of hp to me so that I can do my class defining ability.<P>The main problem I see on Epic/Uber mob encounters is our inability to lifetap OR bond of death the target.  Lifetap is a very mana inefficient spell compared to any other casters direct damage spell.  Making it have the resistance of the wizard Lure series would not make Necromancers overpowerd by any means.<P>If in verants opinion that would still be "overpowering" then make only bond of death have the resistance of the lure series.  Only one necromancer can have it on a target doing damage at one time, although any other necromancer will get healed if they cast it.  That limits all the necromancers on a raid to about 800 damage every 48 seconds yet allows all of them to transfer hp to other players and keep lich running to transfer mana.<P>Verant gave us two group friendly spell series and told us to get used to grouping.  Hit point tranfer and mana transfer.  We're wiling to do it if you could give us a way to get the hp back and keep lich running.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>When many of you started playing lvl 50 was the max.  Verant never made an promises to ANY of the classes as to what their role would be post 50 because it didnt exist.<P>As Absor pointed out, you are not the only class whos role changes post 50.  They had to change things to make these new encounters more challenging.<P>If a necromancers power (or a mage for that matter) continued to scale post 50 as it did pre50 there would be no challenge, and the game would be completely unbalanced.<P>Im not saying its totally balanced now, but you have to look at the big picture. As it is, classes are stepping on each others toes.  I dont envy them the task of pleasing a 300,000 player base, but all things considered they have done a reasonably good job.<P>If you want the game to be as you understood it pre-kunark, then reinstall EQ without kunark or velious - pretend you dont know there are two other continents out there, and what you feel they owe you will be fulfilled again.<P>OR, you could accept the changes and learn to adapt.<P>This pretty much covers it - the only argument against a change of role that I have seen is "when i started my necro, I thought I was going to be this or that" -  and indeed until Kunark you were.<P>The game is what you make of it. The tools are all there.  If you are not having fun, you have chosen to not have fun.  If playing a different role occasionally does not suit your taste, perhaps now is the time to try another class or move on and be thankful for the countless hours of entertainment you had.<P>And I say occasionally, because the fact is, you do not progress post 50 solely by going on raids.  You will still solo, or group in regular scenarios where you are still quite effective and powerful if you wish to actually gain xp.<P>Of course the real evidence here is the many posts by high level necros who say they are doing just fine - that and the silent majority that is out there playing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
