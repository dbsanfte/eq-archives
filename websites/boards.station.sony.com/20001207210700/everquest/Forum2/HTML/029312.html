</FONT><HR>   To anybody who thinks EQ is a casual player's game: Ahahahahaha! Casual it ain't. The players who ultimately get to experience EQ to the fullest are the hardcore, 14+ hours a day players. You know, the type who have 10 hours to burn in the planes collecting armor. The type who can camp something 24/7 if their mind is set. It's no wonder that EQ's filled with these UberGuilds (fires of heaven, afterlife, blah blah blah) who control the server basically.<BR>   How do they do that? Simple. They control all the raids and all the supply of uber items flowing into this game. If ANYONE wants a shot at those things (and who doesn't), they will mash their lips into the uberguild's [EXPLETIVE] in an attempt to suck up. If you're gonna say something bad about the guild, oh boy, you might as well bend over right now cause you're gonna get screwed by 1000 blind fanatics who all think they got a shot at something grand. <BR>   And who encourages this? Verant. They hang a carrot infront of the donkey (us) and we stupidly chase after it thinking we might actually be able to get it. Yeah, the uberguilds can get the cool stuff. Maybe the [FLAME] can get some leftovers. But casual players get zip.<BR>   Now you're gonna go: "but Ryian, what should be done?" Well, I got two solutions. One: you roll up a female high elf and hit on the uberguild master (who is most likely a lonely male player). Act slutty, emote groans and moans, pretend to strip, forage some naked pics from the net to send to him. Whatever. After a week he'll undoubtedly load his whole collection of uber gear on you thinking you'll give him some in RL.<BR>   The second solution: QUIT. Yeah, get away from this game. You're throwing all your time into this and get nothing but long downtimes and less and less payoff as you level. Screw the carrot dangling infront of you. I don't need it. You don't need it. None of us need it. Quit quit quit!<BR><p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]

</FONT><HR>There's no question that "success" in EQ revolves around building a proper network of friends.  That however applies to those who play 2 hours every other day as well as those who play 10 a day.  Those who play less often just define success differently. <P>I'd have to take issue with defining the casual gamer in the same fashion that you have in your post.  Rather than define it on the basis of how much time one plays, I'd rather define it based on the playstyle of the person playing.  It's perfectly possible for someone who's a 10 hour a day player to be a casual gamer, as much as it's possible to define a 6 hour a week player as a powergamer.  <P>EQ supports the casual gamer just fine, as the focus of the casual gamer is not consumption of content, leveling, and item acquisition; It's to "have a good time", by adventuring with friends, exploring areas, and overall experiencing the game.  Leveling and item acquisition is ancillary to the goal of having fun;  It just happens as a result of their adventuring. <P>-Gordon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Haha exploring areas ... which game is that one in. Sounds like a real neat idea. Hmm maybe thier is one group on my server doing that. The only groups I ever find just want to go camp one spot for hours. We need a Exploring Area Group Looking For Members tag (EAGLFM). And we need it now!!!<P>Or at least a Looking For Group That Wants To Explore Areas tag (LFGTWTEA). <P>Of course even if such a mythical group was to be formed they would all just die within 10 minutes and hate everyone in the group. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I find Mr. Wrinn's statement unrealistic on several levels.<P>a) It is certainly possible to play hours and hours every day and simply fritter the time away.  It is not possible to play a few hours each week and make meaningful progress.  There are too many time sinks in the way.  It takes too long to travel to hunting areas.  Even if you end a session in the place you plan to hunt in next session there is no guarantee that it will be possible for you to do so upon your next login (the area may be camped, overcrowded, etc).  If you are not playing one of the annointed solo classes then you will have to find a group, which takes more time (and invokes any number of possible difficulties; I'm sure we all have our horror stories about pickup groups).  One corpse recovery will end your night, and no, such a player can't get someone to resurrect him because he's a casual player who doesn't have a guild backing him up.  Spawn rates and drop rates are too low for anyone who does not commit large blocks of time to the game to have a reasonable chance of acquiring desired or, in the case of fighters, needed items.  <P>b) The 'casual gamer' is *not* supported, because the game consistently caters to the higher levels.  Apropos: recent statements from Mr. Wrinn on the issue of required levels for Velious that 'lower levels are transitional', and of the recent Halloween events (particularly the unleashing of Faydedar in Lake of Ill Omen) that 'lower level PCs are the victims that need to be saved'.  The low to mid-level player is thus left rather justifiably feeling that he is being left out, and that he is regarded as a second-class citizen (even a 'victim'...as a GM of nearly 25 years experience I can tell you that a good GM never casts the PCs as victims, it's just not fair to them).<P>c) Progression past the mid-levels requires taking part in organized raids on tough areas of the game; this in turn means the player must be able to schedule his real-life commitments around game concerns like spawn times of rare mobs.<P>Certainly one could *define* a casual player as someone who is satisfied just hanging out and shooting the breeze with online acquaintances, but that's not a satisfactory definition.  The simple fact is that the vast majority of players expect to get something more than a chat room with graphics.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

There are too many time sinks in the way. It takes too long to travel to hunting areas. Even if you end a session in the place you plan to hunt in next session there is no guarantee that it will be possible for you to do so upon your next login (the area may be camped, overcrowded, etc).<P>So then you... travel to an unpopulated area with lots of mobs.  Plenty of places that rarely have more than one group in them.<P>&gt;&gt;If you are not playing one of the annointed solo classes then you will have to find a group, which takes more time (and invokes any number of possible difficulties; I'm sure we all have our horror stories about pickup groups). <P>You'll notice he said a network of friends.<P>&gt;&gt;One corpse recovery will end your night, and no, such a player can't get someone to resurrect him because he's a casual player who doesn't have a guild backing him up. <P>Nothing stops a casual player from having a guild.  Plenty of casual player guilds exist.  Very few powergamer ones do.  Also, most casual players are low level.  It doesn't take much time to remake your xp at those levels.<P>&gt;&gt;Spawn rates and drop rates are too low for anyone who does not commit large blocks of time to the game to have a reasonable chance of acquiring desired or, in the case of fighters, needed items.<P>HG's spawn just fine.  $$$ can buy pretty much anything you want.  For planar armor, you have a point.  But that's 46+... and the likes of sebilis and karnor's offers improvements in other areas.<P>&gt;&gt;b) The 'casual gamer' is *not* supported, because the game consistently caters to the higher levels. <P>GM events are pretty rare.  Most players that are smart run away from them.  Incidentally, these gm events have nothing to do with supporting the low or high levels.  There are low level gm events... they just don't draw as much attention as the high level ones.  A dragon is a bit more newsworthy than a few faeries.<P>&gt;&gt;c) Progression past the mid-levels requires taking part in organized raids on tough areas of the game; this in turn means the player must be able to schedule his real-life commitments around game concerns like spawn times of rare mobs.<P>No it doesn't.  You don't have to ever kill a dragon.  You may want to... but you don't need to.  You don't have to raid the planes... though you may want to.  These are things you do for fun.  That's all.  These typically don't advance your character (gee, 40 players, mob drops 2 things) and will typically cost you xp instead of gaining you xp.<P>Some of the best times I've had in EQ were when I was young and I didn't worry about equipment, when we didn't know jack and were new in the world.  I think most long term players will tell you that they miss when they first started, when the world was new, everything was unknown and we ran around in cloth.  Now I know a lot of new items and I think junk.  I know too much, have experienced too much, and I know I can acquire most of the high end items.  But I miss those innocent 10's, 20's and 30's.  And I think that overall, the game would be better with no spoiler sites, no sites listing info like allakhazam's, eqlizer, and the like.<P>I think Abashi has the right of it... if you aren't a powergamer (or can't afford to be because of time), don't try to be.  I think the casuals can be happy.  I think the powergamers can be happy.  I think it's the time starved powergamers... they're the ones that are stuck.  They want to be powergamers but they just don't have the time for it.  They compare themselves to others... instead of focusing on fun.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What Abashi writes might be his real opinion...<BR>But it is very possible also, that this is Verants opinion.<P>And of course, every opinion has a right to exist (okay, nearly every opinion, let's not talk about some ethnical things, relegion and politics and so on...) when you can give good reasons.<P>Abashi did give some good reasons from his, ack, Verants point of view.<P>We players get the first problem with this opinion when we compare.<P>Comparing is a function in human mind that can change opinions.<P>I would like to compare EverQuest with the upcoming Ultima Online 2 (UWO)... this is deadly for EverQuest when we talk about the casual gamer.<P>In UWO you get power very fast in low lvls.<BR>When you reach higher lvls your power will not grow much compared to your first levels.<BR>This way you and your friends get very fast lvl 25.<P>When your friends only play at the weekends and you do it every day there is no problem. You two still can group without problems.<P>A lvl 55 warrior will have a hard fight against a lvl 40 warrior. In most cases the lvl 55 warrior will win. But he can't make too many mistakes or he will die.<P>Yep, in EverQuest every lvl means enormous power.<P>In UWO there will be a good balance about things you can solo. Origins "Vision" is to encourage grouping (the hardest mobs can only be killed by good groups) but to keep in mind that you can log on every time you want.<P>What? No friend is online? Hey, no problem man, play solo today..<BR>Of course you will advance a bit slower when soloing. But you WILL advance and get exp even when your friends are not online.<P><BR>Comparing these two games can help us to build our own opinion about "casual player games".<BR>Of course, as long as Verant does not have another opinion about their game (powergamer only) Gordon will always say it is a casual gamer game.

</FONT><HR>This is really about how you define a casual player.<P>I am a casual player.  Because I don't play that much, I don't expect much.  If you play only a few hours a week you really can't expect to obtain high levels.  This is true in any game.  And you wouldn't expect to be paid as well at work if you only showed up fifteen hours a week, nor would you expect to be a highly ranked tennis player if you only played every ten available tournaments.<P>Gordon is right.  Your play-style isn't determined by your play time.  If you are a casual gamer you don't play a lot because playing EverQuest is a low priority thing in your life.  That's a casual gamer.<P>Someone that plays very little because of time restrictions in their life (like working 60 or 70 hour weeks) may or may not be a casual player, depending on their desire, not their time played.<P>A time restricted non-casual gamer will most certainly be frustrated with EverQuest because they can’t get the stuff that they want.  A casual gamer knows that they aren't going to get what they want because they just don't play much.  A casual gamer has no problem letting a year real time pass, while only having 15 days played on their character, before gaining a certain level or a certain item because they are playing casually.  A time restricted non-casual player will be frustrated at the lack of progress.  But their frustration is not really with EverQuest.  Their frustration is with their limited time to play.<P>Yes, EverQuest rewards players for the amount of time they play.  That's how an advancement system works.  The same is true of any game with such a system.  Quake (to use the most common comparison) does not have an advancement system, so you are not rewarded by the game for time played (though you will likely improve in skill as time goes on).  But in, for example, D&D your character advances over time.  The same thing goes for all persistent games.<P>Let me address Venture's points:<P>&gt;"a) It is certainly possible to play hours and hours every day and simply fritter the time away. It is not possible to play a few hours each week and make meaningful progress. There are too many time sinks in the way. It takes too long to travel to hunting areas. Even if you end a session in the place you plan to hunt in next session there is no guarantee that it will be possible for you to do so upon your next login (the area may be camped, overcrowded, etc). If you are not playing one of the annointed solo classes then you will have to find a group, which takes more time (and invokes any number of possible difficulties; I'm sure we all have our horror stories about pickup groups). One corpse recovery will end your night, and no, such a player can't get someone to resurrect him because he's a casual player who doesn't have a guild backing him up. Spawn rates and drop rates are too low for anyone who does not commit large blocks of time to the game to have a reasonable chance of acquiring desired or, in the case of fighters, needed items."<P>In those few hours each week you make just as much progress as anyone else does in those few hours.  If it took you X amount of time to run to a hunting spot, it will take just as long for someone else to run to that spot.  If it's camped when you get there, it would be camped for the other guy too.  So you both spend another X minutes running elsewhere.  Just because one player needs one week real time to do that running due to limited play time and the other might do it in one night does not mean that we are punishing the player with limited play time.  I accept that getting into a group is added time for each log in.  But corpse recovery takes the same time for every one.  As a casual player, I had a guild backing me.  I never lacked for assistance when I needed it because we were organized casual players, choosing to play at about the same time every week.<P>&gt;"b) The 'casual gamer' is *not* supported, because the game consistently caters to the higher levels. Apropos: recent statements from Mr. Wrinn on the issue of required levels for Velious that 'lower levels are transitional', and of the recent Halloween events (particularly the unleashing of Faydedar in Lake of Ill Omen) that 'lower level PCs are the victims that need to be saved'. The low to mid-level player is thus left rather justifiably feeling that he is being left out, and that he is regarded as a second-class citizen (even a 'victim'...as a GM of nearly 25 years experience I can tell you that a good GM never casts the PCs as victims, it's just not fair to them)."<P>As a GM for only 20 years, perhaps my opinion isn't as valid as yours in this.  But being a victim is FUN!  I know you won't believe this, but my group gets a kick out of roleplaying all sorts of situations.  Sure, being trounced isn't something that we enjoy all the time, but that doesn't mean that it's not an interesting role.  And you are also ignoring the many lower level events that happened on Halloween.  Faydedar was not the only creature abroad that night.<P>As for Velious, as EverQuest continues, the average character level is going up.  We provided a lot of content for low level characters to start out because that's where the average player was.  As they play longer they gain levels.  Velious provides content for an aging population (not that we're getting old…).  In an overall game sense, the lower levels are transitional.  That does not make them worthless or ignored.<P>But none of this is related to 'casual' gamers.  It does relate to time starved non-casual gamers.  I would tell them that they should be glad that this content will be there when they arrive at that level.<P>&gt;"c) Progression past the mid-levels requires taking part in organized raids on tough areas of the game; this in turn means the player must be able to schedule his real-life commitments around game concerns like spawn times of rare mobs."<P>True, at least in part.  You can progress past the mid levels without ever going on a 'raid'.  Rare mobs are not the main source for level advancement in EverQuest.  But if you want that one item that is super powerful or whatever, yes, you will have to join a 'raid' type group.  I argue that a casual gamer won't care about that one item, or will understand that it is beyond easy reach.  A time starved non-casual gamer will have to make time for it.<P>Yes, players with less time will be limited in their advancement per week.  But if you look at total time played (without looking at the real-life time expended to gain that time played) I think that you will see that the casual gamer advances nearly as fast as anyone else (though casual gamers are also less likely to be concentrating on advancement).  And a casual gamer has fun doing it.  It's the time starved gamer that has trouble, and that's because of their desire to have more play time more than it is due to EverQuest itself.<P>  Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>2 things:<P>- I think that the design of the game does not encourage the kind of play the Vision supports. It is almost impossible to find a group or 2 of people willing to explore a dungeon they don't know. (I have suddenly an Idea! Would it be possible that a group can only get xp from the first 3 Mob they kill from the same spawn point? It will not solve the problem of under-killing and camp for items, but it can encourage people to move around and not to stay at the same place endlessly).<P>- I belive that someone can actually explore when playing 6 hours a week only if he plays this 6 hours in a single session. You are a melee class and you die? It can take you ages just to come back in the zone you died. Add to this the time needed for the corpse recovery..... And if you don't know the dungeon you are in, and if you are actually in the level range of the dungeon, there are many chances that you will die at one point or another...<P>Szlia<BR>Lanys</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>So, Abashi, how is a 2 hour, every other night casual player supposed to get into dragon runs / plane raids, camp spawns for quests that spawn every 8 hours, etc?  I have seen 1 suggestion that allows casuals to do some of the quests by making a second way of finishing it through more steps of smaller chunks.  I would rather camp 10 different 1 hour spawns than an 8(or more) spawn.  Do a log in poll sometime, and find out how many "casual" players there are.... </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have to take exception to VI's statement of what a casual gamers is and what they can expect. I'm a casual player. Why because I don't have long periods of time to put in to the game straight with no break to do other things that I need to do. Like what work or other things that need doing in my daily life. I don't have the problem with taking longer time period to level to the high levels if I play less each day. What I have problems with is the not being able to go certain places and experience the whole game because I can devote 8 or 10 hours straight to the game or don't have the time to get regular groups when I'm playing fewer hours so I end up playing a solo character up to 51 then I can't go to any of the higher level places because I don't have a group. If I play a solo character and get to level 51 I should be able to solo the rest of the way. The game has changed drastically at the over 51 levels to a completely different game and after we have put so much time into it now we fine were stuck. I can see why the original poster posted what he did. I also don't think you can redefine what someone says in a different way and think people are going to change their mind because of it. I don't like be told after buy two games the original and kunark that now I have to expect less than someone that can play all day. I don't mind putting in the same total hours to reach a level or goal but I do resent being told I can't expect to do everything eventually because I dont' play long hours each day. You can try to change the words anyway you want but you will never convince me your right. That I should be happy to be a second class player but pay the same money.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yes, EverQuest rewards players for the amount of time they play. <BR>==================================================<P>See here's where the disagreement lies. The word "play." You define it as the sum total of buying food, zoning 3 times, waiting for the boat, taking the boat, zoning 3 more times, getting bound, running to the hunting area, finding a group and killing mobs.<P>Whereas alot of people (myself included) define play as "killing the mobs." The rest is basically just BS that you have to go through in order to play.<P>I've been to Lguk a hundred times. Running across 3 zones to get there just isn't considered "playtime" for me. When I'm sitting there for 2 hours shouting for a group and mindlessly killing greens for money, that's not playtime.<P>I mean once you've been across Antonica a few hundred times, it becomes a chore rather than an adventure.<P>When players refer to "timesinks" this is what they're talking about. The stuff you HAVE to do in order to do the stuff you WANT to do.<P>Look maybe I'm not playing the game the way it's intended but for me it's fun to hop into the game, get in a group fast, and kill non-stop for the next 4 hours. When this sort of rare blessing happens, I logout content and happy.<P>Sure it's nice to have the loot and exp from that much killing, but that's not what I'm about. I like the action, I like the tactics involved in killing lots of mobs fast. It's a mental challenge I enjoy.<P>But more often than not I find myself caught up in useless BS that I need to deal with in order to play (as I define play.) Bind here, run there, get food, run back, get gems, run there, bind, invis, run down, zone zone zone zone, make pet, shout for group.<P>In the back of my mind I'm screaming "CAN I JUST PLAY THE DAMN GAME ALREADY!!!"<P>And you folks at VI don't make it any easier for me (and people like me) to get playtime (again, as I define play.)<P>No, I don't expect EQ to suddenly turn into medieval Quake. Yet at the same time, I'm not into "heart to heart talks" either. I don't want to pretend to be someone's friend just because she's a druid and can port me around.<P>I don't want to take people out of their way just to help me get my corpse. That's not what friends are for. Friends are people that you like whether or not they're useful to you.<P>So please, for the love of God, could you cut down some of the BS for those of us that don't find it interesting to run across oasis for the 1800'th time? The timesinks aren't challenging me, they're not entertaining me, they're not taxing my abilities, they're just keeping me from where I want to be.<P>Salian<BR>45 Mage<BR>E.Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, lets take a few quotes here and debate them.<P>Abashi:<BR>"There's no question that "success" in EQ revolves around building a proper network of friends."<BR>Very very true. But it is nigh impossible to build that network of friends when the poeple you are playing with today will be 5 levels ahead tomarrow, and 10 by next week.<P>"Those who play less often just define success differently."<BR>Myth. There may be a different outlook overall, but success in EQ means levels and loot. Nothing more. Yes, one can have a fun time, and enjoy themselves, but that dont mean squat if the poeple you are doing that with are 10 levels higher than you next week. That means finding different poeple to play with next week. Real hard to build that network of friends when you dont play with anyone more than once or twice.<P>"EQ supports the casual gamer just fine, as the focus of the casual gamer is not consumption of content, leveling, and item acquisition"<BR>Then why decry the non-highbies as "transitional levels". I wont go into the obvious, that EQ is, will be, and always has been designed, tuned, and tweaked solely to make it prgressively harder. I honestly dont feel that VI understands just how badly this philosphy CRUSHES poeple that dont play  all the time, or have 50+ toons. I also dont think they honestly care at all.<P><BR>Absor:<BR>"But being a victim is FUN! I know you won't believe this, but my group gets a kick out of roleplaying all sorts of situations."<P>I can agree to this, on a stand a lone basis. However, this brings us to :<P>"Sure, being trounced isn't something that we enjoy all the time, but that doesn't mean that it's not an interesting role."<P>I submit that since the socalled casual gamer takes 6 or 8 months to get to where the hardcore players get in 1, that the casual player is the "victim" the VAST majority of events. Say there is your typical slaughterfest on monday in january. 20 level 20's and down die, 7 of whom are hardcore players, 13 casual ones.<P>6 months later....<BR>the same group of players gets into yet another slaughterfest. of those original 20, the 13 casual s all die, being in the 25-30 range. 5 of the 7 hardcore players take part, manage to avoid death but do nothing really. the other 2 get the loot, the rewards and the glory.<P>6 months later....<BR>the same group of players gets into the latest slaughterfest. Now the casual players have attained 35 or so. the hardcore poeple are in the 50's. the under 35's die horribly, because the slaughterfest is designed to have victims. and the 50+ folks get the loot, rewards, and glory.<P>see a pattern? It is VERY REAL. It is even hinted at in your posts Abashi. That the game evolves, and continually is made to challenge an ever-increasing supply of highbies. So where do the guys that never reach the 40's, much less the 50's fit in?<P>Tell me, how are they supposed to feel that EVERY TIME they are the victim so some highbies get to be the hero?<P>Another quote:<BR>"But none of this is related to 'casual' gamers."<P>It most certainly does. It is the same game, the same servers, and the same zones. How does it not affect the 30th level player of a year and a half that is in the same zone as the 56th level player of a year and a half?<P>"I would tell them that they should be glad that this content will be there when they arrive at that level."<P>This is like the owner of a basketball court in the local neighborhood telling all the kids around that they should feel lucky he lives there, so they all could use his court. My god, the old "take my ball and go away" philosophy.<P>"I argue that a casual gamer won't care about that one item"<BR>To put in one word : HORSEPUCKY.<BR>EVERYONE and I mean EVERYONE, likes to have nice things, luxuries, etc. How badly they want it defines how badly they work for it, thats the ONLY difference. I would argue that EQ is a *loot driven game*. And to say that anyone wouldnt care if they dont get items, is well, ludicrous.<P>A quote:<BR>"A company's best resource of information is it's most dissatisfied customers"<BR>-Bill Gates<P>gee, you think the world's richest businessman may know a thing or two?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Tiervalen your my hero. I agree with all the stuff that i read. Frankly i skimmed but my philosophy is realism. I love Venting. Ryian is right. On a server there are a few uber guilds that control alot of things and like Tiervalen said, dont bash the customer for his opinion because most likely there are alot that feel the same way. Most of these problems arise from smaller stressors but all in all you have to tell yourself... its a game, ppl are @$$holes. <P>Fourtunately im in a uber guild and we have learned to share with the other uber guilds our raid times.<P>To get to the main post, casual gamers. Casual gamers dont post on message boards. Casual gammers dont hunt online looking for quest solutions. Casual gammers dont play EQ and if they do they quit. Not all of course but i bet if Verant looks at its total sales of its game up till now and then looks to see if that many are paying, i would be amazed. I bet its not meeting its quota. Why else are there so many patches and changes EQ? Would you still play if Kunark didnt come out till the end of this year instead of begginning of it or knowing that the Vellious wouldnt launch till december 2001? Most likely you would still play. Let me tell you what casual gamers play. If they are somewhat excited about gaming they will dig into an small RPG and beat it within a couple months (as in get to the ending). That IMO is as far as casual goes. <P>Casual - To engauge in ones free or unschedualed time.<P>Hardcore gammers spend time they dont have gaming. Hardcore gamers will substitute lack of diet for a level or two. Non-stop and truly Everquesting. Hardcore gammers grew up playing FF1-8 and Might and Magic and showing off thier insane charecters that took them months and months to hone and sharpen to a perfection. Gamers are perfectionists in a sureal world. You have to admire the drive and goal settings they obtain through tireless efforts. When a gamers goal is accomplished that dosent mean its over. That was the one time run through to see what mistakes you made so that this next time you can do it again with more accuracy and the quest to be truly "Uber". When a gammer can have a moment of accomplisment is when this line seams to fall out as a short breath...  "Damn, im the ****." Thats what we go for. Untill everything has been stomped, beaten, broke, smashed, destroyed and looted... and i mean Everything, thats when a game has been beaten and if this isnt your Goal. Your just a casual gamer.

</FONT><HR>First of all, EQ is not for the casual gamer.  Unless you like to stay at lower lvls.  It would be very difficult almost virtually impossible for a 6 hour a week lvl player to get to sixty.  Unless they did it all at one time.  First of all, most of the better items in the game are no drop and require quests in which to get.  Someone who plays less than 6hours a week would find it almost impossible to get say journeyman boots, since the camp is usually a 12 hour plus camp.  Most of the higher end items are designed in this fashion.  I have heard camps of equipment lasting past the 24 hour mark of continual camping.  Might as well forget that item casual gamer.  <P>No Everquest is designed to pull the player in and force them to play more and more to get items thereby getting their drive to get more items higher and higher, to the point where it takes up most of their time.  I am probably a mid power gamer about 30 hours a week, and I have trouble camping some items, usually having to save them til the weekend where I can put in 8 to 10 hours on a camp.<P>  No if you are a casual gamer, EQ wouldnt be for you.  If your goal is leveling, consider this, it would take you a few weeks to get just one bubble of exp above lvl 50.  It would literally take you several years to get to lvl 60.  If your goal is solving quests, consider this, most of your better quests require higher levels to complete so your going to have to play a year or two before you are high enough to do any decent quests.  Then you wont be able to camp the items cause you dont play long enough to get that rare spawn item.  <P>Finally if your goal is exploring and having fun, ok that is fine, go out by your game at Staples or walmart, make a player, spend two weeks exploring the zones you can get into.  Remember it takes you a long time to lvl and most zones you can forget about roaming in until you get to a higher lvl.  So you will have limited zones you can roam in, about two weeks worth of exploring will do it, then just before the 15 days are up close your account and return it to where you bought it, Staples will take things back up to 2 wks after you bought it without question.  That way you dont spend any money since you got your money back from the store you bought it and no fee is charged for the first month.<P>  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Why don't people that are frustrated with the game quit? Or at least find a reason to be happy with it? If you are time starved, then this game is not for you. Period. You are just making yourself more frustrated trying to change what this game is not to you.<P>I have to change my playing style depending on what is going on in my life in order in enjoy EQ. When I have the time, I will devote a lot of time in EQ and enjoy it. When I am time starved, I will play when I can and do things that will still enable me to enjoy it. If I was getting no satisfaction from this game I would no longer play it. Why would I?<P>In my experience, RPG has been a time devoted thing. If you do not have the time others that do AND will obtain things you cannot. Your friends will move past you.

</FONT><HR>Umm Absor, not trying to pick a fight here but this is a video game not the Pro tennis tour which encompasses entire lives.<P>The entire fault in both yours and Abashi's thinking is that talent makes no difference in Everquest.  Its Work; leveling.  A monkey pressing the right buttons can level as fast as a casual player playing Seven hours a week.<P>Your response:  Well they cant build relationships<P>Thats nonsense, by definition a "Casual" player isnt in this to make long standing friendships thus Casual.<P>Exploring?  please, there are no mystery to this game that cannot be explored on the net.  If you believe otherwise please enlighten.  Ive been here for 2 years now almost and I can empathize with the newer players.<P>You cant walk 10 feet in Kunark as a lvl15 and under without aggroing something.  Same goes for the majority of zones.  Then what do you get for exploring?  Corpse recovery in an unknown zone and hours of frustration which for some reason is defined as fun.<P>You promote exploring?  Then why is it that the best eye candy is in the most dangerous places?  You need to be level 46 to go "Exploring" in the God's worlds.  Thats not a promotion of exploring thats a promotion of leveling.<P>Unless "Exploring" means seeing every nook and cranny of your starting city in which case Im mistaken.<P>You could just as easily dedicate a 1/2 xp server for all these "Casual" Players but you wont.  It will have no affect on the rest of us even us players that are in "Uber" Guilds.<P>Im not bashing the system I only wish that you would be more forthcoming and empathetic rather than tell these poor people what to do with their time.  If the customer wants something enough you should accomidate them, but you arent really in a position to lose much return service with all the new products.<P>It would be a different EQ if it was.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree, Everquest is not for the casual player. But honestly, do you expect Verant to admit it? They'd get a lot of bad press over that, especially from the major gaming sites. They'd be fools to admit it. You can argue with Verant until you're blue in the face, they are never going to admit this game was primarily designed for people with hours on end. And why should they admit it anyway, even if they did, which they won't, it's blantantly obvious for the longtime player and they wouldn't change the game for the casual player. I mean, really, it's like yelling to God for proof he made the sky blue, when you can just look at it anyway and see for yourselves. <P>I personally think EQ is a dead cause, and the casual gamers are going to have to accept that fact and move on to another game, UO and AC are two other options. Why they aren't as impressive technology wise as EQ, they do offer oppurtunities for the casual playstyle. Otherwise you can waste your time arguing with Verant months on end about something they aren't going to change. Another option would be posting on gaming boards and other sites in an attempt to inform the casual gamers out there that might get EQ sometime that this game is not for them. Post your personal EQ experiences and try to get enough attention from Verant that they start catering a bit more to people with less hours to play. I really think that's a longshot. And you might consider a protest by all casual players to not play EQ for a week or so, announce it to all the EQ sites and try to give advance notice, a few weeks or a month so everyone finds out in time and can participate. Honestly, those are better choices than arguing with Verant's "vision" on their own personal message board, that's a fight you won't be able to win.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>     Ok, I have never posted here nor really cared what was posted here before, but I was on Caster's Realm and read this and felt I had to add my two cents. Absor your theory of a casual gamer advancing as much in the same amount of time played as a hardcore gamer has some very serious flaws in it. <P>     Let us take a hypothetical casual gamer that plays say 10 hours a week. We say he plays two 4 hours session and squeezes in a extra 2 hour session somewhere else between life's other activities. Now in our situation here we will assume this gamer does have friends that he games with on a consistant basis. This seems somewhat unlikely to me but we will give you that being that it is well within the realm of possibility. Now the two 4 hour playing periods are times organized with his friends so he will have a readily available group for him. So, lets give it 4 hours minus half a hour per playing session to take into account variances of the players getting on and then actually getting down to the real hunting. What we have left is basicly 7 hours of actual hunting for xps or items. 7 hours of advancement to put it in your terms. <P>     Now we look at the 2 hour period that he squeezed in. Here he does not have a group preorganized. Here I would contend that one hour time is not unreasonable for him to get into a group. Variable of note here is that he would have to stay near his primary group's preplanned hunting spot or waste time traveling back to it before the next 4 hour hunting period. So, we just take one hour for finding a group, travel, and getting back if he did have to travel someplace else. This I think in fact is being extremely generous to your side as just today I sat for two hours just trying to find a group. Minus this one hour we are left with one hour actual hunting. <P>     Now we combine these periods together to get his actual hunting time in his ten hours spent playing that week. We have the two 4 hour sessions minus half a hour each plus the one 2 hour session minus the hour and that comes to 8 hours total time spent hunting. Compare this to the hardcore gamers 10 hours spent hunting. He would more then likely have more friends considering that unless he is a complete social deviant the more time spent on the more contacts he will make but we will still give him the same one hour delay to find a group we gave the casual gamer on his one out of schedule session. 10 hours minus the 1 hour to find a group leaves us with a total of 9 hours spent hunting. Extrapolate this into the long run and that 1 hour becomes numerous hours wasted on the start-up efforts needed in the game, if we could all just jump right on and start playing immediately your theory would be sound but we cannot your game system makes this impossible. Now I realize that various other variables will play into this but in general I feel that these would play more into the favor of the hardcore gamer as he has more time to spend into the game. Such as, party gets wiped at hour 2 in a 4 hour session for the casual gamer they spend 1 hour on CR that leaves only a hour left and most people will not fight their way back into a dungeon with only a hour to go, thus we lose another hour for the casual gamer. On the other hand the Hardcore gamer would only lose this time if he had it happen say at the 7th hour of his gameing time. There are other examples that could be put out but I hope this clearly shows that the casual gamer truely does not get the same value from his time as the hardcore gamer simply because of the start-up costs each time the game is began, thus with longer periods of time played come the greater rewards. <P>     To this I would add I do not consider myself a casual gamer as I spend approximately 20 to 25 hours a week playing, but I know I am still blown away by the amounts of time some people have to give to this game. I am not going to say you have a poor product. I enjoy the game greatly. My one suggestion would be perhaps the creation of a casual gamer server. I know this sounds odd but put a max amount of time they could play on that server at say 15 hours or so per week. After your time had been reached you simply could not log in anymore. There would not be any kicking someone off that is already logged in but just that they could not come back the next time. This would keep the hardcore gamers from jumping to that server to exploit it in anyway. The one great problem I could see is dealing with people going LD if they have pushed over their time during their one session, but I am sure this could be worked out. On that server mobs would be made a little easier and spawn times a little less. Then you could keep the same drop rates but the people could hold a area with the same characters and gain more xps with a higher chance of getting the nice items we do all truely desire. This may seem like a strange idea and I do not know if it is even feasable but I know I would jump to the new server as I should really cut down on the amount of time I play EQ but also do not want to fall so far behind my friends that I could no longer group with them by doing so, because of my falling behind in levels. Yes, I would lose my friends on my old server but I feel certain I would make more on a casual server as well. Ok, that was my two cents though some might now call it more then a dollar.

</FONT><HR>I find Mr. VanCouvering's reply to be even more unsatisfying on even more levels than Mr. Wrinn's.<P>Quotes delineated by '-----'<P>-----<BR>This is really about how you define a casual player.<BR>-----<P>In the trivial sense that one can always attempt to define oneself into victory, perhaps.  But as one of my instructors used to say, that just makes your argument logically unassailable and totally uninteresting.<P>To the original poster, and I believe to the majority of EQ players, a 'casual player' is one who plays in short sessions as opposed to prolonged ones.<P>-----<BR>If you play only a few hours a week you really can't expect to obtain high levels. This is true in any game.<BR>-----<P>It is not.  It is particular in current CRPGs to EverQuest.  UO, AC and D2 all allow much more reasonable advancement to the casual player.<P>-----<BR>A time restricted non-casual gamer will most certainly be frustrated with EverQuest because they can’t get the stuff that they want.<BR>-----<P>A time-restricted player *is* a casual player.  It doesn't really do any good to harp on this point, as it will just cause the necessary semantic change in the original objection to return the argument to this very point.<P>-----<BR>In those few hours each week you make just as much progress as anyone else does in those few hours. If it took you X amount of time to run to a hunting spot, it will take just as long for someone else to run to that spot. If it's camped when you get there, it would be camped for the other guy too. So you both spend another X minutes running elsewhere. Just because one player needs one week real time to do that running due to limited play time and the other might do it in one night does not mean that we are punishing the player with limited play time<BR>-----<P>Mr. VanCouvering's argument pretty much hinges on this point, and it doesn't hold water.<P>Consider three hypothetical EQ players: Tom, Dick and Mary.<P>Mary is a hard-working young professional woman.  Between her career and her active social life she can only find time to play EQ for maybe 2 hours (120 minutes) at a time, once or twice a week.<P>Dick is a typical GenX slacker, living in his parent's basement and working at Starbucks (while pursuing his master's in nuclear basketweaving).  He can easily arrange to play 6 hours (360 minutes) a day several times a week.<P>Tom's still in school, and often cuts class or ignores assignments to squeeze in 4 hour (240 minutes) EQ sessions.  He's looking forward to being Dick in a few years.<P>So let's say it takes 30 minutes to get to a hunting spot and get underway (a conservative estimate; one ship ride throws that number in the trash).  Well, it's the same 30 minutes for everyone, right?<P>Uhm, no.<P>For Tom, that's 30/240 = 12.5% of his gaming time.<P>For Dick, that's 30/360 = 8% of his gaming time (roughly).<P>For Mary, that's 30/120 = 25% of her gaming time.<P>Mary's getting tied up in non-game tedium twice as much as Tom and three times as much as Dick.  Since that overhead is likely incurred for each session, even if Mary plays three times as many sessions as Dick she's still actually PLAYING less than him.  Likewise a corpse run will impact her playing time much more heavily than it will impact either Tom or Dick's.  (This is just like that low-delay-weapon issue that's giving the designers a hard time.)<P>In a similar vein, a 2-hour block is simply not enough time to camp anything that could be considered a rare spawn.  You're never going to see it.<P>-----<BR>As a casual player, I had a guild backing me. I never lacked for assistance when I needed it because we were organized casual players, choosing to play at about the same time every week.<BR>-----<P>Casual players aren't organized.  Casual players don't schedule their real lives around EQ playing times.<P>-----<BR>But being a victim is FUN! I know you won't believe this, but my group gets a kick out of roleplaying all sorts of situations.<BR>-----<P>Mr. VanCouvering is correct; I don't believe him.  I don't believe anyone actually creates RPG characters, a task which requires a fair amount of work, only so they can serve the role of extras in a Godzilla movie.  Death for an RPG character is somewhat more serious than waiting to respawn at your home point.<P>-----<BR>And you are also ignoring the many lower level events that happened on Halloween. Faydedar was not the only creature abroad that night.<BR>-----<P>'Lower level' must be taken to mean the usual L35 required to survive a GM event.<P>-----<BR>In an overall game sense, the lower levels are transitional. That does not make them worthless or ignored.<BR>-----<P>But that is the impression the players get, which leads to increasing dissatisfaction as players find that more and more content is being added for character levels they can't reach because they don't have the ability to commit large amounts of time to the game.<P>-----<BR>I would tell them that they should be glad that this content will be there when they arrive at that level.<BR>-----<P>But they will never get there...that's the point.<P>-----<BR>True, at least in part. You can progress past the mid levels without ever going on a 'raid'. Rare mobs are not the main source for level advancement in EverQuest. But if you want that one item that is super powerful or whatever, yes, you will have to join a 'raid' type group.<BR>-----<P>If you are playing a fighter class, you *need* that 'super powerful' item, because the game has been balanced with the assumption that you will have it.<P>Case in point: my character is a Ranger, L41.  My equipment is Ivy Etched or better in all armor locations, which means I basically have L30 gear.  My next set of armor is found on the Plane of Fear; the one after that is in high-level Kunark dungeons.  If I am to continue playing past the next few levels I *must* improve my armor, and that means major-league camps.  These are the kinds of camps where you have to show up for multi-hour sessions several times just to earn the right to roll should the item drop.  The same applies to my weapons, which must be upgraded if my performance is to meet the requirements for my level, and I will have to get a haste item from somewhere.  The alternative is to stop playing the character, because a fighter class PC without equipment commesurate to his level is useless to his group.  (Just as an aside, yes, I know about Tree Weaves and Sleeves of the Ancients and whatnot; they're no easier to get.)<P>The situation is less grim for caster classes, as most gear is little more than a convenience to them, but they do have to contend with spells that require rare Research components, and since they are competing for group space like everyone else they have to keep up with the Joneses if they want to continue to get group invites.<P>-----<BR>But if you look at total time played (without looking at the real-life time expended to gain that time played) I think that you will see that the casual gamer advances nearly as fast as anyone else (though casual gamers are also less likely to be concentrating on advancement).<BR>-----<P>As shown above this statement is simply incorrect; casual players can't hope to compete with players who can commit to large blocks of time even if they match them overall hour-for-hour.  The game's time sinks prevent it.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I hate to post this under the current topic name, but I followed a link from Casters, and do not wish to start another thread (apparently there is already a lot).<P>In a word, the problem seems to be politics.  Which seems to be the case any time more than a couple people with no other realtionship get together on any venture.  I would like to post some thoughts beyond the politics for a moment.<P>First, EQ is a great game.  By current standards, the graphics, audio, interface, and depth of the game are all top notch.  Still, I think any game company that felt so inclined could produce the same level of product, and there are a lot of areas that should be adressed in EQ if it should hope to maintain its crown in the MMRPG (is this really any type of role-playing game?) arena.<P>And most of these relate to the problem of "casual player/dedicated player".  It is a poor argument to say EQ is only for die hards, and very questionable to quibble of the definition of casual player.  If VI put comments on the box like "To make it through half of the levels on one character type in this game takes a month of online playing time" there wouldnt be 300000 subscribers right now.<P>The fact is that this game is wretched drudgery for a new player casual or not, and even avid gamers willing to play this game 12 hours a day are going to get very frustrated with the constant stagnant pace of the game.  EQ is such that it is hard to just throw away hours and hours of effort however, and many persevere; but only by accepting the pace.  Personally, I would not be playing this game if not for two things; one, I am in a good guild with lots of people I enjoy talking too, and two, after 2 months played time on a character, I cannabalized it to twink another so that I could enjoy an accelerated pace in the game.<P>But at last count, I spend about 16 hours (over a week or in a day) per level doing the same thing over and over.  If I choose to look at different skins on basically the same things, I can waste some more time travelling, but I usually dont.<P>What bothers me most I think, is that for each character there seems to be one or two effective ways to progress in the game.  I find myself frequently grouped with those of higher lvl camping mobs lower lvl than I.  Why?  Mostly because of the risk of dieing and the greivous penalty of death in the game.  This practicality is the foremost reason that there is zero roleplaying in the game, and very little action or adventure for that matter.  Its more like a lesson in risk management and patience.<P>The cause of this, and most of the drudgery issues, is the utter lack of common sense realism in the game.  What makes EQ the worst role-playing game of all time (still a great computer game) is the fact that there are really only 2 types of PC's in the game, and really only 2 types of enemies.<P>There are PC's that can kill mobs if the mobs arnt attacking them, PC's that can withstand an attack from a mob.<P>The two types of monsters are the ones you kill for xp, and the ones you kill for treasure.<P>The idea of classes is completely obliterated in this game by the fact that fighters cant actually kill stuff very well, and magic-users have very poor defenses against mobs, meanwhile, while the majority of the monsters have at least some magic effect, the ones on par with PC wizards can still out melee a fighter.<P>The idea of level is obliterated in this game by the fact that after 30 or so, no one can "match" a monster of equal "lvl".  Even with equipment of relative higher lvl.<P>I can only assume that all of the weakness in AI (mobs can cast through obstacles, melee and move through walls, heal faster, and even merchants are lvl 90 monks that are even meaner with weapons) are basicaly just prudent "fixes" to problems involving players taking advantage of common sense ideas like "If I push this guy of a cliff he will die in the fall" - Now I realize that there a few ways to push a mob anyway, but its hard to be excited about being a lvl 31 warrior when even the fishmonger can beat the tar out of me with no equipment, breath underwater, teleport at me (cause I shamefully took advantage of the fact that If I jump on this one foot ledge the bad guy is gonna try to run all the way down one end and back up the other), and beat me up from out side of a building.<P>Case in point, I did a lot of work to be able to be tolerated in tree elf land.  I learned however that the wood elf banker does not exactly see things the way the civil authorities and merchants of Kelethin do.  No biggy, I can understand that, maybe my ogre has bad credit.  No, what bother me is that, contrary to my foolish assumption, the Banker is actually a karate master that can punch me for 180 damage 4 times in a round, while my feeble 190 str and sword made from shark teeth only scratch his name tag for 11 damage.  Eek, well so I better escape the mad-monk-banker so I jump from treeville for 350 damage and run like heck. (Common sense = banker will jump after me, also getting injured by fall?  Banker will take the time to run all around the tree town (he never has to learn the place either) and I should be long gone).  What happens?  Banker Wikkit and half of Kelethin (a people for whom my ogre just killed a freakin million orcs for (that one hero got his name by killing 90?)) just appear before my eyes and throttle me.  Whats sad is if any though were put into it, a banker would most likely just yell for a guard to deal with any problems, since most realistic wood elf bankers never had time to master 18 forms of martial arts.<P>Back to the sound bite I started this under, politics.  See, large scale games need to be moderated.  VI is the moderator and they have to deal with 300000 customers and 30+ servers.  A tough job, but one they are paid to do.  Inevitably they will develop procedures to deal with the many (definition of politics) and these procedures are what, it seems to me, produces the worst aspects of their own product.<P>The AI has to be tweaked because the programming only allows for fairly inept computer characters when compared to even the poorest players.  That's no excuse, just the nature of the beast.  As a side efect, any leverage based on player skill has been lowered to negligible effects.<P>But there is more to it.  Why is the penalty for death so greivous?  Why must a PC defeat so many enemies to make any progress?  Why is the economy of the game so streched out of shape?<P>Money.  These things, nearly every complaint a player has about the game relate to things that involve time.  Which is money.  The game is played on a money/time scale.  It's actually pretty obvious.  Pretty simple.<P>But that is exactly why I cringe when VI makes noise about balance and fairness, or players make noise about entertainment.  The game would simply be more enjoyable if it moved faster.  The game would be more enjoyable if there was some variation in pace, in tactic, in practice.  The only reason VI doesnt make these changes is because of money.<P>What is the risk of just halving the xp load?  I would have made it to 23 with my first chacter in 2 weeks played time instead of 4?  How does this threaten balance?  It doesnt.  the threat is that I might get to a point where I feel I finished the game.  If every player "finished" the game with every character they wanted to, it would still take years.  I have to imagine board meetings with earning projections where the next item on the agenda is how to make this single idea from on genre pay off for yet another year.<P>I mean, I personally would rather have spent only a couple months playing the Norrathian Enchanter.  Why is it so financially devastating to make another game?  Is there a programmer strike?  (I'm for hire if so)  Like there isnt 10 great and 100 decent variations of fantasy role-playing, not to mention a lot of other major genre's.<P>Ya know whats gonna make a lot of changes in EQ?  A decent competitors product.  I email White Wolf once a day telling them to make a MMRPG.  Or WOTC, or Lucas Arts.  Course, they will want to make money too.<P>Now I am imaginning playing for 2 weeks straight to get my smugler a "dusty parka", the first step of one billion towards aquiring the lore item "millenium falcon".  Can you see it?<P>Hail Master Yoda.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The whole complaint of this thread claims to be about casual gamers and time available to play but it is really about two other things.<P>1.  Some people like easier games.  When they get a single player game they set the difficulty level to easy and get a sense of acomplishment out of conquering the game quickly and easily. They get there fun from this sense of easily obtained power but quickly lose interest and move on to the next game.  There is not challenge.<P>This is a multiplayer game,they can't individually adjust your difficulty level without ruining it for the rest of us.  Your playing with the big boys now and we like a challenge.  If you would liek a multi game with a lessor difficulty setting i would suggest AC or UO.  Both are easier.  And yet you continue to play EQ and try to get them to change it to soemthing youu would in reality probably prefer less.  I suggest you truly do not know yourself very well.<P>2.  Some people like a sense of completion.  Many others like an open ended game where there is no final goal and there wil always be a new challenge to face, a new horizon to cross.  This is the only game I have ever found, so far, that gives that neverending story sense.  Why would you want to take that away?  <P>I personaly will almost certainly never acquire the epic weapon for my class. Yet I like the fact it is out there in the game. That and many other things.  What challenges I do conquer and what rewards I do acquire are what they are, as  separate victories themselves and as parts of the greater story that is the life of my character(s).  They are not intermediary steps to some final completion.<P>If completion is important to you and you know this about yourself, i would suggest you not play EQ.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Gordon said:<P>&gt; EQ supports the casual gamer just fine, as<BR>&gt; the focus of the casual gamer is not<BR>&gt; consumption of content, leveling, and item<BR>&gt; acquisition; It's to "have a good time", by<BR>&gt; adventuring with friends, exploring areas,<BR>&gt; and overall experiencing the game.<P>I'd agree to a point with you Gordon, except on the Exploring Areas.  The casual gamer, those time-starved ones that are referred to, don't explore areas.  We Can't!  We don't have the time to get the levels to explore zones out of mid-teen levels and the risk isn't worth the reward.  You do have to cross the explore areas off your list, it's not practical under the current EQ setup with regard to risk/reward, death xp loss and time to level.<P>And No.  There aren't enough "low-level" events because Verant right now seems to think low level is in the 20s...  How many Halloween events happened for those in level 5-10 range??<P>I understand the population is aging, but please let's not just brush off those who have just started playing or who have started new chars.  As a casual gamer in my first run my highest char after a year RLT was 22...  Let's adjust what you consider low-level and knock it down quite a bit to at least the teens... if not low teens and provide content, quests, challenges &lt;BoBs etc&gt; for the young fledglings in the world of Norrath.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, <BR>I see myself as a casual player.<BR>I have one primary char Musiker Silverdrum, wood elf bard of the 42th song. Born April 99, playtime .... mmmh around 44days I think.<BR>Do that make me an casual player? I think so..<BR>My averages (360 days a year, 30 days a month for easyness): <BR>Time since april 99: 360+(11-4)*30 = 570 Days<BR>Average playtime pr day: 44/570 = 78*10^-3 day<BR>Average hours pr day: 24*78*10^-3 = 1.85;<BR>Average hours pr week: 13 hours.<P>Some weeks I dont play at all some weekends I play for 8+ hours.<BR>I still enjoin EQ alot and have met alot of friends and like to do silly things and roam around.. My bard isent twinked even though my guild do help me alot. I have not had any problems making friends or getting groups. If I cant get a group with Musiker travel to a new area or simply just hangs around and help newbies and other.<BR>I do have 2 low level chars which I play whenever I get bored as Musiker, They dont get much attention, but its still fun to play them occasionally  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Musiker,<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/029312-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/029312-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/029312-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/029312-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=029312&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=029312&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
