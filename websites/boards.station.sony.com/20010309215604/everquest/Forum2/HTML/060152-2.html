</FONT><HR>Good point Gaeb, it not only seems like Velious was designed with CH's in mind, but you can also point out some of Kunark too. It'd be interesting to get a response from Absor as to A. Are you aware of CH being a required heal in some encounters? B. When are you going to retune? and why not retune before unleashing this Nerf?<P>Also, sad to say, Yes Druids got 100x better after this patch. Druids were complaining about their heals being useless in combat and only to be used as downtime heals... VI's solution? Nerf what Does get used in combat then. Now everyone will use their lower heals, cause... Bwhahaha!.. they have too!  Brilliant! Druids are awesome soloers, as much needed in groups now as a cleric, are one of the most versatile classes around, and can evac/teleport!  Squeeky wheel gets the grease I guess...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Gaeb,<P>I assume that was meant for me. I don't think anywhere in this topic I posted an opinion on the current changes to clerics. <P>My original post stated that I have seen so many "Death Of &lt;insert class here&gt; that they have lost their impact and credibilty. Then of course I got sidetracked into my little pet peeve about elitist post 50 players.<P>So I agree that opinions backed by hearsay are different than opinions backed by experience.

</FONT><HR>LOL...Below is my posting to my guild site after reading about the "Hate" and shamy/druid patches.<P>Hummm..<P>Now level 60 shammies and druids get a spell that is better than sup heal. Why even have a cleric? They have changed the "hate" list now so when I heal 2500 hps on a tank with CH, guess who is at the top of the list? No, it's not the druid who just healed for 700.<P>I don't like it. Basically, the only distinguishing characteristic of a cleric is Rez. Whopde-do. Druids get skin-like-crap spells that are just as good as clerics, and they can basically heal as well now too. So why have a cleric? Because the druid wants to blast instead of heal? Maybe they should have given clerics a DD spell at 60 that is equivalent to a druids 55 spells. Nah...that would make us unbalanced.<P>So no...I'm not happy at all with this patch. They didn't reduce the cast time/mana for Sheild of Words which means I will continue not to cast it. For only 6 more AC and no increase in how long it last, why should I burn a bar of mana for it? I doubt I'll be doing much CH as well since the tanks will have no chance of pulling stuff off me.<P>I think Verant screwed us clerics. Anybody got any gear a druid can wear?<P>-Ram<P><BR>So Verant...You asked us clerics about this before you did the patch, and we all asked you not to do it.  Now you are gonna hear us [EXPLETIVE] loud and clear.  This is wrong...wrong...wrong.<P>Change the "hate" factor if nothing else.  Druids get the SLN line which is as good as as our Reso line.  Shammies get the Talismon line which is almost as good as our symbol spells but have NO reagents.  So now, not only am I one of the poorest classes b/c I spend all my [EXPLETIVE] money on [EXPLETIVE] 12pp peridots, I'm not needed in a group either.  Oh yea..I guess b/c we have so much AC we can take a licking from those mobs that double attack for 200 dmg.  How about a freaking defensive skill increase if you are gonna make us take it up the rear?<P>Anyone need a rez?  That will be a 1000p a rez....especially for Dirk Diggler or whatever your soloing druid butt is.<P>One extremely pissed off holy man.<P>-Ram<P>XXOO's Verant<BR><p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]

</FONT><HR>Agreed. And I'm tired and heading to bed, and wasn't aiming to slight you or anyone else, just point out that many people post with no real experience of the difficulties a post-50 cleric faces with the new patch. I myself have not had time to play yet and probably won't for the rest of the week, so I am as clueless as anyone else. But I've seen several posts from 55+ clerics and also several guild boards stating this patch sucks a lot.<P>Urg. Not trying to be longwinded. Wasn't trying to bruise anyone. Just making that point. I think I saw a level 24 posting about how nice clerics were and how this patch didn't effect them at all. I mean, at level 24 I was dealing with Sarnaks in Lake of Ill Omen, and their agro required I constantly be root-parking them to keep them off of me when I finally did jump in and heal. This doesn't work in the 55+ game (resist resist resist resist STICK! SUMMON! SUMMON! DEAD!) however.<P>Anyhow I'm tired and going to bed. And as much as I hate being elitist because it's unbecoming and really doesn't make anyone friends, I wish people without any experience in this area would stop giving their opinions on this topic.<P>- Gaeb, off to bed for the night, sorry to bruise people's feelings.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have to agree with the original poster here.<P>I had a firm stance on not improving the druid class even though I have a 55 druid.  It's an incredibly fun class already, with a range of utility spells that people need and desire.<P>One of the biggest classes that will become affected by these changes is Wizards.  I truely do feel sorry for them because the one almost unique thing they bring to the table, Evacs, is now completely overshadowed by their opposition with the healing improvement.  Not to mention the recent snare/root stacking fix.<P>It boggles my mind that by fixing original game bugs, the game has deteriorated.  Was everquest a complete and utter serendipitous event?<P>Druids rule the outside zones.  They have a plethora of travel and utility spells that make any large complicated task much easier.  <P>SoW, Levitate, Tracking, Forage, DD's, DoT's, Regen, Damage Shields, Strength buffs, Group Gates, Enduring Breath, Invis, See Invis, Mana Regen, Weather Alteration, Group Wolf, Wolf Form, Evacs, anti summoned spells, charm animal, fire debuffs.<P>That above list is just those are the things that a druid has that a cleric does not.<P>I don't play a cleric but I see their plight.  We lost a cleric to a swirlspine tonight from one Cheal.  It was ugly. <P>Herder.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't get it.<P>Is it just me or is the whole problem with healing something that CAME OUT OF NOWHERE?  Maybe I'm not up on 'known bugs and problems' but could anyone point to a post by ANYone in the last 2 years or so that says something like 'oh darn you know hate isn't being calculated correctly for healing spells, we will fix that sometime'.<P>Absor what is the deal?  It has been stated that groups should learn how to 'control hate' more effectively when every melee class in the game is screaming to have taunt 'fixed' for 50+ mobs and to get other taunt abilities?  What do you do?  You reduce the taunt on procs (casters = good change here, melee = not so good) so they are much lower taunt factor, and you DRAMATICALLY change the dynamics of how healers heal?  Let me sum it up in case you're skimming<P>Premise: Taunt not effective enough in high-end game.<P>Absor-PARAPHRASED-solution:  Look into effectiveness of taunt post 50.  Consider warrior/paladin/sk requests for better taunting in class balance<P>ACTUAL 'fix':  Completely redefine taunt for healing (which, from experience is really beating down us clerics) and change taunt dynamic on weapons, making many less taunt-effective.<P><BR>I am a cleric that is actually for giving druids/shamans some cleric healing spells. SOME cleric healing spells.  I think chloroblast is way out of line though.<P>Bottom line here is the direction these changes are going, the gap between druids/shamans and clerics as far as healing AND buffing are concerned is small and getting smaller by the patch.  Funny thing is druids/shamans have a bunch of other stuff to fall back on, clerics don't.  You ever hear a group say "we don't need that shaman/druid, we have a cleric".  I garauntee you that once shaman/druids start realizing their healing ability (PLUS this new taunt-factor that makes our (basically) only unique heal spell unusable) makes them as good as a cleric for all intents and purposes you are going to here the reverse of the above quote.<P>So I'm going to end up sitting at the zone, inundated with requests for rezzes.  Until VI decides to farm that one out a bit more.<P>Clerics going down hill and they are going down hill fast.  Maybe some changes are coming up in future patches to make things better, but go have a look at the list absor posted in our class talk thread.

</FONT><HR>Here's something someone can try.  Take a look back at every patch message in the last two years.  Now look for enhancements made to the cleric class.  You'll find some garbage about res timers, and other things that affect cleric spells;  some bug fixes.  You will also find many aspects of the class 'nerfed' at one point or another.  Clerics have NEVER, EVER gotten an upgrade of any kind.  Let me reiterate.  NEVER gotten any type of upgrade.  They have, however, had their spells changed for the worse many times.  Am I supposed to believe the cleric class has been perfectly balanced since the start so they never needed any help?  They were too strong, so their 44 DD needed to be nerfed 100 points in the first few months of EQ?  <P>Here's a secret, don't let anyone else in on it:  Clerics are made the way they are for a reason.  If it were fun being a cleric, or if they were powerful in any way by themselves, people would want to play them.  If people played clerics, the game would be much easier.  Imagine if there were as many clerics as there are druids.  How often would you die without an xp res?  Beyond that, how often would you die at all?  How hard would it be to kill in Western Wastes if one third of your guild were clerics?  Bingo!  It wouldn't be hard.  The game would be easy.  They are TRYING to kill off the number of clerics in the game in an effort to extend EQ's life.  Too bad they don't realize most people are addicted already and they don't really have to make the game hell at the higher levels to keep people in.  All they really had to do was invent some more 11/19 weapons for us to drool over, and put them in Temple of Veeshan or something.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One point.  Clerics will be desirable in groups simply because we can Resurrect.  With more Clerics dying due to this, I think we can expect backup healers being required (as Verant intended with this).  The problem is that we will still be dying, so the only acceptable backup healer is either a Cleric/Druid-Shaman and Necromancer with sacrifice gems/Druid-Shaman and Paladin with Revive.  Which do you think will be the prefered backup?  One Cleric, or two of the other type?  And do you, as a Cleric, want that Revive on death?  I think not.  Verant didn't just cut down on the number of Clerics, they just made TWO Clerics a necessity for a deep group.  I imagine Verant's response will be to give Druids and Shamans Resurrections next.<P>For those that are upset with these changes and the eventual changes that are likely, remember that there is the low level game to fall back on until something else comes out that hasn't fallen apart the way Everquest has.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Thus,they now kill the healer first.<BR> <BR>We now need to nerf monster firepower. They don't need to quad for 300+ anymore if they're going to mangle the healers any time they're noticed. After all,this means the cleric gets off ONE heal on the tanks before getting whomped themselves,and now must DA/heal self long enough to live through the warriors finishing it.<BR> <BR>You can now also reduce MR,since with the aggro changes,clerics won't be healing as much and can dump some firepower into stuns/DD instead.<BR> <BR>You can now reduce monster HP,since the people beating on them can't take as much with the need to minimize healing spells cast. They also now have a much tighter timer for finishing a mob since once it finishes the healer,it will snack on the rest of the party.<BR> <BR>In short,this HAS to be the player half of the nerfing.

</FONT><HR>The original post is exactly right. This patch nerfed clerics majorly. I play a druid and for me the change is great, I get a whole raft of new heals (on top of all of the other great stuff I get), and after 15 levels of being a 2nd class grouper, I am wanted again. <P>The only negative is that I have almost too much to do in a group. Buffing, healing, snaring, damage shielding, a saving mana for evac (depends on where we are) is too much for 2500mana. <P>Clerics are getting hammered and dying like crazy with this change. Blame it on Verant for not properly designing the game in the beginning. Rebalancing the classes and reworking the AI after two years is insane. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt; So now the cycle goes like this heal/die/heal/die, <BR>&gt; sounds like a whole lotta fun!!<P>Well, see, we siad the problem was, meditating was boring, now we die after each heal and get full mana back, so we hardly have to med any more.<P>So it's an improvement, see?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
