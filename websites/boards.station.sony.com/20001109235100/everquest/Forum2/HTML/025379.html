</FONT><HR>It was suggested that I repost this here since it is unlikely that Verant will read the individual server areas and thus miss a very important issue that involves the entire community of Vallon Zek. <P><BR>For over a year now there has been a large majority of us that have repeatedly told Verant about the problems with Crossteaming on Vallon and the issues it raises (Like immortal healing, buffing, etc) in reguards to PvP. Requests for solutions to this problem were ignored by Abashi on countless occassions. <P>I would propose that we convert the server over to a system similiar to Rallos to solve these problems and I have seen some support from others that I know that would also like to see this system. Faction hits could be disabled on 'same team' kills so that people did not become KOS in every city simply because they were protecting themselves. <P>In this way we would eliminate ALL of the exploits that go along with crossteaming and allow an environment that was fair to everyone in PvP. Since Verant is not willing to implement code that will discourage crossteaming then I would ask that they do the opposite and remove the issues why crossteaming is as hated as it is today. <P>Please show your support of this issue by posting so here and Verant please at least respond to this request, if for no other reason, to explain WHY you will not implement it. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I would rather see them implement the "2 teams (light vs dark) / no crossteam healing or buffing" thing.<P>Doubt that'll ever happen though.<P>Any change towards the end of crossteam healing/buffing would be good.  Either harden the crossteaming lines with new code, or remove them altogether, ala RZ.  Crossteaming should either be fully supported (RZ) or be firmly denied (my first paragraph).  The current system is just a  highly exploitable midway point.<P>We see it every day, too.  I think Verant seriously underestimates the amount of "immortal" crossteam healing and buffing we have to put up with.  I'd say 9 out of 10 times I run into crossteamers, I also run into an immortal healer/buffer, and the number of crossteamers on VZ has been growing at a steady pace for about 6 months now.  What used to be 1% of the population is easily 15% now.  Wait another 6 months, they'll represent a majority.  When faced by a choice of being part of it or being increasingly vicimized by it, many people are choosing to either join the crossteamers or quit playing altogether.<P>We told Verant about these problems back when they did a /movelog and 75% of the VZ population voted to move to TZ!  (thus resulting in the cancelation of the move)  They didn't hear us then, I would be surprised if they hear us now.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I think it's important to note that neither suggestion will remove crossteam guilds.  Removing crossteaming is not anybody's aim here.<P>Removing the ability to exploit the code to allow for immortal heals and buffs is the aim.<P>Under plan A (RZ style), you could team with anyone you like, but you could not be an immortal healer, because you could be attacked by anyone.  ("out of range" healing would still exist, but this is by far less of a problem in my experience)<P>Under plan B (see my message above), you could crossteam, but the code would stop you from casting beneficial spells on your other-team guildmates.  This would obviously add some complication to PvE for crossteam guilds, but it would just mean they'd have to do more planning, it would not actually "wreck" their setup.  It WOULD stop their exploits though, which is the goal here.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I favor the idea of putting code in place to not allow crossteaming also but I firmly believe that Verant will not do this. It would require too much time and effort for them to justify the resources. So that leaves us with a simple solution. THIS is that simple solution. <P>If they are not going to make changes to discourage crossteaming them make changes to eliminate the exploits it causes.

These items can be acquired by doing your own work--questing, killing a mob, etc.  So why is it necessary to be able to lose one item? So you can have the joy of stripping someone of their goods? <P>And don't say risk vs. reward. What risk is a naked caster taking when he's bound just down the way and naked? None. Absolutely none.

The ideal behind the teams server is nice and has great promise but needs to implemented properly to ensure success. <P>I am all for elimiating cross healing between the teams as this is the biggest problem. I have on several occasions been attacked by another team player only to have them backed up by a person of my team. I am unable to stop the other person and all they need do is sit back and heal/buff while I run my tail off trying to stop my attacker. <P>This is the scenario that upsets us the most. Granted it does not help us if the person is outside our range level but if they are at least I can call for help from my team mates and have someone take care of them. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Moonshade just because you (or someone else) says this is dead doesn't magically make the problem disappear. Take a look at the Vallon Zek discussion boards on EQVault and you will quickly get an idea of just how big of a problem this is (literally every other post is something about crossteaming and we have lost several of our members recently because of it). If losing customers is not a concern of Verants then I don't know what is. <P>As the others have mentioned, there is nothing more disheartening than having a foe that can not be beaten, not because you lack the skill, because he is being healed/buffed repeatedly by a member of your own team. While the role of a traitor is a perfectly good one in a normal roleplay environment, on the team servers this is nothing short of a nightmare. Complete Heal alone can turn a normal foe into one that is harder to beat than 3 people just like him. <P>Verants lack of any form of response on this issue is depressing to say the least. If you are reading this and support this idea (or have an alternate idea) PLEASE post to this thread. If you stay silent you only hurt yourself.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Eleric:<P>I fully agree that just because an issue is "settled" does not mean that it is settled for the players.  But that is what is being said on the Rallos Zek threads, so I really was just mocking the dead-horse's rights activists who want people to stop beating horses when they are dead.<P>Seriously, though-- your post impressed me in that you didn't propose an "I'm right, it must be this way," thread, but rather you provided suggestions that could appease both the team players and those who have friends who aren't of their team.<P>Cross-teaming, when used as an exploit to attack others without risk, IS wrong, and that aspect of cross-teaming should be stopped. I, however, feel that there are positive aspects to people cross-teaming (i.e., for groups in dungeons, etc.), and if a player decides to attack a mixed group that includes a member of his own team, and that team-member heals his groupmates, the attacker is at fault for not thinking strategically, not the healer.<P>I think, from what I am reading, that you are opposed to offensive cross-teaming--raids or attacks in which the attackers have no way to lose due to the invulnerable healer with them.  In the case of offensive cross-teaming, I most definitely agree that something should be done.<P>Honestly, I vote for a move to open PvP. It's just more interesting to me.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Make all the PVP Players happy and not use additional servers? Here’s how: <BR> <BR>This solves the issues of long time Rallos players who want to move / change to coin only loot, keeps a server item loot for those that want it, gives 3 distinct PVP options for players to choose from, solves the X-Teaming issues on Tallon Zek and does not need additional server resources. <BR> <BR>1. Open up moves between all three servers. <BR> <BR>2. Modify the ‘Red’ Discord (i.e.: Turning in the Book) flag on the Tallon Zek Teams server thusly: <BR>Players who turn in the book are: <BR> <BR>A) Able to attack / be attacked by anyone in their level range, despite Racial Team. <BR> <BR>B) Be able to Heal / Buff anyone on any team. <BR> <BR>C) Players who do _NOT_ turn in their book can only heal / buff those on their own racial team. <BR> <BR>D) Change or remove faction hits. Either remove faction hits entirely from Tallon Zek PVP or make those players who turned in their book (Red) not cause faction hits if killed, but do take racial faction hits for killing non red characters. <BR> <BR>3. Any characters moving from Rallos Zek to the Tallon Zek server are automatically set ‘Red’ as they were on Rallos with the rulesets above applied to them. <BR> <BR>4.

Please, I am on my wits end...<P>I would take the oppurtunity to move my charachters to a blue server, Rallos or Tallon in an instant just to avoid certain x-teaming guilds who make everyone elses's gameplay experiance just plain old not fun.  PvE and PvP speaking.<P>I can go into the individual issues, but you know them, all we ask for is a solution, is our $10 a month not the same $10 a month someone on Karana or Innoruukk pays?<P>If you prick me do I not bleed?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I came here for team PvP, advertised was (1-item + coin loot)  I didn't want to go to an all out war like there is on Rallos Zek, and was bored with Povar and thinking of quiting EQ.  I came here and EQ became fun again, I always had to watch my back so I wouldn't lose my precious gear.  I also had the opertunity to get nice gear through killing the toughest opponent of all... not EQAI, a human opponent sitting in front of his computer trying to kill me.  Time passed and there were definate problems here, dishonorable PKs that would prey on the wounded then attack to get an easy loot of an item, and of course Blizzy-modem TM people (for those of you that don't know that's named after a char, Blizzy, who would pull the plug on his computer while zoning if losing in a fight.  That would save him from losing an item as he'd never appear on the other side giving his opponent a shot at a final blow).  To get rid of this they took out item loot because of many complaints.<P>I was upset about that at first, but it was nice to see everyone wearing full gear while travelling again.  The big downside became appearent over time though.  Without the risk/reward of item loot the amount of PvP decreased.  Sure there are skirmishes here and there but it's not the same.  With the PvP dying out this server began to become more like a regular blue server and more and more people began to see it like that.  <P>Now many people that had been against X-teaming now X-team themselves.  Ask any of them why.  It's not that they want to abandon their guilds/teams. Its that X-teaming is more and more becomming the easiest if not only way to do high level dungeons in kunark, planes, other high end encounters.  Darks and Lights alike have tried to fight X-teamers over and over but it's a losing battle when your opponent can immortally heal/buff.  It goes against what I came here expecting.<P>I never thought joining VZ would be a good place for grouping with both lights and darks.  I expected a 4-team war.  After a couple months it was obvious that there were just too many more darks than lights.  I whined about it at first that the lighties all X-teamed with each other, but eventually accepted it.  Those that chose to X-team, in general levelled up faster than most pure team players.  The access to all races and classes made many dungeons more readily conquerable.  I knew little about 4-way xteaming until i got into my mid 40s in level.<P>I'd always heard bad things and seen whines and gripes about prophets and xteamers in general on the EQVault Vallon Zek msg board.  I never had any problem with the Xteamers myself though.  As I've made my way through my 40s all the way to 52 where I stand right now, I can't say I've had many pleasurable experiences as a result of Xteaming.<P>There are three main Xteaming guilds as of now on Vallon Zek: Prophets, Regulators, Deadly Intentions.  It is no secret that nearly all outside of their three guilds are against them.  We have often tried to defeat them in battle, but Immortal Mez breaking, buffing, healing makes it very tough.  The times that Lights and Darks have tried to work together against these Xteaming guilds they've been able to succeed.  When doing that though we took many exp deaths from frustrated members of the afore mentioned guilds causing intentional trains.  Also we had become just as bad as the Xteamers we were fighting against.  Lighties were helping darkies, and part of the reason we did succeed is that we were training them causing exp loss as well.  (Of course both sides would deny doing it, or if admitting it they'd say it was because it was done to them first)<P>Many have just become tired of this Xteaming and wish it to be coded out.<BR>I came up with several possible solutions:<P>1. Code us into our original premise of 4teams.  Code out Cross Team healing and buffing.  That would more than likely turn us back into the server you originally intended.<P>2. For the most part this server would do better as darks vs lights.  To do this you would have to Code out Light &lt;-&gt; Dark buffing/healing.  This would most likely produce the most rewarding server in the eyes of the majority.  It would keep the teams balanced and make Xteaming much less appealing.<P>3. Go to Rallos Zek format.  At least that would give those playing pure team format/Light vs Dark <BR>a chance against those that choose to Xteam.  Possibly Xteamers would still win out, but I would enjoy my fights much more if my opponent did not have an immortal cleric sitting by medding/healing immune to anything I could try.<P>Coding out Xteam guilding/grouping could also be a good step.<P>As for keeping those that do choose to Xteam happy, perhaps you could open a /movelog to a blue server.  They would lose the pvp aspect, but they would still be able to keep their friends and stay together as a group on a diffrent server.  Also anyone else unhappy with the Team PvP format would have that option to leave Vallon Zek.<P>If this /movelog took too many players away from the Team-PvP servers you could merge us with Tallon Zek at that point, as I'd assume any change here would be made there as well.<P>In any case, I would like to see something done.  If you at verant see these posts, and read a little on the Vallon Zek msg board the problem is quite clear.  The Vallon Zek community wants something done, we've had too many friends who have sold their accounts on Ebay or just plain left already. <P>~Iriani Triate<BR>~52 DE Enchantress<BR>~Leader of Innoruuk's Legion (VZ)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Agreed, something should be done about this. I know the blue servers are the main part of Verant's business, but if nothing else -- keeping crossteaming off of the pvp servers makes for better Role Play, and I know Verant likes that. So help make roleplaying a part or world on Vallon, and correct these problems, please!<P>I played a chanter to 51 on a blue server, and tired of it. Looking around for other options, I joined a very heavy roleplaying human-only guild on Vallon. <P>It's been a BLAST. Vallon gave EQ a new lease on life for me. <P>However, the cross teaming aspects, and immortal healers does make many game encounters pretty pointless. <P>A barbarian warrior gets attacked by a tier'dal warrior, who has a human cleric healing him. The barbarian can hit the tier'dal, but not the human -- Vallon's game mechanics made this possible. The barbarian can't really do anything -- he's got an invinvible healer fighting against him, no way can he win. <P>The barbarian might then get his guild set up for a raid, on Innothule... But have half his guildmates play tier'dal clerics. The trolls would be defenseless. <P>This tactic is simply abuse of the game's mechanics -- if a player on a blue server found a similar way of killing things, it would be considered an exploit. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

If Verant doesn't do anything about this, I probably wouldn't opt to move to a blue server to experience the leveling alone, because after being on a PvP server, a PvE only environment would seem stale.  (Even if PvP on VZ is a shadow of its former self.)<P>I think one added benefit of going to a Rallos-style format would be the ability of "same-team" players to settle contested spawns through combat.  Tell me that wouldn't make the guides happy!  Might cut down on some of the blatant farming by red players of green mobs only to sell the loot at high prices to lowbies so they can keep up with twinks....if there was a risk that enough ticked off lowbies who actually need the experience could band together to drive them off.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Little bump here.<P>About polling the server, the poll has been done way back (last year i guess). Only result yet is that we went coin only. There were like 20 issues and Verant adressed one. Maybe the rest will be adressed in 20 years ?<P>As far as i'm concerned i'd like to see Verant doing something about crossteaming (hard coding good vs evil for balance would be sweet), or let people move on other servers, either Rallos, either blue, since they can't provide what they promised in first place, that is PvP Team. <P>Or get rid of faction hit to let us make guildwars. You wouldn't believe all the bad bloos your poor handled pvp team has brought on Vallon, please give us a way to either leave it, either to deal with it (hardcoding good vs evil or removing faction hits)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
