&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I just want the EQ community to hear my side of the Ebay story from a perspective of a very early beta tester. I know you from way back then I hope you will take my word for something of value.<P>Ebay is a community of its own , a market system as they would call it, a community of traders that based on supply and demand can cover the fundamentals of economics quite well, WITHOUT the control of say..a governmental figure like Verant that tends to ban ppl for trying to do free trade.<P>Sadly, you have banned oh about...nearly a quarter million transactions on ebay that would have been conducted in the next 6 months. And it sounds about right that more than 1,000,000 transactions in relation to EQ has already been conducted till this day. Let me tell you something, unlike a real life system, the items that are being traded on EBAY actually stay IN YOUR GAME.  You lose NOTHING from it, absolutely NOTHING.  <P>EQ's userbase is only 300,000 users, now at 300 auctions running concurrently on 32 servers, that is roughly 6500 auctions running before you did a crack down on ebay.  That amount of volume generates nearly one to two million dollars every month to the people that do EQ business on ebay!  Yes that IS a way of living for some people, but that is not the point.  the point is, ebay is a way of living for VERANT as well if you people at Verant as so dumbfounded to not understand the basic concepts of how @)%*)@ beneficial EBAY is to your company when you have ultimate control over your economy and what gets put in, taken out! <P>What you are doing by terminating all the EBAY transactions is in itself killing your userbase and losing potentially a million or two million dollars per month on revenue. You are in the process of aiding your game to self destruction by aiding the rapid user base loss that will GUARANTEE a fast destruction in the ingame economy in the next few weeks. HOW you might ask?  It is quite simple, I will try to explain it to you in elementary terms:<P>1) Of 6500-8000 auctions going on each day for the last 2 YEARS, your game economy has already been 100% dependent on EBAY as much as you could deny it, this is a fact.  Ebay's power is many times greater than that of the player driven econmy itself right now.<P>The money sinks you put in the game to aid in the distribution of platinum are due in major part because of the amounts of platinum being saved in banks for EBAYING uses.  The value of certain items and rarity of these items, the way you increased and decreased the drops were based, as well, on the cost effect that was put into the economy in large thanks to the ebay economy having a direct impact on how the game is run.  When you take such a SIGNIFICANT amount of commerce out of the system such as shutting down EBAY, you're ingame economy will be majorly screwed and will require thousands of hours of retuning.  Obvious things that I can think of right now if this keeps going is that you will create at least a 30% inflation thus causing your developers to tune the drop table so that everything is even MORE rare drop than what it was before to keep everyone from having a runebranded girdle or what not.  And this is going to be bad for everyone, especially for the newbies who already don't have enough stuff.<P>EverQuest is too dependent on EBAY as a major economy contribution and at this late stage of an online games life, will kill this game if you decide to continue cracking down on EBAYers<P>2) 6500 items and accounts on ebay every day, where do you think the items end up once a sale has been made there?  It doesn't leave EverQuest, it stays in the game.  Thats right, the thousands of accounts on EBAY on sale every month, once a buyer has been found, will be sold and a new owner will take over, paying the $9.89 a month and thus preventing a loss of a customer.   <P>The reason why your game has been sucessful is people know when they are bored of the game, they simply can sell out make a few dollars.  The character stays in the game, giving the player money, giving you money as well, both sides win.  It's a CYCLE of RECYCLE, people come and go in EQ as do everything else in life, but the accounts STAYS, and you get PAID for the account being active.  What would people do now if they get bored? Delete / deactivate their account?  Let me tell you that SoV is not very well designed, and people are getting very bored...right now many of my friends are selling out, you either have a choice of wanting to take the money of the new owner or face losing thousands and thousands of dollars due to cancelled accounts and no new owners being cycled in.  But I guess an extra million dollars amonth is small change for a company like you so banning ebay won't hurt your pockets now would it?  Well it hurts our pockets.  Some people have invested thousands of hours into the game and expect some sort of compensation in return if they want out of the game.  The "farmers" as people put it, are a small minority of ebay, most ppl just want to get rid of their stuff for some cash and if you don't allow them to do that, you have just lost quite a few users there.  Even Times magazine has prmoted this concept to millions of readers on an edition of their magazine, don't you remember?<P>3) What happens when suddenly volumes of hundreds of thousands of items not being sold on ebay choked in the ingame economy?  Everything will become cheap.  All the newbies will go around wielding nice stuff because suddenly the value of items just has gone tremendously downhill because you jsut shut down 100000+ trades that normally happens every month in a active player base of 300,000 that is 33% man and the stuff on ebay normally aren't fine steel swords, they are stuff of VALUE, RARE STUFF, you know? Nice Donal BPs, Mannarobes, runebranded girdles, laamentations!  Now they will go in mass into the EQ economy as cheapos while being top of the line items in game so everyone can have one!  So what would you do when everyone gets one of the nice items on ebay that istop of the line?  Make more new uber items?  Thats going to take months, i mean Velious is not nearly 50% done and you guys already released it half assed.<P>Sure its great I have no problem with that, but people will start to get bored once they have the top line stuff and not being able to do other things because Velious is so poorly designed to lure them to stay in the game, guess what they will do?  They will quit, Absor, quit like 50% of my guild has quit, and thats sad. and we are the less minority of the server population that has quit.  over 60% of the fennin ro's high level population have already quit, and the newbies and midlevels aren't doing better either.  <P>So in conclusion banning ebay is going to have a profound effect on the player economy, but most importantly, Verant, your ability to make money and keep the players cycled into the game to have that 9.89 subscription a month, will go down the tubes as well, and you will see your user base rapidly dwindle due to a domino affect that you people fail to even rationalize and think about before acting hastily on such a big important decision for the population of EQ players.<P>Thanks for listening to me,<BR>Hafez GM The Mystical Order - Phase 0.5 Beta<BR>(The Original Guild of EverQuest, where the stars are born, including Jalen aka Jeff Butler!)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

You forced others to buy on Ebay because you camped spots for months at a time. <P>Now, if all goes well, you scumbags will scatter off to the next online game you can leech off of. I say good riddence to bad rubbish. The quality people will stay here and play EQ, EQ 2 and star wars when they come out. Any games out there coming out that allow ebaying you can keep em.

</FONT><HR>First of all, I do not use Ebay. However I do not believe it was right to shut it down. Firstly, I dont know why you all have a problem with this? It doesnt hurt you, if someone is farming for Ebay PnP allows you to ask for the spawn to at least be shared. Most will even give it to you. <P>As I said I didnt use Ebay for EQ purposes, but I did enjoy checking out some of the post 50 Necro auctions, showed me what I can become and gave me motivation. <P>Its just a shame jealos people like those who posted here helped shut it down. Our country was built on free enterprise, and I guess thats what I really dont like about the shutdown.<P>If Verant has such a problem with people making money without them, why not just negotiate a 10% fee on all EQ relate auctions or something? If VI played there cards right they could have upheld the idea of free enterprise and seriosly increase there income.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>BTW, all you people that think all the "bad" things will stop. Nope, in fact about 4 hours after Ebay shut down a new site has come up for auctions. A lot of auctions have already moved there.<P>I really dont think anyone could stop auctioning of ingame items. Its just too easy to pop up a new site.

</FONT><HR>maybe so, but I would lay odds that if you researched it thoroughly, you would find a very large chunk of those ebay auctions are done by just a small handfull of poeple.<P>There were also quite a few auctions that were listed for each server, by the same poeple. gaming guides, powerlevel guides, secret to eq manuals, etc.<P>The percentage of players that ebay'd regularly was actually very very small, but due to the nature of EQ with the rare, static spawns and such, that very small minority had a hge impact on the availability of many of the items ingame.<P>Besides, it violates copyright law to sell off someone else'e intillectual property. and the selling of items, or even of the time to get said item in EQ, is selling intilectual propery ov VI.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think we can all live without the $10 per month from a few Uber Ebay Jerks?  What do the rest of you think?<P>Are you gonna miss those people who completed the game since early beta as he puts it and continue to play simply to prevent other people from completing the game ever and getting ALL the loots to play with unless they pay the Uber Ebay Jerks price?  Me neither.<P>Ebay being a way of life for some people is exactly the problem.  I pay $20 per month for two accounts so I can play with my son together and find it a breath of fresh air to think that people might once again have a reason to GIVE nice items away because they can no longer EBAY them for 20, 50 or 125 bucks!!<P>Good RID is what I say.

</FONT><HR>Wow, I can't figure out if you're a troll or just a moron.  I haven't seen a stupider post since the guy taht said when people inspedct you it should open up a duel between them. <P>You said:<BR>"Of 6500-8000 auctions going on each day for the last 2 YEARS, your game economy has already been 100% dependent on EBAY as much as you could deny it, this is a fact."<P>Hey Einstein, how is this a fact?  Okay, go to dictionary.com and look up the definition of "fact."  Finished?  Now think for 15 minutes about that definition.  Now slap yourself in the head.  This is NOT a fact, you don't even know what fact means. It's at best a guess or an estimate on your part.  The year is 2001.  THAT is a fact.  Your random spoutings aren't.  And yes, EBay farming does hurt players, and people like me.  I can't go camp an item I need, or get Jboots, because people know they can make RL money from it, so they cam it and farm it over and over. The FACT that you fail to realize this makes you a moron.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
