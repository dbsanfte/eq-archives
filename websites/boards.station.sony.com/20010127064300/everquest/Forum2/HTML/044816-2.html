</FONT><HR>Curse all of you!  I've been near Faydedar's spawn point only once, and once was quite enough.  Travelling from BB to FV, I somehow managed to fall through the boat, getting stranded in TD.  I'm completely unfamiliar with this zone, so I just swam endlessly searching for land.  Now, I play on Vallon Zek, and TD is controlled completely by darkies, so I as a woodelf couldn't exactly beg for help.  After two hours, I finally got desperate and shouted for help till someone told me about a wonderful place where I could teleport to any city in the game, the firepot room.  He gave me the loc, and I swam dilligently, finally reaching the spires and preparing to dive when...CHOMP.  Faydedar makes short work of lvl 25 warriors.<P>So for all you doubters, Faydedar does exist, and he's spawned at least once too often for my tastes.  Please hunt him down, and tell the beast I sent you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree the epic should be a difficult to obtain, but making druids have to get all these rare corrupt mobs is already a tough quest in itself.  I spent countless hours killing placeholders to get the mobs to spawn, had to get a stone from VS (which ain't easy with all the different guilds hunting him and every newbie wanting the stone even though they haven't started the quest) then all the running back and forth from zone to zone turning in 300 items.  It's definitely not an easy quest, and is one of the harder epic quests out there.  <P>The ranger one is cake, other than Inny and VS.  My friend did it in under 2 weeks with ease.  The cleric, rogue and monk quests are way easy.  We got the monk epic for someone in 3 or 4 days.  The cleric are all spawns that are triggered or on a 2 hour timer, which is pretty damn easy.  Every other 50+ cleric on our server has the epic, which ain't necesarily a bad thing if you want a free res.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  <P>But I honestly think the people making up these quests should have made them a bit similar in difficulty.  I mean, every epic item is VERY similar in stats, yet some take 2 days to get, and some take months (including 300 hours camping Faydedar!!).  Shouldn't similar items be about the same difficulty to obtain?  And cleric get to turn in an item to get the elemental in BW and Ragefire to spawn, so why couldn't druids have had our hardest spawn be triggered?  Some of us have a LOT of time on this quest, and only need one more piece to complete it.  <P>And if Faydedar's spawn time didn't get screwed every time you reset Timorous Deep, maybe it wouldn't be so hard to find him.  I would at least like a CHANCE to finish my epic.  But Faydedar is never up.  He was up 2 weeks or so ago, but have not heard or seen him in weeks other than that.  And I still think Zita is the only person on Quellious with the Scimitar, and she got her pod of water from the Halloween event.  So do you really think the Druid epic is near the diffculty level of some of these other easy epic quests?  <P>I heard Verant is making the cleric and rogue quests harder because they are entering the game a bit too fast.  Well, since not many seem to be getting Faydedar for the druid epic, could you please either fix his spawn so he spawns more often, or make it so he doesn't despawn?  I don't want someone to just give me the pod of water, but I would like a shot at the tiny dragon at some time or another.  And I think having to sit in Timorous Deep for 300 hours is just unacceptable.  We do have lives outside EQ ya know, so please make this spawn a bit more reasonable to get.  I personally can't sit at the firepots for 3 days straight because I had a job, so I am never going to get this item if things stay as is.<P>Aguilera Angelheart<BR>58th Dr00d and officer of Wraith<BR>Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I share the oppinion of most who have posted here about the unnecessary difficulty of the Faydedar spawn.<P>The druid epic in general is designed around good fundementals of the druid class (ie ability to travel, ability to track, ability to forage), which is the way all of these class defining epics should be.  But the way that these fundementals were used in the epic has me a bit confused.<P>First I would like to say that this druid epic quest can be completed relatively fast with an unreal amount of luck, I personally completed the 'cleansed spirit of antonica' portion of the quest within 4 hours, and that includes traveling time, I was just lucky enough that all three corrupted were up when I got there or it only took a bit of time before they did come up.  This is how I started my druid epic (on a *this might be fun* type of note), but after getting the elaborate scim and the corrupted seafury cyclops and camping the corrupted Baracuda for plenty upon plenty of hours (still no corrupted) my attitude and 'fun' factor of the quest has gone downhill.<P>The only parts of the quest that I am looking forward to right now is the slaying of Ulump and the dungeon run to kill the Corrupted Seahorse, just because Ulump is (from what I hear) on a 3 day spawn timer, so he should be up when I need to kill him, and the seahorse is supposedly not a long camp, but getting to him is a challenge which should be fun.  The rest of the quest that I have left to do will be long solo camps.<P>Verant has tried and tried (and suceeded in most cases) to make EQ a group game, where people HAVE to be in a group to do stuff.  To achieve this they have molded the classes to make them dependant on one another, and in the case where one class can solo, they have made the ability to solo scarce and hard (through *nerfing*).  One would conclude that this means that Verant is against solo'ing and pro grouping.  Well, the druid epic seems to be designed to make the druids trying to complete it (50+) to SOLO.  Most of the mobs that have to be killed in this epic quest are soloable by 50+ druids that have any inclination in how to play their class.  This also goes against what Verant has been trying to do for the duration of EQ's life.<P>The foraging aspect of the quest is also badly implimented because for one it is a large unproductive time sink because a druid does NOT spend enough time in a zone they dont hunt in to forage these rare items.  Verant know's that a druid has teleports to almost every corner of Norath and also SOW to make them run faster, so why oh why would a druid stay in misty thicket, Greater Faydark, Everfrost, or Innothule Swamp long enough to forage these items???  The longest I spend in any of these zones is the amount of time it takes me to run (w/SOW) from the druid gate to Rivervale for example, or from the South Ro zoneline to Guk zone.  Very little time when, from my personal experience, you have to spend over an hour in each zone to forage these items, less if you are very lucky and more if you are not lucky.  It comes down to Unproductive and therefore UN-FUN time spent in a game that is supposed to be a GAME (game = FUN, at least normally).<P>So as I agree with using the druid's class defining skills alot in the druid epic quest, I do not agree with the way most of these skills have been used in this quest setup.<P>Now to address the problem with Faydedar...well, I'm not gonna try too hard because most of the people reading this thread would have already read what has to be said.  But I would just like to say that Epic quests WILL be completed, there is no getting around that, and they also will be completed in short amounts of time if the person performing them has the proper resources to do so (i.e. member of a large organized guild, or lots of money and friends).  Verant, there is no getting around the fact that NPC's will be killed and they will be killed fast if enough people want them killed.  So when we come to the epic quests, you have high level mobs that have to be killed and in some cases several of these high level mobs.  So this is acceptable and expected considering the value of the item that is rewarded in these epic quests.  But making these High Level mobs UNAVAILABLE to the people who have to kill them, the people who only have that mob left to kill, to complete their epic quest is not wise in the design of the quest.<P>Putting all the problems with the druid class, too many, too powerful, too soloable, too whatever...<P>To make one classes epic weapon unatainable to the majority because of the rarity of this ONE spawn is like taking some of the fun out of this game.<P>This quest so far has been reasonably fun (to myself) because I for one dont have a hefty schedual and I was able to read while I foraged/camped the corrupted.  So I was entertained by other things while my character was preparing for the FUN things to do.  I see my needed slaying of Faydedar ont he horizon and I feel like giving up on this quest.  If your intention was to make the druid epic one of the hardest to get, you suceeded, but not because the mobs are hard to get to or hard to kill, but because they are just...not there...<P><BR>Bottom line is, in the creation of this druid epic quest, Verant has created situations where players of Everquest have to CAMP certain spawns for unnecessarily high amount of hours, SOLO mobs that give absolutley no productive reward like experience or loot besides the quest peice (these are solo'd because they absolutely dont need a group to take out if the druid is 50+), and spend hours upon hours of UNPRODUCTIVE and UN-FUN time in a *game* foraging a rare item.<P>These situations -&gt; CAMP, SOLO, UNPRODUCTIVE & UN-FUN seem to me to be situations that Verant has been trying to avoid and eliminate in the game of Everquest for the past two and a half years.  Now I dont claim to be an expert, but is this not contradicting or hypocratic?!?!?<P>I hope you get a chance to read this thread Verant<BR>----------<BR>Balise<BR>50th Druid of Drinal<P><BR>P.S.  one the topic of unproductive time spent foraging in zones that a 50+ char has no use in, I can venture to say that some people would help lower level characters in their hunting or give advice and I have done both during my foraging hours, but Verant also is not a fan of Powerleveling (50+ spells being unable to be cast on people of these lower levels) and the advice is good, but also takes away some of the fun of exploring in those lower levels (I could give all the answers to a new druid in misty, but what fun would that be for him?).<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I helped port some guild members out to the fight, and watched over a friend's shoulder the two fights (one failed attempt...you're screwed when two clerics go LD)<P>The one thing that struck me was this: When Fay died, he had the item on him! At this point the druids are saying, yeah, sure he did! Read this thread, he's hard as hell to find and kill!<P>But then compare this to Cazic's Skin for the wizard Epic. A 1/20 drop on a 7 day pop...and you have to lotto vs the rest of the wizards if it DOES drop. Compare that to Fay, who due to his location, and the fact that you dont need 12 hours of fighting to GET to him...<P>It could be worse druids, it could definately be worse.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, one problem I see with posting about Faydedar is that we have four different posts going on about him.  Pretty hard to show just how insane this camp is with us splitting our posts everywhere.  As such I'm going to post this to each of the Faydedar threads.<P>I'm now up to /played 12 days camping this spot :(<BR>(thats almost 300 hours of doing NOTHING but sitting on the spires)<P>And, oh joy, three other druids are sitting with me there now.  I'm hoping because I'm their with my main I'll actually get 'dibs' on him... sigh<P>I'm sure people will say if you aren't having fun, or if its such a waste, why bother doing the epic quest anyhow?  <BR>      The answer is that I started this quest as a 'fun' thing to do as I have done little questing in the past (see other threads on druid quest equipment) and the Paw of Oppola quest that I did do RUINED my beta neutral faction. (thanks Verant, that took /played days to fix)  I had over /played 100 hours into the quest before I even got to the last piece I needed, Faydedar.  At this point I keep telling my self, it'll just be a few more hours and I'll have my epic.... SIGH<P>I agree that the wizard and mage epic quests are just as insane and they too should be fixed.  As for Faydedar, he despawns in 2 hours (or less).  If you aren't their to kite him (and you have experience kiting) you're screwed.  I've personally done a continuous camp on Faydedar for 74 hours, with him NOT showing.<P>Sigh, I have to go, it’s my turn to camp Faydedar again.

</FONT><HR>This mornign on Xegony Faydedar spawned and we went through the usual process of getting a bunch of people together for the kill. When everyone was almost ready (stress the almost) Faydedar was pulled to the Chessboard Island and in a very close fight, he won. Apon reforning, rebuffing and everything we were just about to go again, Faydedar despawned while I was kiting to keep him agro (4 hours after he spawned almost to the minute) <BR>My question is, is there anything that is going to be done about the spawn on this Mob? It's sort of rediculious to put such a terrible time restraint on a mob that is needed for the Druid Epic quest. The zone he spawns in is not a zone that can be teleported into or bound in so getting people there takes a while. so in order to kill him you are actually promoting either Camping or Kiting (both things are sorta not liked). A solution is to make him non agro and have him stay up (if this is the solution, make him not drop the part every time or something), then proper parties could be formed, an organised raid could be established and druids would still be able to aquire thier quest piece.

This is more of a discusion about Faydadar, but your corrections are welcome all the same.<P>And I am sure that rangers on your server are getting their stones when they need them as well, because two are always dropped and Venril is taken down pretty fast after a patch, it provides the server with plenty of stones to go around...The guild on my server that takes VS down regularly has stones for everyone that needs them and so if you ask them when they are heading in to kill VS they will most likely let you tag along to loot the stone after VS is killed.<P>On the topic of Fay despawning without being killed by either players or the Iskar Master...I have not heard about this happening before I read this thread, and I have read alot of threads about Fay.  I might venture to say that after your attempt to kill Fay at the chessboard he might have wandered close enough to the Iskar Master to trigure him, I dont know, but its a thought.<P>----------<BR>Balise</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>BUMP BUMP BUMP<BR>Well, as a level 60 druid in the all byt Faydedar club I really find interest in this.  I had 2 computers and camped him 24/7 for a few weeks with no sigh.  I was lucky enough to hear that he was up and I couldn't believe it so I went to get on the raid. We were all buffed and ready to go when, POOF, he despawned in the middle of the pull after we were all buffed and ready to go. The druid that was kiting had 2 computers and had camped him for SEVERAL HUNDREAD hours.  After he poofed I deleted my level 3 ranger that was sitting on the spires.  This has to be the worst time sink in the game.  How can they have you have to kill a dragon when you can't bind in the zone and have to have a full raid take a boat and then have him despawn.  What skill is there in that?  That is more than luck, that is just insane.  By the way there is 1 DRUID FA on Quellious.  ONE, not 2 not 3 but ONE.  You know how they got it?  Yep you guessed it, it was from the halloween event when they moved Faydedar to the lake...  How wonderful.  A dragon that requires a raid and despawns in 4 hours.  Too bad we have to get a raid from wherever they are and on a boat and then to the chess board.  That is totally unfair.  To make it Fair have him be like Cazic or innie or something, in other words don't make him despawn.  I wouldn't even care if you made it a random drop.  At least then we would be able to kill him to see.  But how epic is it when there are TONS of druids that are 100% done except for one piece and they have ranger bait sitting at the spires 24/7?  How many of all the other epics are out there as compared to this one?  Can't you do run an analysis on every server and get a total number of everyones FA's and see that its not fair.  If you have more than a few hundread of one classes epic than another then I say it's not balanced or fair. Fix Faydedar!  He doesn't need to despawn!  Is it really epic to force someone to kite a dragon for 3 hours while everyone gets in zone and ready?  Ohh wait, you love kiting and are promoting it.  Now I see. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Yes, you heard me correctly.  If any high level druids on 7H are trying to do their epic quest and need Faydedar, I would be willing to idle in the firepot room until he spawns (and then procedes to claw/breathe the living sh*t and 24 levels out of me) and keep aggroing him every 30 seconds (that SHOULD actually keep him from despawning) until you can get a raid together.  In return for this I would expect powerlevelling back up to 29 after its all over and a few screenshots of a fellow druid wielding their epic.<BR>email me at bill_risher@dell.com if you are interested.<P>PS: my computer is dead this week but should be working again soon.<BR>PPS: damn, too bad im sharing this idea, i know at least 3 other people binded in the firepot room (its a pretty exclusive group these days:&gt; ) and they will probably cash in on this too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Verant, please read this thread and FEEL OUR PAIN!<P>Please do something about Fayedar. Look at what we are saying and then act upon it.  No one here is asking you to make the epic easier, but camping a 'spawn' for 200 hours or more is not fun and is in no way 'epic'.<P>I am sure that you never foresaw and therefore never intended these problems to exist with Fay, so please, please, please do something about it.<P>Yours extremely bored and frustrated<P>Taeo Shadows 59 Preserver<BR>Forsaken Realm<BR>Mith Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Another day, no Faydedar spawn. Mid-afternoon, some people were saying that someone was shouting about Faydedar in TD, so I and another druid hauled butt there and started searching. We found nothing. In fact, the few Fay-bait mules were still alive and well. It turned out to be a false alarm.<P>Anyway, one more day, one more disappointment<P>*Please Change Faydedar to a Triggered Spawn like the Cleric and Rogue Quests get. It is only Fair at this point, and not unbalancing because it is already a method you use for other classes.<P>Valeryn Spiritsoaring<BR>54 Wanderer<BR>Nameless - Sanctuary</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044816-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044816.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044816-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=044816&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=044816&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
