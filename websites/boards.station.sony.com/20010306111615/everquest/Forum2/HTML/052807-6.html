</FONT><HR>BUG: (this might have been reported in the 5 pages already  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Sorry if it has)<P>WHen using the song 'Bellow' (first direct damage song).  It does not coneinute to play.  You start the song, it hits the target, it waits a full 'pulse' then stops the song and says 'you must have a target selected for this'.  This happens even if you do not untarget the creature.<P>You have to manualy do bellow for each time youwannt it to work... this increases the number (already huge) of things you have to keep doing as a bard (all while running some times!)<P>Please look into this, thanks!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>repost from thread i made bard talk 2<P><BR>                    Hmmm some more suggestions really on how to balance the class.<P>                    Increase defense to that of a paladin.<BR>                    allow bards to get parry at 40 riposte at 50.<BR>                    cap them at about 150. <P>                    This would allow a bard to actually take part in melee and not feel uterly useless. It fits<BR>                    the defensive hybrid genre<P>                    Make bard meditate go to say 51 or close so we get some decent mana regen after<BR>                    ressing, and so we can mem our songs faster. <P>                    Change desperate dirge to a skill gained at the appropriate level and make it like a SK's<BR>                    harm touch. It is never used because of our mana costing charm song<P>                    Change the charm cap for bards to the level of the bard and make any uber mobs<BR>                    immune from the charm. Give us the message you cannot charm (blank) with this spell<BR>                    like happens now. Mez should be altered to work the same way. I did enjoy charming<BR>                    cazic, but I am not asking for that. I am just asking to be useful on a fungal king raid. <P>                    Bards have a serious lack of damage post 50 problem. One way to address this for the<BR>                    55+ crowd would be to make our level 55 damage song be able to be sung once every 3<BR>                    pulses. Thus we could throw 222 damage into each twist. This would prevent the ice<BR>                    commet every 5 pulses, and since its a stun it will fail on most uber mobs, still great for<BR>                    xping.<P>                    A second solution to the damage problem would be to allow ALL bard songs to stack with<BR>                    ALL haste spells. This change alone would mark bards as a nescessary class on raids. It<BR>                    also wouldn't unbalance the bard solo since 2 songs wouldn't stack just a song and a<BR>                    spell. This allows a for bards in high level encounters other than playing mana song.<P>                    Carpal tunnel problem<BR>                    simply allow a bard to do the following. Research melodies. A bard can take any 2 or 3<BR>                    songs and put them in a songbook container combine them and make a melody. The<BR>                    melody would trigger 2-3 continious songs. songs like chains could not be made into a<BR>                    melody because they are not continuous. This would potentialy give the bard 24 song<BR>                    slots, but i doubt there will be 8 useful mixes, and it really really really would help people<BR>                    who have to change songs every few seconds.<P>                    Instrument weapons<BR>                    Having certain weapons duplicate instruments would vastly improve the melee power of<BR>                    bards post 50. Some weapons already in game such as the breath of harmony seem like<BR>                    good candidates to have an instrument effect added.<P>                    Tracking<P>                    Yes yell at me but bards have too high a skill cap in this area it makes little sense that<BR>                    we are better than druids.<P>                    Sneak/Hide post 50<BR>                    being able to raise these to 30th level rogue<BR>                    at 60 would be nice. I never use these skills cause they are useless as is. Either remove<BR>                    the skills or up them to a level where they work. <P>                    Dotting<BR>                    the chant series needs to gain MASSIVE ammounts of damage for each level after 50.<BR>                    This is another way bards could keep up damage wise with the huge jumps everyone else<BR>                    got. It also allows solo play for bards, but dont increase it to druid/necro/shaman dot<BR>                    levels. <P>                    The Epic<BR>                    I like the idea of having part of our quest be to spawn an uber dragon after vox is dead<BR>                    that a level 60 can fight without getting summoned out. I think it should be called<BR>                    Erdinwyn. Use the vox model etc. Then make trak have the guts at least as often as<BR>                    dragons drop scales. At the point where we need the guts we have already done more in<BR>                    our quest then many other classes. Give us a fair shot at finishing the epic that doesn't<BR>                    mean getting a lucky drop. Another option would be to deal with these 2 drops in a<BR>                    questlike manner that doesn't need an uber raid to complete. One that would be fun and<BR>                    take a long time to do =)<P>                    Tavern Teleport:<BR>                    I think this could be implemented in a fair way that would not infringe on either wizards<BR>                    or druids. Instead of giving easy access to these songs make a very difficult quest at<BR>                    each tavern.<BR>                    As a balance have the tavern teleport cost all of a bards mana or 1000 mana whichever<BR>                    is more and make it work like an evac. You will not see bards going around selling<BR>                    teleports to newbies. Nor will you see a bard commonly teleporting anywhere. <BR>                    I suppose this is more of a wish then a balance issue, but bards seem to be masters of<BR>                    travel in EQ, we run the fastest, this would just be a nice addition to the class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

With more 2hs/2hb weapons we could still get in the fight and twist 2 songs and with the slow delay might even maintain a pretty good hit ratio with the weapon?<P>We are approx. 60% as effective as a paladin or shadowknight when it comes to tanking.  With our songs it gets us back up there pretty close.  With a good 2hs/2hb weapon it might get us back up to 100% effective with our other hybrid fighters.<P>I know past 20 all instrument attacks can do more damage than weapons, i've seen the charts.  But, we do not meditate with an open book, why not let us get in there and get the occasional hit on that vile creature.<P>Effects:  The short range teleport:  Stand outside the entrance to the Lake of Ill Omen windmill and you will not move more than 30 feet  with song playing for an hour???  The teleport is not random distance, it picked the same 4-6 spots and transfered me back and forth.  I've read that it is the lowest y point within the x axis range.  i guess i just have to figure out when that would be usefull?  Could you change the description of the spell if it is not random?<P><BR>Zamphir Panflute Bard of the 22nd song.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>arrr found the right place to post this now<P>How about an upgrade to Melanie's Mellifluous Motion. We should not get any form of port spell. But a line of spells that allow more movement would fit.<BR>This new version (say at level 35) takes us to the safe spot in the zone. The level 50+ takes the party to the safe spot.<P>The other thing I would like to ask is, do 2 bards make a enchnater. If 2 druids/shammys with SH equal a cleric then 2 bards should at least equal a chanter for crowed control etc.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Bard defense already equals paladin defense.  It was raised back when SoT was fixed.<P>Parry/riposte don't help as much as you'd think.  They certainly don't result in any significant change in class balance based on the level they're aquired.  Asking for them is likely to simply get the level aquired changed and a pat on the head, "see we did something for you, you should be happy now," and nothing of substance would change.<P>There's no reason to get them earlier.  What problem does getting them earlier solve?  Will getting them earlier really solve the problem?  Requesting the skill earlier is the standard "I want more and I want it now!" feeling that's based on childish emotions and needs.  There isn't any real class balance reason to change the required levels.<P>Now if it could be shown that bard tanking is a significant factor in bard balance, and that that tanking needs to be better in order for the class to be balanced, then changing the skills would be one way to do it.  I just don't see any evidence that points in this direction.<P>Lets not ask for things just for the sake of asking, hoping we will get them.  Instead lets ask for the things we actually need to play the class the way it was intended.<P>--Thott<BR>Guildleader<BR>&lt;Afterlife&gt;<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here are a few of my biggest complaints:<P>1.  Bard melee is worthless 50 to 60.  It was fine being weak from 1 to 50, but please...there is no reason any melee class 50 plus misses a blue mob in sebilis more than 60% of the time =/<P>2.  Singing Steel Armor effects:  I remember back some time when gordin said he was going to look into changes regarding the summon food and summon water.  While these effects are abilities that we normally couldn't do before, going on a venril sathir raid, getting bard legs to drop, and being able to summon ONE food at a time is a slap in the face.... my opinion, put an effect on boots that summon 20 food/water..but other effect on legs<P>3.  Bard epic:  For most other quests, you included uber triggered spawns to allow classes to attain difficult quest peices.  Ixlibat fer in BW, Ragefire..ext  I think you should consider doing this for scales as well.  Its difficult to go on vox raids...hope that the scale drops, persuade casters you can roll for it, and win a roll out of 25 other rollers.  And there are not many guild that can take the kunark dragons.  I know mine couldn't, do I have to join a guild that CAN to do my epic?  And on another note...the guts dropping from Trakanon.  This peice drops very rarely..why is that?  I think on my server, I have heard of one gut drop in the last 10 trak slayings..  Make one drop everytime/ everyother time?  What do others think about that?<P>Tynulaver Warchant<BR>52 Bard of Quellious<BR>Slash..miss, Slash..miss, Slash...miss  *sigh*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>BTW, through all the flaws, bugs, and complaints that are likely to show up here...I would like to say that I've never had as much fun playing any other class as I have with my bard.  I think it's a great class as it is, just needs a couple tweaks here and there.  Its versatility and unique aspects make it a difficult class to balance and I am glad that you are listening to the community to aid you in getting the bard class to where it needs to be. <BR>/salute VI<P>Sanctus Mirtarr<BR>54 Bard of Qeynos<BR>Lanys T'vyl</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, Bards are supposed to be a support class yet how can we support others when our songs dont stack with other class spells? our songs should augment other spells to make them more powerful...example... the enchanter hastes a melee type, we sing our haste song, the melee gets better and hits faster....the shaman slows a mob, we kick in our largos and the mob slows even more, we bards aren't asking to be an uber solo class, we want to ENHANCE a group to make it better, that is the role of a bard.<P>TESTING, even you must admit this is a sore subject with bards for a looooong time, no one tests bards, if they did all of the unintentional breaks would not happen (remember selo's?) please please please, test your changes on bards before they go live, and i thought it was extreamly unprofessional of verant to make us wait for the next patch to fix stuff you broke.<P>Songs, people have written it all so far so im not going to add anything except this,  song of travel and scale of wolf, can this be changed so if we get attacked these effects do not drop but if we attack have it drop? this will keep the songs as they were intended, to use while traveling and not for kiting.<P>Armor effects...Abashi said this will be looked at yet we never heard back from him, he blew us off....please reevaluate the SS effects...i personally like the water breathing, and the damage shield is nice but the rest???? whoever the genius was that gave us create food and water should be fired. eye of Zomm?? another joke, invigorate and this is the kicker, 100 point heal on a trakanon BP? were your developers on a liquid lunch when they were thinking this up? i like the idea of a self only gate to a random bard song vendor, the pure casters may disagree with me on this but thats my wish list item. and while we are at it, the PoG BP has Song of travel on it? was that another liquid lunch? why would you put an effect on an item that needs to be refreshed every 12 seconds dropping the effect when clicked on??? well theres my ideas absor, if anything read my first paragraph again, make us bards useful in every way, we are a utility class there to support the group.<P>Loramar -CD-<BR>51 Bard<BR>Veeshan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What I'd like to see "tuned"/added for the Bards.<P>Songs in general:<BR>Hastes: Ex. Swift Like the Wind + VCoC (54 haste) Should not stack as 60% haste + 45% haste, instead i think it should be best Haste + 50% of other haste, wherein Swift + VCoC would be 60 + 45/2 for Haste.<BR>Instruments should also have haste bonus's imo.<P>Mezzes: Enchanter Mez should ALWAYS overwrite ours, regardless of Level.<P>Specific song Thoughts<BR>19 Invis: while I think it would be too powerful to make this song work for both Live and Dead things at the same time, I do think a viable option would be to have a Drop/Quested Flute which would make it work vs ONLY undead. ie, a live flute and an undead flute.<P>39 Charm: I too think that we should be able to Charm mobs over 51, its not difficult to set a mob to be uncharmable. That being done, Player level is a good running cap.<P>43 Dirge: Remove the mana cost and give it a 10min recast at 43 and 5min at 55, increase the damage from it, or make it an instrument song so that there is some way of increasing the damage for later levels. While you addressed that you didn't think we suffered any ill effects from using this, but we do, Charm Also uses mana. at 56, 800mana is just over 3.5 bubs of mana. As I understand it, the original purpose for the mana cost was to keep people from Chaincasting this song, which is a good idea, but i think is outdated and a timered effect of 5-10mins would make this song actually used.<P>49 Song of Sheilding: Double the Pre instrument effect, the effect isn't as useful as it could be, and doubling the effect, i dont think, would be unbalancing.<P>50 Melody of Ervaj: Turn it back into a Mana Drain, Low agro non mez breaking, like Mana seive, as a Stackable haste its useless, the haste level is too low, at too high a level, plus using a brass instrument all the time is probably the least effective method of going to all instruments.<P>56 Song of Highsun: this song should clear agro to be more then a train starter. Given the effects on this song, i'm actually kinda surpised it doesn't clear agro. Gate the mob, stun it just enough to interupt its casting, and annul. If this song was not intended to clear agro then what was it intended to do other than start trains?<P>60 Composition of Ervaj: see Melody of Ervaj, add i liked the originally unresistable nature of this song, should be reimplimented.<P>Song additions:<BR>I do think we should get another 50 song like the other hybrids got spells.<P>I liked Ripps Idea for a Song of Silence, a 12s maybe 5min recast, casting block and if i remember the Mob version blocks procs also. wouldn't be overpowering, but would make up for the bards LACK of a true stun, we have mezzes which interupt, but we have 1 stun which in combat is fairly useless except to do 200dmg.<P>Instruments should not only increase effect but duration as well, duration should also, tho more slowly be increased by level, the current duration is a good start point, however at lvl 60 a good bard should be able to twist 5 songs without the use of an instacast effect like that on BoH.<P>Armour<P>Singing Steel<BR>Breastplate: Invigorate is much less effective then our songs.<BR>Legs/Boots: 5 food/drink would be better, but not overly important<BR>Arm's: maybe make it a group version or something totally different all together.<BR>Helm: Eye of Zomm doesn't really have any use as i've seen, IVU would be better, and not overpowering, concidering Warrior Legs have invis.<P>Melodic<BR>Breastplate: change it to Selo's Accelerado either instant cast with bonus's to speed if instrument is equiped. or fixed Selo's with no instrument effect bonus possible and perm effect.<P>Melodic in general could stand to get another effect, maybe Chant of Battle, or.. Guardian rythems, or even 55 Bellow with an increased casting time.<P>Disciplines<BR>Deftdance: I would love to see this have a Double attack feature added, and/or the disc recycle time decreased<P>Skills<BR>Lockpicking: While i'd Like to be able to pick the door locks in HS, i dont really see this happening, even tho i dont think it would be a balance issue to let us pick the Crypt in Seb or HS doors. Getting this skill at an earlier level would make it More effective to the class.<P>Safefall: I'd like to see this skill raised 10-20points as in Kunark and SoV there are many hills, cliffs and sharp drops, it would be more effective while not nearly overpowering.<P>instill doubt: could this even be made useful? dont know kinda redundant anyway imo.<P>Parry: this would be more effective if the level to get it was lowered some.<P>Riposte: see parry<P>Sneak/hide: raising them alittle could be nice, but i use invis when i could otherwise use these skills.<P>Disarm/Sense traps: i've yet to sense a trap to try to disarm it, even tho the skill goes up slowly.<P>--<BR>Absor, you said you were gunna complain about the Lute of Howler, Why? given that bards have illusion masks, and give the other illusion items they can use, what makes this lute, overpowering/ill designed/unbalancing or a reason for us not to have this illusion? if you do decide to change the lute, i would urge you to only ammend the effect and not any other part of this lute.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think Dyfrin made a really good point at the begining of his list. Bards need to be more group friendly, even with other bards. I chose to play a bard because I wanted a class that could find groups easier. Bards are supposed to be all about groups. Yet, as stated many times thus far, at higher levels, they will not get groups if there are Enchanters and Shamen also lfg. And there is almost no reason to have 2 bards in a group at almost any level. <P>Suggestion to fix this, should be to have all post 50 songs more stackable friendly. This will help those of us who spend a good deal of our time on large raids (where you usually have representation from every class to do buffing, thus negating our usefulness) and will make Bards overall more pickup group friendly. <P>What has to be considered, is what can a group add in replacement of a Bard at any given time. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR> A couple of points. One thing which has allways been brought up in bard balance sessions, is that a group get's a large increase in damage from the bard haste songs. Indeed, this was one of the primary reasons that I made a bard. However, in practice, in over 150 days played I've spent about %90 of that time with an enchanter around, for various reasons. Especially on a raid, it is unreasonable to assume that there will be no enchanters present, and with c2, necro pumping etc.. it's extremly easy for them to buff everyone with haste buffs superior to bard buffs. That is where a great deal of us are coming from. On paper, it looks great that a bard has haste songs which improve the damage output of the group. However, since these haste components do not stack with enchanter haste components, and are limited by the haste cap, a bard's contribution to a group is limited to non-haste songs. I would really like to get through to Verant on this issue. I have never really gotten a straight answer to this since I mentioned it in Phase 3 of the beta to Aradune.<BR> Currently, through parsing, a bard does about 1/4 to about 1/3 the damage of a warrior, against a mob, via melee damage. The chant songs rarely land against uber mobs. Most groups, to be properly balanced, only have, at most 4 melee. 5 melee leaves room for just 1 cleric to keep them alive, especially if they will be hasted and drawing aggro. 4 melee is the best situation a bard would get. Replacing 4 melee with a 3 melee and a bard. Your damage output drops from 4 to 3.3. Probably less, since a riposte or two will shred the bard, and force him to withdraw till he gets healed, which other classes can stay in. Still, haste at %30, stacking with everything would them raise the damage output of the group to 4.2. This would be a total increase in group damage output of %5. If the bard doesn't die. This %30 song does not exist at the present time. What happens now is that everyone in the group already has max haste from manaless shissar. Bard haste effects don't stack. Everyone also has maxxed stats from shaman. So bard stat improves make no difference. Bard debuffs don't land on most raid mobs. So, in the end, the bard group is left with 3.3. damage. A loss. Manasong is the only thing a bard has which is not duplicated, overwritten, unnecessary, or not resisted.<BR> My suggestion, if you wanted to make bard haste a factor, would be to come up with a line of bard haste songs, which stack with all enchanter haste, ignore the haste cap.. but do not stack with other bard haste songs. This would allow bards to play a useful role in raids, by assisting their party. Keep in mind though.. that %30 haste results in only a %5 increase in group damage output. Anything less, and adding a bard to a group would still be a loss. I would argue for more.<P> On another note. Bard melee skills, not skill levels, are on par with not paladins and sk's, but with healers. 1h weapon + dw = 2h. 2h weapon + DA = 2 ( 1h weapons + dw ). I can't think of a bard who would object to getting 2h weapon skills and da, over 1h weapon skills and dw. DW basically makes a class limited to 1h weapons = to a class which just has 2h weapon skills. The effect, if all skill levels were equal, would be 2h weapon skills = 1h weapon skills + DW. DA, is the melee skill which makes a difference. As is, a shaman/cleric/druid with comparable offence/2hb skill to a bard would do the same amount of damage.<P> To the suggestion that our damage songs be upgraded as an improvement. Well, again, that would be only useful in some encounters. As is, every class but wizard is complaining that they can't land any spells on a uber monster. These bard songs would just be another spell effect, unused due to resistance.<P> Third, in general balancing concern. I have learned in my 2 years that while getting there is fun, no one really cares about it. The only thing that people care about is effectiveness against the uber boss, because any group that can take down the uber boss will have no problems actually getting to him. Bards rate extremly low in the uber boss fight because so many of their best abilities are already being done better by other classes, and their offensive spells are %100 resisted. This leaves us with resistances and manasong, and it's just so much easier to get item resistances.. especially with their HUGE proliferation in Velious. <P> On the werewolf lute. There is ample in game reason to back this up. Check into the Bard stories in relation to Mistmoore, and you'll find that there is a strong connection between bards and werewolves. Functionally, the lute is very very nice, give haste plus much needed atk to help me actually hit a monster in a fight. Being able to illusion is fun. If you're going to complain about bards getting one illusion, ask the design team who was the original class to have mana regen. It was bards. Clarity was a stolen ability. Ok, now I'm going to get a little flippant ^^. If they want the ww illusion back, that's fine. I'll give that up. All they have to do is give up clarity, which WAS the defining bard ability.<P> A word on that. With C2, the opportunity cost of having a bard around for ms got hihger. The greatly increased mana regen from c2, made the regen a bard gives less useful. Yes, I know. <P> Bard haste/slow is unaffected by instrument. As this is one of the cornerstones of a bard, I fail to see why. Currently, there is no reason to ever use an instrument, unless you're playing.... manasong, in which you'd use a lute. I beat chant damage played with an instrument, with pure melee, which shows you how weak Chant damage is since bard melee is pathetic.<P> Finally, a word on bard description. Jack of All trades, master of none worked pretty well on the road to 50. It's broken considerably on the road to 60. At 60, or on raids, it makes us almost useless. We need to be master of something, so we will have a place. FoH has been destroying this game for 2 years now. They have a total of two bards, who show up occasionaly. Their presence, or lack thereof has never really made an impact.<P>Creediki Starsong<BR>Bard of Veeshan<BR>Chronicler of the Fires of Heaven</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

According to you calculation, a level 60 bard does about 25 dmg/sec, if bards can Double Attack (which caps at 100) that'll probably add another 20% melee, about ~5-10 damage/sec, total of 30-35 dmg/sec.<P>Add in haste stacking and it'll actually justify bringing a bard to any group.<P>I don't care if bards are made offensive hybrid, we can't tank anything blue nowadays anyways.

</FONT><HR>&gt;From what I'm hearing, bards, paladins and shadow knights are all 'defensive' hybrids. I'll add a suggestion to increase the defense caps of all three to the lists.<P>This to me seems a little silly.  I really have no need for higher defence.  I very rarely get attacked, and my damage output is so pathetic compared to the real melee classes that I don't think I could draw aggro even if I wanted to.<BR>If you want to make bards more useful in combat, give them a low-capping double attack.  I'm not asking for a 255 cap so I'll do as much damage as a warrior or ranger, but maybe a lower cap of 75 or 100 that'll just add 20-30% to my damage output.  This could be a skill gained in the mid-high 50's to balance the declining 50+ bard damage output in comparison to other melee classes.<P>My biggest complaint is haste.  In the high level game, bard haste is totally useless.  At any raid, there is ALWAYS an enchanter around, making bard haste completely worthless.<BR>I have no idea what the idea was behind the Erjav line of haste spells. (5% and 10% haste, stackable).  High level parties are already haste capped with the use of enchanter.  Either replace these songs with something useful (the mana drains originally planned for release with velious looked promising), or double the haste values on them and allow parties to exceed the haste cap when they're used.  This would actually make bards highly desirable in high level parties.<P>Bards always used to have the best mana regen ability.  Now, a level 60 bard adds exactly one more point of mana regen per tick than a level 60 enchanter.  When combined with any of the other mana regenerating abilities given to casters with the release of expansion, bards are no longer the best at mana regen.  If I'm going to be forced into a mana battery role, at least increase the mana regen on the 55 Cantata so that I'm good at it.<P>Elwyn<BR>60 Bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Can we bards have a few more magic instruments?  Especially stringed.  Later on in a bards life he has to stop fighting melee and start playing just his instruments, because he will be beat down in a matter of seconds.  Plate does not make up for the fact that we have no defence and no defensive skills.  Therefore, instruments become a bards weapon.  Every other class has 50 or more weapons to choose from, yet bards have only a very few.  Most of these, which would compare to a somewhat decent magic sword for a warrior is a rare fear plane no drop item.  So bards get to use their 5% lute until they are 55 or 60 and lucky enough to get one of these.  That's like a warrior using a Fine Steel Sword all his life.  Not to mention the fact that you don't have to break up the Ball Room with a group of level 50s to get a Fine Steel Sword.  <P>We are especially lacking in stringed.  Possibly add like a 10% and 15% lute and an easier to get 5% lute?  Maybe make the Lute of the Gypsy Princess 10% instead of 5% and add a new 5% lute some place a level 20ish character can get at it.  Then add a 15% some place a level 40 can get to that is easier then fear and make it no drop so it is harder to get than the Gypsy Lute.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I disagree with the idea of making twisting easier. I believe it is important to have people in your group that are competent, and I like to group with people who appreciate the fact that I am competent with what I do. The skill to twist songs, which ones to twist, just in general, to choose what to do, is an important part of being a bard.<BR>A bard is hard to play, it's a challenge. And as such, it should be made obvious to group members. If anyone can just turn on a 'twisting macro', the 'good' bard and the 'bad' bard become equal.<P>From this assumption, In my opinion, a 'good' bard should be rewarded by something that gives him an advantage over bards that just sing one song at a time. <BR>At this point, I should mention that being able to twist is also a matter of connection, but what I have experienced so far, it is rather marginal. Someone with a good connection can keep up 4 songs with little breaks, well, I can keep up 4 with bigger breaks, 3 with none...and I dont know someone with a connection that constantly gives a situation where he cant keep up 3.<P>ANYWAY...here comes my suggestion, I think it's rather unique:<P>I would love to see songs interacting with EACH OTHER, basically making songs more powerful the more you play at once...These effects shouldn't be big, but they would add up, and they would be something of a bonus that reflects the skill of the bard.<P>Examples:<P>Imagine a Naggy raid...you are in a mixed group:<BR>Songs I would play<P>Elemental Rhythms<BR>Guardian Rhythms<BR>Niv's Melody of Preservation<BR>(drums wielded)<P>At this point, I think there should be a bonus, as long as all 3 songs are up, maybe the system can 'read' that the types of songs are all protective. So it adds an amount of extra protection as a bonus.<P>2nd scenario:<P>Standard Dungeon group, fast pulls<BR>I twist:<P>Celerity<BR>Niv's<BR>Cantana<BR>(lute wielded)<P>At this point, the system should read that the songs are of mixed nature, and give some 'mixed' added bonuses, like a small DS, or something else.<P>------------<BR>I thought, this could be formed into a skill, suggested names:<P>Harmony<BR>Resonance<P>This skill would maybe start off at lvl 10, increase slowly up to 100 till lvl50, and then rise faster up to 200 at lvl60.<P>Like my idea?<P>Derxus Silverstar. 48 Bard<BR>Council of Arcana<BR>Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Bards become increasingly less effective when they have to deal with 3-5 resists in a row every 12 seconds, repeatedly.  We have to drop whatever other songs we're twisting and concentrate solely on keeping up one highly resistable song.<BR>Please review resist rates on targeted bard songs across the board.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Original Quote &gt;"- The boots summon 1 water at a time with a 5 second cast time. PLEASE change this to summon 10 or 20 at a time so it's at least useful. As it is, I just buy my water in bulk instead of taking 2 minutes to summon a stack of water that'll all disappear every time I go linkdead. - The greaves summon 1 food at a time. See boots above."&lt;<P>Absor's Reply " Welcome to the world of magicians<BR>Here I find it very easy to argue that not all items are supposed to be super useful. These two can save you a trip to town and allow you to put it off until a more convenient time. It's certainly not the most awesome effect in game, but that's not really a good argument."<P>Kaid's Take:  Uhmmm...How does making the bard pants and boots (we wont even get into the items that do the summoning) summon 5 food and water unbalance EQ?  How does allowing all classes that can summon food and water summon 5 at a time unbalance EQ?  Increasing the amount summoned certainly does not make these items (or spells) have an 'awsome effect'.  It's makes them practicle and useful.  The effect to start with is questionable and the legs come off an ubermob.  Certainly a raid type mob drop should do something more than summon 1 food?<P>Original Quote "Generally what I found is that power for all classes rises proportional to level squared, except for bards. For bards power rises proportional to level."<P>Absor's Answer "And he may have been right. But also, keep in mind that most bard songs remain useful for the life of the bard. This is completely unique to the class, and requires a completely different scheme of increasing power."<P>Kaid's Take:  Im going to have to repsectfully disagree with you here Absor.  The most powerful of the bards songs become less usefull as we level.  Our AE mez song(kellins lucid lullaby) stops working and becomes a a quick trip to the bind point around level 30 and we never get an upgrade.  Pixie Strike (level 28) with its dual resist doesnt start out reliable and becomes worse with level.  Our 27 charm wont work on monsters above 37.  Our 37 charm requires mana that we regen super slow and wont work on mobs above 51? (might be 55).  Those 4 songs are some of the most powerful we have and they decrease in power over the life of the bard, at 55 all 4 songs are completely unusable.  There are more songs like this but these are some of the biggies.<P>Orignal Quote&gt;"Dirge (level 43 song). Mana cost is 800. Bards don't benefit from any form of mana regen, so 800 mana takes 40 minutes to regenerate sitting, 80 minutes to regenerate standing. The song does about 311-340 points AE damage to a maximum of 4 targets. Could you please reappraise the mana cost on this song? We can't meditate so if you factor in sitting mana regen time, this song does best-case (4 targets) 0.6 dam/sec."&lt;<P>Absor's reply "But you also don't suffer any ill effects for being low on mana, with the exception of the use of this song. So I don't see this as a big problem. All it does is determine how many times you can use the Dirge in any given time period. Unlike other casters, it does nothing to prevent you from using all of your other songs."<P>Kaid's Take:  Actually Absor our 39 charm song(Solon's Bewitching Bravura) takes 20 mana a pop and lasts 15 seconds max.  Arguably one of our best songs is rendered useless for a considerable period of time if we sing dirge once.  We are not affected by any mana regen enhancers so Dirge NEVER comes out.  <P>Absor stated "Keep in mind, bards were designed from the ground up to be a party based class."<P>Kaid's Take:  I agree with that statement Absor.  I only have one question then...Why dont 2 of bards greatest group assets stack with others spells/items?  Bard haste by itself is not very good.  Bard slow by itself is not very good.  Allowing these to 2 effects to stack with others (even at a reduced level) does not help the bard directly when he is not grouped.  If bards are designed to be a grouped class from the ground up does it not make sense that all (including haste and slow) bard songs should stack with their spell counter parts?  Many do, but some that should dont.<P>My last small thing deals with bard songs not getting overwritten.  Since a bard can refresh their song effect every 6 seconds or so it only makes sense that all spells should overwrite the bard song.  <P>The bard class is great for the most part.  A few little tweaks here and there and i think you could satisfy the majority of bards.  Seems like almost all of this issues that are being addressed are common between all bards.<P>Thanks for the time<P>Kaiden Antaris<BR>49 Bard <BR>Test Server <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I would like to have a command that, when inventory/melee slots are assigned to hotkeys, will swap the items from one hotkey to another. Instead of having to use the mouse to do it.<BR>Ok, so you asking why would I want this? Because I play a bard. And I would like to cut down on the damage done to my wrist as I try to twist 3 songs while juggling 3 different instruments.<P>Example:<BR>Lets say melee slot 2 is carrying your drum and is set to Hotkey 1. Then you have an inventory slot with a horn that is set to Hotkey 2. And finally you have another inventory slot with a lute that is set to Hotkey 3. <P>Normally a bard would play a percussion song, switch the horn in Hotkey 2 with the drum in Hotkey 1. Then play a brass song, switch the lute from Hotkey 3 to Hotkey 1. Then play a string song, then take the drum from whereever it was left and place it in Hotkey 1. Then plays a percussion song....You get the picture.<P>With a command to swap items from one Hotkey to another a social(which is hotkeyed) could be set up to do the following (I am using "/swap" for an example name of the command I want):<P>Social #1 (start a percussion song then swaps):<BR>/song 1 - this starts a percussion song<BR>/swap 1 2 - this swaps items in hotkeys 1 & 2<P>Social #2 (starts brass song then swaps):<BR>/song 2 - this starts a brass song<BR>/swap 1 3 - this swaps items in hotkeys 1 & 3<P>Social #3 (starts string song then swaps):<BR>/song 3 - this starts a string song<BR>/swap 1 2 - this swaps items in hotkeys 1 & 2<P>This way to twist 3 songs while juggling the appropriate instrument a bard only has to hit the 3 hotkeys associated with each of the above socials. Rather than having to use the mouse to constantly juggle the appropriate instrument.<P>I am not asking for that much. This wouldn't in anyway make a bard better. All this would do is cut down on the sore wrists associated with playing a bard.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I have only played a bard successfully to level 23 at the current time but one thing I noticed from the get go is that we don't do much damage comparitively to the warrior or even the paladin and we definitely don't have the best defensive skills but you can have anything in the game come straight through your group (with the tanks taunting and spellcasters nuking it) and attack the bard because he is singing his healing song.  I think that is wrong and the AI needs to be fixed.<BR>Another thing that I have noticed is that a wood elf bard starts out with a foraging skill of 50 but the skill itself is capped at 100.  This is really lame cause I hit cap 50 skill points from where I started.  Can the cap be moved up to 150 so at least bards can go forage their own coins for the nostrolo's tambourine and the other special zone items?

</FONT><HR>Bard in level 1 46 are great they can fill in the rolls of most classes. You need someone to haste the party or slow, a bard will work. You need someone to mez a bard can do that. You need a tank, a bard can do this (not that great but still can tank). However post 46 the whole scope of the game changes.<P>Eq at higher lvls becouse a big game hunt (which can be alot of fun). Taking 2 or more groups to kill uber mobs. And where does a bard fit in? <P>Every time i go on a raid there is atlest 2 or more enchaters handling mez, haste. This was a big part of my life pre 50. but now im usless in these situations. I mean who wants 30% haste when a enchanter can give them atlest 2x that? And if i mez its only going to wear off in 12 seconds and the enchanter is going to be pissed becouse i messed up his mez. And there is normally a shaman who can slow way better than i can. Once again a big bard of my abilites are usless.<P>How can we change this? Make haste/slow stackable. With the haste max its not going to unbalance the game but it will add a little more damage out put to my group in the raid. A little more damage makes me and my group better.  Also i dont know if this is possible but if enchater mez over wrote ares we could help them in cc.<P>Next are tanking ablilites are sad at best. Are damage out put is behind even the other defensive tanks. I think giving us double attack at a low lvl in the upper 40's low 50's would go along ways to puting are damage output close to the other "defensive tanks".<P>Also im confused of how we are added to the "defensive tank" group? I cannt count the number of time ive have been at full health and agroed a mob or two and was killed before the cleric could even heal me. That doesnt sound too defensive to me.  Granted this is aginst 50+ mobs. But even with mostly kurnak and hate armor i didnt alot longer than a caster would aginst these mobs. Kinda hard to be a "defensive tank" when you get droped in 2 to 4 seconds.<P>I also think are lockpick skill should be increased to a higer lvl. Im not sugessting that we can pick all the locks rogues can. But the only lock i can pick that is usefull is the entrence to the hole. Id like to help my pick some kurnak locks so my guild could go there.

</FONT><HR>On the epic quest, someone said that maybe the Red Scale is too easy.<P>It's not too easy at all, it's that the Vox scale is way too hard.<P>Red Scale requires about 30 level 45-52 players to kill Naggy.  The Red Scale HAS A CHANCE to drop, it does NOT drop every time.  Bards must compete with Warriors for this scale, as they need it for their epic, too.  Naggy spawns ONCE A WEEK.<P>Once you reach 53, a Bard can help a Cleric with Ragefire.  This can only be done when Naggy is dead and the 53+ can not help with killing Naggy.  Ragefire can be done with less 53+ players than it takes to kill Naggy.  Again, the scale does not drop every time and Bards must compete with Warriors for the scale.<P>You also have the option of killing Talendor for the Red Scale.  I think this is a weekly spawn.  It will require a larger force than Ragefire.  The scale does not drop every time and Bards must compete with Warriors for the scale.<P>Explain to me how this step can be considered easy?  If this was the last step, I would tend to agree, but it's not... it's the easiest of the last 3 steps.<P>Trakanon Guts require 50+ level 55 Players to take down.  Guts do NOT drop every time, in fact they're pretty rare.  Thankfully, Bards do not have to compete with any other class for the guts.<P>Depending on your level, the white scale can be the 2nd hardest or the hardets to acquire.  If you're lower than 52, it's 2nd toughest, because Vox is harder to take down than Naggy.  White Scales do not drop every time, and this item makes an extremelly nice Int and Wis Caster Cloak which Bards must compete with for the Scale.<P>If the Bard exceeds 52, the only options are to trade for the scale (how many white dragon scales do you see for trade?) or to kill Goranaire.  Goranaire is the toughest of the Kunark Dragons and realistically requires you to be 58+ to tackle her, due to her AE Fear.  Goranaire was first killed on Xegony last night.  It took 7 tries for the 30 some (maybe more, I'm guessing) level 58-60's to take her down.  Steep learning curve, wouldn't you say?  Tell me this is a viable alternative to Vox.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I pretty much retired the bard in favor of a cleric.<P>software quality on this class has left a LOT to be desired. this is probably my biggest disappointment with the class. the hallmark of the bard in everquest is the missing drum animation.<P>bard songs across the board need a massive boost. at least relative to my 51 cleric, the bard brings nowhere near enough to a party. the effort needed to twist three songs with instruments is far more work than i've ever done with my cleric  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I have to admit my bard solos very effectivly, but a blalanced group has little use for a bard. i've found as far as grouping goes, my bard is great on small teams or unbalanced teams. problem is you don't get very far in seblis with 3 warriors, a druid, a mage and my bard. our role in high level groups is pretty much melee. we have low defensive caps, relatively low base hp. combine this with our low dammage output, and we contribute very little to the balanced group.<P>fix snare. about a year ago, snare song was nerfed (given a random duration instead of 3 full ticks). the song was again nerfed reducing the amount that it slows the target's movment. please choose one of the nerfs and eliminate the ohter. in present form, this is not a viable option for runner suppression in any dungeon.<P>disruptive dirge. used the song twice-i needed the mana for lvl 39 charm. the dammage/mana ratio never was worthwhile, it was never reviewed, never adjusted. c'mon guys this song is over two years old--make it useful for a change.<P>not sure what the fate of the bard is going to be after the last round of tuning--i have to admit i don't hold out a lot of hope. the class needs a complete overhaul, not just a few balance tweaks.<P>Nemesion 50 bard @ prexus (retired)<BR>Physic 51 cleric @ prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hey Absor have fun with all of this  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I just wanted to add/repeat a few things in case I missed them in all the other excellent posts.<P>1) Buffs blink when they are about to expire?  I hear this is true for other classes, but never noticed on my bard.  One minute they're their, next they're gone.  Could ours blink too so we know they are about to expire (note I may just not notice this existing already)<P>2) Items with illusions.  DE, Iksar, Erudite and now Werewolf.  Why are enchanters whining about an instrument that does nothing but change our appearance. No other benefit.  It's a fun game item.  That's it, big deal.  If that is infringing on the enchanter then remove all the illusion items.  Oh, and why you're at it, remove clarity from everyone but bards, that was originally a bard only thing.<P>3) Haste stacking.  Can't say it enough.<P>4) Mid-level instruments... would be nice to have some.<P>5) Singing Steel boots/greaves = forage.<P><BR>I'd also add that since Kunark, bards have gone steadily down hill.  We were left out of Kunark testing.  Our songs fell off the growth curve compared to every other classes spells.  We are underpowered in all aspects of the game except for the fact that we can get across a zone faster than anything else in the game.  Over the past almost 2 years (my only char goes back to March 28, 1999), Verant has demonstrated a total lack of understanding of the bard class.  I keep expecting to wake up someday and find that you admit it and remove us from the game.  Lately things have gotten a wee bit better for bards (finally adjusting our mezzes) but we are well below the line for usefulness in a group situation.  Sad for a 'group' class.<P>-Skyblaze<BR>Bard of the Rathe <P>PS:  You're screening program has probably sent warnings to everyone who talks about our level 12 song Brusco's Boast-ful Bellow... something about that second word and the middle four letters LOL</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think Bards should get a little more melee, like the good ole ash or kick, just to emphasize our semi-warrior skills.  And the slowdown rate when we are injured and using selos is ridiculus, we should be able to get away if we're almost dead.  That's what we use the song for usually.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>After playing a bard since day one in EQ commercial release, I am glad that verant is actually trying to get to know the bard class.<P>I think the first post here summed up a lot for us.<P>Really need to remove the silly time of day restrictions on songs. <P>Effects on bard armor. <P>Melodic BP - Selos Song of travel - Lasts 18 seconds and if you reclick it, it breaks - Utterly useless<P>Singing Steel Armor<BR>BP - Invigorate Useless I can regen myself much faster<P>Vambrace - Invigor - Useless I have songs that replace that<P>Legs and Boots - What were you even thinking - Especailly when Legs are suppose to have decent effect<P>Helm - Eye of Zomm - ?????????? Please<P>Gauntlets - Good Choice - I enjoy my trips to Kedge Keep now<P>Bracer - not bad like the dmg shield <P>Also on armor affects - we should be able to cast them while singing - I dont thing a 9 pt dmg shield is unbalancing if we can cast while singing the reason being we never stop singing but is not a huge issue<P>Resist on a lot of song post 50 seems a bit high.<P>The fact that we are masters of travel and invis to undead song would be nice but is only a minor issue in my book.<P>Now - is our parent class the warrior or the rogue. This really needs to be decided. If it is the warrior give us double attack. Now I think that it should cap at around 101 so that we are total agro bait. If we are a rogue up the dual wield, 1h slash, 1h blunt and piercing.<P>Epic weapon (wish list) - 26 delay is a bit too slow. I would really like it to be 20 to 22 and up the resist values some maybe. it is not like the ranger or the warrior weapon who essentially get 2 weapons. White Dragon Scale as a piece needed. Although I finally got one it is a bad piece to have to get, especially since you have a lvl requirement on Vox and Gorenaire is really too powerful. Either the slow on Gore needs to go or the ability to fear needs to be lowered.<P>Hide and Sneak - I dont think we need to be able to use both like a rogue but you do need to up the skill cap.<P>Add an AE stun song that does not do dmg. Or make lullabye less resisted.<P>I really love the bard class, it is the best character in the game and requires the most skill to play. Just some minor tweaks to make us more in line with what we are suppose to be. Either our songs need get more powerful or our melee/Tank skills needs to be better. <P>Thank you for taking the time to hear us out.<P>Cuthbert Dirgewielder<BR>Bard of the 59th Verse<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is what I posted and a replay to it...<BR>First off, the other members of the group know what a Bard can do. They don't care about that. They know Bards can't tank, melee sux. Thet know Bards can can't take a lot of hits. Bards are a defense class? Whoever thought up that idea needs to wake up. When A Bard reaches 32nd Lvl nad gets in a group, its a life of mana song. As we go up in lvls, we get a little more unuseful.<P>rbroz wrote:<P>&gt;"When in a group, all the messages I see that are to me state: Play the mana song. That should not only be are main purpose in life once we make 32nd lvl. "&lt;<P>I wanted to get this out of the way.<P>The groups that are asking you exclusively to play the mana song, they are your fault, at least in part.<P>You need to educate these groups about all of the other things you can do. There is little doubt in my mind that just playing the mana song is not the best use of a bard's skills. You need to show these groups the value of a bard.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;" I don't pay 10$ a month to park my character for 8 hours every time he levels"&lt;<P>Absor wrote: &gt;&gt;Well, then don't do that anymore. Just play the character. Your skills will advance just fine by playing the game. &lt;&lt;<P>I don't think you quite understand how difficult it is to raise the instrument skills.  My INT is 78.  With that it takes one hour to increase two points in brass.  That is non-stop playing of the instrument.  I am not kidding about this, I have been timing it.  The past two nights I have left my bard in a corner of GFay while I am afk.  So far I raised 20 points in about 10 hours and 40 minutes.  I think using Dexterity to base instrument skill raises would be a great solution to this.<P>Thanks,<BR>Calli<P>============================<P>Original post in full:<P>I HATE MY INSTRUMENT SKILLS! I don't think this is so much a balance issue as it is just annoying, but in order to max out my instrament skills post 35, I have to sit in a corner and sing for 2 + hours PER SKILL. Now, I hate to gripe, and I really don't want to seem rude, but let me be quite clear on this. I don't pay 10$ a month to park my character for 8 hours every time he levels. And I am not even going to begin to explain my frustration with melee skills. Like many bards, I have devoted a good ammount of my equipment to buffing my cha. Now, it has worked well for me, but not nearly so well as buffing str works for other hybrids, or buffing int, or a mix of the 2.<BR>Why then, would I buff cha? Because it is bard like. Bards make their livings (speaking from an rp perspective) from being able to ammuse and entertain. It could also be argued that charisma is more important to a musician than his playing skill (dex).<BR>What I suggest is this, give bards a GOOD reason to buff cha, which by the way, is a hard stat to get up there. <BR>1. Change our instrament skills to Cha based skill gain.<P>2. Base our mana off of cha.<P>3. Make cha have a greater effect on our mind affecting songs.<P>4. and finally make Cha have a higher influence on our fizzle rates.<P>This would at least give us more incentive to develope a stat that, as it stands, is really only good for mez and charm. While this may be good for enchanters who get a ton of these types of spells, these only represent a small portion of the bard arsenal.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I hope Absor has the patience to go through the valid posts.  I've grown accustomed to being inferior as far as buffing and damage output.  I love playing a complex class as more than once I've been able to get my party out of a bind when we're in trouble.<BR>There is also a big gap in effectiveness between a bard who just plays 1 song and a bard who can manage to sing 4.  It used to also mean (after months of high endurance training my wrists are unaffected  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> a sore wrist after playing for 6 hours straight.<BR>One big question I have is why are our songs limited in power?  An enchanter and shaman can buff each party and do a significant amount of damage or crowd control, whilst a bard must spend his energies just keeping up 4 buffs (assuming the server is in a happy mood) which are inferior.<BR>I don't have much hope in getting our class adjusted to be balanced, but no matter what, I'll always enjoy playing my bard due to its complexities.<P>You've opened up a can of worms, Absor.  I wish you luck in deciding what needs to be done for bards.<P>-Toggy</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
