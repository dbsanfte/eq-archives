</FONT><HR>I was thinking about our DS's that we are given.  I was wondering if you could take them away from us because it actually hurts us more than it helps us.<P>Think about it.<P>If we get Damage Shields then mobs do.  Mobs always had our low level one and it did 2dmg?  Fine...that won't hurt a tank that much and dispell wasn't really needed.  Now you have a 5pt damage shield with our new spell.  That is a TON of damage from a damage shield and that also means one of the casters/healers has to blow mana for a dispell...means a shaman can't slow right away...means it does nothing but add downtime unless you are fighting in an area without wizard type mobs which there are a LOT of areas with wizard type mobs.<P>Just take this entire spell line away from us and give us something usefull.  These spells hurt us more than help.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm beginning to think that the post 50 wizards out there may have had it easier than we do now when they were low levels. Remember, back then the game was newer and high-end armor and weaponry may not have proliferated into the hands of so many players. Melee classes were not as powerful as they are now. This along with the subsequent class changes and game releases result in the wizard class devolving into a third rate damage producer. <P>Before anyone implies that newer players are just whiners that don't understand how to play the class, try starting a new wizard...go out there and experience the "fun" all over again. <BR>*** You have been slain by an Orc Pawn.***<BR>*** LOADING...Please wait.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>If nothing else is changed to the wizard class, I would be happy with at least a 2x mana regen rate.<P>The downtime is what makes EQ a borring game to play.<P>What other game can you think of where its considered fun to sit on your butt doing nothing for 12 to 13 minutes between kills? Sorry EQ is not one of them, but wizards are considered balanced even though this is fact for them.<P>Wizards where actually more fun to play at lower levels pre-level 18 then they are a post 50, why is because exp really stinks solo post 50 and its not fun sitting around doing nothing for hours on end waiting to get into a group.<P>It wouldnt take that long to make the changes necessary to make the class more fun and balanced to play.<P>57 Wizard of the Nameless<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Thanks for the excellent post Grimstaff. I hope it gets noticed.<P>I made a suggestion earlier that I didn't see anyone comment on, so I'll shamelessly mention it again.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> What about being able to cast through something like the Eye of Zomm? I think it would be nice if it was a mirror image kind of spell, in that it looked like the caster, but it could look just like the eye and be just as effective.<P>Basically, this would allow the wizard to go places that he or she would not ordinarily go -- such as into melee combat range. It would also give the wizard the effect of a few more hit points since the monster would aggro on the duplicate (and kill it) before moving on to the wizard. It wouldn't be like a pet since the wizard would be sitting in an out of the way spot (vulnerable to attack) and wouldn't act independently.<P>Since the wizard is sitting down, why not let him or her meditate at the same time? This would give wiards a benefit over other casters in that they can be casting and meditating simultaneously, but since it takes 12 or more minutes to med at higher levels, it wouldn't really be that dramatic. (In other words, if you can dump all your mana in 30 seconds, you're really only gaining 30 seconds of med time in that 12 minutes.)<P>I think this would address a couple of wizard concerns: increase mana regen (although not alot) and therefore decrease down time, and it would be group friendly (in a group of casters you can keep watch while the others med). I admit it wouldn't make wizards the most powerful caster hands down, but these advantages combined with some small improvements in DD might be enough to more clearly push wizards to the front when it comes to DD. Add in a few other group friendly abilities and I think we'd be moving alot closer to "balance". <P>I suppose this would help wizard soloing ability slightly since the wiz would be able to stand more punishment, but I don't think it would be that unbalancing. In groups however, the wizard could do a bit more offensive casting and have a chance to survive aggro as the tanks try to taunt the monster off the duplicate.<P>Besides, this just seems very "wizardly" to me. :P Take it for what it's worth.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Oh, one other thing I didn't clearly mention. There is a pretty serious downside to using this spell. The wizard is left sitting and vulnerable to attack. This means that you won't use the spell for safe and secure kiting since if you get too far away, you can be killed before you could get back.<P>As I see it, one of two things could happen if the wizard is attacked. <P>1) The spell breaks, resulting in the disappearance of the duplicate. If you were fighting some other mobs, they are now running in your in your direction as fast as possible *and* you have to deal with whatever attacked you.<P>2) The spell does not break, but you are taking "real" damage. You must decide to either cancel the spell yourself (resulting in situation 1) or try to finish off whatever you are doing and run back before you are killed.<P>Come to think of it, this is very much like Astral projection. It doesn't seem like it would be too hard to implement (eye of Zomm already does the hard part I think) and would make the wizard much more unique. Before the changes that have taken place on test, I would have said there was no way we'd see this kind of change, but I'm more hopeful now.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Great post again Grimstaff, for the low level Wiz (pre 44) as well for the high level Wiz (post 50). Indeed our damage output become patheteic... more and more as higher we go in levels.<P>And another thing is bothring me really:<P>Druid DD spell (purchasable at the Vendors) Level 59: 1024 damage<P>Wizard at 59: 728 damage<P><BR>Ohhh, ok, maybe we cast it a litle faster and the mana damage ratio is 5 points of mana in benefit for us... but see mz point here: We are NOT Masters of damage even ore, not even Matsres of magical damage...<P>Suntrike doeas 1615 damge for 450 mana and is just an upgraded Ice Comet... IF you get that spell that is. If you are unlucky, ost Wiz are, then you have no damage upgrade at level 60, while Druids can buy their Ice COmet spell just. As well i think we should have a Magic DD (PURCHASABLE) at level 60... we only have fire and Ice and should get Magic as well. PLease consider, that we are at level 60 real Sorecers and should be able to provide damage with all elementals...<P><BR>Natan Magus<P>60 Sorcerer<BR>Mith Marr<P><BR>P.S.: A higher damage output for ALL our spell is nessecary. AS well are higher mana regeneration and less mana usage on our DDs... at ALL levels, but this becomes visable even more in the high end game. We have no haste spells, no str spells and no other buffs like the melees that increase our damage output... ohh yes we have that wonderfull Harvest spell and Clarity II... this don't even scratch it.<P>I still can't believe that Absor semms not to see, tha the Wiz class is terrible broken. I could imagine they think instead of that about some new nerf... or increase the damage output of meleers even more. Now, that the Velkious MOBs have that much Hitpoints, the damage output of Meleers has to become increased as well. I only see no will of VI to improve our class and FIX it. I guess they wil throw us a bone, a Pointy Hat. Oh great... this will really help me in a group... cool idea , really  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, everyone STOP WITH THE NIT PICKY IDEAS.  Forget about changing the evac locations, forget about the pointy hats.  We have one main problem, and one main problem only.  Doing something all the time in a grp.  <P>We do 2 things:  We group gate, and we nuke.  Thats it.  We nuke better than a mage/necro/druid/cleric in a short period, but when we are both out of mana, by the time we are both fm, the pet has WAY outdone us, and the mage/necro prevails with about a 160% more efficiency (maybe more).  I would agree that we can pretty much out nuke a cleric/druid, but I think they pretty much outdo us in healing, sowing, porting, resing, buffing, thorning, well, you get the picture.  People say, "Well, the reasone necros and mages can out damage in the long run is because they don't get GG spells".  My answer to that:  Necro can damage, plus help party out by transfering mana.  In my oppinion, thats powerful enough to be an even trade right there.  But it's not, the necro gets to outdamage as well, not really fair.  On top of that, the necro gets to summon corpse, dot, yada.  Same for mage, he gets CoH.  He is the man in raids, and dungeons like seb where you can't just simply switch out party members.  The mage can also damage shield the tank, and do other party friendly tricks.  Again, an even trade in my oppinion for not having GG's.  And if you don't agree with me, then hell give them some personal gate spells to make them happy.  <P>My main complaint is that EQ hinges off certain classes.  Warriors, Clerics, Enchanters.  It's sad when a grp gets a chanter and is like, "Ahh Yeah!, chanter in the house baby!  C2/Mez in the hoooouuuuuse!".  I bet that makes them feel really good.  Here is a challenge for you Verant: Make every class feel that way when they get in a grp.  When you do that, the classes are balanced.  Until then, keep trying.<P>Here is my proposed fix for Wizzies:  Make rains less resistable!  This is the most balanced spell in the game.  You can't solo with it because they have to stay in place.  The only other thing I can think of is an upgrade to Harvest at say lvl 56 or 57.  I mean, there has to be something to look forward to.  Every class has that major spell to look forward to.  For us it was IC, now we need something new.  Clerics have a new res, necros have better mana to hp, and pets, mages have CoH, Rogues have some serious BS, and the 32k proc, other classes finally get reses (pallys), sk's get summon corpse.  You get the picture, give us something to look forward to, and that would be to be more mana efficient, THATS IT.  Forget about all the other lame stuff.<P>Nestling<BR>53.1 wiz Mith Marr (would be 60, but dabating whether it's worth it or not)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I just want more damage!<P>Screw the ports and the mana regen, if I can do a LOT, and I mean a LOT of damage in one shot I'd be happy.<P>I want the tanks to see a drop in the Mob's HP bar (PLEASE make a faster updating bar, make it instantanous in the case of nukes!) and think, well that was the Wizard nuking.<P>I DONT want him to think, well either that was the Mage, Druid, or any other class with a comparable nuke casting. And if it's a real big drop in HP he'd think "Well that was the Rogue Backstabbing".<P>C'mon Verant, I want to do what we were supposed to! BIG damage!<P>I'm talking take extisting mana costs for all spells and....  leave them the same!<P>Then take all damage for existing spells and.... quadruple it!<P>I want to PULL MY WIEGHT. If I can only drop 1 or 2 nukes onto a mob to conserve mana, I want that 1 or 2 nukes to be a fair share of the damage. 1/6 at the LEAST. 1/3 sounds more fair.<P>A nice 4k Ice Comet would be really nice. Considering you'd only have 5 casts of it anyway.<P>Of course I am just ranting. 4x damage is extreme.<P>But please, increase by a noticable percent.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Humm, how about a spell that forces the target's weapon to proc? Would have a delay of 20-30 seconds for recast so you couldn't just chain cast. It'd be an added benefit for our grouping ability and not unbalancing (unless there's some super proccing weapon I can't think about). Mana cost would have to be low though, else why waste the mana when someone else can just cast the spell.

</FONT><HR>Not my ideas, 2 relatively new ideas i have seen and liked.<P>1.  Make a new harvest spell that gives all party members more mana (group harvest, like group DS or group heal or group clarity).  It wouldn't increase soloing power, and make us popular in groups.  Scale up the mana regen post 50 as well.  I want the other members to notice their blue bars pulsing up when i harvest.<P>2.  Be able to cast PB AEs through the tank, or other character.  Let the tank or whoever the spell is cast through take the agro.  <P>Maybe even combine this with the "magic sword" idea and have the AE go off when the character it is cast on swings... this would actually be a new spell though if done this way.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>DD) I would like to see *harder* hits post 50; what ever happened to damage?(Also, at 60, you have to drop down levels for different types of Lures-who's damage are low for that level, how about scaling the damage better per level?)<P>AE) This can be *very* tricky, and most groups NEVER want to use it.  It is a lot safer to just assist the tank on one target, or have an enchanter mez.  What about lower aggro on AE spells?  Most 50+ AE are *very* good in damage/efficiancy, but a lot of pre-50 AE's are weak<P>Items) Wizards have close to ZERO wizard-only items before the planes.  We have to share a lot with the other pure casters, but they also get some class-only items.  How about giving wizards lots of items with effects/spells on them?  I can see a wizard having lots of magical items to use-and they dont have to be Damage items, spells like Shieldings, Skins, O'kiels, Visions, snare, root, levitation, invis, Yonder, etc.<P>Resists) Sort of connected to items.  Wizards are the masters of magic and the elements right?  So why dont we have some innate resistances to spells?  We sort of get this with Elemental Armor, but I would like to see more.  I see Warriors as masters of fighting so they are able to withstand a lot of hits, why not make Wizards able to withstad magical attacks-as it is we can be killed by both melee and magic<P>Everything else has be covered by other posters.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I want to add my comments to Grim's excellent email..Sineed, Do you dream of really playing a lvl 52 wizzy or are you confused and its really lvl 52 over powered druid ?<P>For Absor and the others I have been playing a few months and am finally lvl 24 wizzy. Here are my comments.....<P>BALANCE ISSUES<BR>These are things that relate directly to the balance of the Wizard class in the game.<P>Too weak and easily killed at lower levels <BR>(Too weak to solo since about lvl 15)<P>-Unable to contribute in highest level Velious fights (due to hit point totals)<BR>Don't know, not there yet.<P>-Damage Inequities (levels 1-15 and 34-38 outgunned by other classes)<BR>This is a big one for me, necro just got his DD spell and he is doing 146, My best is 130-169 if they don't resist. Uggggg!!!!! So much for being the best at DD!!!!<P>-Resistance cap at 6+ or 1.2x level reduced Wizard to meditating when party needs him most<BR>I am medding more than any other charachter in the game even with breeze/clarity. Most of them have Pets, mana conversion, etc to offset their medding times.<P>-Harvest post 50 appears to not work properly<BR>Don't know.<P>-Needing to dip as many as 15 levels for a given damage type of Fire, Cold, Magic<BR>-Damage poorly scaled compared to monster’s hit points (damage output and value to group by level lowers each level)<BR>-Mana efficiency and damage too poor for group contribution when compared to melee and pet classes at lower levels<BR>At Level 24 this still holds true for me.!!!<P>-Fizzles at highest levels too common<BR>-Tishan’s Relocation is a deathtrap, that is unacceptable for an evac spell.<P>REPAIR ISSUES<BR>These are things that are only slightly related to balance but contribute to imbalance because they are not working properly.<P>-Al’Kabor line costs too much mana and does too little damage to be of any use.<BR>-Concussion Spell quest requires you to be significantly higher level than the spell<BR>-Imbue Fire Opal is in Nagafen’s Lair, nothing you can achieve at the level of the spell<BR>-Area Effect Rain spells STILL have problems (not enough waves of effect, highly resistable)<BR>-Bind Sight spell sticks and stops moving<BR>-Fade, Shadowstep, Yonder will not teleport you UP and will not port beyond objects<BR>-Bonds of Force has Z-axis problems<BR>-Enstill costs more mana and casts slower but almost never has any more effect than normal root.<BR>-Staff of Temperate Flux worthless in its intended use (needs more than 6 points of resistance reduction on cold/fire)<BR>-Post 35 innate resistance reduction does not appear to be in the game, if so it is very insignificant<BR>-Area Effect spells are sporatically efficient, often are not, and in no pattern (making them consistently useful would encourage their use and learning)<BR>-Cazic Thule gate in a poor place, move outside<BR>-Color/Graphic issues (red ice, etc)<BR>-Level 44 interrupt blast is too slow to hope to interrupt spells unless you really get lucky<BR>-O’Kiels Flickering Flame costs too much mana.<BR>Agreed!, AT level 24 all of these hold true for me as well.<P>ENHANCEMENT ISSUES<BR>These are areas that, like giving Resist Cold to Rangers or better heals to Druids would make Wizards a class that people want to group with more and more useful.<P>-Push Ports (teleports with y/n dialog box that send the target to the location but not the Wizard)<BR>-Bigger blasts past level 50, so people won’t have to use AE Rains on single targets to be able to do damage<BR>-Lower level Draught-type spells (without the mana efficiency) for that quick blast in an emergency<BR>-Lower level Lure-type spells (Verant keeps adding EXTREMELY resistant creatures to the game even at levels lower than 44).<P>I'll add<BR>Get rid of the Sight spells since they aren't needed for quests and they royally suck. In their place, give us some grouping abilities. A quick fix would be to give us some spells like breeze, clarity, mez, Necro's pet(NOT Enchanters, they suck), Necro's mana conversion, etc. <P>CONCEPTUAL DIFFICULTIES<BR>These are issues with the concept and design of the Wizard class, where the idea behind the class or areas in it are troubled.<P>-UV spell is at highest level of all classes and self only (sight spells SPECIFICALLY mentioned in description of class and concept, why is this so?)<BR>-Sight line (glimpse etc) have no actual effect, would be nice if these could be fixed<BR>-Quick damage is supposed to compensate for downtime and no contribution without mana, does it? Is Wizard damage really faster and better in the short term, and is this a valid design concept, given the nature of groups now and aggro?<BR>-Start out weak and grow to be the same power level as everyone else, valid concept?<BR>-Planar Gates, we get 2 of the 5, one requires an expensive gem and one we don’t have much reason to go to. Why keep adding more that Wizards don’t port to?<BR>-Why was the description of Wizards written the way it was, and what changed between its writing and now that required it to be altered and for it to not be true?<BR>-Wizards have notable weaknesses<BR>--no contribution without mana<BR>--unable to assist group if over resist cap<BR>--any other class can clear a dungeon of low greens without stopping<BR>--related to above, helpless without mana (low greens easily kill)<BR>Is the rest of the class design adequate compensation for these weaknesses?<BR>-Gravity Flux at higher level than Enchanters, who get NO other AE spells.<BR>Agreed also,<BR>Since lvl 15 or so, I can't kill anything without help, roots don't last long enough and enstill costs too much mana and doesn't last long enough to med enough back to kill the MOB before it is pounding on me again and interrupting my spells which rarely recover. IE, LOADING, PLEASE WAIT!!!<P>WISH LIST<BR>Just goodies we can dream about, nothing critical but hey, why not bring it up while you are paying attention?<P>-Sense monster line (gives basic information about monsters like if they have high resistances, their social tendencies (groups up, runs, etc), what kind they are (undead, summoned etc).<BR>-Make Staff of the Wheel look distinct (Wizards have nothing like a pet etc to look unique)<BR>-Eye of Zomm that can swim (present one has swimming of 1)<BR>-Spell that lets Wizards see through any atmospheric effect as if it wasn’t there<BR>-Spell that lets Wizards see underwater clearly (crocodile eye effect always).<BR>-Pointy hat! (with a brim or the top bent over)<BR>-Familiar (non combatant pet mostly for show)<BR>-WK portal moved<BR>-Ocean of Tears portal<BR>-Low level skin spells (using low level reagent)<BR>-spell that only interrupts casting, quick cast time<BR>-spell that lets Wizards read any language<BR>-spell that lets Wizards comprehend and speak any language<BR>-tracking spell (have to recast each target, limited time period)<BR>-bigger, powerful blasts with poor mana efficiency, low casting time and long recast time<BR>-Guild Gate (Clerics got the idea from this-makes more sense for Wizards) ports you to your racial home guild<BR>-Shadowstep type spell that ports you in random distance within 90 degrees of facing<BR>-Magic Resist self buff<BR>-Poison/Disease self buff upgrade.<BR>-More Wizard quests (class with the fewest class-specific quests in the game, seekers of what?)<BR>-More Wizard only items (see above).<P>There are many possibilities here, I have become so frustrated as I read the posts from all of you fellow merlins, that I realizedjust how broken we really are. I have almost quit playing many times in the days since this discussion began. <P>Those of you UBER Wizards should reroll your wizzy and do it all over again, things have changed in the low game! <P>I am faithful that future patches will include updates that will truly bring back our status of "Wizards are the class who has no rivals" that VI mentions in our class description and the reason I choose to play a Wizard in the first place! <P>Thank you for your time Absor, and your excellent post Grim!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> :P :&gt;<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First of all i dont play a wiz, so i might be totally wrong here, i play a 37sk, but here is some of the things ive seen when i group with wiz.<P>Number one, no offence but when ever i group the last thing i ever invite is a wiz, i would rather take any other class, why? simple all wiz does in a group is med, that 1 nuke per mob dont help nearly as much as a healer or a melee class or a enchanter or a mage pet or a necro dot.<P>And from what i hear wiz arent that great at solo either so i see a definate problem here, in a group u have least contribution and u cant solo well.<P>Wiz is a class that obviosly has to nuke hard but! it has to be mana efficent, a mage nukes almost as hard and is almost as mana efficent and  a mage has a pet that helps with damage, this means while a wiz runs out his mana nuking so will the mage but the mages pet will still be going at it. This might not be true at higher lvls but at lvl 37 i see this all the time.<P>The solution is simple in my mind, wiz needs to be most mana efficent and most damaging nukers.<BR>the damage on wiz spells seems to be nice just the mana cost is too high, i sujjest mana cost be lowered.  Being a sk i am not sur ehow much i will leave that up to u wizies =P.  <P>Also maybe wiz could be givin a mana transfering spells, that transfer mana from the wiz to another player(healer would be the most popular choice) so in a icky situation a wiz can lend some mana to a cleric to heal the tank or something to that sort.<P>In addition wiz could also recive some self only mana regeneration boosting spells, that maybe lower there damage out put or increse casting time, so when soloing or in small groups the down time would be decreased<P>Well those are my thoughts, hope u like em =P<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>   Well, guys, I have been reading the posts for quite a while now and having played three wizards at three different times for so many days that you would suspect I live wired my brain in someway.  I did this to study the game and the players to build a better mousetrap someday.<P>   I am afraid that you all are gonna feel let down when this is over.  The game mechanics are so broken for the caster class in general, as to require now a new mob developement to bring the whole caster caster class up to par with the melee class.<P>   The pure caster is the wizard and the pure melee is the warrior, the rest of the classes are hybirds of these two primary.  Verant apparantly missed the basic balance equation from the beginning.  I dont think that their testing methods work at all.  They are clearly not controlled or scientifically undertaken in a way that would catch the problem of balance.  <P>    In the beginning it would have been simple considering the pure caster and the pure melee and the utility classes.  For perfect balance(almost impossible to acheive), if all 14 classes were grouped together fighting continous pulls for two hours, the uber group analysis of damage dealt should roughly 1/14 damage dealt over the period by the various classes including the utility classes.  <BR>  For example, when a cleric heals during battle then the hps healed associated with the corresponding damage dealt by the newly healed meleer would be cleric damage.  The pure utility of the cleric adds 100 per cent to the melee side of the damage equation as casters are rarely healed in the epic fights and are at best last on the list of heals.  The shaman, druid, and enchanter utility roles aid both sides of the equation but in a very unbalanced way.<P>    As Verant began to "fix" the other classes, it first started as equipment and weapons pre Kunark, which were not noticed so much in the unbalancing effect because not enough uber guild farming got them down the levels for a couple of months after introduction of the new equipment.<BR>  <BR>  The equivalent caster upgrades of equipment were clearly derived from a misconception about the game balance equation from the start.  In other words decrease the weapon delay a couple of pts and up the damage three or four and compare that to a caster item adding 10 manna.  The difference is laughable at best if it was not so pathethic.  Then came melee disciplines allowing more and faster melee damage with zero compensation on the caster side of equation.<P>  As the uber gear trickled down and the level 50 crowds grew bigger the game was coming to a grinding halt.  So, Verant attempts a fix based on the wrong premise by better weapons more levels and much more difficult mobs for the melee side of the equation further increasing the gap.  Over several months the newer gear trickled ever further down into the levels to further unbalance the 25 to 35 range so that it became more evident there.<P>   Enter velious and newer, more uber mobs and equipment.  Wonderful new caster equipment, with 50 manna increase.  Bah, like putting a bandaid on the six foot breach in the dam. How are they gonna fix this? They cant because they dont know what the problem is.  They focused on nerfing casters and ignoring them incessantly all the way through velious and are just now figuring out something aint working right.  The decline of caster players has brought something to their attention.<P>     And quit posting about what a mage or necro can do you cant do.  That problem can be addressed later if the basic caster melee balance is believed by verant then they can balance the caster side withing itself as well as the melee within itself.<P>   If the caster manna pool was increased by 25 percent today, I submit nothing would change. You still cant start blasting on the new mobs at 70 percent and live.  Go to sebilis at 55 and start casting one nuke in the 650 range on a sebalite level 56 to 58 and you are dead nine times out of ten.  Even at 60 percent you are likely to die even on a slow burn.  Dying at 90 per cent manna is futile.  Yep, you can contribute 25 percent more right?  Wrong, you cant cast it fast enough on the last half of regular mobs.  The caster taunt is out of proportion to the mob we now must fight, which can kill us in three to four seconds.<BR>A 60 warrior cant taunt him off fast enough.<P>   Uber mobs forget it.  Who needs a caster there?<BR>What about resists full and partial on blue mobs.  They are there so as to reduce the effective manna pool of casters along with fizzles that you would hardly notice the 25 percent increase in manna. <P>    But regular ole 4k to 6k mobs?  Whoa the game falls apart if you give casters anything for kunark dungeons. A number of dramatic changes are necessary and then redesign of the mobs lower than the uber mobs becomes necessary.  Sorry, but I dont believe thats gonna happen, and wizards will get some increases but you will be largely disappointed and there will be even less wizards six months down the road.<P>   AE spells?  I have played on live for over a hundred and twenty days and cant say that after 34, I ever saw a group anywhere fighting ae. A caster can only use these spells effectively on solo quad kiting for an insane amount of experience.  Is it fun? Yep for a little while till the monotony sets in.  But it is nice to spend less time leveling and then running around trying to get in groups for some real fun and epic encounters till you hit the uber mobs and realize that to be noticed you need six wizards at level 59 60 to make an impact on the rest of the crew.<P>  Face it guys, we are the only class that with two simple game changes, could be eliminated and the game would not miss a beat as it is currently played.  Make sky and hate like the other three planes and let shaman make cheaper gate potions so the poor druids dont get overtaxed on the taxi business.  This doesnt mean the wizard is the weakest caster class, it simiply suggests that this illustrates how far the melee class is overbalanced against the caster class.<P>  To fix it, we need a complete manna heal from a chanter equivalent to the cleric hp heal, with smaller manna heals early on and spread across more utility classes like shaman, druid,paladin,and ranger heal, not to mention item healing abilities.  <BR>  <BR>We have a company representative that doesnt understand the dynamics of the game. We have a company whose original vision has blurred dramatically and doesnt evidently realize exactly how the vast majority play the game.  From a complete dismissal of the causual player(If I were a numbers analyst, I would love to know how many people start up the game and then quit after a few months).  What does it mean when you have over 300,000 players and manage to sell about 15,000 or so velious expansion packs?<P>   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

We did a major amount of damage while melee's watched our backs and what was a major weapon that a Warrior would get before the Planes?...there big weapon was the Mith 2 hander if i remember right, well that and the old Yak but im looking for max damage  here. Very good points Stow,im only hoping that Verant sees the problem and is looking for the best way to fix it for all of us before we all give up a great class out of shear frustration.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sinneed, I see that you like playing your Wizard (at least part time), but you never explained why you feel Wizards are balanced.  You did say that "Playing a Wizzie is hard".  In what way?  Why is playing a Wizard hard?<P>Is it hard because we do less damage than almost all other classes?<BR>Is it hard because we are agroed on if we cast early in a fight, or chain cast?<BR>Is it hard because we need a well rounded group (warrior, enchanter, and cleric) to even think of using our AOE spells?<BR>Is it hard because many of our ports will kill us, and our group?<BR>Is it hard because if we are able to rapidly cast with the help of a good enchanter we are quickly OOM and need to set our for the next five or six pulls?<BR>Is it hard because many green mobs can kill us without difficulty (more so than any other class I have played)?<BR>Is it hard because there are levels when we are out DD by other classes?<BR>Is it hard because we have very few group friendly spells, and none that are unique?<BR>Is it hard because we are the class most effected by resists?<P><BR>Those are a few ideas.  Why is it hard?  It is not complicated like Enchanters (I also play and Enchanter).  I mean look at the spells Wizards get.  They can for the most part nuke, or AOE nuke (limited stun, and snare).  Wizards are rather simple that way.  All you need to know is not to nuke too soon, and you need a well oiled group to use AOE spells.  You will learn that quickly as a young Wiz (so will the group the young Wiz is in).<P>I think if you take a good look at Wizards and other classes you will see that they are hard to play for one simple reason.  They are not balanced.<P>They have the least protection.  The area in which Wizards are suppose to be the king is direct damage, but many other casting classes can do direct damage as well or almost as well.  If you factor in Malise, Magicians are often more efficient and do more damage with their DD spells, and they get the best pets in the game.  Now tell me how this is balanced.  Druids' DDs are close in power to the Wizards' as well, and they get a ton of other group friendly spells (now they are likely to be even better healers than they are now).  I don't see the balance here.<P>Sinneed (or anyone), explain to me how Wizards are balance.  Sure they can do damage and can be useful at times, but that is not what we are talking about.  Yes Wizards are playable.  Yes they can be fun to play.  No they are not balanced.<P>Oh, Sinneed you said "Ya, what is up with these lobie MOBs with high resistance?  Impacts all classes.  Change the MOBs instead, please."  I agree with you here, but what class do you think is most impacted?  Wizards.  When we are resisted what can we do?  Nothing.  We can't buff, we can't heal, but we can sit on our butt and do nothing.  Again I do not see the balance. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>NEW BALANCE IDEA:<P>Purple (group) AoE's<P>An AoE type spell that does various dd AoE dmg FROM EACH GROUPMEMBER..  The more members the more damage, and the spell would radiate from each player.  This would not be a solo type spell since it would only hit once from yourself the caster.  <P>Lets say that at lvl 44 you get Ring of Fire, that does 175 dmg AoE that acts like a PB AoE from each groupmember simultaneously.  The spell would cost about 370 or so mana, which is quite a bit at that level.  With 6 members it would hit the mob, assuming no half or full resists, for approx 1000 dmg.<P>This would also create an easy solution to the aggro gripe that many casters have concerning AoE's.  The aggro would now be spread evenly through every groupmember (causing possible scenarios, but not near as bad as full aggro onto the wizard.)<P>I hope this is considered, it would definately be a spell I would like to use, and I'm pretty sure most groupmembers wouldnt mind being able to get a chance to be a part of a wizards awesome power. /snicker<P><BR>~Arkaan 45th Wizard.<BR>~Bristlebane.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alot of honest people posting here, that clearly see the balance problems that are relavent with the class.<P>However to say that the class can not be fixed is wrong, IMO.<P>Do all are spells need reworked? NO. Only have a hand full of "good" spells.<P>Do we need new spells added? NO. Most spells we get are totally worthless, or only useful in "perfect" conditions so not worth memming anyway.<P>Do we need Rains spells fixed? Sure, not going to balance us though, unless the tank can manage to pull one mob everytime, every other class has rains to though.<P>Do we need portal locations fixed? sure, not going to balance us though. Just less of a inconvience.<P>Will Percentage Damage spells balance us? No, but might work on 1 percent of the new velious mobs, does nothing to address current balance issues in the old world though. Still need to finish mobs with Traditional nukes.<P>We need a bigger mana pool? No, would only help us nuke a few more times, back to same old thing again, maybe solo something bigger then as well.<P>Spells need to do more Damage at one time. NO, Faster + Cheaper + similar damage to other classes = More control, less resistance, less unneccessary Taunting. The spells are perfect the way they are.<P>We need are spells resisted less? Sure, not going to balance us though.<P>We need pets or anything close? Alot of wizards dont want a pet, and Im one of them.<P>Whats left then?<P>We all want to do more damage!<P>To compensate for the lack of ability to add damage in any other form then use mana, we need to regain mana at least twice as fast as any other Offensive caster is capable of. Why is because we are currently more then half as far behind any other Offensive caster.<P>Simple fix for the Masters of Direct Damage or Quick Damage.<P>1x meditation lvl 4-19<BR>2x meditation lvl 20-39<BR>3x meditation lvl 40-59<BR>4x meditation lvl 60<P>with this in the game, a wizard would still have to meditate in the high level game, but would still take this Wizard at level 60 approx 3 to 4 mins to med back to full.<P>Wizards wouldnt be a crappy class to play which most of the time being spent doing nothing, but would be fun, a caster version doing Rogue like damage to a mob.<P>57 Wizard of the Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
