&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>OK i have to admit that I havent read many of the posts here.  But I've been thinking about the issue of balance.  Balance is something that is hard to measure, I think the easiest way to to compare 2 classes.  The problem with this is that it can be perceived as "class envy," or it may be that the other class is overpowered.  But in any case, I dont see a better way but to do a comparisson.  I think the most obvious one is between wizards and druids.  I choose druids as they are the only other class than can teleport.<P>So that said lets look at some areas of each class<P>DD spells: Wizards are clearly stronger here, although not by a margin that makes druid dd spells look weak.<P>AE spells: Again Wizards are clearly stronger here, although not by a margin that makes druid AE spells look bad.  The Jyll's line for wizards is excellent and standsout.<P>Teleports: close, but I think druids get the edge overall.  Whatever lets call it a draw for the purpose of trying to make my point.<P>Heals: heheh not much arguement here.  Wiz get none.  Im not going to add changes that are being discussed on the test server.<P>AC/Health Buffs: wiz gets no group buffs at all.  Druids get some excellent group buff spells.  True wizards get ok self buffs, but that doesnt help finding a group<P>Resist Buffs:  Druids get significantly better buffs here.  Wiz gets elemental armor at 44 but thats about it.  Also wiz buffs are self only again.<P>Damage Shield:  no contest here.  O'keils isnt much use.<P>Snare:  Interesting area.  Druids get snare at level 1, wizards get an AE snare at 29th.  For some reason druids dont get an AE snare until 50+ but whatever.  Wizard version is also very short in duration.  Edge druids.<P>Root:  I have to admit my knowledge of druid root spells is poor, but i'd give the edge to wizards here.  but then again, casting root is pretty rare when your 50+ and in a group.<P>Pets:  Druids get that bear pet at 50+ (which is very cool btw) wizards dont really get a pet (flaming sword doesnt really count)<P>Melee skills: Wizards skill caps are significantly lower than those of druids.<P>Im sure there are areas I havent covered, but I think overall its clear that druids are the more well rounded class.  Let me make one thing clear.  I play a wizard, and I dont want to heal.  I not asking that wizards get all kinds of new abilities.  I just dont see that our DD/AE spells are that much better than all of the other abilities that a druids gets such that things are balanced.  Dont get me wrong, I wouldnt trade my wiz in for a druid if you offered me the chance.<P>I do think wizards should get better resist buffs, and make them group friendly.  Since we are the masters of fire/cold/magic DD why would it not make sense for us to be the masters of resisting those things?<P>Beyond that Im not sure what the right fixes are, Im sure there are LOTS of great idea what my fellow wizzys have posted here.  <P>Flame on if you want, I was just thinking about balance outloud.  Sorry for any rambling.<P>Emirikal Fyrewynd<BR>58th Evoker Druzzil Ro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've been thinking about comparing the recent test server changes, and how they parallel the wizard dilemma.  Consider:<P>Warriors take damage only a little better than paladins/shadowknights, but they deal damage much better.  Warriors deal less damage than rogues, monks, and rangers, but they take damage much better.  So, warriors have rivals for tanking ability, but those rivals don't come close in damage output.  And warriors have superiors in damage dealing, but those classes don't come close in damage absorption.<P>Let's say magical damage is in two areas, too: fast damage (emergencies) and endurance damage (sustained lesser amounts).  Wizards do fast damage only a little better than their closest rivals (mages and druids), but they have much better endurance damage.<P>Ack--no they don't!<P>The fundamental problem in a nutshell.  My brand new suggestions (I would not want to see all of them):<P>* Rogues have rivals for damage dealing (monks, primarily), but the rogue is better able to deal that damage *safely*, because of evade--what if wizard blasts inherently caused less monster aggression?  They would be able to unload earlier on a bad pull, giving them an entirely new advantage over their closest rivals.<P>* Better endurance damage--enhanced specialization, new highly mana-efficient blasts with a longish recast time (so only one could be cast on a typical pull), or the idea of going "mana-berserk" and having better mana regeneration when at 40% mana (the idea being you could either have a large reserve, OR put out consistent damage)<P>* Just bigger and badder--general increases in size, speed, and (maybe) mana-efficiency, so that the wizard's closest rivals are less close (my least favorite).<P>Lastly, my standard closing: Wizards have definite problems, but they're STILL underrated =P</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, my other idea.<P><BR>Since Wizards have a "Thirst for Knowledge" make quests set at certain spell lvls, like starting at 8 or 12, that the wizard has to quest to become more efficient in mana, have great dmg per spell, cast faster, and get less resistance.  <P>Wizards could seek out masters that give them advice and actually spawn monsters that the master will make u fight that requires a certain strategy at different parts of the game.  Make the masters speak in ALL different kinds of languages so that the wizard would have to know ALL languages to complete certain spell lvl Master's quests.  Make books drop in all languages that tell the wizard how to find the next master, or prepare something for the master.<P><BR>Maybe at lvl 16, a master will teach the Wizard an ability (much like bind wound) that can increase the magicial efficiency, speed of spell, increase the dmg, and lower resistances on OTHER caster's spells.  An ability able to be used 5 times every 40 minutes...and the effect would last an hour.  This way when a wizard joins a group, his knowledge on how to cast would increase the magicial effects of a group...including allowing clerics to cast heal spells faster, etc.  <P><BR>I posted this message b4, and i'm only skimming over the idea as Absor prolly doesn't wanna read in detail again.  This and the part 1 of my post are things i believe would make the wizard wanted in groups.  There might be a few things still needing improvement, but this WOULD make us a solid class.  (I'll post the link to the page my old idea was on under this post so u can read it in detail.)<P><BR>Krytal.<P><BR>P.S.: I dunno, I like these ideas...i'm wondering if i'm getting any support from my fellow wizards?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have been thinking about this long and hard....<P><BR>Being only a 35th wizard, I can not comment much about the higher end game, because I have not experienced it yet.<P>The things I find imbalancing with the Wizard Class are as follows:<P>1) The level cap for full resists.  I frequently hunt with guild members who range from 34 - 44, and if the puller is high end and pulling blacks or yellows, I am completely and utterly useless.<P>2) Plain everyday resists - These happen way too often, even with my Staff of Temperate Flux, I find I get resisted partially or fully a good part of the time even by blue cons.<P>3) Mana regeneration - Too slow to recover, considering that we have nothing else to fall back on... and even unable to sit and med in some cases because the mob will taunt on you.  (Not to mention the silly green mobs will aggro on you when you do med at times.  When medding I still get aggroed on by Orcs of all levels and animals)<P>4) Having to drop 3 or more spell circles to use a spell.  I still keep Shock of Lightning or Lightning bolt memmed because the All or nothing Force Shock or Thunder Strike are too erratic to use, and not having a lightning based magical spell until 39, means that I am limited to 83 or 125 damage rather than something comparable to Ice Shock or Inferno Shock if I need to resort to those spells.<P>5) Being out damaged by another classes spells... <P>Again, this should never happen, but it does...  I have lived with it this long, but it is something that can be fixed.<P>AE spells, rarely use.  Not in groups with more than one AE caster usually... But I have used my Al'Kabor spells once... and realized how completely useless they are, and relegated them to the back of my spellbook.   <P>I hope Absor is listening, because there have been many valid points on these 7 posts now, and I have found the discussion very interesting for the most part.<P>Davar Talesian<BR>Wizard of the 35th circle - Torvonnilous<BR>Veeshan's Nemesis</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Nostromo:<P>Well I fall under that category. I am not pleased with the Wizard class right now ...even tho many of my friends just want me to gain levels to join them. Course they do not know the Wizard class like I do. I find joy every now and then but mostly thru adventuring with friends.<P>So why am I here? ...b/c I want my Wizard to be something a little closer to what I had imagined it would be.

</FONT><HR>Sinneed, you know at 52 I thought I was pretty good as well, but that was mainly because of mob encounters like overking, vs and trak. <P>Sometimes when hearing about wizards telling they love their class and are balanced I ask myself if I do something wrong. I mean, is there a hidden secret of power some wizards know about that I don't?<P>But then I realize I have over 130 days played on mine and know that my fellow guild wizards/members that I respect think as well. If you are convinced that wiz is a great class more power too you, but I fail to see how you can be anything else than kidding yourself. <P>What is it exactly that you do? I read another post by a happy wiz who claimed he didn't do damage but he saw his role as a class who took care of emergancies. But at the lvl I play there are very few of those. Either you have a good strategy and will best the mob or you will fail, it's as simple as that.<P>Some of these people on this thread who say that there are balancing problem with the wiz class aren't just your average wiz. They are known players in the wiz community and have played their class for years. Who are you again?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Im only reading what Alan posted....but it seems identical to wizard talk six. Well, yes, this board is going to attract ppl that want to talk about bugs, wishes, etc. (like mine would be making a decent visual than the ice crystal staff for the gnarled staff).....but that is for otherpost and is just wish stuff.<P>Things that make us unbalanced:<P>1. Velious uber mobs are high HPs and we run out of mana without making a signifigant contribution. We still get invited to raids, but if given the choice between us and most other class, we would not be chosen now as we cant buff, tank..... or do a proportionate amount of damage to compensate. Verant has promised that this is being looked into and Im interested in seeing what the solution will be.<P>2. Compared to rogues, our speed of damage output isnt hugely advantagous when considering a rogue can put out damage non-stop while we must med large amounts of time.<P>3. Compared to Mages/Necros.....we do have the fast damage, but mages are similar and necros can eventually far exceed us if the battle is prolonged. That is when they dont have a pet, the pet factor far outweighs our bonus in mana efficiency/recast. <P>4. Lastly, we dont have anything other than damage to make us wanted by a casual groups. Evac you say? Most groups dont plan on failure, so dont think...gee, evac is absolutely nessessary. It is at best seen as a nice convenience. But you went and gave call of hero to mages? I will never understand that. How about giving us SOMETHING that a group can actually use. I will never see this, but how about giving us a spell that ports a MOB back to the bind point with a mem blur? Save vs magic and if save fails then mob doesnt port...a train making spell wouldnt be a group friendly skill. We'll never see it, but a thought.<P>Oh well, just my two coppers about balance issues.<P>Sarmaldor<BR>Wizard of the 58th circle</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sinneed, sorry I still disagree with you.<P>We are most effected by high resists.  Say you are in a group an come up against a mob/mobs with high resists what can a Wizard do?  Not a whole lot.  Wizards can spend a ton of mana and do a little damage with a ton of agro.  Wizards are the only class limited like this (I think Enchanters are a close second).<P>You were talking about Shaman.  Ya, resists hurt their ability to damage a mob, but they have many other spells that can help a group like healing (soon to be even better), many types of buffs, and a pet (yes not a great pet, but it can still help).  I do think that Shaman also need a little improvement by the way.<P>Your paly that was the weakest is being improved as we speak.  Why?  Because they were not balanced.  All the hybrids needed improvements, and are getting them.<P>I am not saying Wizards are weak or useless.  I just do not feel they are balanced.  I can not see that they are.  We can out damage many classes in a very short period of time.  That is it.  So we are set up well for kill steeling, but not for long term fights.  Yes like you said we are forced to stand in the back and cast a spell or two at the end of a fight.  In this way we can save the tanks a few hitpoint and thus the Cleric a little mana, but by exchanging us for one of many other classes they could have done more damage over a longer period of time without waiting for us to med.<P>You seem to be mistaking your feeling of "fun to play" with balanced.  Fun to play is subjective.  Everyone has a class that they feel is fun to play.  I think Wizards are fun to play.  I just can not see the balance.<P>Sinneed if you like Wizards now just think what you would think if they had the power they should have.  The power to contribute to any fight, and the power to add something to a group that no other class can.  All we have are nukes.  We should be second to none at any level.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

No need to be cute or try to slight me because I disagree.  It is ok to just disagree.<P>I have played since November 28, 1999.  An average of 6 hours per day.  I have every class but bard and monk.  I have played only 2 chars to above lvl 50.  Yes, many respected folks (including friends of mine, in game and out) disagree about the wizard class being unbroken, valuable in groups, fun to play and deadly at all levels.  Some have left the game after trying a few other classes and wanting a wizard, but being unwilling to accept the narrow, narrow role.<P>Most of these whines (yep) are about the game at all levels.<P>I have said several times that I have only played a wizzie to 52.

</FONT><HR>Ive calculate the numbers and posted them here before, though they are long buried under a pile of posts and splits.<P>Simply put the best way to balance wizards would be to put the following abilities into the skill section at the Wizard Trainer.<P>1x Meditation lvl 4-19 (21 points per tick max.)<BR>2x Meditation lvl 20-39 (42 points per tick max.)<BR>3x Meditation lvl 40-59 (64 points per tick max.)<BR>4x Meditation lvl 60 (84 points per tick max.)<P>given current mana regen rates at level 57.(full burn)<P>1x med = approx 13 minutes of downtime<BR>2x med = approx 7 minutes of downtime<BR>3x med = approx 5 minutes of downtime<P>estmated Downtime at level 60.(full burn)<BR>4x med = approx 3 minutes of downtime<P>Why is 12-13 minutes of Downtime concidered "balanced" for the wizard class, but not so for almost every other "Offensive INT" caster.<P>I dont think the other classes needed nerf to share are suffering, think Verant needs to get off the high horse and implement the fix.<P>If Wizards are going to be the only "PURE non- melee caster, they need to be able to get there mana back at a MUCH FASTER rate then any Offensive INT based caster. Pets 50+ cast useful spells and Melee and take damage about as good as any Warrior.<P>Giving Wizards Pets is not the answer, giving us the ability to get back into the battle faster is.<P>If implementing the above rates becomes over-powering due to current in-game buffs then fine.<P>a) Breeze, Clarity, Clarity II would no longer take hold on wizards, higher then level 40.<P>b) Bard Mana songs would no longer have positive mana regen effect on wizards higher then level 40.<P>c) Remove the Harvest from the game, and remove the 1 and 3 point mana regen buffs from the skin buffs.<P>So now the above sounds like a nerf and a twink. Wizards would have in there own abilities the means of which to do semi-steady DD to mobs in a group, and if they ever choose to do the borring thing of soloing, would half the downtime, guess something has to give somewhere.<P>From my perspective 12-13 minutes of Downtime is unacceptable.<P>Why does Melee own compared to Magic users?<BR>Why is because Healing spells can take a near Out of Mana(hitpoints) Warrior and give him or her a full tank in 12 seconds or whatever the cast time is for Complete Heal. Im totally fine with that actually, dont nerf a good thing, when it comes to balance though, wizards scrape the bottom of the barrel due to Mana regen issues that have never been address realistically. Comeone wheres my Complete Mana regen Cleric, a OOM Wizard is about as useful as a Out of hitpoints Tank.<P>If yours going to allow Pets to Duel Wield, Stun, Lifetap, Root, Backstab, etc, etc. You are shorting the Wizard class out of half the damage the other Offensive INT based casters are capable of.<P>Whats a compelling reason to play a wizard? Only reason is so that I can teleport around and Evac people here and there. Which might mean something if Wizards where the only class able to do it. However Druids are just a capable if not more capable of taking people where they want to go. Im fine with that fact to.<P>Not fine with the 12-13 minutes of downtime between battles though.<P>IMO, DONT EVEN BOTHER FIXING THE FOLLOWING cause they dont matter to balance what so ever.<P>Evac locations - Cazic, Skyfire, I dont care im over it, I dont go there without alot of friends.<P>Damage Shields - Never used them not about to start.<P>Root/Enstill etc - Who cares, snare and root stack, they didnt before, already "fixed".<P>Al'Kabor spells are crap - just remove them from the game, Jyll's line is the best match for any AE group.<P>Rain spells - Dont have much use for these spells, resists are to high, to risky to use like I want to use them with a swarm of mobs around.<P>Messed up spell graphics - lol, Ya there something meaningful to complain about.<P>Fizzle rates - Hum lets see, if Im purely Offensive class, and I regain mana at a modified rate of 64 points of mana every 6 seconds(when I sit), fizzle rates are not going to bother me quite so much.<P>Resist Rates - See above, would be like the eqivalant of a Rogue missing a Backstab due to whatever, about the same frequency as well.<P>Sight spells Gaze etc. - Who cares, never use these spells anyway, only used to get your skill in Divination up, so you dont fizzle like crasy casting Invis and See Invis, Ultravision etc.<P>Fade/Shadowstep/Yonder - Who cares, use these to practice Alteration with so roots "work" better.

</FONT><HR>Another balance issue I didn't see mentioned directly is how our spells scale as the levels go up, especially in the 51+ range.  Looking at the level 51+ spells, we have the following:<P>Draught of Fire:  Level 51, does 643 damage at level 51 for 215 mana, cast time 3 seconds.<P>Voltaic Draught:  Level 54, does 658 damage at level 54 for 215 mana, cast time 3 seconds.<P>Draught of Jiva:  Level 55, does 663 damage at level 55 for 215 mana, cast time 3 seconds.<P>Draught of Ice:   Level 57, does 716 damage at level 57 for 215 mana, cast time 3 seconds.<P><BR>Note that the above scale up VERY slowly, and except for draught of ice, increase by only 5 damage per level for what is virtually the same spell.  In this time, how many more THOUSANDS of hit points do the mobs get?<P>The lure line is even worse:<P>Lure of frost, does 640 damage at level 52 for 320 mana with a casting time of 4.5 seconds.<P>Lure of flame, does 640 damage at level 55 for 320 mana with a casting time of 4.5 seconds.<P>Lure of lightning, does 680 damage at level 58<P>Lure of ice, does 825 damage at level 60 for 320 mana with a casting time of 4.5 seconds.<P>Look at that, the damage is flat for the lure line, with a minor 40 more at 58, but then a sudden jump of 145 damage at level 60.  Still, the mobs increase their hit points significantly over this period, while the damage output is flat.<P><BR>Now, the following is the final set, the pillar line.  I won't worry about the PB AoE spells for this.<P>Pillar of frost, does 755 damage at level 51 to 4 mobs with a cost of 325 mana in 4.5 seconds.<P>Pillar of lightning, does 828 damage at level 54 to 4 mobs with a cost of 344 mana in 4.5 seconds.<P>Pillar of Flame, does 937 damage at level 57 to 4 mobs with a cost of 364 mana in 4.5 seconds.<P><BR>Note that the pillar line scales up MUCH better than our direct damage spells.<P>The point blank spells:<P>Jyll's Static Pulse does 495 damage at level 53 to all in a radius around the caster with a cost of 285 in 2 seconds.<P>Thunderbold does 600 damage at level 54 to all in a radius around the caster, pushes the mobs back, and stuns for 3 seconds with a cost of 300 mana in 3 seconds.<P>Jyll's Zephyr of Ice does 594 damage at level 56 to all in a radius around the caster with a cost of 313 mana in 2 seconds.<P>Jyll's Wave of Heat does 638 damage at level 59 to all in a radius around the caster with a cost of 342 mana in 2 seconds.<P><BR>There are level 60 spells, but it is far from the same line as these short cast time spells, with high cast times.  Level 60 spells are an upgrade of the level 49 spells overall, and should not be lumped in for comparison purposes.  Note that the area of effect spells increase their damage PER MOB, more than the DD spells.  This is an issue to be looked at.  Even then, it is obvious that the increase per level in damage for the point blank spells is NOT consistant with the nice upgrades in the pillar line.   Something needs to be adjusted to scale our spells.  <P>Please note that unlike ALL other classes, there is no item that increases our damage output.  Focus items are there to improve the pets summoned, and even though rare and difficult to find, their abilities go up notably with them.  Nothing for the wizard class to do the same thing.  Just pointing out a fact, it's not envy.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Gentlemen and Ladies.  I hate to say this but I am finally giving up on my Wizard.  After over a year of playing and hitting level 52.  They try and cover up and wont discuss our damage output.  They tried to tell us how necessary we would be to planes raids and how many planes need a Wizard to get there??  Answer Hate and Sky.  They may have thought they could make this class viable in the begining.  Now I think they would prefer if we went away.  The lack of responses from Absor or anyone with a blue name in this forum has totally blown my hopes for my class.  I became a Wizard to be a NUKER.  I wanted to be a D&D style Wizard at the high levels.  Something that was feared not ridiculed.  A true Wizard throwing his magic around is an awfull site to behold.  I know we cant be Elminsters or Merlins for lack of better examples, but when we are consistently out performed by other classes in the "Magical Damage Dept" its very disheartening.  The fact that I sit 3/4's of the time medding and am mostly needed for Taxi service around Norrath is growing old.  Grimstaff my hat is off to you for being so persistent on trying to get changes made.  I hope someday they will make the changes necessary to make us viable but I dont see it coming.  Absor's posts at the start of this has shown me the light I guess.  I want to be a Wizard.  I dont want to be able to solo Trak or anything like that.  I want to be a viable member of my group.  I want people to say hey a Wizard we can use him.  I guess I want to be what we are supposed to be.  The Masters of Magical Damage.  Yes the Warrior Class of the Casters,  You want a mob dead fast sic me on it.  With the way things are looking they just dont seem to care about this class anymore.  I hope and pray I am wrong and will check back on this thread when it hits part 17 or so.  Maybe by then we can have another 2 blue name responses.<P>52 Wizard Quellious Server Retired  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Everquest is a very easy game, Norrath is a static world. What u do the most of the time is fighting or go to a place, where u can fight. By walking u wont get xp, so to advance u have to fight. That’s why almost everything in Everquest is based on combat or travelling, the game is more a struggle then a quest, Evercombat would fit more.<P>U have only two basic facts, that are important for a fight, damage u do and damage u take over the time. Almost all spells in the game are supporting that two basic facts, like buffing, debuffing, snare, healing, damage shields, fear and even clarity is supporting that.<P>So the goal of a “good” (not fun) fight is, to make as much damage as u can and try to avoid damage as long u fight. Normally u fight constant, if the puller and the group knows their job and of cause there are enough mobs around.<BR>If u keep that in mind, its getting interesting.<BR>(wake up the post starts now)<P>Damage u make:<BR>U have two ways to do damage in a fight, melee and magic. Melee damage is for free, there is no limit to use it. Magical damage casted on mobs is only useful, if u would do as much or more damage in a fight as a melee type would do. If a caster wants to do that, the mana he used must be back at least in the time, when the melee type is getting the same damage for the spell he did. No Caster in the game is doing that, except for the possibility of area spells. So for single mobs the better damage dealer is a melee one (pets included). The best way to use mana as a damage spell, is to enhance the combat abilities of the tanks.<P>Damage u take:<BR>The second fact u have to take care for, is the damage u get in a fight. To do this, u have many ways magical ones and tank wise. For example u can snare and fear a mob and then beat it up, u can just snare it and spell it from the distance, just tank it like a man, buff and heal up when needed and much more. But there is one fact, that will make sure, u take less hits and that is, when u get the mobs single. As long u have only one mob fighting, the max damage u take is limited by that one mob. So the goal of taking damage is to fight mobs not in a horde, but single. Monks are designed for that goal, as well are chanters or any other crowd control.<P>Result:<BR>The main goal of a fight if u tank and have to take hits is to get the mobs single. Strong mobs with much hit points and with hard blows points that out very clear. U will never pull a pack of Cazic Thules only to use area spells. Long fights, like the ones now in Velious showed it very clearly, but its not only there it is everywhere, cause a good group with constant pulls is like one long fight, except u can give yourself a break, for example when the healer is afk. <P>Classes:<BR>What does the two upper facts means for the classes…..<BR>For the melee types one single mob works best, cause they can still do the damage on one mob, they would do with more then one mob. Make max damage and take min damage. They also bring in the ability to tank the mobs.<BR>All casters who can support melee types in a fight are useful as well with heals, buffs, debuffs, damage shields, etc. and also casters, that have a pet to join works all fine on a single mob. Its no question, it is much better for a cleric to heal the group, if u have only one mob then multiple.<BR>But what about a class, using only direct damage to support a group, no other ability to boost the tanks or weaken the mobs, no pet to through in ?<BR>Well, there is only one answer, area spells, but that is a problem for the rest of the group in many ways. First u need a special group for that, the right classes, advanced players, a willing group to risk area spells, the right place and and and….<BR>But even if u got this all set, there is one reason u should not use area spells in a group, u work against the abilities of the other classes to make damage and take damage. The damage the group takes grows with multiple mobs if u don’t stun them but let all tanks take one. And if u stun them with an enchanter in the group, u waste the ability of the tanks, to do damage for no mana, cause u have to kill them very quick and boost much mana in the area spells to kill them all.<P>When u compare the usefulness of Classes for a group or raid, u always have in mind, how much more damage the group makes and how less damage the group gets with the class. That is the main problem of the Wizards, the game design is not made for area spells like they are now. Even the ones we need most the enchanters to boost our mana and for area stuns have the ability for crowd control to fight the mobs single.<P>So what is left for us. We are useful on raids, where we can fight a major mob, that has not that much HP but hits hard. When we go into the fight with full mana, we can dumb our spells and help to bring the mob down fast. But that is not working on mobs with much HP like in Velious and in a group with constant pulls.<BR>We can solo and quad kite with our spells, but first that is not much fun, is only outside and hard for low or very high level wizards.<BR>In a group we have our uses, but others classes can do it much better, cause we don’t work well together with them.<P>What can help us Wizards is everything, that makes us more useful against single mobs or make the game more friendly to area spells. There are much solutions whoed up for this, like more damage with less mana, group buffs, etc. Some solutions would be a big inpact for our solo ability.<BR>The other way is to make area spells more useful for other classes, but that would be a major change to the game system.<P>That’s why there will be no changes for us Wizards, Verant still points out our area spells and almost no groups are using them for several reasons.<BR>So it will be a dream, to see groups shouting for a wizard, I am lucky I have friends.<P>My vote is, take all our snare, damage shields, invis to undead, usless knowledge spells, all that stupied evacs but the one to south ro and also all area spells not working on a single mob. U can all have it in my mind, but give me for that useful and powerful single damage spells with less mana.<P>the drunken Wizard,<BR>Lorfinduil<P> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I played em all as well, but most didn't reach lvl 15. And I have seen people who say they got like 5 lvl 50 chars and claim to be experts and they are just pathetic.<P>I have a 51 monk, but I have always played him twinked (why would I want to collect coppers again?) and therefor I could solo alot cause he had good gear. Not saying I never grouped or anything, but I didn't really 'earn my levels' like I know other people did. Therefor I usually consider myself a wiz first and monk second. I don't claim to be a better monk than others, but I sure as hell think I am a good wiz.<P>Not saying you don't know anything heh, but you know what I mean.<P>Anyways, feel free to answer my other questions.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I can't seem to find one.<P>One note I would like to make, someone mention that they would like to see Wizards made "a class that has no rivals" again.  That is not what I am really looking for.  What I want, is to be a class that is wanted.<P>Simply put, when I walk into the Dreadlands and OOC, "44 Wiz seeks group."  I want to receive a reply.  As it stands now, I am reduced to soloing in the Yeti caves if my regular group members from my guild are not on, or already have a full party.<P>Verant, hats off for a wonderful game, but make some of the corrections list by Grimstaff and others.  I would go along way to making many Wizards feel needed, and help to revitalize their interest in the game.<P>I know that over the course of the last two months, my own interest in playing has been waning.  Why you ask?  It is a great game, you exclaim!  Simply because it is becoming increasingly boring.  Yup, I said it.....the class I love is boring to play because I cannot socialize as the vision dictates.<P>/em hops off of soapbox.<P>Kelsen Ragingfury - Luclin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Read Grimstaff's and Stow's posts carefully (excepts the bit about moving the WK portal, leave it alone please).<P>One thing I wish to reiterate from an earlier post of mine though that I feel has been neglected by other posters here is a spell along the lines of the following:<P>Lvl 29 spell [insert name here]<BR>mana cost = 10<BR>type = direct damage<BR>resist = necro lifetap save<BR>damage = 100 + 10 per level over 29 (max 400)<BR>casting time = 2 seconds<BR>recast time = 12 seconds<P>purpose/effect = grind group spell; allowing the wizard to pull his or her weight in both high frequency pull groups, and ubermob megahealth raids.<P>How I see it working in practice:<BR>1. vs velious ubermob = appropriate lure, this spell, med, this spell, med, lure, med, this spell, med, etc etc.<P>2. vs grind group mobs = some variation according to mob type and wizard preference in group makeup, but basically some casting, then, this spell, med, this spell, med, etc, with big burn from normal arsenal where needed, eg overpull, quick finishing, whatever; added benefit, after big burn from overpull or whatever reason, next mob can be faced by this spell, med, this spell, med, etc - hence still contributing fair share to battle rather than just sitting out one or two mobs in three.<P>Bottom line = 1. would NOT help soloing measurably;<BR>2. would NOT require any increase to mana pool;<BR>3. would NOT require any mana regen spells or abilities;<BR>4. would NOT require any cheesy pseudo-pets;<BR>5. would NOT require any major programming or overhauls or expensive coding labour.<P>1. would make wizard acceptable in group as would be seen to pull weight;<BR>2. would help vs annoying noxp green med-interrupting mobs;<BR>3. would help offset downtime woes for a class that has otherwise NO downtime means of contributing in a fight;<BR>4. would simply and quickly help redress the biggest wizard balance issue(s) over the bulk of the wizard's career.<P>I believe this would negate any need of radical ideas such as the percent damage in velious idea, yet be found universally appealing for the class without stomping on ANY other class's toes and without overpowering the wizard in any way at any level.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Of course the spell focuses on the Wiz at 29+.  I think Grim covered lower levels well.<P>Note very carefully the most important aspects I'm talking about here:<P>Mana Cost, Resist Rate, Damage, Casting Time, and Recast Time.<P>In a post 50 wiz example, say the wiz regains mana medding at 21 mana per tick.<P>If the spell costs 10mana, that allows one cast (at 2 sec cast, very fast) then time to med a net gain of mana before next cast is possible.<P>The recast works to prevent aggro.  The damage is poor but significant over time, since the casting cost allows the wizard to keep on keeping on even in perpetual near-oom conditions.<P>I personally think necro lifetaps and wiz lures should both be pretty much equally unresistable except by the type of mob that resists that type of damage.  I also think this proposed spell should fit in this resist category.<P>Finally note carefully the damage range according to wiz level.<P>This allows this one spell to fill the gaping hole that wizzies have that so many posts here are trying to suggest ideas to fill.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There are a lot of things that are not being considered here.<P>Primary nuking:<BR>we have a wider variety of spell classes available.  Many times an Enchanter or Mage get resisted far more often than Wizards.  Yes, we get resisted and it sucks when that happens.  But, if you find the right spell for the MoB we have a much better resistance ratio.  Added with a marignally better mana ratio, and overall are far better.<P>I think there is too much concern over the damage/mana ratio put together by people who don't really know the numbers, who probably tend to try to chain cast the biggest nuke and then whine about the result.<P>Mana regen:<BR>This is simply a matter of strategy.  I can always find the right rythm in a group without clarity where I regularly have 60 mana and time to med.  Clarity is helpful, but it is certainly not a necessity.<P>Grouping problems:<BR>Don't know what to say here.  I'm level 35 now, play a Dark Elf who worships Solusek.  I must have the worst factions in the game.  But I can always get a group.  But then, I'm not constantly yelling that I'm OOM or whining because we have no Enchanter.  I nuke at the right moments, I use low damage old spells for regular damage, so I cast very often.  I am also not a twink, in some way, I have earned every piece of equipment on me.  I roleplay and I am friendly.  I play a Wizard.  I am always in a group.  I never feel like I'm not contributing.  I have often asked my fellow groupmates for honest opinions on wizard and so far noone said  anything to the effect that we don't contribute.  My groups seem to appreciate me.<P>Maybe it comes down to attitude and play styles.<P>Seekers of Knowledge:<BR>We are Master Seekers of Knowledge.  No doubt.  And as such, there should only be a few of us.  So if you don't like your wizard, why are you playing it?  Leave the skill to the few who have learned how it should be used.  Don't claim to have answers you can't have - you are not invloved in the mechanics.<P>Balance:<BR>When I play in a group I feel like I'm pretty balanced overall.   Though it seems to me that some sort of ability to regen mana a bit better would fit with Wizard schema.  But I also never solo.  I'm usually in a group pretty quickly so it's not been an issue.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OK, fist off, when I started playing EQ, my fist char was a wizard, but found it a ridiculously hard class to play, and have since tried pretty much all the other classes.<P>I managed to get my wiz up to level 12, but gave up as it was far too hard to level. No groups want you at higher levels, except for plane raids - wonder why? <P>Anyway, how about having more items like the soloists icy wand which has a right click spell in it? Mana free casting (much like the JBB) is something very useful, and may help a wizard contribute more.<P>You could make these as quests, and have a long cast time/recast time, or limit the level that you can use it. Fair enough, make it no drop, and you have to hand in the first wand to get the next, along with other things?<P>If you think back to the old fiction books, wizards used wands, and staffs to channel their power through, so it should fit in with the game.<P>If this could be put in the game, I might be more inclined to go back to my wizard for a second attempt.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I can't talk for all the Wizards out there but i like what Belissa said in her post about the way we are played. I have a friend that played a Wizard after the game was released( i was a Ranger at that time) and told me he was really intrigued with the Wizard class because of there power and what they can do...he played the class to 14 and has never come back(he's playes a Paladin now), I on the other hand  have played one past 50 and have had a great time (and still do)playing him.<P>In a nuttshell, some people play there class for all the wrong reasons and when it seems there not working the way they want that class to work its someone else's fault(meaning Verant)and not there own because they expected one thing and got something else or don't fully understand the class and what it can do.<P>Please understand Im not saying that everyone thats posting here about what is needed to make us better or more balanced is playing there Wizard wrong(some are,yes but not all of us) but what i am saying is that we have some draw backs that should be looked into and see if there is room for improvement in some ways that will only help us to get better,not God-like just better.<P>Please keep the ideas rolling and hopefully Absor will have the time to go through all of them because there are some well thought out ideas and opinions on what would help to make us a bit better.

</FONT><HR>I only have 1 complaint.  I am also being serious.  We need to have higher DD spells.  Plain and simple.  Verent dubed Wizards as Kings of DD but that is not true.  Mages out dmg us.  They have higher dmg nukes than us till 44 - 49.  Also they can cast a pet.  Not just 1 pet but have a choice of 4.  Wizards need be balenced.  Every freaken spell post 50 is around the same dmg.  What sense does that make?  The dmg should be increasing.  A wizard studies the arcane arts of magic.  They are supposed to feared for what they can do.  Mystrious in nature but in EQ we are the biggest walking sissys in the game.  You need to add more to the Wizard class.  More spells that cause more dmg.  Add something that is truely unique to the wizard class.  The wizard class seems to be a combine of many classes.  Enchanter, Mage and Druids.  There is nothing unique about us.  With all the new mobs out there now with high HPs you would think Verent would put out high dmg spells for wizards.  Since we are SUPPOSED to be the Kings of DD.  Dont even say we are balenced.  How can you call us balenced when Mages can out damage us in DD and have a pet they deals a massive amount of dmg in seconds.  Yeah, we're balenced alright.  <P>Oddy"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Belissa, I don't want to lower your hopes or morale, but you are right on the edge of the hardest level range of being a wizard.  From that point, things change a LOT, especially once you get into the level 44+ range.  What most of the experienced wizards have gone through is NOT a problem in the early to mid levels, but in the higher levels where things are supposed to become more balanced, but don't.<P>As I have posted before, the hit points the mobs have goes up on almost on a logarithmic scale.  A level 35 mob doesn't have a HUGE number of hit points compared to a level 34 mob, but a level 55 mob has over a thousand more hit points more than a level 54 mob in many situations, and in some cases, it's MUCH more.  Velious breaks the 32000 hit point limit that mobs in "old Norrath" and Kunark had.  And the damage output from these mobs is HUGE.<P>So, you never run out of mana at 35.  Yea, I remember those days, it would take a lot of effort to go OOM in a well balanced group.  Dreadlands, Karnor's Castle, Old Sebilis, Chardok.  These are much tougher places to hunt, even the lowest mobs in dreadlands have over 2000 hit points, and with constant pulling, even if you only nuke twice per mob, a pull of 3 or 4 mobs at a time will quickly take down your mana bar.  Conflagration at level 44, rend and ice comet at 49.  At the level you get them, they take a bit under a bubble of mana at the level you get them.  The mobs are tough enough where you need the damage output of your highest level nuke.  Sorry, 300 dam per nuke doesn't help much if you nuke twice per mob.  Seems nice in dreadlands, but in Karnor's?  Ok, so you are down to 1 nuke per mob in Karnor's, on mobs that have around 4000 hit points or more in most situations.  Level 44, 606 damage once, or 3 times a battle, one per mob.  As you can expect, mana goes away quickly, and it's not fun to "ok, here's my one nuke".<P>AoE is the only place we shine, but it's not often we can use it, unless we force the issue so others see how useful it is when there's no enchanter.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Okiisama you said "Add something that is truely unique to the wizard class"..they did its our gates/ports. Yes I know that Druids get them to but there the only other ones that have them so is a way we are very unique and to anyone out there that says "Well that's not enough" I can understand where your coming from compared to say an Enchanter with Clarity or a Cleric with rezzes but if you have played other classes(not including Druids) you know just how helpful our gates are, I have a Mage sitting over by City of Mist and when I have to leave and there isn't a Druid or Wizard I can ask for a port around I have one hell of a long LONG walk to make so I appreciate the gates more then ever and maybe more Wizards out there should too(as I'm sure some do).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This would be nice, but the one thing that would make our class be REQUIRED in Velious and the other areas would be an un-resistable root spell with a minimum 1 min duration.  This version WOULD break easily, but with a minimum hold time, with no chance to resist(even uber-mobs), this would let us act as crowd control in zones and areas no other class can.  Right now, if AoE Mezz doesn't work, that means we need to fight ALL mobs at the same time, many which do over 150 damage per hit dual attack.  This would make us useful, AND required, without needing huge nukes.  While I'd like the damage issue addressed, I'd settle for being NEEDED, in much the same way an enchanter and cleric are.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055066-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055066.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055066-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055066-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055066-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055066-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055066&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055066&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
