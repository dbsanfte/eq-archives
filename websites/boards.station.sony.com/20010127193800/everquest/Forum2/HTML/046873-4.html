&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>With all due respect I would have liked the following to be included about levels, classes and experience:<P>Levels 1-20.  Every class will be able to solo (i.e. kill blue mobs 1 on 1 given full health, mana, buffs, etc. at start of battle) given the equipment that coin loot can purchase from merchants.  This will become harder as you approach 20 and some higher blue mobs (ones nearer your level) may be too tough a challenge to some race/class combinations.<P>Levels 21-30.  With appropriate equipment warriors, rogues, and wizards will no longer effectively be able to solo.  Unless battling undead it will become difficult for clerics to solo.<P>Levels 31-40.  Hybrid classes, although still capable of soloing become markedly inefficient as they increase to level 40.  Beyond these levels <BR>a monks ability to solo is very small.<P>Levels 41-50.  Hybrid soloing becomes very situtational (i.e. posible against certain blue mobs in this zone, but not other blue mobs in this or other zones).  The only classes that are designed to solo at this level are druids, magicians, and necromancers.  Additional classes that can solo, but may require more selective hunting are Shaman, Enchanter, Bard, and Enchanter.<P>Levels 51-50.  A Ranger becomes a damage supporting melee class and are not intended to take hits beyond level 50.  Clerics become the most desired healers.  Druids and Shaman now enter there role as supporting healer and buffer/debuffer (Shaman) and nuker/evacer (Druid).<BR>At this level of play an Enchanter may become a necessary group member if one wishes to explore certain areas of some dungeon zones.  Paladins and Shadowknights are designed to supplement their damage dealing in groups by also taking damage (although a Warrior is preferred in this capacity) and by use of their spells.  Monks are a valuable addition as they inflict the second-highest amount of melee damage and posses some skills that can make hunting areas safer for them and their partner.  Rogues inflict the greatest amount of melee damage and provide useful reconaissance and recovery skills.  Bards, through the use of their many songs, enhance almosy any group situation.<BR>    <BR>Alan, this is what came out of my head with no planning or revisions.  Now, I *could* write a level 56-60 part to this summary, but I have one problem: how do I say with a straight face that "A Paladin gains buffs and heals nearly as good as a Cleric, including the highly sought-after spell Resurrection.  This makes a Paladin a tremendous asset to any group that does not have a Cleric."  I *could* do a white-wash of the problems that plagues all the classes that are not (clr/war/rog/ench/brd).  The BEST I could come up with (with a clear conscience) is the following:<P>Levels 55-60. These levels are primarily designed for muliple-group 'raids' and groups that contain the most 'balanced' mixture of classes.  At this level a group of 1 warrior, 2 rangers, 2 druids and a shadowknight will not be able to perform with nearly the efficiency of a group that consisted of a warrior, a rogue, an enchanter, a cleric,a bard, and a wizard for example.  This is by design in order for the game to remain a challenge for more balanced groups.  At these levels it is more useful to perform 1 task very well, then 3 tasks moderately well.  Warriors will 'tank' better than Shadowknights and Paladins.  Rogues will inflict more damage than Rangers or even Monks.  A Cleric will be a much more efficient healer than a Shaman or Druid.  These differences continue to increase until at level 60 there is a noticeable separation in the specialized classes ability to perform a function over the same task being performed by a more general class (i.e A Rogue being 'specialized' in inflicting melee damage will become better at this relative to the ability of a Ranger to do the same).  Groups may seek out members who can fill one particular role rather than a generalist who has more flexible (but less focused) abilities.  Solo classes may continue to solo.  But doing so at these levels is very risky.  Therefore these classes gain some abilities that make them useful to groups, although they will never be as useful (in general situations) as the classes that are designed to need groups to fight with.  <P>I VERY much would have liked to have seen such a piece of Info in the FAQ.  It is as optimistic about the 'end-game' levels as it can be.  If I had known the above I either A) would have selected a different class, or B) quit after my free month.<P>I honestly hope this has been helpful.<P>Sincerely,<P>Thaumiel<BR>E'ci </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>Seriously, put in the hard knows too. This board is too often populated with the same hard no posts because the hard nos are really only word of mouth. <P>The old faq really did much to alleviate that since it would use language like:<P>"no plans to impliment guild housing at this time"<P>At this late point in everquest, knowing that there are some limitations due to what the graphics limitations of a legacy original everquest might be in addition to it just being really too late in the lifecycle to massively change this game, here are some of my Hard No guesses which should be in the faq.<P>Horses: Hard no. There will never be horses in this game for all time. Besides changing the entire way that transportation would work, it would also be a problem due to current game limitations. <P>For example; horses could not zone. The fact that a horse, like a pet, like a cosmetic change such as wolf form, can't zone would make it of little use in the first place. <P>Second there is no real way in the old game engine to make on entity actually riding another. The player and the horse would have to more or less turn into one creature/texture making all say humans, or human paladins riding a horse look exactly the same.<P><BR>Guild housing: hard no. <P>I can't think up lots of reasons why housing is a no except the big one, that with 12,000 players signed on per server and 1200 on at the same time there would just not be the space even with every empty building in the game rented out.<BR>Its just pretty obvious at this late point that housing won't be in the game in any shape or form, so saying things like "we have no plans to put housing in at this time" is misleading.<P>Kind of like that, list the hard no's, then say exactly why they will never, ever, for all time happen in this game. I know there are some real hard no's and I guess that housing and horses are pretty much the big ones.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This thread is a bit too long to read all the way through, but I got half way though and I've compiled a list that most newbies asked me (or I would think they would ask). BTW, I have to agree that half of these questions would be solved if they read the manual. First thing I do is RTFM! In the days of UNIX if you didn't do that ... well you could do nothing actually. <P>Then again I guess that's why we IT support people are in business and making money. So please people, don't read the manuals it makes us money.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> Anyway a listing of the questions after reading the current FAQ and manual again:<P>Q: Now that 3dfx dropped glide support and the company has been acquired by NVIDIA what are your plans for the future of the glide API?<P>Q: Will there ever be 32-bit support for EQ?<P>Q: What are the effects of religion on GAMEPLAY (not Role-play) and how does choosing one deity over the other effect my choices?<P>Q: I recently purchased EverQuest: Ruins of Kunark and there is no cinematic. I was under the impression that there was an opening cinematic to this game.<P>Q: What is the faction system and how does it work?<P>Q: I've learned that some casters will have to research their spells at higher level. Please explain the basics of how this is done.<P>Q: I seem to have difficulty killing some NPCs. There is this NPC that gives a lot of quests (read quest NPC) and I want to kill him but can't, why? Also I want to slay merchants to get all the loot they carry, how can I do this?<P>Q: I was hunting one day when I got swarmed and ran to the guards. I learned there where no guards because they had been killed. What can I do to remedy this?<P>Q: Why do some monsters that consider green to me still attack and sometimes kill me, hitting for much more than I would expect a green to hit.<P>Q: Please explain why the rules that govern player casting do not apply to NPCs casting a spell (casting while running being a big example).<P>Q: If I give my pet two weapons will he wield both of them or only one? Is there a minimum level for them to wield two weapons? Is the delay on a weapon in effect if I give it over to my pet?<P>Q: Are there any advantages to being PvP (red) on a non-PvP server.<P>Q: What is "camping" and how does it work. I went to Crushbone and started hunting Orcs when someone told me to get off the hill because it was camped, please explain this.<P>Q: If I am "camping" a certain place does that mean I own it for that duration?<P>Q: Explain the color system for the names above the various characters in EverQuest.<P>Q: Is DirectX 8 supported (Lots of problems from this one).<P>Q: Do different types of food/drink last longer than others. I've heard drink is consumed faster in the desert, is this true?<P>Q: What does it mean to be encumbered?<BR>Q: Explain to me how the text skill level pertains to points (example: 81-90 = Very Good, 91-100 = Excellent, 101+ = Master).<P>Q: I recently was killing rats in Freeport when I came across a person that was just killing them and not looting. There were 20+ rat corpses on the ground and people where yelling at him, was he in the wrong or not?<P>Q: I hear people shouting out for a bind. What is this bind and how do I do it. Where are the locations I can bind?<P>Q: What are variables and how can I add them to my macros.<P>These are just some of the questions I came up with as I was reading through the manual/FAQ. Now mind you that some of these questions may be answered already but the reason I post them here is because the answers are either too vague or sadly they don’t read the manual.<P>I'm sure that a person who wants to know if the game has macro keys would like a little more than just yes, or no. A nice explanation of how it can be done (or at least an example) would be nice. <P>Also the fact remains that people don't read the manual and most don't even want to waste time on reading an FAQ. This is why I agree a table of contents would make it easier for that person trying to find the "quick" answer (as an FAQ, unlike a manual should be just that).<P>On one important note I LOVE the way Liandriana explained the Q&A of "twinking." It was non-offensive and really came across very well, something that a newbie would not be turned off or offended by.<P>On a last note: RTFM! Really folks it may seem boring to read the manual to a new product but if newbies would read manuals to games the issue of "newbies annoying veterans" would be reduced greatly. Also if some companies would learn to write more comprehensive manuals (not saying you Verant (this is a changing game therefore creating an exclusive manual would be difficult)). <P>There would be fewer questions and I almost promise you that the person that read the manual first would enjoy the game more (being they already have a better understanding of how it works). Anyway, just some ideas for the new FAQ that will hopefully be of some help.<P>Tramaus<BR>17th Paladin - Order of Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I dont think there should be any comments on what a "role" of  particular class should be at any given point.  I think that the masses of EQ have already become to "role" oriented as it is, and I doubt that VI would WANT to specify roles for classes, and I dont think that they should.  I know that my chars often play "out of the box" to what people expect from thier abilities, and much too often to the complete surprise of the group that say "man I had no idea you could do that, I just thought your class should do XYZ".  I dont think VI should get into the business of telling others how to play the game to be effective, as it is there are already too many close minded people to really play with the diversity of classes we have now.<P>If everyone plays with one tactic in mind then only a single type of group will be effective.  The key is to change the tactics to the groups and not the group to the tactics.  Anyway, this is just a response to all the "you should tell them what there roll would be post blah blah so they know they cant solo or group in these zones and what not posts".</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
