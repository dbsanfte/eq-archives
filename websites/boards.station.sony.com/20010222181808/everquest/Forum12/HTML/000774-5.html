</FONT><HR>I hate to say it but reading this only made me worried.<BR>Why is it that Enchanters are looking to be nerfed and cut into so bad? <P>I just don't understand it. <BR>You have NEVER gone after any class like this. Why don't you reduce CH to only heal up to 65% of the persons max health? That would have made druids and shamans seem like better healers. <P>Why dont you make everyone run a little faster so everyone doesn't have to get sow anymore? <BR>That would have made paladins and sks seem more usefull. <P>And the real truth of the matter is no one ever needs Enchanters. You can go to just about any outdoor zone and you will never need an Enchanters all you have to do is root park stuff. <P>The only place you need chanters is in dungeons. Thats how it has always been since Upper Guk Mistmoor and Cazic its always been that way, and that is how people like it. <P>I don't say this because I am an Enchanter either. Who wants to go into a dungeon and fight one spawn at a time, thats boring and there is no risk at all. You are absolutly going to take the fun out of the dungeons when you start making them all single or small spawns. Either that or the dungoens are going to be places only huge groups of people can go, otherwise they will be in utter fear of death. A perfect example of this is Velious all the high mr zones where chanters can't/don't want to go are empty or are just used by large guilds to stage raids or harvest items.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>If you are going to be spreading out croud control ability then givee us something to compensate. Like maybe fix a line of debuffs (the whole weaken line comes to mind) to actually do something. As it is, this line only reduces damage takem by my group by a very small degree. these spells just become agro builders. Besides, there is a huge croud control line out there. root/snare! how about making a minimum duration root to make it viable as a real croud control measure. It would still leave enchanters as the best cc, but give other classes the aility to do it if needed. Maybe add a mez-type spell that limits all attacks AND spell castings to point blank that is lost if attacked.<P>Unless a mob checks the value of the skin being used by a character to dertermine agro, then it shouldn't be a problem. <P>Also, ***? why do you want to take away illusions from enchanters? we have teh ability to LOOK like a skeleton, but necros have the ability to TRANSFORM into a skeleton. Make the differences clearer, don't just take away from a line of illusions which was supposed to be *pet* illusions.<P>enchanters die too much. could we have something plz? a better way to keep the monsters off of us? How a about a pet with 1 hp that looks like us, but dosn't move and assumes all of our agro? this would give us those crucial seconds needed for a second attempt at mez. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Most of my thoughts I already posted earlier on page three, but I was just reading through and I think that Bezze did a good job of summarizing the list.<P>I especially agree with him on:<BR>From the first list:<P>3a: A sow TYPE spell with wolfform or werewolf form.  Everyone thinks of it as SoW, but it would make sense that if an enchanter can increase someone's attack speed, they could increase their speed of movement, or at least self only.<P>4: Lull spells should work as well as harmony, whether they're single target or not.  ATM they are useless.<P>6b: IMO single target mezzes should overwrite AE mezzes, that way an enchanter could choose which creature/s they particularly do not want to break aggro.<P>11: I think this spell could be awesome for enchanters if it reoccurred, therefore eliminating or at least reducing a lot of our self aggro issues.<P>22: Not a big problem really, but can't cast the tashan line of spells sometimes after casting another spell because of a recast time bug.<P>Ok this is from his second list:<P>2:  Group rune, an idea I heard someone mention and suggested too, sounds great, would be kinda like an enchanter's version of evac.  People complain about dying a lot, this would help prevent unnecessary train deaths a lot, especially for casters with low hp.<P>3: Would definitely be very nice to be able to enchant group members' weapons with various spells / procs.<P>4: Give enchanters some benefits to choosing a particular religion, as it is theres no point to not choosing agnostic.<P>7b: Group illusion, one of the coolest ideas I've heard for the enchanter so far, VERY high priority IMO.<P>7d: Illusion monster would definitely be very cool, don't see why this wouldn't be feasable.<P>I also agree with what Jonny Mag said about a having a spell that casts C2, Gift of Brilliance, and Brilliance all in one, or have two versions, one lower level at level 44 or so that does clarity, insight, and gift of magic, and then the upgraded one that I mentioned before.<P>And my final argument, that I don't think I've heard anyone mention but I think would be really important in making enchanters use the illusions that they should be using, is give the illusions benefits!!  Give us a reason to use illusions, like troll regen and iksar swimming, but with abilities or stats that helped more (troll illusion is probably the only one worth using for functionality).<P>Anyway, just my thoughts, hope these are all considered.<P>Drakkarnoir<BR>Gnomechanter<BR>Druzzil-Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, I have two complaints.  I hope you read this absor, as it seems being seen is so rare on these boards. <P>First, while I understand that you say Enchanters have been given over to being "required" for most high level groups and therefor others need better ways to control crouds, I do not agree with your logic.  On the one hand, when we complain that we have little soloability, we are told universally by verant that we are not a solo calss, we are designed to group, and NEED a group, whereas others are designed to do both, more or less, depending on their class.  (IE necros being great at solo work, magicians being good, wizards being okay, etc..)  Now you are telling us that you want other's to be as useful in a group as we are for crowd control.  So, should I thank you now for making me obsolete?  A bard can already give clarity and haste.  At lower levels any class with root can effectively control small crowds by parking them.  Shamans can slow better, and debuff nearly as well.  Shamans can haste nearly as well.  My role has already become to just mez and/or be buff B***H.  Now you are telling me that this group only class (as Gordon liked to remind us on many occasions) will only be useful for buffs because you are gonna make bards able to mez more reliably?  Hrmmm, guess I will just start playimg a bard.  They live longer when their mez's break, and get much better items geared completely for them rather than items that are for any caster and basically offer you nothing within your prime req's.  <P>My second issue is the item imbalance.  Kunark armor is soooo much better than prekunark armor that planes raids to hate and fear have become mostly about the gods now.  With only people like me who end up having to buy their items with money earned from a trade (jewelry crafting) wanting to go because they are still wearing an oracle robe at 51st level.  Give us some more things that add benificial stats (ie not str or dex) or better resists, mana and hps.  Our defense cap hasn't raised in two expansions, and yet mobs offense rating has. Guess this is a third issue, but geez, I get hit for full almost every hit.  What's up absor?  Enchanters aren't really that much fun to play anymore, I enjoy my SK more now, she get's more groups.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ITEM: Some changes to religion's impact on the game are being considered.<P>OBSERVATION:  Regardless of the changes finally implemented, they would take effect after folks have already picked their strategy and have invested many hours in it.  This applies to all races and classes.<P>QUESTION:  Is it fair to possibly penalize some of these folks by changing the rules after they have made irrevocable choices?<P>SUGGESTION:  Create a one-time quest to change a character's religion.  This will allow folks to look at the new rules, and adjust their religion accordingly.  This would allow the designers to create a world where religion mattered, and allow established characters to pick the benefits and penalties afforded by the new order.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ITEM:  Illusion Religion<P>OPINION:  I am in favor of allowing enchanters to cast religious illusions.  Not a religious mask, but a specific religion, including agnostic.  <P>REASON:  This is in keeping with the basic concept of an enchanter.  To make people think you are something you are not.<P>I believe I understand the concept of limited resources, and that a sharp focus is needed here, or we will confuse the design team with an endless wish list.  I'd much rather have this line of spells than a DOT pet, wolf with SOW, the undead illusions, the lull series, or new graphics.  Please, please do not allocate your limited resources on things like new plate armor graphics for enchanters until more popular issues have been addressed.<P>Thank you for your time.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Reposting my ideas here in hopes that Absor reads it.<P>I'm going to go over a couple of things, one that I think is critical to note, and I'm not sure Alan read it before in my original post in the first thread... going to place it here in caps:<P>1) A LEVEL 55-56 ENCHANTER IS BETTER THAN A 57+ ENCHANTER VS. 56+ CREATURES.<P>Why is this? Not because the higher level enchanter can't mez more effectively with Glamour or Rapture, but because the 55-56 enchanter can use the system's /con command and determine if the thing they are about to mez requires Glamour of Kintaz vs. Dazzle. So, effectively, they waste less mana because the 57+ enchanter has to cast dazzle first, or just waste mana casting Kintaz on everything. <P>This is extremely evident in areas like the Mushrooms in Sebilis where only the highest level of the Mushrooms are 56, the rest are below. The 55-56 enchanter doesn't waste the mana on dazzle trying to mezmerize a 56 Mushroom, and doesn't get the possible agro associated with it making it more difficult to recast Glamour. Effectively making the 55-56 enchanter better. This is why spells should tell you beforehand whether or not they can be cast.<P>This is a VERY important argument toward why we should have a message stating "XXXX cannot be mesmerized with this spell" BEFORE casting.<P>2) ENCHANTERS NEED A MESMERIZE LINE FOR GIANTS/GIANT SIZED CREATURES<P>I know this has been mentioned, but what I'd like to see is something where we start to get a "giant" mesmerize starting at 34th. The 34th version is the same as the 4th level mesmerize for effect, but works on giants. Basically the line would be as follows:<P>Effect: Mesmerize vs. Large - 34th Level<BR>Effect: Enthrall vs. Large - 49th Level<BR>Effect: Entrance vs. Large - 54th level<BR>Effect: Dazzle vs. Large - 60th level<P>I think this is fair. It would NOT affect encounters like Vox and Nagafen simply because you've flagged those zones already such that anything 53+ in a non-kunark zone CANNOT be mezed, charmed or stunned. It would make us viable in giant situations and gives us the abilities at what I think are appropriate levels.<P>3) ILLUSIONS<P>I really could care less about losing undead illusions, although I really don't think they step into the realm of Necromancers. Why? Because we're able to cloud minds, to make you believe we are something we're not. If it happens to be a skeleton, so be it. If it happens to be a log, so be it.<P>What I'd like to see is MORE illusions. I like most of the suggestions, like Illusion: Gender, Illusion: Corpse and Illusion: Face. Gives us a lot of fun playing variety. I don't, however, think that we should get Spirit of the Wolf or like speed with our illusions.<P>4) BARDS SHOULD NOT BE NEARLY AS EFFECTIVE AS ENCHANTERS AT CROWD CONTROL!<P>This is a biggie that I saw Absor mention in his post, giving Bards more crowd control ability.  This will simply make the enchanter class utterly undersirable.  A bard will then not only be able to crowd control with little to no mana, they will be more effective at it because they can take the hits when their attempt fails whereas an enchanter cannot.  This is the primary function of an enchanter, it is the only reason to play the class, if you take crowd control away from us and pass it to others, making them nearly as effective, you will have a reversal effect on the Essential Enchanter... it will become the unnecessary enchanter.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Don't give bards better crowd control and here are my reasons. Everyone has there place in a group at this point. By adding more stuff like that you will kill enchanters in groups. Why take an enchanter for crowd control when you can have a bard with better ac to take the hits. The bard has more group spells on top of that. If you are going to give the bards the powers of an enchanter then why have enchanters at all. And don't you dare say illusions. I can only think a very very very very few occasions that they helped me do anything of value other than just for fun. To top that you give the bards some of the illusions via a mask. So what are we going to have that is enchanter ONLY for once. Hell I did not play for 54 levels to see my abilities, what draws me to a group be given to another class. If you feel that bards suck for some reason then give them something new but crowd control is a Enchanter thing. You will kill any chance of an enchanter getting groups in high level dungeons at that point. As if we don't stand around a lot now since a group only wants one enchanter but will take 2 bards. YOU say that you want to spread it out well you did necros have a limited form of mes now leave it alone we don't need a crowd control fix.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It was mentioned clearly in the first post to this topic as something which will not be looked at right now.  <P>That is an improved method of targetting NPCs when there are several of them.  This is one skill where having a slow computer makes it very much harder to do than with a fast computer.  Much of EQ is designed so its nearly as playable with the minimal computer as with the state of the art, and since this is perhaps the most important part of the game where there are still inequities, I think this should be looked at.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here's a powergamer's perspective:<P>1. Drop all the illusion rants. <P>2. Do something about masking religion.<P>3. Give us a stronger faction adjust spell at high high levels. Collaboration is practically useless vs. velious mobs.<P>4. Instead of giving us MORE limited usability spells that have insane recast times, think about giving us spells that are more useful if you're going to put those kind of restraints on it. Your new self rune line is a joke (from what I've seen of it). It has a recast so high that it eats ANOTHER one of my precious spell slots and 1k hp is barely more than Rune V. What's the point? Make it more like Jolt. That would save our asses... not a glorified rune V.<P>5. I don't know if there is a single class that has to swap spells as often as enchanters do. You give us SO many different spells with limited usability that I am constantly having to switch spells. You give us more spells that have to stay memmed because of their INSANE recast/cycle times... well you make it seem like you're trying to cripple us.<P>6. Make some of our buffs combine. Use Aegolism as an example. This could be done with the gift line, or a totally different spell at 60 and remove that gift spell.<P>7. Dictate needs reworking. Permanent on greens? Longer duration? Shorter recast/cycle? Dunno. You work it out. Just: Better!<P>8. Caster loot is almost non-existant. I've seen the ends of the world. Don't give me this crap about "not having been to the caster loot haven". PoG caster armor is a joke (stat wise it's barely an improvement and the effect spells are pathetic). The quested armor is barely better (5% improvement if that). EVERY uber mob encounter there is is GUARANTEED to have GREAT melee loot. Sleepers Tomb is the greatest insult to casters ever (yes it even beats early VP... I still have my robe of asphyxiation with no stats on it). In the meantime I'm finding that my gear is falling behind and I'm dying more often (so often that I have earned the nickname "walking corpse"). Melee are constantly getting fantastic improvements to their armor. They're getting effect spells that they DID NOT have as a class previously. Put some instant click mem blurs on our armor. You could have helped us out in point 5 by putting useful spells on our gear... but I'll bet it's hard to bother thinking about casters when dreaming up things like "Primal Velium". Resplendent trousers is an example of something that MIGHT have been useful (clarity after death yay!)... BUT you made it C1 with this insane cast time. I can cast C2 faster if I just sit and med the amount of time it would have taken to click the pants... Thx<P>9. I'm sure there's more, but why bother?<P>[60 Phantasmist] Lelaniel (High Elf) &lt;Fires of Heaven&gt;<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;” * lack of items to protect us better ( we are at the front line much more than any casters AC and HP are very important for us)”&lt;<P>Well, the reason it’s not listed is pretty simple. In order to give Enchanters enough armor class and hit points to survive the kind of situations that they get into, they’d have to have armor and hit points to match warriors. You all know that playing an enchanter is dangerous. Giving them more hit points and more armor wouldn’t change that, unless it was enough AC and HPs to make them truly out of balance.<P>ABSOR,<BR>If you are saying that ac and hp doent matter you are mistaken. Log parser programs have shown a signifigant reduction in damage taken over the course of time with increased ac.<P>If i wore regular caster gear I would die twice as much as I do now.<P>My level 56 enchanter fully buffed has 767ac. Most casters at my level are closer to 600. They are amazed at my ability to chgannel through a mez while being beat on. Its not my channeling skill that helps its the fact that the mob misses me on every other swing.<P>We dont need to be able to tank like warriors. Just to be able to do our jobs without dieing two and three times a night. Please throw us a bone and reccomend that either our defense cap be raised or that enchanter specific armour similiar to flayed skin is introduced. I have approximately twice the time played as compared to other people my level. That is a worse xp penalty than any Troll sk ever had.<P>We have ubertaunting spells, taunt doesnt work, mem blur doesnt work, unmezzable mobs and ultra high mr in veliuos.<P>The runeshield idea was a step in the right direction, just a poorly designed spell in our opinion.

</FONT><HR>Hmm I wondered if chanters would be really against  bards getting an improvement in their CC.<P>What they should really do is correct the stacking problems for bard/chanter mez.  This would allow a bard to help the chanter out in really messy pulls . Plus since we can take a hit (not many mind you) we may be able to take off some of the agro a chanter incurs when things go bad, but if you guys are happy getting killed all the time.......<P><BR>Also, remember when a bard is CC'ing they are usually doing only that...they are not hasting, slowing, singing clarity, regening health, or melee'ing, pretty limiting.  Please rememeber that bard songs have a max duration of less than any version of chanter mez, a good group with a chanter can control WAY more MOBS than any bard could ever hope to.  In most cases we can handle 3 MOBS, 4 is very difficult and the bard will be getting beat on.  <P>Most bards would welcome better CC (me included) but i dont think we have any intention or want to take away this role from the enchanter.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;1) An enchanter is considered ‘essential’ in a &gt;&gt;Kunark group <BR>&gt;&gt;2) A cleric is considered 'essential' in every &gt;&gt;group. <BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;Hence Druids and Shaman getting better healing &gt;spells post 50. <BR>&gt;<BR>&gt;- Alan <P>Shaman/Druids aren't healers.  A Shaman is a buffer/debuffer/Dot-er.  A druid is a buffer/DD-er.  Both of which can heal.  A cleric is a healer.<P>The only real problem you are having is in Velious melee is the only way to kill them.  Before players could construct all caster groups, now they can't (or can with difficulty).  Meaning "efficent" healers are necessary.  Druids and Shaman can heal indirectly using regen but these skills don't ramp up with the difficulty and damage dealing abilities of higher level NPC's.  And you are reluctant to upgrade these spells because of hp/mana conversion spells and the potential to give some classes near infinite mana without meditating.  FIND a way that allows for 50 hp regen a tick that makes sense rather then giving shaman cleric like healing abilities.  Same goes for druids.  For instance only allow regen to be cast on specific classes / long recast time / inhibit mana/hp conversion spells from working while on.  Something.  Between a druid/shaman I have no problem with one melee gaining 100hp a tick regen.  If you think that a dragon won't still kill the warrior for shame.<P><BR>Now back to enchanters.  My biggest beef is that illusions the staple enchanter ability are scoffed at post 50.  You have many issues which enchanters have mentioned which could benifit or be solved by illusions.<P>Why aren't you even considering illusions as a balancing factor?  Since this is a place for suggestions, I will suggest things.  All for consideration post 50.  I'm not changing the duration of any of the illusions (most are 36 min) and feel free to change them.  The goal is to cope with the numerous problems post 50 enchanters have such as low hp, low mana (due to high costs of new mes spells and their short durations), frequent resists.<P>Earth Elemental 2:  Cause we need hp<BR>+ 20 str (10 more then before) <BR>+ 1000 base hp.<BR>- minus 30 int<BR>- can't have a skin spell on yourself (like rune or augmentation)<BR>- 1 peridot per cast<P>Water Elemental 2: Cause we need mana<BR>+ Endure Breath (as before)<BR>+ 5 Mana Regen (a tick)<BR>+ 150 base mana (you can also have the other +mana spells in addition)<BR>- minus 2 hp a tick regen<P>Air Elemental 2: Cause we die alot<BR>+ Levitate (as before)<BR>+ % Chance to instant-gate when below 20% life (I was thinking 10% chance)<BR>+ % Chance to cast divine aura-like ability when below 20% life (I was thinking 75% chance).

</FONT><HR>Just a few thoughts on some of the issues presented here:<P>ITEM: DoT Pet.<P>LOL, our pet is basically already a glorified dot.  It's certainly not a tank, although it taunts better than anything except its owner for some reason.  This would hardly change the class in any earth-shattering way.<P><BR>ITEM: Illusion, Wolf.<P>There are already way too many useless illusions in the game.  If there are no advantages to using them why are they there at all?  The 25 SV Cold is nice on this one but it's useless in, say Vox's lair because it's indoors.  Something seriously needs to be done about this one.<P>ITEM: Undead Illusions.<P>DESCRIPTION: These transformations could be considered the territory of the necromancer, and <P>LOL again.  If anything undead illusions should do more.  As of now they're also useless.  They give no faction adjustments at all (despite Absor's statement that factions can't be turned off on illusions), skeleton does nothing at all stat-wise and the sv fire you get with drybone is, I believe, not as good as the sv fire you get with fire elemental.  I never understood the position that stated enchanters should have illusions taken away.  Someone asked a question that Absor responded to with a completely off-topic answer, so I'll ask again on the off chance he's still reading this: What do enchanters still have that is unique?  What spell, if given to another class, would you take away from them on the reasoning that it's the domain of the enchanter?  I can't think of any.<P>ITEM: Mesmerization spells and overwriting.<P>DESCRIPTION: Are single target mez spells <BR>...<BR>Someone suggested that not having these spells overwrite was intentional (according to GZ) to make playing enchanters more of a challenge. If <P>LOL yet again.  Encs are hard enough to play without having to memorize which spells (of the same type, mind you, and having the same effect on the target) overwrite which.  Although I could live with this if the icons weren't all the same.<P>ITEM: Pet Positioning.<P>See comments on Targetting, below.<P>ITEM: Mask Faith.<P>Please either add this or move spells and incandescent quest NPCs out of Neriak 3rd gate.  The SK guards there hate Quellious.  As to rewards for religion, if the new smithing stuff is all you can come up with, I'm not holding my breath.<P>ITEM: The Essential Enchanter.<P>Hmm, overlap is ok here but not with illusions that do NOTHING for us?  No offense Absor, but you're being inconsistent here.  As to the actual issue, someone made the excellent point that enchanters were made essential to groups for the simple reason that we're so completely useless on our own.  Sure, I can solo at 51 still, but necros and druids put me to shame.  Without a group, I often do faction quests and trade skills because it's all I can do.  Experience from the things I can solo is rapidly becoming not worth my time (keep in mind that an enc at my level can do maybe 5k damage on a full bar of mana with no resists, which limits our soloing options).  Not that I'm suggesting we should be soloing gods, I'm just saying without a group we are nothing, so maybe it's not so bad that we're wanted by groups.<P>ITEM: Boon of the Garou.<P>Either make this significantly longer duration (with proportional recast increase) or ditch the high recast.  As it stands it has to be recast every 6 minutes which basically gives it a permanent spell slot in a situation in which 8 slots has not been enough since about level 12 or so, which is another thing I have problems with, but that's a post for another day  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.  If it's going to be in a permanent spell slot I want it to be of use to more than 1 person at a time.<P>ITEM: Tash Line Aggro.<P>Did you know that with a snarer you can tash-kite more reliably than fear-kiting (since you control the direction the mob is running in) and for a lot less mana?  Something to think about.<P>ITEM: Global Mana Regen Idea.<P>Hmm, I can't help but think of this as a huge nerf.  I'm not sure it's at all warranted, given that necros already have lich and wizards have harvest and mages, well, they can just med during fights while their huge tank pets solo things can't they?  Also see comments on Essential Enchanter, above.<P>ITEM: Better pet control.<P>I don't know, I'm not sure I care on this one.  It's not like we don't end up tanking a significant number of fights anyway (and our pet attacks the things that hit us).  This would only be helpful in crowd-control situations, and frankly any enc who has a pet up where a crowd is a possibility is totally insane anyway.<P>ITEM: Enchanting Items.<P>I completely expected to be able to enchant items when I started my enc.  Not from the manual description but from my experience with MUDs of various flavors in all of which enchanting items was a central ability.  At this point I doubt any item enchantments we get would be that great, since the trade skills VI has altered recently don't really compare to the equipment you can get from drops at the level required.  I wish this had been in the game earlier but now it probably wouldn't be worth my time.<P>ITEM: Thicken Mana.<P>Lol, "more uses"?  How about one viable use?  I'd settle for that.<P>ITEM: Targeting.<P>DESCRIPTION: Enchanters in particular would like <BR>...<BR>would certainly make their lives easier. Though it should be kept in mind that it's not supposed to be too easy.<P>Again, I have to wonder how much "we don't feel like it" is mixed in with that "not supposed to be too easy".  Why not?  Is being able to target something in a stack of mobs in less than a minute really that big a deal?  You can't possibly tell me that the shortcomings of the UI are actually an intended part of the challenge of the game.  And I don't want to hear "it would be too hard" either.  <P>&lt;TECHNICAL&gt;<BR>Since you're already making a pixel-level entity list for purposes of visibility calculations, just cycle through that and target the next entity down when the player clicks on a pixel near the last one clicked on.  Don't make me come down there and do it myself  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>&lt;/TECHNICAL&gt;<P>That's all for now.

</FONT><HR>Let me clarify a few things for you foolish enchanters (thats not all of you, SOME of you)<BR>Bards cannot mezz giants.<BR>Before level 53, bards have to be super-human to mezz 3 mobs, assuming NO resists. And this means NO clarity, NO haste, NO slow.<BR>Bard snare is pathetic...slowdown is weak and it breaks RANDOMLY.<BR>Bard melee, is quite frankly, pitiful. Most hits will be 2x weapon's base damage plus a little bit if yer LUCKY. And everyone saying bards will tank like warriors...well what about rogues? Same AC armor, same defense cap as us...they do loooads of tanking. Oh yeah, our parry/riposte caps at 75. Fun.<BR>Hps - average bard vs average enchanter - without your buffs we will probably have a bit more. WITH your buffs you will probably have a bit more. You would be reeeally hard pressed to find a bard with above 70-80 base stamina. We are talking caster-ish HPs here, without the sheilding line to buff it up :P<BR>Bard haste doesn't stack with other hastes. Our best haste up to lvl 36 is 10%...yes 10%. The best we ever get is 45%...and thats at about lvl 54 or so. <P>So in almost all situations <BR>Enchanter &gt; bard <P>I wish I hadn't gotten so wound up reading this thread. I really want for you all to get more illusions....the business over the lack of graphics memory and the spectre pet was ridiculous. And I hope they give you back mezzing ability in Velious 50+ dungeons. But don't PLEASe don't use bards as a scapegoat.

Resurection not only gets you back lost exp, but it lets the group continue without a huge amount of downtime.  No matter how much better you make druid and shaman healing, a cleric will ALWAYS be essential in a dungeon for anything past the zoneline.<P>You just can't compare cleric healing to chanter mezzing.  The analogy is more like cleric healing to chanter speed/haste buffing.. at it's core, the mez line is an enchanters resurection.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>Absor wrote:<BR>"Simple. Because ?crowd control? is an area of gameplay the needs to be spread around to help groups in combat situations. Because there should never be a time when one class becomes ?essential? for anything more than a few situations. Bards having crowd control helps everyone looking to create a group."<P>I'm definitely not against bards being able to do crowd control or even getting their abilities increased.  The game needs skills to be spread around for all players to have a fun experience.  I'm concerned, however, that this improvement for bards will go too far.  The whines on these boards are mostly repeated thoughts that people have not verified themselves.  People believe that an enchanter is "required" to do high level dungeons.  People believe that bard crowd control is broken at this time.  People believe this and thus do not adventure on their own and try things without an enchanter.  These people read all the spoilers, follow tested strategies, etc.  In my experience, admittingly with very good bards, a bard can currently do a very good job of crowd control.  Depsite having my level 60 enchanter and level 57 rogue on separate accounts and having the ability to play both well at the same time, I never have a second thought about just playing the rogue and going deep in Sebelis with just a bard.  I've yet to have a wipe out with a bard, even with a 5 frog pull or the room we're in repopping.  Bards are very good at crowd control.  I've even witnessed bards mez mobs in Velkator's and Siren's Grotto that I could not get my mez spells to stick on (including the level 59 rapture).<P>Part of the balance for enchanters being great at crowd control is their fragility.  We can not take much of a beating.  Second, we have the worst offensive power of any class (except for high risk charming).  If you make Bards equal to enchanters in crowd control, they do not pay the same penelty in HP/AC/Defensive skills as an enchanter does.  They're not a warrior, but they can take much more of a beating than a robe wearing enchanter.  With equal mezing ability, a bard would be a preferred crowd controller in that they can take the beating.  Secondly, they never run out of mana doing crowd control.  When things get ugly, they can just keep going.  Enchanters will be completely out-classed at their one roll during a battle.  Also, bards might not have double attack, making them a weak mele class, but they do have the ability to mele.  This mele is not dependant on mana (nukes/dots) nor is it dependant on the resists of a mob.  So not only does the bard not pay the price of wearing a robe, but they also have significantly more offensive power than an enchanter.  You need to ensure that enchanters maintain a noticable edge in an average encounter so that the price they pay for their power does not make them a second choice.  Clerics are keeping the unique ability of healers to complete heal and experience ressurect.  Please ensure enchanters maintain a unique ability of crowd control.<P>Lastly, you might add in that enchanters get buffs in addition to their crowd control abilities.  This weekend I parsed my damage with my rogue using just buffs from a level 60 enchanter and grouped with a 59 bard.  Over about a 3 hour period, I did about 5 damage/second (12%) more grouped with the bard than I did with enchanter buffs.   This included the bard taking time off from buff songs to do crowd control.<P>I do not believe the issue is that bards do not have the abilities, but I believe the issue is player perception.  Bards are an odd class;  it's going to be tough to balance them.  Making them a plate-wearing, meleing enchanter will just make the enchanter class worthless.  That's not balance.  <P>Qucay<BR>60th Enchanter/57th Rogue<BR>Mith Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, <P>I've skimmed over things, but haven't read all posts but am still contributing my input. <P>You mentioned making clarity less of a necessity.  This really bothers me.  Many groups hunt outside for many levels.  They can single pull and the only reason enchanters are in the group are for clarity.  Yes, we can do things like slow, stun, etc, but other classes are admitedly better at this.  If clarity is not needed, then the enchanter is not needed in outside groups.  As it is, people often prefer a bard because a bard can do more damage.  This relegates us to dungeons.  I love dungeons, but I don't want to spend all my time there because it gets tiresome.  If you want proof, look how many enchanters have trouble getting in groups in outside areas before they get breeze or right before they get clarity.  <P>Second, you mentioned lessening enchanters being considered group "essential".  Clerics are and will always be prefered over druids and shamans and it will have nothing to do with their ability to heal so much as it does with their ability to rez.  Rez is one thing that makes clerics VERY class defined.  Enchanters are defined by their ability to crowd control and mana regen.  Mana regen was covered in my first response, let me respond here with crowd control.  Enchanters are considered essential in Kunark dungeons (not most outdoor situations).  Why?  Because we are the best at crowd control.  This is OUR class defining ability.  We are essential because we are best, we know how to do it, we train on how to do it from the very low levels.  Other classes such as bards have many other tasks and therefore dont really specialize in any one thing.  Improving someones ability to crowd control is toning down our uniqueness a bit.  Bards can already charm better (because when charm fails they can actually soak the hits), and they can mez to an extent.  Don't give away something that makes us desirable to groups.  If we have no mana regen and people can crowd control as well as we can, then we're in trouble.  If other classes can do everything we can with most likely less resists, then we are no longer wanted.  We have a pet we can't control and we have to take hits for him to do anything, we can't nuke well because of the double resist checks, Our dots are pathetic and the debuffing doesn't affect the monsters because it goes on a PC's skill rather than on the Mobs infinite level of strength ect, we uber taunt with our spells thus a cleric has to at times focus on keeping us healed rather than the tank, we have to be in hitting range to really stun, our slows can be done better by someone else, our hastes don't matter much with many tanks with haste equipment and bard haste songs, bards can regen mana like we can, our illusions certainly don't help the group, if you buff someone elses ability to crowd control, you put us out of business.  <P>Please don't do this to the class I love.  We're already limited in our abilities by the fact that all our spells are magic based and the fact that we can't mez certain things.  <BR>If these two things are done to my class, I will seriously be considering retiring my enchanter.  My group uniqueness will be gone and thus I will be less desired in groups and groups are what makes the game fun.  <BR>Sincerely<BR>Obzidian <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>first of all, I'd like to state that I somewhat agree with the dot pet (assuming it actually does damage and doesnt die after 5 seconds from a riposte). The reason is this: after a certain point the only way to do damage (especially velious) is via melee. I can nuke for 675 damage with a 6 second casting time, huge recast and a rogue can backstab for 900. Something is wrong here, I'm using a finite ressource (mana) and I get severly outdamaged by a meleer who can evade (while mem blur, one of my specialities, doesnt work). A better solution to the problem would be to fix casting damage for all casters to at least match melee in effectiveness in some if not all situations.<P>Tash line aggro: while some people like it (I personally do not at all) make it worth the aggro its getting if you dont want to reduce it. (for the amount of aggro it should lower a mob's mr close to 0). A more realistic solution would be to up the debuff while lowering the aggro.<P>Gift of brilliance, for god's sake dont touch it. I wont state what the use of this spell can be because I dont want it nerfed, but trust me, its useful.<P>I still dont like the post 50 meses who cost insane amounts of mana and dont last long. While its very clear this is an inderect nerf to our mesing, why not use these spells or use the no mes flag, not both. If you plan to use the no mes flag how about giving us an upgrade to dazzle in terms of duration. <P>The level 60 charm, unlike the other charms, is capped less then the level you get it. This spell should be reviewed as well in terms of how long the recast is and how long it last. Unresistable and stable is nice, but the drawbacks for it are a bit severe.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
