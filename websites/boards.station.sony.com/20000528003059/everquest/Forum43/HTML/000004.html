</FONT><HR>We will be starting a new Guild at the break in March. This will be a Bard's only Guild that may or may not expand to add Rogues to it.<P>The name to be used will be "The Strings of Ayre", and there will be a corresponding web site for it. We will be needing, I presume some "Bard Hierophantus" for each Server, or equivalent, and this person will be in charge of said rules for Bards ... something like that.<P>The main requirement for induction, is that a Bard has to get "caught" delivering a poem, or song in some location way up high in this game. A snapshot would be cool at that point, and may become the proof required. The location of this delivery should remain rather quiet and "secret" so that other newbies can also go use their own talents and discovery abilities to display their desire to expand this game and Guild into areas that have never been reached before.<P>So, if you hear someone read a poem, or singing a song, and have no idea where that is coming from ... rejoice, it ia a Bard doing what it does best.<P>Moshkiae</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>As a member of Dragonriders of Norrath, I can tell you that we have a group of core players that are on pretty much every day, but we are not a "power" guild.  We are a good guild, (no evil members), whose tenets include helping the weak and NO kill stealing.  I think we might be a bit weak on the role-playing side, but we do have a lot of fun regardless.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Contact Tbor (guild leader) or Planetslayer (officer) about joining.  Another good group I have encountered is Emerald Phoenix.  I don't know their tenets, but the people I've met are good people.  My suggestion to any one interested in joining a guild would be to keep an eye out during your travels and speak to guildmembers.  See what kind of people they are, spend some time in a group with them before deciding if that particular guild is right for you.  Good hunting!<BR>Circadian, (I just made 14th!)

We are brand spanking new, but are sure to grow quickly with quality members. Our guild is built upon the foundations of travelling, questing, exploring, and roleplaying. We aren't so much about powerleveling, and definately not twinking. We only accept good-hearted fun-loving people. And we choose from all races, classes, and creeds. <BR>Visit the friendly Luclin server and type "/who all Shades" and you will get a list of members online at the time. Drop one of us a line or find me, Jolos, officer of Shades of YesterYear, to have a friendly chat.

</FONT><HR>This is a post by someone very dear to me:Hail and well met friend! I am a native of the Bristlebane server, but after much time there I have contemplated coming to Luclin for many of the same reasons so many others have posted here doing the same from Prexus. On Bristlebane there is a guild known as "The Claw of Nagafen" which is devoted to the simple goal of including people who are the best group players they can be. Numerous run-ins with clerics who don't heal, tanks who don't taunt, or just plain rude or greedy people naturally led me to look into this guild. Alas it was old by the time I found it, most of it's members were at least lvl 30 or higher. *sigh* It has been my hope to bring those same ideals and beliefs to the Luclin server, and to create a society of people who are &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; players, so that we may all have friends to count on and talented partners to group with. If this is something that interests you please leave a reply here or email me at vader3001@hotmail.com, if there are enough people we can get it going, if not so be it.<BR>Peace, and smack that Hill Giant once for me!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Veteran's Legion Guild, LuclinVeteran's Legion Charter <BR>contact: vader3001@hotmail.com to join<P>We, the members of the Veteran's Legion, have banded together for a common goal.  This goal is to become, both as individual players of Everquest, and as communal groupers, the best and most talented players we each can be.  Everyone has had experiences in groups when they went "Man, &lt;insert name&gt; is not very good, he's hurting this group…"  and also times when they went "Wow, &lt;insert name&gt; really knows his stuff, he's really helping the group!"  The point of the Veteran's Legion is to gather all of these latter players together, so that we all will have a pool of talented players from which to group, seek or provide help, and call friend. <P><BR>Some Specific Tenents of the Veteran's Legion <P>-Do Not KillSteal!  At least not on purpose!  If you are purposely taking someone else's kill when you know you don't deserve and didn't earn it, you are ks'ing, and it is a bad player trait.  As our entire purpose is to develop good players, this obviously goes against the grain.  As in every 'Do Not' idea, you aren't going to be ousted after X incidences, but each time you do this or any of the other negative actions it stains your character, at least a little bit, and continual occurrences will have their expected effect. <P>-Help each other, and others.  You normally treat people in Everquest you don't know just like you treat strangers in real life- you might help them if you feel generous at the time, but if you are in a hurry you might easily overlook them.  You normally treat people you are grouping with who you kinda know like you treat your real life friends, defending and supporting them against other monsters and players, and are more inclined to help them get an item or reach some other goal than you would some random person who asked you.  It seems natural then that you will treat people in your guild, a permanent group, as you treat your family in real life.  Sometimes we are just not able to help one of the others for whatever reason, but if it is at all possible for you to do so without seriously hindering yourself, by all means do so!  When dealing with your guildmates, it is expected that you will cast (sow, bind, etc) on them if they ask if it is reasonable to do so.  You should be prepared to use any trade skills you know to help them out for the cost of the materials if you can.  Be on the lookout for items you know others would like, if you see someone selling one grab it and sell it to your guildmate with no markup.  These things are relatively intuitive really. J  Take time every once in awhile to help out other people, and always keep an open mind when they need you…if someone needs another plat for a new spell, or needs an escort into a dungeon for corpse retrieval, or needs a sow, or clarity, or bind, help them out! <P>-Strive to be a talented player.  Not all of us are the most talented players right now, but we all share a common belief in its importance.  Learn from others who are more experienced than you, and always take the opportunity to share your knowledge with those less learned than yourself.  If you are in a group with some non-guild members, do what you can to put on your best show, so that at the end of the night they are all thinking you really knew your stuff!  Set an example among Norrath.  Try to always be mature, logical, calm.  Don't use Dewdspeak excessively, work through disagreements with others through conversation, not /ignore.  Someday we would like people to see our guildtag and immediately think "Oh, that's that guild of really good players!"  We want people to seek us out when they need a really good group for a hard hunt.  This continuing climb to excellence is the primary goal of the guild as a whole. <P>-Take an active part in the guild. Take time to group, or just chat, with your guildmates, make an effort to know as many as possible. If you are grouping, see if anyone in the guild has a suitable group for you, or give others the chance to join yours. To do this well means staying out of anon mode most of the time. Sometimes it is just better to go anon, people who can cast SOW, Bind, or Clarity are quickly bombarded by requests in populated zones. If you must go anon for a time, use /roleplay instead. This keeps your guildtag up so others can at least see your affiliation. I would urge everyone to use /roleplay if necessary, but to stay in normal mode most of the time, it is much easier to find a group among other things if you can see where and what level the guild members currently are. When you are not in-game, make an effort to communicate with others, or at least the guild leader, so everyone stays on the same page. Write and respond to emails, spend time at the guild website (Forthcoming) and message board (http://disc.server.com/Indices/106982.html), find a role you can play in the guild other than just being a player. (i.e. webmaster, photographer, recruiter, designer, treasurer, etc etc etc) <P><BR>Positioning in the Veteran's Legion <P>In terms of in-game, there are four levels of position.  The first two are voluntary, you place yourself where you feel you best fit, the second two are special, requiring extra effort and conducive circumstances to attain, where do you fit in the guild? <P>--Active Learner-  Not all of us are already superstar players, some are relatively new to Everquest.  Everyone recognizes the need for good players and groups, however, or they wouldn't be here.  This level of the guild is for people who want to know more, who are willing to learn.  By acknowledging themselves of this level they are expected to be attempting to better themselves, learning from others who might have more experiences.  They are also letting us all know beforehand that they have no illusions of grandeur, that they can and do mess up once in awhile.  There is no shame or lack of honor in this position, it simply allows those who don't want to feel the pressure to be a great player right out of the gate time to learn more and develop their skill <P>--Standing Member- These are your "normal" members, people who know their stuff pretty well, and are willing and able to help any Active Learner get better.  Everyone does make mistakes from time to time, but it is generally assumed that Standing Members will be people you can count on to make the right move even in the worst and most panicked situation. <P>--Officer- A guild has to have at least a few officers, we will likely be getting a few out of our initial charter group before too long.  Being an officer is a special privilege and responsibility, as an officer you are really expected to know what you are doing.  Officers can also invite new members, so to be an officer you have to show that you are able to judge potential members from everyone else, to help the guild grow while still maintaining quality.  If you are a Standing Member and would like to become and Officer, you can do a few things.  First, get in contact with the guild leader, the only person who can make new officers, and express your interest, tell why you want to be an Officer.  There obviously are not going to be that many officers, more as we grow, not everyone who wants to be and is talented enough can be one, we just aren't large enough yet.  The best thing to do is to prove yourself, day in and day out.  Show that you know your stuff every chance you get, group with other members, and other officers, get them behind you.  If we have a space for a new officer, and every Standing Member and a few current Officers say you're the man, you have a really good chance, right?  Officers are expected to be leaders among the guild, the guild leader cannot be everywhere at once.  If a large portion of the guild is around Freeport with one Officer while another section is in Faydark with the other Officers and the guild leader, the Officer in Freeport is expected to be a sort of ad hoc guild leader, supporting, helping, and taking charge if the members there need him to.  There are two specific ways to become an Officer.  The first is the gift basis- if a few current Officer's or the Guild Leader particularly notice your skill and efforts, dedication to the guild day in and day out, you may find yourself offered the promotion to Officer!  On the other hand, if you desire the promotion, let the Guild Leader and other Officers know, and then strive to maintain your highest level of play whenever you are on.  As was mentioned before, not everyone who wants to can be Officers, but these are the best ways of insuring that wen a space is open your name comes to mind. <P>--Guild Leader- The Guild Leader is quite simply the person who founded the guild.  As such he has many special rights, such as the ability to create officers, govern the members if necessary, and call guild wars.  To balance these out he also has more responsibility.  It is expected that the guild leader is very experienced with Everquest in general, of course few players are experts on every level range of every class and in every zone.  If the Guild Leader comes upon one of these sections he isn't as well versed in, he is expected to really take time to learn it, and to know of others to rely on until that time.  The Guild Leader, for all intents and purposes, is another officer in most cases.  As creator of the Veteran's Legion, Kulwen is the current Guild Leader.  He has gathered us all together, for all of our benefit.  If at some time in the future Kulwen is unable to perform his duties as Guild Leader, or finds that someone else in the guild is just much better suited for the role, he may pass the mantle to them.  See, if you work hard and deserve and earn it, any member may one day become Guild Leader!  This promotion is entirely on a gift basis, saying "I want to be Guild Leader" will not get you anywhere, you just have to earn it quietly over time.  The Guild Leader is not a dictator, but also not exactly a democratic president.  Members need to trust that he is acting in their best interests, but at the same time if nine out of ten members suggest something there's probably some basis behind it.  Mob Rule is not the ideal, but if you really want to have a guild war with some other guild, or to have a raid on Crushbone, or to recruit &lt;insert name&gt; into our fold, or any other thing you may want accomplished, the best way to make it so is to let the rest of us know through in-game methods, email, and the message board, and get as many people behind the idea as possible. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>HEALING NIFE GUILD: This is a brand new guild dedicated to good and helping others. Membership is small at this stage, maybe ten or so when fully initiated but will grow rapidly. The Guild Master is Sturmson, a Paladin of some repute! We revere Rodcet Nife and Mithaniel Marr in particular, but allow those serving other good deities to join (Shaydaran for example serves Tunare). Track down Sturmson ask to join, see you there!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum43&number=43&thisthread=000004&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum43&number=43&thisthread=000004&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
