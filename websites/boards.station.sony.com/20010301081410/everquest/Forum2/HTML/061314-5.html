</FONT><HR>"I can't argue with that. I can only tell you that when I bought EverQuest I wanted a changing world, an evolving game. I know plenty of people who wanted the same thing. And I can't see the difference between fighting a new NPC that acts differently and fighting an old NPC act differently."<P> Evolving? haha.<P> Well that's a real spin doctor kind of cop-out, since the changes that from a players viewpoint one would expect is <P> a) new zones that are doable by small groups of friends rather than your sanctioned ubay guilds. What zones have been added that weren't uber expansions?  Tell me a group of six can take on a mob of 80,000 hitpoints, I love the humor. You've added no new content or changed existing content to the old world in 3 years, except for one zone which is a quest kmart and another which is an uber raid zone, inaccessable to many players due to your faction booby traps.<P> b) to be something other than the persistence illustrated by the paladin soulfire.  Oh yeah, that changes... In an epic quest as this, the "hero" (oh, sorry, is that a dirty word to you guys?), lives as outlaw until he brings justice or rights the wrongs of the epic struggle.  After that, there is denoument, and the "hero" is a true hero to the people he has helped.  (Is the 4000 year old epic saga too much for you to comprehend?  oh, sorry...)<BR> Well, any "hero" that goes along with this quest and succeeds in killing Sir Lucan is STILL KOS afterwards, and permanently so due to the massive resulting faction hit.  Lucan comes right back 6 hours later, and everyone stupid enough to participate in an Epic Struggle can expect nothing in return except headaches for as long as they play that char.  <BR> I imagine that Ivanhoe would turn out differently if you were to right it.  Too bad Scott did not have your genius ;P <P>c) a Discoverable story line.  I won't bother with that one, it would take to long to enumerate examples for a spin doctor.  Its absurd to assert that the small amount of data you provide makes for an interesting back story.  I don't want to have to read a web page to learn about it either. <P>d) when negative changes occur, the impact is actually looked at from lvl 1 to lvl 60, from pickup groups of 2 players to raids of 60.  A small group fighting 2 monsters have enough troubles.  These rules make it impossible to maintain a buffer.  You want to make it impossible for a small group to survive.  In short, you cater to uber guilds (nothing new there).<P> e) as for the accusation that clerics have not tried the new system, well, neither has the live team or the play tester that you occaisionally use, so what of it?<P> If an evolving world means whack a mole with a change every now and then to make life harder for non 24/7 lifestyle players that were having (gasp) too much fun, I would really hate to see your idea of stagnation. <P> It is especially noted that the idea of making life easier on casual and non-uberguild players with things like <P>a) pathing changes in dungeons to make them less of death traps for normal groups.<BR>b) more bind points for non casters. <P> are notoriously absent from test or commentary. Its only, "Players are too good at crowd control, lets make a single spell mean instant death.  yeah, yeah, that's it..." that you consider changes to make up for "an evolving world"  <P> nice try. <P> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>No change to the below level 51 game!? Ha!<P>Here was the group:<P>Cleric 42<BR>Ranger 40<BR>Ranger 4?  (Don't remeber but lower than 48) <BR>Monk   44<BR>Pally  48<BR>Rogue  37<P>I was observing/saving the clerics butt with my level 49 cleric.  We were fighting in the minotaur elder room in L Guk.  According to the patch message this was all 51- play and we should not have noticed a difference.<P>CH hate! Ha, the cleric could pull mobs that were over half dead away from the 5 melees when he hadn't done a thing but sitt on his butt until then using sup heal, even GREATER heal .  Watching the fight, 42 cleric stands up and cast Sup Heal on the 48 pally.  And the all mobs including the one that the melees had killed to less than half health all run over to the cleric.<P>I hear by raise my right hand and afferm that I saw the following happen:<BR>Pally was away leading someone down to the room.  This leaves the Monk, Rogue, Cleric and 2 Rangers.  Again my level 49 cleric was observing/saving the 42 clerics butt with celestial heals.  The monk pulled 2 minos and a frog knight.  The melees are all attacking one of the minos.  And the other 2 mobs are attacking the monk.  The cleric stands up and casts Sup Heal on the Monk.  All 3 mobs including the mino that was OVER HALF DEAD run over and start stomping the stuffing out of the 42 cleric.  Meanwhile the melees run over and finish of the over half dead mino, switch to the haven't even been touched yet mino and kill it.  Then switch to the frog and kill it.  The WHOLE TIME the mobs never turned off the cleric that only cast ONE sup heal.  The WHOLE TIME the cleric was trying to heal him self, of course he didn't have a chance to get a spell off.  My level 49 cleric keep him alive with nice low taunt Celestial Heal.  After this the poor level 42 (doesn't have celestial heal yet) cleric decided to go back to greater healing to avoid certain death.  He still managed to pull plenty of mobs apon himself using greater healing, a level 24 spell in level 40+ fighting.<P>Sounds unbelievable doesn't it!  Well it is true!  I saw it myself.  All these post I read above are about Karnors and Sebilis, with one being in Dalnirs.  Well here is L Guk with level 40s PCs and this seems to be the worst tale yet.  Did Verant mess up the code and make it worse for below 51 instead of above 51???<P>A few months ago when I was level 40, the same pally in this group was level 40 we grouped up with a level 38 rogue and did this room using lots of rooting for croud control.  We got awsome exp, and never really came close to deing.  The healing hate list change is a HUGE NERF!  I have tried it and seen the extent of the NERF with my own EYES!!<P>What a load of horse patooy (no filting needed in my post!) Verant has been trying to feed us!<P>I have just come up with a fool proof way to kill any uber mob or derail any certain train of death.<P>Have 2 clerics ping pong healing each other.  Gather up about 25 rangers and rogues, doesn't matter they will never get hit.  have a chanter or 2 to cast the occasional rune on the clerics just incase.  The clerics will heal each other doing massive AE taunt keeping all the mobs on themselves while the melees kill them all one by one.<P>Thanks for the new uber fight stratigy.  Should make those pesky Velious encounters much easier now!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think the change was to try and help make it clear that CH was not intended to be a combat heal. It was to be a downtime heal. Unfortunatly they based Velious around CH being a combat used heal and now we see the problems.<BR>They should keep the new changes and look at the difficulty of some of the tougher creatures to be tuned more in line with either:<P>1. Not using CH in combat<P>or<P>2. Not being able to kill a cleric before there is ANY chance of taunting off them.<P>Instead of flaming Verant about this you could all have been more calm about it. If you don't like it then don't play, don't just threaten to cancel your accounts actually do it.<P>Also on the subject of testing, I can't beleive you would expact them(Verant) to be able to test everything before implementation. If they did that you would rarely see any changes. Its bad enough that the game is not dynamic at all without there being no gameplay changes.<P>Someone said it was only the 'Ubers' that want to see these changes but I know you are wrong. The people who don't want to see changes are those after an easy ride and not able to adapt to changes. If you want an easy(also same every time you play) multiplayer online game go play diablo 1 or 2.<P>I agree with the fact that Verant should try to make the changes 'feel' better with roleplay style comments.<P>Although I don't agree with the changes made to hate and CH(considering Velious) I do see why it was done and I will now watch to see what Verant will do. I guess first they need to discuss what the 'Vision' was for CH when they created it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have actually played with these changes and I have found that there is no difference from before than there is now.  I have been on 2 raids since the last patch and in the "pull" group on one of them and have had to use Ch several times while fighting mobs that were lvl 51 plus.  I agree that there may be a problem with fighting the "uber" mobs that do require different tactics.  I also admit that I am not currently in a guild that does very many of these encounters, nor will I most likely ever be.  Therefore, for me these changes are just like any other changes that VI makes. I adapt and change and I understand you lvl 58-60 maybe having even more of a problem but there is no use whining about it in the extreme... The only thing I can definately say is that if complaints about certian "specific" encounters continue they should be evaluated and maybe the mobs should be ajusted to help with this new agro change. As a cleric that will never probably participate in one of those encounters, I have no problem with this change and if it creates some more agro then I will adapt or die.<P>Kathara Lytefoot<BR>Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I dont know what they intended with this patch but it is broken in several ways.<P>Something weird is up with the agro from healing.<P>Last night we were working outside the Giant fort in Frontier Mountains.  our SK was pulling singles and our group consisted of 2 clerics, a mage, monk, SK, and druid.  There was some down time while everyone was medding and three groups near us had 5 giants going so our puller was waiting.  The whole world seemed cluttered with giants.  One of my guild mates in another group shouted for help and I ran over to see what was up.  He was in a team of 2 and His cleric was getting pounded and couldnt get a heal off and he was trying to taunt off her.  I root the giant drop a Greater Heal on her to by them some time and a Greater on him since he is getting hit the giant and trying to agro it.  I got no agro at this time, of course not in range to get hit and it rooted so no prob.  Another guildmate a warrior is holding his own with two giants and I throw a bravery and guard that way to give him 115 hp and some ac.  The third nearby group was a couple of Iksar with 2 giants they were working.  They were in good health and had 1 giant nearly dead.  I go over to my group and med back up.  When the rooted giant broke they had enough agro to kite him about and finish him.  They then came back and helped the warrior finish his.  The iksars dropped one of theirs and pulled further back with the other.  So far nothing out of the ordinary.  So all giants I interfered with or should have generated hate with were down and I got faction messages on them.  About 10 to 15 minutes later we are ready to disband for the night I leave group and I get hit by a Tump out of nowhere.  He then chases me half way to the zone and then wanders off and stands still by the burynai caves and here comes a Brae running over the hill straight towards me.  I move and it turns towards me.  I am thinking hmm what did I do to irritate him while running to zone.<P>Could have just been an agro bug.  Could be the iksar didnt finish their second one and it got agro passed to it by the ones fighting nearby.  It was just funny seeing this Giant top the hill headed to me and not knowing what I did.<P>On to other bugs in the patch.  I logged in and found someone looking for a healer.  I head that way and arrive just following a TPW.  They try to invite but it is bugged and I do not get the follow button.  they camp and return to no effect.  I was group bugged and had not even been in a group yet.<P>Oh well.<P>I am upset at verant for the continual nerfs of clerics and complete disreguard for clerical issues.  It is as if they refuse to even look at or listen to why clerics feel so limited.  Then they go and create a nerf to make our lives more miserable.  It isnt this nerf per se that hurts but the nerf, "your balanced", nerf, "your balanced it was a bug", nerf, "your balanced but it needed to be nerfed since it was overpowering", nerf...hypocrisy.<P>That and the Trolls that want to tell us we just need to learn to play our class.<P>Tfodthog Tmfof<BR>frustrated Cleric</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hrmms,<P>Funny to read that Absor uses rogues as an example stating that we have accepted the change.<P>I don't know what you've been reading but i know at least 20 rogues that have cancelled there account because of that change, and more are thinking of doing the same. I've seen raid where they took 5 rogue with them down to two because rogues are not worth it anymore. Hell look at me last night helping friend do his EPIC. I was only rogue in three groups, and 8 TANKS could not taunt the single mob off me. Even after i've evaded all my attaks, stopped attacking, backed away. Sorry, but the evade fix is no way a fix it as caused more screwed up then anything else. More and more rogues started to complain about this, so do not use Rogues as an exemple we have not yet posted about our problem with this fix here in masses, some think it works better. Yes it does in very specific circumstances (where you have more then one rogue). But generally when there's only one rogue present it doesn't. I've practically stopped using evade as there's no use i can't taunt the mob off me for the life of me. I've died 4 times in the last 2 days because of this where i had died 4 times in 20 days before.<P>Sorry to say, but your evade fix just screwed us more then anything else we just taking time to look at it more completly (Oh and did i forget to say, why i died so much well simply because clerics would not take the chance to CH and where using Superior Heal instead).<P>Regards,</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan, Here's the problem with the hate/heal patch and high end mob encounters in general.<P><BR>The changes to cleric hate are really only noticeable during encounters with high end mobs. Things like Vox, Nagafen, and other uber named mobs. In these situations problems with the hate changes become apparent. A cleric, druid, or shaman heals once...they get summoned immediately. This can be adapted to with Vox because this mob's health is capped and damage output is reasonable. Not so with other mobs. Velketor for example. The mob has more health than Vox/Naggy combined and quad hits for 840 damage a round as well as casts spells. It's damage output is such that multiple clerics using complete heal must be used to keep one tank alive. Any other healing spell is not an option because it doesn't get the job done. This cannot be done if each cleric gets summoned and killed in seconds after just one heal. Mob hate towards healing in high end encounters needs to be toned down. <P>This only illustrates another problem with high end mobs, especially those in Velious. Namely the absurdly high amount of hit points and damage output these mobs have. Some of these 'mortal' mobs are tougher than Gods! This is a poor substitute for AI. Your design team should re-think how high-end encounters in general work, especially now that the Donal's BP has been changed. Mob encounters that were designed with that item in mind in it's original state need to be re-tuned immediately.<P>An example of how a high-end encounter with Velketor might go as the game is now:<P>You get lots of high level people together, buff them as much as you can, then try to keep them healed and do as much damage as quickly as possible. There's no finesse here, no real strategy...just get in and bludgeon the thing to death. Hard? Yes. Fun? No.<P><BR>Now, an example of how it might be handled:<P>Same group of players...they get buffed and go in. Velketor has a few outer guards. When one key mob is killed it triggers another response...reinforments maybe or spell-trap. Players work their way through that encounter which triggers another one. Further down several more mobs await to ambush the players. They are already aggroed but do not rush in...they wait til the players are in range and unleash ranged weapons and spells...then engage the players. The players finally get up to Velketor himself. He has about 100k hitpoints and does about 100-200 melee damage at most during this encounter..same as any other giant. Surrounding him would be 3-4 elite guards that attack with Velketor. <P>There's no need to keep increasing the health/damage output of mob encounters to make them challenging...just put a little  more work into their set-up and design. Another point...there are always going to be a group of players who can beat anything and everything in your game. Eventually they'll find it easy. Such is life. Do NOT re-tune the game with them in mind. They are the elite..the top 1% and do not constitute the majority of your playerbase. Fires of Heaven is without question with that elite 1% in EQ. Please remember that most of us can't compete at that level and to stop making design changes that are targetted with that guild in mind. <P>Another idea...one that might allow you to challenge average guilds as well as the elite. Scale the encounters. Have a minimum number of mobs, resist rates, health, damage output that scales upwards based upon the average level of the players in the zone. The higher the players the tougher the mob encounter is to compensate. Loot should also be scaled. If you kill a mob on the 'expert' setting it should drop loot that is not available to those who beat it on the 'normal' setting. Dunno if this can be done somehow but it would be a better solution than tacking on another million hitpoints and an extra 1k damage per round. Would be a lot more fun I think for sure.<P><BR>Anyways, I hope you read this with a mind open to the possibility there needs to be changes and take these suggestions in the way they were meant...an objective and honest opinion with some suggestions for improving the game. You guys have done a great job...but as always your playerbase wants more. 8)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think this game is difficult enough, so why did Verant increase this difficulty ??? Playing a cleric is now too dangerous. The only way for a cleric to stay alive in a raid is to use 1 spell slot with divine Aura. then the cleric will stay alive, but he will not be able to cast heal on the other group members, and they might die.<P>And i can't imagine when fighting a Dragon.<P><BR>Yadan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan, <P>Lemme give you some of the feedbak that you are looking for. I have a 52 cleric and I have been in Karnors since the patch. EVERYTIME I cast Remedy with more than 1 mob I get aggroed. Not just sometimes BUT EVERYTIME. That includes aggroed even if the snarer class snares the Mob. I do not get aggroed when I cast a Celestial Heal, but then if all I do is cast Celestial Heal, whats the use of healing? <P>I dont really understand what warranted the changes that you made, but it is not fun healing and then getting the crab beat outta you till your just about dead, its a waste of my time and the groups time. <P>Maybe instead of just throwing out NERFS (which is what this is) you might want to TEST them more than just a few days. And then not get some really good feedback from the testers. <P>So now that you have been getting some feedback from the people that are still playing their cleric, how about giving us some feedback as well.<P>Thanks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bump<P>I'm a warrior, but this needs to be looked at very close. Cleric's and Warriors are getting the shaft with the so called "Balancing" changes. From Brads on mouth, a Warrior is the ( Meat Shield? ) Tank. Cleric is the healer. What gives Brad? You give Bards, Rangers and Paladin's the same defense as us now and give Druids a high lvl heal spell and now you screw clerics with this damn aggro patch.<BR>TEST THIS CRAP BEFORE YOU IMPLEMENT IT!<BR>Also, if you are serious about listening to our feedback, its obvious that 95% of the people do not like this patch. But we all know you want do a dang thing about it. You said the rogues accepted it. The only reason they did, is because it was shoved down there throat by your draconian ways of nerfing every dang thing in sight and they know you want change your mind.<BR>Boy I tell you, if I ran a business like you do with paying customers, I sure wouldnt be in business long. Hope you realise there are some new online games coming out and yuor about to get the shaft if you do not listen to your customers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just my two cents worth.<BR>While fighting in Sebilis, or even in Icewell Keep, I did notice some changes with aggro when healing, and it seemed more for 50+ heals vs. CH, although I could be wrong there I just could not med for a little bit after casting CH, until aggro was not on me.  However, yesterday I was in Sirens Grotto and did a CH on a ranger (hehe yeah I know a CH on a Ranger?) and the mobs (2 lvl 55 one was a rogue which BS'd for 333 hehe well that was one of the hits) we were fighting all aggro'd on me and I was dead in seconds.  Until this experience I didn't notice too drastic of a change...but as I cleric it makes me uneasy to think about healing someone just to cause my death.  I don't mind taking one for the team, but when the Cleric dies, the group evac's and it's time for CR.  Am not saying the changes are all bad, just saying that I think that an eye should be kept on this, as we had been fighting in the zone for awhile before this happened, although all other pulls had been singles.<P>Eclipsee Kindheart<BR>Cleric lvl 57<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Failleron I noticed your post, and I would like to comment.   I also noticed a change in the Kunark rules of hate and aggro.<BR>I am 24th level, and I was in Lake Of Ill Omen, I started in a group with a Monk, Shaman, 2 druids, 1 magician, and of course me.   We fought near the goblin ruins.<BR>We were all at full health when the first pull brought some green warriors over the hill.  No biggie I sit, and watch the fight, when one attacks me.   Okay, no biggie again, root, walk away, and sit.<BR>They die, I get the faction hits, and then our druid is in the ruins, the same warriors pop, and they immediately start running, not for him, but for me.   I didn't know what was up.  Of course I healed the group after the battle (Always the safest time if you can afford the lost HP in battle)<BR>Alright, figure this is a fluke. We go to Sarnak fort simply because green isn't my favorite color.<P>At Sarnaks we get 2 recruits, lose one magician and gain 1 Shadow Knight.  Okay, 2 tanks better than 1.    3 healers in group 2 23 druids, and 1 24 cleric. I haven't seen any extra agro issues in the other places in the world.   We start fighting the sarnaks.  I am watching.   There are two groups.     Mine, and another, 3 druids, 2 warriors, and a necro.<P>While in the fight, I G Heal the SK (Primary Agro at this point) The 2 Sarnaks attack me, (Normal) I stand there, and they are pulled off.   The only problem is the other group's sarnaks are also pulled to me.    They crossed their group, my group, and started beating on me.<P>I had to do some fast thinking, and a little pulling, and all in all I got by with getting them off of me. (Thanks to my SoW and my SK)<P>I was called a KSer, and was challenged 3 times (which I on principle declined)<P>Okay, here's the best part.   I didn't log this, and it happened twice, and I want someone to prove me wrong, because I think personally cleric's were just a little too easy for my level before this.<P>My group is attacking a sarnak adherant.  No idea what level they are, don't know, don't care, they were killing it.<P>I was sitting there monitoring the health bars, a good 30 - 40 feet away, standing still, not attacking, never hit the thing.   Never cast, not even a buff.      Then out of the blue, the thing gets to 1/2 health, and it rushes over and attacks, me and can NOT be pulled off.<P>Has this happened before to anyone?    Is this normal?   It happened twice, I am going to log the issue again if it happens, and I would like some response.  Thanks.<P>I don't have other characters that I play regularly if at all.   I don't want to play my other characters, but I can't level if I die everytime we attack a sarnak adherant and it's going to agro me just for watching the fight.<P>Now, the new hate rules, haven't affected me much in High Hold, West Commons, Oasis, Nektulos Forest, or anywhere else a Dwarf Cleric goes for Experience or money, but the whole Kunark thing makes me wonder about Failleron's post.  <BR>Could Kunark have gotten a little nerfed?   A slight glitch in the code?   Or a bad trip on my part.<P>Thanks for listening to the ramblings of a Dwarf Cleric, and Torvonnilous is, and always will be the place I call home.<P>Stonebegger Coldhammer (24th Cleric with a question)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

A wizard can delay their nukes until the tanks have generated enough aggro. But tell me, how can I learn from wizards in the case I mentioned?

Will wizards dump a big AoE nuke as soon as the puller comes back to save the pullers' life?<P>5) Let the puller dies:<BR>This should be best option as using my cleric epic, res don't even cost me 1 mana.<P><BR>Artemi Fategranter<BR>Level 55 Templar of Xegony<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>BTW, heya Alan... Joe and Mette say hello. Congrats on the new job. =)<BR>Anyway...<P>Just wanted to respond to a few of your recent chants on the Cleric problem.<P>On healing causing too much hate for Clerics to bear...<P>""...I would suggest that you play with the new changes before making these rather wild accusations...""<P>Fifth night in a row I've played my cleric. I have to say that playing in areas where encountering a 50+ level creature is possible is far too dangerous for clerics now. We are now back to the same erroneous healing mega taunt days of the beta. Except that it only applies to clerics that are over 50th level.<P>We have tried the new changes and they simply do not work. They "unbalance" the game for clerics and warriors specifically. The working version of EQ is now broken.<P>There are several flaws here that the team needs to consider.<P>1. Clerics who are just making a level range where they begin to encounter creatures over 50th level will not be prepared for these instant death situation. This is going to cause far too much frustration for these clerics that have never had to deal with it. Playing a cleric will loose it fun factor for them.<P>2. The Hate changes have made soloing classes more viable/desirable. What is the point to playing a class dependant on a group, when the group will have a difficult time finding a healing class that is willing to die for them several times a night? It is far easier and less frustrating to play a soloing class now. People are breaking out their old druids, necros, and wizards in record numbers because of the hate changes.<P>3. Hate was increased for high level healers (worse for clerics) yet, taunts for the melee classes we're either not touched or reduced. The warriors of the game are outraged that their taunt is rarely successful in high level fights. Compounded now that the single class they rely on is packing it up (cleric), they have no choice but to pack it up too.<P>I think that is the single most problematic thing about the new mega taunt healing, is that melees, specificaly warriors, ability to taunt creatures off of clerics is pretty much hopeless if there is only one or two melee's in a group.<P>4. Healing classes that group and actually do their jobs as healers can no longer meditate while combat is in progress. After getting beat to death for giving a heal, if a healer tries to sit to med, their hate goes back to the top of the list. In order to avoid instant death, the healer cannot meditate. This means that 50+ group encounters are going to take 3 times longer to recover from combats, since they cannot gain mana while in combat. This will mean that grouping parties are actually being penalized exp wise because they cannot pull on a constant basis. Again, soloing becomes far more desirable.<P>5. Clerics are no longer playable in Epic encounters. Clerics are 100% guaranteed to die after their first CH. How fun is that?<P>""It is a 'nerf'... Yes, healers now have to be more careful with their healing.""<P>I am so glad that you pointed that out for us. It isn't simply a "fix" but a nerf. Clerics get nerfed, but get nothing in return.<P>Careful is not a proper word for what clerics have to do now. We now have to play Russian roulette with our heals. "Do I heal him and die? Will he be able to get its attention. Or do I let him die and hope that someone else can kill it?"<P>""BUT! It's not going to mean the end of clerics in Norrath. For lower level clerics it's unlikely you'll even notice the change at all.""<P>True lower leveled characters wont notice at all. They will 100% safe from the effects of the "nerf" right up to the point they make 50th level and encounter their first 50+ mob. It is going to scare the hell out them, and chances are, they won't continue playing their Cleric they have been working on for the last 2 years.<P>Please understand that point. 2 Years you have been playing a specific class. Struggling just like everyone else in the game to level your character, only to suddenly instant die (or nearly die if your group is good) every time you encounter a 50+ mob.<P>This is not fair to players that dedicate that much time on a character.<P>It makes no sense that players won't feel the effects of the change for 2 years and then suddenly be thrown into the fire one day. "Change and adapt"... Sorry, won't happen. You will see far too many frustrated clerics giving up.<P>You won't see that with any other class. NO other class has as much frustration playing their class as Clerics do at the moment.<P>Yes, it won't mean the end for clerics in Norrath, it'll mean a significant number of 50+ clerics are going to retire however.<P>""And for higher level clerics, well, you probably won't notice it either.""<P>WRONG! I have to quote someone else here, "Does Verant actually play the game before they make these types of sweeping nerfs?"<P>We notice it. It is far too noticable. It makes the class unplayable/unfavorable/unenjoyable after 50th level. Again... No other class has that much frustration heaped upon them trying to play.<P>It is so noticeable; it makes me feel that your QA people don't actually QA the changes being made to the game. This change was never tested on the test server, so how did the team know that the changes being made wouldn't have this traumatic of an effect on clerics?<P>""But at least now the NPCs will be aware of how powerful the effects of healing are.""<P>Creatures already knew. I think that a creature would be more worried about the big ass warrior cleaving its skull in a million times a minute more than the healer healing him. That is not the case. Would you be more concerned with some loony doped up on PCP beating your face in? or the dealer that gave it him?<P>This reminds me of another computer game. The creature AI was built so specifically that its first target was always the healer. It made the game suck. It made the game impossible to win. It made the game sit on the shelf. It was a cheap way to make the game hard because the programmers had no idea how to build in logical AI functions to make the game difficult. Once players stopped playing, they completely revamped the AI to make it easier on the healers via a patch.<P>If continued, EQ will be shelved for a lot of clerics. That in turn will have a domino effect as more classes find themselves without the most needed class in the game.<P>""Someone stated it this way in a tuning meeting (and stealing good lines from my co-workers is part of my job): Just think about how angry it makes you when you've nearly got Vox dead and she casts a Complete Heal.""<P>Your guy in the tuning department needs to be fired. He is oblivious to the fact that Vox has 32,000 Hit Points and is able to strike back in multiple forms. Yes, we get mad, and beat her down again. Clerics however DO NOT have 32,000 hit points to deal with the angered creatures, nor do we have awesome defenses, counter attacks, or area effect dragon breath to nearly instantly kill off our opponents. That is by far the worst statement made in justifying the need to change the hate agro for heals.<P>""I only ask that you try it out before getting too upset about it.""<P>Again, we have. It simply does not work. A multitude of things needs to change for the cleric class in order for this wide sweeping "nerf" that affects our class (and the game as a whole) are balanced again.<P>Reconsider the success of taunts for melee classes. It should succeed a hell of a lot more than it does currently.<P>Reconsider the way taunt actually works. Simply farting puts the cleric back on the top of the list after a successful taunt. This needs to change.<P>Reconsider the effects of hate for sitting, OR make it so Clerics can meditate standing.<P>Reconsider specific cleric spells designed to save them from unrecoverable agro.<P>The Divine Barrier series needs to have its recast time reduced significantly. DB should be able to recast in 3 minutes instead of 20.<P>The Atone spell should be reduced in cast time and recast time. Cast time of instant is optimal, but 2 seconds would work fine. A recast time should be 15 seconds or less.<P>The root series needs a revamp. For the higher-level root/entangle spells, the chances of breaking should be nearly impossible. Remember, every hit that the creature takes allows them to check if they break it. This should not be the case. It should be in 10 second intervals, with a low chance of occurrence. For 100 mana, Paralyzing Earth should root the mob for upwards of 3 minutes with almost no chance of breakage.<P>Or... Just put healing hate back to the way it was.<P>I just want to wrap up by trying to put this point home to as many Verant people as possible...<P>Clerics are frustrating as hell to play now. No other class is as frustrating to play as a cleric at the moment. This creates a HUGE unbalancing effect in game play value.<P>Remember, we play this game to have fun. Not be frustrated to tears because the makers want to make the game "hard" for less than .0001% of the game playing community.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi!<P>I see alot of different points of view of why this is bad/good. Me myself I have played EQ for about 8 months now and I have dedicated the last five months to my cleric (only lvl 31 since I do have a job and not so much spare time). Lately (before the patch) I have been lacking the motivation to play since evertime I do, I have problems finding a group and when I do find one I always get aggroed on (was my own fault healed to early in the battle). <P>But now since this patch I feel no motivation what so ever to play my cleric again. Think I will just delete that character and start a mage/nec or something (that I can solo with). I thinks its sad that Verant has done this to the clerics and hope that Absor well hear what everyone is telling him (except those people who is out to make conflict) and correct these issues. I as an costumer has been very tolerant of Verants obvious shortcomings (play on E'ci and get disconnected at least twice every night due to the overpopulated server) but now Ive had it. <P>From now on I am going to play a char that I can solo with! Im so tired of being there for a group totally (healing, med, healing, med, healing, med etc etc.) and missing loots etc. But at least I could gain experience of it. But now, what do I get? Death... So Im creating another char instead that is not nerfed. <P>And for all you out there that think that the clerics are complaining... Well you have the druids and shamans now.. Me for myself will not be apart of the cleric community anymore  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> Hope that some of this will get through to you Absor (not counting on it though) so that at least the persistant people will continue to play clerics.<P>*disappointed former cleric*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

And he got agro'd almost everytime. <P>That place is bad enough with lag and mobs a thousand miles away agro'ing. Gating dragons etc. <P>Having to rez the clerics after each pull is not my idea of fun. Yes they basically got off scott free but I seem to recal them getting chewed on for chealing before you screwed them up with the last patch. <P>Oh btw. I'm a warrior. You know, the guys who you,Absor, ignored their suggestions to improve the class and made up your own. Gee if I could tuant worth piss after level 50 there'd be hope for cleric maybe.  <P>To the original poster, you're playing in kiddy lands where you're "testing".

</FONT><HR>Ok, you (you being Anthrax) post that clerics are about 10% of the EQ population, and then you post this dribble:<P>&gt;&gt;Result: 25-50% of the total EQ Cleric population quits EQ. The other 25-50% may restrict their playtime/not group or just continue playing like loyal/good little nerfees.&lt;&lt;<P>So, according to these numbers, around 15,000 people cancelled their accounts over this?<P>Um..... no. <P>Some other thoughts:<P>Anyone noticed that the dmg these high-lvl encounters hit for has been growing at a rapid pace? First the quad-hit for 200, then 500, and now I see it is up to 850. What's next? Is someone going to claim that Trak quad-death-touches?<P>Also, I find it especially amusing that so many of you have played since pre-beta or post beta or helped brad code the original game so you know more about the game then anyone else.

Reason is a CH has become the biggest AoE Taunt spell now in the game.  I have played my Wizard for over 2 years now and have attained the level of a 56 Evoker.  I can tell you that I would never cast one of my AoE spells unless I wanted to get every mob on me.  That is what you are telling the Cleric to deal with.  How can they?  There are only specific situations that Wizards even cast these types of spells yet healing is what the Clerics do.  Also, Wizards have the luxury of casting or not casting.  With the state of the game/Wizard class it don't make a hell of alot of difference one way or another if we nuke the mob one or two times.  The Cleric has no such luxury.  They either heal and safe the life of another or they let them die because they might build up too much aggro and die themselves?  What kind of a choice is this?<P>I see post after post of Clerics that are not having problems with this change.  As I have posted before they always have three points in common with thier posts.<P>1.  They have a high level Enchanter with them for crowd control.  This means that they are really only fighting one mob at a time and the effects of the AoE taunt of thier heals is negated.  What is a group to do without any means of crowed control?  The answer is hang out at the zone area and attempt to pull only 1 mob and if any more come zone out I guess.<P>2.  They are always in a location where mobs can be effectivly crowed controled.  In many places in Velious where the Magic Resistance on mobs is so high that crowed control is almost impossible and means sertain death to Clerics and the rest of the team if more then just a very few mobs are pulled.  Answer, I guess same point applies as above no matter what classes you have.  Pull to the zone and hope only a couple mobs are pulled or zone out to safety.<P>3.  They are never fighting against the mobs that can hit for obsean amount of damage very quickly which CH is the only way to be able to keep up with these mobs.  Answer, I can't think of any but to no longer even challange these mobs becuase it is a futile effort.<P>Conclussion:  Whether or not CH was broken as you seem to think that it was, you have developed the additional games around the way CH has worked for over 2 years.  Now you have changed the AI and have totally turned game balance on its head.  It's funny, now I'm almost glad I chose be be a Wizard!

Now that great slow effect, which people never seemed to give enough credit, is combined with superior healing at 51.  Forget your cleric!  You can slow the mob WAY down so he's dealing far less damage and you can heal pretty well too.

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt; I haven't played my cleric since the patch. I have no desire to. <BR>&gt;&gt; My idea of fun is not "One heal and die". As a matter of fact, <BR>&gt;&gt; after being disgusted with the changes in the patch message, I've <BR>&gt;&gt; logged in for a total of about 25 minutes."<P>&gt; And therein lies the problem.<P>Not really, no.<P>You do have a point, in that it is at least theoretically possible that the problem is not as bad as believed by those who have not tested it.  <P>To claim that the whole issue is merely people overreacting, and thus to dismiss so high-handedly the claims made by people who have played their clerics and have died because of the nerf, however, is a slap in the face.<P>Verant has a test server.  It's Verant's job to test a prospective change before making it go live.  You failed to do this.  We are not paying you to be your beta testers.<P>In any event, even if the heal-hate nerf was necessary, it should not have been done at the same time as the proc nerf.  These two changes, which make for such a deadly combination, should have been spaced well apart, to give us a better chance of adjusting.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt; People, these changes have no effect on 51 and below mobs. <P>That is not true.<P>The change has a much greater effect on 51 and above mobs.<P>But all mobs are affected, so long as the cleric spell is level 34 or above.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
