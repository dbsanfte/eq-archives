</FONT><HR>Absor,<BR>   One other thing I would like added to the list that I did not see.  I believe this would be a HUGE benefit to any bards twisting and make twisting 10 times better without "automating" it.<P>Currently when you are singing a song ANY song you hit will stop that song, but then you have to hit the next song again to start a new one.  Is there any way to "toggle" this switch so that everytime we hit a song it is played?  Ie, when I'm trying to twist and using my healing song, a haste song and a damage song the following occurs:<P>Hit hotkey for healing, start healing, hit hotkey for haste, healing stops, hit hotkey for haste, haste starts, hit hotkey for damage, haste stops, hit hotkey for damage, damage starts...repeat<P>A simple toggle allowing us to change to the following would rock:<BR>Hit hotkey for healing, start healing, hit hotkey for haste, stops healing & starts haste, hit hotkey for damage, stops haste & starts damage.  This minor change would cut the number of button pushes in half, yet still require us to manually "twist" in order to get our abilities going....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The one thing this doesnt address is how to stop the songs. to stop them, just hit the gem/hotkey for the song that is playing. <P>Most of the issues brought up here seem to play to the higher lvl bards (50+), well you dont see many bards of that level. Why? Because the problems extend way down into the mid levels. We need defense upgrades to start around 25-30 with parry, then maybe evade or somthing else around 35-40. Plus the issuse of chain AC on plate and caster class HP's need to be addressed more than this lvl 57 songs should doo 50 more damage. <P>Please dont forget the little people!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Amen Palfas!<P>It's not like the bard hits 50 and starts sucking. I've sucked for years, and I'm only lvl 38, but I'm a glutton for punishment. Absor, please pay heed to those of us requesting fixes for the pre-50 game, as we represent a larger majority of your leveling bards, and are more likely to give up the bard for another class. Bards are rare from lvl 20 on, and even a twinkie bard rarely makes it to see manasong. There is a reason for this: Bards are fun to twink, but are terribly hard to play. We can't tank in a fight, we can't deal enough damage to warrant us being in the group for that reason, and even at level 10, when we get our first haste song, by level 12, enchanter have a better version which makes ours pointless. <P>I'm tired of being a mana battery. Make me more than a one trick pony, please.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Would some of you "low" level bard players please back off? Of course bards of level 50-plus aren't going to ask for fixes for a level 10 bard, any more than a level 10 bard is going to present the issues for 50-plus bards.<P>What you DON'T see, however, is level 50-plus bards asking that the concerns of lower level bards be ignored. So please don't ask that our concerns are ignored in favour of yours :-P<P>If you people are dissatisfied with your bards pre-level 50, you will definitely abandon them before you reach 56, as things stand.<P>PS I have a second bard who is also named Solwen  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Level 16, great fun to play grouped or solo and, IMHO, well-balanced.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Also, the level 52 song, Nillipuss' March of the Wee, is useless. It gives a fair amount of ac and a bit of agi, but due to the rune component to it it goes away as soon as you get hit. Either make the song absorb more than the whopping 30 damage it does right now or remove the rune component, as the 49 song absorbs more damage anyway. At 52+, if something is hitting for 30 damage or less than I'm not going to worry about trying to prevent that. This song gives ac and agi to everyone who's not getting hit, and just temporarily eats up a buff slot for those who are.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Starling_Bane: Well said, I would go further in stating lets not quible internally. We need to work together to balance the Bards. Low level, mid level and upper level Bards are not comparable in damage out put or healing prowess to that of any of the other hybrids.<P>Low Level (1-20): Bard melee does not come close to comparing to the other Hybrids. 1h weapons only, single attack does not compare to 2h weapons at these levels. The songs are somewhat comparable although many have very high resist rates. The lower hit points and limited defense skills start to have a significant effect on the Bards tanking or in-ability to take hits.<P>Mid Level (20-40): Bard melee continues to not be comparable to the other hybrid classes. Double attack kicks in more often than dual wield and the 2h weapons out damage the 1h weapons with their double attack status. Spell damage in this range does not come close to comparing to the hybrid classes. Spell resists continue to be a problem, and many songs are not used in a group setting, or dungeon setting because of it. Untwinked players will start using instruments in order to increase their damage out put in battles, which decreases their pitiful melee skills to a 1h punch. Once you hit 32, groups are more open to accepting you because of the song gained at this level. The low hit points starts to take its toll even more in that you are almost incapable of taking the quad 100pt hits.<P>High levels (40-60): I cant even touch this issue, My bard is only level 35. I believe that the issues in the lower levels still apply however, better melee, better survivability, better song damage, less resists.<P>Twisting: Is a major issue for low speed connection, slow computer people. Also can be considered anoying.<P>Soloing: 1-35 I have been able to solo, albiet difficult and slow at times. If Bards are suppose to be a group 'enhancing' class, perhaps soloing should be looked at and nerfed if necissary. However, before killing soloing Bards, I strongly suggest enhancing the Bard group benefit.<P>Mana Regen: Get rid of mana consumption for songs or have all songs consume mana. If you dont want a bard chain nuking, increase the time it takes for the song to cycle. Adding mana consumption was probably just a work around to begin with.<P>Gotta wonder if anyone is reading these though... Could just be a total waste of time. =(<P>Tavern Tp'ing LOLOLOLOLOLOL!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>UNDER_DOG<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I see 3 or 4 things that deserve commenting, first is song damage, party songs are more important, running around like a fool and killing mobs at no risk to themselves is a hobby of some bards, but it gets away from the idea behind the class, so if it is an issue make sure its backseat.<P>Pick Locks optimal skill to cap at would be 200.  It's a rogue's class defining ability at 201 skill (L51).<P>As for the "Casting animation on new songs", I can't speak for other bards, but I enjoy having different animations than the wind/brass, drum/lute...(example niv's 47),  It makes the movement a bit more fluid and non-repetitive.<P>Puretone seems to work VERY VERY well with "Singing" skill based songs.  It allows instrument based songs to be sung with weapons out.  This disc probably doesn't need review, it's already pretty useful.<P>Dance Mez?  Funny idea.  Probably just lead me to duel more;p<P>If all the ideas went in, I still wouldn't see a reason to take a bard over an enchanter in situations where crowd control wasn't very needed.  An enchanter will always be taken in the risky situations, I'd just like to see some obvious bonuses for taking the less traveled route.  I've stated several times that I think making bards haste better than enchanters would be a good way to go about this, but you decide.  (I'm aware of the haste stacking thing, that just makes us group better with an enchanter, not have any advantages of our own (not saying haste stacking shouldnt be implemented))<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Thanks Absor. Nice list, and it would be great if we could get a little attention to these things in the future.<P>All in all, the only thing I would like to say is ... I would like to see my Bard "needed" and "wanted" at any level, just like any other class. I just find it sad that an Enchanter can do the job for himself/herself, and the Bard is basically not needed.<P>I am a part of a large guild. You know what they ask for? Always an Enchanter, a Tank, and a Wank ... never a Bard. This is the way of this game from 40 on, and it would be nice if things could be balanced so that there was a need for the Bard in the groups. Along these lines is the punishment factor. We were doing the Icewell Keep, and the only person in our Guild that could not gain XP in there, was our highest level'd Bard in the Guild. All she had was a Ykesha and a Harpoon of the Depths, hardly two major whoop weapons, and was playing mana. She died twice more than anyone else in the whole Guild. <P>It is really hard to believe that the mana song is of a higher taunting nature than anything else in the game at that level, that the Bard will end up taking so much damage that it can't play and is not playable. Thus, you end up finding that most higher level players and Guilds will not use Bards much, and will substitute with someone that can do real damage ... AND SURVIVE!<P>In essence, or perhaps you don't know, a dead Bard is worthless to a group! I just would like to know how a dead Bard can be effective and "powerfull" in any group? The REZ won't come for some time (specially the planes), and this really places the Bards in a bad place all around. How we gonna get levels? How we gonna get the pieces for the Epic?<P>NOT!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Lullaby (15) - Keep it AE, remove the secondary resist and make insturment use help alot. Risk vs Reward here, the bard is racking up alot of hate on all the mobs at once with this and a few resists could mean their death. <P>Level 57 Song - Just remove the INT/WIS debuff component and make it suck ALOT more mana per second.<P>Bard 'snare' songs - Make these lower MR making it hard to get it on initially but much easier as this effect will be on them keeping the MR low for the repeated snare attempts.<P>Meditate - Denon's Despirate Dirge is often refered to as the 'Bard HT'. I believe it does a 250DD AOE. My suggestion would be to either increase the damage it does to about 400DD AOE or keep it as is and give bards an inherit double mana regen rate from level 1 wether sitting, standing, running, laying down bleeding  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> I also hear a charm song of higher level uses mana, please fix this as I dont think mana useage should be appropriate as they are already risking death should charm break suddenly.<P>New Song Suggestions - If your going to make any songs remove poison/diseases make it like a cure poison spell chain cast every tick. Eventually it will come off but will have still done its damage.<P>Flashing Icons - When I play my warrior I know a bard is doing their job if I see 2, 3 or 4 blinking icons blinking. Keep it as is.<P>Temple Quest for Weapon - Hows about a 'weapon' that can be used as an insturment as well. Would most likely befit a percussion insturment or a weapon that can be wielded while playing insturments (like a stick for a drum)<P>Lute of the Howler - Leave it in, Bards are a hybrid and I think they are Rogue/Enchanter hybrid type and seems to fit rather well. No other class is as close to the Enchanter as a Bard.<P>HPs - I'd like to see Bard HP's up there along the lines of Rogues/Rangers considering they're a plate class the lower HPs (but higher than before?) but better armor would help out somewhat against the agro they recieve.<P>Mez Song Dance - I dont know about how you can add dancing animations for everything BUT if you increase the effectiveness of the level 15 song you could change the response message from 'Soandso nods' to 'Soandso dances to the music'<P>Melee Damage - We dont do nearly enough melee damage at higher levels we often use insturments only. How about unlocking the off-hand damage restrictions for Bards as it would help them and make sense somewhat (they get dual wield rather early in the game when compared to other hybrids and their abilities...

When I think of bard, i think of actor/deciever, like the con-men with the card game on the side of the street. Well in acting, i think they should master the skill to play dead, makes sence eh?

</FONT><HR>After thinking it over a bit, I have come to the conclusion that the option of auto twisting songs is a good one.  My reason is not really the convenience factor, although that would be nice, but that it would be more in keeping in character with the class.   <BR>My logic in this is that a main component to bards historically was as a communicater.  Yet most of the time in battle my bard is the guy not doing a lot of talking to the others in his group because in order to talk I have to stop hitting those hotkeys.  So occaisonally in battle I can get out a warning, but for the most part twisting songs.  Even the option of hotkeying a couple of songs together for an auto twist does not answer this problem, because while the hot key macro is running, you can't talk either.<BR>I do like the idea that this autotwist would be an option that you can turn off in order to do things the old way since the current way of twisting songs is pobably a little more versatile.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am a newbie so I will talk about some low level stuff, and my English is not too well, please forgive me.<P>ITEM: Gate<P>DESCRIPTION: As all I know Bard is the only class need to run across two island(or four?) in order to buy their spell, you know how upset when I know I need to run to Kelethin to buy the level 8 song "Kelin's Lugubrious Lament" when I am a Bard that born in Qeynos ? Run to there ? It take how many hours ? So you say I can looking for a port ? How can a level 8 newbie have that much money to pay for one ? Looking for free porter is time consuming and paying for a port to buy spell mean cost of the spell increase, buying many spell at once is also not possible for a newbie since a newbie have too many thing that need to spend money, armor, weapon etc.. so a personal gate will be nice, you can make it can only cast in the Bard Guild and only can gate to bard guild, cost *all* of your mana etc...<P>ITEM: Mana<P>DESCRIPTION: Bard song is weak some of them near useless, why ? Because you can cast while walking and cost no mana.. please... can you make some way for me to use my mana ? If is not funny to FM all the time, I would like to cost my mana to incease the effect of my song, say have a abilty to choice use mana or not when sing, if I use my mana then the effect will become better or less likely being resist or will take hold for a reasonable long period etc... but I think it is hard to make such a change right now, but it is nice to have some cost mana version of some old song.<P>ITEM: Channelling<P>DESCRIPTION: Every caster have the ability to regain concentration, how about Bard ? You know for a Bard it is dispell all the 3 effect<P>ITEM: Do a little of everything quite well<P>DESCRIPTION: A Bard is a class that do a little of everything quite well but master of none, yes I agree that I can do a little of everything but *not* well, below is some example :<P>Meditate - Cap at level 1, I am level 30 right now but the speed to mem a lvl 1 song is somewhat slower that a level 4 Mage mem his newest spell<P>Safe Fall - Cap at 40, with that level I can't jump from anywhere that someone will start to think it is high without taking any damage, this skill level is some what for our speed song only right now<P>Hide - Cap at 40, skill 40 don't mean you have 40% change to success, and 40% change to success is somewhat useless... and can you please change the message of hide ( as well as sneak ) so that we know am I successfully hide ( sneak ) ? I press F9 I change my view and view myself hided but everyone saw me as well as mob.<P>Forage - Cap at 55, With this skill level this skill just can not become my food source... can you please raise this skill to a level that I can find food most of the time but I won't find most or any special item with this skill ?<P>ITEM: Language Song<P>DESCRIPTION: Here is and idea, maybe it is good for adding some more effective song, I don't know, what I mean that a Song that you need to know the language in order to sing it, and the song is prefer to get from a quest as well<P>ITEM: Cast Time<P>DESCRIPTION: In real life, 30s is a song, 10min is a song, 1hr is a song, and the song take effect after finish singing the whole song is also make sense, why don't make some song have long cast time ( and cost mana ) but have better effect ? You know longer cast time for a Bard mean it have a greater change being stun, and it make sense to have better effect, e.g. sing for 1 min. and cost me 600 mana for a group buff that will take hold for reasonable long period of time<P>ITEM: Selo's Accelerando<P>DESCRIPTION: I can see the reason can't use in indoor, but I really didn't see the reason why this song can't sing in indoor... And everyone know Bard is the faster class, so I think make this song can sing indoor won't hurt any class</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

This is a crock of a list most of it is exactly what he sayed not to worry about video glitches ( bard drums ) and quest things. All the problems with the class the fact that we can do nothing as well as any other class period and we can only do 3 things at once; bob gets new spells yay he can now add new buff dmg etc to arsenal --bard gets new song he can still do 3 things.

</FONT><HR>&lt;quote&gt;<BR>Although I *personally* don't begrudge you the Werewolf Lute, please let me explain the thinking so there's no resentment.<P>Enchanters are supposed to be "Illusionists" -- we're even called that at later levels. Yet effective with this item, the *only* unique form we have was removed. Enchanters have been asking for additional illusions from the beginning, being told there was no additional memory for this. Since then other forms have been added but enchanters were denied these forms because "It's something unique for that class."<BR>&lt;/quote&gt;<P>Well, as a player, I am sorry for he enchaters. They have been asking for new illusions for a long time, but yet VI keep disappointing them. However, that doesn't means chanters should point their fingers to bard for having Lute of the Howler. Don't blame bard for your misforturn. Because chanter don't get new illusion, then bard shouldn't get any from the bards? That doesn't sounds right to me.<P>Just one simple fact about sharing abilities, if you chanters are willing to give up clarity, then you chanters will have the rights to complain about our lute. Us bard used to be the only class that has mana regen ability, and I never recall us bard make it such a big of a deal when VI give this unique ability to chanters.

</FONT><HR><BR>I'm sorry, Absor; I do not find this a very good list for the following reasons. Are these the only issues to be addressed? What I'd like to see is a few comments about where you (VI) see the bard in your game and what you see as reasonable and not; a background for the bard class if you will. This will help steer us - at the moment we are a jack-of-all trades class and in many ways don't know what to comment on, except for existing bugs. Can we please have feedback on status items NOT on your list, and reasons for non-implimentation; that would make me a lot happier.<P>Predominatly, you're dealing with existing bugs, rather than sailing 'fresh' waters. Yes, we all would love bug fixes, but we'd also like enhances in line with other classes and the use of a little imagination on the development team's behalf, rather than just fixing existing code. You seem to be taking the path of least resistance. Fixing what was broken is not balancing.<P>Again, a few points that spring to mind:<P>1) Give us an icon for mana song. This will save us getting told 'play mana' at least once an hour and would be an across-the-board benifit.<P>2) Increase in defense cap makes no sense and seems to be a simple 'keep-em-happy' enhancement route to take. post 50 (when extra defence raises kick in), we do not have the need for it (we are non-taunters and do not tend to get hit much unless we're on CC). From a RP point of view, why should an entertainer have the same defense as a knight or highly trained warrior? Jumping back to thread 5, yes defence is hard to raise, but it does happen eventually, as higher XP demands give greater oppertunity at increase per level. Aggro list manipulation is a good way to get increases. Ask for mobs to be rooted - then either manipulate aggro to get hit (heck, I can taunt off a 59th ranger in this situation, much to his chargrin), or simply ask tanks to not taunt. I would rather be enhanced in another direction that makes sense.<P>3) A small (5%) haste song that stacks and does not require an instrument. This will make a bard more worth having in a group with a chanter or shammy or as part of a riad featuring an enchater epic. The current instrument required song is useless - that 5 or 10% increase for the others means that the mob isn't taking bard melee damage (pitiful, I know - but it is probably at least 5% of group output) and takes up a twist slot that could be used for something useful.<P>4) Faction. specifically that entertainers were traditionally viewed as 'neutral' and could be welcomed in any land. ie improved starting faction, improved faction song or modification to positive faction enhancements. I made a lengthly string of comments on this. Any chance of a little feedback? I think I was the only person to offer a point of view on this topic as it is not 'combat' orientated, but rather a utility issue. It makes sense, it fits with the class (I can think of nothing more fitting in fact) and is not unbalancing. <P>5) Something, anything for us melee-wise. As is, if the group has a 'chanter, or indeed often just a root-parker then at higher levels we are usually less wanted than any other melee, hybrid, or indeed pet class. On multi-group ops, every buff and debuff is handled by speciality classes (even if not in the same group), leaving healing and damage dealing as the main in-group activity. A little more ability inside groups at these levels would be nice and a small melee tweak would be an easy path. Pallies and SKs are defensive, rangers offensive and we really should be middle ground. Our damage output is very low. Although we have duel weild, we lack the double attack of others. SKs and Pallies both have the option of 2-handers (we do not, neither should we) to offset some of this problem. More to the point, SKs and pallies both get OBSCENE one-handers that any tank would kill for to offset their non-duel weild advantage. So we are offensivly the weakest melee, hybrid or pet class.<BR>Defensivly (and we're talking tank-ability here), we lack a taunt key and the damage ability to attract a mob's attention (except lower levels where song taunt gives us aggro), making us undesired even defensivly.<BR>  A duel weild capped at 50, a slight offense increase, backstab capped at 50 or a high level 'bellow' would cheer us up no end.<P>Siranui<BR>ToD<BR>Torv<BR>Forteymj@hotmail.com<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Bards have the worst melee output of any hybrid. Our melee output is around that of a Shaman who spent time on a weapon of worth. I'm only going to deal with Shadowknights and Paladins in explaining why because I think Rangers are supposed to have a higher damage output comparable to other hybrids as rogues are to warriors. Pallies and Shadowknights get Double Attack, Bards get Duel wield seems even but it's not. Bards are the only Duel Wielding class that does not get double attack. As a result the way duel wield is balanced against two-handed weapons is the ratio of two one-handed weapons is slightly higher then that of <BR>one two-handed weapon but there are more skill checks duel wielding. Therefore having having duel wield is really only the same as having the ability to use two-handed weapons. That means that the melee damage output of Bards is a lot lower then a paladin with a two-hander of comparable power. So do we need double attack? I wouldn't agree as double attack would give us to much power the melee of a ranger plus our abilty to keep a couple of DoTs stacked on it. If it was capped low it would only cause confusion and frustration and would be hard balance. The only way to fix our pitiful damage output is to either give up and call us pure casters(I consider myself a pure caster in denial) or give us a line of Bard only weapons design to be balanced in the game with duel wield and no double attack. They would have a higher ratio and be Bard only. This is because our melee skills are different from all others but there is no weaponry that takes advantage of that.<BR>I have seen few other one-handed weapons for pallies and shadowknights that have almost the ratio of two-handers(dragonshard something). They are balanced in damage output cause these classes do not get duel wield. We need something of the same. Final note: Increase our hp a Gnome magician within a level of me had the same hp as I did. Admit it that's just not right.<P>So Bard only weapons and Bard hp increase. Fix stacking though that has been run into the ground.<BR>   Thuringwethil Tinuviel<BR>   'I come not from the shadows that surround you,<BR>    I come from the shadows in your own mind.'</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There is no doubt that bards need more offensive power post 50.  I'm a level 52 bard with good equipment and die consistently to 3 level 30 mobs.  Wherease my level 45 magician can consistently kill the same mobs easily and quicker.  If I'm dying to a few mobs that are over 20 levels lower than me, something is SERIOUSLY wrong with this class!<P>I don't really think bards should be better at melee in order to boost offensive power.  Instead our greater offensive power should be in our songs.  Melee should be a supplement to the damage we can do with our songs, post level 50.<P>I can understand the need to keep bards as a defensive class, but post level 50 I should be able to hold my own against weaker mobs.  In the example above, I failed miserably, and this was with some of the best bard equipment in the game.<P>Another thing to add to the defensive vision of this class is the need for higher AC.  One thing that comes to mind is "Royal Frosted Velium" armor, which all plate classes can wear EXCEPT bards.  It seems bards are being treated like a chain armor class and not plate..  This should be changed.<P>Our DoT line songs should be improved post level 50, significantly.  As well as brusco's boa****l bellow, dennon's desperate dirge and the level 55 DD song (have it's refresh time at least halved).<P>Bards should be able to raise their meditation skill to the level of other hybrids.<P>By the way, the level 50 and 60 "ervaj" songs can be used with the epic weapon (I'm assuming, since the epic acts as all instruments).  So I don't see a need to change these line of songs.  Although currently the difficulty of the bard epic seems too high, namely the dragonscales, but this is off topic and too lengthy to discuss.<P>Bard haste should stack with all other haste spells.<P>The werewolf lute is fine.  I disagree with what has been said here about "one full group can easily get this item, allowing every bard twink to be a WW".  I think this is very unrealistic.  I have been to the Ice Kobold lair in Velketor's Labyrinth where this drops and I can tell you that TWO full groups of level 50-55 could not even kill the Ice Kobolds here without dying and/or evac'ing.  The lute drops from the named, which in comparison to the Ice Kobolds we fought was around 5 levels higher.  SO, unless you have a full group of 60's with all of the best gear in the game, have a perfectly balanced group, and use the right tactics here, can get the lute.  Obviously this is by no means easy, so no, you won't be seeing a lot of bard twinks with WW form.  Unless they are in an uber guild.  Generally speaking then, this item and the illusion will not be readily available to bards.  However the enchanter illusion is.  The enchanter GROUP WW form is also easier to obtain than this lute.  I have certainly seen more enchanters with group WW form than bards with this lute.  Also take into consideration the possible level restriction of the lute's illusion.  I assume it's post 50 only.  So in effect there will be no bard twinks with WW form.  On my server I have only seen one maybe two bards with this lute.  Also need I point out the reluctance of the appropriate classes and levels (again, unless this is an uber guild) to follow you into this dungeon so that you can get "some silly bard lute that they could care less about".  This same reason is also why it is difficult to obtain the dragonscales needed for the bard epic.<P>Thanks for listening.<BR>Erato Level 52 Half Elf Bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor/Verant- <P>I would assume that just from the sheer magnitude of posts, you missed some very well reasoned dialog, and a lot of important issues got lost in the mix. So rather than go back and touch on the little issues, I just want to point out what I think are the BIG ONES for the balance of the post-50 bard:<P>#1: THE PRESENCE OF A HIGH LEVEL ENCHANTER NEGATES THE NEED FOR A BARD. Our hastes are not as good and do not stack, and our Charm / Mez / Fear is inferior and unstackable. A single enchanter can keep up to 3 groups with full haste buffs and clarity, while mezzing and charming. The bard can only help his immediate group, and now is left with  few ways to help them, other than resists and manasong. It is rare that one class so clearly negates the need for another, but the presence of an enchanter DOES have this effect in high-level encounters. <P>#2: BARD MELEE ABILITIES DO NOT INCREASE AT THE RATE OF OTHER CLASSES, POST 50. A bard will always be less effective than other melee classes, but the gap widens to the point that a melee bard is of minimal effect in post-50 encounters, and hence undesirable.<P>#3: BARD HASTE NEEDS TO STACK IN SUCH A WAY THAT HAVING A BARD IN A GROUP IS DESIRABLE. This means that if you put a bard in a full group, the capability of the group should increase more than putting in another melee type. In other words, a bards combination of melee + haste + songs for everyone in the party needs to be more effective than simply adding another melee type. Whether you require the bard to melee, or use instruments entirely, doesnt really matter, the math just needs to work out that the group is AT LEAST AS WELL OFF WITH A BARD. <P> (Note: You listed this one, but seemed to miss the reasoning: There is no need for a bard in the group if other haste is available, as haste can be supplied by someone outside the group, and having the bard in the group will lower overall group damage output, even if the bard uses his current (5%) haste stacking song.)<P>Note that these three issues are all interrelated. The goal is to make bards a desired and useful class in the post-50 environment, particularly in long duration (Velious-style) epic battles that last several minutes. <P>I did post a long list of pre-50 issues that will could help fine tune the class, but I believe none of them are as critical as the three issues I have listed above. <P>Thank you for your attention.<P>-Belark Songstrider<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have never posted on one of these forums but I feel I have to.  My main is a bard of the 33rd verse and I think part of the challenge is picking and choosing what songs to play at any given moment as well as twisting them, no matter how difficult or repetative it may seem.  I just think some of the other bards are looking for an easy way out.  If you want a class that a little less time consuming to play, play a monk.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>There are a few things I'd like to see added to the list, and I'll explain as concisely as I can.<P>Unlike any other 'caster' type class in the game, we are forced to work nearly every second that we are fighting, non-stop, to keep our effictiveness equal to or greater than other people in the group.<P>As such, it is very difficult to do so when our song's are resisting as badly as they do.  If I receive resist's in the 70% range on blue's and green's (as you noted, velious creatures, but 'the hole' is yet another zone where my song's just don't like to stick), then my effictiveness is almost nill, and I'm simply soaking up experience.  The only people that will want me along is those that know me and will group with me simply for my company if nothing else.  Eventually they will start moving more and more towards having someone in their group that provides more efficiency, then I'll be forced to suck it up, be a mana battery, and swing weapons only to deal about 25% what I could be dealing if I wasn't being resisted so much.<P>I won't go into more detail, since you were already intending to bring this up, but I wanted to stress the point.  We are in a way in the same boat as wizards on this one.  Not only do they get resisted a lot, but the amount of damage they can deal over time is gimped big time.  Unfortunately for them, their even more useless in high level encounters than we are, except when it comes to evacing people.<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<BR>Kelin's Lugubrious Lament (level 8)<P>This song's (apparent) use is to lower the attack radius of an NPC.  The message received by the user is 'a bat looks sad' when successful.<P>Bard's have the ability to lull creatures with this song similar to enchanter's, also similar to the druid/ranger 'harmony' spells.<P>Bard's and enchanter's can both use their lull-type spells/songs indoors, whereas harmony is restricted to outdoor use only.  Due to an enchanter's lack of tanking abilities however, they typically are not asked to pull, therefore if lull pulling is to be used, it's the bard who does it.<P>The problems I have with this song are this:<P>The range on it is alright, however there are creatures with a huge attack radius, especially in velious.  In order to lull them successfully, the only possible way to do it is if i can get above or below them on the Z plane so that they are not attacking me (which is somewhat an exploit since you can use a song/spell from any height above/below a creature so long as it's within the x/y radius the song requires).  This of course is not possible when there is no way to get above the creature, therefore making the song not quite so usefull (which btw is the case in most circumstances)<P>The resist's on this song make it a very deadly thing to use.  I would place it's level of resistability about on par with selo's consonant chain, which is to say, VERY high for this type of song.  Selo's helps us prevent trains by stopping something from running away when it's nearly dead.  This song is to prevent trains from coming during pulls.  The latter depends on lack of resist's a LOT more than selo's consonant chain does.<P>Duration seems to be a problem.  As is, a bard can't feasibly lull more than 2, maybe 3 creatures (if he's lucky).  Each tick last's roughly 5 seconds.  The amount of time it takes after lulling the first creature, targeting the 2nd, lulling it, targetting the third, lulling it, and pulling a 4th ... you can see where the problem would arise ... as the 4th is starting to come at me after I've begun attacking it, the 1st and possibly 2nd creature's lull will wear off (if both landed within the same tick, 1 & 2 will both come) ... that's if my luck wasn't very high and I had already spent too much time re-targeting & lulling the 2nd & 3rd, and trying to pull the 4th and 1 & 2's lull hadn't already broken, in which case I may end up with 4 in my lap instead of 1-2.  I realize this is an inherent risk when using this song, but just adding one more tick to this song would make it extremely usefull to have memorized.<P>When this song wears off, there is no message given to the user.  I don't know how harmony and other lull-type spells work, but it seems to me that if charm, mesmerize, dot's, and other offensive spells warn me that my spell/song has worn off (heck, even buffs cast on pets tell the owner of the pet they've worn off), then it would seem to me that this song should inform me as well.<P>Following are some suggested improvements for this song, take your pick which you like, or perhaps take them all to the team and let them decide:<P>Suggestions for improvement on the range would be to make instruments affect it's range, ie., allowing a normal stringed instrument to double it (as with any other song, using an instrument doubles the effectiveness), and allowing magical instruments to affect the range even more-so.  Also be sure that if any improvements to it's range are implemented that the range at which the message 'a bat looks sad' is sent to the client.<P>The resistability I feel should be determined by charisma as well as your instrument.  As far as I can tell, the amount of charisma I have doesn't seem to affect it, nor does using a stringed instrument with the song.<P>Duration being increased by use of instruments would be a nice thing.  I realize duration is determined by tick's, and not actual time, but it may be something to consider.<P>Warn us that the song has actually worn off.<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>Cinda's Charismatic Carillon (level 11)<P>This song is a temporary faction change until the player enters another zone, or logs off.<P>I have only two problems with this song, one is the range on the song, and the other is that no wind instrument affects how well this song works. (this IS in fact a wind instrument.  When played with a wind instrument in-hand, it uses a wind instrument animation, whereas using a stringed instrument doesn't do any such thing.  I believe the person who said it was actually a stringed song was confusing it with lugubrious lament which IS a stringed song)<P>Suggested improvements on this song:<P>Allow instruments to increase range, and singing the song to keep the current range.  I feel the range should be increased due to the attack radius of some creatures in the game, dragons and giants especially.  I don't know about doubling the range on it as most song's do double their effectiveness when used with an instrument as opposed to just singing it, but a marginal increase would be nice.<P>As for how much the faction goes up with and without an instrument, I know from my own testing that this is the case.  While doing faction work in velious, I sung the song on a creature and went dubious to indifferent, then did the same with a flute in-hand, to find that I was still indifferent.  I then went and completed a quest ONE time, checked my faction again, and I was up to amiable.  I sung the song on the creature again, knowing that it would immediately go to the faction level that singing would take it to, and found that I was amiable still.  So either the increase from singing to wind instruments is so miniscule as to be unnoticeable, or it's not working.<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>Brusco's Boa****ll Bellow (level 12)<P>This song has 2 main effects, with 1 side effect to one of the main effects.  First off, it deals a single jolt of direct damage, it then knocks the target back (which also tend's to interrupt a caster).<P>The problem with this song is that it's use is limited to lower levels.  At 47, each time I sing the song, I can deal approximately 24 damage, which ends up meaning that I can sing it 4 times every 3 ticks for a total of 96 damage every 3 ticks, or approximately 384 damage a minute. (assuming 5 second ticks)  The knockback effect on the song does not increase as I go up in levels, and the only reason it interrupted casters was because it knocked the target back.  At higher levels, npc's are no longer being interrupted simply by moving them, or if your lucky and they do, they almost always resume casting.  Rather than relying on the knockback effect to interrupt the caster, I feel it should actually have a 0 second stun effect attached to it.  If it's going to deal so little damage, it should at least provide us with something usefull as we get up into the higher levels.<P>Suggested fix: Increase distance creature is knocked back with levels, 0 second stun effect for interrupting cast's.<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>Lyssa's Cataloging Librretto (level 14)<P>Could you have it report to the person singing the song the item another person is holding?<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>Tarew's Aquatic Ayre (level 16)<P>Put this one up there with aria of eagles and sonorous clouding.  If you need good reasons for it, see the reasons given for the other two.  When fighting in kedge keep, this song can really make a difference, especially if phin decides to dispell your group's EB.<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>Guardian Rhythms (level 17)<P>This song currently can't be stacked with chant of battle.  I hesitate to point it out as it may entail a nerf, but chant of battle stacks with elemental and purifying rhythms, which both provide AC to the recipients of the songs, so I'm curious as to the reasoning behind not allowing CoB to stack with Guardian Rhythms.<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>Fufil's Curtailing Chant (level 30)<BR>Tuyen's Chant of Flame (level 38)<BR>Tuyen's Chant of Frost (level 46)<P>These three song's rock.  At almost all times I have at least two, if not all three of these songs going.  It's very nice to know that I can actually play the part of a battle bard using these three songs, and still be effective.<P>The problem arises when we get resist's.  If I'm fighting in nagafen's lair, chant of flame is out.  If I'm fighting in permafrost, chant of frost is out.  If I'm fighting in Kael Drakkal, both chant of frost and fufils chant are out (very high MR and CR), unless i'm fighting against greens, and even then they still resist extremely bad.<P>Obviously there's nothing to be done about things that are INTENDED to be cold resistant.  But how about adding in two more chants?  Tuyen's Chant of Sickness (disease based), and Tuyen's Chant of Imbalance (poison based).  This would allow a bard to have a chance to still provide a fair amount of damage, be able to increase a necromancer's usefullness by dropping disease and poison resist's for them (thereby allowing necromancer's to feel more user-friendly than they currently feel in high level encounters), and not have the problem of deciding whether to keep bard's gimped at high levels or to allow lower resist's on song's that shouldn't be useable against cold/fire/magic resistant creatures.<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>Syvelian's Anti-Magic Aria (level 40)<P>This song is capable of dispelling whoever or whatever your target is.  It works on you, people in your group, and creatures your fighting (possibly pet's as well, I haven't tried it on them)<P>It doesn't report if it is resisted or not.  When I go to the planes, currently I'm too young to be effective there doing anything but meleeing, playing resist songs, mana song, and dispelling.  When it doesn't tell me whether or not it was resisted, I have no way of knowing if it was successfull or not.<P>Suggestions for improvement:<P>Have it tell me if it's resisted<P>Inform me what buff i'm removing (this would be a nice feature, but I can see where that would be asking too much ... but still, I'll suggest it anyway, maybe the team will decide it would be a good addition).<P>Inform me if there's nothing left to be dispelled.<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>Niv's Melody of Preservation (level 47)<P>This song was gimped earlier when damage absorbtion component's were removed from Jonthan's Provocation, Melody of Preservation, March of the Wee (?), and I believe one other song, in favor of adding in level 49 Shield of Song (which has a rune component).  If your going to gimp song's, would be kinda nice if there was something added to it to make up for this, such as perhaps increasing slightly the regen on Niv's, or increasing the effectiveness of other song's in a similar manner (provocation is already pretty good.  Making it a self-only song kinda sucked, but oh well)<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>As for our skills, I think you may have missed a few things.  For our lock picking, and other similar skills which are useless to us at the level we receive them, it might be nice for the lower level bards to be able to get it at say, level's 10-15 so they might be put to good use.<P>I personally wouldn't argue with the idea of having lock pick and disarm trap's capped at say, 150, but I'm not going to hold my breath on it.<P>Also, there seems to be a bit of misunderstanding about how our song's work.  There was a problem with a higher level weapon in kunark which had the effect: Song of Dawn (unless i'm totally mistaken).<P>Everytime this effect would go off, it would interfere with song's that were currently being used.  Though this bug (according to rumor) has been fixed on that particular weapon, rumor is that this is happening again with other equipment available in velious which also uses bardic song's as an effect.  Please talk to the design team and make sure that they understand that they need to think about what their doing instead of quickly slapping an effect on an item and shipping it out the door.<P>The defense stuff that has been happening on test is kind of a nice gesture, but I don't feel it will do me any good overall.  If the bard is getting beat on enough for the defense to help, it's not going to help because the proverbial crap has already hit the fan.<P>I won't go so far as to say I don't want it, but methinks that we could benefit more from not having so much aggro propogated to us and our group via our songs.<P>Last thing, I'd really like to have something similar to a cast'ers ability to channel through a spell.  Do you know how annoying it is to have 5 orc pawn's beating on me, have one of them successfully bash me for 1 point of damage, and have my song get interrupted?  I never hear caster's complaining of this.  Why?  Because they have skills that help them prevent these interrupts.<P>You might say that bard's have the advantage of being able to move while they are 'casting', but that's really only usefull when I'm kiting.  I don't spend a lot of my time kiting, I'm in a dungeon most of my bardic life.  Because i'm in a dungeon, I don't spend all my time running around, so the argument that being able to move and cast does not properly address the problem of me getting interrupted by level 3-5 creatures when I am singing songs at level 47.<P>Anyways, I hope some of these can be added to the list.  Good day to you =)<P>-Desbarolis -- 47th bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My list of Bard Concerns...<P>***Skill Department***<P>Brass - Move from Level 11 to Level 17 (first Brass song we get) this will save newbies who dont know any better some practice points.<P>Meditate - Come on... Give this at level 1, not like putting in songs faster will affect combat ability and 1 point of meditate dont really help put songs in all that fast to begin with.<P>Sneak/Hide - Can we get this to work against live and dead creatures at the same time like rogues as we share many abilities with them and we already have an INVIS song at level 19 which makes things more or less useless. This small fix will help make these skills useful.<P>Safe Fall - Monks, Rogues and Bards all need higher skill caps in Safe Fall. Particularly Bards as we move at insane speeds when traveling (using drum) which makes those little hills do hits for like 50 damage.<P>Traps Skills - Fix these, they're useless right now.<P>Pick Lock - Needs improvement somehow or lower the skill on some of the locks in the game right now since the nerf that NPCs can just walk through doors.<P>***Song Concerns***<P>Kelin's Lugumbrious Lament (8) - Lower resistance check to that of the Lifetap/Stinging Swarm lines and this song will be fixed. Right now I only use this song for pulling if I dont want to do damage. Also change the thing from 'Soandso looks sad' to something else.<P>Cinda's Charismatic Carillion (11) - Need to fix this song. It needs to give better faction at higher levels as well as be of an unresistable type. After all if someone sings for you wont you atleast not want to kill them :P<P>Kellin's Lucid Lullaby (15) - AE MEZ song. Make it work like the mezmerize level 4 enchanter spell for purposes of resist checking in an AOE fashion. It might be a bit overpowered at the lower levels BUT as it gets higher it will come into semi-limited usefulness.<P>Tarew's Aquatic Ayre (16) - When used with insturment should GREATLY increase range.<P>Alenia's Disenchanting Melody (22) - Please fix this one its hardly ever used. I'd suggest making it a Single-Target Group-Only Song.<P>Selo's Constant Chain (23) - All movement restricting bard spells should include a decent MR debuff in it. This would help keep the song on semi-resistant creatures.<P>Angstilch's Appalling Screech (26) - Still affects PCs on PvP servers. Either make all FEAR spells work or make it nolonger affects PCs<P>Agilmente's Aria of Eagles (31) - Increase to 4 ticks and bring back the warning its about to fade. Increase range GREATLY as its often used when moving.<P>Mana Drain Songs - Need to drain more per tick, as it stands they are next to useless against PCs and NPCs.<P>Denon's Despirate Dirge (43) - 250 AE DD. Increase damage to about 500 AE DD as considering bard-restriction on mana it takes up to 1 hour to regain the mana to reuse this.<P>Song Suggestion - How about a song thats targetable and takes mana from the Bard and dumps it to the target. Should be rather low level so its actually useful. And give a 1:1 mana transfer unlike the necro version because they can get mana from medding and/or using their HP:Mana spells.<P>***Insturmental Concerns***<P>Bonuses - Bards would like to see the bonuses they get for using insturments even if you just give it a rating similar to DMG which goes from 1 to infinity (in theory)<P>Availablity - Currently the only places known that drop magical insturments are Mistmoore and Dragons/Gods. How about quests or an insturment building skill maybe with the ability for tinkering to create components for these. These built/quested insturments could have advantages to them either by being weapons themselfs or allowing a bard to use the insturment 1-handed (allowing the bard to put a weapon into their primary hand while using an insturment).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Addendum<P>Melee Ability - My suggestion is as follows... Double Attack at 30 with a cap of 150 (200 at post-50). Lower Parry to 35 and skill cap to 50 (100 at post-50). Lower Riposte to 40 and skill cap of 50 (100 at post-50)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Having played bards for a very very long time, I'd like to add my suggestions. <P>Please increase the variety / level range of magic instruments.<P>Do not increase melee abilities.  Too many bards think they are tanks with regen song.  Bards are INT / Charisma casters who happen to wear plate.  Anyhow, a smart bard who uses instruments can just about out-DoT any class in the game.<P>Allow bard haste songs to stack with haste spells.  Not all melees have haste items, and the argument that stacking bard haste songs is pointless due to haste caps assumes that the melee who is hasted has some haste item.<P>Please do not allow scripting or macroing of bard songs.  Doing this would only fuel the "melee bard" fire as bards would simply hit their "songs" macro key, and then go in and pretend they are a warrior.  Juggling songs / instruments is one of the basic aspects of playing a bard.  It would be like allowing clerics to have a "heal tank" macro that auto-heals low health tanks.<P>Please please please play test bards.  I do not believe anyone play tests bards to any significant degree.  This is evident in the recent "Selos fiasco" where any bard lvl 5 or higher would have caught that bug within 5 minutes of play time.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000665-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000665.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000665-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000665-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000665-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000665&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000665&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
