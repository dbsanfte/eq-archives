</FONT><HR>My gods, I am ADD something horrible...   Well anyways I got tired of reading somewhere through all this and will add my voice into this.<P>All voices singing in harmony perhaps will change this world!  I am a Shadow Knight, played a Ranger, and a Bard.  At one time I had a dwarf Paladin when my friend was trying to get me hooked on EQ.  It was when I found the Shadow Knight that I became addicted.  I play my SK all the time.  I have worked hard to get him to lvl 45, I have worked my ass off for everything I've gotten.  I've hunted along side every possible class in nearly every situation that I can up to this point.  I've learned where and when things happen and how to use certain skills more effectively.<P>I am saddened to say that I have also learned who takes the longest to get to set lvl.  I was hunting beside a warrior who in the next week (2 days of time played) got 6 lvls, I had attained 3.  I find my ability lacking now at 45, and am outdamaged by a lvl 35 warrior.  I use a weapon with 13 dmg per second and am out damaged by a warrior weilding a weapon with 11 dmg per second...  this is wrong.  No way in hell someone 10 lvls below me is supposed to be this much more powerful than me.  This game is not right somehow.  There must be something I missed when I created my Shadow Knight...<P>I played my Shadow Knight the first time to lvl 15, I had gotten my pets and learned how the delay worked with him.  They changed that...  So I restarted my Shadow Knight and got him to lvl 25, learning the new way dmg worked in the pets hands.  I restart then because I wish to change my starting stats a bit.  I created my current SK and knowing what I had learned from everything I got him to 30 through hard work.  I learned how feign worked to pull and other things.  I liked it, then they start messing with the way it works.  Now I can't feign pull past lvl 35 as effectively as I used to...  &lt;bows head in shame&gt;  but I learned to deal with it and changed how I pulled.  They release Kunark, I'm not the fool some of my peers were and did not run out there to buy it.  I did eventually get it but only to hunt with my friends, nothing gained post 50 was worth it to me.  In fact I watched my power be stripped from me as I grew in lvls.  Watched more and more classes out damage me, lvl 45 came around and now I realize I should have been another class.  Things have greatly become weakened since the 40's rolled around.  And although I wish to quit I will not.  I will persevere and survive, and one day my voice will be heard and this world will start to change.<P>I have played my ranger to the lvl of attaining the first realm of spells.  I've learned how to use these spells and have enjoyed him.  I deleted him to recreate him.  I have created him and started work on him but decided to get my SK up first.  I have played the bard very little but up to 8.  He has been fun but I know the lack of power they have and will not continue him until I'm done with my SK.  And even then I think I will work my Ranger first.<P>The posts here have given their thoughts and I see many things in there that make sense.  Give us the ability to cast while fighting (much like a bard can start singing while throwing some attack) and we would be fine.  I'd prefer that rather than losing my exp penalty, which I can live with.  Please though.  Do not ignore us, we have had enough of it as it.<P>Do not ignore the Bards either, they are a hybrid of a sorts and do need some help as well.<P>The more I visit these boards the more hybrid posts I see.  Our voices are starting to come together.<P>Delofasht Buranasiri<BR>Lvl 45 Knight of the Shadows<P>You cannot evade me, a_Verant_Interactive_Representitive00!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree with Pathin (sp?).  Just eliminate the hybrid experince penalty.  I don't know enough about the issues post 50, so I won't comment on them.  But the hybrid experience penalty prevents me playing my Troll Shadow Knight. (I'm not saying eliminate the racial penalty, just the class penalty.)<P>I stopped playing him at level 36 because I simply found it too hard to get in a good group and soloing was becoming more and more difficult. <BR>I've since started a Troll Warrior and in my limited time playing him, have found him to be very group "friendly", having little difficultly landing the "main tank" role.<P>Seriously, even if there was no experience penalty, certainly a warrior would be preferred as the main tank over a hybrid, as it should be.  But having an SK or Pally or Ranger as a secondary tank/puller should be more in line with "The Vision".  These classes are not getting into groups because of the known experience penalty they carry with them.<BR>  <BR>More warriors and monks are filling the roles of secondary tank/puller because it wont hurt the groups ability to level.  Other warriors and monks are just as useful in that role as the hybrids are, and depending on where/what you're hunting, perhaps more useful.<P>I honestly believe (at least pre 50), that by eliminating the experience penalty for hybrids will restore the balance and make those three classes more viable.<P>I've played quite a few different classes to a variety of levels, and feel like I've been around the block a bit:<P>47 Dark Elf Mage (retired, LD is a killer and broken past 50)<BR>40 High Elf Cleric (active, viable class)<BR>36 Shadow Knight (retired, can't get in groups, can't solo)<BR>30 Iksar Warrior (retired, no decent mid-level or high end armor available, taking a beating!)<BR>22 Gnome Warrior (more viable then the Iksar and ball to roleplay!)<BR>16 Troll Warrior (should've made this my first "tank" class)<BR>13 High Elf Enchanter (Why did I put all my creation points into Charisma again?)<BR>7 Half Elf Bard (I always wanted to run with Selo's... now I can say I can, just isn't "me")<P>I'd like to try a Paladin or a Ranger someday too.  Why?  I simply love this game.  Why won't I?  The weight of the experience "albatross" that would be hanging from my neck is more than myself or my party should have to bear.  <P>Simply put, hybrids aren't any better than monks or warriors, so they shouldn't have to pay the price.<P>Thanks..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>We can assume two things:<P>They will not take away our xp penalty.  They have said that over and over again. It would give people instant levels. <P>So what can they do?<BR>1) Make it so if we have a xp penalty, that we have something that makes it worth it.<BR>  a)Make the enhancements a more groupable, desirable character for joining groups.<P>This would include in my idea:<BR>1) Make it so more of our spells abilities are group freindly. Each one of the hybride classes are different, so this needs to be looked at separately for each one.<BR>2) We are half warrior.  We should receive some warrior like abilities.  You know the one where they don't take any damage for like 15 or 20 seconds?  How about we get one where we take half damage for 15 or twenty seconds.  We are half warrior are we not?  THe other warrior abilities could be tweaked and added in a warped hybrid form.  THey should NOT be full warrior version, but a special hybrid version which depicts the hybrid version appropriately.<BR>3) As Paladins and SK go up in level they should be able to use their ability more then once per 72 minutes.  These abilities do very little at the upper levels. A SK harm touch is not even one mage nuke.  A paladins LOH is purely a complete heal, something a cleric does several times per fight alone.  <P>Just a few ideas.  FLaMe away!!!<P>Bazralo<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OMG, Thank you for reading these posts, Alan. I had given up all hope of any improvements to hybrids long ago. Gordon just quit posting with them, and said the discussions were over. I love this game, but believe some serious errors were mad regarding hybrids. In general they are underpowered, overpenalized(including experience penalty), and should be able to be bound BY A CASTER anywhere casters can bind themselves.<P>Keep hope alive....<P>choklo 54 sk of brell</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hey Absor, can you give us a few hints as to how 'SoV' will improve the situation for hybrids?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>For instance IF we buy the new expansion will hybrids then get a set of unique spells? will hybrids get melee skills capped higher? will hybrids get a couple of disciplines? will hybrids get the necessary fixes to LoH and HT? will shadowknights get VE and drainlife spells unnerfed???<P>Perhaps I missed it but I thought SoV was just new mobs and new zones aimed for the +50 crowd?<P>Just to enlighten you, I play from Australia and currently the AUS$ against the US$ is pretty woeful. If I order SoV from Verant, then I will be paying twice as much because of the awful exchange rate. Add the horrendous shipping costs and SoV will probably end up costing me upwards of AUS$150.<P>IF hybrid fixes come readily packaged with SoV, then I will happily pay that money. If however SoV IS just another bunch of high level zones and mobs that my shadowknight has almost no chance in soloing or getting in a mob to fight there - then SoV will be very low on the buying list.<P>Cheers,<BR>Tryst, lv43 delf sk and Aussie gamer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well VI has spoken and I for one am thrilled that they at least acknowledge the problem and even go so far as to mention that there will be some changes. Hopefully they will be viable and not just "fluff" , but we'll have to wait to see. Obviously not exactly what you lvl 50+ people want to hear but for a lvl 31 sk, this is music to my ears. I have a 39 druid also and figured I'd just have to play him. At least this gives hybrids some hope and give me a reason to keep leveling my sk. I really want the lvl 52 and maybe even the lvl 58 pet =) Well time to hit CT hard and heavy now. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well I have to say I totally agree with most things about Hybrids you guys think should be done (even though personaly i would like my pally to have SoW and Ice Comet because realy Holy Might is a lvl 29 cleric spell for 60 dmg get real like anyone wastes mana on that) but I do however have a realistic idea give pally duel wield what is it pyshical imposible.  It is very important to have duel wield well yes on paper you see FA has the same damage / Delay as a pair of yaks but FA is very hard to get and because the there are 2 yaks they proc twice as much and now you see the imbalance, so verant please give us pally duel wield it would far improve our damage post 50 when duel wield is the only choice for other melee classes. <P>Solaryn, Paladin of the 45 season.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I'm still reading this discussion, for sure. But Velious will introduce some things that might solve your problems.<P>Please tell me you arent implying that i HAVE to get Velious to have my hybrid viable again.  Please tell me that this isnt gonna be some  "here; come get these items from the level 60 mob that only a guild with 300 people in it can even think of getting"<P>This would be like a major tire manufacturer saying "dear customer... the tires you have been using have been found to be defective.... for the small fee of the original price of your tires we will fix them for you"  <BR>    (tried to use an issue you Americans might relate too.... LOL)<P>I really hope this isnt the case....  because if it is.. i wont just retire my Ranger.... ill find another game....  <P>Again.... i really hope this isnt what you intend... im tired of "might" and "wait and see" and "i think you'll like" comments from Verant to be honest.  What id really like to see is an open forum where these issues can be discussed flame free, in an adult manner and preferably off these boards.  Dont say e-mail because i have receipts of 10 e-mails that i have sent to Verant that have been ignored.  If you have no plans of rectifying things.. please come out and say it...  I can live with abandoning my Ranger and the 40 days spent playing him but i cannot further abide half-truths, implications, innuendos and class comparisons anymore.  I know what ive seen and what ive seen  has been found wanting...  If i have to purchase what should have been there in my original purchase... say it now please before i waste further time.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, it's not a solution, but I think it's a clear description of the general problem.<P>Verant predicted that the hybrid classes would be more played because they can do more things (get more “toys” to play with).  For example a paladin is a warrior/cleric hybrid.  You could play a warrior, but then you wouldn’t get to do cleric things; you could make a cleric, but then you wouldn’t get to do warrior things.  From what I’ve read, that’s why hybrids have exp penalties; you get to play 2 classes at once.  (Bards are not a mixture of classes per se, but they get a lot of fun toys.)<P>Why would anyone want to play a warrior, when they can play a warrior and a cleric all at the same time?  Well, the experience penalty was added to dissuade people from playing the hybrids. By itself, this makes sense.<P>However, combine this with the idea that classes need to be balanced, and the argument falls apart IMHO. Hybrids get an ability penalty too; a paladin is not a combination of a warrior and cleric; he is a combination of a weak warrior, and a weak cleric, and can do neither job as well.<P>Hybrids get a double hit: Experience and ability.<P>Verant really needs to ask itself this: If there were no hybrid experience penalty, would everyone rush out and make hybrids? I’m sure there would be an increase in them, but, the most “powerful” classes in the game are: Warrior/Cleric/Enchanter for groups, and Necro/Druid for soloing.  <P>Hybrids are hit at higher levels, because the game is tougher at higher levels, and there is less room for unoptimal groups.  If the game is balanced, then 2 paladins would be an equal substitute for a warrior and a cleric.  Are they?<P>There is a third 3rd way hybrids are hit along with other classes.  It’s generally accepted that a core of a good high level group is a warrior/cleric/enchanter.  True, you can get by without them in certain situations, and maybe even do as well in other situations; however, these 3 classes are always desired in a group under *any* circumstance, whereas the remaining classes are desired under *certain* circumstances.<BR> <BR>I’d offer this challenge to Verant: Make an area where a Cleric/Enchanter/Warrior group would fail, and a Ranger/Paladin/SK group (or even a Shaman/Rouge/Magician group) would succeed?<P>  -  Reed Stormwind (45th level bard on E'ci)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

But Velious will introduce some things that might solve your problems. <P>(end)<P>Dear Alan,<P>First and foremost I want to say how upsetting it is to see Verant back up to it's old bag of stinky tricks. I want to tell you very clearly that these things happened in Kunark.<P>When the rangers were complaining about balance issues and began to speak with Aradune about them, Aradune said to wait till Kunark. Well, the Ranger community held back their frustration and contempt and waited.<P>When get to Kunark we were even more patient hoping for something, knowing that our future spell-line was already pathetic.<P>Ok, so we continued to wait hoping for some other changes. What we found is that we were still saddled with a bunch of second rate skill increases none of which covered the areas that needed covering, such as the defense of the ranger.<P>Time progressed and some made it to 60 in record time just to test to see if the ranger issues would be resolved. The answer was a resounding NO. They didn't change at all.<P>Rangers then began their petition of Verant to have problems resolved via patches. Nothing was forthcomming. We were told that we needed to wait till we found all our equipment. Time transpired and we were alerted to all class equipment dropping. What we found out about the ranger equipment didn't satisify us one bit, and yet still our spell line post 50 was pathetic.<P>More time progressed and we petitioned more only to get the big "IGNORE". This frustrated us to no end and ranger began to abandon their class. Some quit the game and others quit their class for another. Some of us already had several 50+ chars so it wasn't a matter of switching classes. The ranger still had problems and switching classes didn't satisfy us.<P>Much transpired between the ranger community, most of which the ranger community took as insult. We analyzed the problems that were were having and identified what the causes were. We alerted Verant only to be continuously ignored. The response from Verant was that we were being ignored because they'd heard it all before. They said they knew all the problems.<P>Our response to this was yeah, sure, just like you knew the spells were dropping at an acceptable rate, or even at all (which it turned out that they weren't dropping at all). We believe them as much as we believed that for 9 months shaman alchemy was working as intended. The list of problems continues, and we are still told over and over that we have completely explained all the problems and Verant has fixed them.<P>No, they didn't. The problems haven't been mitigated in any significant way since the rangers, around level 40-45 began having them.<P>Now, we come to your current message. It tells us that we have to wait till Velious to get the balance we should have had pre-Kunark. You are telling the ranger community, and the hybrids, that you have discovered that by giving us new weapons and equpment you can balance us. The answer is that this isn't the case. You tried it in Kunark and failed miserably.<P>I have always said that it is unfair of you to force us to buy the expansion to come closer to balance. In my opinion it is a deliberate attempt to get more money from us without really putting any effort into resolving any problems.<P>Let me put it to you clearly:<P>YOU CANNOT CREATE BALANCE WITHIN THE CLASSES BY CREATING A SMATTERING OF WEAPONS AND ARMOR IN AN EXPANSION.<P>This ideology doesn't work. It never has. It failed with Kunark and will fail with Velious.<P>It is unfair and a con job to ask us to wait when we should have had that same balance back in the 40-45 range.<P>I hope you hear me and get back to those guys and let them know that we are pretty much onto what they are trying to do and that I for one, do not like it one bit.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>RPSCuthbert,<P>I love how innocense makes you more prone to listen to propaganda.<P><BR>RPSCuthbert said:<P>People often miss this, so I'll clear it up for you. Gordon has said it before, I'll say it again... maybe you'll be more open from a fellow player. <BR>Equality and balance are different. EQ strives for balance, not equality. Just because you can't solo as a hyrbrid the same you could as say a necromancer doesn't mean you suck. It means you weren't meant to solo. Your skills are elsewhere. <P>(end)<P>Actually Verant has a big problem with confusing balance with synergy.  They don't really understand their own use of their own term: balance.<P>In order to overcome the backlash from it Verant devised a system by which they could claim that any class is balanced but one or more are at the bottom of the balance scale and one or more are at the top.<P>Synergy is where the group members compliment one another to make somethingy happen and more effectively.<P>Balance is just that, an equalization across a broad range of issues.  That's why it is called balance.<P>So, in an attempt to justify their synergy mistake the claim balance and create a scale to measure your class by.<P>Part of the problem here is that they made serious changes to the way some classes were played after a specific level and that no one in those classes were the wiser till it happened.  Some had played months, even a year or more only to find that they were not balanced.<P>So, we begin to work on how a class can be synergous to a group.  We find that the synergy can be obtained faster with other classes.  We find also that some classes hinder that synergy.  The ranger class is hindering that synergy and to some extent some of the penalties that hybrids face also hinder that synergy.<P>It isn't your fault you fell for this con job.  You are as susceptible to it as anyone is, especially when you are a youth that thinks you are an adult.  I don't want to insult people but it really seems that you fell deep into their con and didn't question it.  That happens alot with younger people who haven't yet learned to question the establishment.  Today's youth actually think they know it all.  I guess my generation felt the same way, but none of us really had the forum to influence the way you do.<P>RPSCuthbert said:<P>If you play your class well, you'll be invited into groups. I have NEVER had a group reject a hybrid because of the exp penalty. Bards are a very welcome addition to just about any group, as I'm sure we can all agree. A well played bard can fill in any role the party needs. Guess what folks? Bards have the same exp penalty as hybrids. <P>(end)<P>This is not true at all.  I have 5 level 47+ characters on my single account.  I have 4 of them over level 50.  I know this game like few others from many different angles.  I am more then a capable player in each of my classes.  In my first class, my ranger, I was one of the first to make it to 50 on my server.  I have a decent reputation on my server, within my guild, and within the zones I play in.  There are certainly many poor players but I am not one of them.<P>Even with this I still have great difficulty getting groups with my ranger.  The reason is that the ranger has some serious problems.  It isn't a matter of someone's play style or skill in the game.  This is a complex game with a ton of depth and it takes alot of time to know it from many different class perspectives.<P>Falling into the false belief that if you are a good player of your class you'll be invited is nothing but laughable.  The two aren't intertwined.<P>Think of how crowded the zones are.  Think about the make up of the zones at the high levels.  These zones and the crowded nature of it along with the limited play time of the players dictates more about who gets invited then how well they play.<P>Some classes are invited into groups regardless of their skill.  I've seen many an enchanter, warrior, bard, wizard, etc invited into groups and they definitely had little grasp on what their role was and how to do it correctly.  Hopefully they will get better, but their skill most certainly is not a determining factor, especially at high levels.  High levels being 45+ and most notably 50+.<P>RPSCuthbert said:<P>As for usefulness... rangers complain because they die a lot, yes? Wanna know why? Because they do so much *damage* that the mob gets pissed off at them. Sure, a paladin isn't going to be as useful in a group with 2 clerics and 2 warriors in it already, but what about those groups without a cleric or a tank. A SKs spells may pale compared to a necromancer, but who's to say they're useless? Often I hear how much SK pets suck. Wanna know why? If SKs could summon necro power pets, everyone would play a SK. They'd be too powerful. Doesn't mean SK pet is useless though. Think of it not as a tank (that's what you as a SK are) but more as a DoT. <P>(end)<P>This is untrue.  The ranger does not do so much damage that it causes them to get killed.  The problem has to do with a defect in the way the hate list works.<P>Here's the brief for you:  The hate list is updated on every attempt of a hit.  At about level 40 the ranger has a 40% chance of doing a quad attempt.  Note:  I said attempt, not hit.<P>What this means is that the mobs begin to hate you even if you don't do any damage.<P>Many monks and rangers, as well as rogues, have reported the same thing.  They enter a battle, do no damage and after a single attempt with all 4 misses the mobs turn on them.<P>The rangers die primarily because of this.  The fact is that they do only a marginal amount of damage with their weapons.  With the fluxblade axe, a lamentation, and FBSS along with great buffs the typical ranger still only does about 60 damage (per turn).  Other classes such as the warrior, monk, and rogue do much more damage to the mob then the ranger ever could.  Remember, the rangers are hybrids.<P>You can test this out yourself.  Take out the lamentation and the fluxblade axe and replace them with the wurmslayer and yk and you'll notice that you are not agro'd as much, even though you will have done more damage with the wurmslayer then you did with both previous weapons.<P>As well, the mobs seem to focus on the arms length melee class with the lowest defense.  It can and will, unless someone changes its hate focus on a target with a lower AC.  So, even if you do take away the faster weapons, which are the speciality of the ranger, you will still be agro'd due to the lower defense and lower HP.<P>Because the ranger has a lower AC they are constantly getting some immediate attention from the mobs.  When they begin to build up the hate due to the number of swings they make the mobs tend to stay agro and it is hard for someone, even a warrior to taun the mob off them.<P>This is all well known and established and your commentary has been heard many times and has been easily explained away.  Moreover after rereading what you wrote it reminded me of a very inexperienced person, inexperience in your knowledge of the hate list mechanics and the higher level game play.<P><BR>RPSCuthbert said:<P>Classes are balanced, and very well. Any well played class will always be welcome in my groups. The thing is, people come to the boards to complain for no other reason than they have the opportunity to complain. So and so said class X sucks, so everyone in that class comes to the boards and complains how much their class sucks when in reality, the original plaintiff didn't know the full capabilities of his/her class. <P>(end)<P>We've seen and heard this before, and if we take your previous statements and weight them and then read this one we can see that this is purely your opinion on the matter. Having an opinion and supporting your position with the kind of facts you stated earlier doesn't advance our belief that your opinion is any better then the ones that say the classes are unbalance.<P>At the high end the classes are very much out of kilter.  The classes become more unbalanced as you go up higher.  At level 50 the ranger suffers the lack of balance to a greater degree then most other classes.  When the ranger hits 54-55 they are still suffering a problem, because nothing really has changed for them.  Continuing on up to 60 the rangers continue to suffer the balance issues that were stated at level 50+.<P>The other classes themselves are also beginning to suffer some balance issues.  Some classes grow in stature and power while other classes become unnecessary.  The cleric may not like their class because they are so boring having to sit on their butts all the time, but they are a required class and thus you will see many level 60 clerics on your server, much more then any other class, with the exception of the Enchanter.  The enchanter is also a required class.<P>The warrior in the mixture is required but you can often times substitute him with an SK or Paladin, but rarely if ever with a ranger.<P>The reason is that the warrior isn't the class that does the damage to these mobs.  The mobs at the 50+ range have 15-30K hp.  A warrior does absolutely an insignificant amount of damage in relation to all those HP.  It is the wizard/magician/pet class, etc that does the damage.  The warrior because the class that taunts the mob off the casters, by first establishing melee, then taunting (using their taunt skill), to keep the mobs from turning on the casters.<P>For this reason you can substitute a paladin or an SK in the mix and get basically the same result.  You cannot however substitute the ranger, monk or rogue.  You may be able to substitute a high level monk, say 58+ but the rogue is only effective when they are stabbing from behind and their evade doesn't work if they are the only arms length melee in the group.  The ranger simply doesn't have the defense skills nor the AC to support being the sole tank against many of these mobs.<P>Oh, and I'm saying that President Clinton wears pink panties, without pants all through out the Whitehouse and I know because I said this all the people on these forums are going to believe me and are going support me without ridicule.<P>The difference between what you are saying and what reality is saying is that there is a balance issue, the rangers do have a serious problem that needs to be fixed and it has been tested, analyzed and proven endless times.<P>Now if people were to somehow photograph Clinton wearing those pink panties we might believe them, but some still wouldn't.  They may even believe that this was all an illusion and that we only think we saw it because someone said we did.  You may even say someone doctored the photo.<P>Well, we rangers aren't playing that game.  We are simply pointing out serious problems and asking for a resolution.  With your reasoning alchemy will still be a problem, spells wouldn't be dropping, magician's pets still wouldn't dual wield, and on and on and on.<P><BR>RPSCuthbert said:<P>And what it comes down to is that if the so called problems with a certain class bug you so much that you have to come to the boards and waste people's valuable time complaining, maybe you should play another class. People need to stop worrying about the so called best class and play one they enjoy.<P>(end)<P>The issue isn't one of bugs.  It is because of a failure in the design.  A mistake by the design team that they won't admit to.  Just like they failed to admit to the alchemy problem, the magician pets not dual wielding, etc or even the spell drop rate being so bad.<P>It was a conscious decision on their part to limit certain things in the game and they made a mistake by limiting it too far.  Instead of trying to resolve this they made up excuses for months just like they did with the rogues, and finally after much customer bashing the company did they begin to look at it.  They made changs and fixed the rogue class.  The issues are similar for the ranger.  They made some critical mistakes, didn't put the time into working up the issues in the proper perspective and wound up hurting the game play of some of the players.  Since they'd taken such a beating in the past on past mistakes they chose to not address this in the same way. It has nothing to do with the end game, it has nothing to do with the middle or otherwise portion of the game.  It does have to do with the problems with game design and tuning and the lack of thorough testing.<P>The testers that worked on Kunark reported to Verant that there were big problems and Verant said "Bah" to that.  Now that the gauntlett is in the player court there's no reason that the players can't stand up and fight the good fight.<P><BR>RPSCuthbert said:<P>PS Another incentive to play a "sucky" class is planar loot. You won't have to compete with 10 other players for the one piece that drops. And guess what? You *still* won't be a sucky class because classes are balanced. <BR> <BR>(end)<P>You obviously don't know the stats of the planar gear.  LOL.<P>I really should only be laughing at this.  It truly is hillarious.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>to the 14th lvl ranger.   <P>I've found that rangers ROCK up until say high 40's and need some help in the 50's.  The only thing is to pick your equipment carefully.  AC and dex are important for rangers and wis can't hurt.  The ivy armor is great for the low/mid lvl's because of the high ac.  Some classes can be a little lax in their equipment selection but for rangers you gotta know what you need.  It will make a difference.<P>jmo  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Everyone I know in game agrees that rangers are weak and have issues. Everyone we have ever heard from Verant agrees with that. And yet, month after month nothing happens and we are told to wait and "keep the faith". <P>FUN does not equal having an entire zone laugh at you. <P>FUN does not equal having your group spend the entire night telling you that you suck.<P>FUN does not equal having people tell you to your face that they dont group with "EXP SUCKING HYBRID GIMPS". <P>FUN does not equal being told you are not required on raids because you have nothing to offer. <P>FUN does not equal being the clearly perceived weakest class in the game across the board. <P>We know the class has issues. You know the class has issues. Why would you tell us to wait ?<P>We have kept the faith. We have soldiered on while Verant stuffed up archery, twiddled with Jolt, mucked about with Dodge/Parry. We took on the burden of being the only class with Druids who have to share a FA quest step. We didn't mind that we are the only melee class that can't quest for a 40% Sky Haste belt. We continued on when you gave warriors spells via their Kunark armour giving the 100% new functionality then gave us armour that cast low level versions of spells we already had that didn't stack with our high level versions. We waited while you said you would fix Sky and we are still waiting. We gritted our teeth when nobody wanted any rangers for the Test of Tactics. We survive as our numbers dwindle daily, the stats on the new server speak for themselves. <P>I am glad that Verant is busy with Velious. But, I don't see why that equates to a continued fob off of the issues of hybrids in this game. Why won't you tell us what you are planning ? Is it because you don't know ? Or are you just going out of your way to be mean ?

</FONT><HR>Alan,<P>Thank you for the reply.  I am curious of these things of which you speak.  How long till we see? I HOPE it isn't a matter of equipment solving all (though some good 1h and shields for Pal/SKs would help).<P>Everyone else,<P>Ok, cut the guy a little slack.  So far he has been straightforward with us.  We should take him at his word for now.<P>What we (paladins) DO NOT NEED is more cleric spells.  Clerics already get group heroism, I DO NOT want the group version of a lesser buff.  Instead give us some less powerful buffs ac, ac-hp, hp, atk that stack with the cleric ones.  Give us better armor, a couple discipline like effects.  Maybe a few skill points.  But if equipment is added the skill point question can be avoided.<P>In reply to a latter post:<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;The warrior in the mixture is required but you can often times substitute him with an SK or Paladin, but rarely if ever with a ranger.<P>The reason is that the warrior isn't the class that does the damage to these mobs.

</FONT><HR>I played my Ranger to Level 53. I wanted to join a guild that was interested in the tackling some of the big mobs in the game. However, I was rejected because I was an unwanted class. If I was a warrior, I would have been accepted. For that reason I made a mage, who is now level 51. I had no trouble getting into groups, or getting into the type of guild I wanted to.<P>Look at what classes are being consistantly played at 51+. The number of hybrids is dwindling. Check out the number of newly made characters. The number of hybrids is dwindling. Ask any player with a character level 51+ and ask them what the next character is that they will make. Odds are extreemely low it will be a hybrid. People are catching on to Verant not wanting people to play hybrids, and a low percentage of people are actually playing them. Most of the people that play hybrids now either are newbies and don't know better, or are people who are emotionally attatched to their character and are stubborn enough to still play it.<P>I am thinking the reason there was an exp penalty for hybrids was to have other people play other classes. Warriors were actually worse than Rangers when the game was released. Slowly, warriors have been upgraded to be viable, but in the process Rangers have been diminshed. At the very least the exp penalty must be removed. You don't have to give me all the levels I would have gained without the exp penalty, just remove the penalty.<P>Now I understand that some consider this class envy. Is it class envy to want to be equally (or close to equally) considered for a group? Right now you can get into groups as a Hybrid if you have a really good reputation or there isn't anything better around. To get in a group as a warrior you just have to not be a complete moron.<P>To be valuable to a group in a high level encounter you have to be able to do damage (Melee or Spells), reduce damage (buffs and debuffs) or reverse damage done to you or your group (Heals). You have to be able to do one of these things with a good level of efficency, without damaging other members efficency. Less efficency means the need for more people, which reduces the odds per person to get the loot they want, and increases the odds of people going link-dead. A hybrid has less ac (takes more damage per hit) and has less hit points. Because complete heal is the most effiecent form of healing, the ideal is to use warriors for fighting and clerics for healing. Rogues and monks do alot of damage, more than a warrior. Wizards do great amounts of damage with their low resisted spells. Mages and Druids have good DDs. Mages and necros have pets that can do a significant amount of damage. Shamen, Druids, Clerics have good buffs. Bards have resist songs that make them a necessity for some high level raids. Enchanters and Shamen have haste and debuff spells. Enchanters have clarity. Where do hybrids fit in here? Can anyone thing of a raid situation where someone would say, "We would have made it if we only had one more Ranger?"<P>Hybrids are better for six man groups, when there isn't anyone better to fill the tank spot. Once upon a time (before Kunark) the role of a Ranger was to do alot of damage (compared to some other melee classes), taunt the mob off other classes, and pull in outdoor zones. Now all those things can be done better by other classes. What I would like to see is a reason people would think it was cool to have a Hybrid in their group, rather than something to be endured.<P>I have given up on Verant making my Ranger viable. I will play him once in a while for kicks, but I will probably not play him that much unless things change, and they probably won't.<P>Garton, Level 53 Ranger<BR>Tepid, Level 51 Mage<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/028487-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/028487.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/028487-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/028487-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/028487-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/028487-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=028487&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=028487&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
