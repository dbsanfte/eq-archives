</FONT><HR>Okay, up front let me say I am a mere lvl 20 chanter and proud to be it.  I've read all your comments with much interest and thought I'd weigh in here.<P>Yes, I have struggled to get to my level and will continue to do so no doubt... blah, blah, blah... that is not my point.<P>My chanter is my main and I also have a ranger and a shaman operating (both quite low at this stage)... my point is, we ALL choose the character we play... I'm not going to whinge about how hard it is to play a chanter, I can always hit the delete button but I just want you to know that my life as a chanter is nothing without a group.  I can live without almost any other class but I NEED A TANK TO SURVIVE!<P>Mezzing and stunning all day won't gain me xp.  Slowing and buffing and mana regen also won't gain me xp... what I need is a tank that will hit the damn mob and kill it... that's where my xp comes from.<P>And my job in helping to get that xp is to support the tank in his/her endeavours.  If that means keeping a mob off for a minute while he/she takes out another one.. or giving him/her a little burst of speed or the mob a debuff... then that's the only contribution I can make to a fight.<P>I'm not complaining... I have an enormous amount of respect for the damage dealers (let's face it, our damage is pretty pathetic, at least at my level)... you might believe tanks are too weak or chanters too strong but the bottom line is WE NEED EACH OTHER in order to survive and prosper.<P>Improvements are fine and the harder a tank hits the happier me and my mana will be.  Why can't we all just respect each class's strengths and weaknesses and get on with the killing  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>   Honestly, I hate grouping with Enchanters and Clerics.  Why?  Because they are a huge drain on a party's offensive might.<P>   And offensive might is what generates xp- how fast you can kill mobs.<P>   Try this: take your local xp group and replace your Cleric and Enchanter with a Bard and a Shaman.  I can virtually guarantee that you'll earn more xp, in a shorter period of time.  No, you won't be able to keep 12 mobs controlled at once.  But you won't need to, with the precise pulling abilities of the Bard.  No, you won't be able to cast Complete Heal on the tank.  But you won't need to, since he'll be healing 60+ hp/tick, and fighting a mob that swings once every other combat round.<P>   Are Enchanters useful?  Sure.  Are the irreplaceable?  Only for bad players.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm not convinced. I don't see how having a shaman/bard increases a group's offensive capabilities compared to an enchanter/cleric, I don't see how players are going to be regenerating 60 hp/tick, and if bards could single pull every time then why does everyone think monks are the best pullers and even they often have bring back multiples.<P>And, most of all, I don't see how a shaman who is also casting both haste AND slow has the mana to match the healing abilities of the cleric, even with the bard singing a heal song.<P>Arlina</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Twipple is right!<BR>And because he is right I played an enchanter twink to lvl 60!<BR>Groups are worth crap without a chanter outside Velious. You cannot even leave zone-in muahahahaa.<P>The whole game has a problem. Nobody can be allowed to solo a mob. So you need big groups to kill a single critter and even bigger groups to kill more of them. Basically every player could be made strong enough to kill green trash, but then lowbies would group with such high levels and there we go again. Same with class ballance. One class is too weak, so they buff this class, suddenly the next weakest class becomes too weak and they need to buff them too....etc...etc.<P>I think Velious screwed chanters hard, so the 'old' days will have a comeback. They improved shaman/druid healing, so groups should be able to deal with tougher mobs. The enchanter plaque is pretty much over when you play in Velious. I remember doing Tower of Frozen Shadows with my druid twink and some old school players. We parked mobs with root...just like we did two years ago...was GREAT FUN.<P>Shandrax Illuminis (60 enc Xegony)<BR>Neric Soulstalker (57 nec Xegony)<BR>Selias Evenstar (50 dru Xegony)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Twipple,<P>I am not even going to justify any of the BS you are trying to pull here. MAINLY the most important factor you are missing (which blows my mind for someone who CLAIMS to be mathematical and scientific) you cannot, I repeat, cannot draw any type of logical conclusion without first examining ALL aspects of the problem/calculation. Anyone who has majored in the sciences will tell you this. Since you have NEVER played and Enchanter post 50 all your points are completely invalid and pointless, so basically you are talking out your a$$ and obviously have class envy. <P>Also you are a coward as you have not stated your char name and server, for obvious reasons because if you were on my server I wouldn’t give you the time of day. You want to see an Enchanter leave a group on a whim, you join the group and I am gone! Since VI has been ignoring our critical issues from DAY ONE and we as a class have some very serious issues, its no-minds like yourself that post BS to get us nerfed when VIs is already clueless about the enchanter class and its needs.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Right on the money.  I have played a wizard and a enchanter.  Wizard is a complete joke.  Enchanter will be grabbed in a heart beat if looking for a group...wizard only if you need to go somewhere and then see ya.  I would welcome a challenge to this on fennin ro 100p bet that I can get far more responses for a group in any 29+ zone as an enchanter than a wizard.  Sometimes simple reality<BR>can be found through a single shout.  Try it sometime I have, and all your somantics and comparisons mean nothing if you can't get in a group.  Should we weaken any class? no!!!! Just improve the ones that are lagging.  But to say enchanters and Clerics are not the most important<BR>to a plane run is wrong and an out in out lie.<BR>Try and keep a mob at bay without an enchanter and<BR>then one with it.  Been there as the enchanter and other classes, give me the enchanter everytime.  The solution is not to weaken the enchanter, power up the nukes and the tanks.<BR>Remember its us against the mob quit cutting each others throats or you will be *****ing how much more important the cleric is cause you are dead.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>While there were some statistics mentioned, the general argument here is rediculous. The problem of relying on the tanks to do the damage instead of a caster is why this system is so messed up. Damage should be done by the casters, tanks are there for one thing, tanking, absorbing damage. Enchanters fulfill their roll by keeping the tanks alive. The element missing is the dmg dealing casters. When they are balanced back into the fight. Fights would no longer take so long. This will make the enchanter's job easier and overall balance the game back the way it should be instead of a cleric/tank/enchanter game. I play a wizard level 52 and pre-50 things were not that bad, groups worked well because of the relative way mobs were compaired to pcs. With the introduction of the new worlds and the raise on mob hps, this balanced shifted away from us wizards. I grouped with a enchanter for 20 levels when I first started out. They have it really tough, their spells get resisted alot more, so everytime they cast they have to tashan. They NEED breeze/clarity because they can't take down a mob without running out of mana. You tanks complain, but I know for a fact warriors can solo with BRONZE armor only til level 30. Enchanters have a harder time with that. Ive see a warrior take down a red mob with only 50% of his health at the start of a fight. This is WITH that bronze armor. Enchanters used to breath a sigh of relief at level 32 cause they are finally needed in groups for clarity. Before then they were hardly ever asked. This has been partially resolved by breeze. I don't have a post 50 enchanter so I can't know the enchanter intimately but I have played along side them and seen their own set of problems. Truth is, asking them to be nerfed is rediculous. They already have some issues that need to be fixed. They don't need more nerfs.<P>Korin MoonDragn<BR>Tarew Marr<P>53 Wizard<BR>34 Enchanter<BR>35 Cleric<BR>19 Druid<BR>12 Ranger<BR>12 Paladin<BR>12 Shaman<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OMG, you mean after lvl 50 we are finally a desirable (and needed) class  (aside from sitting in the newbie area casting buffs)? Tell us Twipple (sp??) did you totally snub those dreaded enchanters until lvl 50+ so that the few who did stick it out no longer want to group with you? <P>Having only been at this game since right before X-mas, with only 2 chars to my name, a lvl 21 ench and 18 warrior, I  can tell you who is the more useful, welcome addition to the group  (and who has had more invites).  Not having reached level 50, I cannot verify or deny what Twippy claims about tanks (warriors?) being less powerful.  But, should he turn out to be correct, where is the unfairness of a chanter having to really work hard through 50 levels to finally having some equal bearing in a group??  They HAVE earned it! <P>What you are propsing will take away a bit of what makes EQ fun (as opposed to the single player, more linear RPGs), and that is the diversity of race/class/religion combinations and how you chose to play them.  <P>If you don't happen to get your way, and we do survive being nerf'd, next time you may want to treat those chanters with a little respect (and maybe and occasional hug, let us know we are loved until we reach lvl 50).<P>Nindayru, Level 21 Enchantress (sticking it out until I am nerf'd...sniff)<P>Tholuxe Paells<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

You have some real problems, twipple.<BR>I love enchanters.  never played on past lvl 10, but they are great additions to the group.  I do not see many abusing their powers, causing group to give up camps on a whim.  And there is a bit of hunting that you can do at high levels without a chanter.  Stop being a pain, and bashing other classes.

</FONT><HR>(Sigh) I do wonder why we bother responding to this idiot.  Maybe we just enjoy talking to each other, and Twaddle just gave us a forum.<P>I have three characters - a level 16 bard with 5 days played, a level 25 wizard with 14 days played, and a level 45 enchanter with 76 days played.  Hm....  guess who took the most effort to level up?  I do agree that bards take a good bit of work to play, and that wizards take good tactics, good timing and great luck; but for my money the Enchanter is the most challenging to play *well*.  <P>Any moron can join a group, cast buffs and then nuke the target off the warriors on to him/herself and then tell the group they have to take a medd break.  That's not playing a chanter well, it's playing a suicidal Pez dispenser.  (I don't think I've loaded a DD in six or eight levels, except to blast a few Freeport rats to try it out.)  <P>The enchanter who buffs/ debuffs/ stuns/ mezzes/ watches for adds/ drops a Rune on the cleric getting pounded/ drops Memblur on the mob pounding the cleric/ casts invis or IVU on the puller /pulls /jewels with dropped gems /etc /etc /etc...  yes, I suppose those enchanters ARE gods of combat.  But did you notice that we WORK for it?  A bit more tricky than hitting Auto and then Kick and Taunt once in a while.<P>I'll agree with Twaddle on one point - that a good enchanter makes a group and a bad enchanter can destroy one.  But the answer to Twaddle's statement that you can't have a raid without a proportionate number of enchanters (and clerics) isn't to make enchanters or clerics less effective, or you'll not have any raids at all.  (Seems obvious, but T needs the obvious pointed out to him.)  It's to learn to work with each other more effectively.<P>SoulFrost DeDanaan<BR>45th Enchanter<BR>Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Twipple. You say you need an enchanter to do Karnors? I say you need to work on your skills. It's quite possible to do areas like the Hands or Warlord room without an enchanter.

</FONT><HR>Hail a class_envy_post_(lost count around the billions).<P>When will people learn, the route to trying to get VI to improve your class should never include saying that another class is overpowered.<BR>Don't believe me ? Ask people who have played Necros before and after the many nerfs that have been applied. Even now VI turn around and tell them that the price they are paying for be able to solo to high levels is a lack of use on big raids.<BR>So, basically, they are saying that Necros shouldn't bother buying Vellious....<P>Now, about Enchanters being over-powered.<BR>When you have people who are sloppy in their approach to playing the game, then Enchanters can help paper over the cracks. <BR>They can make bad players into average players.<BR>*Good* Enchanters  can allow groups to survive when they shouldn't, either because of player error or because of bad programming.<BR>It's still possible that one mistake by a player can kill a raid in a second it's just that Enchanters, along with many other classes, can reduce this likelihood.<BR>Using the example of pulling a casting mob and not being able to root park it - *** were you doing then ? Your group should know to switch to the casting mob and root park the mob they were on. This is simple EQ tactics - perhaps you should learn some ?<P>I've seen PoG done with bards kiting in place of Enchanters mezzing. Using the excuse that you can't do something *because* you didn't have an Enchanter is not the classes' fault - it's down to your lack of skill =/.<P>"Hey - that bloke can program a computer and earn more money than me - nerf him."<BR>"But who's going to program the computer ?"<BR>"If the computer is too hard to program without the skills he has - then the way the computer operates obviously needs to be changed."<BR>Ummmmm, hello ?<P>Now - if you're saying that Enchanters should have their overall power reduced, then please realize the effect it will have in the long run.<BR>Make no mistake - this *is* what you're asking for, you may pretty it up and say that you're actually asking for Tanks to be upgraded, but that's not what is going to happen.<BR>VI learnt a long time ago that it is much easier to nerf one class and listen to them whine, then it is to improve one class and listen to all the others whine. <BR>Simply put - it's easier to damage control 7% of the customers than 93%.<P>FYI - the reason why Warriors, Clerics and Rogues were hit with the nerf stick recently was because FoH managed to partialy break Sleeper's Tomb (supposedly *the* toughest zone in the game) with groups made up mostly with the above classes. I suggest you check the MR of the high level mobs - even Necros can't get taps off against some of them, so what chance do Enchanters have to mez them ? To take down some of these mobs you *need* to know what you can handle before you attempt it, if the Enchanter is not sure you they can mez the mob, then you dont attempt it - or you change tactics to exclude the necessity of the Enchanter.<P><BR>Eveel.<BR>52nd Necro.<BR>Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Twipple:<P>Wow 141 posts at the time I last checked, you started quite the thread here, here's my reply.<P>Enchanters are a group oriented class.  With the Kite/dot nerf that took place I can't remember how long ago, the only way for a chanter to effectively solo was taken away.  Chanters can't survive very long without a group (in my experience), but when we do group, we're DAMN good at it!  '<P>I don't know why but somehow I got the tone from your initial post that you were a necro, I could be completely off.  However as an example, Necros are probably THE BEST soloing class in the game, they are the Anti-Chanter.  Their abilities do little for a group (other than as a mana battery), and work much better for longer drawn out solo encounters.  On the other hand chanters, the Anti-Necro, work horribly when soloing.  The pet can only stand a couple hits, the DDs are slow recycling and their crowdcontrol line's are useless.<P>I've been grouping with a druid over the past week or so.  Everytime I log on my druid partener has gained another level over me.  Why?  Because when I log off, he can continue playing at nearly the same effectiveness (less efficiently), than when i'm on.  When he logs for the night, I'm basically left in the dark and go persue my jewelcraft cause I can't kill this stuff solo.  He's now starting to break the 4 lvl limit and has to disband and powerlevel me those few more bars to keep me in range to group.<P>I guess what I'm doing here is saying that everyone has their place.  Recently a very large part of discussion has been about certain high level classes, (necros, druids), having no place in group raids, or fairly monotonous ones.  Enchanters are THE group class, and for that they pay dearly by being as reliant on a group as the group is on them.<P>I think you can see where I'm going i've repeated it a few times over so instead of explaining it any further I'll let your self-proclaimed brilliance extrapolate the rest.<P>***!<P>Yeah I do play a chanter, but I've also played nearly every other class in the game...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000604-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000604.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000604-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000604-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000604&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000604&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
