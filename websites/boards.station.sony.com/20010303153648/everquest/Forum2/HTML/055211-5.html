</FONT><HR>Ranger Ability?<P>How about a skill called "Ranger Agility"  a short term boost that is skill based(goes up with lvl), that does gives a Temporary boost to Defense, Dodge, Ripostle, parry, a percent modifier to dmg taken(to basically take less dmg, instead of increased hp's), and a Percent penalty to attack(to offset the benifits in Defense).<P>This would do two things.  One it would allow the other classes to be able to out taunt the ranger, With the ranger doing less dmg while the skill is active.  Two it would allow the Ranger to Survive a little better while the Mog is beating on the Ranger.<P>Thanks, </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

But I'm gonna beat the dead-horse drum anyway 'cause I'm mad (mostly at myself).<P>Wizard just fouled up and got himself agroed.  I fouled up and healed and got myself mega agroed.  Ranger just came and saved my behind.  And got thrashed four zones away for his trouble.  (nothing sadder than a cleric who fizzles 6 times in a row)<P>Sure I gave him the best exp rez I could but groups don't always have a cleric available and SoW or not, 4 zones is a long way.  <P>Lacking a once-a-day class-spell like HT/LoH, give Rangers a Natutre-bind.  They're forever saving people because they can climb the hate list like mad when they want to.  And they have a propensity to get squashed too 'cause they can't get off it.<P>Ok, got it off my chest now.

</FONT><HR>Here is a summation of the balance issue, using 50+ hybrids as the model.<P>Defense skill grants 3 numeric AC per point.  Offense grants 1 numeric ATTK per point and weapon skill grants 2.  Therefore, a single point of defense is equivalent to a point of offense & weaponskill.<P>If a Knight has 252 Defense and 230 Offense and Weaponskill, he will gain 156pts of AC and 90pts of ATTK.<P>If a Ranger has 200 Defense and 252 Offense and Weaponskill, he will gain 0pts of AC and 156pts of ATTK.<P>The Ranger does have higher Double Attack and Duel Wield skills, which reflect higher damage dealing but it is my understanding that this is balanced by lower AC armors and HP totals resembling MNK and ROG class.  Correspondingly, the Knight's lower damage potential is balanced by higher AC and greater HP pools.<P>The disparity between Hybrid Offense/Defense numeric values is not addressed properly.  Rangers have a deficit of 90 numeric AC/ATTK points.  This can be addressed by either adjusting the Defense skill to make up the defecit, or since the weapon/offense skills are maxxed, the difference may be made up in Duel Wield and Double Attack skills.<P>Spells:<P>Ensnare 51st - This spell fizzles way too much.  When I was 50th, my 9th level snare fizzled once a month with low wisdom;  it was rock solid reliable, as a spell of this nature should be.  Today at 60th, with 130+ wis this spell still fizzles up to 40% of the time.  This is unacceptable.<P>Drones of Doom 54th - This spell is hideously underpowered for the level.  The 341 damage it applies over its duration is under 10% of my melee damage potential.  The casting time, mediocre mana ratio and difficulty of mastering conjuration make this spell a white elephant in the ranger repetoire.  This spell should have been Drifting Death at 59 and Skin Like Nature at 54th instead of Skin Like Diamond.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>well I like a lot of the things I have seen here.  I will say I have not read all the posts way to many of them right now wich shows how much we care about our class.  I am only going to bring up one issue right now and its not a huge thing just something that has confused me for a long time.  Rangers get sneak and hide yet we cannot use them in conjunction with eachother.  Hide drops when we move, thus we loose the possibility of  very potent ability.  Why could sneak/hide not be made to work together outdoor only (as the rogues can do anywhere) and still with no message on if it worked (as it is now).  I know some people will think I am stepping on the rogues toes here but rangers have had all of there skills stepped on and this is not a class envy post...we have the skills they just dont WORK!  Kill disarm and give us the ability to sneak/hide outdoor only...it would make us more desirable in some situations and allow us to be of more use in say fear....anyhow I am a woodsman by name I should be able to move in the woods without being noticed if I so choose (that is unless the RPG definition of ranger has been changed by the Vision?).<P>Now for my heartfelt thanks to the design team...the changes on test will help the new and mid lvl rangers TONS....good work.  Higher lvl rangers get some new candy but they could use a little bit more work...biggest issue would be more hitpoints...I would even be willing to ask for a increase to half of what the other hybrids got...it still equals more hitpoints.  <P>Also gates? WHAT we are a walking class part druid or no.  I think that gates are out of line for our class.  I would rather see more hitpoints, sneak/hide functional, and maybe, just maybe a few more bows and armor choices...all be it a lot of places havnt been tapped in velious so i wont go and say stuff doesnt drop...why shold we have drops in PoG..its our home plane for tunares sake.  I wont kill tunares beasts to get items (and no I am NOT a hardcore roleplayer but I am to a point).  I figure the ranger stuff will come in PoM.  Ok I think I have babbled enough.

</FONT><HR>Well, I have something I'd like to say:<P>1) All the changes I see done or possibly being done are good. They are needed, wanted and welcomed.<P>2) Verant obviously wants Rangers to be Offense and not nessecarily "Tanks", so... why not re-vamp Archery and make it useful? We've been asking for this for sometime now and the common response has been "not in Vision" or "its just NOT gonna happen". Well, a TON of things just happened that were "Never" gonna happen, so why not reconsider this?<P>The book on Bowering mentions Ceramic and Steel Bows, yet they aren't in the game. Any bow WORTH having takes an act of the Gods to get. The Bows are all pretty slow with one or 2 exceptions and those are TERRIBLY hard to get. However, Ranger's are supposed to be the Archers Extrodinaire so why not let us be???<P>Leave the defense cap down, since you seem so determained to do so. But give us Archery the way it OUGHT to be and not how you THINK it should be. Archery was made, in real life, to be a VERY SERIOUS OFFENSE yet VERY DIFFICULT IN SKILL.<P>All I ask is that you do that. Make it like THAT.<P>That's all. Thanks.<P>PS: All you people saying "Hybrids get it, why not us?" Just remember the exp penalty we've suffered through for the last XX levels.<P>I have NO doubt all classes will be re-examined. But don't look at what is being down to Hybrids as favoritism. Its not. Its correction to the way things should be. You can believe it or not, but its the truth.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just a few requests here:<P>1. Raise our defense above a shaman/clerics. Really doesn't make any sense. Or at the least up our dodge/riposite skills. <P>2. Lower Jolt to 49. That is where the problems tend to start now. Thats the level people start to take on the bigger mobs in Kunark. Having it at 55 doesn't help much, if at all.<P>3. Trueshot should be a truely high damage /disc. Very insane bows like the Windsaber should do *insane* damage. This was nerfed and now the higher damage/slow bows do the most .. Kinda whacked... It seemed like it was working perfect before the very first adjustment. People looked forward to lining rangers up along a wall to arrow an uber mob down. This *was* very unique, and really made the end game mobs a lot more interesting to take out.<P>4. Make our spells stack. I honestly can't cast Call of Earth, one of the best spells you've given us on ANYONE.. Where ever I go, everyone is hasted with the aug or the monks have their celestial fists.. I can't cast it on anything.. Drives me nuts having such a potentially awesome spell that doesnt stack.. Same with Strength of Nature.. Such a great spell but overwrites firefist and a few other spells.. Just make the spells all stack nicely PLEASE.<P>PS. I love the changes on test. But it's still a FAR cry of getting us wanted in groups. We're still looked down upon as a last resort for pickup groups.. This game is about grouping, make us viable. That's where the balance is. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Great suggestions, and I agree with most.  <P>AC/HP:  I do not want to see warriors thinking that hybrids will replace them as pure tanks, that will never happen.  However, even though more AC and HP will make us more Warrior-ish, that is what we mainly need.  For reference, I have 1500hps at level 51 (1314 base, 186 equip) and 1675 self buffed.<P>Defense:  Raise it.<P>Offense:  Never had a problem with it, especially since we got Str of Nature.<P>Taunt:  I like it.  Gives me a chance to pull MOBS off of the casters.  Using a 2-hander with a 41 delay (about 30ish in reality with a CoF) I don't have a problem taunting too much.  But just to be safe make jolt available at a lower level, say 51  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Spells:  <P> - In general, in the time it takes to cast any melee spells I could have hit twice for a total of about 140 to 180 on average.  So unless the damage is increased or the casting time lowered my offensive spells really are just a gimmick.  Sure I could miss, but my spells could be interrupted or resisted (especially the firebased ones).<P> - Mana in general goes to fast also.  My wisdom is 103, not bad for a Ranger, but not enough considering if I buff my group with Str of Nature, a damage shield, and maybe a few others I am OOM.  Give us more decent wisdom enhancing items.<P> - Panic Animal - Why?  Everyone hear says we don't want it or need it.<P> - SOW - Keep at 39<P> - Jolt - Lower to 49-51<P> - Heals - By the time we get them they are of little value (maybe reduce down time a bit).  Let us have them sooner, like Greater Heal at 51 (again my current level  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> )<P> - AOEs - We have none, don't really know if we need one though, just throwing this out there.<P> - Ensnare - Make it worth the extra mana over snare.  As is stands I don't see much of a difference in resisits, only more fizles when using ensnare.  Duration does not mean crap if you don't snare until the fight is close to being over.<P>Stats:  Do they actually mean anything?<P>Archery:  <P> - Forget double damage when not snared/rooted/moving, give us double damage all the time.<P> - Double attack.<P> - Increased damage and minimum damage.  I didn't max my skill and get a Raincaller do do 1 damage with arrows that cost a few plat to make (if I hit).<P> - Target is too high above/below.  What?  I can't shoot something on a 15 degree incline?<P> - Raincaller - 6 str and dex are great, but make this a bit more class defining.  Since many people only shoot once to pull this does not make this bow that much better than a warrior with a Spectral Bow (19 damage, +3 dex).  I like the 25/40 suggestion.<P>Epic Quest:  Fine as is<P>AC/HP:  More, especially HP<P>HP:  More please<P>Arkus<BR>51 Ranger of Xegony<P>P.S. More HP<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The changes to ranger offensives skills is just plain ignorant.  I don't mean to be offensive but I cannot help but point out the bitter truth.<P>There isn't any rational that can explain why we would want to do MORE "front line melee damage", because frankly we CAN NOT.  <P>I would like for someone to explain to me how raising our offense and weapons skills balances anything when the problem that we face now is that we inccur too much damage as it is due to Aggro issues.  Raising our offensive capabilities will serve no purpose but to extend the amount of time my attack button stays inactive to loose a MOBs attention.<P>Jolt is worthless due to high magic resistance on a majority of MOBs, the added aggro that accompanies a resisted spell, and the amount of mana required to cast it.  The only fix I can think of for this spell is to make it unresistable, otherwise it should be removed and replaced with Evade.  Or we could just chalk it up as another useless Ranger "skill"  (i.e. Disarm).<P>As for a class match up I think that most classes really can't be compared to one another because their rolls are so diverse.  However, hybrid classes, while diverse in their individual skills, should be more or less mirror eachother's combat skills.  Where we lack in Defense they should lack in Offense, and visa versa.  Sadly this is not the case, and to further IMBALANCE this Rangers are also faced with lower total Hit Points.<P>High Offense=Lower HP+Lower Defense+Lower Pary/Dodge/Repose??  <P>Not to sound snide but how can you conceive this farce to be balanced?  You want to add our spells into this?  Well keep in mind I'm comparing Hybrids, they ALL have spells.<P>There are a host of issues that need attention and my fellow Rangers have brought up such as TRACKING, Archery/Trueshot, Thorny Vine Armor drop rate(good lord why is it SO low? I spent 6 FULL spawn/kill cycles in Fear and saw 3 items drop off the Tentical Tormentors, one of which was a DRUID belt!  Then take a trip to Hate and in ONE spawn see almost a full set of Rogue and Cleric armor drop.), lack of cold based spells, POINTLESS spells on Tolans armor...etc.  While alot of these I would like to see addressed, I don't believe they constitute a part of our class balancing.  We ARE NOT casters, while we can do SOME damage via spells, our main mode of combat is melee.  <P>I don't demand any changes, but I would very much like to see that we be able to actually USE the proposed skill increases to our offense.  Otherwise its just a tease... " well the good news  General is that we've created a ray gun that can completely wipe out the enemy...the bad news is that it kills all of us too"   <P>/sigh</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi Absor,<P>Thank you for taking the time to really want to balance the classes and make the game enjoyable for everyone.<P>Here are ideas both roleplaying and mechanical that would help make the rangers more balanced, happier and in some cases more needed in a group.<P>1. Please fix archery:  <BR>a. It would be great if /Trueshot could be brought back to at the least pre-patch levels but use the damage of the bow.  What I would truly like to see is that a ranger with a very good bow (DN bows for example) should be able to use his Trueshot every hour for 2 minutes and the damage from any crits with that bow should be comparable to the Bsing of a rogue with epic.  Also this /disc should have more frequent crits and not miss so often.<BR>b. Increase in our archery skill by a modest amount<BR>c. Fix it so that small objects in front of the target don’t prevent us from hitting the target.  (For example: a dead gnome lying on the ground between me and Zlandicar or another dragon should not prevent my arrows from hitting the dragon).<BR>d. Please fix the elevation problems.<P>2. More DR and PR on our quest and class armor please.  As rangers are outdoorsy and hearty folk we should rarely get sick.  Okay now for the real reason (grin).  During big mob fights we must switch out what meager AC gear we have for our resist gear making us even that much more fragile and less welcome on these high level events.<P>3. If the Vision™ sees us as being lightly armored, high damaging, agile and hearty woodsmen(women) then please consider the following changes:<BR>a. Slight increase to our offense <BR>b. More Stamina or more stamina in our items and armor (i.e. the hearty woodsman folk)<BR>c. Some way to evade our ememies (as we wear light weight low AC chain armor)<BR>d. Grant us a major increase in Riposte so that we can parry our foes attack and riposted our blades into them.  Plus such an attack is much easier to do when duel wielding<BR>e. Allow the hearty barbarian folk to learn our woodland ways and become our brother rangers<P>4. Increase the drops on the call of fire (SoV) 55 spell.  Think only 1 ranger on our server has it.  Just way too rare.<P>5. Create Special bags just for foraged items.   I see this as needed because there are just so many items that can be foraged.  I’m often having to move foraged stuff to a mule character.  These could be 20 slot bags that hold small foraged items only.<P>6. Implement natural healing abilities for Rangers.  This would be similar to alchemy in which we mix roots, herbs, plants other foraged stuff into a healing balm that could have healing and/or regenerative properties.  Maybe like a poor mans version of Celestial Elixer.  Say 500pt heal over 2 min.  No stacking issues.<P>7. Make Call of Sky stackable with the enchanter Boon of Garou.  It stacks nicely with Avatar so don’t see the issue with it not stacking with Boon.  <P>8. Also please fix the stacking issues related to Strength of Nature and Call of Earth.  These buffs become useless to ourselves and to our group when in high level groups.<P>9. Would like to see a way for us woodland types to get around easier.  Druids can port all over.  As we are part druid I would like to see some self only, ranger only port spells.  Perhaps letting rangers port themselves to a place in wooded areas like:  Kithicor Woods, Surefall Glade, Greater Faydark, Warslike Woods, Emerald Jungle, Wakening Land (but not near Wuoshi please (grin)).<P>10. Make Jolt less resistible and perhaps lower the mana cost as using this up to 10 times per mob just to get it to stick can burn a lot of mana and after 5 or 6 mobs we are close to oom.<P>11. Increase the drop rate of Thorny Vine in Plane of Fear.  Been on over 20 raids to PoF and have yet to see a breastplate drop.  Not complaining for myself as I have better gear but still something I’ve noticed.<P>12. Sincere thanks for our epics.  They are great.  Also thank you for the effect on the Tolan BP.  Very unique and creative.

</FONT><HR>PaperMoon,<P>Nice post. I am ok with the 4+ zone hike. I've been doing it for over a year. I do think it's a good example of why Rangers need better than a druid-shaman defense. <P>Rangers need more than 200 defense. <P>Even with more defense, Rangers will still have low AC armor, low dodge, low parry, low reposte, low HP.<P>Please, bump defense to 220-230.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, lots of posts asking for higher defense, I don't agree with this.  As absor defined it, a Ranger is a Warrior who has traded his/her defense/ac/hp for spells.<P>So if this is the case then Jolt should be moved to 49 and have its resist lowered.  If we are to be looked at like a rogue as far as high offense and low defense then we certainly need an evade skill/spell.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well I have to say all good posts yet and no "flames" yet.  Now for my little say in this  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"><P>As for the AC/Defence/Offence issues - I have to say that AC/Defence is really not needed cause we are not there to be the Main Tank. Offence was given on Test cause we are there to do Damage, not take it like a Warrior does.<P>For HP issues -- Yes a little more would help us.  For me I have a Ton of HP gear on (stats are kinda low because of it) now at Lvl 55 I have 1486hp and with my gear on (Unbuffed) 1830 and with SLD and SoN I have 2105.  Now for that HP increase I had to sacrifice a TON of AC/Stat gear for it.  Now without that Gear on my Hp would be around 1761 (self-buffed) - I see that a HP increse is more handly then a AC increse IMO.<P>Didn't help either that a lvl 45 Warrior with banded/Crafted on still had 400hp more then me at 55 with the HP gear (selfbuffed) on.<P>Archery/Trueshot issues -- This really has to be fixed.  I HATE to use Trueshot at Lvl 55 with a dex of 255 and a skill of 220 in Archery (With some Dex gear and Boon of the Garou-buffed) and I would still miss 10-15 times in a row.  YES 10-15 in a row.  And the ever annoying "You hit for double damage" and then see the Non-melee for 2 points of damage and 4 damage for Trueshot.  The "poofing" arrow is another annoying problem with Archery.<P>The new changes on Test<P>a) Add Endure Cold at 22 (Good for PvP and lower-lvls)<BR>b) Add Skin Like Nature at 59 (Kinda useless - at that lvl in a group most likely there would be a Cleric/Druid anyway - Nice solo spell though)<BR>c) Add FireFist at 22 (Another nice low-lvl spell)<BR>d) Move Bramblecoat from 49 to 39 <BR>e) Add Spikecoat at 49 ((Nice upgrade - but only adds 7AC and 1 more dmg shield pt)<BR>f) Add resist cold at 55 (Helpful in PvP - but in Raids, Druids will most likely be there)<BR>g) Add Panic Animal at 22 (Not needed and this would be a fast powerlvler for Rangers)<BR>i) Offense and weapons skill made identical to warriors (This one I like)<P>They are nice, but I hope better spells can be placed there thou.<P>Special ability -- (Like LoH for Pallies and HT for SK's)  Would be nice to have a 1 day ability.  As Pallies can Heal and HT get Instant damage, Rangers could get a 1 day Ability DoT.  Could call it ehhhh "Fury of Nature".  Just like the Pally/SK raises in Damage as you lvl increases.  But would stack with other DoT's, just not with another Rangers "Fury of Nature" and make it not able to be "de-buffed" by Cancel Magic type spells/items.<P>And Pets are NOT needed at all.<P>Taivek <BR>55 Outrider<BR>Tallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am pretty sure Absor has heard just about every possible thing that every ranger in all of Norrath wants.  I only hope that the appropriate changes are made and not the ones that don't make sense.  <P>1) Why do we have less HP than a pally or SK?  Makes no sense.  Give us the same HP as them.  I understand why we have less AC, but HP?  Fix this.<P>2) Why do we have the same Defense bonus as a druid, cleric, or shaman?  Makes no sense.  Atleast move it up to where a bard's Defense bonus is.<P>3) Dodge, Parry and Riposte.  Dodge should be better than every other class minus monks and rogues (don't know if this is so now, noticed my dodge went up some after a 4 month absence from EQ).  Parry should be the same as SKs and Pallys.  Riposte should be the higher.  Currently it is 150, change it to atleast 210.<P>4) Why don't we have self ports?  We are part druid right?  I don't want bind or gate (unless of course pallies and SKs get it).  Just give me the 19th level self ports a druid gets and one to the DL and one to Iceclad.  This one makes so much sense that I have other classes complain on our behalf.<P>5) Tolan's boots are ridiculously hard to get.  Change this please.<P>6) Greater Healing should not be 57th.  Maybe 54th?<P>7) Jolt needs to be a 50th level spell, not 55th.<P>There are probably a bunch of other things that I am missing, but these are the ones I know of personally.<P>Chasmyr Trueplaya<BR>54th Ranger<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Class balance issue for the Ranger is really GROUP  DESIRABILITY... as a matter of fact, by giving so  much to pure melees, and giving only small enhancements to Hybrids after ROK has been released, we Hybrids and particularly rangers have no REAL role in a group... in effect, everything we can do is done probably BETTER by our parent class: <BR>- druids buffs are far superior than ours (and druids buffs themeselves are mostly less usefull than the otehr class one (cleric and shaman have better version than duids ones ))<BR>- Tanking: lets not talk about it ; enough people gave their opinions and I agree with them... We are SUPPOSED to be tank (taunt..) but in fact WE ARE NOT.<BR>- Melee Dammage: Until the recent changes on test server, we are the 4th damage dealing class after Rogue, Monk and Warrio.<BR>So once gain, my question is: WHY TAKE A RANGER IN A GROUP WHEN YOU CAN TAKE A WARRIOR, ROGUE, MONK for the melee damage, A WARRIOR, MONK, PAL, SK for tanking, A SHAMAN, A DRUID for buffs ---&gt; I think the Ranger is the easieast class to replace, and in most case FOR THE BETTER, in a group.<P>Well there are many things to talk about but I think it has been discussed by my fellow rangers in this thread.<P>Whatever is going to be the adjustment for this class, MAKE IT MORE DESIRABLE FOR A GROUP.

</FONT><HR>The defense argument is very simple.<P>There are 3 factors<P>1) Ranger Defense skill was completely ignored with RoK, while Knights received significant chages to Offense and defense.<BR>2) Parry, Dodge and Riposte were ignored with RoK. Parry and Dodge were increased to the same proportion as they existed pre-RoK after Verant realized that they messed that one up. However, Riposte was never increased to the same proportions pre-RoK.<BR>3) Rangers have significantly lower AC on Armor, which is fine.<BR>4) Rangers have noticibly few HP than Knights.<BR>5) Due to having high offensive abilities, plus a few very high aggro spells, like snare, Rangers incurr a good deal of aggro. To solve this aggro problem Rangers have to back out of fights, which lessens their damage output, for which they sacrificed defensive abilities (notably Plate armor).<BR>6) Jolt doesnt work on velious for the most part.<BR>7) Rangers are a fine class and can do very well if played intelligently. But the disparity in Defense and similarity in offense between the Hybrids is unjustifiable.<P>Since Rangers are Offensive and Knights are Defensive, it is reasonable that Rangers should defend as well as Knights offend.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Nice changes on test. I'd like to mention those things that I believe require change, although all of them have been brought up many times in this discussion.<P>1. Eyes of the Cat: Worthless to the majority of Rangers out there. Make it target-specific (rather than self-only) to make it group-friendly AND make it ultravision so that all Rangers can use it. <P>2. See Invisible: I do not understand why we don't get this. Give us this spell one spell level after camoflage. Or, better yet, make Eyes of the Cat have a See Invisible component and make it target-specific. Currently, our camoflage line has no group-utility because we can't allow our group-mates to see us during travel. I generally have to invis everyone but myself in order to guide a group, which significantly decreases the safety aspect of this spell.<P>3. Self-only Bind in Outdoors: I know this is controversial, but it makes sense to me. We're casters; we are masters of the outdoors; we should be able to bind ourselves there.<P>4. Defense: Make our defense caps (all of the defensive skills) equal to those of the other offensive melee classes. This increases our utility by allowing us to maintain our offensive output during melee. We should not have any defensive skills equal to those of a caster. Personally, I think our AC should easily be better than those of any casting class (whose main role never involves direct melee contact).<P>5. Archery: I'm the best archer in the land. If I can see it, I can hit it (subject to skill check). That's the way it should be. The line of sight arguments and "free" damage arguments are garbage (anyone who practices archery knows that it is by no means free).<P>6. Cancel Magic: It takes up to 3 casts of this level 30 spell on Drachnids in the Dreadlands to remove a damage shield. This removes me from combat for a significant period of time (even when I pull with the spell). We don't get Nullify Magic until 58. Move Cancel to 22 and Nullify to 39.<P>7. Ranger-only drops: For those very rare items that are Ranger-only, make them No Drop. I'm tired of seeing non-Rangers rolling for and auction Ranger items for ridiculous prices. If it's a more common drop, fine; if it's going to take a lot of fighting or be in a difficult location, it should be No Drop (I'd like to hear "Tolan's Gloves dropped, come and get 'em" or "Lupine Dagger - Ranger only on the Captain."<P>Thank you.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I hope you are still reading  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>I play a ranger on tallon zek, level 50 now.<BR>I like the idea of more offense coming our way than defense. I even think outdamaging warrior should be feasible.<P>Why? We are raners, nible and quick, and able to use our strength in swinging that mighty weapon HARD. Warriors and palidns and shadowknights have that heavy bulky armor on.. makes it more difficult and less acurate right?<P>So they deserve the better defense. I am find with that. They are tanks, and we are the humvee's  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Defensively however, we shuld have higher caps in dodge. LIke the arguement above, due to our leather armor, we can move swiftly and avoid the blows better than the guy in all the plate, right?<P>Other ranger stuff to address..<P>I worship Karana.. therefor I get nothing out of the plane of Growth. I cant hunt there, or else ruin all my quests in Greater feydark (more hthan half the ranger quests, including FA). I have no armor drops there, and the quests yeild Tunare-worshipers only gear. Please give me something! (and dont hide it in the plane of Michief!).<P>Quests.. many are unfinished. I would love to get that crossbow in the dorf town, but the quest is unfinsished. I lovve the coldain insignia ring quest (well done!) however step 9 is broken, and the effect of the ring wont stack with one of our buffs, nulifying the greatness of the ring.. <P>Armor graphics.. Not sure why in Velious we find ourselves in gold.. can't blend into the forest to wellnow! I love the graphic sed on the petrified bark leggings, any chance we can see that in other leggings as well?<P>I am on a PvP server, which is hard I tell ya for a ranger. (hard for melee'ers to begin with, let alone a ranger with so few hitpoints the casters drop you in 2 spells).. What would level the field you ask? For me it is something quite simple, and wont disrupt the PvE game. Make the ebony blade root proc unresistable. or better yet, give us a spell that gives the root proc to our blade (like call of sky), with that root being unresistable. That would atleast give us a chance at those casting while running, levitating, jbooting casters!<P>Please finish the tracking promises that were made.<P>wish list? <BR>we are friends with the animals right? So we should be able to 'befriend' them, where they act like a pet  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>again, to counter many others.. more offense, not defense!<P>Thanks for your time in reading this.

</FONT><HR>Hail<P>I'm a level 29 ranger, this is my main character in the game and I love playing this character.<P>I would say that I solo more than I group currently as my playing time is limited and I am running around trying to do other quests between hunting.<P>My main gripe with playing my Ranger is Archery.. Hundred's of my arrows disappear into no where and across most of Velious it's impossible to use my bow to get a mob's hp down due to stupid line of sight tests.. PLEASE fix this line of sight and disappearing arrows thing. Also I would like to see some sort of ranger only archery improvement for lower levels.. Considering we are supposed to be an offensive hybrid we don't seem to do as much damage with the weapon Ranger's are normally associated with (the bow).<P>I also think SoW should be kept at 39.. although I'd love to have permanent SoW at level 29 I feel that it is something to earn as a ranger.. but I also think that a lot of our other spells are totally misplaced level wise.. And there are massive gaps in our spells (panic animal is nice to see, as is endure cold).. but what about AE's and some DoT's which do something other than stopping a mob's hp regen taking effect.. <P>The only other request I make is for a class defining ability.. LoH and HT are great abilities and I'd love to see us get an ability related to what we are supposed to be.. the offensive hybrid's... how about a few minute beserker mode (rage of the bear? i dunno).. it could add 20STR and give us haste or something.. usable once a day like other abilities and make us actually do damage like we apparently can..<P>Thank you for listening.. and my apologies for the bad writing style (just typing off the top of my head at work =)<P>--<BR>Barogio Swiftarrow, 29th Ranger<BR>Officer of Keltic Legion<BR>Vallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Rangers are a melee class.  From my 1+ year of experience in EQ, I can tell that Verant intended for melee classes to either be high damage output, low tanking ability; low damage output, high tanking ability; or both.  Here's the breakdown from what I see:<P>High Damage, Low Tanking: Rogue, Monk<BR>Low Damage, High Tanking: SK, Pally<BR>High Damage, High Tanking: Warrior<P>I really don't know where to put bards. They're weird.. hehe.<P>Anyway, Verant seems to be placing Rangers under the high damage, low tanking category.  That's fine, I can handle that.  Rogues and Monks, however, have ways to mitigate their position on the hate list (evade, FD).  Rangers do not get this until level 55, well after the "low tanking" aspect of rangers becomes apparent in the mid-to-high 40s.  For this reason, I would request that you consider moving Jolt to level 49-51.<P>I would like Verant to maintain the vision of a ranger being a light, agile melee class.  I don't mind getting hit hard because of low AC, but ONLY IF I have a greater chance of avoiding/dodging/parrying/riposting attacks.  If we are limited to chain armor, I don't see how a warrior in full plate can avoid attacks better than us.  How can anyone even justify that with any amount of common sense?  For these reasons, I think ranger defense/dodge/parry (maybe riposte, but not necessarily) should be just under monk/rogue caps.  Plate wearing classes should be under us.  I don't know what the caps comparisons for those skills look like offhand, but why not do what makes sense?  Make the caps reflect the light, agile melee damage dealer who is not burdened by plate armor.  Also, make AGI and DEX mean a whole lot more when making damage avoidance checks.  Consider race size, too.  I don't care if that Ogre has 200 AGI, he is still gonna get hit more than the Gnome with 100 AGI... because he's like 10 times bigger! It only makes sense.<P>Okay, back to rangers.  Fix archery.  I hate lining up a shot and constantly firing an arrow into the ground 3 feet in front of a mob because of the geometry.  I'm a frickin master archer, all right?  You'd think I'd know to aim a little higher.<P>Un-nerf trueshot.  The minimum damage needs to be what was originally described.  None of this "A moss snake was hit for 4 points of non-melee damage!" crap while using the discipline.  I can hit a moss snake for 4 points of damage with my bow at level 3.  This is a joke.<P>Fix tracking.  I know the tracking changes were mentioned and planned, and quite frankly, we can't wait for them... they sound awesome!  Any sort of timeline for us?  And remember, we're the masters of tracking... let's make that mean something again.<P>Finally, I'd like to thank Verant and the ranger community for putting time and effort into fixing our class.  A lot of us have valid points and reasonable requests.  Please do what makes sense.  Ignore the "we want bind, we want teleport" people and just do what makes sense for us.  Rangers, please justify what you would like Verant to change not because you want it that way, or not because it makes us more powerful.  Justify it because your change would balance us and would make sense for our class.<P>Yendor Lootmonkey<BR>Level 51 Pathfinder<BR>Champion of Newbie Rangers<BR>Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Forgot one: <P>Tracking: Where are the changes? Everytime someone asks me to use Tracking to pull to the group, I'm embarrassed to say that the skill is essentially useless at higher levels (except to track errant group members). Something can be right next to me and I'll never see it on track. The chances of a specific MOB appearing on my small track screen from the dozens of MOBs in a zone AND then being within a reasonable distance for me to go and get it and bring it back are slim to none.<P>Our Tracking radius SHOULD conver the whole zone. Therefore, we need the (promised) scrolling window with MOBs sorted by distance from my location (and starting right next to me) and extending out as far as that radius goes.<P>It's nice that Verant has taken the time to add new worlds to explore. It's NOT nice that we have no CLASS-SPECIFIC role in exploring them.<P>Additionally (although I would not add this if it would hold the Tracking changes up even more), it would be nice to have the Tracking screen give some indication of the MOBs direction from our location prior to actually selecting that MOB for tracking.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Don't know if you have changed the cap for disarm, but I really dont see this skill as a ranger trait. Only use it for taunting purposes. Make it useful or get rid of it ;-)<P>2. I never understood why melee skills are capped at 200 at level 39/40. Then from 51 they start rising again. In short, I dont get better at using my weapons for 10 levels. Why???<P>3.

</FONT><HR>Briefly: (explanations below)<BR>1)Bind affinity in any zone<BR>2)No need for greater defense skills... higher HP is whats called for.<BR>3)HP in the same neighborhood as a Pally or SK<BR>4)SoW at levl 30<BR>(programming issues / bugs)<BR>5)Tracking... rangers need to be special<BR>6)Archery... it only matters when a ranger is solo-kiting a mob... and we want to encourage GROUP play, not soloing... even in the 20s and 30s.  Besides, my levl 22 ignite spell does more damage than a critical hit, and doesnt cost me and plat.<P>Just a few comments from A lvl 31 ranger.  Im not involved in too may raids, and Im not in the level 50s yet, but Ive played him for over 2 months and can tell you a few things about ranging and make a few suggestions.<P>1) Why in the world does a Ranger... the uber-woodsman... need to be bound in a city.  Rangers HATE cities.  Rangers should be a class that can be bound anywhere.  That would allow them to go to zones that arent frequented by the tanks (war,rog,sk,pal,mon) and group with the casters.  <P>2) Defense defense defense, I am just starting to learn that even a green mob can wipe the floor with me if Im not either very well prepared or in a group with a healer.  Since my late teens Ive been a pretty descent mana-drain, but things are starting to get out of control.  I understand that the Ranger is supposed to be an offensive hybird, but our natural agility and the freedom afforded us by not wearing plate armor should allow us to dodge more blows, so I would like to see that skill increased.<P>3)  Hit points: While rangers are given the gift of dual wield, it in no way should penalize the hit points we can accumulate.  While we should also be able to avoid being hit better than our plate-wearing friends, we will still get hit for more damage than the other melee classes, and when we do.. it HURTS.  However, this does not mean that our well of HP should be any less than any other hybrid class.  <P>Consider the 3 hybrid classes, if each player were completely naked, and fought hand to hand with no magic... it should be a complete draw, but the ranger would lose easily to the other two, because he has no LoH or HarmTouch.  Rangers simply do not stand a chance.  So verant if you can fix THAT scenario, I think everything else will fall into place.<P>4)  Rangers need SoW at levl30.. while it still matters, at levl 39, a good number of our comrades now have JBoots or can easily get a port to anywhere they want to go, so who cares about SoW.<P>5)Tracking.. as my tracking skill has increased, I have found it less and less useful, especially when in relatively newbies zones when I am looking for a named mob.  The problem with tracking is that since it prioritzes based on the most recent spawn, as the range extends, I get more and more "noise" from mobs that are killed with great frequency, and the named, or rare spawns dont make the top 20 in most recent spawn time, so it is becoming useless.  I rarely use it anymore except when hunting something we are killing alot of like sarnaks or TM Gnolls.  Try to use tracking to find the Ghoul Messenger in WK though... I can have him in front of me and targeted, but he wont show up on track.<P>6) Archery... Is this a JOKE?  I cant hit something that is 2 feet above or below me, and I dont do enough damage anyways to worry about it... better to cast Ignite which does 37 damage (more than I can crit for) and hits MUCH more often than a crit anyways.<P>Dlaritan LionsBane<BR>&lt;Divine Prophecy&gt;<BR>31 Ranger<BR>Xev</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>make AGILITY a USEFUL stat.  As of right now, as long as you have an agility of 75, anything above that is irrelevant.  To change this, I think that instead of the 5-10 points of agility above 75 to get ONE AC point, all agility over 75 should be calculated like this.  For every 2 agility points over 75, you should get 1 AC point.  This should be for ALL races and classes, not just rangers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Thanks for the ear Absor.I believe that Verant is serious about balancing the classes and has made some nice changes to the game of late. My few requests:<BR>1.Please upgrade the defense of Rangers to 230.We get beaten down by mobs too fast and everyone knows it.Our ac restrictions will still ensure that we'll never tank like a warrior,Pally,or SK by far.<BR>2.Increase our hp's by about 600 in graduating amounts from levels 45-60.Why are we so far behind all other tanks in this respect? Makes no sense to me...<BR>3.Please fix the stacking issues of the new spells.Nuff said about that and I think all know was just a coding booboo.Hopefully fixed next patch.<BR>4.PLEASE give us see invisable! We are the only class in the game capable of casting invis(camo) but with no way to see ourselves or are group.Must have been an oversight and it's long overdue to be fixed.<BR>5.Jolt.Just make it flat out unresistable.It costs a fair amount to cast and takes us out of battle to do so(unlike rogues evade).Really needs to work each time.<BR>I really believe if these were implemented Rangers would become equal in value to the other hybrids.Yes we'd have no special abilities like harm touch/lay hands but our various abilities would all add up.I thank you again for listening to our urgent plea. :O)<BR>                        Teak-Ranger 55th season</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Very nice thread here. I would like to echo others in thanking VI for taking the time to look at our requests and contemplate our ideas.<P>Looks like we're all asking for almost the same thing, so here goes my wish list, which is little more than an agreement with all the other great ideas that have been brought out in this thread.<P>First, while I did solo quite a bit until my late teens, I'm not too fond of ideas or changes that make me better at soloing. I enjoy grouping immensly, and that's sort of what I gather VI wanted with EverQuest, so the changes I would like to see made should make me more desirable in groups, not more effective as a solo'er.<P>So, with that said, here's my primary list of desires:<P>1) Fix tracking. This has been beaten to death, but let me kick it in the head once again: Give us a scrollbar so we can see everything within our tracking range. Allow us to sort by distance and/or con level. Give us more filtering options, like filtering out things that con at a certain level, or even filtering out NPCs like guards and/or merchants. Without this, the track skill becomes useless after a certain level. For example, My tracking is at 180. I can track a merchant on the other side of the zone, but I can't see the orc standing right next to me. I play with my wife, who plays a druid, and she does all of the tracking now as it's much more useful at the lower skill level (she can see things that are closer to us).<BR>2) Fletching needs a dramatic upgrade. I stopped working on fletching at 102, as it was simply not cost effective. It's very difficult to make money from it, as archery is a skill only useful for pulling (more on that later), and thus no-one wants to pay 700p for a high-end fletched bow (that probably cost me 4x that amount to make due to the rediculously high failure rates). Also, arrows are just too expensive, and don't seem to make that much difference in damage anyway (I've hit for 1 point of damage using 1 dmg arrows as well as 5dmg arrows). Since arrows can't be recovered (which has been suggested before, an idea I strongly agree with), and I can get summoned arrows rather easily (and cheaper I might add), fletching as a skill is relatively useless. I'd like to see a dramatic increase in the number of bows that can be made, arrows that proc (which may require the addition of more ranger spells), a decrease in failure rate on the upper range bows, and a decrease in compoent cost for upper range bows and arrows.<BR>3) While I'm only a level 35 ranger, the discussions I've seen on the Trueshot discipline really concern me. Without the benefit of first hand experience, I can't suggest a fix, but I would definately like to see rangers discussing this discipline in a favorable light, so obviously something needs to be done about it. Perhaps the addition of more ranger only/no drop bows with higher damage and lower dly would help this some.<BR>4) I have to agree with everyone on the need for more HP, or barring that some additional self only buffs that stack with others to give us more HP.  We have the same HP as caster classes at the higher levels? Does this make sense if we're supposed to be an offensive melee class?<BR>5) I would also like to see defense raised to 230, perhaps even higher. This has been suggested before, a flip-flop of the offense/defense of SKs/Paladins.  It's been said that we have low AC, low HP, and low defense because we can duel wield. That's too much of a penalty for duel weild, in my opinion. We need to have an increase in HP, AC, defense, or all three; giving us the ability to duel wield in exchange for all 3 just gives us the ability to MAYBE do a little more damage at the expense of being MUCH easier to hit and kill.<BR>6) All of the other hybrids have some sort of unique skill that's not available in other classes. For example:<BR>	Paladins: Lay of hands<BR>	Shadowknights: Harm touch<BR>	Rogues: Backstab<BR>	Monks: Kill a MOB with one strike (Ashenhand)<BR>	Rangers: nothing<BR>We do not have any sort of truly unique skill (bards and druids get tracking, and that doesn't have anything to do with combat). We need some sort of ranger-only ability to equal that given to the other hybrids. How about a skill and/or ability that gives us a chance to kill a creature with one shot from a bow? Make it a discipline/skill whatever. You can call it a 'called shot', if you will.  I think that Trueshot was meant to be this 'ranger only' ability, but as I've said before, from previous discussions I've seen, it's sorely lacking.<BR>7) We should have the dodge/parry/riposte caps of rogues/monks. To quote a previous post: 'Being a dual wielding class, we should be better at skills like parry and riposte over classes that are limited to one weapon. Being limited to lighter chain classes of armor would make you believe we should be able to dodge better then someone in full plate. Its pretty amazing if you look at it from that angle that ranger dodge/parry/riposte are lower then Paladin/SK's. I understand everyone wants more defense, but if our dodge was in the neighborhood of Rogues (who also wear likewise armor) and parry/riposte were more like warriors (whose weapon skills we should be equal with) then I think we would be hit less often and not need a serious defensive upgrade.' In fact, I think we should have the riposte cap of warriors, as it's almost an offensive skill.<BR>8) We should also have the evade skill. Like rogues, we wear light armor and have a high agility/dex. You would think that this combination would allow us to have a skill like evade (light armor+high agi+high dex=ability to evade/dodge). This might also increase our chances of survival.<BR>9) Archery is broken. Again, this horse has been beaten to death, but to reiterate: the whole 'your target is too high/low' is rediculous, and looks more like the work of a lazy programmer and a shortcoming of the engine than any real believable explaination. I should be able to hit anything as long as I can see a majority of it. Archery is useless right now for anything but pulling. It should be a very viable form of combat for rangers, if not THE main form of combat. If you made archery as effective if not more so than hand-to-hand melee combat, there would be no need for higher defense or hitpoints, we'd kill our MOB's from a distance, which is my vision as a ranger anyway. We should get double/triple attacks with the bow (this has been covered before). We should even get crippling blows with the bow. The ranger should be THE MASTER of the bow bar none, and should be able to do more damage with a bow than any other class, and this damage should be at least as much as you could do in hand-to-hand combat, if not significantly more so.<P><BR>Now that I've written a novel, here's my take on what's already been done on test:<P>a) Add Endure Cold at 22: May be useful in some situations, and in-line with what a ranger should be able to do.<BR>b) Add Skin Like Nature at 59: Excellent, but again I think there are stacking issues with this spell that need to be removed.<BR>c) Add FireFist at 22: Good, but needs to stack with other spells.<BR>d) Move Bramblecoat from 49 to 39: Excellent.<BR>e) Add Spikecoat at 49: excellent.<BR>f) Add resist cold at 55: May be useful in some situations, and in-line with what a ranger should be able to do.<BR>g) Add Panic Animal at 22: not necessary, and not in line with what I see as a ranger. Replace with either charm animal or another DD fire/cold spell. I'd prefer a charm animal spell where the animal didn't agro after the spell wore off. I find it rediculous that shamans get a wolf pet, shadow knights get some sort of pet, but neither druids nor rangers get this ability.<BR>i) Offense and weapons skill made identical to warriors: excellent start<P>What the heck, I'm on a roll. Here's my pie-in-the-sky wishlist for rangers:<P>1) Give us more unique spells (ranger only). With a druid/shaman in the group, my buffs are next to useless, and my DD spells are so weak that I could do more damage in melee in the time it takes to cast them that they simply don't get used. End result: I become little more than a weak tank and a mana sponge. If we had more unique, ranger only spells (perhaps a line of ranger only DD spells that do similar damage to Druid spells at the same level). The new spells are nice, but they have stacking issues that need to be removed in order to make them more useful in grouping situations. What about a series of ranger-only dots that stack with Druid dots?<BR>2) Give us a few more shaman buffs, like some buffs for dex and stamina. This would round out our selection of buff spells nicely, and make us more useful in groups with druids but no shamans.<BR>3) Let us reclaim arrows from corpses. This will offset the cost of fletching these arrows. Perhaps we could recover only those arrows that actually hit.<BR>4) Lower the level at which we get SoW. I know others have debated this, but if we're supposed to be a lightly armored, fast attack unit, then give us the ability to be fast.<BR>5) Give us a haste spell at 39 (or 49 even), goes along with the idea that we're lightly armored, fast attack units.<BR>6) A questable cold based spell at 49, like call of flame, is a great idea (to quote a previous post).<BR>7) If we're supposed to be the most offense based hybrid, give us triple attack at 60, and allow us to do critical hits with our primary hand weapon. That would increase the damage output of rangers nicely, making us more desirable in groups and perhaps make us useful on the uber-MOB raids.<P>Ok, one more. On the whole idea of porting/binding: I don't think we need to have group ports. To be honest, I'd rather have my combat abilities enhanced dramatically than be able to self port to various parts of the world. Ports are cheap to begin with (I can always find a port in 5-10 minutes), and it really woudldn't increase my ability to get into a group. As for the binding issue, I think this would be fixed by the addition of more melee bind spots as has been promised by VI. While these would indeed be nice, they are low on my list, personally.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I forgot a few points I also wanted to add before posting:<P>1) GROUPABILITY IN DUNGEONS<BR>I don't know about you other Rangers out there but I'm an outdoors type of Ranger. I don't like dungeons much. Yet, we are forced to go to dungeons to get most of our best items (and experience, not to forget). And still how group friendly do you consider a Ranger to be in a dungeon situation? None at all. I'd like this to be changed.<P>1) FLETCHING<BR>Could there be a way to make fletching a trade skill worth picking up other than for being able to make your own arrows and a bow? Verant made Alchemy one of the most sweet trading skills from nothing by adding all possibility to create potions with some of the most useful abilities/buffs/spells (SoW, IVU, TP...) I have sold 2 bows and about 200 arrows during my 51 levels. I am not at 200 skill, but a few points from. Once, mind you, once, someone asked me if I could make a bow for him. How often do you see people looking for potions? Bows? Arrows? Could fletching be made a "trade" skill? YES. Let us (no others, us = Rangers) add enchantments to our bows and arrows. Arrows with a Stun proc (if archery is tuned) will sell. Arrows with a DOT will sell. Bows with various procs will sell.<P>3) HALF-ELF RANGERS<BR>And why oh why are Half-Elves treated like the least worthwhile race in the whole of EQ. We are hit with a wis/mana penalty. Wood-Elves do not. They get additional bonuses (at some point I trust - can't wait to see what this will end up like) cultural fletching and forage at earlier level. For what reason? Half-Elves have better looks? :-) I don't get it. Explain.<P>--Dark, 51 Half-Elf Ranger<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Thanks for initiating these balance threads Absor!<P>Since the all-important defence, HP and dodge/parry/riposte caps issues have been restated many many times I'd just like to add my support for them without going back over the very sensible arguments in their favour. <P>Beyond those fundamental balancing issues I very strongly believe rangers need a revamp to archery as a balancing issue, not a wish-list issue - we should be able to contribute something distinctive to a group that a druid (as just the most obvious 'overlapping' class) cannot.<P>For starters how about a once-a-day skill comparable in utility and power to LoH or HT? How about a bow shot that kills outright whites and below IF their health is already below half and you're shooting at their back and the archer is stationary. Kicks in at lev 9 - ranger only. This could be a great last-ditch save for casters who have aggroed beyond recall - a useful, group-friendly ability that utilises our class defining weapon and allows almost ALL rangers, not just 55 and above, some kind of distinctive contribution via archery. Could be called Finishing Shot or something...Powerful but not unbalancing if only usable once per day.<P>Finally, please, please get the team to make archery as a whole more fun and less heartbreaking for a ranger (how would rogues feel if backstab was partially broken, almost useless in terms of damage dealt beyond level 20 or so, and massively expensive to use anyway to its full damage dealing potential via high-end arrows.)<P>How about: Minimum damage - 2x Arrow dam + any attack/dex bonuses applicable (for all bow-using classes.)<P>Double Attack (ranger only) - kicks in when d.a. kicks in at 17 or if you feel stingy when off-hand double attack kicks in (29?)<P>Chance for Crips based on same chances warriors get in melee (ranger only)<P>Damage bonus based on the same tables that govern the bonus for main hand melee, but capped earlier (40 or so?) if you feel this would be overpowering (all melee classes, perhaps, but ranger only if it would be perceived as too powerful to be implemented across the board.)<P>In general I feel it's a shame that rangers have to wait till 40 before archery becomes even remotely close to being tactically useful...and surely there's a world of difference between 'tactically useful' and 'primary form of combat'?<P>Finally, rather than fiddling with Jolt (an inelegant and non-RP solution to a critical problem) why not just give us a form of Evade at level 35 or so, low enough for us to train it up before the hell levels? This would be so much more in keeping with the class. Could be called something other than Evade to make it distinctivelt rangerly, but surely this would be a 'cleaner' solution to the almost crippling aggro problem?<P>Once again, thanks for listening. Great to have a real opportunity to get such things off our collective chest!<P><BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok I am a level 24 ranger who has played my ranger from the day Everquest came on the market.  I would say that rangers are fairly balanced at the midlevel range  I do not want us to be overpowered and to attract d00d players.  Therefore I think that panic animal is unnecessary and unwelcome.  I  would far rather have more animals that liked me than otherwise.  Maybe befriend animal and maybe just a broader definition of what an animals for those animals that are not supposed to attack us unless attacked.<P>Apparently there are more problems at high levels so I will let high levels deal with that.  I would like to see archery fixed.  The can't see the animal and elevation issues are ridiculous.  I would like to have some sort of a targeting system.  If we could aim our arrows that would make a huge difference.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
