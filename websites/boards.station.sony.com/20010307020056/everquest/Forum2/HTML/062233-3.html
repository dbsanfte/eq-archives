No.<P>If the board were titled "General Discussion about Everquest", then you'd be right.<P>The Class/Hybrid board is pretty clearly defined.  The Servers/Xengony board is pretty clearly defined.  The Newbie board is pretty clearly defined.<P>This board is NOT defined, and I for one am very glad of it.<P>Comparing five threads of "Your average Druid player is a total jerk, only playing the class because it's easy", five threads of "All you Cleric players are nothing but whiners", and five threads of "Are too!  Am not!  Are too!" to ONE thread (or even a couple of threads) that are OBVIOUSLY designed to allow people to relax and just be silly (even rude, in a silly way...

</FONT><HR>This whole debate over what's allowed is rather pointless, given that Absor--and Abashi before him--has spoken on the subject.  As they should, Verant has reserved final determination as to what is allowed here.<P>Why was the Iraq thread closed?  Because it had become a rather heated political discussion.  Same as the WWII thread(s).<P>Why is Part 2 (Part 6) allowed to stay open?  Because it is harmless fun.<P>The rules are quite clear: be civil, and don't spam (either through bumping or continuous nonsense).  What, exactly, comprises civility and moderation is at the discretion of Auric and his colleagues.<P>So, are there any actual questions, or simply more pointless whining?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>nazgaroth, you poor thing, you.<P>I just couldn't help but notice your last post and laugh a little, but keep in mind I'm just pointing this out civilly, not trying to get you in trouble.  Just one of those things.<P>Absor gave you a slap on the wrist about the juvenile thing.  OK.  Then you posted apologizing about breaking the rules, and said you'd try to be better.  Then (this is what made me laugh), you pointed out an off-topic post by drawing our attention away from this one, also against the rules.  I know you didn't mean to, but did anyone else catch the humor?  Anyhoo...<P>Cab, I'd like to politely ask you to tone it down just a bit, please?  We realize your viewpoint and opinion and interpretation of the rules differ from ours, but watch your conduct just a bit.  You're getting a bit hypocritical by denouncing people "breaking board rules" (and that one's open to interpretation, obviously) then turning right around and breaking board rules of another color.  You said:<P>"I really don't care about these threads and have nothing against grollerdabard or any of the other resident vak's but..." (Required reading for posters on this Message board; page 2; post 5)<P>It's the mention of that disallowed acronym that really gets to me.  It's obvious that most people on this board regard the acronym VAK (I won't say what it means:  If you don't know, you don't need to, and if you do know, you can relate) as something akin to a racial slur.  The use of that one was one of the reasons the boards switched to Account Holders Only.  Wish I had the quote, but I recall Abashi or Aradune mentioning it when the board switched over.  Do us a favor, please, Cabriolet, and follow your own advice when posting, rather than using confrontational, "do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do" methods.

Are you a hypocrite?"&lt;<P>Nope, but thanks for asking.<P>You're right, topics about Iraq are no more on subject than posts about the Simpsons.  But I have to use my discretion about things, and I'm pretty good about knowing which subjects are going to get out of hand, which might offend people (and there were more than enough things in those threads with the potential to offend) and what sort of things just don't belong here.  Yes, I closed those threads.  Perhaps I could have allowed them to remain open, they hadn't gotten to the stage of being completely out of hand.  But I saw no reason to let it continue to that point.<P>Yes, sometimes I do indulge in preventative pruning.<P>Basically, there is no problem with off-topic threads, but there is nothing protecting them either.  But those that are likely to turn into heated issues have a greater chance to be removed.  Such things are totally at the whim of the moderators, and will remain so.  This allows you all to have fun with off-topic posts, while still leaving us the ability to get rid of posts that will offend or that will just cause too much ruckus.<P>SwiftStrike wrote:<P>&gt;"Don't ya think we should know this before it's enforced? After all, I don't have time to read through all the announcements…"&lt;<P>And then<P>&gt;"PS You know as well as I do 99.9999% of the people on this board didn't read through that somewhat tedious list of board rules, or don't know where to find them."&lt;<P>How else would you propose that we let you know that a post is unacceptable?  I'm certainly not going to address an e-mail to all of our subscribers to tell them.  And if I did, some would not read it, as they don't have time to read through all the announcements.<P>Every rule is common sense.  There is nothing there that is counterintuitive.  Post in a polite manner.  Stay on topic for the thread you are posting in.  Do not bump threads or spam just to get attention.  Basically, act like a civilized person and there won't be anything to worry about.<P>Kurisu-san wrote:<P>&gt;"This doesn't make sense. The FAQ specifically limits posts to ON TOPIC. But Absor confirms that light, polite off topic posts are fine. The FAQ needs to be reworded, because these two ideas don't match."&lt;<P>They don't match perfectly, no.  I'll see about getting it changed.  But basically, we can delete any off-topic post.  But we don't.  We only delete the ones that need deleting.  And we don't really want a bunch of off-topic posts eating up the boards.  Some people are actually here to talk about EverQuest.<P>This is all somewhat subjective.  It can't be otherwise.  But I submit that 90% of you could guess which posts should stay and which should be deleted based on the rules and on common sense and you would moderate just as we do.  Some more lenient, some less so, but all within a certain slim degree of error.<P>What I'm telling you is that there is no point in being hyper-technical about this.  We could tear apart any set of rules, unless that set of rules includes something about 'at the discretion of the moderators'.  And, of course, include that and then that would be the topic of debate…<P>Sheesh.  Just post, don't be mean to each other, the readers or us and you should never have a problem.<P>Xula wrote:<P>&gt;"http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/conduct.jsp"&lt;<P>Works for me…<P>Kirilian wrote:<P>&gt;"I'm no prude, but I find handles like "Flaming_***" and "Cloaked**" to be infantile and, quite frankly, assine.

</FONT><HR>From the FAQ: "In general, YOU MAY POST ANY MATERIAL, written in a courteous and mature manner, PROVIDING THAT IT IS ON TOPIC for the forum to which you are posting."<P>---<P>If you have a key you may open the door.<BR>(door doesn't need to be locked, you may open it without the key)<P>If it rains on wednesday, the ground will be wet.<BR>(but it may be wet for other reasons besides rain)<P>This is a typical example of why lawyers and logicians make good bucks.  They are capable of making statements which don't have holes and tearing holes in statements which appear solid.<P>Clearly Verant is hoping for a fun, easy going environment to discuss game issues in.  Even if they have to close posts and ban users to get it.<P>It's kind of a typical corporate move and also similar to that you use to train children and other small animals.  Reward and punishment.<P>There is something so vaguely orwellian about it that it is really quite disturbing when you think about it.<P>But I am being a bit unfair here.  They TRIED to do it the nice and fair way and jerks made it completely impossible.  So it became a decision between shutting the boards down or saying, "Enough is Enough" and as alluded to above, "Stop that fighting, or I'm pulling this car over now!"<P>Relating this to another EQ board- EQVault, it has become almost unusable to anyone who wishes to play EQ instead of flaming or talking about off topic things.  I finally stopped even reading or posting there because it became so pointless and because you know what?  I really am still interested in playing this darn game.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

This is all fine and dandy to me!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  I enjoy fun, nonsensical posts as much as the next GrollerDaBard wannabe!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It seems a phenomenon of Everquest that people think they are due "rights" regarding either the game or the surrounding infrastructure (like message boards).<P>Orwellian?  Big Brother? Police State? Come on...you don't think that is a tad dramatic.<P>Lets face it, there are some people on this board that are just trouble makers.  We wouldn't even need the rule written down if people behaved themselves.  <P>Bottom line...Verant will lock and delete any posts which they want to.  Generally these are posts which are offensive or abusive in some way.  They want to encourage the board community, so they allow some of the lighter posts (go groller!), while removing some of the darker off-topic posts.  They don't need a reason, its THEIR board.<P>And Cab.. just because the 99 percent of the people on the board are reading and not posting, does not mean we are not unaware of your unceasing trolling and mean-spirited class attacks.  No one is being fooled.<P>But we all like GrollerDaBard  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062233-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062233.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062233-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062233-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062233-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=062233&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=062233&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
