</FONT><HR>i read from eq.casters.com that you siad this<P>It makes sense to me. The power of the spell is determined by the level that you get it at. Essentially, if a necromancer gets a spell at 24th level and a shadow knight gets it at 30th, that's a way to control the power of the spells the shadow knight gets. It's essentially 6 levels weaker. Increasing the mana cost for these spells is a way to control the volume of spells, especially since the mana pool for hybrids was brought up recently<P>do you really think that a lvl 30 sk get the lvl 24 necro spells? here it the low down.<P>lvl sk gets spells / lvl necro gets spells<BR>9  / 1 and 4<BR>15 / 4 and 8<BR>22 / 8 and 12<BR>30 / 12 and 16<BR>39 / 16 and 20<BR>49 / 20 and 24<P>i only wanted to bring this up so that you would be informed of the correct spell lvls.  as you can see a lvl 30 SK does not have lvl 24 necro spells.  so to your arguement plz try to get ride of the casting mana penatly for hybrids, or you could just give us the lvl 24 spells at 30 that would make us happy too, jk.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>i hope you read this,<BR>a conserned player,<BR>jj</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Xelene, how about just talking about the post instead of trying to insult his typing?<P>However, on the topic at hand, I think I understand what Absor was talking about, and I think I agree.  I think that a hybrid should be able to cast much fewer spells on a "full tank" of mana in respect to a "primary" caster.<P>The only problem with this is the spells themselves, I think that is the valid point, that by the time you get the spells, the level which you get them at is enough of a penalty that you dont need to increase the mana cost as well.  I see the arguement for the increased mana cost, but since you get spells SO much later then the "primary" class that that is enough of a penalty in and of itself.<P>So in the end (after a good amount of thinking outloud), I think that the "double penalty" of much later level, and increased mana cost might be too much of a penalty.  I think the best way to reduce this penalty would be to reduce the mana cost, if not in line with primary class mana cost, then to be more in line with it.<P>I think it is also important to note that hybrids also cannot specialize which further increases the difference between what a hybrid can do with a "full tank" of mana as opposed to a caster with a full tank.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Zaphid, it is a much bigger difference in level then 20 to 30.  A level 20 spell would be recieved at 44 or 49 for the hybrid in relation to the parent caster class.  In addition to that the spell would also cost more mana then it would for the parent class.<P>So lets say you have spell A, the parent class gets it at 20 and it takes 200 mana.  The hybrid would get it at 49, and it would take 275 mana.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You also have to realize that a hybrid will have a smaller manapool by default... They aren't going to be pumping starting points into int or wis (or at least not many).  Also, they aren't going to be getting tons of items that boost int/wis either.  They are going to be looking for good weapons and good armor/protective gear, a lot of which doesn't have int or wis on it.  <P>Lower int/wis means smaller manapool.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It was a random pair of numbers that I made up by way of example.  Not the use of the word 'if' in the original statement.<P>As for the perception that shadow knights are offensive or defensive… well, I think I can make a far better case for them being considered a defensive class than on offensive one, based solely on their skill caps.  They are a defensive warrior with offensive spell ability.  A paladin is a defensive warrior with defensive spell ability.<P>And, yes, it may very well be the case that the double penalty of later and more expensive spells is wrong.

</FONT><HR>The trouble is Absor, people scrutinise your posts minutely. You may have created these numbers randomly to illustrate a point, but unless you state that fact, we will assume otherwise and correct you if we perceive disparity in information.<P>Everything I have read in all the recent shadowknight posts points to the fact that everyone assumed that you did not know the true level difference between the sk/necro spells because the numbers you posted were so different to what existed ingame. Thus the reason why the original poster felt it necessary to draw attention to it.<P>However I'm sure your shadowknight class knowledge must be rising exponentially after reading all these threads.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Cheers,<BR>Tryst</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I know you said you don't know much, but coming to the board to discuss our issues when you haven't a clue is the first no-no in Public Relations.<BR>I sure as hell can't tell a wizard what they need and don't need because i've never played one, don't have a clue what they can or can't do, or whether they think what they want will balance or unbalance. I couldn't say because i dont' know jack about the class.<BR>But I sure as hell won't stand there and tell a wizard that he's not a 'caster'.

</FONT><HR>Based on Absor's post on eqvault where he said:<P>"As for the perception that shadow knights are offensive or defensive… well, I think I can make a far better case for them being considered a defensive class than on offensive one, based solely on their skill caps. They are a defensive warrior with offensive spell ability. A paladin is a defensive warrior with defensive spell ability." <P>Never in the history of ever, have I seen a defensive Shadow Knight anything. If this was the perception of what the class should be EQ style, then I guess the problems is more the people playing them are expecting a offensive melee skills and caps and offensive spells, with a good mix of both making them a more effective in killing them most classes. <P>If you want to "fix" a class your best option instead of it wasnt intended for this or that, is to look at the posts and within reason make it more of how people are actually playing them.<P>My guess is that nobody is comitted to making the changes needed to make some of these classes really playable and the reason for these talks is someone did the math and found out that 75% of the people in the world are either druids, or necros. <P>Then again, stranger things have happened.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hmm... that is strange, if Shadow Knights are a defensive class.  Then could the skill cap for disarm be raised?  As of now a cap of 70 does nothing against even green mobs. (and yes they are armed)  Out of 10 green mob creatures I have successfully disarmed 1, is this a case of a defensive character?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, i wanna throw out a few coppers from a dead topic....similarly related to this.  Well, as far as ShadowKnights being "DEFENSIVE."<P>If shadowknights are supposed to be a "defensive" class...then why is it that Iksar ShadowKnights cannont wear the ShadowKnight class specific armors?  That whole, plate chaffes their scales argument is a load of hewy.  The racial AC bonus isn't really that significant.  So far any of the ShadowKnight armor that i have seen on spoiler sights is pretty much plate.  Which excludes Iksar from ever wearing...now if ShadowKnights are "defensive" and Iksar can't wear the best armor, does that make the iksar the "not effectivly defensive" hybrid?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Paladins are the defensive warrior with defensive ability, I agree, but then why does every melee class minus the Paladin and Shadowknight have a /riposte /weaponshield type discipline to pull them through even one round of uber mob tanking?  <P>Why does a chain wearing Rogue and leather wearing Monk have such extremely high defensive skill caps that outdo the two plate-armored Knightly classes?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'd be very much in favor of the "useless" spells that were previously given to shadowknights, like the ability to speak through your pet with voice graft, were added back in for flavor.  The spells that were replaced with the lifetap series... would it hurt to have them back as additional spells just for fun and variety?  Everyone said that the spells were generally useless, and I agree, but I still think things like voice graft would be fun to have, even if they are mostly useless for all practical purposes.<P>-Bolas<BR>47 ogre shadowknight<BR>Vallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>errr talking about what needs to be changed in all these classes lets talk about paladins. I'll start by saying I love being a paladin wouldn't trade my character for any class, but what is with all the useless spells we get? Every spell level we recieve spells that neither help us or party memebers are attack is a lot less then a warrior and it should be since we have spells, but cut down casting time since when in a group were tanking mostly actually always and you cant take hits and heal someone without getting interupted so do some more work on the paladin class I hit level 40 recently and let me tell you I have 62 in disarm already and tried this about 50 times all fails whats up with that? I think your close on paladins but there is so more work to be done maybe adding a higher level root spell would help also since when soloing it's hard to take more then one mob and when root fails it's time to fight until death isn't very fun</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052728&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052728&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
