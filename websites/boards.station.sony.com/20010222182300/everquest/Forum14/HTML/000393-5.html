</FONT><HR>You make some valid point on the healing issue LadyHei, but I dissagree on the point of how much we should heal. We shouldn't be able to heal as much as a cleric, even if there were mana drawback put into place. What we should be is at least effective within the resraints that VI has provided for our class. But they haven't done it right. That's what we are saying. Losing our effectiveness to heal like we did pre-39 is the issue, not whether we should heal as much as a cleric.<P>As far as  our buffs not stacking. Considering our buffs 'should' be nature based, they should stack or possibly overwrite another classes buff if the stats are better. <P>Having healing as the only debatable subject for group appeal is absurd. There MUST be other issues addressed.<BR>The pet for example. If other classes use their pet in a group for melee why shouldn't we be able to do this effectively also. (Without the agro).<P>Why shouldn't they add a port location near Qeynos. I think that would appeal to groups also. What if a Permafrost group was assembling in Misty or somewhere, now they ALL have to make the Karana run to get there? Or what about picking a group member up that happens to be in the Qeynos area. Any of these things would appeal to a group.<P>Logantre Askani<BR>Co-Founder Higher Powers of Solusek Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As a player post 50 on the druid, I don't think we need the greater healing.  Druids should be on a par with paladins on healing.  We are offense and buffs not healer, that is totally cleric and shaman areas.  Sure give shaman more heal, but druids aren't healers.  I think if you do up our healing post 50, clerics should be able to do the 1000 plus DD in 4 different lines like us or maybe give them ports?  Or pets like shaman.  Well I just see this balancing as mixxing up what I do best to do what clerics do, and I am not a cleric.  Neither are shaman.  Fix our rings to safe spots, and do some work on our armor, that is about it.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Would it be possible to raise the level cap on Call of Karana or add a new charm with a higher level cap at 55 or 58 or so?  Call caps at 51 or 52, i'm not sure, but about half of shiverbacks gave a "too high" message this weekend.<BR>Maybe a level 60 animal only charm with a level cap of 58 or so and a guaranteed duration (minimum 30 seconds or something) similar to the enchanter spell dictate (and just as mana hungry)<BR>  ( I solo'd a samhain this weekend on 60m at 0 risk in a broken fear. You might want to look at the snare+root stacking issue, or add a snare effect to druid root so these do not stack, oh and if you're wondering, 27 consecutive hours in fear, 13 gorgons. 1 pair of verm boots dropped, which went to the most deserving druid, poor thing was wearing kobald hide)  Honestly, if you want to look at a form of soloing that is overpowered take your sites off of quad-kiting.  Root dotting is nearly as efficient and almost *risk free*. Root/dotting after the snare/root stacking change has become entirely too easy.  There is little skill involved, and even less danger.  You find a blue mob, you pull it. You snare it. You root it. If root breaks you can easily reroot it before it reaches you without even moving.  All the while keeping Winged Death and Drones of Doom on.  Quad kiting on the other hand is VERY dangerous, and requires skill, as well as being exceedingly boring because of the huge down time.  I can fold the laundry, read a book, watch tv, or hold several conversations while root+dotting.  This is hands off game play.  Just have to watch for a "your Engorging Roots spell has worn off" message out of the corner of your eye.  I root dotted that samhain using spirit of oak, before the stacking change I wouldn't have even considered it.  Root dotting was very powerful for druids before the stacking change, but there was some risk.  If root broke and you weren't paying attention you got mauled.<BR>Everytime root broke you might get smacked a few times kiting root back on.  Now if root breaks, you stand up. recast root. take a few steps back, and sit back down.<BR>I don't *want* root/dotting nerfed, but if you want to fix something, fix the broken part.  Quad kiting can be good xp, but there is a great deal of risk involved.  Root dotting as it is now could be done by a trained monkey.<P>Now to the item list...<P>ITEM: Healing.<P>DESCRIPTION: There is a general consensus that <BR>### general consensus couldn't resist pointing<BR>### this out... It's redundant. Sorry =P<BR>clerics are the only useful healers past 50th level. Shamans and Druids are supposed to be secondary healers. But post 50 their spells are too inferior and fizzle too often to be effective as healers at all.<BR>### Exactly.<BR> Some suggestions are to move Superior Heal to level 51 (and reduce its fizzle rate) <BR>### I think most people were talking 44 or 59,<BR>### but I understand not wanting it moved below<BR>### 50 since it would give druids/shamen the same<BR>### "fast" healing power as a cleric until 51.<BR>and/or add in a new one at 56th. Where shamans might be able to use Torpor to fulfill their healing needs,<BR>### I take this as proof that you read my posts =P<BR>### Does this mean that torpor is being moved to <BR>### 56?<BR> we may need to make a new spell for druids at that level. <BR>### Good deal. Just make sure it's efficient.<BR>We also need to be careful not to make them too good at healing. That’s the cleric’s turf. <BR>### Not going to happen as long as cheal is in the<BR>### game. Simply put, if you give druids/shamen a<BR>### spell that costs 400 mana and takes 10 seconds<BR>### to cast (see my photosynthesis suggestion in <BR>### druid talk part 5 (or was it 6?) and is NOT<BR>### a complete heal we will still be inferior to<BR>### clerics as a healing class.  Cheal is what <BR>### gives them the huge lead on every other class.<BR>### Stating again.<BR>### Photosynthesis<BR>### Regeneration for 1200(56) to 1600(60) over<BR>### 10 ticks<BR>### Decrease movement rate 56%<BR>### Mana Cost: 400<BR>### Casting Time: 10seconds<BR>### Recast Delay: 30seconds<BR>### Spell Duration: 10ticks (60 seconds)<BR>### It is still vastly inferior to Cheal, but way<BR>### more efficient than any other heal we get.<BR>Whatever is done here should also be done with shaman, in some similar fashion<BR>### I agree. Torpor to 56, Photosynthesis at 56. <BR>### Nature's Touch for druids at 60, and the same<BR>### spell with a different name (Touch of the<BR>### Spirits maybe?) for Shamen at 60. For raids.<BR> (though probably not the same way).<P>ITEM: Charm Animals.<P>DESCRIPTION: Druids like the idea of being able to charm pets without making them angry. But this has a ton of gameplay issues attached to it.<BR>### Yes. And Tunare's Request was supposed to <BR>### address that request, but if failed miserably.<BR> Keep in mind that the main drawback to charm is the fact that the animal will be angry at the caster after the spell fades. <BR>### Yes, but that's not the only drawback.  There<BR>### are many drawbacks to charm, which is why it <BR>### is seldom used.  These include resist rate,<BR>### random duration, limited pool of targets,<BR>### level caps, and of course, giving a high level<BR>### pet to someone not used to using a pet.<BR>Taking that aggro factor out would require some other serious drawbacks or limitations to the spell,<BR>### I agree, which is why I urge you not to change<BR>### charm.  If players want a non agro charm make<BR>### a new line of spells, and fix Tunare's Request<BR>### Changing charm completly will make it less <BR>### useful for what it is used for now.  Temporary<BR>### crowd control in limited environments.<BR> even more than the fact that it is limited to animals. The idea of making them act like enchanter pets might be a worthwhile idea for a limitation (no ability to command the pet).<BR>### Except that an enchanter can invis and kill<BR>### their pet.  If you make it like an enchanter<BR>### pet it loses value as temporary crowd control.<BR>### especially with bugs where charmed pets will<BR>### continue to attack their old target after<BR>### charmed.  It happens quite often.<BR> From one player: "How about a High level charm animal spell that only works on animals that con kindly or amiable. If the spell works, it says "The wooly mammoth decides to join you", if it fails it says "The wooly mammoth declines your offer". That would seem to be the spirit of a druid charm animal spell.<BR>### Except there are almost no kindly or amiable<BR>### animals in the game.  Almost everything in<BR>### velious is dubious at best, most kos.  I can't<BR>### think of ANY non kos animals in Kunark.<BR>STATUS: None<P><BR>ITEM: New Druid Rings.<P>DESCRIPTION: New rings would require redoing whole zones to get graphics in for them.<BR>### Ports only require rings for roleplaying<BR>### purposes.  Gfey, and Lfey already have rings<BR> But some of these ideas might be feasible, especially if we consider a high concentration of trees enough of a nature focus for a druid to travel to. <BR>### more roleplaying reasons. Since when has role<BR>### playing concerns ever stopped a change to the<BR>### game?<BR>Perhaps giving druids access to rings in Surefall Glade, Greater Fay (both of which are druid starting cities, and G Fay already has a ring), Warslik Woods, or perhaps Lesser Fay would make travel easier for them.<BR>### Gfey or Lfey would be fine, don't need both<BR>### Preferably Gfey.  WSW and SFGare a must<BR>### though, West<BR>### antonica is barren for this reason.  So is<BR>### Northern Kunark.  <BR> These locations make a lot of sense from a story integrity standpoint, the issue here is does it make sense from a gameplay viewpoint.<BR>### Gfey gives druids quick access to the <BR>### Mercantile center of many servers, Fey-mart.<BR>### Warslik and Surefall ports would help <BR>### revitalize underused areas of the game.<P>### You also forgot Kunark evacs.  There is a rut<BR>### between karnors and the dreads ring.  Please<BR>### make them castable from anywhere, or at least<BR>### anywhere in kunark.  <BR>### Also there's the issue of a Dragon who is agro<BR>### to 90% of players sitting at the Wakenling <BR>### Lands ring, and the lack of any evacs<BR>### In velious.<P>STATUS: None<P>ITEM: Spirit of Wolf – II.<P>DESCRIPTION: A faster Spirit of the Wolf.<BR>### Mobs would get this spell too, and since Mobs<BR>### can cast this in dungeons, unless the upgrade<BR>### was castable by players in dungeons as well<BR>### it would be more of a bane than a boon.<P>STATUS: None<P><BR>ITEM: New Appearances.<P>DESCRIPTION: Druids are one of those classes that are often stuck looking like newbies until fairly late in their careers. Nobody is expecting new armors and textures to be made up right away, but it should be considered when the next set of new textures is made.<BR>### This should have been looked at a long time<BR>### ago, back when class armor was introduced.<BR>### This is fluff, please don't bother with fluff<BR>### until the PROBLEMS are fixed.  No one is<BR>### against new druid looks, but not at the <BR>### expense of important issues.<P>STATUS: None<P>ITEM: Vermiculated Armor.<P>DESCRIPTION: The claim is that this armor is too heavy for druid specific armor.<BR>### It's heavier than indicolite, and gives far<BR>### less strength to counter this weight. Elder<BR>### Spiritist is also quite heavy for its limited<BR>### protection.  This however is a minor issue,<BR>### we're not being turned away by groups because<BR>### our armor is too heavy.  Might want to check<BR>### drop rates on Vermiculated as well, I saw 2 <BR>### pieces in 27 hours, neither would anyone in <BR>### their right mind wear (boots+arms) and the<BR>### arms were off of a phobo.<BR>### Druids are a popular class and their armor <BR>### Drops at around one third the rate of non<BR>### popular classes.<P>STATUS: None<P><BR>ITEM: Elder Spiritist Boots.<P>DESCRIPTION: These boots require a component to use their effect. It's certainly not traditional that items should require a component ( unless it is supposed to be a severely limited item), and it partially negates the utility of the item.<BR>### This is a level 14 spell.  It costs 30 mana.<BR>### There is virtually no mana saved by casting<BR>### off of these boots.  Given the difficulty<BR>### in obtaining these (Mortiferous Protector<BR>### in Drusella's room in HS iirc), the low level<BR>### of the spell, and what we give up to wear them<BR>### (9wis in most cases) I don't think removing <BR>### the batwing component from these would over<BR>### power them.<BR>### Also, please look at ES gaunts. They cast a<BR>### level one spell. Level 1.  Please consider<BR>### changing this to our level 29 snare.  It<BR>### is not a mana savings, and it's not a spell<BR>### slot savings as most people still keep ensnare<BR>### mem'd for its duration.<P>STATUS: None<P><BR>ITEM: Quad Kiting.<P>DESCRIPTION: Because this is a balance issue, it should be looked at. Is this something that characters should be able to do? The two classes that seem to be able to do this are wizards and druids. Perhaps the tactic is hard and time consuming and should be left as is.<P>### I commented on this earlier<BR>STATUS: None<P>ITEM: Emotes for Wolf Form.<P>DESCRIPTION: It would be very cool if there were some animated emotes for characters in wolf form. Wag, sit, howl… stuff like that.<BR>### FLUFF. Who suggested this and why did it get<BR>### on the list but not something like kunark <BR>### evacs? /howl off would be nice, but it would<BR>### still be fluff.<P>STATUS: None<P>ITEM: The 55th level pet.<P>DESCRIPTION: Assuming that this pet is primarily just for looks and has little combat value, perhaps we could reduce the casting cost a bit. 600 mana seems like a lot.<BR>### A cheap worthless spell is still a worthless<BR>### spell.<P>STATUS: None<P>ITEM: Succor and Egress.<P>DESCRIPTION: It appears that these spells do not clear aggro properly. The main problem seems to be with continuing damage effects (like DoTs) that cause the creature to re-aggro on someone after they have escaped across the zone.<BR>### it is not a matter of dots. whether mobs are <BR>### dotted or not it does not matter. It doesn't<BR>### clear agro, it either creates a massive<BR>### train, or your group gets summoned back one<BR>### by one.  Also egress is ODO, is this as<BR>### as intended? Why is it inferior to the Wizard<BR>### version?  And please check the safety of the<BR>### "safe points" in zones and post when they've<BR>### been changed.<BR>### If egress was indoor castable, and both <BR>### cleared agro like CoH I wouldn't mind the mana<BR>### drain, but when you have to drain yourself <BR>### just to port yourself to a dungeon entrance<BR>### it is annoying.<BR>STATUS: None<P>ITEM: Fizzling Spells.<P>DESCRIPTION: These are the spells that seem to fizzle too much: Breath of Ro, Circle of Summer, Circle of Winter and Superior Heal.<BR>### Hit the nail on the head.  Please look at <BR>### all classes fizzles as well.<BR>STATUS: None<P>ITEM: Beguile Plants.<P>DESCRIPTION: In a fashion similar to Defoliate, this spell is highly limited by the small number of creatures that are actually labeled as plants.<BR>### This spell needs so much work to be made <BR>### useful it should even be on the list.  <BR>### Maybe .01% of all mobs in the game are plants.<BR>### maybe 10% of those are within the level cap of<BR>### this spell.  Really just fluff, please make<BR>### something useless useful, not something <BR>### useless but for different reasons.<BR>STATUS: None<P>ITEM: Ro’s Fiery Sundering.<P>DESCRIPTION: Players don't think the scroll for this spell drops frequently enough.<BR>### I paid 5k for this spell, worth every copper.<BR>### would like to see a higher level version of <BR>### this spell, or maybe a version that doesn't<BR>### draw agro quite so much.  I use this before I<BR>### have to nuke.  Being almost guaranteed full<BR>### damage is worth the 50 mana if I need to chain<BR>### nuke, but with a warrior tank this alone <BR>### usually pulls agro.  I like that it's unresist<BR>### able. Thanks.<BR>### Also, 55+ drop rates are also a little low.<BR>### As one druid said there are more copies of <BR>### the Naturewalker's Scimitar on their server<BR>### than regrowth of the grove.  That spell is <BR>### entirely too rare, and having to offer 30k+ to<BR>### get a copy is insane.  The same holds true <BR>### for many other classes.<BR>STATUS: None<P>ITEM: Group Treeform.<P>STATUS: A group version of the Treeform spell.<BR>### Oh come on, the one fluff spell we actually<BR>### asked for is a no go?  a coding problem?<BR>### a gameplay problem? or a roleplay problem/<BR>STATUS: N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item.<P>Ok.. and now for what you missed.<P>Wolf form -- A group version upgrade usable indoors, and a self only version usable indoors, with a USEFUL effect.  +atk on group wolf, +wis or mana regen on the indoor.  Something to compare<BR>to Bearform and Boon of the Garou which muscled in<BR>on druid territory (animal forms, and group illusions)<P>Treantform -- Tree form that lets us move, even at a snared pace.  More fluff than anything, but since fluff seems to be a major component of the list, might as well add this too.<P>Skin like XXX -- These spells are later level than the cleric line and never, ever, EVER get cast if a cleric is available and no more than one spell rank below the druid.  They cost too much for their effect.  We pay nearly 3x the mana for some minor regeneration.

Something like raising them to 1 or 2 points lower (or higher) than the single target version would be preferable.<P>Druid epic -- FEYDEDAR. Please look into this.

Bard's have a monopoly on this sort of thing, and a spell that makes them faster is not a class defining trait.  Selo's Accelerando is a class defining trait.  We've always been the fastest, and should always be the fastest.

</FONT><HR>Most of the items on the final list have very little to do with the balance of the class post 50, where most of the conern is.  Obviously, the healing changes on test are important, however, I don't think it may be enough in a grouping or raiding environment.  Additional solo power is not needed, so suggestions about Sow II really aren't necessary to balance the class.  The following are a few items that would help out the class in a group or raid:<P>1)  Stacking of the Skin line of spells with the Cleric Hero line.  The Shaman Talisman spell stacks and so should ours.  With the inflation of mob hps and difficulty in Kunark and SoV I really don't see this as unbalacing to the PvE portion of the game and also helps out with Druid desirablity on raids as an additional buffer.  As it stands now, a ranger can outbuff (Call of Earth and Strength of Nature) a druid on a raid as clerics are always on raids and overwrite most of our buffs.  If it is viewed as being unbalanced for lower level PvE then an alterantive suggestion would be to allow them to stack beginning with the lvl 49 spell Skin Like Nature and above.<P>2)  I accept my back up healing status in a group, clerics reign supreme here as they should. Appropriately, it takes a shaman or druid more mana to heal the tank than a cleric.  This is fine.  The one problem I see here is mana regeneration, which is the absolute key to dungeon crawling. (mana regen dictates the pace at which a group can kill)  In addition to clarity/clarity 2 buff, a shaman can increase his mana thru Cannabolize to help offset the additional mana he neads to act as a back up healer ( a great line of spells which should not be given to anyone else), while inside a druid has no such assistance.  Suggestion is to allow the post 50 druid wolf forms to be cast indoors.  Those wolfforms have a small mana regen component that stacks with clarity.  The problem with this is the spell then effectively becomes an indoor castable self only sow.  I am not sure what solutions to this are appropriate or even possible, so will leave it up to additional comments from both a balancing perspective and a coding one.  (i.e. is that an unbalacing factor and if yes, is it possible to code to remove the sow effect when cast indoors)<P>3)  Prior to 53, as a high level druid, I pretty much had four spell slots permanently memmed with lvl 34 or below spells. (ensnare, greater healing, fury of the sky (a great addition), and spirit of the Wolf) In a dungeon take out sow for an evac and the principle remains the same. All of these are great spells, but it just seems odd that even post 50 we so heavily rely on lower level spells.  This point is more of an observation as I have not in detail reveiwed the spell lists for other casters to see if it is the same for them, but it just seems odd to me.  This situation changes when we get to 53 (soon 51) with superior heal, but perhaps an upgrade to Fury of the Sky is also in order.  My suggestion would be to have a longer stun effect, but there may be several ways to upgrade the spell.  <P>Well that is all that I can think of, and perhaps my suggestions are way off based, as always your mileage may vary.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have read through most of the posts.<P>I am firmly in the "Don't want any fluff, would rather be useful in a group post 50" camp and so here are my ideas in order of preference...<P>1.  Increase Ro's Fiery Sundering drop rate.  From what I have read those druids with Ro's Fiery Sundering are effective on major raids as they are capable of dropping the epic mobs FR enough to land some nukes.  Ro's Sundering is resisted much like a lure so it is actually capable of being landed on these mobs.  Excellent.  Great design.  Now let us have the spell.<P>2.   Healing.  The current changes seem ok to me with two exceptions...<BR>     Move Superior Heal down to 49 so that it can be cast on everyone in the game.<BR>     Give pack regen and pack chloro a 15 minute duration.  If you have to up the mana cost somewhat to compensate, then so be it.<P>3.   Buffs.  As has been stated many times above we are third in line as healers (behind Shamans and Clerics) and fourth or fifth in buffs.  Allow me to add my voice to the "give us some useful buffs that stack with clerical buffs" outcry.  My suggestions... <BR>Make the coat series usable on other people.  Go ahead and up the mana cost if you have to.  It's a nice AC buff coupled with a small damage shield that stacks with anything.  Give it some other minor ability (small ATK buff or the like) to make it truly unique and let it go.  I do not think that another HP buff is going to sit with Verant as the number of HPs a tank can get is already huge.<BR>Drop the mana cost of the skin series.  Why does this cost two to three times as much as the corresponding clerical buff?<P>4.  More druid port destinations.  Would be fun but not needed for group usefulness.  WW and Surefall Glade are the two I agree with most.<P>5.  Vermiculated weight.  Not really of help in gruoping but I agree that it's weight is out of line with the other planar armors.<P>6.  Quad Kiting.  Good god yes, nerf the damn thing.  I started quad kiting finally at 50 as I was having problems finding a group (no big surprise there).  That was four weeks ago.  I am nor one yellow bubble from 54.  That is too powerful.  Nerf it.  Someone earlier suggested putting a +- 5 percent on the snare speed reduction.  Not enough to keep it from being useful for anything other than quad kiting but enough to make quad kiting useless.  I heartily agree.  A very elegant solution.  Just make sure you do that to ALL snare spells/songs, no matter the class.<P>Other than the above I think Druids are more than fine.  Giving us some more group useful abilities while reducing our one soloing ability that ticks off everyone else strikes me as a good deal.<P>Thund Yertewtall<BR>Lvl 53.8 Druid<BR>Cazic Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A CLERIC'S PERSPECTIVE:<P>     I just wanted to touch on the superior healing and a higher level healing spell for later in the 50's comments I have read here.  The reason many clerics are so defensive about others getting better heal spells or heal spells at a lower level is because in general clerics feel that by playing a cleric they are choosing a very focussed class.  A cleric cannot melee at all once in his 40's, some would argue in his 30's.  We hit for 1pt or 10 pts and that is all.  We don't really do anything but heal, AC+HP buff, and Rez.  Now many classes can buff, and some can heal.  Granted they cannot compete with a cleric at the higher levels, but that is the point.  If Druids were to get superior healing earlier than is being talked about by verant, what would clerics really be great at?  We are not a jack of all trades class.  I may have gotten CH at 39 I think it was, maybe 34 but I would not use it until I was close to 44.  It just costs WAY too much mana to use b4 then.  In a short time all mana is gone.  So I shelved it until I was into my 40's.  That meant my top heal spell being used was Sup Healing until close to 44.  Now, we can't give Druids sup heal at 44 or thereabouts because it would mean a very small difference in healing effectiveness between the classes.  At the high levels, the only thing that makes us special is healing and rezzing with an occasional buff thrown in.  People did not choose to play a class to be special at something like Rezzing only...it is very important to keep a LARGE difference between the healing abilities of the cleric (main healer) and any other classes who would be considered (secondary healers).  Otherwise, clerics have spent all this time to be nothing more than Rez machines. And one last point, someone stated they didn't understand why paladins get vs undead spells.... well they are half cleric =P and we rule the undead =))<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hehe do I have to keep on posting here  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>SoW II<P>Personally I thing you should stop asking for this. We wont get it and frankly  we dont need it. Furtheremore its clouding more important issues. BTW Our form of the great wolf is already significantly faster than SoW but I never used it for the speed increase anyway.<P>Healing<P>To the clerics raising concerns about druids starting to replace them as healers I can only say dont worry. You have obviously never played a druid. First of all there is more to cleric healing abilities than meet the eye. At 53 with superior heal I cant heal anywhere near as good as a 53 cleric even if we for the sake of test both decide to only use superior heal. I think I saw it mentioned somewhere that clerics gets a hidden build in boost to healing witch would explain this observation.<P>Secondly dont pretend to be mid 50s clerics and tell me that most clerics dont even use CH. CH is so efficient at higher levels that frankly it should never have3 entered the game. Yesterday I was grouped with a 54 ogre war. He had 4800 hps buffed and that is at 54 ! Our cleric could consistantly CH the war for 3500-4000 hps without running any real risks. Let me see that would take me 7-8 superior heals. No wait - I cant even fire 8 superior heals with a full mana load.<P>Clerics you have 2 of the 3 best spells in the game so quit pretending to be worried for your position.<P>Agro     &lt;IMPORTANT PLEASE READ&gt;<P>Absor here is something you should remember to bring to the tuning team. I will not pretend to know how agro works but I do know for a fact that Druids have an agro problem well above their damage output.<P>Again if I group with a cleric of the same level and if for the sake of test we use the same healing spell (superieor heal) then the cleric can heal more times and earlier than I without being agroed. <P>Another effect of the same problem is that I cant use my best dot(s) in a grouping situation and then medditate. (Witch would have been my only way to be an effective damage dealer).<P>Do I even have to mention what happends if it is also my job to snare. Snare must be coded to work like taunt.<P>Yesterday I were lucky enough (for a druid :P) to get in the Captain group in Karnors. The captain popped while I was low mana so all I did was run the dot from my arms (only 400 dmg over 1 min) at 90 pct, health and then snare the mob at 40 pct health. It aggroed me ????? By this time the warrior and rogue must have been well above 1000 pts of dmg each.<P>My only explanation is that the mobs have a go for the easy victim code (low AC/low defence/low hps?). Whatever it is please look into it.<P>Perhaps it could give you some insight as to why rangers get the aggro in a group where the warrior outdamage them  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">    <P>Resurection<P>Again I am tempted to ask you all to even stop asking for this. We wont get it and its clouding the important issues. However I do have to say that the suggested 80 pct outdoor only rez at 60 is more in character for druids than paladins current 80 pct rez.<P>Teleports<P>Yes of course Verant should add some teleport places near zones that are currently not being used enough. But again even if done this does NOTHING to the group abilities of a druid and it will be just as much a benifit for the other classes we port around the world as for the druids themselves.<P>Bari Eagleeye<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Two additional thoughts based on what I've seen here.  <P>First:<P>Item: SoW2  <P>Instead of creating an entirely new line of SoW (which shaman should also get, of course), why not make some changes to Spirit of Cheetah to make it usable again?   This would require increasing the duration (to 1 minute, for example), and decreasing the recast time (to 30 seconds, perhaps).<P>The second item is one that I have seen here for the first time:<P>ITEM: Bond of the Land/Pact of the Land<P>DESCRIPTION:  Single and Group form of an anti-summoning/anti-gating spell.  It causes the recipient to be able to resist being summoned or gated away by magical means for a moderate period of time (e.g., 3 minutes).  The protection could be absolute, or a function of the recipient's level and magic resistance.  <P>It would affect the following spells/effects:  Gate, all group gates, all evacuation spells, succor, egress, Call of Hero, monster summoning.  <P>This spell would be very useful for high level groups, and both forms should be 55+ spells (the group form should probably be level 60).   Mob summoning has greatly expanded with Velious to become a common ability for many areas, and as a common mob ability, players should have some means of countering it.  When even the "yard trash" are summoning, the reasons why summoning were put into the game no longer really apply....<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Can you at least make this Skin Like Nature? It won't be too over powering, as we do have an upgrade to this spell, and by levels it takes to kill Venril Sathir, 99% of the clerics will have the Hero line spells by then. <P>Succors in RoK to be anywhere, not just dungeons. And a port to Surefall Glade, or around there. <P>Fizzle rates on Sup Heal to be lowered.<P>Change the spawn habits of Fayd (or clone) to be a triggered spawn, such as the one for clerics in Naggy's lair. Also, the effect on the epic won't be used very often, as it takes 3 minutes to do the full damage of the dot. In most situations (grouping) the mob is dead in less then one minute.<P>57 Preserver<BR>&lt;Avatars of Discord&gt;<BR>Rodcet Nife<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Who cares about emotes in wolf form, or treant form, or even a better sow.  None of this stuff will get me a group.  The only reason why people want me in a group right now is because i can cast group regen and group wolf form.  My buffs are lousy and when i get a cleric in my group, I never buff anyone but myself.  With a shaman in my group, my other spells (regen, str, and sow) are worthless cause the shaman can normally do them better.  So why would a class that Verent wants to make more group friendly want a "wag your tail" emote??  That is a waste of time.  I think the trolls on the board got the better of Verent and Verent listened to the dumb ideas.  <P>All druids want is a better use in groups.  Hell, at lvl 39 clerics get cheal...and then there is me, casting a 250 point heal that can barely fill one bubble of my tanks life.  Superior heal to 44 please...then I'll have more of a use at 44 then just a porter to the farther reaches of Velious.<P>Oh, and on the subject of porting...please make the Kunark evacs ports.  There are not rings there, but druids can evac there anyway...so what is this talk about redoing whole zones to put in rings.  And let me stress this...Druids do not need a Gfay port.  We have two good ones to Faydwer...BB and Steamfont.  So what if you have to run for 5 mins from BB to Gfay, it's not that big of a deal.  The problem comes in Qeynos.  I have to run like 35 mins to get there, be it to help a friend or just to go play around in Blackburrow or Permafrost.  What is the point?  Almost every point in EQ has a close by druid or Wizard port but Qeynos and Halas.  Surefall Glade is a perfect spot for a druid port...and I'm sure a wizard port in Qeynos Hills could be worked out too.<P>And one last thing...if mobs can cast SoW indoors, why can we?

I seriousy doubt Verant will go for another HP buff as tank HPs are high enough already.  what this gives us is a unique buff (AC/Small Damage Shield/Small ATK) that would stack with everything else and make us useful.  This, combined with better healing and Ro's Fiery Sundering dropping regularly, should make us effective in a group, especially if we get the mana cost of the skin line dropped.<P>Thund Yertewtall<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Have you guys looked at the changes for other classes? I have looked at the Cleric, Necro, and Enchanter. For starters, I think that Enchanters don't need much else, they are balanced or even a bit overpowered as it is. Being only level 35, when in a group, the common saying is "<BR>/shout 35 group looking for another member<BR>/g I hope we get a chanter,"<BR>That is common... now I could be wrong about them post 50 but from looking at them right now, they seem to not need balancing to get in a group. Now clerics. First thing on the list: STANDING MED so they can Melee. For starters, does this mean running as well, if so, I can just hear an uprisign happening.... YAY we can wag our tails while the cleric melees and meds! Necros are in roughly the same situation as druids, a primarly soloing class, great in groups as backup but never the primary want of a group. <BR>Heres a list of what different classes bring into groups:<P>Enchanter: Clarity, Stun, Slow/Aug, Mez<BR>Shaman: Sow, heals, Buffing<BR>Warrior: Big HP and good DM<BR>Ranger: High DM but low def so not as good tank<BR>Pally: Med DM and med Def(to my knowledge)<BR>SK <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">not going to comment for fear of saying miss information, I am going to read up on them in a bit)<BR>Rogue: Great BS damage, not as good tank but nice for quick nice DM, also have trap skills which are usefull.<BR>Wiz: Powerfull Nuker, has learned to control their nukes well,<BR>MAge: Nice DM nukes and DM shield, pet is also a +<BR>Monk: Fast nice DM and feign death is nice for pulls.<BR>Cleric: Complete heal, Resolution line, Resurect exp, Other Buffs, Standing med(mabye) and lifeblood of group.<BR>Necro: Pet is nice for extra DM, dots are cool, Mana sharing is nice.<P><BR>(I am only writing what is not above cause I am pointing out unique things that are brought to a group that makes them wanted)<BR>Druid:... umm <BR>1. Ports(unfortunatly no exp for ports :-)   )<BR>2. Evaks(shared with Wizard though)<BR>3. Group Wolf form(outside, this is a cool line but not usefull for dungeons which is where all the exp and phat lewt seems to be)<BR>4. Snare(though others classes get a version.) <P>Now I could be wrong on my analysis, I am only 34, but I read the posts from a lot of forums and it seems that Druids, +50, are still not going to be wanted in a group for EXP, and on raids, all we do is get people out after(unless there is enough wiz's to do the job). Druids need to get a totaly UNIQUE, not shared by any other class(even ranger) spell that makes us A. wanted in groups, B. makes us Unique!<P><BR>An idea might be different forms:<BR>1. Griffon(Lev, ultravision, Sweet Damage Stat +'s)<P>2. Bear(More Sta, STR but lower Dex and Slower)<P>3. Raptor(should be an animal)(Fast speed, high attack rating, Dex and Agi +'s)<P>4. LEsser Dragon form(dragons are lizards, which are animals, technically), This could be a class defining outdoor spell, to show the ultimate achievement of a druid, they can be somthing like a Shardworm or somthing.....)<P>In books like Dragon Lance, and Forgotten realms, Druids have the ability to change shapes into many forms of animals, this ability should prob be passed on into EQ. I am not talking about giving druids illusions for everything, that would take away from Enchanter unique ness, and we don't even need group forms of these forms, but adding these would make us unique, Especially if you added them to be indoor and outdoor(doubtful but would help even more)......<P>Give me your thoughts or Flame me, I am just trying to help out my class. <P>Shaeria Wisperwolf<BR>35 druid of Terris Thule<P>ps. WHERE IS THE mid-level class armor promised in Feb 2000??? I am still waiting but soon I won't be midlevel anymore!   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I posted this under druid talk before I found this section. <P>I've been playing a druid for over a year now. I've had very few problems with the class and I enjoy it. I do feel very limited though. When I'm indoors I sacrafice a great deal of my abilities. I lose my nukes based on magic and basicly am stuck with fire which seems most mobs have the best resist to. Since Verant's position has clearly been stated that they want people in dungeons my abilities will always be hampered if I want to group. <BR>I would really like to see Dizzying Wind and Whirling Wind have the outdoor only use removed. Since at lower levels its the only spells we have that can interrupt a caster. Since they have a long refresh time they aren't overly powerfull. I would love to see a continuation of this line. Perhaps a level 39 and 49 upgades to these spells.<P>Level 49 lightning blast is a great spell. I've not had a lot of resists with it and many times will use it as a straight nuke for a single target if I'm getting resisted on other spells. I can easly justify to myself sacraficing some effecincy just to get a nuke to land. I single target nuke that worked indoors and had the same kind of mana/damage ratio would be a nice addition at 44. If your in SolB as a druid below 49 you don't have Ice which means you can't nuke most anything. Sometimes calefaction works but I wouldn't count on it.<P>Really though some nuke more magic based is really what druids need. Yes the top two items would cover it and give druids the extra strength they need to add to a group in a dungeon w/o them hedgeing into the territory of other casters. Those afore mentioned items also won't give druids anything to help solo, since you normally dot,snare root or quad kite.<P>On another note, somethings that have always bothered me. Other classes debuffs spell icon have a red background and usually the symbol is flipped. Like the necro spell Siphon Strength. The arm is turned around on the spell gem and icon and the icon has a red background to show it's harmfull. Snare and Ensnare look just like sow. I remember where I put what spell but it would be nice if the boot was turned around and if you did snare yourself you had a backward boot w/ a red back ground.<P>Another thing is our summon light source spells. Since the items are simply light stones could they have the nodrop portion removed? They are nice little things to hand to blind humans and erudites. Most druids can see in the dark as is (cept them pesky humans ones, bah!  j/k) so I can't imagine that whole line of spells was created just for the human druid. As they are just light stones and no rent to boot it wouldn't infringe too much on a magician if I could hand one to someone lost in the dark.<P><BR>Bordia Ironwood &lt;CLAW&gt;<BR>Xegony<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Please increase the range of the group spells. I want to use the group regen spell, even though it costs more to cast, and has a much shorter duration, because over time it will save a little mana.<P>But as it stands now, the group members practically have to be right on top of you to get the effect. For these sorts of group spells, that are already balanced by having a higher mana cost and shorter duration, could you please increase the range to a normal healing spell range?<P>I realize that these talks are about class-balance, but I think it is fair to mention things that I consider to be broken or not working properly. It may be the class is balanced *because* a given spell is broken or not working properly, but is that how you want to balance the classes?<P>Thanks for your attention, Absor.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Now that I've caught up on all the posts here, I can say this:<P>There's a lot of concern about 50+ groupings. However, please note that not all of us are 50+ and the pre-50 issues should be addressed with as much importance as the post-50 issues. Keeping the class interesting and practical is important for people looking for a new class. The Qeynos-area TP issue is, to me, extremely important. I haven't been to Qeynos in MONTHS because I just don't want or need to run there. It would be nice to go to Halas again now that I'm a higher level, but I don't see the need for it. The same goes for a Kunark and Velious self-only TP spell. Why can't we TP ourselves to the Combines or Velious before 34?<P>On healing - it's hard for me to address specific post-40 group issues since I'm only 31. However, I think that healing should be fixed, or as stated above, give druids something unique so that they'll be as necessary for it as clerics are for healing. Group shield/magic resistance, speed, etc. SOMETHING. I'm worried now that as I get higher as a druid, I'm going to be less desirable for groupings. I see more 50+ wizzies than druids, that's for sure.<P>Mike<BR>Talisaar - 31 Druid - Xegony<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>PLEASE DO NOT MESS WITH QUAD KITING IN ANY WAY!<P>Here is a slant on the value of quad kiting that I have not seen mentioned yet:  It gives those of us who only have 1-2 hours per day to play something to do in this game.<P>At level 35 I was ready to quit EQ because there was little left to do that did not require a full group or even multiple groups.   For someone whose real life obligations prevent them from playing a computer game for more than 1-2 hours per day (and I suspect there are a LOT of people in this category) getting into a full "well oiled" group is often too time consuming - by the time the group  is organized, often your playtime is over.<P>Then I tried quad kiting.  WOW!  All of a sudden there was something to do solo that was fun, rewarding, and still had an element of danger (an agro'ing fifth mob can ruin your day.  You may not die, but all of your time/mana invested in the kite can quickly go out the window - and remember - when you are a 1-2 hour per day player, time is PRECIOUS).  Now I can jump online no matter how much time I have to play and know there is at least something I can do that provides some advancement and wealth building.  I still much prefer grouping, and try to get into a group first when I know I can be online for two hours, but if a group isn't readily at hand, or if I can only play for an hour, quad kiting gives me something to do that leaves me feeling like I accomplished something with my game time.<P>The day quad kiting is nerfed will be the day that I sadly log onto the account screen and press cancel.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>the fact that losing quad kiting is enough for you to delete your character proves in my mind that quad kiting is broken.  People have spent much time saying that no one class should be necessary to a group or that no one item should be necessary to an encounter.  I believe that no one tactic should be necessary to a player.<P>Learning quad kiting more than doubled my experience.  I can hold down more spawns than an entire group just a couple levels below me.  It's TOO powerful.  Rootdotting, normal kiting and other tactics enable druids to solo.  Quad kiting enable them to solo at a sick rate and serves to tick off all the other classes.<P>Basically people are clamoring that they want Druids to be more useful in a group.  For that to happen while balance is maintained a Druid's soloing ability must be dropped.  Quad kiting is the logical place to do this.<P>Please note that the above is only my opinion.<P>thund Yertewtall<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Why all this about quad kiting?  It is not easy to learn to do properly.  It is very dangerous.  And even after you learn how to do this it still is not safe.  Root, snare and dot one mab is still way safer.  Its the nerf to dots that made quad kiting so big.  Unnerf the dots and folks will quit quad kiting, since it not as safe and with dots unnerfed not as efficient.  Mages soloing with pets is way safer. And don't even talk about a necro soloing.  So whats the problem?<P>The problem that should be address is how to make druids more group friendly.  Make our buffs stack with cleric buffs like shammy ones do.  Ours stack with shammy buffs why not clerics?  Make our spells effective against boss mobs on big raids so we have something to do.  (This goes for shammy, mages, and necros too)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One of the items I don't see mentioned in the thread is that soloing is more mana effecient for me when I'm the main healer.  I can solo a mob with less mana than it takes to keep the tanks alive if they're fighting the same mob.  Not very encouraging to group when my downtime is increased and my reward is decreased.  Even if I'm fortunate enough to get in a group with clarity, I find this to often be the case.  As a level 49 druid that actually enjoys grouping, I can honestly say that the argument of less downtime in groups is not true when I am the only healer.  Even with 2 the downtime is questionable.  Fear kiting is valid, but if no one can land a fear, then it's back to barely keeping the tanks alive long enought to win a fight.  I don't think better healing would unbalance us as a class and it would make us want to group for exp rather than solo.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I was just thinking about what I said above with the different forms..... not to damand but if they were group forms of these(not dragon, that needs to be soly druid) then druids would be wanted! Prob this group of forms could, without much in the way of overhead for the global_char.s3d could make the druid class A. Wanted in groups again   B. Help out all classes.... we are "Natures Wrath" , and being her wrath, she sould grants us the ability to use the form of her creatures to impose that wrath.... I am trying to stress as much as possible that druids DON't WANT THE ENCHANTERS JOB! you are still, and always will be the masters of illusions, but Griffon, Bear, Raptor, and Dragon form would not impose on you at all....

I'm 54 now and really don't quad that much anymore but on weeknights when I only have an hour or two to play, quading at raps is a nice option. I prefer to group and do that almost exculsively on the weekends. Most of the my druid friends who quad do so while LFG.

</FONT><HR>Im just writting to exprees my concern about Faydedar, the "dragon" that roams timorous deep. Ive heard horror stories about camping him for 300-400 hours of camp. Most have resorted to making a dummy char to sit in Fayds Fayds roaming path, turn computers volume up alot, and go do something else. This seems to be an odd requirement for an epic quest. Clerics get a controlled spawn mob, Rogues have a nightly spawn for thier ending mob. I see rogues and clerics out there with epics ALL the time, you rarly see druid, necro, or bards epics really, dunno the story about that. I think the epic quests should tweaked so all classes have access to these mobs and such. If your thinking have fayd a controlled spawn? and what about loot drops? Look at clerics Ragefire, hes drops 2-3 COF normally. while fayd drops a spell or 2 and some other items no one wants? Unfair really. Even then, you could make Fayd a controled spawn with ONLY the druid component. Just a thought. I saw this subject ALOT more than new wolf emotes in the talks. This and druids ability to heal is the only thing that should be changed in my opinion.<P><BR> Klorii Diamondhart 59th Druid of Tarrew Marr<P>PS back me up fellow druids and epic seekers</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi JDLogan.  Thanks for your comments.    <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>First let me say, I never stated that healing should be our only debatable issue.  As a matter of fact, I do state at the end that it isnt.  Also, it is not my intent to down play anyones request/desires here.  I, like everyone, am just voicing my concerns.  <P>What I intend to express here is that personally, I can get over having to run from NK to Queynos or porting to Toxx going to Erudin and taking the boat to there, in comparison to the inability to heal.  I didn't ask to be equal to the Cleric when it comes to healing.  By the mere fact that we get the line of spells at a level later than they do suggest that we don't have their healing abilities.  I will continue to propose that we get Superior Healing at 39, something at 49 and finally Complete Healing at around 58.  Clerics get Complete Healing at 39.  They also get other healing buffs and spells after, which I am not requesting.  What I simply say is that we are healers and as such, we should be able to do so and be proficient at it.  Granting us Superior Healing ... another Healing ... Complete Healing  does not infringe on what the Clerics do.  Clerics have a host of other spells/abilities that we don't have and that I am not advocating that we get.  A change of this sort would also end the fizzle because there would be some sort of continuation of use of the healing line.<P>I agree to some extent, that if I put a buff on a player that is higher than someone elses buff, mine should overwrite.  However, Clerics make use of some very expensive gems to cast some of their awesome buffs and it only makes sense to me that I can't overwrite them.  I also don't feel that the Druid buffs level for level, should overpower the Clerics line of buffs.  Clerics are higher in the Priesthood than Druids.  I love our buffs, but I sometimes seek out Clerics when I solo for buffing and don't mind doing so.  The Cleric line of buffs seem to me to go hand in hand with their continued line of healing and their summoning line.  I do get requests for buffing, and I am not unhappy in that area..personally.  What I suggested in a reply a day earlier to set Druids apart is a damage shield that works on the same order as lay on hands.  I also suggest that Druids, like other classes get party/group spells earlier.<P>Certainly I would like to see other changes, but I think some of them pale in comparison to the issue of healing and giving us something that gives us Priestly status.  I was just as disappointed as everyone else when I got my gatorscale leggins and they look just like the patchwork leggins...hehe  -or- when I ported into the dreadlands and had to run across the zone getting attacked by some chicken, but the melee's do it all the time and they can't make themselves invisible (speaking of which...where is the group camoflage spell???).  <P>All I am suggesting here is that we put the ducks in a row.  As we advance in leveling of course the list changes.  However, to me right now when I line them up, it looks like this:<P>1. What characteristic makes me a Priest?<BR>The Clerics have Res..The Paladins have Lay on Hands? The Druids have?<BR>2. Why can't I heal?<BR>3. Where are my spells?<BR>4. Party/Group spells?<BR> <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Druids:<P><BR>ITEM: Healing.<P>DESCRIPTION: There is a general consensus that clerics are the only useful healers past 50th level. Shamans and Druids are supposed to be secondary healers. But post 50 their spells are too inferior and fizzle too often to be effective as healers at all. Some suggestions are to move Superior Heal to level 51 (and reduce its fizzle rate) and/or add in a new one at 56th. Where shamans might be able to use Torpor to fulfill their healing needs, we may need to make a new spell for druids at that level. We also need to be careful not to make them too good at healing. That’s the cleric’s turf. Whatever is done here should also be done with shaman, in some similar fashion (though probably not the same way).<P>STATUS: None<P><BR>Looking at the current status of the spells that are being considered.<P>Level 60 Heal should be 400m/1200 heal at 5.5 secs, its a Level 60 spell darnet, these mobs that attack us Quad for 850 + at 5.5 secs its basically a barely useful spell.<P>Level 55 Clorablast is fine as is.<P>As for fizzle Rate: 51 probably won't do much but reduce it by 1 fizzle.<P>One thing most do not see is a Cleric that heals gets attacked, a cleric protects himself with High AC and DA and DB. Which we are not going to see.<BR>---<P>ITEM: Charm Animals.<P>DESCRIPTION: Druids like the idea of being able to charm pets without making them angry. But this has a ton of gameplay issues attached to it. Keep in mind that the main drawback to charm is the fact that the animal will be angry at the caster after the spell fades. Taking that aggro factor out would require some other serious drawbacks or limitations to the spell, even more than the fact that it is limited to animals. The idea of making them act like enchanter pets might be a worthwhile idea for a limitation (no ability to command the pet). From one player: "How about a High level charm animal spell that only works on animals that con kindly or amiable. If the spell works, it says "The wooly mammoth decides to join you", if it fails it says "The wooly mammoth declines your offer". That would seem to be the spirit of a druid charm animal spell.<P>STATUS: None<P><BR>Charming creatures has been and will always be a limited ability. Tunares Request is 55th level with a 35th level cap. In other words its as useless as the 55 pet. See the connection?  Our high-level charm spell doesn't work pass 56, its highly resisted and fast to let go. 100 Charisma is helpful but it's an all or nothing deal. Charming is a limited crowd control, in limited situations. The spell line should be removed from the game and replaced with a pet series that is suitable for the druid class.<BR>---<P>ITEM: New Druid Rings.<P>DESCRIPTION: New rings would require redoing whole zones to get graphics in for them. But some of these ideas might be feasible, especially if we consider a high concentration of trees enough of a nature focus for a druid to travel to. Perhaps giving druids access to rings in Surefall Glade, Greater Fay (both of which are druid starting cities, and G Fay already has a ring), Warslik Woods, or perhaps Lesser Fay would make travel easier for them. These locations make a lot of sense from a story integrity standpoint, the issue here is does it make sense from a gameplay viewpoint.<P>STATUS: None<P><BR>Kunark Winds of the North and South being only Kunark dungeons was a serious waste of time to code Kunark Dungeons only. Release them to all areas. Use the current Shaman Port to Everfrost. Make it a quest spell. War Silk Woods should have a ring - no special art or guards needed. Translocate should be in the Druid Spell book, its not an alter plane, but should be a higher level then the Wizards.<BR>---<P>ITEM: Spirit of Wolf – II.<P>DESCRIPTION: A faster Spirit of the Wolf.<P>STATUS: None<P><BR>Bards are not the Masters of Speed.. thx flash, SoW II should be in the game at High Levels. Selo's is  based on Level + Item (drum) = Speed. Cheeta can't even stay up at 115% speed boost. Travel Song = Invis/Selo's. I say Selo's is upwards to 125% of speed +, Making a SoW 2 that allows us to Invis and Travel Fast doesn't effect the game, since Players are already reaching speeds that break the sound barrier.<BR>---<P>ITEM: New Appearances.<P>DESCRIPTION: Druids are one of those classes that are often stuck looking like newbies until fairly late in their careers. Nobody is expecting new armors and textures to be made up right away, but it should be considered when the next set of new textures is made.<P>STATUS: None<P>Right now, I have been to Sleeper, ToV, PoG, Western Waste. I have seen huge amount armor and items for Chain + Classes. These items I drool over and only wish that I could wear some of these items. The game has become more of a Melee + Heal ( Hack and Slash ) and not contributing to each class equally.. The drops RNG needs worked on if there is more out there. I seen spear after spear drop in Sleeper.. and worst is when you see a cloth Cap drop.. (this means something is broken). Please fix this so Druids have a unique look and not this Quest Armor pansy look. (thx went off a bit)<P>---<P>ITEM: Vermiculated Armor.<P>DESCRIPTION: The claim is that this armor is too heavy for druid specific armor.<P>STATUS: None<P>This has been discussed 1 million times over. Now my current items are laced with Str and not Agil because of all the whining about how heavy it is. I have with my spells 179 str. I really don't need all this strength, Work on something more important.<P>---<P>ITEM: Elder Spiritist Boots.<P>DESCRIPTION: These boots require a component to use their effect. It's certainly not traditional that items should require a component ( unless it is supposed to be a severely limited item), and it partially negates the utility of the item.<P>STATUS: None<P>I agree with this totally. Should not require a component. I would probably take the boots out of the bank and actual use them. 2 sec cast needs to be implimented.<P>---<P>ITEM: Quad Kiting.<P>DESCRIPTION: Because this is a balance issue, it should be looked at. Is this something that characters should be able to do? The two classes that seem to be able to do this are wizards and druids. Perhaps the tactic is hard and time consuming and should be left as is.<P>STATUS: None<P><BR>Quad Kiting is new after Kunark, basically more items had higher wisdom and higher mana, so it was possible to do such a feat. I don't see a problem with it since the "group experience" has been modified to enable you to gain more in a group then on your own.<BR>---<P>ITEM: Emotes for Wolf Form.<P>DESCRIPTION: It would be very cool if there were some animated emotes for characters in wolf form. Wag, sit, howl… stuff like that.<P>STATUS: None<P>Sorry this is Silly, Rather see indoor wolf then make my Tail wag, I am not a dog darnet!<P>---<P>ITEM: The 55th level pet.<P>DESCRIPTION: Assuming that this pet is primarily just for looks and has little combat value, perhaps we could reduce the casting cost a bit. 600 mana seems like a lot.<P>STATUS: None<P>Waste of Time, pet was given to Druids to shut us up.. They know that we know that, all casters have a pet, though most are useless and a waste of coding the only reason we got a "Behest" was to squash the argument that all non-melee classes have a pet, we being "jack of all trades" cannot conjure a pet. It was purely a slap in the face.<BR>---<P>ITEM: Succor and Egress.<P>DESCRIPTION: It appears that these spells do not clear aggro properly. The main problem seems to be with continuing damage effects (like DoTs) that cause the creature to re-aggro on someone after they have escaped across the zone.<P>STATUS: None<P>No Comment.<P>---<P>ITEM: Tunare’s Request.<P>DESCRIPTION: Players seem to think that this spell should also clear the aggro list, and that it does not. If it does not, then it seems to be a worse spell than the lower level version.<P>STATUS: None<P><BR>Tunare's Request works as intended, it does clear aggro. Problem is - people charm KoS animals and expect it to walk away. Back off from the mob and the pet even tho charm let go.. will fight to the death, if your out of Aggro range. This is my exp with it, if its broke or random, maybe Testers need to look at it.<BR>---<P>ITEM: Fizzling Spells.<P>DESCRIPTION: These are the spells that seem to fizzle too much: Breath of Ro, Circle of Summer, Circle of Winter and Superior Heal.<P>STATUS: None<P>Yea fizzles are getting bad, I fizzle spells that I am "specialized" in and they are 10 - 50 levels below me. SoW fizzles and I am level 60, its a pain and shouldn't be so. In PvP my spells land for 66%, melee has no penalty.  Why should I have a penalty at level 60 for fizzling? Fizzles from my understanding is like a "Melee Missing a hit" I do not believe at level 60 we should fizzle so much. Last night, I casted Regrowth of the Grove, and Fizzled 3 times in a row, at 900 mana loss right before a battle, that hurt a lot and was really really irritating. Fix this! Ever Fizzle Protection of the Glades twice in a row?? 1200 mana a pop = I just lost 1200 mana total on 2 fizzles then when I casted it, I used another 1200 mana.<P>---<P>ITEM: Beguile Plants.<P>DESCRIPTION: In a fashion similar to Defoliate, this spell is highly limited by the small number of creatures that are actually labeled as plants.<P>STATUS: None<P>Yea Beguile was a waste of a quest. Will not do anything for me, nor ever be a useful spell, Remove it.<P>---<P>ITEM: Scale of Wolf and Spirit of Scale.<P>DESCRIPTION: These spells drops pretty easily and very few people ever use it.<P>STATUS: None<P>Been playing with Scale of Wolf, Spirit of Scale, speed is a bit faster but not really useful. Basically makes it so I can travel a bit faster in a non-kos zone. <BR>---<P>ITEM: Ro’s Fiery Sundering.<P>DESCRIPTION: Players don't think the scroll for this spell drops frequently enough.<P>STATUS: None<P>Oh it drops a lot guys, you just not looking in the right places. Get out a bit these spells shouldn't just be handed to you.<P>---<P>ITEM: Group Treeform.<P>STATUS: A group version of the Treeform spell.<P>STATUS: N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item.<P>Stop! God Group Treeform!???  We have Group Regens, Group Cloro's, Group Regrowths! If you were gonna ask for anything, Ask for a Group Clorablast. Wake up please!<P>As for Druids, The heals are really gonna be something to get used to since I don't have the protection of a Cleric Invul spells. <P>They have stated that no Lure DD's would be given to Druids. I would look into a Lure based DoT that actual lands on mobs that have these Huge HPs, Level 60 Quest Spell would be appropriate. <P>Resist rate on our Epic is horrible, and due to the speed of cast its basically useless unless your gonna root a green mob then cast it. I say lower the cast time keep resist rate, or make the resist rate like a Druid DoT and keep the time. Make it Useful, I worked my tushi off to get this weapon.<P>Rain spells resist horribly, Big mobs they don't' even land, fix this please.<P>Ice Line and Lightening Line useless when dealing with uber mobs, or even blue mobs, yellow or red mobs while in a group, no lure means no hit. Little more sugar for lure based DoT ( high damage ).<P>As for the druids asking for Wolf forms to be different colors, this has been slashed due to the fact PvP exist on some servers. Color indicates level. I rather see an indoor wolf form.<P>Mask of Hunter: Remove the OUTDOOR only Tag please, there is no reason for this to be outdoor only.<P>High Level Spells that can only be Quested. Unique and if you don't quest them, you don't get them! This should be for every casting class. Faction shouldn't be a question. These should originate by the original GM of that character.<P>My last request is this. Though many disagree, I would like to see +50 Skin line stack with +50 Cleric Bravery Line in Velious only. With Mobs having ultra hit-points, Casters/Priest not gonna see any increase in HPs or AC like all the Melee's are getting, its really unbalancing on our side. <P>I am not a casual player, I play my character in the most of demanding circumstances. I consider myself a smart player and I love playing my druid, though recently with the changes in Velious of this becoming more of a Melee/Resist/Heal game.. Spell Damage has been ignored and a concentration on healing Melee has come alive. I don't know if Everquest will recover from this, and hope changes are going to happen. Please put aside your likes and dislikes for this or that class, in the end we all work together... (sorry I support x-teamers), its about getting things done, having fun, finishing quest, low or high level ones.<P>Sobe Silvertree<BR>Hierophant<BR>Mith Marr<BR>Afterlife<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I really like the idea of being able to permanently charm an animal and it behave like an enchanter pet.  Kinda like the Beastmaster, who says  “ I do not command the animals.  I am their friend, and they are mine, and sometimes they help me, sometimes they do not. ” <P>So animals have their own will, the charm spell merely acts as a request for them to follow you.  What they choose to do to assist you is their own choice, therefore the druid cannot command them. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
