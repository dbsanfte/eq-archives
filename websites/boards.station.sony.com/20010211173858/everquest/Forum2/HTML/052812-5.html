</FONT><HR>First off let me start this by saying I started playing EQ because of the monk class. I missed the monk from 1st edition D&D so when I heard EQ had them I was there from the day EQ was released. A monk is my main character.<P>I think monks WT limit should be raised by like a point every 2 lvls after 20 or 25. Work it out so it comes out to about what it's at now for higher lvls.<P>I don’t think monks should need to rely on weapons so much. We are monks our fists are our primary weapons but I rarely if ever see a monk without a weapon. I started a monk because I didn't want to spend my time trying to get the next better weapon, that’s a warrior’s job. A monk is a monk naked with no weapons in his hands. A fighter/warrior is a lost soul with out his armor and his weapons, and I honestly feel more like a warrior right now, more so then a monk. <P>Why does 1 and 2 hand blunt cap higher then our H2H? I notice that our double attack is lvl+1 x 7. Why not do the same thing with H2H.<P>Give us clothing (notice I don't say armor) that makes our Attk go up.<P>I see a lot of monks trading in armor, clothing, and jewelry, for armor with better AC again I think this is wrong. A monk shouldn't need armor with good AC (heck most of the time in movies we see the martial artist ripping off articles or clothing rather then putting them on) a monk should be just as hard to hit naked, as with armor on. In fact I think armor should hinder a monks AC. Give us some clothing that (I hate to put it this way) but that has an insane amount of agi and dex. This would help us hit more and get hit less. <P>I’m not nor do I want to be as good as warriors or do as much damage as rouges or any of that what I want to do is play a true monk. Do monks use weapons? YES. Do monks need to rely on them? NO. Do they in EQ? It seems so to me. I know I do more damage with my Trance Stick and Essence of Dol then I do with my hands and feet. I look at it in the 3rd Edition D&D way does my monk carry weapons? Yup, he got 2 nunchucks. Does he use them nope because his nunchucks will never do as much damage as his fists. The damage on your fists goes up 4 lvls the damage on weapons always stays the same. So I chose my fists above my weapons almost every time. Why do I carry weapons you ask? Cuz sometimes its cool to whip out a pair a chucks and kick some ass. Now it’s mostly just for effect that I pull out weapons.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello. Warrior here. I do agree with monks in that you should be doing more damage than warriors in a group situation but not as much as rogues (they only can from behind). You already do a bit more damage than warriors I think but a 10-15% increase would be about reasonable. I remember before Kunark when monks were far ahead of warriors in damage.<P>On the other hand though, if you should be getting that 10-15% increase in damage, your epic and robe of the whistling fists haste should be nerfed (well toned down a bit). Free Celerity is too good. I'm level 60, and my monk friend at 55 with epic fists is an even match for me in a duel. As I said he's using epic fists, I'm using a jade mace and lamentation. Both using FBSS for haste item. I have close to 100 more AC and 1400 more hitpoints, but it's still a close fight. 10-15% more haste and I'd lose bad! No I don't think dueling is completely indicative of class balance, but a level 55 melee being an even match for a level 60 melee (no epic but still comparable items) is a bit unbalancing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Epic Gloves...<P>I don't have these gloves first hand, because im only lvl 30 but here is my thoughts on them.  I think they are a nice piece except, compare it to other weapons, now what do you think of it?  Not so good eh?  Maybe giving the fists critical hits, and or crippling blows would help a ton.<P>Have weight reducing bag quests for only monks.  Make them from the guild leaders.  Have it layed out this way.  Just like the headbands which are completed after you reach a certain level, maybe a 25% reducer at lvl 10, 50% reducer at 30, 100% reducer at 50 all with 0.0 stone.  <P>Also coin can become pretty heavy in mass quanity, I know there is a bag out there to reduce the weight of them, but I have never seen one or most people never even heard of it.  Sounds like its going to cost 50k.  Maybe have the bag quest reduce your coin weight a little also?<P>Lastly, Human monks should have something iksar don't.  Im not saying nerf iksar, but maybe add something to make them a little more balanced.  Maybe give Humans a resistance bonus? Higher weight limit 14&gt;20?  I don't know what the reason was for letting iksar be monks, but I think Humans should of been the only race to be them.<P>Also my biggest concern is this thing about monks having to be low weight.  lets look at the defensve skills a monk and warrior have.<P>Monk - Block, Dodge, Riposte<BR>War  - Parry, Dodge, Riposte<P>Parry and block are the same skills.  Ive seen tests where they go off the same % of the time.  Now, a 100 stone war is not as agile as a 10 stone monk, so why do we have the same skills?  Give monks Parry also.  After all Parry is used with a weapon correct?  Well I don't see any monks without weapons now a day's even if they have the epic.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Whatever you decide please think about those of us who probably will never make 50th level. I've been playing since august of 99, and have finally made 38th level.<P>The recent weight gain that 55 and 60 level characters get is great but I think it should be target at 35 and 45 so that the bulk of the monks can take advantage of it.<P>Please make the Treant Fist something that compares to the time it takes to get the item.<P>The sashes and headbands should have AC and stats comparable to the shackels. <P>I also think that the robe and celestial fists quests shouldn't swallow our prized posessions.  It just adds to the camping of the rare spawns by higher level characters.<P>Please remove the robe from Brother Zephyl and Qwinn. It only emphasizes even more that the larger guilds get the goods for the least amount of work.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A few changes I am really in favor of (one broad change it in order for all classes and this change will balance most classes to a point instantly)<P>Broad change to the game.<P>STOP NERFING OR DIRECTLY DESTROYING THE BEST INATE CLASS ABILITIES!!!!<P>I will say it again, so you can get a picture of it and put it on every developers desk and wall.<P>STOP NERFING OR DIRECTLY DESTROYING THE BEST INATE CLASS ABILITIES!!!!<P>There, simply put for monks, they have 3 or 4 defining charactistics that are utterly defining.<P>I) The ability to outdamage every melee class in toe to toe combat, except for a back stabbing rogue. <P>//Problem, They no longer do this, even with the epic, a decently hasted warrior wielding a 13/20 weapon can now outdamage a monk easily at the highest lvls in the game. This problem occurs because of poor testing (something that is a mantra with Verant, hell I will test for you if you are that desperate fo people with a clue), and unavailability of Exceptional monk weapons and no addition of monk usable weapons when the bar is raised again, and again with new content. <P>2)Damage can be returned in a few manners, <BR>  a)Unlink the monk special attacks so they are not greyed out when you use another one, or just unlink the punch style from the kick style.<P>  b)Create some attainable monk weapons that are better than weapons used by other melee classes (for instance there is very little comparison to a wurmslayer by any monk usable weapon, for lvls 1-55)<P>  c)Give the epic weapon a real advantage. Currently you can get the same effect with a Jade mace as the monk epic with only some really good equipment and a lazy haste spell by a lvl 35 enchanter.<P>II) Feign death.<BR>  a)outside of using the attack button, this skill is "THE" monk skill. It is utterly class defining, yet code has been put in again and again to nerf this ability, and monks are not the only ones to have their MAIN abilities screwed over.<P>  b)Change your paradim for "Breaking" the main abilities of classes when people are good at using them. This is my NUMBER #1 complaint with EQ, this just sets people up for utter disappointment, and when you nerf 1 of 2 defining abilities, you basically make that class a worse subset of the parent class (warrior).<P>Other than these 2 major changes that NEED to be implemented. The class is doing fairly well. However, there are some legit points to be made by others on Armor choice and how the highest lvl armor stinks, and we are still using stuff from our 30s in the late 50's.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think the one thing that would make a monk slightly better in a group is some attacks that would work kinda like a bash and interrupt spells.  <P>Another thing i have noticed and ive read a few posts is the FD bug, and the posts didnt seem too great so i'll try to clarify.  FD doesnt seem to work (even if it is a successful feign) while auto-attack is on.  I've found that when either solo'ing or grouping it works the same way, you have to turn auto-attack off first, which is just an inconvenience, im not sure if its actually bugged or not though</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First off I would like to say I love my monk and have for the past 48 levels.  <P>I was dissapointed however when monks had to become reliant on armor to compete with their counterparts.  I can live with that though because warriors and rogues must get good armor and weaponry to become viable so why shouldn't monks.  But there are still some of us out there that would like to be able to use our fists so my suggestion is this:  Make an NPC much like the priest of discord that you can hand your <BR>weapon(s) into that will make you a pair of gloves with the exact same stats as on your weapon.  You could make it so that you would place the weapon in a certain container to make it off hand or primary and if you didn't have a second weapon you the gloves would be the stats of the weapon and the stats of your fists at that time.  You would have to return to the npc every 5 levels or so that your fist damage had increased or you had gotten a new weapon to change them in.<P>And Absor if you read this you should really take Zadikels/Bodi Kibadachi's post on the second page to heart.  It has my complete support.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Personally, I think most are off base with asking for monks to fall between rogues and warriors.<P>Why, you ask?<P>Well, rogues are the masters of stealth, not damage.  Even if the damage is situational, rogues should not be outdamaging monks--supposed to be the Masters of Melee damage.  I submit that rogues should be situationally matching us, and normally falling between us and warriors.<P>Rogues don't have to deal with the weight restriction, meaning they have much, much wider selection available to them in terms of Armor and Weaponry. <BR>They get other abililties that make them desirable, though as yet, the need is not well implemented--such as open locks & sense/disarm traps.  As content is added to the game, these skills will only continue to grow in importance.<P>It seems to me that this makes rogues a little overpowered, though not at the moment due to poor implementation of some of those skills.  They should not, however, be the highest melee damaging class in the game--That is why I started a monk in the first place.<P>As a side note.  True it may be that rogues are the Master's of stealth, but could Monks also get a message for sneak, and possibly get the Hide/Sneak combo?  I don't want the ultimate ability of rogues to be invis to both undead and the living at the same time, but stealth is very much a factor of body control.  I believe we should approach rogues stealth ability, just as rogues should approach our damage ability.<P><BR>And yes..... 10lbs on a monk only weapon is just plain bad planning.  You want to make stuff weigh a pound or 2 to make us plan our equipment and make sacrifices, fine.  But 10 of our 14lbs?  That is a bit much.  Weight eliminating Bags, or at least fixing the Mage/Shaman LD bag poof issue would go a LOOOONG way to helping this.  It would be nicley balancing to make all summoned weightless bags weigh 2lbs per slot and no drop upon Ld--Thus requiring a new bag--rather than have it eat my heavy (6.5!!) staff that I am trying to store for the moment.  This facet of the summoned bags hits monks the hardest right behind the Magicians who actually summon them because we are the only ones that have the weight limit of 14 lbs.<P>Just my 2cp..  don't spend it all at once   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>--Sakassis Grimscale, Ikky Monk.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here are a couple ideas I didn't see in previous posts.  <P>1) Dodge for Monks should work on creatures hitting us from behind.  I think this would be consistent with the idea of a class that is supposed to have a heightened awareness of its surroundings.  Given that other classes have high AC that works when being hit from any direction, this ability would help balance monks in relation to other melee classes.<P>2) A 0.0 weight container that has 10 slots and holds only keys.  This item should be fairly easily obtainable by a level 35 player either from a merchant (suggested retail 200pp) or a quest.  <P>Given increased usage of keys with Kunark and now especially with ports in Velious, Monks are saddled with a burden most classes don't have because of the 14.0 weight limit.  Basically when my monk goes out to adventure, he is at about 11.0 weight.  He could easily add another bag to carry keys, but adding a 6 slot Large Tailored Belt Pouch at 0.6 weight means that instead of being able to loot 3.0 weight worth of coins or items, he can only loot 2.4 weight worth. That's a 20% loss! In more practical terms that is a loss of 24 coins.<P>Personally I wouldn't care if this item were available to all races and classes since the primary purpose is to reduce the impact that carrying keys around has on the monk class.<P>=====<BR>I'd also like to add my support to the Zad/Bodi post.<BR>=====<BR>A couple of things to emphasize are<BR>1) STUN STUN STUN STUN.  Seriously if a caster can be interrupted by a bash, a good swift kick in the...uh stomach...should have a chance to interrupt them as well.  As it is monks have very little ability to deal with casters other than pure resistance. <P>2) FD needs to work much much better.  I think there should be a time and/or distance limit on re-agro.  It only makes sense that if something thinks you are dead, it shouldn't come running back after you along with a trainful of buddies from half a zone away.  <P>I still don't understand the reason for 'nerfing' feign death and feign pulling.  I hope in your summation of this thread you can either explain the reason for changing it or at least point to a link that addresses the reasons why.  Given the choice these days of a monk and a warrior or 2 warriors, I can't think of a reason why a high level group in Velious would pick the monk/warrior combination over 2 warriors.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm only a 19th level Monk, but he is my main character.  I never intend to get to the uber level.  Here is feedback from a casual Monk.  It is based on the 2 things I think of when I think of Monks:<P>From European Middle Ages monasticism:  <BR>1) Place a garden plot by each Monk guild.  Allow Monks to cultivate (forage) vegetables and grapes there.<BR>2) Deep burgundy Raw Silk and a deep burgundy Cured Silk Gi.  A mantle that looks like a mantle.  Monk only!  (Are casters offended when I don't thank them for Clarity/Breeze?)<BR>3) Ability to solo better.  I should be able to handle something that /cons blue.  If I can't touch it, make it /con white or yellow.<P>From Japanese Middle Ages Ninja-hood:<BR>1) Run while Sneaking at night.  Even let us run at SoW speed for the first 10 seconds after Sneak is pressed at night.<BR>2) Black silk Ninja armor.  Not a robe, but silk wrappings.  Obtainable at lower levels--not uber armor.<BR>3) Jump 15 ft into the air.  Maybe cycle with Mend like ID cycles with Tiger Claw.<P>One more thing.  I would like to be able to spar with those two Monks in the Ashen Order yard for increasing my 1HB and 2HB which I have neglected since level 2.  Make them dish out reasonable damage but mem-wipe them once they hit you if you are wearing one of the Sashes of Order.<P>I love Monks.  I don't care if they are underpowered; it's part of the challenge.  Of course, I'm on a high because I just got FD last weekend and it's saved my life over and over already.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Should take me a good few hours to read most of this so let me put my 4 things in order of how important they are to me:<P>1) Evade type ability, bottom line, I shouldn't have to not be hasted and switch to a slow 2hd weapon to live through a big fight.<P>2) Make flying kick somewhat like backstab in that it becomes more damaging as level increases. At level 55 still getting a 3pt flying kick is just an insult when minimum BS for a 50 rogue is significantly higher.<P>3) Thunderkick, honestly, if you aren't going to replace it with something usefull, just get rid of it and stop insulting monks with this kind of jokeish garbage. I don't mean to be rude but thunderkick is the biggest crock of sh*t Verant has pulled on monks since the FD changes.<P>4) Stuns: I'm sick to death of getting my butt burnt to the ground by stupid greenie mobs because I can hit 4 times in a round plus a kick for 100 and it'll cast right through me like I'm some kind of sock puppet. If the mob is 30 bloody levels below me, why in the hell can't I interrupt it? I mean seriously, its just stupid.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I admit these 'chain attack' ideas are pretty interesting but it's not realistic and would make us totally unbalanced..<P>Some of the things I do think would rock?<P>1) Special attacks interrupt <P>Stun seems nice but the only real reason I would need it is stunning gaters as they seem to all have 255 channeling and never interrupt unless our ogre warrior bashes them<P>2) Added and spread out weight increase.<P>lvl 30 - Weight increases by 1 pound.<BR>lvl 50 - weight increases by 1 pound.<BR>lvl 51+ - Weight increases by 1 pound each level.<P>I don't think this is so much to ask for. It would help the mid-level players out but obviously it would still be a minor increase, but useful.<P>3) Lighter weapons<P>Pre-kunark I had no problems staying under weight because monks didn't use weapons. Once kunark was released I found myself striving to stay under weight while being forced to use the obscene 10.0 weight tranquil staff just to compete with damage of warriors/rogues of equal level.<P>I didn't mind the idea of using weapons but damn, why do they all have to be so freaking heavy?<P>I was forced to trade off my tranquil staff for better light armor because it dropped my AC to a whopping 880.<P>4) Monk only coin purse!<P>Not sure if this is even possible but I would like to see a quest for a coin pouch or something that was monk only and reduced all coin weight to 0.0<P>Because I have problems staying under weight I rarely loot, this becomes a problem because trade is my only source of plat income which means the fewer /randoms I win - the less bandages I can buy ;/<P>5) FIX LOOT SPLIT!!!!<P>Make it so all of the group CHOOSES if they want cash from a split meaning that /autosplit would turn off INCOMING SPLITS rather than outgoing.<P>As it is now whoever loots gets the cash and if they have /autosplit turned on they share with the group.<P>This shouldn't be so, /autosplit should choose whether or not you take a split which means as a monk, if I had my auto split off and everyone had theirs on; whenever they looted something they would get the split but I wouldn't.<P>Destroying copper, gold, and silver every 4 seconds gets increddibly old and annoying and it seems every time I ask people to turn off their auto split there is always some moron in the group who does a /split 0 0 0 9999 just to try and be funny.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR> I would like to see the damage from all the special attacks go up with levels. That way we could still use the old ones like round kick etc.<BR> I would also like to see combos of the differant attacks- punch,punch,kick that sort of thing.<BR> More types of armour and weapons.Some of those ninja style weapons would be nice- the ball-chain ans sickle thing etc.<BR> More low level stuff. This applies to all classes<BR>Being a casual player, I will never get to the higher levels and get all the great stuff.I'm not asking for super weapons, but more styles of things so we can customise our looks a bit more.<BR>Rusty swords look the same as ones that are not etc.<BR> I agree that monks should have a weight limit but<BR>make it so we can carry a little more than food and a light source.Why is it that magic casters<BR>are supposed to be the weakest in str. yet they can carry 6 times the weight than a person that spends his life training to be strong and fit?<BR> I don't know... just some of my thoughts.<BR>Thank you if you read this far into my post.<BR>Cheers,</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am a 17th level monk, and I know nothing of the higher level tribulations. I do know that I get wiped up alot of the time by blue mobs, and obliterated by whites. I know that white mobs should be an even fight, but I get smoked. Hit percentage seems a little low, after all, isn't the idea to hit faster rather than harder? Perhaps a quicker mend after 20 or 30. That would help with the downtime we tend to suffer after getting thrashed by a blue caiman or a chain-casting Desert Madman. Stun. I'll say it again. Stun. Why does a round kick to the chops, or a tiger strike to the solar plexus not break casting? This makes no sense. Monks are supposed to be bada$$ fighters with no weapons or armor. AC/ATK bonuses for higher levels. As I am 17, I don't know if they exist, but they should. As the monk masters his/her body and technique, it just makes sense that AC/ATK would go up. Dodge/Block. Have these work a bit more often, or allow us to specialize in one at 20. What about a judo flip or throw? Again, that could do a stun.  We shouldn't have to have weapons to be the master fighters we should be. Yes, we can use them, but it is innately more satisfying to whup something with the weapons Quellious gave us. Our own bodies.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Monks are pretty much helpless on PvP server vs same level casters unless you are a twink..    No thanks  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>     Please institute a functional FEIGN DEATH that works vs Player Characters...  I know you cant fake out a fellow human being playing at their keyboard but if a monk feigns successfully, then they are unnattackable  or untargetable.... <BR>   Feign should definitely wipe targeting not in group for pvp servers rallos zek, tallon zek and Vallon Zek (WOOT!),   <P>    These issues should not affect the non-pvp servers that are the majority of the servers but this would make gameplay more enjoyable on the PvP servers and more balanced also....<BR>    I dont see why these changes shouldnt accompany whatever overall changes you make for the monk in the PvE environment<BR>                        Grimas Bloodyfang<BR>                        Dark Resolution<BR>                        Vallon Zak<P>              The Dark Will Rule!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
