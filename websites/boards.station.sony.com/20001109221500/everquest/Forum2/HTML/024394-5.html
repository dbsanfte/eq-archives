</FONT><HR>Yep keep on being a player first, we NEED someone who'll look at things as a player (customer) would.  We need someone to remind EQLive team that the game should be fun as well as challengeing.  Just dropping in lvl 55+ mobs with 32k hp, hit for 250+, and summon about the landscape is not exactly creative...   Last thing we need is someone who says they dont have time to play EQ much and then tell us there is nothing wrong with spawn times or camping times, or everythings hunky dory for casual players with full time jobs and social lives.  EQ shouldnt be fun at high levels for no-life underemployed mole people....  <P>Dont want to be a "EQTrekkie" of the 21st century</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Friggin' children. I look forward to reading your "Ive ben baned by verant for no reson!" post in the next few days, Kayan. Because you DESERVE to be banned for your baseless, ignorant flame. 90% of the EQ community hates Abashi, is it? I guess that's why the overwhelming majority of the posts here are of the congratulatory kind for Gordan.<P>I really don't understand why some people really seem to dislike Abashi. I mean, it's pretty obvious from your post Kayan that you don't like Gordan. So I ask you ... why? Step back for a second and rationalize to yourself where this anger comes from. Abashi did his job. You didn't like the way he did his job. Fair enough. Post here saying that. But WHAT RIGHT do you have to come here and insult the man? You pays your $10 a month so you now have the right to disregard the feelings of another human? My advice to you Kayan ... grow up. Quickly. And get rid of that holier than thou attitude, cuz it'll get you slapped down one day.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>"You must live an incredibly sheltered life to think anything he ever said was nasty. Has anyone -actually- been rude to you?"<P>So if he's not as rude as, oh, let's say, Denis Leary, he's not rude at all? Way to make the most ineffectual argument I've ever seen. Abashi has been abrasive and - it appears to me (Quest Box incident) - actively malicious at times. (This isn't a flame, see the end of the post for my explanation).<P>"As for ignorant, well, I guess you might see him that way if you expect him to have played EVERY CLASS TO 60!"<P>I'm hardly an uber-player, but myself and my older brother (who plays and reads even less about EQ than I do) have a working knowledge of Everquest that completly engulfs that of Abashi. The number of posts that are downright stupid over the years amazes me. I can look through archives and smack my forehead in disgust and yell "D'OH!" at the monitor at some of the elementary errors made, some of the faux pas's (!), some of the complete bloopers... gah!!<P>Abashi is NOT a bad guy. He was just not suited for this environment or this job. I think the flaming eventually did get to him and his attitude noticeably changed earlier this year. Do not misconstrue this as a "VERDANT SUX!1!" post, since it's not. I'm merely pointing out that I am glad the job has been handed on.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Advice to Absor;<P>Blanket statements are BAD.  If someone from the team comes to you with a prepared statement reading, "All of these quests are thoroughly tested and working properly." and demands that you post it without *knowing* that they are in fact tested and working, just don't do it.<P>Run screaming instead.<P>Don't wait until the next week when you have to inform the same people that the team is adjusting one of those quests for being 'too easy' or the week after when another one has to be fixed because an NPC doesn't spawn but a bunch of nekkid floating chicks do instead or the week after that when you are forced to admit that THREE of them STILL aren't working and that the stats for one of them seem to be wimpy compared to the others and may have been bloody FORGOTTEN when the items were reviewed...<P>Remember when someone says 'we tested every option exhaustively' that translates to 'we glossed over the code once at Pizza Hut and have no clue what it looks like live, but it *should* work.  We plan on coding it live about 2 weeks after you announce that it is already active...'<P>Don't let anyone pressure you into that position.  Gordon let them do it to him and his credibility has been sorely tarnished by the people misinforming him about doing their <BR>'thorough testing' and then telling him to repeat that (obvious) untruth to us.<P>[Come now, I like a LOT of what Verant has done, their game world is the richest I have ever experienced, but did *anyone* not cringe when Gordon said that?  Did *anyone* not KNOW instantly that there would be problems?  I mean we all are breathing the same air right?  Or is someone getting a purer mixture over there...]<P>Post something kinda equivocal like 'Our team has tested these Epic Quests with many dozens of race / class combinations.  Be aware that we expect many people to attempt them and find themselves stuck on various sections, our GM staff will NOT be providing hints or assistance on matters relating to the Epic Quests that are not clearly bug-related.  We hope you enjoy these quests and are pleasantly amazed at the rewards.'<P>NOTHING IS PERFECT.  If anyone tries to tell you that nothing can go wrong, consider your legal options and if you can get away with it, slap them upside the head until they go back and check again or develop a bone spur.<P>I don't agree with Gordon about 70% of the time (and the other 30% of the time I think he would be justified to show up at a posters house with a shotgun...), but I am not going to pretend he doesn't regret much the stuff he has been told  to say over the last year.  (and some of the stuff he has just shot off and said, wishing he could take it back before anyone read it...)<P>I am sure he never again wants to hear about Alchemy or Dual Wielding Pets or any of the other issues that he was *assured* were working properly when, in a few cases (first initial Fiery Avenger quest anyone?  The pre-Plane of Sky one?), they had never even been implemented in the first place, let alone tested.<P>Don't let this happen to you.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Saying 'I don't know, it is *supposed* to be working like so, how does it seem to be working on the live servers?' doesn't hurt.<P>Always expect the worst.  You won't be dissappointed, and every surprise is guaranteed to be a pleasant one (since you've already planned for the less pleasant options).<P>[and yes, that counts for the posters here, even me, expect the worst and I shall endeavor to never disappoint]   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>As for Abashi, just about anything I could honestly say might be considered a bannable offense.  Hope you are happier in your new job, we can be a stressful lot.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
