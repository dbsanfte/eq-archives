</FONT><HR>I for one, think everquest is the best game of its kind, and I think verant, sony, and the guides (who are volunteers btw) do an outstanding job.  I feel the vast(silent) majority of players feel that way.   A small minority of people troll/flame/whine on this board, and no matter how well verant manages the game those people will still exist.  I rarely read or post here because I find most of the posts garbage, I feel bad for Alan and Abashi for having to put up with it daily.   If any of the regular posters here REALLY wanted to accomplish something good, they would help the new players on the newbie zone board or offer computer tips on the Tech board, but for the most they are not intrested in helping anyone but themselves.<P>Verant... please don't remove this board or the flamers will move and infect all the other boards<P><BR>thanks<P><BR>Fadax </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ah yes, the boards...<P>I have to agree that the boards really are BAD for EQ.  The Verant haters (which play the game btw) all seem to come here and vent, and complain about their class.  To be honest, if you were to come here and read the boards, you would know the following:<P>Druids KS and ruin the game in every aspect.<BR>Wizards are worthless everywhere<BR>Mages pets suck<BR>Necros are gods<BR>Hybrids suck<BR>Warriors Suck<BR>Clerics suck<BR>Rogues are perfect<P>The problem is that the posters are not generally representative of the majority.  However, the fix would be more interaction with the real players, and this is made more difficult with the many servers.<P>Since I don't like to state problems without possible solutions, my proposal would be the equivalent of the "boss walk".  As a boss, if you want the people that work for you (not perfect analogy, but work with me) to know that you care, you walk by, talk to them, ask them questions and offer feedback.  I believe the developers/Abashi/Absors should be able to go to any server, and wander around talking to people (With their real names).  However, for obvious reasons they should not appear on the WHO list, and probably shouldn't be able to recieve tells.<P>Now, they would probably have to follow the rules of GMs, in that they won't be allowed to actually group with the players (for same reasons GMs can't) but they can talk with them during raids, find out about issues etc.<P>I think the unexpected interaction would get more exact input than these boards, simply because a huge percentage of the players just don't post here.<P>-- Fabmatil</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Despite the trash you must wade thru, the gems that appear on this board make it worthwhile to me.<BR> <BR>I will admit to coming here to vent occasionally, and to not always being as positive as I should.<BR>Be aware, however, that people post here because they are VERY involved in your world, and most of us feel this is the only place where our feedback is likely to be heard.<P>It also serves as a safety valve if one person gets slammed by the system. While I feel this does not happen nearly as frequently as people make out here, it does happen, and this serves as a last recourse when nothing else works.<P>I remember the days I played UO ( played for 18 months before switching to EQ about 3 months after EQ came out, for one very simple reason).<P>We went to Stratics (remember Spiels and Rants) and vented there and were completely ignored by the powers that ran UO. So most of us left and come to EQ, where I do feel that I am listened to. I dont always like the decisions, but I do feel that I at least was heard before the decision was made.<P>You have made some mistakes with the board (I would advocate locking the threads by obvious mental midgets immediately and letting them die out, while preserving the occasional intelligent, thoughtful, provocative posts which will lead to real improvement in your world, and ours.<P>Thanks for listening, and I will understand if I log on one day and the boards are gone.<P>Final thought, if you close this board which MOST of us use, and which you can exercise some control over, I for one will start using Everlore,or Stratics maybe, as the substitute.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I can not agree.<P>Why does it have to be either in game testing or feedback from customers?  It should be both.  There should be someone assigned to read and respond to the message board, and a team of employees that play the game on real severs.<P>Yes there is a ton of junk on any message board, but there are legitimate issues raised as well.<P>The message board also give players a voice.  I think there would be many more upset people if they felt they could not have any input on the game.  Think of some issue you would like to see change or improved in EQ, and now imagine you had no way to make that issue known.  It would lead to many very unhappy players.<P>It is still Verant's game.  The players can only voice opinions, or make suggestions.  That is it.  Verant can listen or ignore.  It is up to them, but at least players were able to give some input.  It gives players hope (maybe false hope at times) that some issue that bothers them may be addressed at some time if there is enough support for that issue.<P>There have been many great suggestions that came form players.  How long did it take for the hybrid experience penalty to get removed.  That is something I doubt would have changed without player input.  There are others, but I am not going to go through them all.<P>I do agree that there needs to be more Verant staff playing EQ, and grouping with real players or real severs, but that would take many people to do it right.  I do not think moving the one guy that monitors this board to play testing would make any difference in EQ.  It would just take away the players only contact with Verant.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>If you want to stop some of the negativity you can do it one way, limit the amount of posts a player can do in one day 1or 2. How would this help you say¡K..<P>1) Flamers are only gonna be able to flame once or twice At that why would they waste their precious posts on just making fun of someone?<BR>2) Trollers can still start arguments but people would be reluctant to stay too far off the topic that they chose to use a post on.<BR>3) Longer posts: On the upside players willing to take the time to make their posts legible and long enough to express their entire point, because of the limited number of posts, wont have to wade through all the 1 sentence crap just to find a intelligent topic being discussed with maturity.  <BR>4) If things start to become discussed with maturity then maybe, just maybe people who just want to vent steam will find another outlet. (Try PvP for a while I know for a fact that that helpsƒº)<P>Other Ideas!<P>1) Verant should be more liberal with not just board muting but they should just unlink some discussions.<BR>2) More posts by you board moderators, at least show your interested in a discussion (like you did with this one *Gives Aradune two thumbs up*)<BR>3) Don¡¦t be afraid to keep things on topic Verant. If you keep things on topic more intelligent game discussion would go on.<BR>4) Open up several more boards like Social, Complaints, ext. The hard part is getting players to post there, well if you keep discussion on topic they will have nowhere else to turn (players here should be allowed unlimited posts)<BR>5) Don¡¦t close this board, just make it deal with more game issues. I like the boards too much for you to close them and hell what else is there to do on the Internet when you can¡¦t play EQ. I haven¡¦t figured that one out yet. Sometimes I feel like I spend more time reading the boards than playing EQ.<P>Congratulations! (Positive Feedback, yes it does exist)<P>1) Everquest is the only game I have ever played that the company has constantly tweaked it, using player input as well as a little common sense, to create a game that is a thousand times better than when it was Originally released. You can complain about all you like about how they ignore issues, but you have to give them credit for taking on the daunting task of perfecting their game formula and adapting it to the player base. They try, and not only that they get things done Congrats!

There are dozens of other boards people can post on, and they have less chance of getting banned or whatever too.<P>As a matter of fact, Verant has lots of snoops among those boards keeping tabs on things, and it wouldnt surprise me to find they devote much more energy to that than to this board and its concerns.<P>I think the best thing about this board is that the people developing the competition for verant read it.

</FONT><HR>I've said basically the same thing in the past.  The theory is good, the reality is bad.<P>It would be nice to see something more in the line of a board where VI announces changes that are being implemented on the test server.  A seperate board would be available for people to post feedback, but the posters would not be able to read what anyone else had posted.  Updates could be posted as to what was discovered about the changes on Test and which portions of that would be going live.<P>Another board could provide any ongoing changes being contemplated.  It would give the players an idea of the what to expect.<P>A different board could hold a list of all previous patch messages and changes that have been made to the game.  It would be nice to look back over the history of the patches.<P>A different idea would be to have a general discussion board where each poster could post once every 12 to 24 hours.  There would still be some garbage posts, but I think people would be more particular about posting, not wanting to waste their only post (or two) of the day on a stupid troll message.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR> I would think hoff's idea was the best,keep the boards but respond to none of the posts.People can vent and give their idea's a forum that they hope Verant will read but as long as its clearly stated they will never issue a response directly to any post no one will expect any.<P> I for one believe the talk about the "vocal minority" on these boards feeling differently than people who never post here is incorrect,most pollsters would tell you that if 90% of replies to a post here are of one opinion then those in game of same class and level would feel the same plus or minus a few percentage points.Frustrations post 50 exist that do not at pre 50 which is why i say different class/levels could have dfferent views.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ok thinking a bit more about my idea of class reps here it is restated more completely:<P>If the boards are removed or closed or no longer responded to maybe verant could either appoint or elect (via login polls at server or even character selection?) an in game representative (and reelections every 6 months??)  for each class on each server.  That representative would bring to verant issues presented to them in tells or through their emails (email address provided by verant)that they felt were appropriate.  This would add a big dynamic to the game.  Your class representative would be important to you and hopefully you and your concerns would be important to him/her.  The representative might bring their input to verant via a semic public place where the conversation could be viewed by the public but not effected directly.  Finally the class reps should be on a free account and have a minimum playing time / week <P>That's the whole idea i'll probably think of 20 things to add to it in the next 5 minutes but for now that's it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>No company will ever again, thrive in isolation. Not only game companies but all companies.<P>There is a need for an avenue for customer feedback and company response. What that avenue is, doesn't matter as much as the effectiveness of responses.<P>The question that needs to be asked and answered about the boards though from Verant's perspective is...<P>Is it better to have a mechanism for customer feedback in our hands, or should we not have one and allow the customers to gravitate to a resource not under our control.<P>If these boards never started, or if they were to go away, the EQ community would find another spot to do so. Getting message boards together in this day of the internet is a small quick chore. As EQ is a grouping game, and one already needs to be logged onto the internet to play, there would be much communication ingame between customers about information and where that information was found. Also where frustrations can be posted.<P>Although, I feel the boards haven't done the job -  There are far too many simple quick questions that never get a response as the staff delves into the larger issues, but as they don't get answered via email either, there's not much of a difference - I do feel that it's better to keep a stampeding beast that is out of control close to the heart, rather than cut it free.  That'll cost money, but it's always worth the price to know your "enemy".*<P>*I use enemy as it is the saying. I'm not implying that the customers are the enemy in any manner, merely saying keep the information overload close and in your control.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I should post my one idea directly related to the boards.<P>I think this board should stay more or less as it is, but Absor (and Aradune, Abashi, etc... everyone but Auric) should move into a new board, that is completely moderated.  Auric should continue to enforce the same policies (though while we're getting used to enforcement, an explanation tag on closed posts would be nice).<P>The new board would consist only of bluename posts and responses, along with the player posts they're responding to.  Many of these posts would be directly submitted to the Moderated forum, but the blue names could, at their discretion, move posts over from this General Forum.  When wanting to post something, a player would have two choices:<P>- Post to the Moderated forum, knowing that someone (who may only make $9/hour, but someone) would definitely read it and decide whether to pass it on, but it might well never get posted.<P>- Post to the General forum, knowing that the community at large would have the opportunity to see the post, and they had a lottery-style chance of getting ported over.<P>Then if I was a bluename, I would make it my official policy to ignore any General forum posts addressed to Verant/blue names/Absor etc.  If they want to address their thoughts to you, they should post to Moderated.<P>That would have the effect of removing the attention-mongering from this board, while still keeping the amazing and unheard-of feedback we have here.  It would have the added benefit of giving everyone a much easier time to find the official word, rather than it getting drowned in the over 8,000 posts on this board right now.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

This doesn't happen to me on other EQ-related boards, just here, on "WHine-play."<P>One of the best things about EQ when it began was that no one knew the answers to anything--VERY little data was told, everything was a surprize you had to discover.  <P>I don't think that things people have already discovered should be changed A LOT, but little tuning changes are OK, however: <P>I DO think things people have NOT yet discovered should NEVER be broadcast.  The way these boards and the LOG-IN panel work now, you may as well tell us all the answers and how everything works, because the people here are parsing and disecting everything.  It really takes away all the magic of the game.<P>I agree there should be boards where people can input feedback, but like any "Office-feedback" box, you should not be able to read other's feedback, and there should be limited space on the forms.  If people have a CS complaint, they need to email or call the CS department and be routed based on the nature of the problem (i.e. technical, account related, etc.).  <P>GM's should be there to help with technical problems in game or with TOS violations, PERIOD.  They should decline all converstation involving game analysis or complaints about the nature of the game.<P>If consumers were able to affect game design such as PS2 or Super Nintendo games, static games, it would soon become a mess. <P>The dynamic nature of EQ should be unknown to the consumers, waiting to be discovered.  If I wake up one day and have a new spell for sale at my guild, woot, that would be awesome---as it is now, the whole world knows what is coming down the pike 2 months before it goes live, where to get it, what it does, how the mathematics of it work, and all the nasty, spiteful crap the posters here think about it, the CS team, the DEV team, etc.<P><BR>I would applaud shutting these boards down, and moving all game changes into a cloak of secrecy. I would NEVER tell people what changes are being made, and I would suggest making subtle evolutions to each class all the time, so NO ONE EVER KNOWS what class is better than what class from day to day (*One month the Rogue may rock on BS, but the next month it may fade a little and the SK may suddenly be hitting for more).  <P>The general nature and skills of each class would remain the same, so to the broad relative abilities.  But truly, the idea of achieving some kind of perfect balance between these classes you have made--that will never happen.<P><BR>Kelven, 52 Wiz, Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well I can say for sure that if these boards didn't exist I would have deleted my account many months ago. You can't treat MMORPG customer service like a usual game or product. It's players that MAKE the game you just provide the eonvironment.<P>The only way to sustain a game like EQ is to involve the players. Overtime players build up such a depth of knowledge the will frequently know more about certain aspects of the game than the developers. Even you admit this, e.g. the recent admission you guys were shocked when observing FoH in Sleeper's Tomb as you had no clue a small party of highly experienced players could do so much.<P>If the goal is to improve the game and make it a better experience for your customers then surely you have to listen to your customers? More importantly you have to have dialogue with your customers. Currently the boards are NOT providing an effective channel for this simply because so many posts go ignored. Of course off topic or non-constructive posts should be ignored but there are HUNDREDS of posts with important issues raised in them that go ignored. It's so pathetic that people have to name drop in titles or make the titles 'catchy' (and often misleading in the process) to get a response.<P>Even worse is when a dialogue does start and is then simply ignored later. Imagine having a debate with someone who after responding to a couple of points just disappears with the majority of questions unanswered. I can't count the number of times I've seen a great issue raised, some troll responds off-topic and then a blue name responds to the troll whilst ignoring the original poster, that isn't any way to encourage constructive dialogue.<P>The recent &lt;class&gt; Talk threads have been a disaster in terms of customer service IMO. They started great, some real dialogue discussing many of the concerns of the classes. But then suddenly something we had waited a couple of YEARS for got rushed and before we knew it we had a dozen class talks going on at once with ONE guy (Absor) supposedly still able to give each of them the time they deserved. This later transpired to be untrue, as can clearly be seen in the Necro summary thread, Absor's initial post was basically a re-hash of his initial Necro Talk post, virtually all the ideas raised in the Necro Talk were ignored. One post later to the summary thread and it seemed Absor was back on track, adding a few things to 'the list' but now he's disappeared again and the thread has petered out into a hopeless series of bumps wondering if anyone is still reading.<P>Don't get me wrong, I think by and large Absor is doing a great job. But a person can only work so many hours a day. Absor needs to have an additional CS rep PLUS a dev guy assigned to him, that way more posts can be answered and more of those with better answers than 'I don't know, I'll check on it'.<P>There are two other things I'd like to see:<P>1). The minutes of tuning meetings posted. Obviously with some 'sensitive' stuff cut out but I want to understand the thought that goes into some of the decisions that are made. Some changes seem well thought out but some are so ludicrous I really can't believe any rational thought is behind them. It would also be nice to see how player-raised issues were debated at the tuning meetings.<P>2). More direct player involvement. Either by creating a secure chat room or by having real life meetings certain invited players should be able to discuss certain issues in more depth. The selection of players would of course be difficult and may cause animosity amongst some players with charges of favouritism being laid but I still think it should be done. The invited players would change month to month so no single player would have any significant impact but key issues could be properly debated.<P>At the end of the day it is Verant's 'game' and they can choose to listen to the playerbase or they can choose to ignore them. I honestly believe though the game will only survive long-term and improve if the playerbase are involved in the development of the game. You couldn't afford to pay for the knowledge/ideas/experience the playerbase has but we offer it for free, only a fool would ignore that opportunity.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

You are right, of course, that communication is the key... but the problem here is that the "communication" on the part of VI is drowned in the clamors of the masses.  What we hear is what the players say, not the company.  How many posts have I seen saying "Verant, when will we get an official response on..." which appears between 24 hours and 10 days after an official post has been made?<P>Also, they do employ a "customer communications expert": Absor.  It is his job to represent Verant on these forums, and he was hired at least partly based on his experience communicating with people on Everquest Express.  But if that is invisible to you, it supports the notion that these boards are not "working as intended."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"Seem to me that any purveyor of good and services should be willing to have communications with its customers. Seems rather bizarre to me that anyone would even consider not communicating with customers."<P>I don't think they said they were ending communications, I think what they are taking about is improving communications. There are not many companies in the world that host a open forum for their customers to post all their BG&C's. Most companies communicate privately with their customers via email or phone, and announcements that they wish to share are posted on their website or made as press releases.<P>I guess the big difference here is, that a large percentage of the customers are not adults and they do not know how the real world operates. They are uses to being allowed to speak their mind and not be held accountable for it. If you came right down to it, Sony/Verant could most likely press charges against half the people that post on this board for slander, malicious threats, etc.. Fortunately for everyone here, the most they chose to do is warn/suspend/ban folks from their game.<P>Feel free to act like a normal company Verant, shut the board down and improve communications on the personal level. Once the players get used to nobody listening/caring about their ppetty problems, you might actually start to get some useful and positive feedback that you can use to improve your game. I also  think that if communications happen in private, all the posters that are just writing messages for effect and shock value will leave you alone, and that is a large percentage of the posters here.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First, I appreciate the intelligent discussion about the issue. And second, I will be the first to admit that I have all too often joined the ranks of the 99% moron group I originally refered to. Many seem to think that eliminating the board will be the downfall of their customer input process. Again, I have never heard of a company SO dedicated to customer feedback. I think that some energy is wasted on these boards though. I loved the idea for a 'input forum option' at the log in. The polls are a great source of customer input. And get IN GAME and check stuff out.<P>I truly believe that Verant is generally staffed with people that are in this to follow their true passion, GAMING. They love gaming. Probably most of them are old school D&D fans. Remember the post detailing the economics of the a MMPRPG? It was as I predicted, a low profit, high risk venture.<P>You want to make money, you make 'EAT ME' games for Playstation. You want job security for you and your family? You DONT go work for a MMPRPG. I bet that Verant could hire some very dedicated GAMERS that would play EQ for 40+ hours a week for modest pay and would be responsible for effective feedback. And I would bet that it would be cheaper then maintaining this board...that combined with a controlled  'input forum option' during log in could be VERY effective for no addional cost (maybe less).<P>Thanks for the input.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

We're talking a persistant game here, 24/7..not a typical RPG that you are done with in a weekend.<P>This is THEIR game?  Yes, yes it is.  So how do I fit into this equation?  They make a game and I hand them money because they made it?  No, I hand them money because it looks attractive and I want to play it.  It is their game, it will always be their game but they made it with the intent sell time and make a profit.  Unless they somehow manage to make this game without any devastating flaws and somehow manage to add content without any devastating bugs, then they will lose my 10$ a month when I have to sit here and stare at my alchemy skill never going up and never being fixed cause they just don't know. They will lose that money so many times over because they have things that just aren't fun to do.  <P>The non-MMORPG's do not do this because they are static, they have a set number of problems to fix..they asses them and release a patch, then another patch, then another and the game is shelved and a new one is started.  Every time EQ modifies something or adds something there is enormous potential for errors, can't be helped.  However, why on earth would I set through a game and constantly beta test and be victimized by rampant bugs and nothing ever be done about it.  /bug you say?  yeah...that has not worked well in the past for the people over on test.  Bugs still seem to go live no matter what they do.  I've done programming, I understand how when you make a piece of code and you know all the factors that are underneath how you think it does a certain thing.  And then you have these upstart customers tell you that you are wrong and your code is not doing what you think it is.  It's easy to disregard that input, after all..we don't see the numbers, we don't know the code.  But we DO play the game and we DO see the results.  How is this type of data to be brought to someones attention except by getting results from your whole community.  This distinguishes fact from fiction and truth from anger.  If enough people say there is a fire, their may actually be a fire.  <P>Take the recent HATE aggro changes.  The changes were made and then Verant takes the stance of stepping back and watching what happens.  Where is that input coming from?  Do you spot check 1 or 2 groups in game to see how it works and pull your data from those two points?  A chart drawn from two data points is not much of a chart when it comes to accuracy.  So how much effort does the minimal QA staff put in to see the effects of their changes?  It has been said before that 400 people on Test are just not sufficient when it comes to Game Play testing.  So if input from 400 people isn't good enough..how many people are you going to employ on your QA and how many hours will they work?  Or will QA just be dropped and whatever happens...happens?<P>The answer is obvious, a customer base will not play a game that is not fun, they will not play a game for long that is horribly and hopelessly bugged.<P>These boards..despite the greif they may cause you, are the only thing that is saving your hiney's, IMO.  You learn more from this board and its occupants than your QA dept. and Test server combined.  you know what makes us happy, you know what ticks us off.<P>It is my opinion that you do yourself great harm if you remove the boards, but hey..it's your game.  If you can remove the boards and still make me happy, I'll keep paying my 10$ and I'll play and I'll have a good time.<P>Oh, one more thing.  This board is not only our outlet to you, but it is your outlet to us.  Recently a customer posted on this board saying they were treated unfairly, etc, etc.  This angered alot of people..now what would happen if this person went to all the other boards with their stories, weather true or false.  What happens when rumors or exaggerations are spread around on other sites and fake items and postings appear that cause great damage to your game?  How are you going to tell us?  This is a way for us to hear from you and since you control the board we KNOW it is you and not a fake.<P>People say a crowd is stupid.  It is, the people who make it up are intelligent but a gathering is a dangerous thing.  However, history tells us that if you try to control this, if you try to take a crowd's voice away..it get's ugly.  This board is a control mechanism for you, you gain some measure of control over us with these boards.  To remove them is to try to attack our sources of information, I know that you have a big policy in game to restrict all knowledge.  It seems to be your motto.  We have to go to third party sites to find out what our spells do, the names don't really tell you and there is just not enough time in the world to find out what everything does.  You could play this game for a life time and 20 years down the road find out you can type /book 11 to go to your 11th page in the book.  There is no real documentation, no maps, no item description, no idea what stats do, etc..you leave all that for us to share amongst each other at 3rd party sites.<P>To close with, I think you're dreaming if you believe you can cut off the player base and separate your development and testing from your clients.  You will still make money, but I believe your player base will decline faster than would be normal.<P>Tinywulf of Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have played EQ since Beta 3.  I remember when there was NO one responding to the boards on a regular basis.. the complaints were hot and heavy then.  I believe that Verant NEEDS to communicate with their customers in places like this board because it gives them more "bang for the buck"... a higher visibility with the customer base.  The complaint from day one was that there is no customer service IN game.. you can't get hold of customer service on the telephone, e-mails, if responded to are given a canned response with constant complaints of no follow-up.  <P>Part of the board posting problems is that Verant has never learned how to use them effectively.  Many players have suggested a VERY positive idea of creating a Verant post only board.  The board would be for those posts that are made by Verant that actually respond to issues players have.  I remember the tremendous frustration so many had when Abashi used to post "I already answered this and I'm not going to answer it again".  Thing is, a lot of people (myself included) could rarely if ever FIND these posts.  A Verant post recap board would give a single place to find these obscure posts.  I often wonder why some issues are never responded to.. then I wonder if I just missed it somewhere.  Can't tell.. Yes, I know that the Verant posters can be sarcastic, I know that they can be defensive, but I can't always see a constructive answer and that's what *I* am looking for.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Good post so far. Nearly all the responses have been well thought out.<P>I viewed these boards before I actually started playing the game and I got a very negative feeling from these boards. Actually playing the game on the other hand I get a very positive feedback from people I have grouped with. This I feel is probably because I am no where near the end game. The majority of gripes seem to be from 50+ players.<P>Is it worth the hassle of keeping a board up and running where the majority of posts are complete rubbish or just whines? Well, occasionally the whine is well thought out and has a point, and also there are some real diamond ideas in there somewhere. The amount of time it takes to find these gems makes it slightly counterproductive.<P>By having these boards people feel they can change the game. This has two effects, firstly people who are fed up with the game keep playing longer because they feel they have a say and hope that someone listens and fixes it for them (in their eyes). It also means people get more upset about something than they might otherwise do. Rather than just cursing quietly and stopping to play for an evening now they come here to rant and watch as other ranters join in. Mob (as in group of people not the monsters :P) mentality takes over and they wind each other up into a frenzy, although it doesn't stop them playing.<P>Would shutting these forums down change that? not really there are always a number of user run message boards and it is there that the people would rant, albeit in slightly smaller numbers probably. You could always read the messages on those boards to get the majority of the feedback you get here. Only when they post here they feel that they are talking to Verant as much as to other gamers and this is an important part of customer feedback. However I personally don't think a message board in this sense is the best method. It attracts too much rubbish.<P>What you want from people is real ideas, proper gripes/problems. I think a better method of interaction with customer feedback would be a method of posting an 'idea'/'problem' then rather than being able to reply and padding it all out to make it unreadable. A user could rate a post, as in 1-10, 1 = disagree strongly, and 10 = agree strongly. Only one vote on a post per user. This has some major drawbacks. People often come up with slight adjustments to good ideas which improve them. Just being able to vote would remove this. However, you could have an ideas and a problems forum, where you decide which of the ideas/problems posted before can be opened up to debate.<P>In this forum the user would not be able to open a thread but merely respond to the threads as created by Verant.<P>Then possibly a final forum for 'iminent' changes which Verant are considering doing but not 100% sure. which again could work on a vote system. The vote style boards would require minimum maintenance I would have thought. <P>All of this could be done on top of these message boards, but what is the point? might as well just kick these boards into touch and let the user run pages host boards. Although keeping the server boards would be good. Not much griping on there and gives an extra facility to provide ideas to others on your server.<P>Obviously there are lots of other things to consider, cost of staff, time to read through posts, etc. etc. But IMHO the above method could work well. On other hand I may be completely missing the boat, but I thought best thing to do was state the idea and let it get shot down if its really stupid  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Several interesting points have been suggested already.<P>I, too, think these boards are a mixed blessing.<P>However, given VI's record on in-game testing, I seriously doubt that many of the bugs and faults with EverQuest that have been fixed would have been fixed without input from the boards:<P>1) Alchemy<BR>2) Poison<BR>3) "Hate" propogation bug<BR>4) Heal agro. (though even this is still being fixed)<P><BR>The biggest probem I see with the General Discussion forum is the large amount of spam and other irrelevent topics posted ("All You Base Are Belong To Us?!", "Part Two (Part Six)", and so forth), or posts of the same kind made in relevent threads.  This includes multiple topics posted on the same subject.<P>The second biggest problem is the lack of feedback feedback (yes, that's "feedback" twice).  That is, CSRs Absor, Aradune, Abashi, and whoever else respond very infrequently to the boards here.  It doesn't help that occasionally one of the so-called "blue names" will drop a "Yes, we're reading this" post.  In the past, this is untrustworthy at best.<P>The third biggest problem is what I think is a communications problem in VI.  This was what caused Abashi to have such a poor reputation before he was "promoted."  He'd post some information that was actually false, and could do little or nothing about it.  That's a communication problem from the developers to the PR guy.  Also, numerous times a CSR will post information on a subject implying one thing, and then a different CSR will post something implying an enitrely different thing.  Again, a communication problem is here.<P>Obviously these are just my opinions--but that's what was asked for.<P>Here's the obvious on how things can be improved:<P>1) Clean out the "out of context" posts and topics from General Discussion--and *keep them cleaned out*.<P>	1a) Make a limit to the number of new topics an account can make in a given time period.<P>	1b) Activate Flood Control at a time greater than 30 seconds.<P>2) Have Blue-Names post more frequently.<P>3) Get a communication system that actually works to pass correct information from one part of the team to another.<P>4) Have the Blue-Names that post here verify information they're given before posting it *with more than one source* where possible.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Could you please post some numbers of how many people actually log into these boards to read?<P>Why do I ask for this?  I am curious, DOES this board represent the minority I've been told it does?  And if so, how much of a minority...49% is a minority when all you can compare it to is 51%....<P>I'm not trying to attack you with numbers, I'd just really and honestly like to know what these boards represent.  If a significant number of EQ players do not view these boards, then maybe they are useless.  I rather thought that many people try to find info on these boards from time to time as well as post and try to make changes to the world.

</FONT><HR>One of the aspects that fascinates me about this GAME is the overall passion and dedication of the player base. This discussion board is a great example of that passion/dedication. No matter how vehemently people complain and whine, it shows that they CARE enough to do so. Caring about a product is like gold in the business world. Companies spend billions trying to get you to CARE about their products.  I believe that by responding to suggestions and making changes based on player feedback only endears people to the game - irregardless of their feelings regarding the changes.    <P>Don't think that whining and complaining are necessarily a bad thing - esp. for a computer game.  What would be bad for Verant is if these boards were dead because no one cared enough to post. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

They want to close these boards so only they know about all the problems in the game, thus keeping us in the dark and happy. <P>It's like in the old days were you were killed for talking bad about the king so you couldn't form a rebellion or organize a resistance.

</FONT><HR>While I agree that the boards contain mainly negative, whining and complaining people, these boards remain an invaluable source of information for verant and for other players.  Often, people will read about a bug that can occur and know how to avoid causing that bug.  This ends up saving time for in-game customer service who would otherwise have to resolve the problems after they occur.<BR>   Also, I continue to play this game, even with some bugs that continue to haunt me (i.e. getting massive linkdeaths that end up killing me at least once per night) because I know that Verant is responsive to their customer base.  If I thought that they were ignoring their customers and doing nothing to resolve the problems that are found, I would become frustrated and quit playing.<BR>   Playing in an evolving world where new content is added and fine tuned based on customer feedback makes this game (and other MMORPGs) what they are.  I have been playing for 2 years, just bough my third account, and am still as addicted as ever before.<P>Elly</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Saddly, I have to agree.  This board was an unprecidented step in designer/customer interaction and was in theory the best way to get players involved and improve the game, but it has failed. The immature selfish brats(not all players but far to many of them) that play this game have swarmed this board promoting whatever issue they feel is personaly beneficial; believing if thay whine enough and throw a big enough tantrum they will get whatever their spoiled greedy little heart desires.  The comparatively few worth while posts are drowned in a heap of crap generated by these brats. Real issues, and the overall best interests of the game seem to be ignored while the "vocal minorities" on this board rally behind whatever issue gets them some personal gain. The scarry part is that I fear Varant actually listens to some crap issues beliving that they are of concern to most of the players. <P>Verant would be better off playing their game on production servers at all levels, emulating all play styles, conducting playerpolls in game, and promoting the feedback command. This would get more people involved and look at a broader range of issues than what is presented by the minorities that dominate this board. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

It by no means changes my oppinion of the company or of the game.  <BR>I do wish that people posting these highly negative posts would realize that they are just wasting their time and stick to presenting their case in a logical and well thought out manner.

</FONT><HR>There have been a lot of good things come from this board. Many game play enhancements have been made as a result of this board. Some bad things have been stopped or brought to light as well. <P>If it wasn't for these boards and the massive protests about them scanning our PCs last year, then today each time you log in the would be going over every process running on your machine when you log in, and by now going through your files.<P>Abashi has done more to upset customers than any single person at VI, and all thanks to his, hmmmmm, let's call it bedside manner, or lack there off. I don't know if it is his writing style, or his actual attitude, but he comes accross as the biggest *** when he posts. He seems to be dismissive and rude. The replacement of Abashi by Absor, (Do all these guys just have to be at the front of the alpha loot line?) was one of the better moves they have made.<P>Making posters take responsibility via logging in under their play account names was a good idea, you can still post negative, and even insulting things about the personalities at VI on other forums, NNTP comes to mind, there are a couple of usenet newsgroups devoted to EQ. As a matter of fact, when Abashi makes an appearance here on the boards, I usually make a few highly insulting posts about him there. That's right, I make extremely insulting posts about Abashin on other forums, not here. I don't know why, but I have the most malevolent feelings toward him, his personlaity I guess.<P>So you see, you can take your negativy elsewhere, let's try to keep the boards constuctive. Now, I'm going to go insult Gordon on usenet, where they can't touch me, since they can't identify me there  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Alaranth<P>PS.
