</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I am hoping you find this way down on this section.  I play a 51 Bard on Quellious.  So I think I can speak to the positive aspects as well as the negative aspects.  <P>For some positives I loved my bard in early life could not get enough of him, versatile, fun, could fill several roles in the game.  I enjoyed the challenge of the the class.  <P>On the negative side since 40 its been more of a test of wills.  As you have read on many of the posts there are some serious issues in the higher levels for the bards of Norath.<P>I wanted to point out a few things that I see issues.<P>1.  If you get a rez at higher levels when you come back you have no mana.  As others have pointed out certain songs take mana.  Despirate Dirge takes a chunk of our mana to sing it once.  Well if we don't have the mana we can't use it.  Same goes for Charm, I have been called to charm after getting rezed and could not keep the charm going.  The Mana component needs to be removed from our songs or allow bards to be affected by our mana song.  But something has to give.<P>2. I think you are all hung up on this Mana free stuff to much.  A perfect example is the Burntwood Staff from Chardok.  300+ unlimited right click MANALESS nukes for the mages.  Yet when the Bards complain about 1 song that uses the bulk of our mana, and no way to regain our mana quickly we are basically told its that way because it takes no mana.  I think if you look at Despirate Dirge and this staff you will see a large disparity.  Bards are not asking for Ice Commet, we are asking for a timer on the song that does not involve the use of Mana but that is reasonably spaced to use.  You have given other classes the ability to do damage with out mana please correct this disparity.<P>3.  Fix the Drum animation.  The drum animation has been around since Beta, yet since Beta it was important to make models for the Emotes, like bow and salute.  At least throw us a bone ok, this bit of its not high on the list is getting old.  Models supposedly went in for new helms but we can't get a stupid drum built?  Give us some respect ok this is like making a Necro only robe pink in color and saying after you don't have the resources to correct it.  This is an important issue and it needs fixing.<P>4.  Please adress the issues of post 50 play and our damage output.  If you wont allow us to do more damage in songs then give us double attack.  But in the post 50 game we are severely lacking in our ability to do what you folks at Verant have set up for a mothod of getting experience, which is to kill and kill and kill....  We need to be able to contribute in this by doing our fair share of damage output.  <P>5.  This is more of a question on Quests which I enjoy doing.  I spent 3 days of playing killing Mobs for some items for a bracer quest.  Yet when I turned in the items I got less experience for the quest than had I gone and kited one blue mob.  I think that Quests should be more Dynamic in nature taking longer to achieve but should also give alot more experience.  The name of the game is "EverQuest".  Quests should give a much larger amount of experience than the token issued out currently.<P>In closing I to have lost alot of faith that Verant will make the most potentially fun and interesting class a viable class.  I started a Magician and have worked him to a respectable level.  I hope that a MAJOR revamp is in order even if it includes some serious game play changes.  The current state of the class is less than acceptable and will continue to remain such until a revamp occurs.<P>Martin Skalding on Q</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>SUMMARY<P>The main points on the board, which coincidentially I agree with are as follows. <P>1. Raise bard damage potential by 15-25% by A. double attack, B. increased song damage C. By adding backstab (personally an idea odious to me) D. raising skill cap on weapons<P>2. Raise a bard's ability to tank by A. lowering the levels we gain parry and riposte to 40 and 50 respectivly. Raise the caps to the level of a paladin/SK for riposte and parry. Raise defense skill to 230.<P>3. Allow Bard speed buff songs to stack with spells, and item effects. Most likely a nightmare to code, but would make the class viable on raids, and keep a bards utility up to the level of other classes post 40.<P>4. Allow resists to follow the same path as velious mob hps. Unlimited. Again this would give bards a place on raids besides being a mana battery.<P>5. Change the Denon's Desperate dirge to A. a skill with a reset time like HT and LOH. B. Alter the damage/mana ratio. c. Change this spell to a DD. D.  consider having it have the effect of a lure line spell if you intend on mana cost remaining insanely high. <P>6. Change bombastic Bellow (55) song to have a delay substantially less than its current one. A. Perhaps it would refresh every 2 pulses. B. remove the stun effect so it can effect unstunable mobs or let it deal damage without stunning said mobs.<P>7. Change level 37 charm to affect creatures equal to the level of the bard, and flag certain ubermobs as unaffected by this song (boss mobs).<P>8. Change level 53 mezz song to affect creatures equal to the bards level + 3 with no cap. (Flag certain boss mobs as unmezzable by this song). B Make this song last for 5 pulses instead of 3.<P>9. Epic weapon drops. Make guts more common off trak. Make white dragon scale attainable like red scale by allowing another mob to spawn with the white scale.<P>10. Balance our singing steel armor along the lines of other defensive hybrids, and add useful effects to these armors like other classes get. (unbalancing suggetions were) SOW effect, levitate effect, Invis effect, Summon 20 food, Summon 20 water.<P>11. Raise bard's roguish skills of sneak hide and picklocks post 50.<P>12. Fix various bard bugs (not really a balance issue and I think you know most of the bugs)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Quote from a magician:<P><BR>Draelon says, "I don't see how summoning 5 or 10 or 20 at a time would imbalance anything"<BR>Just 1 quick response...sorry, Draelon - that would tread upon the magician's realm, even if it is only summoning mundane items between combat. Magicians are required to go through pain-staking research to get Everfont (summoning stack of water), and Corucopia must be either researched or purchased *only* in Qeynos. Why should bards get that for free (summoning FULL stack) on an item? Don't mean to sound pissy but it's a pain in the butt collecting items for these spells when you want the same thing. Magicians are the masters of summoning.<P>Having to kill Venril Sathir, wait on hise huge loot table to get bard legs and then get choose by your guild to finally wear them isnt an easy task.<P>And btw qeynos isnt too hard to come by a level 1 can easily walks from freeport to qeynos without getting killed and if you are a dark elf wiggle 4 pp at a little newbie for your cornupia spell :P<P>Now on a brighter note, Absor please check Thott posts, they show the facts That we should get Bard haste to stack and slow down songs.<P>21% of our songs are useless when a enchanter and shaman is around.<P>Only the little stats stays for few haste songs, which are often either capped with decent equipment and shaman high buffs who cannot only stay 15 seconds but for 1 hour.<P><BR>Aledark<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Not to mention our crappy summon food drink and eye of zomm we need some improving stuff heck firework effect would be cooler the eye of zomm.<P>Also i think we should get some invis undead song like our invis but just to undead its real annoying to wait an hour in guk for someone to invis u when ur 2 hybrid parents have invis undead ( enchanter/rogue ).<P>and please fix some of our crappy songs like our lucid lullaby give me a break that never works and them songs of dwan and midnight whos acullly gonna keep them memed all the time or take the time to remem them which is another issue bwt just for the apropriate time.<P>We also need a higher med skill for mana regen and our song meming it takes 5 minutes to emm songs somtimes please cap it at like 50 or something.<P>Our pick lock is useless need i say more?<P>our drums look like flute but yall already know that.<P>and maybe some type of song special to our selves that neither enc or rogue have like maybe some group gate song but like make it take like 20 sec song cast and have a recast time of 20 min or so. since we are about groups that would save our group.<P>Also maybe actully have some kinda music special to each song we are supposed to ettertain people u know.<P>Give us more illusions since we are kin to enchanters.<P>I know prolly none of this stuff will get done but maybe it will help u when deciding what to do and dont do thanks for listening <P>Jaxor Mightynote<P> <BR> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I would like to be useful to groups again.  When I started my bard, I was so versitile it was crazy- now, I am lucky to find a group.  My haste doesn't stack, my strength buffs don't stack, my snare interferes with other snares, in short, all my abilities are surpassed by other classes- so why would a group ask a bard to come along other than the infamous "Play mana song plz"  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif">  Few groups know the true advantage of having a bard, but at higher levels, we are sorely stripped of usefulness.  When what we have to offer is not only exceeded by other classes, but doesn't stack with what other classes cast, we are reduced to mana batteries and poor meleers.  Bards in the lower and mid levels are so much more than that.  Why should I decrease in usefulness and power as I level higher?? <BR>Free (manaless) spells are worth nothing if the group I am with cannot use them.  I would argue also that they are not free- yes, only two cost mana, but while I am singing that song (or twisting 3) I am now limited to singing those 3 songs to keep up the effect.  A caster may expend mana to achieve effect, but, once cast, they may move on to the next spell leaving the other still in effect.<P>Bah- its late at night, so I am likely rambling, but let me reiterate by saying that I wanted to be useful to a group- that is why I chose this class.  Now, at level 52, I have significantly fewer choices as I did when I was 25.

</FONT><HR>Real quickly...<P>Roleplaying. Bards are the most fun character to play. Everyone here has outlined heaps of fantastic ideas for gameplay issues and they're great. I just want to put 2c in for the roleplaying nature of the class.<P>- Bard items: Lets have morris dancers costumes, floppy hats etc. Bards are the comedians, singers and entertainers. Let us look like it.<P>- Familiars: Maybe like a Velious bunny or a Kunark chicken. Congratulates the bard on succesful spells? Follows me round and gets in no ones way but mine. Maybe even adds to the effectiveness of certain songs?<P>Damn, out of time.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>My comments will strictly address one facet of Bardic life, melee effectiveness. In the spirit of taking a look at what is inherently "wrong" with the Bard class I think most everything stems back to a decision made in Beta 2, if I remember correctly, that Bards would not get Double Attack, but rather Dual Wield exclusively.<P>Let's examine this.  Dual Wield (DW) grants a person the ability to attack with two weapons.  Double Attack (DA) is a chance to attack twice with any given swing of a weapon. EQ's combat was designed around the idea that the right hand weapon (primary) would do the majority of the damage for ALL classes in the game, with the stipulated exception of two-handed weapons.  Most classes would only wield one weapon and the pure melee (Warrior, Rogue, Monk) could attack with 2 weapons.  The Ranger hybrid would be allowed to also utilize 2 weapons at a time and have DA, but would sacrifice armor to gain this ability.<P>In early Beta Verant was concerned with class balance and felt that Bards were already the superior hybrid as far as casting ability.  Therefore they tried to limit the offensive melee efficiency of Bards by not giving them DA as every other melee and hybrid class gets, and by excluding them from using 2 handed weapons.  This was a poor decision for the following reasons.<P>1)	It too severely impacted a Bards offense. Which has been exposed in post 50 Norrath.<BR>2)	It had a secondary effect of lowering the effective AC of a Bard to little more than that of a chain wearing class as Bards would seldom utilize a shield, as then they would lose a significant portion of their offensive effectiveness.<P>So what should Verant have done?  Well Verant could have given Bards Double Attack but capped it at a level that accomplished the same offensive result they were looking for.  This would allow Bards to utilize a shield like all of the other “defensive” hybrids. They could have excluded Bards from having the ability to Bash with the shield, and also maintained the prohibition against two-handed weapons.<P>How could Verant now correct this issue and what ramifications would it have?  This would assume that Verant does consider Bards as having too low of a defensive rating compared to other hybrids and pure melee.  This is what I would do:<P>1)	Determine a Double Attack cap for pre and post 50 Bards that places them in the correct position on the melee offensiveness table that holds to the “Vision.”<BR>2)	Phase in Double Attack and eliminate Dual Wield for Bards by taking the Bards current skill in DW and transferring it to their new DW skill (not to exceed the hard cap), or if that is not feasible then give Bards the maximum DA skill for their respective level.<BR>3)	All weapons currently equipped in the off-hand when this change is phased in either drop to inventory or are automatically placed on the mouse cursor for the player if there is no room in inventory for the item.<P>This would allow Bards to increase their AC by utilizing a shield and Verant would not need to fudge around with Defense caps and other skills. This would also allow Bard to maintain their current level of offensive output.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Pick Locks better!<P>You can't always have a rogue handy to do this on raids or in groups or whatever. As of now the only thing that bards can really pick is Befallen and meaningless stuff. <P>It would be nice to see bards used to raid dungeons like Chardok, or even the sebilis crypt. Its not like this would greatly affect class balance either. There aren't too many bards on the server as it is and it would make us more useful. Rogue would still have a greater advantage with dealing damage (backstab), better defensive skills, hide/sneak, pick pocketing etc. <P>Having the ability to pick locks would enable us to have a greater role on raids, groups etc. And be a more "needed" class. Cause right now we aren't very "needed" we are more of an enhancement to groups when they have room for us.<P>Right now a rogue gets the ability to pick high level locks at 51. Why not allow for a 53 or 55 bard to get the same skill? This still would give rogues the advantage and give bards a role and something to look forward to in the high level game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One ping and one ping only....BIND! Bards should be able to bind themselves.... OK I hear the screaming of "your a hybrid!" to which I say , no we are not...we are a unique class one much closer to being a caster than being a warrior, one with low weapon and defensive skills but super taunts, we die alot and we are the only PURE caster that does not get bind. I do not see how bards could have been cast into such a catagory. Make a bind song and make it around level 25, if clerics(who wear plate and can cast super damage spells in comparrison), can bindhow would allowing bards impact the class balance of EQ. I argue it would not and only benefit those few talented individules who play thier bards.Bards are second only to druids for travelability and should have the ability to "link" with their new surrroundings in order to better tune into their audiences....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>  I play a L 40 bard on Karana, and overall I'm pretty happy with the class, although I can't comment on the high level game.  <P>  I think the role of a bard is to enhance a group without detracting from it.  Bards may not have the most powerful abilities, but we are never OOM, and are always adding to the group, not sitting around medding.  This is a strength: We have staying power, and a weakness: our abilities tend to be weaker over the short term than 'pure' classes.  I'd like to see any changes to the class reflect this.  At higher levels, bard songs seem to weaken compared to casters while melee skills weaken compared to melee and hybrid classes.  I think bards could use some minor tweaks in both areas to make us a bit more useful.<P>I have a few suggestions that I think would make bards more useful:<P>1.  Better defensive skills.  I see bards as depending on finesse rather than brute force in combat.  It makes sense to me that we would be able to fend off our opponents blows and strike back when they are off guard.  We should gain parry around L 40 with a cap of 150+ and riposte at 50 with a similar cap.  This would not make us into tanks or infringe on anyone's role in combat, but would give us a bit more staying power.<P>2. Better Crowd control.<P> a) Better charm is probably out of the question since it is so powerful at high levels.  Longer duration would infringe on the enchanter's role, but I think a fixed duration (3 ticks) for the L39 charm would not be overpowering.  Charm does not stack, so you would still lose control for at least a short time.<P> b) Better mez.  As it is, a bard can only keep 1 or 2 mobs (because of resists) out of combat while effectively removing himself from combat.  I think that a bard who dedicates himself to CC should be almost as useful as an enchanter since the enchanter has the option of charming, buffing, stunning, etc while selectively mezzing mobs.  Pixie strike can't have it's resist rate decreased because it also has the effect of a manaless stun which interrupts casting.  This is the reason the AE mez has to become weaker at higher levels, it cripples caster mobs.  I would like to see an increase to the duration of our 2 mez songs to allow us to throw in the occasional haste, or to affect more mobs if we spend all of our time mezzing.  A 1 tick increase at levels 40, 50, and 60 would not turn us into CC gods like enchanters, but would make us more useful in these situations.   Another idea would be to add 1 or 2 ticks if you are playing a wind instrument.  This would make bards more effective at CC when dedicating themselves to this role, but would also detract from our other roles in the combat.  Longer duration would have no impact on on interrupting casting.  This is the only song line where I would favour greater duration.<P> 3) Increased skill caps.  Safe fall should cap somewhere around 75.  Sneak, hide and forage at 100.  SF of 75 is still lower than rogue & monk caps (I think rogue SF should be capped higher as well, but that's another thread).  Sneak and hide are of dubious use for non-rogues since they can't be used together.  Bard hide is below some racial skill levels.  A forage of 55 is just above some racial limits, and is so unreliable most bards never use it.  I spent 6 hours foraging for an ancient coin in EJ (a bard quest!) and ended up having to get a druid to forage one for me.  I could not even reliably maintain my food level during that period.  I understand that we are jacks of all trades, masters of none, but having multiple useless skills does not benefit us in any way. <P>4) More diverse instruments.  Possibly player crafted.  I can see drums that double as a shield, a lute that can be used as a 1hb (ka-bong! :-) ).  There are instruments like these in the game, but they are invariably god drops.  Mid level weapons with an instrument effect could have a lesser effect than an standard instrument.  eg: if a regular instrument doubles a song effect, a specialized weapon could add 30 or 50%.  This would make melee possible while adding a slight bonus to our songs.<P>5) Better stacking.  Bard songs will stack with many effects if they are applied after the effect, but not before.  EG:  Hymn will stack over regen, but not vice versa.  This means that bards limit which spells can be cast at any time, especially in combat.  If 2 effects are not too powerful in combination, I don't see why the order of application should matter.<P>Things I would NOT like to see:<P>1)  Massive increases in melee damage.  Bards have good damage output as it is.  I don't see any need for melee in line with a ranger or warrior.  <P>2) Any additional automation.  Bards require a certain amount of skill.  A cleric who cannot react fast enough to heal someone in combat before they die should not be playing a cleric.  Someone who has trouble with swapping instruments, and twisting songs should not play a bard.  Hotkeys already make this easier on the hands.  This aspect is one of the defining qualities of a good bard, please don't remove it.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>  Well I've seen alot of great things about what needs to be done, and ideas that spark some great and creative solutions.  Problem is I can think of alot of ways VI can say no to most of them.  Absor, if you want sollutions to blancing our class, then define more closly what you think our class should be.  Are we a hybrid? or built from the ground up?  You seem to cross this boundry at will and use which ever is convenint to make a point.  I understand that you and the team you work with have a vision of what bards are and what they should be, but we who play the class arn't playing in your theory but the working world.  I suggest you drop ALL PRETEXT of what you think the bard should be and just work with what we are.<P>  Just a thought Absor, but have you ever gone to the other classes and asked what they think of us.  I know many posting here play other classes.  In fact I would say all of us do.  When you say we need to tell others what we can do, your saying that when we play other clases we don't know what bards can do.  But we do have exp on being on the other side of the mirror.  And when we play we also agree that playing mana song is the best thing we can do for the group in a general sisuation.  And we agree that our buffs in general suck.  So it seems to me, do you want to make our class more balanced, or keep with the role playing excuses you've been throwing at us.<P>  If we are the group specilist then we should be the most demainded of any class when a group is formed.  Yet that is not the case.<P>Well glad you have turned your face to look at us.  I appriciate your job and what you have to do, but from where I sit, it seems you look at the mirror and we play in it.  And though you see alot that we will never see or understand, we know what our class is and what it's not.  And we're not wanted much in a group right now despite what you think.<P>Luck with you on your quest Absor.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor<P>If it is your understanding that a bard should be able to maintain his instrumental skills simply through normal play, here is some information for you. Last night, in order to raise my wind skill up (hadn't done this in 4-5 levels), I left my bard playing invis song overnight. I forgot about him, and went to work. When I arrived home, 20 hours after walking away from the computer, I had gained only 19 points of skill.<P>My character has an intelligence of only 75, and is 41st level. <P>For myself and most bards, we play the drums and the strings quite often during normal play. However, brass isn't played very often, and wind is only played for the very few songs that require it like invisibility. The reason is that they have so few songs that provide additional bonuses (damage, fewer resists, more health, etc) for playing the wind instrument, and therefore won't go up during normal play. <P>For me, over the last 20 levels, I have only gained about 10 skill points in either brass or wind from 'normal play' - the rest have all come from sitting my bard in the corner overnight to work on his skill. <P>I'll bet we'd bother rather that I not have to do so - me to avoid the possibility of something happening to my character, and you to avoid the bandwith usage. <P>Just a thought for you to use or ignore. And please feel free to verify the numbers and times I provided.<P>Whit Scarletsong<BR>42 songs on Solusek Ro<BR>Scarlet Horizon</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Most of the things that have been said it the past I agree with, however, one aspect of being a performer has been completely overlooked.  Bards should get Feign Death.  As actors, bards have more experience at faking death, including the special effects involved in the show.  Yet, three other classes can fake a death, but, a bard who has been falling down on stage since he was a youngster can not.  This is obviously an oversight that can easily be corrected.<P>P.S.  Either fix the drum or tell the truth.  It is not low on the priority list, it is not on the list because bards make up the smallest user population, therefore, do not count.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>(8)Kelin's Lugubrious Lament:  love to see lower resists, or a reliable (maybe extended) duration, casting time/duration can lull about 3 mobs and pull a fourth (with a dagger so no more casting time), given no resists. (wishlist)<P>(15)Kelin's Lucid Lullaby: Who cares, if it worked, it'd be too powerful.<P>(23)Selo's consonant chain: Snare duration is important to be reliable, you can chain cast this (so it refreshes every 3 seconds) and still have the mob get those inches he needs, duration should have a minimum of four seconds, 9 would be great to keep the juggle, but usefulness over ease.<P>(39) Solon's Bewitching Bravura:  Level cap introduced to this song to avoid a really, really, REALLY powerful bug.  Quick fixes are necessary, but I'd like to see them remedied with more long term ones.<P>(43)Denon's Desperate Dirge: Truly a useless song, all agree on that, I see two really good things  that could be done to this song to make it useful.<P>a) Make it a AE Stun and -MR, when the stuff hits the fan, say 5 mobs come in the room, twilight takes a good long while to get in the groove, adding is easy, but picking a train apart not so easy.  I seen the group get torn apart faster than the casting time of song of twilight could fix the situation, a one time AE stun could give you that time you need.  (also be great if the code allowed it to give a random direction knockback, so stacks of mobs seperated themselves for ease of targeting)<P>b) a healing over time song, with the mana and time constraints of the desperate dirge, this would be much more befitting of the song.  (you do the ratios, I understand that this option could have balance issues, but the line for usefulness/imbalance has to be in there somewhere)<P>(44)Cassindra's Elegy: The only time I've ever, everevereverever, sung this song, was when i was having an enchanter craft jewelry for me out of expensive stones. :P  This song is just useless in combat.  In my opinion, this is the first of few songs that need their duration increased so that it is more of a buff than a song, a benefit of having a bard in the group.  In this case, the extra mana given is taken away if the bard misses just 1 second and the buff drops.  Personally, I don't care about this song, it's a caster song, and bards are for melees.<P>(51)Selo's Song of Travel: I figured I'd put this here just because alot of arguement about it before, in my opinion, it would be useful with, and without invisibility.  Best solution imo, make a song, (51)Selo's Song of Safe Travel.  2 songs, no flat bards in dreadlands  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P>(51) Largo's assonant binding: see selo's consonant chain.<P>(53) Song of Twilight: JoeBard casts song of twilight on a mob, JoeEnchanter casts mesmerize on a mob.  JoeBard's song of twilight wears off. This breaks mez entirely.  JoeBard's song of twilight could save MANY more enchanters if this stacking issue was fixed.<P>(55) Cantana of Replenishment: I read a post suggesting that this be changed to pulse, DO NOT CHANGE THIS SONG.  I rotted away long enough 32-54, casters constantly nagging me to throw ALL my other abilities out the window to provide them with 24-7 mana service.<P>(55) Occlusion of Sound: Ok, this song wasn't exactly what i expected it to be, I was hoping it would be something the bard could use as a tool for mezzing, giving up the 3 second casting time for a tishan rather than a mez reduces the amount of mobs you can actually mez, defeating what I hoped to be its purpose, I suppose its useful in a caster support role, I just had higher hopes for this song.  (wishlist, would love to see this song have an increased duration time, so that its useful in our own casting)<P>(56) Song of Midnight, Song of Highsun: I really like what you guys did here with the day/night songs, really great feature of the code.  Problem is, they're useless.  I really don't care that they're useless, a useless song to me is just a pretty icon in my spell book, not something that I was robbed of.  My only gripe: good coding gone to waste.  If you did make a spell/song like this, it would need to be used in less important circumstances, for example, the AE fear one would only be used to scare everything away so you could run yourself (obviously, this song wouldn't be used in fear kiting because of the +movement speed).  Can you imagine if evac were only castable at night or day? I find myself memming the lower level one when I think I might need it.<P>(57)Mcvaxius' Rousing Rondo:  I'd like to see more haste on this, something better than (54)Vilia's Chorus of Celerity.  Just wishlist stuff. :P<P>(59)Solon's Charismatic Concord:  Lets face it, if a bard is grouped with a chanter, hes his er...I can't think of a good word to put there so lets leave it unsaid.  This is another one of the songs I'd like to see duration increased on...charisma is important for mind spells ie. crowd control, lull, things that bards do. You're just not gonna waste casting time on charisma if you're in the middle of mezzing 4 mobs, if you do, that means one will break...in my opinion, this should be a 1-2 minutes or so duration, given the mem time on the song (30-45 seconds), you just wouldn't get this song out to buff yourself, its limiter would be to have it in your spell line up, but it would actually benefit you being there.<P>***Haste and Slow songs in general:  Given the nature of most bard songs, I think it'd be pretty easy to say that most all high level bards consider themselves a melee support class before a caster support class.  God forbid the day that singing mana song for casters becomes more important than the many other things we can do for melees...the meleeing mana song bard is just, boring.  Alot of talk out there about haste and slow, I'd like to see an improved slow, but I wouldn't die if I didn't.  Haste, on the other hand, has ALWAYS been my rant, conjure yourself up a L60 enchanter, and conjure yourself up a L60 bard.  Go LFG in somewhere like sebillis.  The group you join is either A) friends, B) a group that already has a chanter, or C) a group that can't find a chanter.  I can't stand grouping with enchanters, they inhibit a bard's playing to the point of making them useless.  Personally, I'd like to see bard's the king of haste.  I know all that jack of all trades, master of none stuff.  Lets face it, things don't always work out as planned...(why are we here in the first place).  <P>Look at it from a group's point of view:<P>The enchanter brings better slow to the group. <BR>I can agree with this entirely, it suits the enchanters role as a defensive caster class.<P>The enchanter brings better crowd control to the group.  Always has, Always will, the way it should be.  This is the end all, be all of high level enchanters.  Cleric's dominance of healing, Warriors dominance of tanking, its what they do.<P>The group's clarity 2 doesn't wear off if the enchanter is mezzing mobs.  So they're better mana pimps, big deal, i can ignore the one or two casters I group with that (while mezzing shrooms) scream for mana song.<P>*****Enchanter's dominance on haste, I've always felt that the bard should have the throne in this, they're *MUCH* more geared towards being a melee offensive/defensive support class than an enchanter.  So, its manaless, it lasts 9 seconds and is !!!PARTY ONLY!!!.  I hate to scream "nerf it!" but the enchanter epic even crossed the bard's manaless line providing a better, longer lasting, non-group only, manaless haste buff.  I can't even haste my own group on plane raids anymore!  I would be !!!COMPLETELY!!! satisfied with my class if I could say that I did just this ONE thing better than an enchanter.*****<P>-------Singing Steel-------<P>Love to see some of it changed, but the only thing I feel needs changing is the legs and bp, espescially the bp.  I really wish I copied the quote from the last time this was brought up, where someone said that it was "supposed to be useful".  Oh well, small issue, imo, who cares.<P>end</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Otherwise we'd still be playing Ultima Online! I want to see my Bard playing drums, that definitely adds to me enjoying the game. Another thing : switching between weapons and instruments ALSO is bugged and looks stupid since the instrument animation will continue with a weapon, or vice -versa!<P>2) I am only level 29 and already have been asked several times for the mana song. The worst is those that assume I have it dont ask for it, they just TELL me to play it!<P>When you are a Cleric you have the responsibility to heal the right buddy at the right time.<P>When you are an Enchanter mezz the right baddies at the right time.<P>When you are a WAR beat the right nasties and taunt them and assist properly.<P>When you are a Bard, OTHER players TELL you to play the mana song. They take off the responsibility from you, so that you give THEM mana so that THEY can have fun at the game and do the right thing they need to do at the right time, no to mention THEY the PLAYERS (not the characters) will enjoy less downtime and have more fun at the expense of YOURS! And this is talking about PLAYER enjoyment of the game usign the Bard class, and the players pay the bill, not the characters!<P>Imho, the Bard should keep weak at songs and be a decent melee (which is  what I like, hacking and slashing and doing a bit of casting).<P>Sadly there is apparently no class like that in EQ at high levels you eventually become ineffective melee or full melee.<P>THe other option is make us GOOD at songs, and give us some songs that do not transfer the game controls to other players at the expense of our fun, and let us be weak melee.<P>Either option is fine by me, as for now, I think I will begin to consider drop my Bard as I really _HATE_ to hear ppl asking me to play the mana song.<P>Again, at level 29 all I can do in group is Anthems (slight haste appreciated at mid levels), Melodic Binding (small debuff), and War song to help me dish 1 or 2 more dmg with the STR and it is sad because it's not even group song. What else ? healing is done by the cleric, snare/root by the druid, whenever I mezz I get reduced to mashed potatoes.

</FONT><HR>Just a quick note...<P>I haven't muddled through EVERY single post, mostly because they all seem to repeat much of the same things.  My lvl 21 bard is my main and it has taken me over a year to get this far (laugh not, some of us only get to play once a week or so). A couple items did strike me though.<P>First, my favorite idea brought forth (in what, maybe the FIRST part of the discussion) was to have instrument specialization. Beautiful, perfect and VERY realistic. Go for this Verant.  <P>Second is the dude who offered "resonance" as a higher level skill.  ALSO beautiful idea and makes sense. Why wouldn't experianced bards be more adept at holding tones, 4 clicks, heck why not even more. Would it be THAT unbalanced to get 4 clicks at 50? And more at each level thereafter?<P>I also like the tavern teleport song, which is yet again right on for a role playing bard. And while we're at it, how 'bout making that alcohol tolerance beneficial to someone finally? Perhaps (and this is just a suggestion...) the better tolerance, the higher defensive skills, after all I personally feel MUCH less pain when I'm drunk!<BR>Hmmmm.

</FONT><HR>I think there should be a new trade skill like fletching where bards can make there own insterments. You could get an enchanter to enchant them or somthing to make them magical and aslo maybe make a weapon/insterment. Of course the weapon/insterment wouldent be that good. Also i think there should be a tinkered item like a music machine that acts as all the insterments at once but it should weigh alot. <P>Bards also need new songs that help the group more bards should be great in groups but i find my self not wanted comparred to other classes.<P>Bards singing steel armour effects just suck. They are pointless why do we need to summon food and water and stuff while other classes get effects that acually help them.<P>There needs to be more insterments for mid lvl bards maybe quests like the tamborine would be nice.<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>#1. Bards are a different type of magic user from all others in the game, therefore bard songs should ONLY have stacking issues with other bard songs. For all other types of magic songs should stack either additively or the one with the greater effect should be used, but they should NEVER cause a spell or song to cancel or be uncastable. (Almost all songs should be added to the spell effects, the only combination I can think of that should take the greater effect is selo's and spirit of the wolf).<BR>#2. Songs should be extremly hard to resist. They have to be resung so often that making the chain songs resisted 10% of the time that a snare spell would be resisted is probably TO MUCH RESISTENCE for the song.<BR>#3. Twisting songs is a pain. Bards need a skill at about level 20 or lower that allows multiple songs to be played at once. I would like it to start a song then the other song gems come back until you are playing all the songs you can play at once for that skill level then they all stay greyed. This skill would also address the problem of a level 1 bard can play 3 songs and a level 60 bard can play 3 songs. For example if the skill kicked in at level 20 you could play 4 songs total 2 at once and 2 more twisted.<BR>4#. A level 1 bard can play at most 3 songs, A level 60 bard can play at most 3 songs. Something about that just doesn't make sense, there should be some increase at higher levels. (By the way I am using 3 songs as an optimax, I personaly can only reliablely twist 2 songs. The third one either drops before I get back to it or the new pulse goes away with the old song. (That bug affects all casters too, it's just more noticable to a bard cause we are always trying to get the new song started the same time the old one goes away.))<BR>#5. Less agro or more defense (or both). One thing I always have to explain to people who don't play with bards much is that in a multimob pull assist the puller for the first one the bard for all after that. For the reasons that all the extra mobs will normally be beating on the bard and they will have the bard autotargeted on the next pulse of whatever song I'm playing.<BR>#6. Party songs need the range increased. Especially travel type songs and the invisible song. It doesn't take much lag for someone to get out of range and fall to their death during a levitate, or during an invisible excursion into an area where everything will kill you if it sees you. Increasing duration of these songs would also be a good idea, the invisible song should have a minimum duration of 6 seconds (2 pulses).<BR>#7. Kick should be availible to bards from level one. I have played in bands in real life and the first thing you learn is to tap your foot to keep time, it is a very small step from this to the basic kick skill in Norrath. I have seen bash metioned in several of the posts in this thread but kick seems much more appropriate for a bard to me.<P>These items are the main ones that I have observed to be needed to improve the balance of the class in my 31 concert tours. Now we move on to the wish list.<P>#1. Instrument weapons and weapon instruments. I fully approve of the weapons that also act as instruments, I hope to be getting one sometime soon, and I would like to see more of them available. I would also like to see all instruments act as weapons. For example a hand drum could be 1 hand blunt damage 5 delay 40, a brass horn a pierceing weapon with about the same stats. Not good enough for using all the time but enough so that I don't feel totally useless in a battle playing an instrument.<BR>#2. More races should be able to play bards. In a cutural sense, I see bards as the step between shaman and intelligence based pure casters. So any race that doesn't alow either of these should allow bards. Plus Iksar since they are currently moveing from one to the other (allow shamans but only one type of intelligence caster, the necro). I'd love to see gnome bards too but I can't come up with a way to justify it in game terms. Dark elves should probably be added too since they were created to corrupt anything an elf can do.<BR>#3. Illusions for all the races of norrath. Bards are supposed to be entertainers and reasonably recieved by most people. That just doesn't seem possible without illusion masks or whatever for most if not all playable races in Norrath. However, cool as it may be, the werewolf illusion on the lute of the howler doesn't fit in this mold  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">.<BR>#4. Bard only armor that is entertaining. I don't want to go around looking like the court jester, but bard only armor should be more visually appealing than flat blue and green. Adding in different colored scroll work on the existing armor would help alot, and should not be too hard to do. <P>Surprize the wish list is shorter than the list of stuff that I think needs to be done, either that or I just can't figure out how to say it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>Harmonious Dyskordious<BR>31 tours and still singing<BR>The Rathe<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I'm probably too late on this but I'd like to give you a sense of what my experiences in barding have been like and perhaps help in re-shaping my class slightly.<P>First a bit of background which i think is relevant.  I chose barding for the variety.  I think most bards do this actually.  You can see the other classes and they are typicall fairly narrowly defined in what their roles are.  But not so much bards - for much of a bard's life the world is a place of constant change and adaptation.<P>We are in the thick of combar, we are secondary healers (early on), we are capable of doing some crowd control and we can even toss a few useful buffs into the mix.  There is seldom a time in a young bard's life when there isn't something really useful he or she can be doing.<P>But then this begins to change.  Now this change goes across all classes and is I think inherently the reason we keep having these things come up.  The change is that as one increases in level one decreases in both power and scope relative to the things one is fighting.<P>It's an odd paradox to go up in power and yet down in effectiveness relative to the enemies one faces at higher level.  This and the class-interdependency push leads to really narrowly defined roles for each class at the higher levels. Clerics sit stand heal sit stand heal - wizards sit stand nuke sit stand nuke etc.<P>Everyone chafes at this and it causes a lot of dissatifaction with life at higher levels (this is my opinion obviously).<P>Well it hits bards really really hard.  After passing level 32 and getting the mana song the bard is able to group pretty much at will.  Of course a bad group = dead bard about 95% of the time so one needs to be careful about which groups to join.  The downside is that the bard's role shrinks down to mana battery and some buffing. <P>After a few levels of this I quit the game for 8 months.  Who wants to go from being generally useful and having an interesting life to being narrowly useful and bored.<P>I now play a rogue - in comparison a simple class with a simple mission.<P>But I'd rather play my bard if things weren't so different at higher levels.<P>So how would I fix bards? Well I'd focus on the thing which drew players to bards to begin with - versatility. In usefulness is power for a bard.<P>Things I'd add or change:<BR>1) DoT songs really could use a damage message - Bard DoT songs are nice and darn useful but we are inherently a bunch of players used to seeing damage messages. So when you go to a DoT song there is no feedback that you are doing any good.  Sure the mobs will aggro on you indicating damage to them but not having that message really makes it less fun to twist songs and harder to determine the best of many strategies one might take.  <P>2) Ignoring balance bards should be more charming than they are.  Just based on the 'historical records' of bards in high fantasy.  Including balance issues Bard charm or bard mes needs work at levels from 35 on up.  I don't mind spending mana on a charm but if the bard is to perform any meaningful crowd control against the sort of mobs one meets at higher levels the charm or mes has to last longer.  What a bard can do is recast of course - which is fine - but when things hit so hard and bard hit points are so low (mine are only slightly more than a shaman's of comparable level) this leads to a lot of dead bards.<P>I know enchanters are the masters of crowd control but there need to be viable alternatives in case there aren't enchanters around.<P>if a bard charm lasted on a single target until either the mana was exhausted or the bard took any action other than charming and ordering the pet (including moving, being attacked, attacking, casting another song etc.) then you'd have a viable alternative to use in critical situations.<P>You could choose to drop all other things you could do to charm a mob and hold the charm on it for a minute if needed.  <P>It sounds like a lot but you lose the bard's buffs, damage shields, damage output etc. which the focused charm is on.  <P>Similarly one could do the same thing with upper level mez - essentially if the bard is concentrating on nothing but the song the target stays mezzed till it is attacked or the bard moves or does some other action.  Not sure why you'd want to mez if you couuld charm but these are really just discussion points for illustration.<P>3) Bards in plate armor just seems dumb to me really but that's the way the game is played so i'll accept the plate wearing bard.  But the dodge and parry caps are set to low for a class which has to rely on surving many many attacks in order to do anything meaningful in combat.  Bards need to be harder to hit.<P>4) There are stacking issues with some songs but those have been covered in detail.<P>Just try to keep in mind that bards are a generalist class played by people that crave variety.<P>if you want the bard players to be happy the bard is going to have to be a generally useful class at higher levels as well.<P>thanks for reading</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, could you please define what it means to you for a class to be "balanced"?<P>I took it to mean "compelling reason to include this class in a group" and based my post (few pages back) on that assumption.<P>If it means "compelling reason to play this class" then let's be honest: only reason to play is to have fun.  At the very high lvls in order to do that you simply must group, regradless of class, but especialy as a bard.  And where class balance, regardless of definition, really breaks down the most is at the very high lvls.  Therefore, this definition also brings us back to the previous definition.<P>There's another definition of balance to consider though, and that is power relative to the game.  By power, I don't neccesarily mean the ability to inflict damage, or clerics would be unbalanced.  Power means the ability to accomplish goals or even better, the ability to make the game react in the manner you want.<P>This is why you hear complaints about certain quests, particularly the epics, crop up when you ask about balance.  My ability to complete an epic quest is directly related to my power relative to the game. <P>This is why you hear complaints about the lack of soloing ability from certain classes.  Being able to choose whether to group today or spend time soloing is related to my power relative to the game.<P>This is why you hear complaints about the difficulty and amount of time required to travel so often.  My ability to get from point a to point b quickly and safely is directly related to my power relative to the game.<P>In the latter two of these areas, bards ARE relatively balanced.  In the first, they are not.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

These are balanced.<P>Examples that fail to satisfy this condition include damage shields, haste and slow songs, targeted and AE mesmerization.  (Haste would be fine if it stacked with other haste; slow and targeted/AE mez would be fine if they didn't overwrite longer-term superior spells.)<P>Examples that fall ludicrously short of satisfying this condition include Chains, stat buffs, AC buffs, cure poison/disease, and (at higher levels) direct damage.<P>Again, a point that must be repeated because it doesn't seem to have registered yet is that bard songs are not automatically "free" compared to mana-using spells.  There is a whole continuous range of mana efficiency for spells.  At one end, you have spells that give long-lasting, powerful effects for very little mana (e.g. snare, Augmentation, most caster stat/ac/hp buffs).  At the other end you have spells that give very short-lived effects at very high mana cost (e.g. Complete Heal, Ice Comet, Wondrous Rapidity).  Bard songs fall IN THE MIDDLE of this range, requiring very considerable resource investment (equivalent to 1/3 of a mana caster's long-term mana regeneration rate) for an effect that lasts (minus interruptions) for an entire encounter, or an entire downtime between encounters.  Their power should be tuned accordingly.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>The biggest thing that I can think of, balance-wise, is something that others have already brought up, which is mana regen. <P>Specifically, that bards take a /huge/ penalty for being rezzed.  The rez effects are meant to be a penalty, but I don't think they are meant to last for almost an hour, which is the case with the mana being gone for a bard. <P>I find that one of my big roles in a group now that I'm hitting the high levels is to keep an eye out on extra mobs and, when they go and start pounding on the cleric, charm them so that they don't kill the person keeping us alive.  Once charm breaks, the should be well and truly mad at me and ignore that little cleric over there.  This is all fine.  But if we've come back from a wipeout and I've been rezzed, my ability to save the healers is severely hampered. <P>Ultimately, I don't care if I can do my charm more often, or if the desperate dirge (which I don't have yet) sucks up all my mana or not.  I find my mana is pretty much sufficient for most of my uses at the moment.  What I care about is that, in a group situation, after I've been rezzed, I am far less affective.

</FONT><HR>A minor suggestion that would still be very useful:<P>Your Bard code says that, if an instrument is equipped in the secondary slot, nothing can be equipped in the primary slot.<P>Some of the new instruments can be equipped in the Primary slot, allowing us to keep (and use) a secondary weapon, but they still cannot be equipped if an instrument is in the secondary slot.<P>If I want to swap instruments during a fight, I need to do one of two things:<P>1.  Keep two (or more, depending on the number of different instruments I want to use) inventory slots open so I can hotkey them and use the mouse to move things back and forth.  Two problems:  1) at high levels, I have a backpack of food, a backpack of spell components, a backpack of weapons/instruments, a backpack of sellables, two backpacks of resist gear, and two backpacks to allow me to master loot.  I have no slots.  2) If I loot anything, it fills up open inventory slots first, which gets in the way.<P>2.  Hotkey my primary and secondary melee slots and the weapon/instrument pack, requiring me to open and close the backpack when I switch.<P>Switching with no slots open requires 6 steps:<BR>1.  Open backpack<BR>2.  Remove primary weapon.<BR>3.  Swap it with the instrument.<BR>4.  Swap instrument with the secondary weapon.<BR>5.  Put secondary weapon in the backpack.<BR>6.  Close the backpack.<P>Switching with slots open requires:<BR>1.  Remove primary weapon.<BR>2.  Exchange it with instrument in inventory.<BR>3.  Exchange instrument with secondary weapon.<BR>4.  Find some place to put secondary weapon, which may or may not be full now, if I looted something earlier.<P>It would be SO much easier if you could put an instrument in the secondary slot no matter WHAT you have in the primary slot.  To keep things balanced, if you have an instrument equipped in the secondary slot, the primary slot should behave as HTH combat (as if you stored the weapon).<P>This would also allow you to make some higher-level instruments (or even instrument/weapons) which are primary-slot equippable, and would give us the ability to use BOTH instrument effects as required.<P>My computer is much better than the minimum you specify as required, but it is nowhere near good enough for me to bother swapping during combat as it stands.  My mouse control is much too laggy and too slow for me to effectively do this switch in and out every 12 or so seconds.<P>This change would allow those of us who have less-than-top-of-the-line computer equipment to be able to do the same things that (RL) well-equipped Bards can do, and would make it a lot more fun.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"There has to be a pretty serious limitation on songs ('free' is always a dangerous thing when you are talking balance)."<P>I would like to ask then... Why is it that there are items in the game that have better effects than a bard's capabilities then?  For example: The shaman's Jaundiced Bone Bracer... Casts a Direct Damage spell that does somewhere around 300 points of damage.  No recast time that I know of, and only a 8 or 9 seconds casting time on it.  And when it comes to mana... It's free, yet still more effective than Brusco's Bombastic Bellows, which we can only cast once every 5 minutes, and only does like 222 points of damage at it's peak(Assuming it's not completely resisted).<P>Secondly... I would like to point out another quote you mentioned... "it's the newest item to blurr that whole class distinction line."  Aren't bards supposed to be king when it comes to getting the biggest bang for the buck when it comes to "Free" casting ability?  Yet bard songs aren't even better than that 1 item.<P>Thirdly...  I still feel that items like the Singing Steel Bracer should be group only, and buff the whole group with 1 click, much like the effect on the Breath of Harmony.  We are, after all, a group oriented class.<P>And lastly, I think that when a bard reaches a certain level, his songs should be able to be sung in less time.  His skill goes up, he should be able to increase the tempo a bit... Taking maybe 2 seconds to cast his song rather than 1. This would allow a talented bard to twist in 1 more song, allowing him to be a bit more useful in some situations... An alternative that I would like to suggest would be to increase all bard song effects by 1 pulse.<P>When it boils down to it... We are what we sing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Several posts have been placed about these and pretty much ignored from what we as the bard community have been able to see, so I thought to add this here in hopes that we will atleast be heard-<P>Outstanding bard issues:<P>Psalm of Vitality/Purity -<BR>Supposed to cure on random pulses. You guys do realize that it's pointless for us to cure poison with these songs if it takes longer for the random cure pulses to come up than the poison's duration?<BR>Possible solution: Have the songs remove one poison/disease counter every pulse.<P>Psalm series in general are still broken since you broke (on purpose, then fixed a week later) our speed songs. The drum instruments no longer increase the resist bonuses from these songs. We have been continually ignored ever since on this problem.<P>Instruments don't increase haste/slows - Berserker's Crescendo (42), Rousing Rondo (57), Melody of Ervaj (50), Composition of Ervaj (60), Assonant Strane (54), and Anstlich's Assonance (60) all have hastes/slows that are sub-par for their level (i.e. lower level songs are better). They are also all instrument songs (the better hastes/slows are singing-only). It looks like you guys designed these songs assuming an instrument would enhance the haste/slow. Problem is instruments don't do that. I find no need to mention the obvious stacking problems, you have already gotten an ear full on that one.<P>Song of Highsun and Song of Midnight can only be used during daytime and nighttime respectively. Several patches ago you included a message saying Song of Twilight would now be usable any time during the day. Song of Twilight never had a time-of-day restriction on it. Highsun and Midnight are the songs with the time-of-day restriction. Perhaps you meant to remove the restriction from these two songs?<P>Damage/delay ratio on the bard epic weapon is the worst of nearly all of the epics (even the caster epics have better damage/delay). No big deal as I feel the other effects on the epic more than make up for it. But I have to wonder if you guys missed this somehow when rebalancing the epics.<P>Could you re-appraise our mana drain songs (35 and 57)? Tests in PvP (of the level 35 song admittedly) shows it taking about 10 minutes to completely drain a high level player, much less a mob. Instrument does not increase the mana drain either even though an instrument is supposed to be able to be used with the song. The drain rate can effectively be canceled out by Clarity2 (enc) plus Cantana (bard 55).<P>You seem to have a synch bug, where if a mob is mezed/stunned/killed an instant before its gate finishes, the gate still goes off. I've seen it happen with both bard and enchanter mez, with cleric and paladin stuns. One night, we killed a mob with a druid DD, and its corpse finished the gate and appeared at its spawn point.<P>There is also a synch bug noticed most often with bards, that happens with caster buffing as well. If you sing a song to renew an effect that is about to wear off and the renewing takes place, the very instant before the effect that was blinking wore off, then you your renewing attempt fails and is basically canceled. This happens with caster buffs too, but it is a great deal more rare due to how very little they need to renew their buffs compared to a bard renewing a song effect every 18 seconds.<P>The "song ends" "song starts" "song ends" bug is still around. I understand you're aware of it and trying to track it down.<P>If you try to start any of the L51+ songs with a low level player targeted, you get a "target is too low level" message. Our buff songs only affect our group, so there's no need to put this restriction on us. The same applies when trying to start our AE fear (26) with a player targeted.<P>Song of Shields (49) has no message. It went from bad (spamming us with a buff message for each group member), to worse (no message at all).<P>Levitate (31) and Song of Travel (51) don't give any message when they're about to expire. You removed the message to address complaints about the spam (we were constantly getting the message even with the song playing). The correct fix is to increase the duration of these songs by one tick so the message isn't generated for at least one tick, by which time the song's next pulse will refresh it. There is also a problem with the levitation affect range of 31 in a group. I find myself dropping my groupmates in the water no matter how hard I try to stay near them, because its range is so short.<P>There is still the secondary resist on our songs problem. I can send you pics of what I am talking about, but I don't see a way to add them anywhere to this post.  So here is the description of what I mean:<P>1) Bard sings Fulfil's Curtailing Chant(30)and stops singing it as soon as it takes effect. (3.5-5 seconds depending on skill of player)<BR>2) Bard sings Tuyen's Chant of Flame(38)and stops singing it as soon as it takes effect. (3.5-5 seconds depending on skill of player)<BR>3) Bard sings Largo's Melodic Binding (20)and stops singing it as soon as it takes effect. (3.5-5 seconds depending on skill of player)<BR>4) Fulfil's Curtailing Chant(30)ends on cue (18 seconds) and Tuyen's Chant of Flame(38)ends at exactly the same time.<P>Anyone that can do math knows that the second song should never have ended unless, 1) they were sung at exactly the same time, or 2) they get a resist check whenever one ends. These songs cutting out always happens when one song ends. I have once had all 3 songs cut out on me at once, but that seems to be a super rare occurence.<BR>You can switch any of these songs in any manner and get the same results. Its random, and from what I have been able to notice it seems to be right on par with our general resist rate for our combat songs (25-33% or every 3rd to 4th singing of a song). Those resist rates are tremendously high as it is already, giving us secondary resists as well only makes our usefulness in a group even less useful. These songs are just 3 I randomly chose to make the obvious point of what I mean when I say we have a secondary resist problem with all of our combat songs.<P>I know that the main reason Verant doesn't understand or listen too much to us bards is because none of verant has ever played a bard. This may always be the problem and why there is such a gulf between the bard player community and verant. To bad, I don't think it should be that way, but thats life. I say this for several reasons, 1) you leave bugs in our class for more then a year, continually denying their existence, because you never actually played a bard to see the problem (just looked at the code), 2) you know a bug will impact the bard class on a patch, but ignore it and patch anyway and then leave other bugs created by this patch ignored yet again, and 3) you state that you will look at "nerfing" our class just as strenously as you will look at "fixing" our bugs and weaknesses - since our class is the weakest class in the game I find that kind of depressing to hint to us. The truth is we don't want to cheat or have things handed to us, but we do want to feel useful.<P>We as bards are the most skilled and creative players in the game, despite the severe restrictions, disabilities and bugs placed on us we still find ways to be productive. We are shunned in general by the higher level player community (unless we are with close friends). We are left to be by ourselves more then any class should, not becuase we want to be alone but because we have no choices left to us. This is not a good thing for a class that is supposed to be designed primarily for grouping.<P>Aside from all this, I like the bard mostly because it is verants ONLY unique creation in an online fantasy type game and because of the creativity required to play the character. A class that was intended to be totally group oriented and friendly, too bad you were not able to make them that way in practice (you did for their lower levels, but as they get higher this is obviously not the case, especially post 50). I hope you are able to fix this unfortunate reality as it is now. Maybe its just not possible with this game's engine.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi Absor, Hi fellow Bards!<P>Since some of the postings i read so far had to do with the usefulness of bards in highlevel groups i tried think of a possible improvement.<P>so far bard buff's are more or less area buff's that only effect groupmembers. an improvement may be to add a bonus to the songs for each additional groupmember similar to the groupexpbonus. for example a song gives a bard soloing a str bonus of 30, then every groupmember could add 20% to that ( group of a bard with 3 additional people = additional +60% results in an bonus of 48 to str. if a full group the bonus is higher than the highest single cast buff ( like best haste effect ) a bard would have some additional things to provide for the group.<P>another possibility would be some new songs for group use only like<P>- a song that adds 20% to meeledamage ( excluding the bard )<BR>- a song that reduces casting time for spells<BR>- a song that lowers the chance to get stunned<BR>- a song that improves the chance to regain concentration if interupted<P>or something similar. all these would be usefull for groups only and would not render another class useless or step in their territory.<P>i hope so see some nice improvements in the future...<P>Bye<P>Flynn1<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Okay, I haven't read every post, but I have skimmed the majority of them and at this point we are repeating ourselves on a lot of issues, some of which Absor has claimed to have "put on the list."  I don't know if being "added to the list" means the problem/issue we have outlined will be addressed or just noted then round-filed (tossed out), but I'll stay positive and assume that if its on Absor's list, we've made our point and it will be addressed.<P>However, there are still a couple outstanding issues that Absor has not commented upon that I would hope we could "add to the list."<P>Absor has mentioned in previous postings that he doesn't like the blurring of lines between a classes traditional roles, i.e. the Warrior as ultra-combat jockey, the Rogue as the sneaky thief, etc.  In that vein, he has mentioned (realize I'm not quoting here, just paraphrasing) that he doesn't like us having ANY rogue skills.<P>I would accept a nerf that takes away my ability to hide, sneak, pick pockets, find/disarm traps, even pick locks, so long as that reduction in abilities were compensated by the addition of skills with realistic level caps that are more appropriate to our class.  I have read several that I would definitely agree with, with good arguments for them above, and here are some of them:<P>1.  Feign Death:  Whether its the Monk equivalent or one crafted solely for bards, its something that does make sense for our class.  I'm not talking of the monklike, "I possess such perfect disapline I can stop my own heart" kind of Feign death, I am thinking of the more dramatic acting type death as described by one poster above.  I still think it would be more useful than any orgue skill we currently possess.<P>2.  Parry and riposte: Many have made game and technical arguments for their addition at earlier levels and with greater caps than currently exist.  Please refer to them for those sorts of arguments, but the conclusion that seems to be drawn is that allowing bards of lower levels to be able to avoid taking damage would not be overpowering.  I would agree that bash, double attack, and other damage dealing skills are not our province.  But one additional argument I would add for parry and riposte is the fact that, as actors and entertainers, we would learn stage fighting from an early age.  Getting parry at 25-30 and riposte at 40-41 would not be completely out of line, therefore, to balance the rogue skills we lose and/or overpower the other melee classes (I have no idea when others get their skills, I'm not really sure when we get ours except that its late in life.  DO NOT take the suggested levels as a set-in-cement kind of proposal and start flaming, please).<P>3.  Increase forage cap:  Currently, our forage skill maxes out at 55.  That translates to obtaining foraged food about 1 out of every 8 tries, at best 1 out of every 4.  If your vision of bards is this itinerant wandering storyteller/minstrel, we are better scroungers than that.  Raising this cap to 75, 85, 100 would not be overpowering and is a skill we actively use a great deal (indeed, we MUST use it as part of our quest for Nostrolo's Tamborine, a fact that I actually congratulate Verant on!).<P>4.  Increased song effect time:  Absor has already mentioned that this may be addressed.  I hope so, as it is one of the greatest problems that I can see with the bard class.  Even adding a few seconds to effect time would greatly enhance out ability to be useful.<P>5.  Specialization:  I see casters running around specializing in one aspect of magic (abjuration, etc), why not bards?  The obvious lines of demarcation are the various instruments.  Why can't bards decide to specialize in an instrument and then have a greater effect with that instrument's songs?  <P>My reasons for suggesting a whole-hearted cut of our rogue skills is very simple:  I never use them.  I don't find them at all useful.  I have had Hide since creation (wood elves rule!) and aside from hiding from some other players once in a great while, I have never EVER used this skill.  Same with Sense Traps and Sneak.  When I want to move without being seen, I use my invis song.  I have never found any traps with the Sense skill (since the skill only finds mechanical traps and would not find concealed pits, magical traps, etc, I cannot even think of a zone where it would be useful)  I don't have the other skills but I don't see that I would miss them, and would gladly trade them for skills I would use more often, like increased forage skill, feign death (My career on stage is reborn!), parry and riposte.<P>That was one issue.  The other that we seem to harp on that is not on "the list" is our Singing Steel.  Quite frankly, given the tone and degree of resistance Absor has shown to our requests to revamp singing steel, I doubt it will change.  I would just ask that, even if you don't change anything else about the armor (hoping that you instead wisely look at it and revamp it along the lines that have been suggested), you change the BUTT UGLY COLOR!  :-)  I just cannot see my fashion conscious bard wearing puke green armor.  They are the color of surgical scrubs, which is fine to hide the blood we always seem to be shedding, but is otherwise terribly unfashionable!<P>As always, I appreciate the patience of anyone slogging through my looong post!<P>Bright Journey,<P>Odwyn Stormsong<BR>Bard of the Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053745&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053745&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
