</FONT><HR>After reading the quote from the paladin board about defining a weapon style for each melee class i got this real crazy idea, maybe sk should get a skill of some sort that allows them to use a 2hs with a shield (at the same time). This might increase the delay on bash, or might just give an extra automatic bash like atack, which would NOT do alot of damage but would have a great chance of stunning the mob.  At higher lvls it seems sk just cant keep up with the damage output of most other melee classes so we are forced to use a shield to be usefull ( ei more defence and bash) id like to see that change, roleplay wise id picture a paly hiding behind his shield but not a sk.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Somewhere I readed somewhere something like that paladins are the weapon and shield guy while shadowknights (SK) are the twohand weapon user. (I believe Absor or Alan had posted that.) But in that case a shadowknight will give up practically an attack (Bash). How about to give SK the Kick skill. Several races who are eligible to be a SK can not slam (Human, Iksar, Darkelf, Erudite).<BR>And the ones having slam have not worry because Slam is better than a kick due its ability to stun.<P>Elfenfeuer  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>COPYED FROM ANOTHER THREAD<BR>I though this would be better is this thread.<P>This was thought up by Dakker of The Knights Watch message board. The original link can be found here:<BR>http://forums.eqforge.com/shadowknight/showthread.php3?threadid=6957<BR>The idea that was put forward was the following:<BR>OK, an idea for a lvl 60 SK disc that makes us raid friendly, satisfies people's need for evil type illusions, and doesn't step on warrior's toes. As for Leechcurse, ditch it, or make it a new lvl 50 disc or something. <P>To review, Warrior discipline 'Defense' is, at lvl 60, ten minute reuse, 25% reduction in damage output, 40% reduction in damage taken, 3 minute duration. This yields: <P>Shroom King, hits for 250, with warrior disc: 150 <BR>named treant PoG hits for 700, with warrior disc: 420 <BR>ummm...Dain (guessing here) quad hits for 2800, with warrior disc:1680 <P>New shadowknight discipline called, well, Shadow. We have all seen the revenants floating around in the Hole, or iskar ghosts in various places. Discipline Shadow sets your transparency to 50% and grey shades character. This creates the Shadow illusion. Being relatively insubstancial you are now harder to hit. Discipline effect: 15 min reuse (66% as good as warriors), 30% reduction in damage taken (75% as good as warriors), 2 minute duration (66% as good as warriors), obtained at level 60 (5 levels later than a warrior). Since we already do 25% less damage than a warrior, I didn't add a negative damage component as well. <P>Shroom King, hits for 250, with proposed SK disc: 175 <BR>named treant PoG hits for 700, with proposed SK disc: 490 <BR>ummm...Dain (guessing here) quad hits for 2800, with proposed SK disc:1850 <P>The numbers could be tweaked to maintain the same ratio if I have misrepresented the warrior discipline. This should allow 2 hybrids to fill in for 1 warrior on epic encounters, it shouldn't anger warriors who are still the best tanks, and it would actually make shadowknights well, shadowknights. <BR>====<P>It was said by a few that waiting til 60 might be a little long, and that 57 would be much better <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The forum is extremely interesting and the wish lost grows quite long, but I have finally come to the conclusion that the SK may be unsalvagible unless major overhaul is done.<P>At level 45 now I have almost decided to dump my beloved SK in favor of the warrior. I am not a tank, I am not a caster.  The SK is a group filler.  Nothing more, nothing less.  Last night grouped and was shown that I didnt possess the tanking abilities of a Necromancer's pet (necro similar level).  I couldn't even bet hired by a Necro as a Pet.  That is a very sad commentary for such a unique character type. And of course being struck with 113 damage per hit and sometimes being able to Lifetap for 45 hps helped keep me alive (not). Why do SKs have bash (shield) skill that is capped far lower then warriors when warriors never use a shield after the receive duel wield.<BR>A SK is to be 3/4 Warrior, 1/4 Necro.  Lets see the calculations.....<P>A Level 45 SK is really a combination of a 34 Warrior and a 11 Necro... And we gettin ready to go the the planes..... Man that is SAD!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>As a Champion of Fear, Hate, Disease, Darkness, and all that is evil, these are some of the things I would like to see happen with SK's.<P>1) Dump the Undead nukes, they are virtually useless except for maybe pulling.  Why do I want to Nuke Undead anyway, they are my tools not my enemies.  Rather replace it with a Charm Undead line.  That way I could help crowd control. And what do i care if charm pops on me, I am supposed to be tanking it anyway.  This will also allow me to have a worthwhile pet (as you will see later I reccomend dumping the pet line) for short periods of time (because I have yet to meet an SK or Paladin that actually puts points in CHA, though this may create a reason for it).  And it is specialized enough not create an unbalancing factor.  Leave that Undead Nuking stuff to Pallies and Clerics.<P>2) I really like the ideas of Weapon Specialization and the Idea of a quest after the epic to turn it into a 1hs weapon.<P>3) Replace one of our lines of DoTs (Like the Heat blood line, NOT Darkness) with a Disease line of Dots (I just think it is more fitting for the SK)  Though I rarely use the darkness series  as a dot, more of a snare. And usually use only CD due to the amount of resists and mana the higher lvl ones cost.<P>4) We are mean and scary, can't make it any more plain and simple.  Why do clerics fear better than I?  I would like to see our fear line enhanced along with a AoE fear effect (I would glady sacrifice my A0E Weakness spell for this).  This is for RPing mailny, but it could also be used to help with CC when gettin trained by allowing my casters a better chance to gate out and allowing myself a shot at FD.  Not to mention I just royalling PO'd everything off and it now wnats a piece o' me (which is my job in the first place).<P>5) To go along with the Weapon spec thing (since I am a 1h and shield man myself) and being a Defensive class I would like to see some improvements on the defensive skills including dodge, riposte, and the like (especially Bashing, preferably with some type of Stun effect at some point).<P>6) And unlike pally's who do a majority of their casting pre and post battle (with heals and buffs, though they are the stun masters), I cast during battle.  So I would like to see some lower casting times in there somewhere, even if I have to sacrifice higher mana burn for it.<P>7) Also I am intrigued by the apply poison skill that one of my brothers mentioned (do not need to make it, I can always purchase from a rogue) as I can see that as something my SK would have no truck with doing in order to give me that little something extra in battle.<P>8)   Also as another of my brothers mentioned, I would easily give up my pet and invis to UD (though I do really like that spell) for a lich-line of spells that would enhance my own stats and abilities (along with the proper reduction to CHA and the like) as well as make me non-aggro to Undead creatures.  They should both fear and respect me, I am their master after all.<P>I believe none of these things are undoable, and if properly implemented would not effect the balance of the game in any way.  These changes would also make the SK a more viable group member. And give us that certain touch of evil that I think we need without hampering the abilities or usefulness of any other class that we may have to group with.  I also believe that this does not interfere with Verants already conceived notion of what A ShadowKnight is or should be.  It is just gives us a slightly unique flavor in the game.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Besides the spell is so slow attacking it never finishs its duration. <BR>-Fix our Epic we should not need a soul leech or one should drop every time off cazic or have a chance on multiple gods or something, its way too rare.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I think we should getthose 4 exra spells they would make us more versatile and alot more useful in groups. What is that spell that allows necrmancers to give thier mana to other people? that spell alone would make us useful in large scale raids.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is more of a kind of a question/request...  Why do SKs start with extra points in charisma?  If we're so loathed and hated, how come we try to be more charming?  If that's some sort of bug, I'd like to see the 5 taken out of charisma and added into the amount of points you can distribute.  Heck, I'd like it to be taken out of charisma even if it's not a bug :P.  I could have used 5 more strength a lot more than 5 more charisma.  Also, could you consider having some shields do more damage than others, a la Diablo 2?  Such as a shield with spikes doing more damage than just a plain shield.  Also, why not have delays implemented on shields?  Like you should be able to bash faster but do less damage with a basic round shield, and bash a lot harder but then have to wait a bit to bash with a big shield.  Um, one last thing, if we're the masters of disease and such, how about making it so that our disease resist goes up a point every level or two?  It seems logical, and it'd sort of be like how the warriors' magic resist goes up over time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have been argued into RPing into believing D for the SKs from InnoruukSK (has many great ideas)<BR>Well anyways here are my spell ideas<P>Pets, one of 2 things get rid of OR do what I have previously posted about: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053215.html<P>PLEASE READ ALL MY POSTS THERE. MANY GOOD POINTS BROUGHT UP.<P>If you get rid OR even if you don't you should add to SKs a Dmg shield line. IMHO if you don't do anything to pets a DMG shield is WAY better than a pet any day of the week. Make them last long, have HIGH mana costs and pretty good dmg dealt out<BR>RP:I thought SKs had "power", so why can't creatures "feel" this power?<P>Lifetaps, good idea, bad implementation. They get WAY too long to cast. We are supposed to be tanks right? Give us Lifetap DoTs (that are created for SKs, so they can stack w/Necros) in place of Lifetaps. Make them last about 30 seconds and do about 2-3x the healing ability of approxiametly the same level Pallie, but make them cost double, or same as current lifetaps w/inflation.<BR>RP:We drain from creatures their life force, why not do it slower, and more painful?<P>Disease Cloud, one of our best DoTs (I'm not j/k), Give us the ups to these PLEASE<P>REMOVE ALL OUR OTHER DoTs EXCEPT DARKNESS SERIES, They are descent enough and make up for being not the greatest of DoTs. Give us Stackable drains for almost all Stats (including resists), also make packaged drains (ie. str, sta, dex) having higher cost (ie 1/4-1/2 more mana) making em drain less (instead of lets say 20 lets say  about 5-15?) Make some AoE/AE drains, lifetap DoTs.<P>Some Sort of Illusion, that gives faction like Druids wolf form does.<P>At level 60 give us the ability to gain Mana standing at 25-100% the rate of Med. WE ARE TANKS, SO WHAT GOOD IS MED WHEN PEOPLE LAUGH SAYING NEED TO MED?<P>Make the name Everquest "real", besides the fact quests take "forever" to complete, by making quest for spells that are: race, religion, race/religion combo. (for some only one religion combo.)<P>Give us the ability to quest to become specialized in either faster casting times or less mana for spells.<P>REDUCE THE ABNORMALLY LONG CASTING TIMES FOR A TANKING CLASS.<P>MAKE MoBs Either resist spells LESS Or make spells LESS resistable. This helps the fact we are less than a whole class come post game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>That's the thing.<BR> <BR>We're not necromancers. We are the masters of plague,hatred,and fear,surely. It's the three SK deities.<BR> <BR>Plague-which means diseases. The only spell Bertoxx followers get that is "theirs" is Disease Cloud. Infectious Cloud and possibly even a few Disease-based DD's.<BR> <BR>Hatred-We all ubertaunt. Innoruuk is also a "dark" god,so our Darkness line(and being highly necromantic,our lifetap lines) are the right choice. Our taunt skill should be capping at the top of the list. Our spells should be focused towards keeping us at the top of the hatelist.<BR> <BR>Fear-Our method of soloing. Every SK wants nothing more than the pleasure of chasing down their victims and killing them. Slowly. It is the aura of fear that allows us to torment our foes as we do so well. Fear spells should be a part of the SK spell complement from the first day we get spells.<BR> <BR>The SK's purpose is to cause these things and to inflict the greatest misery possible on the opponent,as it pleases our dark gods,whichever one we follow. Hence,we ARE a defensive class-insofar as an SK's primary soloing tactic is fear kiting and wearing down targets with DOT's and our pets...as opposed to nuking the heck out of them or sitting there and attempting to overwhelm them via sheer damage like a warrior.<BR> <BR>What should we be in groups? The hatemonger. Able to draw mobs like a magnet,because we can push ourselves so far up the hatelist it's like everyone else had Evade. We make the mob come to us,we make the mob flee from us,we bury the mob in DoT's and we keep alive with superior defense skills and lifetaps.<BR> <BR>Give us a discipline that lets us cast in battle properly. Optimally,it hastes our spell casting while it lasts and renders us uninterruptable. To a lesser extent,give us superior channeling skills and high Bash caps to allow us to properly deliver our dark powers unto the foe,point-blank where we belong. This would allow us to compensate somewhat for our inferior HP/AC to warriors in the highest levels by allowing full and speedy use of our spells against opponents. If this discipline also allowed us proper chances of landing spells,it'd be perfect (after all,this is meant to be used in-your-face and we're going to taunt the heck out of whatever we hit) ala the resistance-reduction tricks we get with our HT-boosting disc.<BR>  <BR>I have to say that we SHOULD NOT have heightened offensive caps. We prey on the weak. We win by "dirty tactics" and our best one-on-one tactic is invoking utter terror in our foe and striking at his unprotected backside. This is not a style that encourages superior weapons skills.<P>We are the men(and trolls,and dark elves)what wear the black hats around here. Let's act like it.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Also i belive that our bash skill should be upped and add a /dis or crictal hits with shield. btw i always wondered why our shield never gave more ac that the shield as in skill shield parry.<P>I also think our pets are fine but a pet buff spell would be great. pre 50 pets are not worthless in fact i soloed alot with them and without them i couldnt have.<P>Other than that some defense /dis would be nice since we arent damaging class anymore.<P>Sarconus SoulReaver<BR>52nd Reaver</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>When I think of a RPG I think of the possibilities of a role that I can play.  When I think of a SK I see a bearer of death, a person that kills and would not hangout in the back ground taking the damage.  Why is it then that SKs can't match damage with a ranger of the same level?  This is a roleplaying game not a pick your class and try to do everything with them.  Us SKs need to be more offensive, while it may be throught are spells or weapons or just skills somthing needs to be done about are damage.  I would n ot mind taking a defence hit if that would increace the damage that I could do.  The biggest thing that could be done is to move our spells up a few levels and hit us for a little bit of defence.  Thus giving us the abillity to kill more effeciently but we would have to watch our HP more closly.  Please make our pets be able to tank a little, one or two hits and they drop what help is that?  I don't even use my pet because I have FD and am very consevitive.  Up the pets levels or somthing they need help I am starting to feel bad for them.  In closing this is a RPG and we all have roles that are observed now the question is how do you see the SK class?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I've been looking at the discussion, I've been looking at the changes on test, here is my take on the whole mess.<P>The changes on test are very nice, diamondskin should certainly make us a litle more survivable on the big raids, as should the defense caps. However, I feel that our role on alot of the boss level encounters is still non-existant. They gave us better lifetaps, but anything that matters is immune. They made HT save as magic or disease, but most things are immune to that too.<P>The following is a list of mobs that I can not affect with spells at all:<P>Trakanon (I think in the very rare case you can get Boil to stick, but usually a necro will be wanting to tr pyrocuror first)<BR>Venril Sathir (Please tell me what I can do on these raids? I was hoping a disease based HT would make me good for 1 nuke)<BR>Velketor (Can't land squat)<BR>Hoshkar (Same)<BR>Severilous (Same)<BR>Haven't tested if the other dragons are disease immune but all but a handful are magic immune and boil barely ever sticks, assuming it's even worth it. Notably I did full HT damage to Silverwing with Aura.<P>As it is on these mobs I sit there, swing every once in a while and cast steelsking alot. I do minimal damage and given my defensive caps I get hit for alot more than other melee. Alot of necroes are asking that taps be allowed to affect more boss level mobs, I believe that this would be a good thing. Allowing us to output damage as we also increase our tankability.<P>Leechcurse - Great idea as it is, suggested inprovement either make it last 40 seconds (In that time I can maybe if I'm lucky I can do roughly 1k with my ebon mace, or perhaps give us double or triple damage while we use it for the 20 seconds. I'd favor #2 as it would increase our usefulness and damage output when our signature abaility (HT) is useless and allow us to tank a bit longer.<P>Other changes I'd like to see to help our groupability, as it stands we are not very group friendly at all, we are sub-optimal tanks, with all of the necromancer grouping restrictions and none of the perks. I believe our balance lies in making us more useful to other people.<P>Summon Corpse - This was the best idea I've seen in a long time. I fnally have something to give back to my guild. everyone can use this ability at some time or anothe4r. Find me an equal level paladin and we are a full CR crew.<P>Covetous Subversion - On the long raids when we're sitting around at full mana and everyone else is buffing this would be an excellent spell to have. It's horribly mana inefficient, but better than sitting and medding with a full mana bar and given that we don't have the broken mana cycling that necros have available to them, it wouldn't over power us.Just make us more useful to the group as far as decreasing down time in certain situations.<P>Screaming Terror - Currently we have several flavors of fear which can be used as crowd control but are generally suicidal I believe we need something better and this would be in flavor. Every other hybrid gets something, either root or mes for this purpose and I believe giving us something similar would help bring us closer to being balanced groupmates.<P>Root - If we can't have ST, then root perhaps? Given that necromancers have even more roots than clerics, why do paladins get root over us? Even one of the undead only roots would be welcome.<P>Call of Bones - There is a sword from Yelinak that procs this, so obviously this ability wasn't tuled out as a class, but given that the blade is a Yelinak drop it's far below the risk-rewardlevel required to attain it.I suggest givng the blade at least the ratio of an Ebon Mace and making it proc Lich, or better making it a right click for Lich or effect Lich when held. I would also suggest giving us either Call of Bones or Allure of Death to allow us to do or jobs better. Neither spell is something we can really use without backup given the weakness and inefficiency of our dots, especially if you ever make these spells do proper damage. However it would allow us to maintain slightly higher damage output in groups when an enchanter is not available. As it stands I have a great many dots I can't use unless I have clarity available, and if I happen to be the puller, forget doing anything at all, no clarity means I can barely keep up with my FD requirements. Given that both spells are slower than clarity 2, I think these would be a welcome boost without stepping on anyone's toes.<P>DMF - he full version, or a targettable Bobbing Corpse. Both would be useful to the people we group with and cut some of the load on necros when an entire guild needs to be levved for some reason or another.<P>Harm Shield - Would also increase our usefulness and group friendliness in the large raid scenario.<P>A better pact or direct healing spell... any upgrade to dark empathy at all.<P>Defense Caps - I approve.<P>Triple attack, dual wield - Seen a few people request this. I can't really see it Either would make our melee too strong, and increase to our weapon caps would be nice.<P>I don't expect all of the above to be included as changes, the above are just abilities that could help us achieve a slightly more than mediocre level of usefulness in group situations.<P>Our problems as I see it:<P>Low defense<P>Our disciplines spells do little to aid us against the uber mobs, this needs to be changed. I can chain cast a skin and lose most of my melee damage or become food, there has to be a way to do damage and tank somewhat better.<P>Lack of things to bring to a group. Necromancers can heal, transfer mana, provice a little bit of crowd control. We're suboptimal tanks that require heavy support to use even a fraction of our abilities without extreme down time.<P>As I see it we are a generalist hybrid, or should be, even with the above changes we'd still be second to bards in variety of ability. We need to be a little bit more useful in more situations, this would ease the fact that our melee skills suffer so much.<P>Thank you for your time,<BR>Grave Lord Leafweir<BR>Mythic Legion - Druzzil Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Funny...I've been playing my Shadow Knight since week one.  At the time the view was that Shadow Knights were 50% tank 50% caster.  And so you could slant your character one way or the other at creation.  So I created a Dark Elf Shadow Knight and put the points in INT.  So now I'm a 49th level "smart" Shadow Knight, created by a "dumb" player.  Saying an SK is 75% tank 25% caster is misleading.  An Shadow Knight IS a tank (and worse than a warrior at tanking defensively), with TOKEN casting.  I just about cry playing next to these Ogre SKs who got some hit points and can deal some  damage.

</FONT><HR>I play a Ogre SK and the reason I picked that race/class combo and not the DE SK was so that I could BASH with a 2hs weapon.  I do not think that implementing more 2hs weapons that enable a small race to bash is fair.  You knew going into being a DE or a Human etc SK that you COULD NOT Bash with a 2 handed weapon.  Deal with it.  This thread is about class balance not race balance.  BTW I pay a experience penalty to bash with a 2hs weapon.  You dont.  If you implement more 2 handed weapons that enable you to bash I want my experience penalty removed since it will no longer be a advantage to a large race. There it is.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I don't see how... not only could you slam, your racial bonus, but then you could bash, as if you had a shield, and still deal out 2h* damage.<P>How does this NOT work to your advantage?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have one question which applies to some shadow knights, some necromancers, but mostly iskar. Why is it that we kill creatures that look like iskar skeletons and raise a creature that looks like a dead human or an elf? I'm hundreds of miles from the nearest dead elf, yet here he comes to laugh at my side. It'd be nicer if he was there to help me in battle, but I'm happy to accept the companionship. Often he's the only group we can find. I'd say let everyone summon those iskar skellys on kunark or let iskar summon iskar pets anywhere.<P>I'd love to make mention at this point on my opinions about offense and defense (SK Offensive, Pally Defensive), but the live changes show that Verant already thinks of the shadow knight as nothing but a weak clone of the paladin, not worthy of seperate consideration for skill increases.<P>Xar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am trying to think what would really help us find a role within group, but still keep us inline with what our defined role as a defensive hybrid would be.<P>If we are to be a defensive hybrid as is stated repeatedly, I would think it would make sense for sks to have the following additions and changes:<P>Corpal Empathy - If we are a defensive hybrid we should really have some more upgrades in this area because dark empathy is really lacking.<P>Ignite Blood - make boil blood avaliable at an earlier level and insert ignite blood around 56 or 57. <P>I would also love to see a spell or discipline that allows us to fight while invisible for a short duration of time and makes us totally immune to attacks while invisible.

</FONT><HR>Here it is short and sweet:<BR>1.Increase Bash skill<P>2. Allow us a form of weapon specialization so that we could raise one or our weapon skills to that of a warriors, either 1hs 1hb 2hs or 2hb.<P>3. Lower cast time on our higher lvl spells, we are a melee class we should be able to cast while in combat. It is impossible to do this with the 6 and 7 second cast times now. We are not casters standing in the back with all the time in the world to cast.<P>4. Lower resists to our spells. What is the use of us having spells if they never stick.  At the end that would really just make us 75% warrrior since our spells are useless.<P>Thats all, hope you guys will bring up some of these issues in your talks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>   I have read alot here and have some Ideas of my own.<BR>  First of all, the idea of any tank being made in a defensive roll is not realistic.  I could agree with it if we were all on the same side but we are not.<BR>  The idea of Inny making SKs to defend warriors and rangers is far fechted.<BR> <BR>  I belive all tanks should be intended to be offensive but just not in the say way.<BR>  I think all tanks should have the same caps and its spell styles and disciplines that seperate our way of fighting.<P>  WARRIORS<BR>  I see warriors as they are now being able to dish out damage to ANYTHING they come across but might not just be the best at any one thing compared to specialist (Hybrid) which I will go more into in a bit.<BR>  Warriors should have Disciplines like they do now but I think they should be spread more through out there lvls to give them somthing to look foward to like casters/hybrids do.<BR>  I think all disciplines should have there own reset time with a about a 2 min pause between seperate disciplines useages.<BR>  THAT would really make the difference between warriors and Hybrids.<P>  RANGERS<BR>  I see rangers close to what they are not (see above for cap changes for all tanks) BUT they should beable to crit animals/plants and giants at a 30% crit increase compared to warriors.<BR>  After all they are the woodlands specialest.<BR>  They should some week buffs they can put on others but when cast on themselfs they STACK therefor not make half there spell ability usless the sec a druid (mage when it comes to damage shields) enters the group.<BR>  I would talk about Disciplins for rangers but I havent really studied them in that area so not going to blow smoke about that.<P>  PALADINS<BR>  This Knights specialty is EVIL and there minions.  They should always have had the ability to crit undead but at a 30% increas over warriors.<BR>  I dont think this is over balancing since it is really restricted to one form of mob.<BR>  I think they should have week buffs but should be STACKABLE or some self buffs that are STACKABLE instead of making a whole line of spells useless if a cleric is in the group which is most of the time.<BR>  Make some undead only damage shields that stack with other damage shields, self only or group up to you.<BR>  Just give Paladins spells that are made for a defender of the faith that goes hand to hand therefor the would have to be fast casting to make good use of combat style spells.<BR>  HOLY FORGE Descipline should be really somthing special.  I can see it up for 5 min and while it is up boost all physical abilities by 10.<BR>  Reduce there damage coming in by 30% and adds some anti resist to there spells and works like it does now for undead.<BR>  For only having 4 desciplines they should really be great but only if you gave desciplins their own reset time so warriors are now very effective in there own way.<P>  SHADOW KNIGHTS<BR>  This class I see as the dirty asassin/fighter who will do anything to get the job done for his god.<BR>  I dont see SKs with the crit ability for they really dont have a special foe and I dont think GOOD counts for that purpose.<BR>  But I do see them with ability to do a DEADLY STIKE.  This ability would hit harder then the rogues backstap or warriors crippling blow but would only happen once in a while.  Maybe once per mob or 2 depending on how long a fight is and dex rating of char.<BR>  SKs really need there own spell line and not made useless the sec a necro enters the group.<BR>  Any self buffs they get along the necro line should be based on the SK lvl not the necro some time back.<BR>  The idea that a 50th lvl SK not draining 20 str with syphion str is just plain silly.<BR>  I saw that on test we are getting grim aura which will increas sk atk by 6.  LOL what high lvl SK is going to waste a spell slot there, then again maybe some would I have a 55th lvl sk and there is only a few spells I even bother with.<BR>  But spells of that nature should be lvl based, even if its a 1pt increas per 2 or 3 lvls.<BR>  Sks should have there own line of spells. <BR>  Where Necros have the HUGE dots and such I could see SKs with dots a third the size but do all sorts of debuffing, after all we are going hand to hand and weaking the opponent as well as doing DOT damage is more in line with us.<BR>  I suggest a third the damage cause of all the debuffing ability of such spells which dould do anything to stat loss and resist ratings to slowing the mob.<BR>  If you dont want SKs to have such debuffing dots then I suggest dots that are compared to the lvl of the SK and the damage output of the avg weapon for that lvl.<BR>  If it wasnt for Boilblood I wouldnt even cast dots, when you compare weapon output compared to your dot which is spell casting time/resist/interupt/fizzle rate  it has to be worth it.<BR>  We should get more spells that are poison and disease based and combat spells should be fast casting.<BR>  I think all the shroud spells should be a proc in effect.<BR>  I wouldnt mind spells like Banshee Arua if it was stackable but as it is it takes up a slot.<BR>  I dont belive in giving spells to hybrids that will not be used cause of the lvl they are now given at, I have a ae spell at 49 that made me laugh to see it.  It should be useful or not be there and I dont want to hear about finding a use for it like running to crushbone and killing orcs at 49.<BR>  HARMTOUCH<BR>  Heh I still see some crying about HT, ppl want more damage and such, well you can only do so much befor you are at a point where you now really hurt mobs but drop Players like flies and that is NOT the way to go.<BR>  The only think I could see being done to HT is make it a life tap or it does the damage it does not but gives us half a life tap out of it.<BR>  Were not going to kill most mobs with it but anything that will help us live longer to fight another day should be wanted<BR>  UNHOLY AURA should be somthing special just like holy forge.  I see it reducing the damage we take by 30% and raising resist and stats by 10. <BR>  Add some anti resist to spell casting and raising our attack defense ratings.  Maybe instead of raising our resist up since we are SKs make us immune to Fear and Life tap line spells and or diseas poison spells to.  Ya it sounds like alot but hell its one of 4 desciplins so should be somthing special. Maybe its doubles the effect of banshee arue if its up or life taps on its own, you come up with some ides here to.<BR>  But agian I would only do it if all desciplines had there own reset time so that warriors could get full use of ALL there disciplines.<BR>  LEECH CURSE, Not sure here, but needs a upgrade.<BR>  Maybe when it is up we always hit and we get health back and take less damage.  Maybe it works for the hits we take instead now that would be good to, many combos or things could be done here.  But no matter how you do it should be compared to what Unholy arua does.<P>  In general all tanks should have the same caps but it should be special abilities/spells/disciplins that seperate us.<BR>  No use being a tank if you cant hit the mobs and defensive does NOT kill the mob, just makes us die slower but you will die.<BR>  The bottom line is damage output and having a class you can feel pride in at the end of the day.  Doesnt matter if your a generalist or specialist as long as you excel in some area and go oh ya here is where I kick ass, that is what player is looking for at the end of the day.<BR>  I dont mind if a paly or warrior out does me here or there as long as I get to out do sombody some where else and go OH YA THIS IS MY DAY TO KICK ASS.<P>  I dont like the idea of classes being guided to one area of fighting, should be two areas per class at least so that a player has a CHOICE in there fighting style.<BR>  <BR>  I wote this post in hast so not sure how well it is written or if it gave any of you food for thought but I wish you all the best and hope our class sees some impovements that we can feel pride with. <P>   HARUCHAI<BR>   55 lvl Shadow Knight<BR>   If your not a preditor your pray.<P>   Towers of Elysium<BR>   Saryrn Sever</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>With regards to offensive spells, Shadow Knights either need thier own spell line that are not overwritten by a necro (suchs as the dots) or more spells from the necro line that have an immediate damage or effect.  Not only that, but the spells should be for the full effect, not some watered down, highly mana intensive version.<P>With regards to defensive spells, we need the shielding line of spells, and get the skin line(steelskin, diamondskin etc.) earlier and spaced out more evenly.<P>With regards to our offensive ability, we need to a higher skill cap on bash, and higher weapon skills.  I could accept only 1 weapon skill being allowed to be specialized in.<P>With regards to our defensive ability, raising defense was a step in the right direction.  If we are a defensive class (which I disagree with) then parry, and dodge skills should also see an increase as well as hitpoints.<P>Harm Touch should always work of a change made to Unholy Aura (see below).  Its a useless skill against boss mobs, and for that matter, anything more than 2 levels above us, and questionable on anything within 5 levels below us.<P>Our disciplines are another can of worms completly.<P>Unholy Aura is basicly gutless.  Since Harm Touch resist is checked that same as if it were a lifetap now, this means that half the original effect of this discipline has been nuetured.  If you are really going to do us a favor here, make the use of Unholy Aura cause the Harm Touch to be unresistable at all, even on a boss mob.  By level 54, asking for that kind of power is not out of line whatsoever.  Make a bloody quest out of it in order to get the discipline if you must.<P>Leechcurse should be changed such that half of the damage you receive is converted to a lifetap effect.  You are healed and the attacker is hurt.<BR>You take a 100 damage hit, you recieve 50 hitpoint heal, and the attacker takes 50 hitpoints of damage.<P>Dreads<BR>Unholy Knight of Cazic-Thule<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1. My character is a knight. As a knight he considers attacking disarmed opponent dishonorable.<BR>Thats for the role playing aspect. In practice Disarm skill is practically useless. Even when disarmed the mob hits for the exact same amount of hit points. This skill is completely impractical and serves no purpose.<P>2. Some people suggested that SKs get Illusion Skeleton spell. I disagree. That would make us almost exactly the same as Necromancers. Were not. Instead Id like to see a ILLUSION GHOST spell. This spell would turn the SK transparent (like all the ghost in the game are) it would proc Stun to reflect the paralyzing fear that the victim feels or give us the ability to levitate.<P>3. Debuffing spells such as Siphon Strength do not seem to have much effect on mobs. If I siphon a mob and the use my DarkReavers Strength leach the attacking mob will still hit the same.<P>4. SKs miss too much. Last time I was fighting I had 6 misses in the row. In the mean time the mob I was fighting landed 7 hits in a row (it was a low blue cat in Iceclad Ocean) . To say the least at 60+ hps per hit my SK was hurting. Currently my SK has a skill of 190 in 1hs, 1hb and 2bs. <BR>Let me put it in another terms. Run up to your little brother and kick him in the butt. See if you miss<BR>This has nothing to do with balancing just common sense.<P>5. Armor. Someone said it before, Ill say it again. DF is next to impossible to get. <P>6. We need a mid range quest two handed sword. How about a Blade of Darkness it would be the opposite of the paladins SoulFire. It would emit a dark flame and proc lifespike or Lifedraw and have the same stats at the paladin weapon.<P>7. Spells get resisted left and right. I find it quite humorous to see a low blue cougar resist 3 or 4 Darkness and Blood boils in a row. Thats until it gets into attack ranger and tears me to shreds.<P>8. Pets suck a lemon. I havent used a pet in ages. Its not even a low level dot. <BR>It hits from 1 to 5 damage at the most. During a fight that may extend to 40 hps in total. Either loose the pet or fix it. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The post 50 SK & PAL classes are in need of attention.  <BR>Groups hunt for exp. What is required to get exp ?<BR>Kills. What is required to kill ? DMG and lots of it.  What two melee classes have the least dmg output ? SKs and PALs. Is there something wrong with this ? No. After all SOME classes have to be at the bottom. SKs and PALs are there. I only object to the DEGREE to which SKs and PALs lag behind.  Why do they lag so far behind ?<BR>--they are the ONLY 2 melee classes without dual wield, post 50 dual wield just rocks , pure and simple<BR>--they are the ONLY 2 melee CLASSES without an extra attack (rangers/warrior-Kick, Rogue-Backstab,Monk-flying kick)<BR>--they have the lowest offense skill of any other melee class<BR>--they have the lowest weapons skill of any other melee class<BR>--not sure if this is true but ive seen it many times, apparently SKs and PALs use a different melee table when calculating dmg done and hits/misses, SKs and PALs have the least favorable table<BR>--warriors add crits/crippling blows and 55+ stun kicks<BR>ALL of these factors are CUMULATIVE and result in an enormous disparity in dmg output.<BR>Absor was under the impression that a sk and pal could do 2/3 the melee dmg of a warrior, i think it's more like 40-45%.  If this is the case, and i urge verant to test this, then we are doing 40 % less dmg than Absor thought we were and this should not sit well with him.<BR>What should be done?  A couple possibilities.<BR>--raise weapon and offense skills (10-15 pts each)<BR>still well below the pure melees and without the other factors in dmg output cited above we're still well behind the pure melees in offensive prowess<BR>--allow SKs/PALs to specialize in ONE weapon skill <BR>These 2 possibilities only adjust ONE of the 4 factors given for other classes having melee superiority.  And this adjustment doesnt even match the other classes in this one category.<BR>Why write a long post to adjust one factor upwards only slightly ? Because the 'great whiffing sound' needs to end, SKs and PALs are missing far too much than is reasonable.  <P>Someone might object that we're a defensive class and dont deserve any offensive adjustments. <BR>I answer: <BR>--We still wont dual wield, we still wont have an extra attack, we will still melee at a disadvantage due to being on a different melee table, and we will stil have lower offense and weapon skill caps.  Is that not enough of a handicap on our offensive abilities ?<P>A few other short points:<P>Many people think that the adjustment to our defensive cap wil allow us to tank as well as warriors. Not so. Why ?<BR>--warrior equipment has higher AC <BR>--warrior defense skills (parry,riposte,dodge)<BR>are 70pts higher<BR>--warriors have more hps<BR>--warriors have the best defensive discs <BR>I suspect that even on the test server rogues get hit for less dmg and less often than sks/pals post 50, certainly post 55 (rogues who happened to be the most offensive class in the game seem to be second in defense)<P>Some Observations: <BR>#1 The difference in AC between SK/PAL platemail (BE/DW) and Warrior platemail (Cobalt) is 43; the difference in AC between PAL/SK platemail and Rogue/Ranger (Mrylokar/Tolan's) is 22.  Why is their TWO TIMES the discrepancy in AC between two platemail armors than between a platemail and a chain armor?<P>#2 We were classified by you (Absor) as a defensive hybrid.  Why then are we the only hybrid without a viable defensive discipline ?  Not to criticize rangers, but rangers were classified by you, and thier skills reflect this, as an offensive hybrid, but yet they get a viable defensive disc ? Explain.<P>#3 Vampiric embrace has had it's lifetap processed nerfed relative to the necromancer spell because to keep it as is would be too powerful.  Why then is there a non-sk spell , Boon of Garou, which enables ANY class to lifetap MORE than vampiric embrace ?  Vampiric embrace is overriden by this spell.  Why was it overpowering to give to SKs, one of their few useful class abilities, and not overpowering to allow an enchanter, which is in almost every exp group, to give it to any class ?  The truth is it's not overpowering. Dont nerf the boon of garou spell, u should upgrade the sks proc.<P>#4 Stacking Issues<P>Shroud of Pain does not stack with Speed of the Shissar<BR>Shroud of Hate does not stack with Visions of Grandeur<P>Finally , a few spell suggestions:<BR>1) Banshee aura should stack with all other dmg shields. It's self only and to hit a high lvl sk should cause more pain to the attacker than to hit any other class i would think.  It's analagous to Ranger's bramblecoat stacking with thornshields.<P>2) Sks need a useful dot.  That is , fast acting and can do a little dmg.  I suggest venom of the snake for this.  It's a poisoned based lvl 34 necro spell, hardly overpowering but would be very useful because it does about the same dmg as blood boil but does it in half the time.<P>3) a) SKs simply dont have any POTENT debuff spells.  It would seem that a sk should be able to weaken it's opponent with nefarious magic.  I would suggest giving the SK the scent of darkness series up to the lvl 39 necro one.  A very group friendly spell, much needed by sks. Please note though it is highly resistable and hence not too powerful (because of this i dont think necros use this spell much).<BR>  b) along the same lines, i would suggest an upgrade to siphon str, maybe steal str.  To siphon 25-30 str + asystole u might see some difference in how hard a mob hits, maybe.<P>4) This fourth suggestion is a tricky one.  Either be very aware that we dont have ANY way to park mobs, no root or stun, or give us this ability.  Our parent caster class gets both root and a stun.  It's not out of our field of magic to have this ability.  If we are not to get it, please be aware that it's a powerful ability we do not have.<P>5) A spell that turns a SK into a skeleton, castable ONLY at night and would grant him her + 100 atk/-100 AC or something that ups offense and lowers defense.<P>Oh, and one more thing, hehe.<P>It has never made sense to me that when a hybrid is grouped with its parent caster it is a DETRMINENT. I think there should be a SYNERGISTIC effect when a hybrid groups with the Master of it's school of magic.  Hence, i suggest Necros, Druid, and Clerics have a buff for their respective hybrid counterpart.<P>Thank you Absor and VI for making these efforts (the class threads) to continue to improve this awesome game.<BR>The pal and sk classes are underpowered imo.  I think the truth of this is reflected in their numbers post 55.<P>Thanks for your time and consideration.<P>Maljenta Apollyona<BR>Lvl 56 Shadow Knight<BR>Altera Vita , Xev<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055531-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055531.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055531-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055531-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055531-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055531-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055531&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055531&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
