</FONT><HR>However you want to measure it, I just set a new personal record.  Halas to Iceclad (by the Highpass route) edges out Qeynos to Butcherblock in number of zones.  And, this time I didn't get a tp: 2 hours and 20 minutes total.<P>Pulled a GLS out of the bank.  Saved a newbie from a vengeful soloist in Everfrost.  Went down to the river in WK, lined myself up directly east, and smoked a cigarette on autorun (finished the cig before I finished the zone).  Killed Chief Sanre-whatever in EK barehanded.  I was hoping for xp since he aggroed, but no luck.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">  Got to Highpass right after nightfall, of course.  Pulled a sow potion and an invis potion out of the bank in Highkeep, and watched some tv.  Got a bind in Freeport (we'd tp'd straight to Iceclad from NK on Sunday; the wizzie picked me up there after a weekend Perma raid).  Bought some muffins and milk, since my stamina bar was empty (it takes awhile with 115 sta, but it happens eventually).  Waited for the raft from NRo.  Waited for the boat from the sandy island.  Drank the sow potion on the dock.  Drank the invis potion just before leaving the first island, since I'd discovered the hard way (again) that warriors just aren't meant to travel solo in zones where nothing is green yet.  Looted my corpse on the ice floes between the second and third island, where I had been cut down by a dire wolf and a shadow guardian on my way to Eastern Wastes (I really need to remember to solo explore with my druid, that's why I made him).  Ran back to the iceberg near the dock and camped (not at the dock itself, since I'd learned a few trips ago that bad habits from Oasis die hard, and people will train to the docks in Iceclad even though 9 times out of 10, to make up a random number, it just gets the people there killed).<P>Fairly uneventful as cr's go, just really really long.  How about you?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Tudan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My longest was from East Freeport to East Commons, NRo, Oasis, SRo, Innothule, Feerott, Rathe Mountains, Lake Rathtear to Southern Karana.  I didn't go the Kithcor and High Pass route because I was still KOS thru there and it was before I hit 30 and got Gather Shadows.  After runs like that I don't fear death anymore, it's mostly just an inconvenience.  Nowadays I'm routinely visiting under Qeynos and Everfrost but still bound in Freeport.

</FONT><HR>well, longest corpse retrieve hmmmmm not sure if this can be said but I had one that all together took me 5 days to get my stuff back. I'll explain<P>first  when kunark came out I was one of the probley thousands that got lucky and got there first  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> just to die not more then 10 min's I was there. not thinking me and some people just decided to run out into the tundra and just start killing stuff WRONG!!!!! we got our butts handed to us, and it took me about 5 days of running back and forth just to get my stuff back. Ya see I normally play when theres not very many ppl on so getting a bind is like getting water in a desert not very easy. so me being bound in perma was not a good thing. also being a barb warrior is also not a good thing is some zones. basicly I would get my corpse and in the process of trying to get out of there I would get killed again and again and since I was 32 and a warrior trying to solo anything in FV is just suicide. also without sow it's kinda hard to run away from a mob thats blasting you and rooting you. so in the process of just trying to get my first corpse, I think I died about 100 times altogether and yes I lost 32 and most of 31, because of this. lucky I logged on on the 5th day and there was some higher lvls on like 50-55 and they buffed the living piss out of me and escorted me to my corpse. then I got a bind in FV after that and things started looking up. I'll tell you that was the worse week I've ever had playing EQ.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Umm, two nights ago a guildmate fell into The Hole.  She was a level 20 shaman, and suicide jumps from a disgarded L9 wizard managed to get me to the bottom safely after some very, very well timed fades.  Otherwise it is a 10K fall, anyhow, I got the damage down to 33.  Getting this character and such there took about 40min as is.  But, when I got down there, I was alive for about a tenth of a second before I saw the text: Master Yael says "DONOTACHA!".  Hehe, just her luck to fall into the den of a Uber-mob, a L56 magician with only 24,000 hps, and a big bad pet of course.  We finally managed to get a necromancer that could summon corpse to the site.  All but one on our server were on a PoG raid.  Immediately our necromancer goes link-dead, DOH.  After a few minutes, this kind soul comes back, and I port  (I am a mid level wizzy) him to Nektulous forest to buy the 2 175pp coffens required to cast the spell.  We get there, and the necromancers (up to 2 now) are able to squueze through the small crack present.  Myself and the barbarian shaman however were not, so, I managed to find a rogue willing to help, so off we go to Gfay to pick him up.  I get back with the dwarven rogue though, and he opens the entrance.  We all swim through and zone.  Immedaitely after zone, something happens to my PC underwater and I am getting about 1 frame every 3 seconds, and stuck underwater.  After about 2 more minutes, I manage to get up to the ledge, as much pure luck as anything.  The necromancer summons the corpse, and she loots, next corpse summoned, and she loots all her gear she had almost lost.  I can's see anything but text at this point, and I am going only off sound and text, but still lagging more than 4 lines of text.  The EQ client was stalled really, not even crawling.  Anyhow, I managed to type /cast 6 as my evac spell, and when I was out of the dungeon, everything worked great again.  So, this was a 7 hour corpse recovery for me(L35), at least 10 for my guild-mate(L20), about 60 minutes for one of the necromancers(L52), about 45 minutes for the other necromancer(L60), about 25 minutes for the rogue(L50), and about 350pp for the spell reagents needed to summon the corpse.  All in all, a very different experience.  BTW, levitate is canceled on that zone, so you still splat for 10K, we tried it.  I want to thank all three kind individuals that helped us on Terris-Thule, we owe you big.<P>Azlinon Seflarian<BR>&lt;Divine Symphony&gt; Guild Leader<BR>Wizard of the 35th circle<BR>Terris-Thule<BR>www.angelfire.com/rpg/divinesymphony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ok, i have a story that some of you on Luclin may have heard. (many thanks to the human female monk and the erudite necro i think... have you names written down at home  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> )<P>  It's not a long run from the gates of Halas to the warren at Blackburrow... once.  In my 5th season of adventuring, my guildmaster informed me that the gnolls of Blackburrow were infested our beloved land of Everfrost.  Being a loyal Wolf of the North, I went hunting gnolls right away.<BR>  Well, it was here that I learn to first distrust the foreigners from the south.  A paladin who didn't help with trains, a druid who was so wet behind the ears his knees were wet (really enthusiastic and friendly though...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ) and eventually a cleric who couldn't keep up with healing the paladin pulling trains like mad.  Of course the dungeon crawl was doomed.<BR>  I revived thanks to the gods kindness outside the gates of our beautiful ice and snow covered city of Halas, and started running back toward Blackburrow.  On the way I was met by a vengeful soloist (hi Jagr, hope you found yours!) who ended my life again.  A kind shaman of many seasons imbued my feet with the spirit of the wolf, so I could run past the vengeful musicians who roam the mountains of Everfrost; she also gave me serpent sight so I could see the gnolls attacking from the darkness.  On the way into the tunnel, I met a southern Necromancer who made me invisible so I could run past the dangers in the tunnel, and a southern Monk who helped fight past the gnolls.<BR>  I made it back to my group and tried again.  Sadly, the results were similar.  In the end, I learned to run through Blackburrow naked, in the dark.  And I have vowed to never again trust southern tactics in the warrens of Blackburrow.<P>Telson <BR>5th Barbarian Warrior<BR>Luclin<P>P.S. in the end I had a drink with the Necromancer and I am now camped by the tunnel to Blackburrow, hopelessly drunk!  All in all a fun, but frustrating 4 hours. (and I levelled 5th, 4 times)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ahh, the title of this post just brings back memories...<P>At about level 17-18, I was bound in GFey by Orc Lift as some friends and I planned our revenge on Dvinn.  AFter sucessfully accomplishing our goal for the night, everyone in the group logged off except for me.  I decided I was going to explore a bit so I was off to BB to catch the boat to Kunark for the first time.  I eventually made it to Fiorna Vie and somehow ended up in Lake of Ill Omen.  At this point I was terrified, as most MoBs were red to me.  Especially frightening were the Sarnak Recruits and Gobbies.  I began to wander around and couldn't believe how HUGE this zone was! After about 30 minutes of running around fearing for my life, I see a glimmer of hope ahead, a tunnel, which I thought at the time was a zone.  It turns out this "zone" was actually the goblin caves.  Well after completely losing my orientation within the maze, I get hit hard by some Lord something boss a couple of times and...<BR>LOADING PLEASE WAIT...<P>It wasn't until GFey loaded back up when I realized I had not rebound myself in Fiorna Vie.  Uggh.  To make matters worse, I had been playing for hours and was dead tired.  But there was no way I was going to bed, I HAD TO GET MY BODY!  It took me another 3-4 hours just to find the goblin caves again, at that point a nice higher-level monk found and dragged my body out for me to loot.  Finally!!  Shortly thereafter, I heard my phone ring.  It was my boss. Puzzled, I looked at my clock and couldn't believe what I saw! 9:15 AM!!  I was 15 minutes late for work. 15.5 straight hours of playing EQ.  And I thought I was just gonna kill Dvinn and log...<P>Moral of the story:  Always bind yourself!!<P>This may not be the longest corpse run, but in terms of time spent, and the overall terror factor, this corpse run easily takes the cake for me!  =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Longest in distance would be Lake of Ill Omen to Qeynos Hills. Doesn't really count for a druid though, since effectively that's North Karana to Qeynos Hills.<P>Two complete failures:<P>Level 5, fell down the hollow tree in BB. Two more deaths trying to get the body back. Gave up and didn't play the character for a month or more. (That counts as most upsetting, although now I realise that being distraught because I'd lost some cloth armor, a cracked staff and a couple of plat might have been a slight over-reaction  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>Level 20ish First day in Kunark, went exploring in Firiona Vie (something I would not do with a character under about 50th level now). Died in the Froglok camp, twice more trying to reach my body. Gave up and went out to get a complete new set of kit.<P>But the most difficult...<P>probably dying in West Karana while AFK in Treeform. Did you ever notice how many trees there in West Karana? And how the whole place looks the same? Fortunately I had a Greater Lightstone in my offhand when I died and I turned out to be the only tree that glowed in the dark.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well this wasn't a corpse run but I'll post anyway.  Trying to get from Butherblock to Freeport by boat.  Not too long a trip right? Well that's what I thought until I went LD on the boat. (I was on a dial up connection at the time)  So I dial up, log on, wait for boat, get on boat... LD.  Again I dial up, log on, wait for boat, get on boat... you guessed it, LD.  Took me easily 3 hours to get from Butcherblock to Freeport.  And by the time I actually made it to Freeport I had to log.  What a fun day of EQ that was.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum10&number=10&thisthread=004937&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum10&number=10&thisthread=004937&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
