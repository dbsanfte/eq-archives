&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>About these lists:<P>First and foremost, understand that this is only a list of concerns to be brought to the Live Team.  This is not a list of promises, and I'm certainly not telling you that any or all of these items will be changed or implemented.<P>Also, there are three types of items that I don't have listed here.  Epic Quests, Magic Resistances in Velious and Mid-level quests.  Those three items were mentioned by enough classes that I've pulled them out for separate examination.<P>All items are currently marked with NONE for status.  Obviously we've already started working on some items, you've seen the lists from the patch messages on the Test Server.  I will be updating the status for items early next week to reflect those potential changes and with any responses from the team.  I just wanted to get these lists out to you fresh.<P>I want these lists to be final as you see them now, but I know there will need to be changes made.  So this list is not final.  But if you want something added to or removed from the list, please be convincing about the change.  At this point I don't want to tack on too many more items, since the team is already reviewing the original list.<P>Thanks for the input so far.<P>Alan<P><BR>Rogues:<P><BR>ITEM:  Evade.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Evade was broken when the size of the hate list was expanded for NPCs.  It has to be fixed this in such a way that there won't be too much of a change from the way that Evade worked prior to the hate list change.  This will, however, 'nerf' the skill a bit compared to how it works now.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Damage Shields and missiles.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Thrown weapons will cause a damage shield to damage the thrower.  This seems wrong from a constancy standpoint, especially since damage shields do not cause damage to an archer in this fashion.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Locked Chests.<P>DESCRIPTION:  It would be nice if locked chests were introduced into the game.  Making them static would, obviously, be pretty silly.  But they could drop off NPCs.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Report Backstab messages to the group.<P>DESCRIPTION: It seems like this might be able to boost morale and allow the rogue to be even more impressed with his own skills.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">   If this is added, though, it would be good to also add a filter for it to reduce spam.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Sneak and Hide functionality.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Hide is cancelled when you loot, shop or trade.  But the buttons don't 'ungray', and you don't get a message that tells you that you've stopped hiding.  Perhaps this could be changed.  And perhaps sneak could break in the same fashion, since sneak currently does not break in these circumstances.  Perhaps consistency here would be good.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Haste for missile weapons.<P>DESCRIPTION:  How about allowing haste to affect the speed at which weapons are thrown or bows are fired?<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Illusion Masks.<P>DESCRIPTION:  The illusions can't be clicked off by the wearer.  Is this intentional?<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Hide/sneak overwriting invisibility.<P>DESCRIPTION:  As it is now, when any invisibility spell (including invisibility to undead and bard songs) wears off, a hidden rogue will become visible.  The wearing off of the invisibility spell also takes out the rogues hide invisibility.  Is this as it was intended?<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Increased Safefall.<P>DESCRIPTION:  How about increasing the safefall skill cap.  Not enough to overtake monks, but enough to allow a bit more leeway for the running rogue.  A slight increase for post level 50 rogues might be in order.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Sneaking in water.<P>DESCRIPTION:  For some reason you can sneak and then move into the water and continue to sneak.  But you can't begin to sneak if you are in the water.  This should be consistent.  Either sneak breaks when you enter the water, or you can start sneaking while in the water.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Stackable Poisons.<P>DESCRIPTION:  This is a pretty common request.  They would like stackable poisons, or perhaps the ability to make multi-charge poisons.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Poisoning in Full Screen mode.<P>DESCRIPTION: It seems that applying poisons can't be done in full screen.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Sneak skill increases.<P>Sneak is a continuous skill.  But skill increases only happen when the skill is first started.  Perhaps it should work more like swimming, and give a skill check at regular intervals.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Speed increase while hide and sneaking.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Allow the movement increases to start earlier, say at 41st level.  There have also been requests to allow a larger speed increase overall.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Tracking.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Many rogues have asked for some form of tracking, ranging from full-fledged tracking to dungeon or city only tracking.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Sense Traps.<P>DESCRIPTIONS:  Perhaps the range of this ability is too short.  Some also think that the reset time is too long, making it tedious to look for traps, and easier just to trigger them and deal with the consequences.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Stun with Backstab.<P>DESCRIPTION:  A sort of backstab, but with blunt weapons.  So if the rogue is behind the opponent and uses his backstab while wielding a one-handed blunt weapon there would be a chance to stun the target.  Such a backstab attempt might also do normal (not backstab) damage, to compensate for the stun chance.<P>STATUS:  N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item<P>---<P>ITEM:  Poison on thrown weapons.<P>DESCRIPTION:  How about the ability to apply poisons to thrown weapons.<P>STATUS:  N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item at this time.<P>---<P>ITEM:  Soulbound Lockpicks.<P>DESCRIPTOIN:  Rogues would like to have lockpicks that they can't lose.  Perhaps as the result of a quest.<P>STATUS:  N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item<P>---<P>ITEM:  Apply Poison Animation.<P>DESCRIPTION:  How about making the rogue crouch when he applies poison in a fashion similar to Bind Wound, so they don't need to stand after applying<P>STATUS:  N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item <P>---<P>ITEM:  Throwing Weapons.<P>DESCRIPTION:  It would be nice if there were some longer range, stackable throwing weapons.<P>STATUS:  N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item <P>---<P>ITEM:  Set Traps.<P>DESCRIPTION:  It would be interesting if rogues could to set traps.  Something like a pet that would spring out an bite the next thing to come by.  Only one at a time, hard to acquire components…<P>STATUS:  N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item<P>---<P>ITEM:  Hide/Sneak across zone borders.<P>DESCRIPTION:  It would be nice if zoning did not break sneak and hide.<P>STATUS:  N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Please do not change sneak to drop when you loot/trade/bank/etc.<P>This is a useful and very sneaky/rogueish ability in that it allows the rogue to bank/sell in places she would otherwise be KOS--the rogue is using their silver tongue and sneakiness to be able to make a trade "in the back of the shop".<P>It's been like this since launch and allows a little creative use of your rogue abilities to do something unique that not many classes can do.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First will i will adress the issue of sneak, sence this hits every rogue out there hard we are the most hated with merchants yet we buy where ever we please, sometimes getting us killed from a passing guard but most the time getting use by for food and water ect.<P>Most of us cringe at the idea of that going away when talking at a bank or store (including monks and bards) but i am sure that alot of the other classes find that skill to be unbalancing in some ways, and may not have been the orginal intent of the skill but i do hope that they dont take something that ingrained into the way any rogue monk or bard plays but as for that pesky hide not ungreying fixing that would rule even though any good rogue always checks his invis after doing something in a kos spot learn that lesson fast  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>--------------------------------------------------<P>As for haste on throwing and bows makes sence for all classes that use these skills. Even beyond that (i know rogue post) what about spell casting hastes hmmmmm.(back to rogue now). Why wouldnt something that makes you swing a sowrd or plunge or dagger faster also make you pull your bow or throw an item also faster.<P>-------------------------------------------------<P>locked chest would rule a rogue wet dream in fact,<BR>the day i see some one shouting out in ec "paying 100 pp for a high lvl rogue to pick chest dropped in seb." the idea of making locked items droped would add a interesting twist to loots ppl could auction off unopened boxes in hopes of good treasure and would add more use (to others) in the area of the rogue. also recomending putting in something to show the box has been unlocked but not looted so ppl dont worry about a rogue taking there stuff (why would we do that *innocent smile or close approximation of* " only had a rusty wep in it hehehe....")<P>--------------------------------------------------<P>Stun with blunts, mmmm blunts... ohh nm my bad, that would deffentially be a interesting skill to have and not to far fetched for a rogue, maybe even another skill besides bs that must be raised and used from behind make it though like monk special attacks so you cant just chain fire both backstab and that off at the same time.<P>another idea just inspired by that why not also make a skill that rogues can use with slashing used to pentrate the weak spots in armor in affect lowering mobs ac of course from behind and also done like monk skills a sorta of disarm armor<P>--------------------------------------------------<P>bs message to groups omg the spam one would get with a fully hasted rogue interesting idea but make sure there is a way to turn it off before you add it or possibily just change the color of text to make the bs message show up more<P>--------------------------------------------------<P>throwing and poison, a idea that maybe vi could consider beyound just poison for throwing weps (maybe require speciality foraged weps ment for use with poison)would be a line of crafted poison gases used via the throwing slot<P>1. Dust Cloud, when thrown has an effect that clears the thrower from agro list and gives a short invis of a few secs 1-2 at lower lvls maybe up to 6 make it a mid lvl poison round 120 skill, also possibily a improved version smoke cloud (more expessive to make and greater skill 160) that un aggros the whole group and give short invis.<P>2. Sleeping Dust, when used has a aoe effect that cuases mobs to fall asleep for a short duration, if attacked while asleep they will awake and return to fighting maybe also having a few tick slow after they wake would make sence<P>3. Flash powder, chance for a cool looking effect ,temporaily blinding (few ticks) all with in range including group members and doing a quick stun less then a sec. of course this is a higher lvl poison maybe 180 skill, could make a lesser variant that just blinds for a tick or two called sand ( what more rogue then throwing some sand in the face of the person your dueling, "rogues dont play fair where smarter then than being a meat sheild" heheh flame away wars)<P>4. Either, tosses that one out and cause an aoe intoxication more of a fun one to use during a duel<P>5. Stink Gases (needs better name), this one could be a group od deaise based gases, aoe effect<P>6. Acid, when thrown upon mob lowers there ac value by eating away there armor maybe little flesh while it is at it too. small ac negative factor and small dd possible to use via normal apply poison route also just hope it does ruin your dagger while doings it (aka better the acid higher chance it ruins the weapon used)<P><BR>oh yeah and just more throwing weps in general<P>bolos, spiked balls, nets(hmm snare effect possibily), boom a rangs (just better make the skill check to catch it hurts to get hit by it) ect.. ect.. and not just for rogue other classes throw<P>--------------------------------------------------<P>well i have ranted on for ever now so i will leave you all this to flame away at tell you see my name and a pile of ashes<P>Inda, Tribunal<P>"what you looking at me for should be watching your pockets"<BR>--------------------------------------------------<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My suggestion is leave sneak alone, but thats just me.<P>As for finding a way to fix agro problems associated with evade, I again urge the programs to examine they way they do mob awareness, if they limited the scope of awareness for mobs in the game, rather than being aware of everyone in the zone and instead just aware of pc's within 1x 2x or even 3x of their agro range, this would solve the issue of evade being currently "too powerful", without having to nerf it.

</FONT><HR>Hrm...  two issues I can think of.<P>1 - I know it's been beaten into the dirt, but the way evade currently functions is the ONLY way to counterbalance, to some degree, the damage we do as rogues.  Like others before have said, many times, last night being a great example, I will stop attacking, hit evade, and have it succeed... just to get aggro again with my next -regular- attack, much less a backstab... or it'll fail... or I'll be told that I must be standing perfectly still to hide.<P>Why is that?  Why not do two things - well, one, that does two.  Change it so we can start hiding on the fly... doesn't it make more sense that a rogue running from you can slip into the shadows as they go, or duck down an alleyway, or what have you?  This would not only increase our chances of survival (which are already good, but still nowhere as impressive as a monk feigning death.. but they should be best at that anyway given description) as well as make it possible for us to use Evade as a "constant" of sorts, in that we enter a battle and evade whenever we have the chance to, without getting the you must stand perfectly still message 2/3 of the time...<P>As it currently stands, evade does NOT make us invincible, nor does it take us to the bottom of the current hate list.  There's just no way.  While it may do something akin to that, there's no explanation for how I can successfully evade, supposedly be on the bottom of hate list, have cleric greater heal monk, have monk quad attacking for 23pts.... and aggro STILL sticks on me.  And monk is in closer physical proximity,a nd has worse faction with the creature due to more time hunted there.<P>Just be careful here, please... try to give us some techniques to counterbalance the loss of functionality we face... if we can't evade back, then we can't do our damage, and I don't want to spend my life backing out of battles AGAIN.  We already had to go through that impotence once.<P>2 - Increase our cap in binding wounds.  If not in the amount we can bandage, which would just be a wonderful addition to reduce downtime and make us less of a mana sink since we take heavy damage, then at least increase the skill point cap to 200 or something.  There's no reason a rogue shouldn't be able to bind wounds as well as any other fighting class... none that I can think of.  Bandaging is hardly a class defining ability, and even if it were, I would think rogues would be the best at it, as monks use their mental discipline to mend their bodies, and warriors just have tons of hp to suck up damage and rely heavily on the magic of others to heal their wounds.<P>The rest of the things I can think of have already been mentioned above, so I'll spare you.<P>-Dizriellna T'Vol-</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ummm.. yes you can apply poison in full screen mode i do it all the time.  it has to be in a base inventroy slot, not a container, however.<BR>also sneak should NOT break ever! (except when zoning or when hit as it is now) if that were so, sneak and hide might as well be one skill. sneak breaking more often would be a MAJOR nerf. sneak allows you to: trade with low faction merchants (which i always thought of as holding a knife to their throat), loot corpses in dangerous places with some safety if behind, keep from getting attacked by things you pickpocket (in the sense that hide breaks when you pp but sneak doesnt) so would therefore be a major nerf to pickpocket (note a serious failure still causes them to attack you, and if they hit breaks sneak), and also to lower aggro while backstabbing (you must stop attacking to start sneak though but it remains until you are hit, whereas hide breaks when you attack) so therefore would nerf the most important rogue skill, backstab. <BR>And it makes perfect sense that you can trade while sneaking but not hiding! <BR>Sneaker: Psst... can i buy some poison vials?<BR>Merchant: Well, I'm not allowed to sell those to dark elves...<BR>Sneaker: How about ones that have a knife to your throat?<BR>Merchant: errr.... so how many would you like?<P>Hider: Can I buy some throwing daggers?<BR>Merchant: Hello? Who said that? Is someone there?<P>A lot of the ideas are good though in my opinion. I am quite happy that some of the cooler ones actually made the list, like locked chests that can actually be picked and maybe be trapped, stuns with 1hblunt (why didnt i think of that?) and even setting traps.

</FONT><HR>Please do not have Sneak break when entering water, if it breaks that means we can't Hide and Sneak through water and would be a big nerf.<P>If Sneak also broke with merchants it would be even worse than than what I just mentioned.<P>And Evade does not work like you think, I have many times turned attack off, had a succesfull Evade and still had the mob aggroing on me despite having a warrior taunting, this is before I even start attacking again too.<P>I also agree about the Backstab message, it will make others start asking for a nerf to Rogue damage if there is a message on each backstab. It works fine the way it is, Don't fix what isn't broken.<P>26 Rogue<BR>Torvonnilous</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree that Rogue tracking skill is not something that should be considered, and also think that otherwise the list includes most of the things recommended by the Rogue community..<P>I do feel that Absor adding his own perspective to Hide failing and not ugreying, by adding his suggestion that Sneak should as well is not something that the Rogue community desired, and SHOULD NOT BE IMPLEMENTED. As other Rogues have stated above, the Sneak ability allows Rogues to deal with merchants who would otherwise not speak to thieves and even though Hide is removed when speaking to merchants, looting etc (and the button not ungreying) the Sneak ability is not removed when doing these things AND SHOULDN'T BE...<P>Also Rogues can currently poison in Full Screen Mode (despite many observations to the contrary), the only restriction is that the poison bottle needs to be in a main inventory slot, which is different than how it works in the framed mode.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000456-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000456-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000456-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum13&number=13&thisthread=000456&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum13&number=13&thisthread=000456&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
