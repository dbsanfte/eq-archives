</FONT><HR>Wow, what a thread.  This really sums up a lot of the high-end encounters well.<P>About Tashani:<BR>I consider the reduction in aggro a *NERF* for my class (I play an Enchanter).  I possess the option to cast or not to cast Tashani, but when I cast it, I know who's getting attacked (guess?).  That sort of control of the aggro is just what Verant is trying to prevent.<P>About using COH:<BR>Yes, many of us thought of this the first day of reading the patch message, and yes it will work. But this is one of may options which requires more people, more timing, more coordination and communication.  These things, VI/Sony's servers cannot provide.  If we can't do it with our current numbers, then it will not be done during 99% of server uptime.<P>About Generating Hate While Mez'd:<BR>No, this is simply not true.  I have tested it since the patch, and high level mobs still do not generate hate/chain aggro while they are mez'd.<P>Broken or Not?<BR>For the lower levels, No.  While there still is an element of increased challenge, all of the encounters at the lower levels are still doable with the same people.<P>For the top levels, Yes.  Some encounters are impossible, and the game doesn't even play the way VI suggests that it should.<P>The Result:<BR>Lower levels are more annoying, but they are overall not much different.  The top levels are DRASTICALLY LESS enjoyable, more frustrating and require an exhaustive increase in downtime... not to mention a now even greater dependency on MORE CLERICS.<P>Ask anyone preparing for a top level encounter how the start of their raids go.  They wait... and wait, and wait some more.  Eventually, when it's late in the day enough clerics have logged in to fare a chance at killing the target.  You can have a miriad of other classes in different numbers (or even zero), but you SIMPLY CANNOT do many things without 7-10 clerics.  That's why many of us have alt clerics... I have a Lvl 60 Cleric alt, myself.<P>Neurosiis Niakkard<BR>Blood of the Spider<BR>The Rathe Server<P>P.S. Split the Rathe, upgrade some server hardware, or improve internet communication...<BR>Please?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My experience -<BR>Small groups of 6-12.  We like to do things in a small group a lot of times, its more fun, more challenging, and you can actually accomplish quite a bit with a few strong players.  The one thing I've noticed is mostly with more than one mob, I'm talking multiple things 55+ in one group.  As SOON as a CH was casted, it was auto-aggro from EVERYTHING, many times including the main mob I was fighting.  Sometimes I was able to get them off the cleric before he died, sometimes not, it made life incredibly difficult running around smacking 4 mobs trying to pull them off the cleric, and really stupid and tiresome.<P>Now in large scale encounters the problem is multiplied.  In VP where tanks can't taunt for crap anyways, where group heals are used, it made this very nasty.  Clerics were the FIRST to die in most cases, and even if they didn't they had to go DA and couldn't heal their group.  In Velious aggro becomes extremely bad if the mob is not on one person, its almsot like a game of pinball (aggro warrior, aggro cleric, aggro cleric2, aggro druid, kill druid, kill cleric2, kill cleric, aggro warrior, warrior dies because of no heals).  Lots of fun let me tell you.<P>For Eduin -<BR>Eduin, you obviously have not actually played in high level encounters or else you would post where, when, how, and REAL experiences.  You've seen a monk tank a mob that hits for 500+?  Where was this?  Fighting Something as weak as Lord Doljorimorinor (or whatever) in Velk's Lab, once our warrior died the monk didn't last very long at all.  You know how much difference 1200hp and 100ac makes?  Obviously not or you wouldn't say let the monk be the main tank.<P>If a mob hits for 250 you MIGHT be able to have a monk tank, MIGHT, but you better hope feign doesn't fail, cause that's a dead monk, and even if it's successful it's still nerfed beyond the beyond the point this is plausible.  The more mobs you get, the more difficult it becomes to keep things off the cleric.  <P>Your "list" includes everything the high levels are attempting, the things we still find fun.  Even things like VP have become much more difficult, it's not just Velious.<P>Obviously FoH isn't just using the same strategy as everyone else, or at least it's more cleanly executed.  You think our military in the U.S. is dominating because we use drastically different "strategies" than other countries?  No it's because they are better executed, and we have better technology (better strategy, and better equipment in EQ).  Personally I think the idea of clerics binding outside of ToV was actually somewhat inventive.<P>And tell me, why should one race be required to tank, while another of the same class can't?  You think Fuuh can't tank because he's not an ogre (hell Furor is a human, bahaha!).  The differences in warriors are minimal, you MIGHT get 200hp more from an ogre, but doubt it since at the high-end uber level most will have 255stamina from equipment.  Does being an Iksar monk make you be able to tank as good as warrior?  Hardly, you have about 70ac more, and the same hp, and that doesn't make up for 1200hp of a warrior, and more ac.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I thinki the changes are going to require more diversity in the multi group raids.<P>Multiple pulls are gonna have to be handled differently.<P>If Clerics are getting waxed, Mages will find themselves busy with Call of Heroes.  Maybe even Necros will have to come along and sacrifice someone to get the clerics back down in deep.<P>There are solutions, it's just gonna take some thinking to get it done where before it was a simple formula.  I feel the changes make for a game that will require more teamwork and appreciation of more classes and their unique abilities.<P>Maybe the day of the cleric, warrior, chanter, x, x, x, are over.

</FONT><HR>The goal of this game is susposed to play like D+D. Imagine the 'new' terrain. We have a 'sacrifice farm' to fuel the necros.<P>They in turn pump the magicians. The magicians COH the clerics (and the timing is easy we do it all the time for pulls). <P>So a cleric gets a heal off and 2 seconds later gets COHed. Now the necro constantly pumps the mage. <P>Meanwhile the tanks do what they do. Even if this works its so moronic and stoopid I don't think any of us want to play this game. Verant would actually just in the next patch make COH transfer aggto to the magician from the COHed person if it got exploited like this, making pulling suck.<P>The real question posted is do we want to play a game where the cleric cant be taunted off by a solid tank. All they did was make another clas useless. They already nerfed Enchanaters and Shaman so why not add clerics to the list of useless SOV characters. We get to join Druids Necros and Magicians, well magicians just got moved off the list  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">, maybe necros with level 45 characters on second accounts also P.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;Maybe the day of the cleric, warrior, chanter, x, x, x, are over. I like it.<P>Get a clue.  <P>Number 1 tank that needs the least amount of healing: warrior.  Group size remains a limitation.  Too many people and lag and link deaths happen.  SK's and paladins don't have the offense.  Rangers match warrior offense but don't have the defense.  None of the tank classes can keep up with CH AE aggro.  Beating on mobs doesn't do AE aggro.  As for xp groups, proc'ing weapons + high dex still allow him to keep aggro.<P>Healer with the most hp's, ac, and low taunt heals: cleric.  The druid in his example got beat down.  He doesn't have the AC, he doesn't have the hp, he doesn't have DA or DB.  And he doesn't have celestial elixer and celestial healing.  The shaman profits some, but he's best off grouping with a cleric and focusing on buffs and slows.<P>Class you only need 1 of in SoV to buff with anyway: Enchanter.  Oh, and if you are talking about xp groups... you realize your tank can't tank 2 mobs at once anymore, right?  Which means you'd better have that mob mez'd.  Your cleric will also be using worse heals... you'd better have clarity.  And because heals aggro more, the mobs better be doing less damage (slow).  No, the enchanter has the most complete package (mem blur, mez, root, bedlam, slow, boon of the garou, haste) to control healing caused aggro.  You need one more than ever.<P>The only change for this is now you need more clerics to heal the clerics (why else do you think a level 60 warrior is playing a level 53 cleric?) and gimp tactics like battle rez'ing become more of a norm.<P>Before this change, my guild was ready to go for a couple of the big mobs.  We have a mix of classes, not tons of warriors like FoH.  Not tons of clerics like them.  But, well, now we have to put that off because of these changes.<P>The tougher you make things, the more you need the specialists.  If FoH could take down these drakes easy with their mix... then the rest of us could take them down with some difficulty with our class mixes.  Instead, they make it hard for a few select guilds in all of EQ and the rest are screwed.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The core problem here is that Velious was designed with cheal in mind.  It's the only thing that makes sense when the ubermobs quad-hit for 800 damage(3200 damage) each round.  So, the tanks go down quick.  Even the not-so-uber mobs that quad-hit for 250 damage(1000HP) are a bit insane.  Why should any mob hit like this if a single group is expected to be able to go into these areas?<P>Now that cheal is nerfed, the damage output of the mobs should be cut down to normal levels, since the hit points of the mobs are also insane. Wiz class mobs that have as many hit points as the melee mobs is just wrong.  And when these same mobs hit as hard as the melee mobs, you KNOW there's a design flaw in there.  <P>Verant, fix the mess you made.  Let the casters do enough damage to make a difference.  Let the healers heal without getting killed instantly.  Let the hybrid classes do a decent amount without giving them the melee abilities of dedicated melee classes.  And most of all, stay in touch with the players!  I've not heard a peep out of Absor, or anyone at Verant since the last patch.  The classes that have been neglected need attention.  The classes you've broken need to be fixed, and the players in general need to know you all care about more than what movie you will go out to see this weekend.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

But I assure you that for the High Level game the FoH way is boring, staid and of utterly no interest to anyone who likes challenge in their gameplay.<P>Regards,<BR>Eduin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

When Furor says,<BR>&gt;I made this game you play<BR>...I don't think he's too far from the truth. It's people like Furor and guilds like FoH that Verant has needed to rethink encounters for and design new zones to offer a challange. Jealous of them? No, not at all. It must be rough playing on the edge like that... the impression I get is they're either in WAY over their head due to Verant's "challanges" (read: over-compansation) or bored because they've done it all. Don't think that's how I'd like to play.

</FONT><HR>I'm a level 59 mage, and all I can see is a big nerf on the horizon for Call of the Hero should CoH'ing clerics become a standard practice to clear aggro and keep them alive.  Pretty sad that it's my first reaction after reading all these other accounts which mirror what I've seen myself.  I think Verant is honestly determined to make zones that are unbeatable by anyone, and they'll be doing it soon, if the recent changes to heal aggro and reduction of taunt are an indication. <P>The problem is that their design teams are all operating independently and don't seem to communicate at all.  The simultaneous reduction of a warrior's ability to taunt, with massively increased aggro on healing is a perfect example.  If people really took the time to figure out the possible impacts before they instituted changes, it would've been common sense to not apply both changes at the same time on the same patch.  Verant has a problem with Complete Heal not generating enough hate?  Fine, up the aggro faction on heals, but leave taunting where it is.  Is it still unacceptably powerful?  Ok, now on the next patch, lower the taunt potential of warriors.  The changes won't come all at once so you'll be able to see how things work, and no one can accuse you of firing off both barrels at once without thinking.<P>The other big problem is that they balance the game to things like the Donal's Breastplate and normally-cast Complete Heal, then they can't/won't lower the difficulty on these mobs once they've removed the factor they were initially balanced for.  The last few patches have become a steady march of "one step forward, two steps back," and it's starting to become simply tiresome.  The only thing the new aggro changes accomplish is to make the game more tedious and unfun.  The difficulty of EQ is one of the things that keeps so many people playing and having fun, but there's a point at which difficulty just becomes ridiculous, and I think these level encounters are fast approaching it, if they're not well past it already.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Complete Heal and Large Warriors in Epic encounters had relatively little application before Velious. Some encounters in Sky, but that was about it. Most ubermobs, which you probably never fought, were AE-based speed kills. That you don't seem able to tell the difference between how different encounters work, coupled with your obvious inexperience with the encounters they talk about, seem to make you singularly unqualified you comment intelligently on the effects of this change.<P>But then again, you're the same person who once proclaimed that by farming Fire Giants as a level 55 shaman, you were getting "loot that 99% of the playerbase will never see". Here's a tip, friend. You'll never be the best at this game. You won't even be particularly good. If you feel the need to be the best at some game in order to derive some sense of worth, I'd suggest aiming a little lower. Become the very best tic-tac-toe player you know, or something along those lines.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Eduin,<P>If you aren't concerned about the high-end game that takes a lot of time, why do you comment on it?  If you have no intention of doing zones like ToV and Sleeper's, why do you care what FoH says about these places?<P>From my reading, it appears that you are getting involved just to flame because you are talking about places that you have no interested in.  Atleast Furor has complaints about the game he is playing.  Who is the constructive one here?  Furor, along with other players, made a complaint and Verant will address it.  Or, you flaming FoH and looking like a troll?<P>Apparently, Verant believes things are broken as well.  They are making an attempt to correct both taunt and healing aggro.<P>As I stated before, the high-end game is clearly broken.  Verant stated that there is a cap on the amount of aggro that Complete Heal produces.  That cap is less than a fully buffed L60 warrior.  Even when Furor did more damage to a Drake than hitpoints of a L60 warrior, the Drake STILL aggro'd to the cleric.  Hence, the cap is not working as stated or intented.  Tactics are irrelevent.  The game is not working as advertised.  <P>This is like buying a car the is advertised to get 60 miles-to-the-gallon but only does 45 miles-to-the-gallon.  Sure, you can change tactics and make more trips to the gas station.  But that's not the point.  Most people would take the car back and get it serviced.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What Furor said is true, 100%. He just says it with a little more attitude(the man's got sass!) than others might. Does he have the right to this inflated ego? You bet your ass, he and the rest of FoH kick a lot of ass and set the pace for many of the other high-end guilds. Another thing that you know is true, but constantly deny is that fact that…<P>You want to be Furor! If you don't play a warrior then possibly you want to be Tigole, Thott, Nino or one of the other high-profile players of your class. Hell, maybe someone even wants to be me… wouldn’t that be something?<P>What I'm saying is, all of you people who read Whineplay don't look to it as your soul source of EQ knowledge(or lack there of). You read Caster Realm, Eqlizer, the FoH/LoS/Afterlife/Da`Kor pages, etc. You want to know what we're doing and what we are finding because it gives you direction. You want to see the new goodies posted on the spoiler sites so you know what the next armor/weapon for your Ranger should be. Take a look at those screenshots, 90% of them come from the same 4-5 guilds. Admit it or not, you envy us and we know it. You aren't exploring the unknown, Captain Kirk. You're constantly looking for the known, the known that we've shown you.<P>We don't talk down to you without being provoked first. We come here from time to time to talk about serious game play issues, not to whine about class envy or melee-binding. If we say something in the high-end game is broken, you should take our word for it. Why? Because we're there now and you will be someday too. Wont you feel like a complete and total idiot after ranting and raving about changing tactics only to arrive at the same conclusion as us, 6 months later? If you think that, somehow, you have the key that we're missing… you are wrong, dead wrong. No one in my guild, FoH, LoS, Afterlife, etc needs to be told about adaptation. We're on the front lines of change, we see the NERFs and adapt to them long before you even face the challenge. You think MOB X always had that many hit-points, AE or that number of attacks? You should ask one of us sometime, we'll probably tell you that you just fought MOB X version 3.0b.<P>Vendrix<BR>Da`Kor</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

If you have an Argument here, don't even regard Eduin's opinion... Why ?  Totally Bios and UnBios...  He has a lvl 60 Shaman, and anything that could be more needed or more powerfull than his Char...  Needs to be nerfed.   Not to say that he probably doens't have a clue on how to play his char, and also chances are... he got a good deal on E-bay...  But hey, let's not ponder that too much.<P>Again...  Eduin is a Troll, read all his points across the threads.  He bashes Clerics/Necros, and always says things to get them Nerfed.  And not only that, if you read his posts... you'll see that he mentions at time that he plays a Necro which he doesn't... and I think he also mentioned he plays a Cleric too... which is also another Lie...<P>Don't give him satisfaction of knowing he is getting to you.  Verant made some mistakes, even thought they are going in the right directions...  But Don't let Eduin get you more aggravated...  A troll isn't worth your time...<P>Well, that say...
