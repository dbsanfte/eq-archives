</FONT><HR>I would have to agree with the Summon Corpse issue. If we are suppose to use this as one of our defining abilities in uber-encounters. The rarity of this spell is definitely taking away from the class's 'defining ability'.<P>Also, I find it quite humourous that Absor would point out that he thinks we are whining that we can do mega-damage in these uber-encounters..... We are just asking to do SOME damage in these...<P>I actually QUIT playing a Cleric at level 16 since I determined it was a 'SUPPORT' role so that I could take up playing an 'OFFENSE' role... now I'm finding that the future for my character that I've leveled up to 40 is now going to be a 'SUPPORT' role again.... that's SCREWING someone over in my opinion... it's like false-representation!<P>As of this point, I've actively began exploring the Shaman class and considering SK or Cleric again... obviously the peak of the enjoyable period for the necro class beging to dwindle at 50.<P>40-Necro = Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Again, my point is not that our role has changed. That is ok, I fill the support role often enough in 6 person groups now. I am only a 35th necro, so I really am only speaking on info I have obtained here and heard in-game. However, it is a bug and a poor illusion effect that stops us from being offensive. This is not as intended, and should be corrected. I know that other classes have problems too post 50, but comparing problems is not what this post is all about. Simply, if we are to transfer mana for our main support, then lifetaps are very important. If we cannot deal damage because of a bug and an unintended effect (illusion), then that should be corrected. There are other issues as well (useless spells, high spell cost - essence emerald), but again the focus of this post is those three points. DOT bug, ignite/chill illusion problem, and mana transfer inefficiency due to lifetap resists. Please do not get sidetracked by the bantor. Smile - good morning too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I haven't bothered to read all the replies to this, heh, but here's my 2cp worth of thought.  I see both sides of this issue, yes, I play a necro, love the class.  Necro's are not useless on big raids.  This is where I agree with absor.  My role is very different to what it once was, now I spend more time pumping mana into chanters and clerics, but you know what?  WE WIN!  Alot of times, I'm the one who's able to get a cleric camped thanks to being able to hold the aggro on myself long enough.  I don't know many other classes that are as versatile as the necromancer.  We can do crowd control, we can heal, we can give our mana away, we have the BEST dot's in the game hands down.  Pet and Splurt.  If you can't control your pet then you shouldn't be so upset when the raid groups tell you to get rid of them.  <P>I am so sick and tired of the whining from all you people who can't play your class.  Make do with what you have, necro's are still the most powerful class in the game, always have been, always will be.  So what if you can't outdamage everyone, you don't have to do all the work when you have 30 or 40 friends with you.  I agree with necro's about the ignite/chill bones spells, but during a raid, about the only thing I do is backup my chanters and keep tight reins on my pet.  If anything, I think it all depends on the person behind the character.  <P>Fear kiting and doing the most damage is not what a necromancer is all about.  I don't like the fact that I can't get my lifetaps to stick on some mobs, but I deal with it.  Can't tap a certain mob, I tap something else or if you have a druid who's worth their weight in gold, get a regen, jeez.  First it was necro's complaining they weren't useful in groups, now that they are, they're still complaining.  When does it stop?  I'm not hiding anonymous on this post either, my character name is Aieklul, I'm a level 53 necromancer on Povar.  Ask anyone who's ever grouped with me and they'll all tell you the same thing, I do make an impact on my groups.  So this argument is a moot point.  Necromancers are still powerful, if you don't want to group, then don't. If you value your friends and like to group, learn how to make them better.  What makes them stronger and more efficient also makes you better.  <P>Also, NO dot's do not make mobs go poof anymore unless you get charmed, feared, or go linkdead.  I have yet to see a mob poof on me under normal circumstances.  I suggest to all those necromancers out there that are unhappy with their class to change to a different class.  For those people who aren't necro's and like to gripe about us, try it once or learn how to play YOUR class.  Every class is good at something, it all depends on how you play.  <P>Aieklul Soulleach<BR>53 Necromancer<BR>Povar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>BAD ANALOGIES<BR>Demrack wrote:<BR>&gt;"Ok, so if this is to be our only role in large raids where is the necro mana version of the cleric complete heal?"&lt;<P>Absor wrote:<BR>&gt;'Not at all. There are other things that a necromancer can do. You all eschew the use of pets on raids, but they work just fine against any creature that doesn't use fear. And there is Dead Man Floating, summoning corpses…<P>I'm not going to pretend to know everything about how a necromancer works. My concern here is that some of you are calling necromancers useless in any big raid, when it's not true. You may not be able to do a ton of damage to the boss monster, but that is by no means all there is to doing a raid. If you see massive damage dealing as the only way that your necromancer is useful, then that is where we disagree."&lt;<P>First off I was just debunking your cleric analogy because it made no sense.  You were comparing the Necro mana dumping capability to the clerics healing ability.  All I was doing was pointing out the serious flaws in that logic.<P>Second, Hmmm I wonder why you avoided the other statement/question I posed that pointed out the fact that not only are Clerics the healing/buffing class in uber raids, BUT they also have more offensive power in these raids than a Necro does.  Does that make any sense?<BR>THE DOT ISSUE<BR>Someone brought up the fact that mobs poof when dotted STILL (in a very sarcastic tone) and you COMPLETELY dismissed the post based on tone.  Ok...I'll point out how Dots make ANY mob poof. <P>1) Load up a mob with dots and everyone dies, yet the dots kill the Mob.  Poof no more Mob.<P>The REASON why you dont see this happen that often (but that doesn't mean it can't happen) is because the regen rates of mobs in non battle situations ESPECIALLY Uber Mobs is insane.   <P>2) Dots are on something and a mem blur effect hits the Mob in the last tick of damage dealing and POOF.  (this is more on the rare side but can happen if an ench is getting beaten on and he stuns then mem blurs to not be killed in places like the Planes.)(You also see this in PLing, but that really isn't a concern at all).<P>3) The unknown factor.  Sometimes they just poof, which is what use to happen alot.  No reason... just POOF.  This was commonly seen in large raids with multiple groups where no group did a majority of the damage and a dot killed the Mob.  I believe this one has been fixed, but then again that means there is something else that causes a Mob to Dot POOF for some unknown reason.<P>The first two are easily reproducable. The last is a mystery. <P>TRADEOFFS<BR>Well for starters, high level Rogues have the potential to do more damage per sec than Wizards.  And no downtime to med.  Plus with the Kunark and SOV Gear that casts spells the non spell casting melee classes are basically hybrids now with no exp penalty and 100 times more usefulness to a group.<P>Where do Necros fall.  Well, actually they still are VERY damn powerful in the soloing aspect of things regardless of other classes in the fact they have a powerful pet, powerful offensive and defensive/evasive spells.  Although there are alot of classes that post 50 can solo that weren't before.  <P>Basically what everyone is pointing out is that there should be trade offs for ALL classes which clearly there arn't.  You either play a class because you like the class or you play a class because it is a class that is useful in a group. <P>Take a look at Aradune's last post on Travel Time.  It talks all about "THE MOST EFFICIENT GROUP."  If I may be so bold, this group is An Ench, Cleric, Warrior, Rogue, Monk, and you pick your 6th member dependant on what you need.  Those 5 classes are all you EVER need in this game (save wizzies to port you to the planes). <P>The Necro posts are pointing out the EXACT same flaws that the Ranger, SK, and Pali posts point out.  That at high levels they are INEFFICIENT.  Meaning all aspects that class "X" could bring to a group is bettered by class "Y."  These complaints are passed off as class envy on the basis they are comparing themselves to the usefullness of others, but when you look at the root of the problem people WANT TO BE USEFUL!!!  It has nothing to do with who/what is the most powerful class in the game.  <P>SOLUTIONS FOR THE NECRO TO MAKE THEM MORE GROUP FRIENDLY:<BR>(Pick and choose as deemed appropriate)<BR>1) Better mana Dump ratio.<BR>2) Remove the 6 level cap on lifetaps post 50<BR>3) Readjust the resist saves of Lifetaps on Uber Mobs so they arn't resisted 99% of the time.<BR>4) Add a level 55 Shock of Poison Upgrade.  Makes sense due to the lack of partial resist DDs and it is a line that Necros already have but stops at lev 34 as of SOV.<BR>5) As a Necro I personally like the skellie illusion of IB/CB.  As a Ranger I HATED it.  As a shaman I could have cared less.  Look into alternatives to IB.  Hell you could give the same exact IB spell that didnt have the illusion and didnt stack (Yep IB and CB are DDs that dont stack.  Kinda weird) with IB and it would be ALOT more melee friendly.<BR>6) Dots that under NO circumstances will make the Mob POOF. (And be aware it WILL take time for people to trust this once it is an actuality).<BR>7) The agro on dots SERIOUSLY needs to be looked into.  (Other spells that need agro checked are Slow spells, and Snare.  Examples 1) One Snare from a Ranger taunts off a JUST Tashed or charm broken Mob off an Ench. 2) One cast of Turgurs on a 1/2 dead Hate Mob is an instant summon.)<P>Why is it that Ebolt is a higher taunt than Draught?  Ebolt is 110 up front with 1100 damage following that over a total of 42 secs.  Draught is 600+ as soon as it goes off.  <P>Maybe if the fast acting Dots Necros and Shaman have didn't equal a summon and most likely death they would be used more often.<P>A Nice afterthought: Possibly Resist buffs for pets.<BR> <BR>Seriously, look at the list.  None of the changes would effect overall game balance (the mana one may, but apparently Necros are to mana as Clerics are to HP so it only seems appropriate that they get spells along the same line as Cleric heals for mana).  They are Minor fixes that would make the class MUCH more user friendly in grouping/raiding situations.<P>Wow, long post.  I am tired I hope it somewhat makes sense.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You have said that a clerics role on a raid is to heal and to resurrect.  You also state that a Necro can do just as much by transfering mana to the cleric which becomes healing and by summoning corpses.  That is fine, BUT....   Clerics get unlimited, manaless AND componentless resurrections with their Epic item.  Where is the unlimited, manaless and componentless Summon Corpse spell on OUR epic weapon...   Where is the Summon Corpse spell that requires NO coffin?  I don't see clerics running around with 8 tombstones (that cost 150pp each) taking up their entire inventory in order to do what they are REQUIRED for in a raid....  Why must Necros carry around such things for 18 levels?  Would it be SO overpowering to take this component out of the spell or just make BOTH spells the tiny jade coffins?  For a cleric it costs 700 mana to do his job.  For a necro it costs a trip to his local guild, 150pp, the trip back AND the 700 mana.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My main character is a necro. I used to solo when I started playing, but now I prefer to group... I heal when there isn't a healer type, or an inept healer type... I disperse my mana to the other casters during downtime, this keeps my group ready to roll if we get in mess too soon... I mez when the situation calls for it... I debuff mobs when there are lots of tanks and let the tanks work with less risk and more effiency. The necro class has so much more depth than most people realize (that can even be said for most people who play a one.)<BR>I play many different roles in groups and all of them are fun for me. A necro can make a well rounded group very efficient. EQ is always changing, not always for the best, I feel hopeful that there could be changes made to increase our usefulness post 50. I'm not thrilled about playing a mana battery and a janitor, being able to debuff wouldn't be bad... lowering the MR on uber-critters would be better so we could do some damage. Pathing flat out sucks indoors and in many outdoor zones in Kunark it's not always easy to handle things when your pet blinks away. <BR>There are lots of necros and druids out there that still haven't learned to group... at this point I'm more concerned about that  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/redface.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hey Aieklul,<BR>Good post. The issue with the dot bug is that they poof if you are LD, feared, or charmed. That is the issue. No one wants to take that chance, especially since LD is so common on big raids. You would know more than me, I am not high level and have never participated in big raids. But I just wanted to clarify that. And regen will not come close to keeping up with our mana/hp conversion spells. You know that...but it is a good point that maybe regen combined with some heals from a lesser healing class could keep us going. But why wouldnt the lesser healing class just heal the tank instead? And the ignite/chill skele illusion really is silly. It has no purpose other than the cool factor, but it makes it not functional, so lets get rid of it...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The main point of emphasis of the debate is the fact that necromancers are the only class that is asked to radically change their entire role just to fit into an uber group raid.  Every other class provides the essence of their class to help group on uber raids.  Clerics buff and heal, tanks do damage, wizzies cast offensive spells.  However, Necros are asked to go from an offensive damage casting class to becoming nothing more than a disater relief class.<P>While a necro or two may be satisfied with this new role, this isn't the role that the people who play the class signed on for.  When we started our necro's we wanted to be damage causers who were feared for our mastery of the dead.  You didn't see the Denver Broncos ask John Elway to be the waterboy once they got to the Superbowl.  But in essence that's what you are asking us to do.  Sure he could have been one heck of a waterboy, but it would have been dumb and unfair to ask that of him.<P>We don't serve as mana batteries, we don't tp, we don't buff, what necros do is kill.  All we want is to do what our class is supposed to do.<P>No mob in the game should be 100% resistant to our lifetaps.  That directly affects our ability to heal ourselves, heal others, heal our pets, and regain our mana.  Ironically, it prevents us from being the mana dump as you imply we should accept.  And that doesn't even bring up the fact that as mana batteries, we suck.  This option isn't very realistic considering the total waste of mana in trying to transfer mana due to the ratio of our spells.<P>Our pets could be used better on these raids with two simple changes.  Change the pathing so the pet is less likely to aggro half the zone to get to the target.  Second, make the /pet back off command work from greater distances.  I won't even start on the sad fact our 49 pet is as good as our 59 pet, and that's straight from the horse's mouth.<P>Next mob's poofing.  Follow this logic will you.  Pet is considered a DoT spell.  When necro dies, pet dies, with me so far.  When necro fd's pet soon dies.  When necro goes ld, pet dies.  So why not the same with our DoTs.  When necro dies, DoT is cancelled.  Same when LD, or FD.  Then DoT of a MIA necro wouldn't be the mob's cause of death and the body would still be there.  Why wouldn't that work?<P>The fact that multiple necro's can even cast same DoT is dumbfounding to me.  You don't tell wizzies they can't cast same spell.  You don't tell rouges that only one can use a certain weapon at a time.  But if you did implemented the above change, you could allow dot's to self stack from multiple necros.  DoT are a quick way to get on hate list and if several necros cast DoTs they would be dead long before the DoTs took down any uber mob.   <P>Finally, ignite bones illusion was very cool.  I still like to use it just for the effect.  However, could you look at just bypassing the illusion when the necro is in a group.  I can certainly understand the tank problem with this spell, but it's really the only marginally effective DD spell we get.<P>54th Heretic<BR>Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have a level 45 de necro which I have parked for the purpose of leveling up my enchanter (curently 28 in 11 days 12 hours of play) and experience the otherside of the casters dilema - A totaly group dependant class.<P>Enchanters cant solo worth.. well.. you get the picture. (at least from what I have learned to date)<P>But, putting all that aside, I do have a suggestion to put forward to Verant about the lvl 50+ spell which infuses 1000 mana back into the necro.  IF is it true that 1000 mana at post 50 levels is about 1/3 of our mana bar, then that does seem a bit out of balance with our class. If we can transfer mana at all then we should be able to do it reasonably well (at high cost) post 50. <P>After all, some one had to sacrifice their experience so we could have access to that mana.<P>Possible modifications to Infusion (sp?):<BR>1) - Recast/recycle time upped to 15 min.<BR>   - component cost is as current <BR>   - Effect: FULL Mana bar recorvery (like a    clerics complete heal - only with mana)\<BR>   - Limitation: Make it uncastable while the necro is using any of their hp/mana transfer spells - like Lich, or Allure of Death for instance)<P>OR<P>2) - Recast/recycle time: 20 min<BR>   - Component cost same<BR>   - Effect: Targetable on others With Full Mana "heal".  If they are at zero mana - this will bring it to full agian. <P>Optional: Restrict this spell's effect to only those players that are level 50 or above.  Thus making it only viable in the uber mob fights or in a raid situation.<P>Since an eq day is aprox 45 min long, that would make it usable 2x a day (assuming you had the essense emeralds to use).  If you, the readers or Verant, feels that this is too powerfull, then make it castable once every 45 min like Harm Touch or Lay of Hands Series.  <P>Kinda hard to abuse some thing that only recycles once every 45 min.<P>If the infusion spell series had this type of effect I am sure the necromancer community would be very willing to accept the price of this spell line.

</FONT><HR>I do not play a cleric, but the issues of the poofing corpses effects all as far as planar raids go as well as dragons and other epic level encounters. Alan, in your post, you stated that level 55+ mobs should not poof. I am willing to accept that but, I am still conserned that that is not enough. I am level 54 and I see that many npcs in the Plane of hate are below my level. If only level 55+ npc's are gaurenteed to not "poof" then I would still discourage the use of DOTs during a planar raid because the majority of the npcs we encounter are below level 55 and they also drop the valuable loot that we work so hard to obtain. Due to the rarity of the loot that drops, the chance that even one npc corpse poofing due to a DOT is simply not acceptable.<P>E. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A few things, hopefully keeping things calm.<P>1).

This is all that really needs to happen, then they can be decent mana batteries at least (they increase mana regen at cost of health, but you don't leave them a way to get their health back).  Also, with tap, they can also be backup healers.  They can do almost everything at the cost of health, but you pulled away their ability to regain health from the big mob.<P>Of course, there is the trick of keeping a lesser mob around, rooted, and letting the Necro use that as a reserve of health, but this is impractical<P>-- Fabmatil Fabulous<BR>   38 Magician<BR>   Leader, Tribunal Judicator<BR>   The Tribunal Server<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Its time to start blurring the lines at these levels and spread out some of these class defining abilities so that everyone gets their share of playing and being useful at higher levels.<P>Lets face it, post 55 is all about uber mobs and epic quests, soloing is not a factor.  Another thing, this "paying to solo" BS has got to go.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am trying to figure out why a Necromancer has anything to complain about.  I think that it has been proven that they have some role in just about any encounter that you can think of.  Just because in one instance you are not the most powerful class you feel that you have a right to complain.  Get over it.<BR>Now that we are through with that subject, explain this to me:<BR>Necro's get to wear and use just about everything that a pure caster class can and they also get to use a lot of the stuff that pure casters can't use, along with all the uber stuff that is necro only and shadownight/necro only.  As a wizard it bothers me that they can use everything that I can use, unless of course it is Wizard only, and everything else under the sun as well.  There are many items that they have been wrongfully given a right to use.  <P>Mavrin, Wizard of the 46th Season<BR>Erollisi Marr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Actually Briljin (sorry if I misspelled your name) I'm right on track I think.  I rarely have trouble getting a heal since I have so few hp to begin with as do all pure casters, a celestial healing goes a long way.  I will admit, I have never fought trakanon or venril sathir, so I can't say how my dot's will affect the situation.  I do know that I have never had a corpse "poof" on me for using a dot other than the way I described earlier.  And if you read all 300+ posts you will see that some people went off on the wrong track, the other things I added into my original post were to show them they aren't useless.  <P>In my mind, the most fun in doing an epic mob is getting to that epic mob.  You don't just walk up to trakanon or VS and commence to killing, you do alot along the way.  I don't recall ever being able to zone into fear and walk up and start killing cazic right off the bat, heh.  I do what I can to get to those points in the game.  If being a killing machine works, I go with it, but if I have to play backup I do.  I would love to see our lifetaps not get resisted by every epic mob, would make things easier for everyone that way, but the point is to make us all be able to work together.  Clerics heal, so why can't they cast a low mana cost spell like celestial healing on us during an epic battle?  They can and do.  Regen is not meant to keep lich from killing you, if you don't know to turn lich off before you die, that's a personal problem. <P>Last I recall on a big raid, there were more than enough druids to keep the casters healed.  My point is to adapt to the situation at hand.  Don't dwell on the fact that you can't get up there and manhandle an epic mob like you do everything else.  Do people realize how useless some of the other classes feel on these raids?  In game, I'm married to a druid, do you know how useless she feels?  It's not just her, it's alot of classes, same for necro's.  We do not have to always be the ultimate killing machines.  We now have the opportunity to step into that roll of assistance.  Granted, it's not what we're used to doing, but we still have a roll and that's what counts. <P>I do understand the ld thing, it makes sense and I fully sympathize with people on this issue.  I think I covered this pretty well in my original post.  The main thread of this issue was that we were a dead class, I merely pointed out that we are not dead, it all depends on how YOU look at it.  I do think our lifetaps should work on these uber mobs, they are our signature class ability, just the same as a wizards mark of excellence is their ability to do high direct damage.  <P>Want to know what the number one reason for people not wanting us to have pets on a raid is?  It isn't the ld's or corpse poofing, it's the lack of control that quite a few necromancers have over their pets.  I leave pet taunt on during big raids, gets some aggro off the tanks, thus less healing clerics have to do.  Bone chips are far easier to replace than lost experience.  I also keep tight control over my pet so I don't go breaking mez all the time.  That is why people don't like pets is because a majority of necro's can't control them.  Never once have I been told not to use a pet for the reason that a corpse might poof.  <P>I do agree with some of the issues, but I cannot agree with them all.  As I said before, it all depends on the person behind the character and how well they play their class.  I do think the ignite/chill bones illusion is silly, no reason for it at all.  I do think that our lifetaps being resisted by epic mobs is lame.  I don't like being a mana battery all the time, but I get to do things at least, and I do make an impact on getting to the mob and for me, that's more than enough satisfation to have played a roll in something.  It's not all about me, it's about everyone involved.  <P>Think about the grand scheme of things and you'll agree.  While we have our legitemate reasons to be upset, Absor is correct, we aren't useless, it just depends on how you look at it.  Just answer me this honestly one thing honestly.  Would you rather not be able to participate in a big event and have to sit on your butt in town or something because you really couldn't do anything, or would you rather be able to be of some help, no matter how small it may be, and still have fun with all your friends on that big raid?

</FONT><HR>Absor, the major problem as I see it, being a 52nd level necromancer, is that the other players, such as yourself, who know nothing about necromancy, get *pissed* when we use a dot and they see "A Gorgon Dies." They see that and they go off because they know someone is using a dot and since a great deal of my spells are dots, they usually look to the necromancers (especially the necs that haven't been to a raid before). That means that, aside from my pet (which a good deal of raids escew since 95% of necs out there can't control their pets, making the enchanters work more), the only damage spell I can use is the poison DD spell from velious or a lifetap. I hate using lifetaps for DD since it's usually such an inefficient way to deal damage, especially considering it's a 5 second cast on a 20-40 second fight. I find I'm doing the debuffs, mana injections, DMF and that's about it on raids. The other players are *not* convinced that dot-death on mobs are fixed and I, for one, can't verify this. I have seen corpses poof from dots even when the caster was online (not feigned either). I've done some tests and if I cast splurt and an enchanter does a mem wipe on the tick prior to death, that corpse will poof. The hate list is not updated before the damage is added.<P>You mentioned earlier not knowing a way to fix pets when the necromancer goes LD? Well, since that patch 8 months ago, we can't log in again and even hope to just 'reconnect' so why not make the pet poof after 8 seconds of LD? In fact, why not just make all spell effects on a mob be removed after 8 seconds of LD? That would keep the aggro lower for the 2 minutes your husk stands there and keep your party safer as well as annulling the corpse poofing (unless it happens in that 8 seconds). The only other way I can see to fix corpse poofing is to cause the mob's corpse to always be there if anything is on the hatelist. By this I mean if JoeWar, JackDru and JohnNec are killing a gorgon and john uses splurt then goes LD (without pet), even though john becomes an npc, the hate list is still weighted with 2 pc names. That weight makes the corpse stay.<P>One last thing Absor.... Months ago Abashi told us that the ads on these board pages would be removed. I'm still seeing ads. My browser still reloads every minute while I'm typing. ***? I'm paying to play a game, post about it *and* see ads for crap I could care less for? Who cares about the disney channel and plays this game?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>hehe, now that i defended the positiion of necros and verant and sony...<P>my friend had a necro reach level 50 like over a year ago, before kunark. his 49 pet could solo a level 50 guard, no casting involved. now my pets have been solo'd by mobs 5 levels below me, and i once had a ghoul that had been green for 3 levels, waste me and pet (we both got rooted, pet was out melee'd, and ghoul resisted every, and i mean every spell i cast).<P>i was feared, while all my buffs were on, by a level 24 necro mob, while i was level 44. <P>me and pet were both charmed by a green mob  in najena dungeon (linara parlone) on her first cast (i died)... <P>i dueled a bard. i cant heal my pet in a duel, but he can charm it into NPC, and i lost exp when it killed me. one of a necros main strategies is pet attack, snare, fear, dot, and keep pet healed if mob is resisting. why is it that every other class gets their full line of spells in duels, even ones that can cost me exp, but i cant so something like heal my pet as usual (even though verant was kind enough to let it drain my mana down still)...<P>a level 15 monk (twinked) beat 4 of my level 24 pets, and took a 5th to half health before i needed to back it off so he didnt die...<P>what is the purpose of pets getting dual wield at 29, if arming them no longer increases their attack ability, unless the weapon has a proc...<P>now i know that when i created my necro, it said that this class is of high difficulty to play, but these are things that have either happened since i started playing (that has been changed) or should not occur to anyone, regardless of class. when was the last time you saw a level 24 necro succesfully fear an ice giant...<P>i know a level 54 necro that quit and is selling his account because he says its just not worth it or fun anymore.<P>im playing devils advocate here, because i just posted a message prior to this one regarding how we can still play and be useful in groups, even though our solo ability is somewhat diminished at higher levels. the only argument i have is that no other class (maybe druids, maybe) have to play any differently at level 50 than they did at 20. and i have never heard a cleric or enchanter complain about their roll in a group. <P>necros are penalized for their incredible solo ability they have from 1 to 50, and basically have to relearn how to play their class... show me a group that wants a necro that is just learning to play again... said necro or pet could get group killed (BTW, anyone that thinks pets have EVER been useful in dungeons, is dead wrong, from level 1 on up, pathing is bad, they warp through walls, attack mobs through walls, get lost, and train. its about all you can do to put it at the zone, guard it there, and pull mobs to zone (of course, we could go in dungeons without pets, but since we have lowest hp in game of any class, are pretty well more kos than any class, and dont have melee skills much past those of a level 16, due to being pure caster and all our weapons suck, that isnt a very likely possibility). we can group without pet, but at lower levels our group spells are non-existent or so pathetically inefficient, they arent worth using, and by time we get to mid levels, we finally get group spells, but then no one wants us. <P>the irony is, even if we can play our necro in a highly skilled and excellent manner, solo or group, we are most often relegated to soloing, which makes everyone want necros nerfed cuz we are too powerful... eventually, at the rate it is going, we wont be wanted in groups and will be unable to solo due to nerfs. that would make everyone else but necros happy then, and hey, majority rules (hehe, maybe they'll make us the evil version of paladins or rangers, just not as good).<P>so please quit nerfing us, our pets, and everything about us. either increase our group friendly spells, or leave us the masters of soloing. <P>p.s. "self only teleport to undead ruins would be a nice line of spells for necros, since we are kos by definition just about everywhere, and are taken advantage of by druids and wizzies more so than other classes, based on the necessity of teleports. while you're at it, give the wizzies a pet so they dont whine about us getting self tp and them losing out on money...."<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Forgot to add this to my last post.  Yes, you can summon a corpse in Kael Drakkel, it has to be done on the eastern wastes side of the zone, why, I do not know, but it can be done.  As for why druids don't heal tanks, haha, their heals are not all that great when they have to heal that ogre warrior who had 5k hp buffed.  Their best heal will maybe do one bub of hp.  That same heal will heal me close to full at one bub of hp.  This is why things will work if you aren't too proud to do it this way.  I don't mind dumping my mana onto the cleric's if it will help everyone out.  I'm just thankful I'm able to be of use to my friends and that I even have friends to be of use to.

</FONT><HR>I heard about this thread from casters realm.  The response from Verant it absolutely unbelievable.  I love this argument:<P>"Necros on epics have a different role"<P>No, THEY DO NOT HAVE A ROLE.  Necros are cheap manna batteries.  Right now, the only necros who get into epic raids are acting as manna batteries and summoning corpses.  SK's will soon be able to summon corpses, hence necros will go from dead to ultra-dead (and yes, it makes sense that SK's should summon corpses).<P>The mere fact that a 3:1 manna battery is all a necro can do is proof of how useless they are.  To say that 300 necro manna is worth any other classes 100 manna is correct, but the answer is to FIX THE NECRO.  And if Verant wants necros to remain viable solely as leaky manna batteries, then they need to up the ratio to at least 300:225 or 300:250.  I certainly wouldn't play my necro just to dump manna, but at least other necros who don't have uberguilds and twinks could have some semblance of life post 52.<P>Saying necros aren't broken post 52 is just like the old "alchemy isn't broken" or "mage pets are duel wielding" or "hasten is spawning as intended" or "the Aegis of Life spawns are working correctly" or "corpses don't poof due to dots" or "spells are dropping correctly".  Come on Verant, people are telling you that 52+ necros are broken.  Just fix them and let's move on.<P>Right now, I have a near 57 cleric who I'll take to 60 over the next few months.  After that, my 54 necro is perma-parked till they get fixed.  On a positive note, my 30 rogue twink get a trakanasaur tooth and a hangman's noose last night  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  You gotta love that "no drop" code Verant -- you force me to zone twice so he could loot the noose.  You guys keep telling yourselves that "no drop" works well....<P>Post 52, clerics, enchanters, meat shields, and rogues own the game.  Get 1 each of those, and add an evac class, and you are in business.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok Absor, here is an easy way to replicate the DoT Bug.  Take the lvl whatever Necro that Verant gave you, go out find any MoB, take it down to low hps (where it is trying to escape).  DoT it, and then immediately cast Screaming Terror (mem wipe which would be equivalent to you dieing).  Sit there and watch, it will poof, I guarantee it.  If you cant figure out how to do it, then come to Brell I can show you.  And if you do test this, test it on a regular server not the test, test doesnt work the same as regular servers do all the time.  This is evident in many of the past blunders that worked well on the test and totally screwed things up for a week on the regular servers.<P>Next Mana Transfer.  Let me start off by saying, to my knowledge, no other class starts off preforming one role, and then ends up in the last 10 lvls preforming another.  That aside, I wouldnt really have a problem with being a mana battery, if that is what I was.  Right now, we are no more than a mana buff.  Why bring a necro to give mana to the cleric, when you can bring another cleric, and get 2/3s more mana.  Also please explain to me how by making mana transfer 1 to 1 that it would give necros twice thier mana???  After 3 years of college, and every math class needed for a math major, I cant figure that one out.  Let me see if I can explain it in simpler terms that you might understand:<P>Johnny Necro has five apples (bubbles of mana), Billy Cleric has no apples.  Johnny give Billy one apple.  Now Johnny has 4 apples and Billy has one apple.  By giving Billy one apple, Johnny doesnt gain any apples, he looses them.  I think there is where you are getting confused.<P>Once again, if you want to make Necromancers a viable class after lvl 50, which you dont seem to want to do, remove all the spells that require an essence emerald, give us a mana tap spell at lvl 50, you can even make it so that the mana we tap go only to our group members and none to us, make the mana transfer spell more efficient, and make lifetaps unresistable (they are already high taunt so we will only be able to use maybe once or twice).   Finally fix the DoT bug.  By the way, fixing it doesnt mean making it so that DoTs dont work anymore.  The DoT bug shouldnt occur on lvl 1 MoBs, not just high MoBs.  <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>***Necromancers are the waterboys of the EQ endgame***<P>Imagine you are a player on a football team. You've played well and made a real contribution to the team all season. Then the playoffs (uber encounters) start and the coach (Verant) decides to bench you and make you the waterboy.<P>Sure handing out water (mana) to the players is important but you didn't make it all the way to the playoffs just to be a waterboy.<P>Verant has dropped the ball with the 51-60 game. Most of the problems in this message board have come from classes that feel useless and marginalized in these last 10 lvls. Since it takes twice as long to get from lvl 51-60 as it does from lvl 1-50, this is a serious flaw.<P>Absor, I feel you have fumbled the ball on this one. I for one put combined the wisdom and experience of all of the necros that have posted here against your vague knowledge of the necromancer class any day of the week. I feel that instead of being a representative of the players you have chosen an adversarial role instead.<P>The arguments put forth by the necromancer community on this board have been clear, convincing, passionate and thoughful. Yet you seem predisposed to find some way to disagree with them. I urge you to pull your head out of the fog that is The Vision (tm) and hear the concerns of the necromacer class.<P> Dornette<BR> 53 necromancer<BR> The Nameless<P>"necros should have to pay...." -Abashi, Dec.18, 2000<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Real quick, did Absor ever explain his statement that a 1:1 transfer ratio would double the mana of necros?    <P>Also, for those posts saying that clerics only get to heal during these uber encounters so we should be quiet, you are missing the point.  When you start a cleric you know your main function is to heal.  When you start a necro you know your main function is to lifetap and deal damage.   Clerics complaining about only getting to heal should not be clerics.  Necros complaining about only transferring mana should be necros.   No good necro would be happy with just dumping mana.  <P>However, with that said, if Verant would make the ratio better, even 2:1, you would hear a lot less complaining.   Here is the problem:   The ratio is so bad and we cannot lich without lifetaps so that in a single encounter we are able to give maybe 1.5 bubbles of mana to a cleric, ench or wiz.   In other words, just about useless.   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 10 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;9&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044299-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=044299&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=044299&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
