</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>There are things I would love to add to my last post but it seems like alot of it has been mentioned, however, from reading your post I see something I covered.  You mentioned mix feelings about CoE stacking....<P>Well I covered this and maybe you missed it so I'll do it again.<BR>1) Ranger Kills his CoE buff<BR>2) Chanter gives Ranger AQ or SLTW Buff<BR>3) Ranger Re-Buffs CoE<BR>4) Chanter can now cast augment of shissar on ranger w/out losing CoE<P>This is similar to bard songs stacking and the fix with celestial healing and chloro/regrowth.  The spells seem to be able to stack, lets just make it easier.<P>Thanks,<BR>Camoman<P>P.S. To anyone, ranger or not....I really don't see any arguments to why rangers should have pets.....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Another question I have is weather or not everyone truely feels that having not only significantly lower Defense, Dodge, and Parry skills, but also significantly lower Hitpoints is warrented? On top of that, our Armor is much lower AC. It definately puts us at an extreame low.<P>Wouldnt one or the other be significant? Honestly I feel like the fact that SK's and Palies having nearly the same defensive skills and HP as warriors, along with nearly equal and in some cases better armor, coupled with the fact that thier weapons being mostly 2HR's or 1HR's with shields, are significantly more powerfull to compensate the fact that they're slightly less effective, seems unfair.<P>From my viewpoint it seems that we pay a HUGE penalty for having dual wield, where Paladin's and Shadow Knights are paying a minor penalty for having nearly equal defensive skills and Armor.<P>Rangers<BR>-------<BR>Major Advantage: Duel Wield<P>Trade off: Much lower defensive skills, much lower Hitpoints, and much lower quality Armor. All directly related causing a major penalty.<P>Paladins<BR>--------<BR>Major Advantage: Nearly equal Defensive skills, Hitpoints, and Armor as Warriors, along with major focus on parent class(cleric) spells. Even gets ressurection at higher levels.<P>Trade Off: No Dual Wield, but weapons are made to compensate. <P>Shadow Knights<BR>----------<BR>Major Advantage: Same as Paladins in regards to defensive skills, HP and armor, plus one of the most usefull spells in the game "Feign Death".<P>Trade Off: Same as Paladins.<P>Am I offbase here?<P>Are 2HR's so poor compared to 1HR's? If so, why would classes that can dual wield ever use a 2HR as thier primary weapon in that case? So does dual wielding really warrant the major loss of defensive, HP, and AC? And if so, does it warrant 3 major losses that are all completely related?<P>Food for thought.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Isn't it obvious, if Rangers had decent hp and defensive skills clerics would have no one to ressurect.  Obviously VI can't raise our ability to take hits since doing so would be a slap in the face to clerics everywhere.  Without having a ranger in constant need of ressurections a party would have no use for a cleric at all.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> *******ABSOR NON REPEATED MATERIAL *******<P> Here's hoping you'll look at the last pages again since you stataed that you SKIPPED the section with My original post . I understand why Undue repition.My original post is as follows .<P>Hide(sneak)-<P>PROBLEM : Hide ONLY functions if immobile , with no way of knowing if successful(unlike Rogues) and if you sneak while hidden and start to move hide breaks .<BR>Now bards have this same problem . The reason I feel this is wrong is simply . Druids and Bards get an UNdiluted version of Track . yet the hide we get is obsolete before we get (Camo at 15 , HIDE at 25). and Superior camo later on . Looking at it from a balance issue giving us a skill that is effective Negated by other givin abilities removes some balance .<P>Solution : Allow our Hide to work just like rogue (and give our sneak the fail/succes message) BUT make them only usable out doors (eing an Outdoorsy class) that way you remove our hide/sneak ability indoors but increase tyem outdoors and maintain balance .<P><BR>Armor-<P>Problem : I've noticed a LARGE Disrcepency in the many magical armors givin out in Game .(I'll be using Chest armor in all referances for simplicity due to the large number of differant armor parts) I Pulled up ALL the Cheast pieces USABLE by the following classes WARRIOR.PALLADIN,SHADOWKNIGHT,BARD,SHAMAN,DRUID,RANGER .I found no less than 9 usable by WAR,PAL,SHD,BRD but were unusable by Rangers . ( you say well they can use palte RAngers can't) THEN I found 8 more that are also Usable by ROGUES, and or SHAMANS both of whom CANNOT wear plate yet while Rangers are left out of these pieces. all OF THESE are attainable on Norrath Not the plains . ALl are higher AC than and BEtter Stats adjustmants than ANY open to the RAnger . C'mon Guys SHAMANs being givin Better armor than us the guys in the thick . I even out of Curiosity Went thru all the Shaman and Druid specific Armors only to DIscover Nope RAngers can't wear ANY . Yet any Armor For RAngers (except Tolans , Ivy or Thurgadin RAnger , all types that other classes have counter parts to) ANYone else could wear. This SEVERELY limits and hinders us as a MElee Class .<P>Solution : Either a) change a few Items so we can wear as well . or else Maybe make some items drop that we can wear with other classes like SHM.DRU . <P><BR>I'll be happy to clarify or send all my research materials if you could use them .<P>Thank you for time .<P>Dubh Stormwarden<P>Ronin Ranger -Povar-</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well hate to be a doomsayer, but after reading your post Absor, I have little hope for ranger improvement.  The things you seem to want to "put on the list" are mostly minor tweakings.  Even if you literally gave rangers everything asked there, the ranger still won't find groups over a warrior/rogue/monk.<P>Until the ranger, and the other hybrids are put on equal footing with warrior/rogue/monk, these changes will have little impact.<P>Give ranger's equal defense to those three, then yup, equal footing there.  Sure they might complain, as I've noticed on some of the other threads, but that's just a monopoly now complaining that there is competition in the world. <P>Put group evac on "the list" please.  Dungeon play is where the action is at high levels. And rangers will be pleasantly surprised how more desireable they become by having this spell.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, I guess I better get a post in here before everyone feels compelled to RE-POST (not to be confused with riposte) based on your statement about not reading half of the previous suggestions.<P>My suggestions fall under the category of balancing rangers within the fiction and role established in EQ.<P>First and foremost I would like to mention archery since you acknowledged the line of sight requests that were made, but failed to adress any other aspect of the skill.  As an issue of balance, It seems fair that a Ranger would be better with a bow than other characters even before they are able to aquire any special Bows or Disciplines.  Take your pick as to which of the many suggestions would achieve this best.<P>On the hot topic of Defense, it seems that the most resounding request is to "help me live long enough to do the damage that I am meant to do."  This seems to spawn a myriad of requests, all of which could achieve that gaol.  You acknowledged that Dodge seems most in line with the character.  I would Strongly reccomend parry and riposte being a part of this solution as well.<P>In this same vein, Managing aggro seems like the next most logical aspect to this balancing act.  You acknowledged the Jolt comments, but I genuinely belive that managing aggro should become an aspect of the Ranger long before Jolt becomes available.  PLEASE consider a skill based solution like Evade or a pre-Jolt spell in that line.<P>In regards to Tracking, I wonder if you are really aware of the arbitray nature of what appears on a rangers track list since you insist on denying any kind of Bug-like status to the issues mentioned.  I could be standing next to a MOB and not be able to track it with my skill.  This is an extreme, and I would not need to since I couls SEE the MOB in this case, however it does illustrate how someone might feel they were given a buggy skill.  Especially when one considers the fact that a Druid of the same level would be MORE likely to be able to track that MOB than the Ranger would.<P>And finally the most frivolous request, which I only make since the proverbial door was somwhat opened in the changes described on the test server.  I fully support the inclusion of an Animal related spell, but a fear animal spell creates a world where Rangers would become an animal's most hated class since animals would become a Ranger's favorite victim.  PLEASE consider one of the many Charm or Pet suggestions proposed in this thread.<P>In conclusion, I can sum up my requests as: Balance archery; Dodge,riposte,parry style defense; Manage aggro earlier; Fix, yes FIX, Tracking; and include an animal Friendly spell or ability.<P>Finally I would like to say I love EQ, I love Rangers, and I love the fact that you are taking time to listen to us (sort of).<P>Thanks,<BR>-BizFu<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I guess I cheated like you Absor and just kind of cut to the end. After all some of us have been arguing these points for a year now with various people at Verant and I am sure most of you are well aware of the issues with rangers. <P>Clearly over the last 9 months Verant have been evolving the ranger into something closer to a Rogue/Druid than a warrior druid. We are becoming an offensive player with druidic magic than the pre kunark model of a warrior with druid magic. <P>That's fine with me, but on that basis I will just throw up some ideas that you didn't list on your summary. <P>Spell Selection<P>Clearly we are designed to be the offensive spell caster of the 3 hybrids yet from a very early age we are limited to one type of spell. The fire based DD with an occasional token DOT. Our druidic heritage shows spells in all schools of Fire/Ice/Magic/AE/DOT yet we have a very one track selection. This means there are large groups of MOBS where we have zero offensive spells availiable. <P>Swap one of our 3 fire DD's from 49 to 60 for an Ice/Magic spell. Most likely candidate for replacement would be Firestrike at 52 to be replaced with Ice ( probably too much damage ) , Fury of Air ( excellent spell with stun, something rangers dont get any other way ) , Lightning Blast ( AOE, upgrade of Careless lightning ) or a new spell you code with a nice fast cast time like Calefaction and CoF suitable for a melee caster. <P>DOT's Drones in the 50's is woefully underpowered ( its a 30's druid spell ) if Verant vision is for DOTs to be part of our arsenal then perhaps this could be tweaked, druids have lots of DOTs to look at. <P>Feet Like Cat - No upgrade ever ?<BR>Dex buff - Integral to archery and Trueshot, out of place to suggest a 15pt buff or something similar to FLC for Dex ?<P>Spell Effectivness<P>Jolt - you've covered. Too high, too heavily resisted, too expensive to chain cast. <P>Call of Earth - won't stack with Shissar/Augmentation/Augement the 3 most commonly used enchanter buffs for melee especially at upper levels for raids where the manaless Shissar rules the roost. As CoE has zero haste component and zero AGI/ATK boost I can't actually see why this doesn't stack. As a 60th ranger this spell is useless on raids and stays uncast. <P>Strength of Nature - won't stack with Paladin Divine Strength. Shame that the 2 spells given to hybrids to enhance us actually cancel each other out.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Coldain Shield of the Eight - won't stack with Call of Earth and in fact cancels CoE. However, Shield stacks with every other class damage shield spell in the game. This is just an oversight I think ?<P>The new spells on Test look good. <P>Skill Caps<P>Pretty much covered in terms of offence from the changes on test. Not clear if both Dual Wield and Double Attack are being boosted similarly or not ?<P>Archery to 252, only class that really uses archery especially now with Trueshot.. possible to boost cap from 240 to 252 ? Skill level is vitally important it seems in your combat model.. if I am hitting something 15 levels above me I need every point I can get or I just can't hit the target.<P>Defence<P>I am sure it has been covered above. 215 would be nice. At the moment I believe we are around 200-300 AC shy ( 980 for me versus high 1100's to 1200's )of the other melee classes a phenomonal gap given. Not convinved that our offence is good enough to warrant such a hampered defence. Happy enough to reevaluate this after the new skill caps go in but I think we will still probably be just a touch too weak defensively. <P>Other option is to really bump Parry/Dodge/Riposte high. That way if we avoid we dont get hurt and if we get hit we get creamed. The P/D/R route is probably more believeably RP wise but game mechanics wise I dont know if we would end up better "balanced" via boosted Defence or boosted P/D/R. We are the lighest armoured of the melees outside of monks so, shouldn't our non-armour defensive skills be much higher than others ?<P>Trueshot<P>With the last fix to TS I think you got the damage model much better balanced. Can you check if the boosted accuracy that was origninally in the discipline is currently working. I avg. around the 63% hit mark without the discipline and over 40 logged Trueshot attempts I average the same. The LOS issue you have already acknowledged and it is the single biggest issue with using Trueshot. It is almost impossible in a real game situation to get hits on a raid MOB consistently. I posted a number of logs at the Rangers Glade showing that under raid conditions on average more than 80% of arrows fired do not hit their target. This is a combination of Z-axis restrictions &  LOS blocking. <P>Some question as to whether or not a minimum damage for TS would be appropriate ( or for archery in general for that matter ) I still hit for 2 regularly. In the same vein, would Verant consider a damage model where the arrow damage is a multipler rather than a straight add ? As it stands now bow damage is BowDam+Arrow. So a Damage 8 arrow that costs several plat per arrow only boost Max Damage ( not the more common modal or mean damage ) by a couple of points over a 3cp damage one arrow. I know many rangers would happily use the 200+pp/100 damage 8 arrows if we could see an appreciable benefit to using them. <P>Plane of Fear<P>As a personal veteran of 53 Fear clearings without ever seeing a TV BP can you please look at this. All the MOBs in PoF that used to drop the armour now in Hate load empty permanently now ( Scraelings, 1/2 the Fetids, Worry Wraiths,etc. ). You could either reduce the # of empty mobs and replace them with the MOBS that drop armour or add more TT's. As someone pointed out there are like 30 Amy's in the zone and only 7 TTs. <P>Overall, if the vision is to make the ranger something like a spell casting rogue ie. we stand behind the MOBs and dish out damage then I think that as a whole you are getting closer to the mark. I still think for the defence we dont have that we dont offer enough offensive punch to justify our place in the world. A bit of tweaking on the offensive spell list, a bit on the melee and a decision as to whether we will defend via D/P/R+ Jolt or Defence and an adjustment to one of those systems and you will be getting pretty close in my opinion. <P>Sorry if I repeated too much of what has been said previously but its getting hard to keep up.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>Tullaian Starchaser<BR>Warder of Tunare<BR>Erollisi Marr<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor, <P>   Whilst skimming and/or skipping some posts you missed a major issue many many rangers brought up....<P>How are rangers to survive dealing out damage as an offensive hybrid? Rangers currently take a quadruple whammy in the defensive skills department. We have no Defense increase, Dodge/parry/repost are all well below that of true melee classes, HP's are extrodinarly low for sombody that takes as many hits as a ranger does. The AC on our armor is some of the weakest out there.<P>Now some of these penalties are needed to mantain class balance and others are not. First off I will explain the ones I agree with, and why. Followed by my disagrements, and thoughts on improvements.<P>Lack of Hitpoints - This is reasonable, personally rangers do not need the HP's of the other Tank classes and sit somwhere in the middle of the road. Take a ranger unbuffed and unequipped at 60 and you will probabbly find them somewhere above bards/rouges/monks but below pali/sk/war. This is ideal fits us just fine. Disregard all equipment, anyone can gear themselves to skew the stats including HP.<P>Low Armor Class on Equip - Once again this is just fine. We are a light tank, thus resulting in the use of light armors, similar to that of a rouge. Monks's armor is even lighter, thus resulting in the lowest AC per peice on melee equip. Pali/SK/Warrior armor is plate classed and ultra heavy, as a result it should provide better protection with less movement etc. <P>No Defense Upgrade - This I orginally agreed with UNTIL pali/sk/bard gained an increase from 230's to 252. Now the basis for my opinion on this is as follows. With a defensive skill in the 230's plate wearing hybrids tanked on par to our damage output as light tanks. 30 points of Defense is more than equal to 40 points of offense. The addition of very strong 1hd and 2hd weapons, as well as extremely good AC +stat bonuses on some sheilds pretty much makes up for some of slack of not having dual weild. Now explaining how I felt the old caps were balanced let me shed some light on what I feel is imbalanced about the "new" caps. While Plate hybrids gained somwhere in the neighborhood of 22 points in defense skill, the ranger only gained 12 points in offensive skills. 12 point in offense would only make a minor change in %dmg for a ranger, whilst 22 points in defense would make a significant change in a hybrid's ability to take dmg. Look at your own systems, people have parsed them out in the past and some of the tables and results are much to long to post here, when asking a dev member may just be that much more expedient. In order to retain the balance in offense/defense Ranger's should scale equally +22 points defense with the other hybrids, putting us at 222 Defense. This change would not make a ranger a tank due to their HP/Armor AC hit. However it would increase the survivabilty without having to rely on a spell, that currently is not a sure thing or even a 25/75 thing.<P>Dodge/Parry/Reposte skills - Naturally due to their lighter armor, a ranger should have more flexibility in avoiding a opponent. Dodge should be at a level above that of the plate hybrids yet below those of the light pure melees. Parry/reposte "should" be based off the weapon skill of the character, meaning its only natural that a person with higher skill in weapons should parry/reposte better and more frequently than that of sombody less able. Ranger reposte/parry should be above less capable hybrids, but below the more capable pure melees. This skills shouldn't just be a few points above the heavy hybrid tanks, but centered between the heavy hybrids and the light pure melees.<P>On ranger offense - As a side note I would like to point out that Ranger's while getting dual weild are not instantly 2 times as good as a pali/sk. Far from it in many cases we are only 25% or less better than our heavy hybrids, depending on equipment. This comes from the addition of very good ratio 1 hand weapons, and some very amazing 2handers, in addition to the higher lvl pets of Shadowknights that do dmg like having a similar (somtimes lower lvl) ranger with them as a pet.<P><BR>Now I am not saying all of the above "should" be implemented, but rather that is my outlook on how the class matches directly with the other melee's. As it is currently rangers rely on a very unstable source for both dmg and evasion of dmg. Spells, by properly balancing the melee skills of rangers you wouldn't  need to change jolt, you wouldn't need to shore up rangers with new or diffrent spells that add HP or AC (not that I am saying they are bad). <P>In closing I'd just like Verant to honestly sit down and test these final changes thouroughly, possibly even allow players to voulntarilly be moved to Test and then returned as they were before the move to their home servers for a period of a few weeks. This I think would most likely help more than any number of internal testers hackin away, its been admited before that active players can find bugs just as well if not better than the testers, and those who have had the most experience could probably give the most feedback when it comes to how their class plays.<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think one thing Absor didn't talk about was the need for more offensive output, both from melee and from spells.  <P>Melee, even with the same skills will be lacking compared to warriors due to triple attack.  I'm not saying giving us the same ability would be the answer, but since we are fairly focused on dual weilding, give us a slight damage bonus to our offhand.<P>As for spells, at 60 the only spell worth the time to cast is calefaction.  Everything else I can out damage by just melee.  I'd like to see not only a few more damage spells, but hopefully a cold based spell that is also quick casting.<P>Oh, and our groupability would be helped if we got more spells that buffed atk.  Call of Predator (group atk buff) is great, but the only of its kind and we get that at 60.  I wouldn't mind seeing more along that line, along with the Strength of Nature line (HP and atk buff).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor said, "Yikes. You're giving me mixed signals on this." regarding a player saying that it was no big deal to buff VoG and CoE.<P>Absor, this thread is absolutely huge and its impossible for every type of player to have the same opinion. Verant recently did 2 polls, one asking what level your primary character was, and one asking how many people you usually play with. This thread contains opinions from low level people who solo to players who ONLY do raids with large numbers of high level people all day, every day and everyone in between. This is one of those issues who's main effect is in raid situations. Sure, in an experience group, 24 or so more ac on the ranger might be worth the 325 mana it costs the enchanter to buff VoG. But if you look at the raid environment, it is not worth 325 mana x 12+ tanks so that the ranger can use his supposedly group friendly spell when the enchanter with epic can buff all the tanks mana free. <P>This being said, it seems that you didn't address a lot of the concerns brought up by high level rangers who's focus is on the raid environment. I personally feel that rangers are a very solid class to have in a small group environment, and that these changes on test are great for that. But, as a guild leader who leads 15-20 end game encounters per week, its very clear that high level rangers using epic weapons die a LOT on raids. Especially if they pull. I'm not going to repeat all the reasons why this is the case, but if you really want to see the issues rangers have in the end game, please refer to the posts of Anaxagoras and myself on the first part of ranger talk, and those of Sean, Tanthalar, and Zeyk on the 2nd part of ranger talk. Also, please look at how rogues and monks have excellant survivability because of their high ac while not being imbalanced because of their inabilities to tank due to having far inferior armor to plate classes. Rangers really need the same tools to avoid aggro as these other damage dealers, and any high level rangers knows that I'm not talking about jolt.<P>Faelagund Silvanfather<BR>Guildmaster, Silvan Rangers<BR>59th Outrider of Fennin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I play a 60 Ranger as my primary character. Let me write something we need to be useful in group or at raid post level 50.<P>1) Archery<BR>Apply damage bonus calculated by the same way as primary hand weapon, using DEX instead of STR in calculation. There should be some Minimum damage. Add some more for the bonus when we use Trueshot Discipline. Trueshot should also give us more accuracy in shooting. Rangers with Archery skill 230+ using Trueshot should not miss any single shot except dodged, parried or reposted attacks. Another idea I have and desire is auto-range-attacking like melee during Trueshot.<BR>Introduce a new Ranger only skill "Fast Shot" capped 200 at Level 50, 250 at 60 which works as decreasing Bow delay by (skill x 0.2)%.<P>2) Spell<BR>Give us an update of Feet Like Cat. Just give us  Nimble at low 50s or Ranger only spell which increases not necessarily significant but 30-35 AGI with long duration like 60-75 min. Jolt 2 is necessary at high 50s if you do not upgrade our defense. It should be 1sec casting and not resistible. Pack Spirit at late 50s is desirable, too. Give it to Shamans as well.<P>3) Equipment<BR>I understand Paladins and Shadowknights got better 1 hand weapons than dual classesÅf like Ebon Mace or Rod of Faith due to the class balance consideration. It looks fine to me Pallys and SKs have better weapons in order to catch up with dual classes to some extent in damage dealing. Then go back to see RangersÅf equipments. What we need? WhatÅfs the weakness of Rangers compared to Defensive hybrids? AC and HP! To balance all 3 hybrids, it is natural that Rangers receive better Armors as Pallys and SKs have better weapons. Our Armor should be better than theirs. Raise the AC of TV and Tolan armors at least equivalent to Defensive hybridsÅf Plane or Kunark Armors. Add HP +20 bonus on all parts of TV armors, +40 on all Tolans. TV BP, Tolans Leg and BP might well be implemented +100ish HP bonus.<P>Well,,, am I asking too much?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First of all thank you for getting rif of the exp. penalty for certain clasees.<P>The biggest problem i see with rangers is the lack or skill points in certain key areas.  Considering that Rangers are agile warriors who do not wear plate armor you would think we would be able to DODGE and PARRY and RIPOSTE better than paladins and SK.  Especially considering Paladins and SK wear heavy cumbersome armor.  However, the skill points in these skills are very puzzeling:<P><BR>Ranger:<BR>Dodge:  137<BR>Parry:  185<BR>Riposte:150<P>Paladin/SK<BR>Dodge:  155<BR>Parry:  205<BR>Riposte:200<P>My argument is, how can a class that wears heavy armor DODGE better than a class that wears light armor? The heavy armor is HEAVY and DURABLE because it's supposd to take the blunt of the attcack not dodge the attack. It's supposed to LESSEN the blow of the attack.<P>The Deffence and Offence skill points diffrence baffles me as well.  Rangers deffence should be as hight as SK/Paladin's Offence<P>Ranger:<BR>Offence: 240<BR>Deffence:200<P>Paladin/SK<BR>Offence: 225<BR>Deffence:230<P>Paladins and SK get 15 more skill points distributed to their offence/deffence.  When you factor in the bonus they get with dodge,parry,and riposte, and include the higher AC and HP's Rangers are largely underbalnced in comparision.<P>I would propose increacing DEFFENCE to 215<BR>Increasing DODGE to 160 (at least)<BR>Increasing PARRY to 205<BR>Increasing Riposte to 200<P>Other topics I see is with the issue of Thorny Vine drops in comparision with other class drops....NOT EQUAL at all.<P>Spells on Tolon's armor:<P>The BP spell is not balanced. Consider:  Clerics will use their spell from their armor CONSTANTLY, as will most other classes including SK and Paladins. <P>Rangers however will use the spell effect from their Tolon's BP maybe 1 time PER MONTH.  A gate spell to a continent that high level people don't travel to is not worth it.  <P>The change should be GATE to your bind spot or someother change.<P>Trueshot Disc should be available at an earlier lvl...perhaps Lvl 50.<P>I would still like to see a Class specific skill that only rangers can do...A ranger only Tracking skill was talked about back in Dec. but nothing has come of this.<P>I would like to thank you for your time and i hope to see good things from the future.  <P>Tallanvor Dragoonwolf <BR>Llv 49 ranger<BR>Karrana</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I really have only two comments, one major and one minor.  <P>MAJOR: We need an out to avoid getting clobbered by mobs at higher levels (I started having a noticable problem post 30).  I see several ways to do this:<P>1)  Lower jolt down to 49 and make it unresistable or at least less resistable, as it is when a mob is agroed on you you might not even be able to get it off.<P>2)  I like the idea of scrapping Jolt all together and just giving us evade.<P>3)  Make archery our defining skill at higher levels.  Make trueshot available earlier or maybe even a lesser version available at 49 at least.  The lost arrow and elevation issues mentioned earlier need to be fixed too.  It was very annoying when I was fighting Aqua goblins in Dagnors in my earlier levels when they were able to hit me but I just got a target is too high or low message.<P>Any one of the above three I feel would fix our higher level problems without needing to change our skill caps.<P>MINOR:  It seems silly being an outdoor master and only being able to bind in cities.  How bout a self only bind (no gate) useable only outdoors(not cities).  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Suggestion for Jolt line...<P>It occurs to me the most important factor in using any skill is practice. Take the spell 'Snare' for example. we get it at level 9, and 30 levels later some people still don't know how to use it effectively. Immagine what would happen if you were to give Rangers snare at, say, level 30. What would happen then? At level 30 we are already at a point in the 1-60 grind where using the Snare spell effectively is essential to individual and group survival. If we were not to get it until then there would be chaos as rangers were rushed to try to learn to use an ability they desperately need.<P>This is how I see the 'Jolt' spell. at level 55 we have already endured 5-10 levels of ineffective hate-list management, at which point we get this spell. Jolt is a godsend (except possibly in Velious, where it's usefulness is debatable). However, improper use of the Jolt spell can lead to the deaths of other party members, or even the whole party, including the ranger him/herself.<P>I propose a line of jolt spells, to be as follows:<P>Level 39: A 'watered down' version of the current Jolt spell. Getting a version of this spell early would allow us to learn how to use this ability in a time period where a mistake is not necessarily fatal. <P>Level 49: This is when we begin to truely need the version of Jolt that exists currently. Creatues in popular zones for these levels just hit too hard for us to be able to sustain our damage output without risking death. I propose moving the current version of Jolt to level 49 or 50.<P>Level 55: At this point the current version of Jolt is highly resistable in the sort of creatures groups typically face. Sometimes it just doesn't work. Sometimes you just don't have the precious seconds to waste on a recast when you had to wait so the creature didn't immediately turn on the Cleric when you Jolted. I propose a new, less resistable version of Jolt at this level. This would solve the problems of mana efficiency and lost damage output, as well as any hate-list management issues.<P>Thank you for your time, I hope you will consider this as a viable alternative.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I, as all of my Ranger brethren here, have a few issues I'd like to discuss.<BR>A ranger's symbol is a bow and arrow. However, Verant has made it clear to us in the past that archery isn't a vaible form of ranged combat. To that I say, then why even give it to us? <P>A solution would be to rethink the stance that spells should be the only form of ranged combat. I would propose a change so that Rangers only had the opportunity to use archery as a viable ranged combat system. To counteract the possible exploitation of archery, why not make a bow that is Ranger only and only fletchable by a Grandmaster Fletcher (nodrop) that does enough dmg to be considered a viable alternative to straight out melee.<P>Another solution: create a Ranger only Bow that does damage according to melee dmg modifiers, but have each "arrow" be a number of mana. This removes the aspect of manaless effective ranged combat. Also would be really cool to have effect be like a mini blue bolt spell flying from bow.<P>Which brings me to fletching. The promised upgrade is nowhere to be seen and other tradeskills are already being upgraded AGAIN. From a roleplaying aspect, I think Rangers should be synonomous with Fletchers almost. However, due to the inability to make back the money you put into the skill and the ineffectiveness of archery as a whole, my 202 skill in Fletching goes to waste.<P>Jolt<P>I think Jolt should either be made unresistable or transformed into a skill rather than a spell. This would cause it's effectiveness to go up as we increased in level, which is what I believe we're all asking for anyways.<P>Do not change Sow to 30.<P>Sow is a status symbol for us Rangers, and lessening the level by 9 only cheapens the fact that we have it.<P>Make Rangers be able to bind in outdoor zones ONLY. I should feel uncomfortable in the confines of city walls, why should I be able to bind there?<P>Make Tracking work.<P>Higher skill caps = worse tracker in current system. Create a scroll bar, filter, and a /trackplayers only command to aid us in finding ANYTHING in the outdoor zones, which is what we should be able to do anyways. A filter would be most helpful, and it could be done by either level (ie /track 35 45) or by color (ie /filter green to remove greens from screen).<P>Please upgrade our defense. We are far behind other melees, including bards now with test changes (/boggle). Others have covered this extensively, so I won't dive farther in.<P>Call of Sky should, IMO, should be group friendly a la Call of Earth. Groups would look for this spell especially pre-44 when Enchanters get boon of the garou (which doesn't currently stack with CoS).<P>Make our spells worth our time. Unless kiting (which you guys don't like anyways), our spells are often a waste of damage in combat. Until Call of Flame, any damage spell we cast will actually reduce our total damage output. For example, if I cast careless lightning, I do a maximum of 99 damage. In a normal melee round successfully duel weilding double attacking, I can do 100 damage easily. With a FBSS and any haste buff, I can easily go through 2, sometimes 3 rounds of melee combat in the time required to cast CL.<P>Also, buffs are near useless because of non-stacking issues. Give us some class only buffs (all hybrids) that would add a little spice to our lives (I know Call of Earth can be cast on others, but does not stack appropriately)<P>Jareck Thundershot<BR>46th Season Ranger<BR>Grandmaster Fletcher (202)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

As we now stand,in a group,we do OK damage(not    great,just OK),but require far too    much attention from the Cleric/Druid/Shaman<BR>   to keep us alive.<BR>   Solutions: Several things could help,take your    pick..Better Dodge ,Parry, Better Defense<BR>   What ever it takes,to make us less a burden in    a group.<P>2. Archery- make it a viable useful skill or       simply remove it,.....same for throwing       skill.(this could affect 1. above) <P>3. Useless Skills (or close to useless) - <BR>   Hide,Sneak,and "Good Lord!" a Rangers             Disarm.......When is the last time you <BR>   saw a Ranger dis-arm something?....give us        something that might be useful.<BR> <BR>4. Spells - Some of our buffs could be dropped a <BR>   few levels; then again this might be a help to <BR>   first point ( 1. above)<BR>   <BR>   Im a Ranger, why do I have to live (bind) in a <BR>   town ? : a self only "outdoor zone" bind is       only reasonable.<P>   Im a Ranger, why can I not travel quickly till<BR>   L-39 ? : same as above, self only SoW at L-22.<P>5. Tracking - Should be the defining skill for a <BR>   Ranger, some sort of filter for levels, names,    etc.<P>I know that we cannot expect all of these changes,but some balance can be achieved with these Ideas.<P><BR>    <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>How do you balance and undefined class? <BR>Please bare with me on this as there are numerous factors adding to this question. I will be aluding to comments made by verant staff but please dont ask me which ones. This goes back to the beginning of the game and has had many replies.<P>1. Rangers complained that they were no longer an effective tank past level 40. They have the lowest HP and AC by far of all the tank classes. Their low very low dodge and parry caps made them an even worse tank than a thief. This all adds to the nick name "Mana Sponge" as most clerics like to call them. Verants first reply to this was "Who said they were a tank."<P>Granted you eventually looked back over the class and granted them an increased cap on these skills post 50. By the time they are 60 their skills are competent for the level. But what about the long hard road from 40-60.<P>2. Rangers always thought (assumed) that they would be the masters of the bow. This idea was further justified when you started putting in many ranger only bows and quests for bows. Even in the beginning the Trueshot was a "signature" weapon of the ranger.<P>When critical hits for weapons were introduced rangers were granted criticals with only the bow. This once again showed people that rangers were archers. Then we found that warriors also shared that skill. We no longer stood out with the weapon.<P>The bow also proves to be too cumbersome of a weapon to use as your main weapon because of ammo supplies. You could fill your entire inventory with arrows and run out of ammo within the first hour of a camp.<P>When rangers complained about this and asked for a summon arrow spell or anything to truely make this skill our signature skill Verant replied "Who said rangers were supposed to be the masters of archery."<P>After all this when disciplines were given out rangers got "Trueshot" as their main attack discipline.  This is a nice skill that makes us usefull for 5 minutes every hour and a half.<P>3. Tracking was said to be our forte. The masters of the wilderness. There are many problems and issues with this and you are working on some of them. For that I am thankfull. However this is mainly usefull outdoors and does little to help us in the dungeon environments. Even outdoors until some changes are made to the skill there is little to no benefit of having a ranger over a druid.<P>4. When in outdoor encounters we are still wanted from time to time.  We are wanted for tracking, pulling, sows, and the ability to split mobs with harmony.  All of these skills are completely useless in dungeons.  In dungeons we are reverted to pure tanks since none of the skills we have are usefull here.  With our combat skills, hp and ac the lowest of all the tanks and hybrid tanks in the game it puts us at the bottom of peoples wish lists in dungeons.  More of a last resort than anything.<P>Give rangers a self only sow for indoors and increase thier base hp.  We cant pull when one stun from a mob will get us killed before we get back to our party.  Our hp are just too low for the high level encounters.  An indoor version of harmony.  In dungeons where mobs are almost impossible to split and mez is useless it would make the ranger truely an asset.<P>As you can see from above... Rangers arent master archers, they arent master trackers, they arent truly effective tanks and most of thier skills are useless in dungeon settings. You have stated so yourself. So if we arent any of those things what are we?<P>In the later stages of the game almost every class has something that sets themselves apart. A "signature skill" if you will. In the higher level encounters these people are coveted for them... but the rangers dont have anything and as such arent wanted. After all who wants a mana sponging half tank that cant take a hit.<P>My advice is this. Picture in your head what you exactly want a ranger to be and make them that....<P>If you want them to be archers then give them the summon arrows spell at low levels. Give them an added haste and/or damage bonus when using the bow so they can match or come close to the damage output done by dual wielding melee classes.<P>If you want them to be a tank then increase thier base HP to a respectable level or give them spells like the Shield of Words line that increases their HP a descent amount. The only time I was an effective tank was when we had a cleric and a shaman in the group both hit me with the shield spells. I wasnt a burden on the clerics then. Also increase their dodge/parry/defense caps so that they can be an effective tank.<P>Above all else give them a signature skill. One thing that sets them apart from the others and will be usefull to a group at all levels of play in all environments.<P>Until this class is truly defined there can be no balancing.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>** TO CLARIFY TRACKING **<P>We all understand the sorts, the cons and such things are enhancements to the tracking skill.<P>However, the fact that our tracking skill shows us a list of mobs, displayed in a fashion that seems to defy any real-world logic, should be looked at as a bug.  I have stood with nothing but 3 named Mobs in sight, and had only one of them appear on my tracking list.<P>Also, this is to whomever was complaining about my previous post, a few pages back, who said at lvl 26 I had no idea of the needs of the higher levels.<P>None of my issues addressed the post-50 game, I don't know it.  But I do know how to play my class, even at a mere 26.

</FONT><HR>I think a general concencious amongst rangers is that we dont want to become tanks with more ac. I like how rangers are unique. Not just half warrior half druid. But something else along with those 2 classes. Personally I would like to see the damage moved up to equal with warrior (as proposed in test) or slightly better depending on how much damage we can do with our spells as well. I'd rather see Rangers become the class that is hard to hit rather than the class that stands there and absorbs damage. So more defensive skill in dodge/riptose rather than more ac. More HP needs to be considered as a possibility as well. One thing I would like to see is upgrades to our current spell line. Feet like cat level 15 spell (no upgrade even post 50). More anti summoned line of spells late 50's. Paladins may be masters of undead bashin. But druids and magicians were supposed to be the masters of Summoned killin. Where are our spells of that line? Ever thought of creating ranger weapons with dismiss summoned proc?? (yeah ugh ranger GB copycat but it does make sense). <BR>One last note. Ever thought of giving level 60 hybrids the ability to cast bind? You'd think by then they would have been able to master a level 14 spell that their parent class has. Maybe make it a bind that still has to bind themselves in city location but at least they dont have to sit in town lookin for a bind forever and a day. (late at night its a pain when the 5 ppl in Freeport are either level 1-4 or couple other tanks who cant bind you either). My 2cp. Like the direction these balance talks have taken. With the exception of the gross encrochment on the clerics territory. Will discuss it under the cleric thread. =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I don't want to take away any cash revenue from Druids and wizards but I am sick of walking EVERYWHERE. Paladins and SK's BOTH get class defining spells from their parent class...Ranger's DESERVE a few gates. Before anyone gripes that it would cheapen the Tolan's BP,...ummm ALL of Tolan's armor is redundant already. Take the gate idea to the table Absor. It IS a VALID request. I can even suggest 3 perfect locations in the old world... Surefall Glade, Kithicor, and either Lesser or Greater Faydark...you can put 2 more on Kunark and Velious at your leisure. You every other class something they do best except rangers...don't try to throw tracking and archery at me either... We are not the 'best' at anything, rather we are 'good' at a lot of things. So this adds to the abilities, fun, usefulness ect... and thus brings the 'entire package' as you put it closer to balance. <P>Draxorian Stoneforge<BR>Pathfinder of Drinal<BR>Humble Servant of Clan Skallagrim<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Proposed FIX for Archery!<P>I haven't seen this mentioned but here's a way to fix archery.<P>If you wanted to kill something with a bow and arrow, wouldn't you shoot at the heart of the mob?<P>You have problems with line of site.  If you shoot at a hill giant, you are basicly hitting him in the shin with you bow on level ground.  <P>Would it be possible to program that you always shoot at the heart of the mob?  This would keep your shots higher off the ground and avoid alot of the LINE-OF-SIGHT issues that everyone is having.  This would also help with TRUESHOT during epic encounters with 30 or so melees attacking the mob.  You would shoot over their heads and hit the mob more often.<P>And please, no bind/gate.<P>If you don't want to give us evacs, give us some type of group speed buff for evac purposes.  Something like Group Spirit of the Cheetha but it would have to be able to be cast indoors.<P>Thank you for having this discussion.  It looks like Verant is finally moving in the right direction with all the classes.<P><BR>RangerD<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is something that just came to mind whilst reading through the Paladin balance thread, however it applies to all hybrid and their parent classes.<P>Now what I propose is that Parent classes, ie. Clerics, Necros and Druids be given special spells that will only work on the associated hybrid. These spells could come in at any level, but I was thinking that at upper levels they could embue the hybrid with abilities particularly aimed at boss encounters.<P>The idea here is that the Parent and associated Hybrid can be more potent when they combine their talents. So a Cleric/Paladin, Druid/Ranger and Necro/SK combined would be more powerful in high end encounters than either alone.<P>I think it would be necessary to make these spells quite powerful, since the combination is taking up two positions in the group/raid. Perhaps the spell could also have a detrimental effect on the parent for some duration.<P>Something along the lines of the Druid casting a short lived, but very high regen spell on a ranger, then not being able to cast any offensive spells for it's duration. Mitigate the effect of one buy affecting the other.<P>Well, I think you get the idea, something to consider. It would certainly encourage teaming between these classes, and assuming the spells are potent enough with others as well.<P>(Cross posted to all hybrid threads for opinions).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There are many valid points that have been brought up regarding things that should/"would like" to be improved with rangers as a class.<P>Our inability to take damage as a nimble light armor class (i.e. dodge/riposte/parry limitations combined with low AC, lower hit points and lower defensive skills).<P>Our lack of a class defining ability (that is currently fully implemented or even equal to other classes what also share this ability).  Along with no signature "spell/skill" from our parent classes.<P>The disappointment with archery implementaion into the ranger class (i.e. basically ineffective for anything other than long range pulling prior to disciplines).  Also shouldn't double damage shots at least be able to work on rooted mobs?  As of yet with an archery skill of 200 can only do double damage shots againt initially standing or snared fleeing mobs.<P>Even with the limitations of the ranger there still is not another class I would enjoy playing more.  I just hope that eventually we will be able to enjoy our heritage and skills as rangers.<P>With deepest regards,<BR>Roark Deathstalker<BR>51st season Pathfinder<BR>Proud Half Elf and follower of Karana <BR>(the double whammy of rangers it seems)<BR>-Luclin Server-</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The idea Arcanthis presented is a wonderful idea. Not that a Cleric has trouble finding a group, but it would seriously help Druids/Rangers, Necros/SKs and Paladins getting into groups. I'd love to hear ideas to what these "parent-child" class duability  specials could be!<P>--Dark, 51 Half-Elf Ranger</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
