<p class="body">Xabulaz opened his eyes and slowly shook off the grogginess that sub-dimensional transportation 
always left with him.  Immediately, he recognized his surroundings.  The tall, white spires; the scaled figure 
clad in white; the autumn-colored leaves on the nearby trees: Kunark, he was home.  He immediately felt better.  
Despite his hard exterior, the Iksar always felt uneasy travelling abroad...he knew where he was not welcome.  
His people were much maligned, and had it not been for the wonderful Softskins he had met that he now called 
friends, he would have believed the legends he had heard as a hatchling to be true.  The sudden appearance of a 
tall, dark, largely be-foreheaded figure interrupted his thoughts.</p>

<p class="body">"Well, we seem to have arrived in one piece." stated Xabulaz, in mock surprise."<br>
The newcomer replied, "Did you expect anything less from me, my scaled friend?"<br>
"One never knows with you, Bandeko."  They both laughed.</p>

<p class="body">Then Xabulaz's features hardened, if such a thing can be said to occur in one already so hard 
skinned, as he was suddenly reminded of their true purpose in the Dreadlands.  "We must make haste, Ramsly is waiting."</p>

<p class="body">As if on cue, both travellers were surrounded by a sudden aura of red power as their feet were 
granted magical speed.  The two charged off in the direction of the tunnel to the Frozen Tundra, leaving the Lost 
Valley behind them.  The rolling hills passed quickly beneath his nimble feet, as Bandeko followed behind, levitating 
high above the mountains.  Xabulaz was reminded that not everyone was as gifted in handling the steep slopes of the 
mountains as he was.  Or perhaps it was simply that Bandeko did not like snow.  Xabulaz chuckled.</p>

<p class="body">In a short while, the snow began to subside, and a hint of greenery could be seen.  More striking, 
however, were the large patches of desert, remnants of the giant meteors that had rained down from above eons ago and 
scarred the ground here forever.  Many of Xabulaz's people had been destroyed by the flaming rocks from on high, and 
he tried not to think about the terror they must have felt.  He shuddered visibly as they travelled the pock-marked 
landscape.</p>

<p class="body">"Something wrong?" asked Bandeko, who had settled back down to the earth.  Xabulaz smiled, 
"Just a chill is all...come, we are nearly there."<br>
"I think I know the way at this point, sir," Bandeko retorted.<br>
"Ah well, it is good to see that forehead is for more than just looks."  Xabulaz eyed his friends skull protruding 
from beneath his hood.<br>
"This from the lizard in the dress!" Bandeko exclaimed.  The two laughed together.  Xabulaz enjoyed trading barbs 
with Bandeko over nearly all else.  To an outsider it might seem the two were enemies, certainly the inhabitants of 
Cabilis would never believe such a friendship could exist, yet it did none-the-less.  Despite appearances, 
Xabulaz had a great respect for Bandeko.  Though Bandeko was no match for him physically, the wily monk knew that 
Bandeko need only utter a few words to summon forth the whole of the elements to utterly destroy him.</p>

<p class="body">The chattering of foreign voices snapped Xabulaz out of his reverie.  They had arrived at last at 
the former castle of Karnor.  Other adventurers sat loitering about the entrance.  Xabulaz turned to Bandeko, the 
two exchanged a glance and a nod, and entered the castle.</p>

<p class="body">Inside, the howling of dogs could be heard, and the stench of death filled Xabulaz's sensitive 
nostrils.  He fancied that had it not always been that way, his blood would have run cold.  Bandeko's voice 
pricked up his ear, "There!"  The wizard pointed straight ahead.  Xabulaz smiled as he recognized the faces of 
his good friends.  There stood Greggor and Corben, the two Barbarian brothers, almost inseperable.  Tralik ran about 
here and there, looking agitated as usual.  Happydog sat in the back, recovering his mental energy.  Hawkeslayer 
stood by nobly, as only a paladin can, brandishing a weapon easily half his body weight.  As Xabulaz continued to 
survey the crowd, a lone figure wearing a form fitting, yet morally questionable outfit, stood up.</p>

<p class="body">"XABBY!" cried Nelyene.  A broad smile spread across Xabulaz's face and a mischeivious light 
danced in his unusually blue eyes as he nodded at the petite, impossibly red-headed wizardess.  He muttered 
something inaudible to Bandeko, and the two chuckled.  Nelyene pouted.  "Oh, come on, you love it, Nel!" Xabulaz 
said slyly.</p>

<p class="body">"The Hell she does!" shouted a voice.  A blonde figure, clad in ornate armor, stood up, a fire 
blazing in her eyes; it was Braquelle.  Behind her stood a smallish, fair skinned elf clad in a dark robe with 
a bemused look on his face.  Bandeko groaned, "Farous, can you control her please?"  Farous smiled and shrugged,
palms opened and outward.  Laughter broke out among the ranks of adventurers.  All present knew he had no 
chance of fulfilling Bandeko's request.</p>

<p class="body">Xabulaz began to look around again.  "Where is Ramsly?"  If there was anyone Xabulaz respected more than Bandeko, 
it was Ramsly.  If Bandeko was analagous to his brother, Ramsly was his father.  A Human of the same profession as 
himself, Xabulaz was convinced that no one did it better than Ramsly.  If the Iksar desired one thing, it was to 
one day know his job as well as Ramsly...or be half as good at it.  "He will be back shortly..." Happydog answered,
with a slight smile.  Of course, Xabulaz knew what this meant.  Quickly, he sat down and began to concentrate.  
Centering himself, he began to focus his energy, his ki, as he had done a thousand times before.  A faint glow 
began to emenate from his fists as he sat in deep concentration.  Suddenly, a cry rang out:</p>

<p class="body">"Inc a drolvarg warlord, be ready all!"</p>

<p class="body">Behind him, Xabulaz heard the sounds of swords being unsheathed, and robes unfurling as people 
stood.  Words of power flowed into his ears as the wizards began to chant their spells almost in unison.  Beside him, 
Farous' pet seemed to suddenly develop a bad attitute.  Xabulaz smiled to himself.  The real fun was about to begin...</p>

<p class="body">- And then he went Linkdead ;)</p>
