	<font size="-1" face=Verdana,Arial>
<p>	As the creators of Epic Force, we, the original 5 founders (Badnewss, Bandeko, Happydog, Ramsly, and Tralik), want to welcome you to our Guild.  <br>
<br>
Although we began the process, the guild truly belongs to us all and will only be as good as its members.  We the founders are one of you.  We play the game for fun, friendship, and adventure.  To further promote the enjoyment of the game, we decided to start this guild so that we could organize a little better, as well as stay in close contact with friends we have made along the way.  We will strive to maintain the guild to the best of our abilities so that you too may share in the enjoyment we have been fortunate enough to experience thus far.  We are very laid back here at Epic Force.  While there is a command structure out of necessity, Officers or Senior Officers are only players too, just like everyone else.  You don't have to salute any time you see an officer or any nonsense like that.  Officers are here to serve, not be served.  We hope that you will find our relaxed atmosphere appealing and join us in our adventures.  Our wish is that by banding together, we can accomplish far more than we can as individuals, and in all likelihood, make friends along the way.
</p>
</font>
<br>
<br>
<font size="+1" face=Verdana,Arial><div align="center"><b>Charter</b>
</div></font>
<br>
<br>
<p>Epic Force is a guild dedicated first and foremost to having fun in the world of EverQuest.  Most of us, however, have the desire to obtain our Epic Weapons at some point.  Helping each other complete these quests is our main focus or goal, if you will, as a guild.  With that comes a sense of loyalty and responsibility to each other.  We will strive to support each other, and offer assistance in any way we can to our fellow guild mates.
</p>
<br>
<br>

<b>I.	Membership Guidelines:  </b>
<br>
<br>

<ol><li>In order to discourage riff-raff members, guild membership will be limited to those individuals with at least 1 character level 40 or higher unless otherwise approved by at least 2 senior officers.  Characters below 40 must be sponsored by at least two senior officers in order to be tagged.  We welcome all races and classes.  We even welcome lower level characters provided you are willing to take the time to seek sponsorship.  
</li><br><br>

<li>Alternate Characters below level 40 may be tagged if you wish, but will not be eligible for looting privileges from Epic level encounters.  Occasional raids geared for lower level characters will occur periodically where alts may be used and will receive looting rights within the guidelines outlined in the general event rules.
</li><br><br>

<li>New members will only be tagged by guild officers, and any prospective member must be approved by at least one officer.  Any member is eligible for Officer status.  Officer status is awarded to those members, regardless of level, who have proven their dedication and dependability to the guild through prior acts.  We hope for all our members to earn the right to be an officer at some point, all it takes is dedication.
</li><br><br>

<li>Failure to follow established guild rules will result in a review of the character involved.  Punishment will be determined by the guild officers and may include removal from the guild if the offense is serious.
</li><br><br>

<br>
</ol>
<b>II.	General Event Rules</b>
<br><br>

In general, the vast majority of steps in Epic Quests can be completed by the individual without help from the guild.  However, inevitably there will come certain steps, which require additional aide from the guild.  We hope that this guild will provide a reliable means for us as members to complete these quests, since as members, we now have access to a group with common goals.  Below are the general guidelines for how to go about organizing a raid type event required for finishing a step in your Epic Quest.
<br>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Before requesting a raid to complete a step in your quest, you must have participated in helping at least 2 other guild mates complete steps for their epics, or receive prior approval from at least 2 senior officers.  This is to prevent people from tagging, getting the help they need, and then de-tagging.  We feel that you should be willing to give, before you receive.
</li><br><br>

	<li>Before requesting a raid to complete a step in your Epic Quest, you should have all prior steps completed and ready to go.  If we schedule a raid and come time to go, you are not at a point where the raid can be used, you have wasted everyone's time.
</li><br>
<br>
	<li>Schedule a date on the guild calendar if at all possible for when you'd like to hold the event.  Include time and location of the event, as well as a brief description of what is to be done so that fellow guild mates who sign up can prepare accordingly.
</li><br>
<br>
	<li>Spur of the moment events can be held, but don't expect everyone in the guild to drop what they are doing to come help.  Try to give advance notice if possible using the calendar.
</li><br>
<br>
	<li>When the time comes for the raid, the person who schedules the event will be the raid leader.  The raid leader may ask someone else to actually give the marching orders during the event if he/she so desires.
</li><br>
<br>
	<li>All item drops from a successful raid that are required for completion of the raid leaders epic will be given out to the leader first.  All other eligible classes present will roll for any additional items involved in epics.
</li><br>
<br>
	<li>Class specific items will be rolled for by those of the appropriate class present at the time.  If none are present, the items go to the general loot pot for distribution.
</li><br>
<br>
	<li>Non class specific items will be rolled on first by anyone present that WILL USE the item on their character present during the event.  
</li><br>
<br>
	<li>Rolling for loot for alternate characters will not be allowed unless, the character you are playing DURING the event is there because of necessity.  If this is the case, you must declare prior to the raid that you wish to loot for an alt.  At that point, you are only eligible for loot for the alt.  You may not declare eligibility for the character you are playing and the alt at the same time.  Additionally, the alt must be over level 40 to be eligible.
</li><br>
<br>
	<li>If the item being rolled for will replace an item, you must give up that item to be rolled on by any other person present that can use your old item. If no one present can use your old item, it will go into the general loot pot, to be rolled on later.
</li><br>
<br>
	<li>Any item not claimed by a class for use, or for quests, will be place in a general loot pot, along with any items being replaced as a condition of rule 10.
</li><br>
<br>
	<li>The general loot pot will be rolled for by all those present who have not yet received an item.  After receiving an item, you may not roll again until everyone else present has received an item.
</li><br>
<br>
<li>	Non-guild members present for the event WILL be eligible for any items that make it to the general loot pot.
</li><br>
<br>
	<li>Loot won from the general loot pot may be used however you see fit, be it twinking, selling, etc…
</li><br>
<br>
	<li>Any disputes will be resolved by a guild officer if one is present at the time.  If no officer is present, the event leader shall have the final say.
</li><br>
<br>
	<li>Ninja looting will result in immediate disbarment from the guild.
</li><br>
<br>
	<li>Failure to abide by the rules established herein will result in an inquiry by the guild officers, and possible deletion from the guild.
</li></ol><br>
<br>
<br>

<b>III.	Guild behavior guidelines</b>
<br>
<ol>
<li>	No whining.  If you have a problem with the guild or another guild member, discuss it privately.  If no resolution can be found, contact an officer to resolve the dispute.  Persistent complainers will be removed from the guild.  Basically, if you don't like the guild, leave.  We want people who want to be here, to help each other, to have fun doing it.
</li><br><br>

<li>	Respect your fellow guild mates.  Badmouthing another guild member will not be tolerated.  If you have a problem with that person, see rule 1.
</li><br><br>

<li>	Help out.  The premise of this guild is that by working together, helping each other, we all benefit in the long run.  This guild will provide opportunities to its members that many guilds or individuals cannot.  For it to work, you must be willing to help each other.  There will never be a requirement for you to participate in any event, other than that you must help 2 other guild mates before you can schedule your own event.
</li><br><br>

<li>	Be fair.  If you have been extremely lucky on rolls for loot or have done well money wise, skip a turn or offer to give your winnings to a guild mate who may not be so well off.  This is not a requirement, merely a suggestion.  Likewise, don't gouge your fellow guild mates for services or items.  
</li><br><br>

<li>Last, and most important, have fun.  This is a game, nothing more, nothing less.  
</li>
